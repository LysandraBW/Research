More-\nover, these cells fulfill homeostatic functions beyond defense, \nincluding tissue remodeling in ontogenesis and orchestration of \nmetabolic functions (1\u20133).\nCells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage are characterized by \nconsiderable diversity and plasticity. In tissues, mononuclear phago-\ncytes respond to environmental cues (e.g., microbial products, dam-\naged cells, activated lymphocytes) with the acquisition of distinct \nfunctional phenotypes. In response to various signals, macrophages \nmay undergo classical M1 activation (stimulated by TLR ligands and \nIFN-\u03b3) or alternative M2 activation (stimulated by IL-4/IL-13); these \nstates mirror the Th1\u2013Th2 polarization of T cells (2, 4).\nThe M1 phenotype is characterized by the expression of high \nlevels of proinflammatory cytokines, high production of reactive \nnitrogen and oxygen intermediates, promotion of Th1 response, \nand strong microbicidal and tumoricidal activity. In contrast, M2 \nmacrophages are considered to be involved in parasite containment \nand promotion of tissue remodeling and tumor progression and to \nhave immunoregulatory functions. They are characterized by effi-\ncient phagocytic activity, high expression of scavenging molecules, \nthe expression of mannose and galactose receptors, production of \nornithine and polyamines through the arginase pathway, and an \nIL-12loIL-10hiIL-1decoyRhiIL-1RAhi phenotype (1, 4). M1-M2 mac-\nrophages also are distinct in their chemokine expression profiles.\nSignals including IL-10, glucocorticoid hormones, molecules \nreleased from apoptotic cells, and immune complexes also pro-\nfoundly affect monocyte-macrophage function. These signals induce \nexpression of functional phenotypes that share selected properties \nwith M2 cells (e.g., high mannose and scavenger receptor expression), \nbut are distinct from them, for instance, in terms of the chemokine \nrepertoire. Operationally, we refer to these cells as M2 like (5).\nPlasticity and flexibility are key features of mononuclear \nphagocytes and of their activation states (2, 4, 6). The pheno-\ntype of polarized M1-M2 macrophages can, to some extent, be \nreversed in vitro and in vivo (7, 8). Moreover, pathology is fre-\nquently associated with dynamic changes in macrophage activa-\ntion, with classically activated M1 cells implicated in initiating \nand sustaining inflammation and M2 or M2-like cells associ-\nated with resolution or smoldering chronic inflammation (9). \nIt remains unclear whether the mechanism of these switches \ninvolves the recruitment of circulating precursors or the reeduca-\ntion of cells in situ. However, it is now apparent that specialized \nor polarized T cells (Th1, Th2, Tregs) that are key orchestrators \nof macrophage polarized activation (2) also exhibit previously \nunsuspected flexibility and plasticity (10).\nHere, we will focus on recent progress in understanding the \nmolecular basis underlying macrophage polarization, including \nsignaling pathways, transcription factors, and epigenetic regula-\ntion. Moreover, the dynamics and limitations in our understand-\ning of polarized macrophage activation in vivo will be discussed, \nfocusing on selected pathological conditions (for references to \npathology not discussed here, see Supplemental References; sup-\nplemental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/\nJCI59643DS1). Previous reviews also provide a framework for \nthis work (1\u20133, 6, 11).\nMolecular determinants of macrophage polarization\nA network of signaling molecules, transcription factors, epigenetic \nmechanisms, and posttranscriptional regulators underlies the dif-\nferent forms of macrophage activation. Canonical IRF/STAT sig-\nnaling pathways are activated by IFNs and TLR signaling to skew \nmacrophage function toward the M1 phenotype (via STAT1) or by \nIL-4 and IL-13 to skew toward the M2 phenotype (via STAT6) (3). \nM1 macrophages upregulate IRF5, which is essential for induction \nof cytokines (IL-12, IL-23, TNF) involved in eliciting Th1 and Th17 \nresponses (12). The IL-4 type I and type II receptors (1, 13) acti-\nvate Stat6, which in turn activates transcription of genes typical \nof M2 polarization, e.g., mannose receptor (Mrc1), resistin-like \u03b1 \u2002\nMacrophage plasticity and polarization:  \nin vivo veritas\nAntonio Sica1,2 and Alberto Mantovani1,3\n1Istituto Clinico Humanitas IRCCS, Rozzano, Italy. 2DiSCAFF, University of Piemonte Orientale A. Avogadro, Novara, Italy.  \n3Department of Translational Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.\nDiversity and plasticity are hallmarks of cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. In response to \nIFNs, Toll-like receptor engagement, or IL-4/IL-13 signaling, macrophages undergo M1 (classical) \nor M2 (alternative) activation, which represent extremes of a continuum in a universe of activation \nstates. Progress has now been made in defining the signaling pathways, transcriptional networks, \nand epigenetic mechanisms underlying M1-M2 or M2-like polarized activation. Functional skew-\ning of mononuclear phagocytes occurs in vivo under physiological conditions (e.g., ontogenesis \nand pregnancy) and in pathology (allergic and chronic inflammation, tissue repair, infection, and \ncancer). However, in selected preclinical and clinical conditions, coexistence of cells in different activation states \nand unique or mixed phenotypes have been observed, a reflection of dynamic changes and complex tissue-derived \nsignals. The identification of mechanisms and molecules associated with macrophage plasticity and polarized acti-\nvation provides a basis for macrophage-centered diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.\nConflict of interest: Antonio Sica has received grant support from Johnson & \nJohnson.\nCitation for this article: J Clin Invest. 2012;122(3):787\u2013795. doi:10.1172/JCI59643.\nscience in medicine\n788 \nThe Journal of Clinical Investigation\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 http://www.jci.org\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Volume 122\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Number 3\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 March 2012\n(Retnla, Fizz1), and chitinase 3\u2013like 3 (Chi3l3, Ym1) (14). IL-10 acti-\nvates STAT3-mediated expression of genes (Il10, Tgfb1, Mrc1) asso-\nciated with an M2-like phenotype (4, 15, 16).\nSTAT-mediated activation of macrophages is regulated by mem-\nbers of the SOCS family. IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3, the latter in concert with \nTLR stimulation, upregulate SOCS1 and SOCS3, which in turn \ninhibit the action of STAT1 and STAT3, respectively (17, 18).\nDownstream of, or in parallel with, the IRF/STAT/SOCS pathway, \na panel of transcription factors orchestrates polarized macrophage \nactivation. The nuclear receptors PPAR\u03b3 (19) and PPAR\u03b4 (20, 21) con-\ntrol distinct subsets of genes associated with M2 macrophage activa-\ntion and oxidative metabolism (Figure 1). Interestingly, STAT6 coor-\ndinates and synergizes with both PPAR\u03b3 (22) and Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 \u2002\n(KLF4), a member of a family of proteins that contribute to macro-\nphage function (23, 24). KLF4 cooperates with Stat6 to induce M2 \ngenes (Arg-1, Mrc1, Fizz1, PPAR\u03b3) and inhibit M1 genes (TNFa, Cox-2, \u2002\nCCL5, iNOS) via sequestration of coactivators required for NF-\u03baB acti-\nvation. KLF2 regulates macrophage activation by inhibiting NF-\u03baB/\u2002\nHIF-1\u03b1 activities (25). IL-4 also induces c-Myc activity in human \nmacrophages (26), which controls genes of M2 activation (Scarb1, \nAlox15, and Mrc1) as well as STAT6 and PPAR\u03b3 activation (26).\nTLR engagement leads to NF-\u03baB activation and production of \ninflammatory mediators (27) associated with M1 macrophages. \nHowever, NF-\u03baB activation also activates a genetic program essen-\ntial for resolution of inflammation (28) and for M2 polarization of \ntumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) (29). Moreover, induction of \np50 NF-\u03baB homodimers is essential for M2 polarization in vitro and \nin vivo (30). The hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 are \nexpressed differentially in M1- and M2-polarized macrophages (31) \nand regulate inducible NOS2 (M1) and arginase 1 (M2), respectively.\nFigure 1\nMechanisms of macrophage polarization. The major pathways of macrophage polarization are outlined. The crosstalk between the M1-M2 macro-\nphage\u2013polarizing pathways is also indicated. The balance between activation of STAT1 and STAT3/STAT6 finely regulates macrophage polariza-\ntion and activity. A predominance of NF-\u03baB and STAT1 activation promotes M1 macrophage polarization, resulting in cytotoxic and inflammatory \nfunctions. In contrast, a predominance of STAT3 and STAT6 activation results in M2 macrophage polarization, associated with immune suppres-\nsion and tumor progression. PPAR\u03b3 and PPAR\u03b4 control distinct aspects of M2 macrophage activation and oxidative metabolism. KLF4 and KLF2 \nparticipate in the promotion of M2 macrophage functions by cooperating with STAT6 and suppressing the NF-\u03baB/HIF-1\u03b1\u2013dependent transcription, \nrespectively. IL-4\u2013induced c-Myc activity controls a subset of M2-associated genes. IL-4 also induces the M2-polarizing Jmjd3-IRF4 axis to inhibit \nIRF5-mediated M1 polarization. IL-10 promotes M2 polarization through the induction of p50 NF-\u03baB homodimer, c-Maf, and STAT3 activities.\nscience in medicine\n \nThe Journal of Clinical Investigation\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 http://www.jci.org\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Volume 122\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Number 3\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 March 2012\t\n789\nEpigenetic changes and noncoding RNAs also participate \nin directing macrophage polarization (32\u201334). IL-4 induces \nupregulation of the histone demethylase JMJD3 in mouse macro-\nphages, which alters chromatin modifications to promote expres-\nsion of M2 genes and inhibit M1 genes. miR-155 was recently iden-\ntified as targeting the IL-13R\u03b11 subunit, thus decreasing a set of \nM2 genes in human macrophages (35).\nPathology\nResolution of inflammation and repair. Remodeling and repair occur \ndynamically during ontogenesis and inflammation, and these pro-\ncesses are orchestrated by macrophages.\nMacrophages undergo dynamic changes during different phases \nof wound healing. M1-polarized macrophages mediate tissue dam-\nage and initiate inflammatory responses (1, 2). During the early \nstages of the repair response after wounding the skin, infiltrating \nmacrophages have an M2 phenotype and their depletion inhibits \nthe formation of a highly vascularized, cellular granulation tissue \nand of scar tissues (36). Under these conditions, the removal of \napoptotic cells (efferocytosis) (37, 38) and the presence of TGF-\u03b2 \u2002\n(39) may skew macrophage function, though demonstration of \nactual in vivo relevance of these findings is lacking.\nIn a peritoneal model of inflammation, resolution phase macro-\nphages expressed a unique mixed M1-M2 phenotype, and cAMP \nwas essential to restrain M1 activation (40). In humans, chronic \nvenous ulcers (CVU) represent a failure to resolve a chronic inflam-\nmatory condition (41). Correlative analysis in patients and a \nmouse model suggested that in CVU the infiltrating macrophages \nfail to switch from an M1 to an M2 phenotype (41). Notably, iron \nmetabolism is differentially regulated in polarized macrophages \n(42). In CVU, the iron overload in macrophages sustained their M1 \nactivation, leading to ROS-mediated DNA damage, fibroblast cel-\nlular senescence, and defective tissue repair (41). It is tempting to \nspeculate that similar mechanisms may underlie M2 functions in \npatients with severe burns, where hemorrhage and tissue damage, \nalong with the high release of iron by M2 macrophages (42), may \nresult in high iron tissue levels (43).\nDynamic changes in the phenotype of recruited mononuclear \nphagocytes have been observed in models of ischemic heart disease \n(44), suggesting that this is a general feature of the natural history of \nrepair processes. In a murine model of hind limb ischemia, haplode-\nficiency of the oxygen sensor prolyl-hydroxylase PHD2 induced the \ncanonical NF-\u03baB pathway in macrophages, which promoted their \nM2 polarization and proarteriogenic phenotype (45). This obser-\nvation may suggest a functional link between oxygen deprivation, \nas occurring in wounds and tumors, and progressive induction of \nproarteriogenic M2 macrophages. Thus, although the macrophage \nphenotype in resolution need not be a phenocopy of in vitro\u2013gener-\nated M2 cells, preclinical and clinical evidence support the long-held \nview of a key role of polarized macrophages in tissue repair.\nIn a model of retinal neuropathy, mononuclear phagocyte infil-\ntration generates a neuroprotective microenvironment promot-\ning retinal progenitor cell survival (46). The interplay of polarized \nmacrophages with stem and progenitor cells is likely a key com-\nponent of their role in repair and remodeling, although the actual \ntissue-protective significance of polarized macrophages in degen-\nerative diseases and their involvement with stem and progenitor \ncells remain to be determined (see Supplemental References).\nMacrophage activation has been found in autoimmune and \ninflammatory diseases and in particular in lupus nephritis \n(47). In a murine model of SLE, proinflammatory activation \nof macrophages was sustained by Notch signaling (48). Con-\nversely, the acute phase protein serum amyloid P (SAP) skewed \nmacrophages toward an antiinflammatory M2-like phenotype, \nthus alleviating lupus nephritis (49). In RA, a major source of \nM1 cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-12p70) (50) in the joints are \nthe synovial macrophages, whose number correlate with the \ninflammatory disease activity (51). On this basis, PPAR\u03b4 and \nPPAR\u03b3 are considered potential disease-modifying drugs for RA \n(52, 53). In a murine model of experimental colitis, recruitment \nof CCL11-expressing Ly6ChiCCR2+ inflammatory monocytes \ninto the colon correlates with eosinophil infiltration and his-\ntopathology (54).\nInfection\nBacteria. M1 macrophages are generally considered responsible for \nresistance against intracellular pathogens and characterize infec-\ntion with Listeria monocytogenes (55), Salmonella typhi, and Salmo-\nnella typhimurium (56), as well as the early phases of infection with \nMycobacterium tuberculosis (57), Mycobacterium ulcerans, and Myco-\nbacterium avium (58, 59). Uncontrolled M1 inflammation associ-\nated with acute infections with E. coli or Streptococcus sp. causes \ngastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, neonatal meningitis, and \nsepsis (60). The M1-M2 switch observed during the transition \nfrom acute to chronic infection may provide protection against \noverwhelming uncontrolled inflammation; however, a phenotype \nswitch can also favor pathogens that have evolved strategies to \ninterfere with M1-associated killing (58, 61\u201364).\nChronic inflammation and granuloma formation are char-\nacterized by the presence of macrophages with an epithelial \nmorphology and by macrophage homotypic fusion with the \nformation of multinucleated giant cells (MNG) (65). IL-4\u2013medi-\nated upregulation of E-cadherin, which engages in intercellular \nhomotypic adhesion, is likely to underlie MNG formation. STAT6 \ndrives expression of E-cadherin and DC transmembrane protein \n(DC-STAMP; ref. 66) during MNG generation. The actual func-\ntion and role of MNG remain elusive.\nParasites. In experimental and human parasite infections, macro-\nphages generally undergo a dynamic switch toward M2 polariza-\ntion (61, 67). The early and late phases of Taenia crassiceps infection \nare characterized by Th1-driven M1 and Th2-driven IL-4\u2013mediat-\ned M2 polarization of macrophages, respectively (11, 68). A simi-\nlar M1-M2 switch has been reported during Schistosoma mansoni \nand Trypanosoma congolense infection (69). In the chronic stage of \nT. crassiceps infection, the p50 NF-\u03baB subunit (see above) promotes \nprotective M2 macrophage polarization associated with decreased \nparasite burden (30).\nThe recurrent association of M2 polarization with parasite infec-\ntions does not necessarily imply a generalized relevance in patho-\ngenesis. For instance, lineage-selective ablation of the IL-4\u03b1 chain \ncauses a dramatic increase in susceptibility to S. mansoni, but has \nno discernible effect on Nippostrongylus infection (70).\nViral infections. Polarized activation of macrophages has been \nassociated with virus infection (e.g., HIV, Kaposi sarcoma\u2013associ-\nated herpes virus, and others; see Supplemental References), and \nthis polarization may be important in containing and limiting \ntissue damage. In particular, during severe respiratory syncytial \nvirus\u2013induced (RSV-induced) bronchiolitis, IL-4R\u03b1/STAT6-\ndependent M2 macrophage differentiation reduces inflammation \nand epithelial damage in lungs (71).\nscience in medicine\n790 \nThe Journal of Clinical Investigation\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 http://www.jci.org\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Volume 122\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Number 3\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 March 2012\nAllergy\nAllergy is driven by Th2 cells and products and is associated with \nM2 polarization of macrophages (72, 73). IL-4\u2013inducible che-\nmokines acting on CCR4 (e.g., CCL22) have also been reported \nto promote skewing of macrophage function (74). Evidence now \nindicates that chitin- and arginase-dependent M2 pathways play \nan active role in pathogenesis (75, 76). Asthma is associated with \ntissue remodeling, including collagen deposition and goblet cell \nhyperplasia. IL-4\u2013driven M2 polarization is likely to play a key role \nas an orchestrator of these processes (77).\nAllergy represents a paradigm for IL-4/IL-13\u2013driven type 2 \ninflammation. However, there is evidence that the inflamma-\nsome/IL-1/Th17 pathway can also drive allergic inflammation \n(78, 79). Moreover, a Th1-associated cytokine, IL-18, has also \nbeen implicated in allergic inflammation (80). It is therefore per-\nhaps not surprising that mixed phenotype macrophages have \nbeen observed (81).\nCancer\nCancer-related inflammation is characterized by the recruitment \nof cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage to tumor tissues \n(2, 82, 83), which also condition the premetastatic niche, to \nfavor secondary localization of cancer. Classically activated M1-\npolarized macrophages have the potential to exhibit antitumor \nactivity and to elicit tumor tissue disruption (4). At least in some \nmodels of carcinogenesis in the mouse, progression is associated \nwith a phenotype switch from M1 to M2 (84). Th1-driven mac-\nrophage activation was found to mediate elimination of senes-\ncent hepatocytes, which drive subsequent carcinogenesis (85). \nIt is therefore likely that classically activated M1 macrophages \ncontribute to the T cell\u2013mediated elimination and equilibrium \nphases during tumor progression (86).\nAt later stages of progression in mice and humans, TAMs gener-\nally have an M2-like phenotype with low IL-12 expression, high IL-10 \u2002\nexpression, and low tumoricidal activity and promotion of tissue \nremodeling and angiogenesis. TAM infiltration is generally associ-\nated with poor prognosis, as shown in Hodgkin disease, glioma, chol-\nangiocarcinoma, and breast carcinoma (87, 88). However, TAMs with \nvarious functional states can coexist in the same tumor (2, 89). Vari-\nous pathways orchestrate the protumor function of myelomonocytic \ncells, including tumor-derived and host-derived signals (2). Lympho-\ncytes are key orchestrators of TAM function (2), but pathways differ \nin tumors originating in different organs. For instance, skewing of \nmacrophage function was found to be mediated by IL-4\u2013producing \nTh2 cells in skin (90, 91) and by antibody-producing B cells in breast \ncarcinogenesis (92, 93). B1 cells can promote cancer progression in \nthe skin (5), and fibroblasts can also contribute to circuits driving \nmacrophage polarization and tumor promotion (94).\nTumor cell products, including extracellular matrix compo-\nnents, IL-10, CSF-1, and chemokines (CCL2, CCL18, CCL17, and \nCXCL4), set macrophages in an M2-like, cancer-promoting mode \n(82, 95\u201397). TAMs can also interact with and promote the tumori-\ngenicity of cancer stem cells (CSCs) via production of the milk-fat \nglobule-epidermal growth factor\u2013VIII (MFG-E8) by activation of \nthe STAT3 and sonic hedgehog pathways (98).\nThe identification of the various cellular and molecular path-\nways that participate in inflammation in different human cancers \nwill be required to translate our understanding of cancer-related \ninflammation to meaningful therapeutic advances.\nObesity and metabolism\nObesity-associated insulin resistance, diabetes, and metabolic \nsyndrome are sustained by chronic subclinical inflammation \n(99). Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are a major component \nTable 1\nPrototypic therapeutic strategies targeting macrophage polarization\nFunction \nTherapeutic agent \nDisease\nRecruitment\t\nAnti\u2013CSF-1 (Ab and antisense-ODN)\t\nBreast cancer\n\t\nAnti-CCL2 (Ab)\t\nBreast, prostate cancer\n\t\nCCL2 inhibitor (bindarit)\t\nMelanoma and vascular pathology\n\t\nfms-tyrosine kinase inhibitors\t\nAcute myeloid leukemia and bone metastasis\nDepletion\t\nTrabectedin\t\nLiposarcoma\nSwitch to M1\t\nIFN-\u03b3\t\nAtopic dermatitis; ovarian cancer\n\t\nTLR9 agonist (CpG-ODN)\t\nAsthma\n\t\nCpG-ODN + anti\u2013IL-10\t\nBreast cancer\n\t\nAnti-CD40 (agonist)\t\nPancreatic cancer\n\t\nSTAT3 inhibitors\t\nBreast cancer; melanoma\n\t\nSTAT6 inhibitors\t\nBreast cancer; T. crassiceps (e.s.)\n\t\np50 NF-\u03baB inhibitors\t\nT. congolense; fibrosarcoma, melanoma\n\t\nIKK\u03b2 inhibitors\t\nOvarian cancer\n\t\nImidazoquinolines (TLR7/8 agonists)\t\nSCC, cutaneous B cell lymphomas\n\t\nZoledronic acid\t\nBreast cancer\nInhibition of M1 pathways\t\nCD40 (antagonist)\t\nAtherosclerosis\nInhibition of M2 pathways\t\nIL-33 (antagonist)\t\nAirway inflammation\nInduction of M2 pathways\t\nPPAR\u03b3 agonists (thiazolidinediones)\t\nDiabetes; atherosclerosis\n\t\nNonthiazolidinedione tyrosine-based\t\n\t\nPPAR\u03b3 ligand (GW7845)\t\nAtherosclerosis\n\t\nStatin\t\nGlomerulonephritis\nODN, oligodeoxyribonucleotides; IKK\u03b2, IKK\u03b2 subunit of I\u03baB kinase (IKK); e.s., early stage of infection.

In obese subjects and mice, adipocytes release media-\ntors such as CCL2, TNF, or free fatty acids, which promote the \nrecruitment and activation of ATMs (100\u2013102). In turn, ATM-pro-\nduced inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2) counteract \nthe insulin-sensitizing action of adiponectin and leptin, leading to \ninsulin resistance. ATM infiltration correlates with the degree of \nobesity (101\u2013103). ATM accumulation is orchestrated by selected \nchemokines and their receptors (e.g., CCL2/CCR2 or CCL5/CCR5) \n(101, 103, 104) and by the macrophage-derived apoptosis inhibitor \nof macrophages (AIM) (105).\nATMs from obese mice and humans are polarized toward an \nM1 phenotype, with upregulation of TNF and iNOS. In con-\ntrast \u201clean\u201d ATMs express high levels of M2 genes, including \nIL-10, Ym1, and Arginase 1 (106, 107). Weight loss is associ-\nated with a shift back to an M2-like phenotype. However, evi-\ndence indicates that the ATM population in obese patients is \ndiverse, with a minor F4/80+CD11b+CD11c\u2013, IL-10hi, M2-like \npopulation coexisting with M1 cells (106). Moreover, analysis \nof CD11c+ ATMs from obese mice revealed a mixed profile of \nseveral M1-M2 gene transcripts (108). Weight loss is associ-\nated with an increase in F4/80+CD11c\u2013CD301+ M2-like macro-\nphages, which promote lipolysis (109).\nProgress has been made in defining the molecular pathways that \naccount for polarization of ATMs (19, 20, 24, 110, 111) in obesity. \nMice with macrophage-selective genetic inactivation of PPAR\u03b3, \nPPAR\u03b4, and KLF4 show inhibition of obesity-induced insulin \nresistance (19, 20, 24, 106, 110), although these results may be \nstrain specific (112). The adipose tissue of obese subjects shows a \nmarked reduction in KLF4 levels. Nguyen et al. have recently dem-\nonstrated that adaptation to lower temperatures (thermogenesis) \nis associated with polarization of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and \nwhite adipose tissue (WAT) macrophages to the alternative state \n(M2), with increased expression of thermogenic genes (Ppargc1 \nand Ucp1) (113). In response to cold, IL-4\u2013driven M2 macrophages \nrelease noradrenaline in BAT and WAT, which coordinates fatty \nacid mobilization and energy expenditure (113). Although further \nwork is needed to dissect the diversity and dynamics of ATMs, \u2002\nM2-like cells in nonobese individuals are likely involved in main-\ntaining adipose tissue homeostasis, preventing inflammation, and \npromoting insulin sensitivity. In contrast, M1-like ATMs drive \nobesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance (107). The \nrole of macrophages in obesity and associated disorders underlines \na homeostatic function of macrophages in metabolism as cells \ncapable of reorienting their own metabolic activity and as orches-\ntrators of general metabolism.\nFigure 2\nSchematic representation of macrophage plasticity and polarization in pathology. Dynamic changes occur over time with evolution of pathology: \nfor instance, a switch from M1 to M2 macrophage polarization characterizes the transition from early to chronic phases of infection. Moreover, \nmixed phenotypes or populations with different phenotypes can coexist.

In addition, therapeutic \napproaches not originally designed as macrophage oriented or spe-\ncific have been found to affect macrophage activation and polar-\nization. These off-target examples provide insights and lessons for \nthe development of more specifically directed approaches.\nRecruitment is a key determinant sustaining macrophage \nnumbers at sites of inflammation and immunity. Monocyte \nattractants include members of the chemokine superfamily, \nCCL2/MCP-1 in particular, and growth factors interacting with \ntyrosine kinase receptors CSF-1 and VEGF (83, 114, 115). CSF-1 \nreceptor (c-fms) kinase inhibitors have been generated, and these \nmolecules exhibit antiangiogenic and antimetastatic activity in \nacute myeloid leukemia and melanoma models (116, 117). Che-\nmokines and CSF-1 are more than monocyte attractants; they \nalso promote M2-like skewing of macrophage function (97, \n118, 119). Antibodies directed against CCL2/CCR2 have proven \nactive in prostate and breast cancer (83, 120). A CCL2 inhibitor \n(bindarit) has proven active in preclinical models of cancer and \nvascular pathology, resulting in inhibition of monocyte recruit-\nment (121); this agent is now undergoing evaluation for clinical \nuse. Anti\u2013CSF-1 antibodies and antisense oligonucleotides sup-\npress macrophage infiltration and xenograft mammary tumor \ngrowth in mice (122\u2013124). VEGF inhibitors can decrease macro-\nphage recruitment, and this effect may contribute to their anti-\nangiogenic activity (125). In contrast, in response to neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy, altered composition in the immune microenvi-\nronment was found in breast cancer patients, with increased per-\ncentage of infiltrating myeloid cells (126).\nRecent results suggest that in situ, proliferation is a key deter-\nminant of macrophage accumulation during inflammation in \nthe peritoneum and lungs (127, 128). In the latter, IL-4 was found \nto sustain macrophage proliferation. If proliferation is indeed a \nmajor general mechanism sustaining macrophage accumulation, \nthis may suggest novel approaches to reduce macrophage numbers \nin situ and a different perspective for anti\u2013CSF-1/CSF-1R strate-\ngies. However, determining the actual significance of macrophage \nproliferation in humans, in particular in Th2-mediated inflamma-\ntion, is a major stumbling block in this perspective.\nReorienting and reshaping deranged macrophage polarization \nis the holy grail of macrophage therapeutic targeting (129). Polar-\nized phenotypes are reversible in vitro and in vivo (29, 130\u2013132). \nIn proof of concept and in a large clinical study in ovarian cancer \npatients, IFN-\u03b3 was found to activate TAM tumoricidal activity, \ninducing a phenotype switch with unequivocal evidence of clinical \nresponses (133). In a model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, \nCD40 agonist antibodies promoted a remarkable antitumor effect \nand induced high expression of M1 markers (MHC class II and \nCD86) in macrophages (132).\nModulation of macrophage function is an off-target effect for \na number of diverse therapeutic agents. PPAR\u03b3 agonists (thia-\nzolidinediones) have long been used in the treatment of diabetes. \nThe evidence linking PPAR\u03b3 to M2 polarization and hence to the \nhomeostatic role of ATMs sheds fresh new light on their mode \nof action. Preclinical evidence suggests that PPAR\u03b3 promotes \u2002\nM2-like polarization and homeostatic metabolic function in ATMs \nand that alteration of this function is a key pathogenic feature in \ndiabetes (134\u2013136). Other therapeutic strategies that have been \nreported to affect macrophage polarization include zoledronic \nacid (an agent used for preventing recurrence of breast cancer bone \nmetastasis), statins (137), trabectedin (138) and TLR ligands (e.g., \nimiquimod and CpG) (see also Supplemental References).\nConcluding remarks\nProgress has been made in defining the molecular networks \nunderlying polarized activation of macrophages. Molecular \ndeterminants of M1 versus M2 polarization include members \nof the PPAR, KLF, IRF, STAT, NF-\u03baB, and HIF families. Regu-\nlation of skewing also involves epigenetic modifications with \ninvolvement of histone methylation and acetylation. miRNAs \nhave emerged as regulators of phagocyte activation and function \n(34, 139), but their role in macrophage polarization needs to be \nfurther defined.\nFunctional polarization has now been observed in vivo under \nphysiological and pathological conditions. The former include \nembryogenesis and pregnancy and normal maintenance of select-\ned tissues, such as testis and adipose. The latter include chronic \ninflammation and tissue repair, metabolic and vascular disorders, \ninfection, and cancer. There is now evidence that macrophages are \na key component of all of these processes (Figure 2).\nUnder condition such as parasite infections, allergy, and many \ncancers, the functional phenotypes of macrophages in vivo mirror \nthose of canonical M1-M2 or M2-like polarized states as defined \nin vitro. However, in a number of pathological conditions, such as \nneurodegenerative disorders (140), this is not the case, and macro-\nphage populations express mixed or unique phenotypes. The con-\ntribution of coexisting cells with different phenotypes, the impact \nof dynamic changes during disease evolution, and the molecular \nnetworks orchestrating these mixed phenotypes need to be carefully \ndissected on a case-by-case basis. Indeed, this macrophage plasticity \ncalls for in-depth analysis in different pathological conditions.\nTherapeutic macrophage targeting is in its infancy. Selected \nclinically approved therapeutic strategies, such as use of PPAR\u03b3 \ninhibitors, statins, zolendronic acid, and preventive activities such \nas weight loss may have an impact on the functional status of \nmacrophages; however, the extent to which their effect on mac-\nrophages explains their clinical efficacy remains to be defined. \nThe identification of mechanisms and molecules associated with \nmacrophage plasticity and polarized activation provides a basis for \nmacrophage-centered diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by Associazione Italiana Ricerca sul Can-\ncro (AIRC), Italy; Fondazione Cariplo, Italy; Ministero Universit\u00e0 \nRicerca (MIUR) e Salute; and by the European Commission (ERC \nProject No. 233417 HIIS to AM).\nAddress correspondence to: Antonio Sica, IRCCS Istituto Clinico \nHumanitas, via Manzoni 113, 20089 Rozzano, Milan, Italy.

Synaptic plasticity specifically refers to the\nactivity-dependent modification of the strength or efficacy\nof synaptic transmission at preexisting synapses, and for\nover a century has been proposed to play a central role in\nthe capacity of the brain to incorporate transient experi-\nences into persistent memory traces. Synaptic plasticity is\nalso thought to play key roles in the early development of\nneural circuitry and evidence is accumulating that impair-\nments in synaptic plasticity mechanisms contribute to\nseveral prominent neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, eluci-\ndating the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying\nsynaptic plasticity in any number of different brain regions\nis critical for understanding the neural basis of many\naspects of normal and pathological brain function.\nGiven the diversity of the functions ascribed to synaptic\nplasticity, it is not surprising that many forms and\nmechanisms of synaptic plasticity have been described.\nSynaptic transmission can be either enhanced or depressed\nby activity, and these changes span temporal domains\nranging from milliseconds to hours, days, and presumably\neven longer. Furthermore, virtually all excitatory synapses\nin the mammalian brain simultaneously express a number\nof different forms of synaptic plasticity. Here, we attempt to\nprovide a broad overview of the mechanisms of the most\nprominent\nforms\nof\nplasticity\nobserved\nat\nexcitatory\nsynapses in the mammalian brain. After briefly reviewing\nshort-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity, we will emphasize\ncurrent understanding of the cellular mechanisms and\npossible functions of the class of phenomena commonly\ntermed long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depres-\nsion (LTD).\nSHORT-TERM SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY\nNumerous forms of short-term synaptic plasticity, lasting\non the order of milliseconds to several minutes, have been\nobserved at virtually every synapse examined in organisms\nranging from simple invertebrates to mammals (Zucker and\nRegehr, 2002). These are thought to play important roles in\nshort-term adaptations to sensory inputs, transient changes\nin behavioral states, and short-lasting forms of memory.\nMost forms of short-term synaptic plasticity are triggered\nby short bursts of activity causing a transient accumulation\nof calcium in presynaptic nerve terminals. This increase in\npresynaptic\ncalcium\nin\nturn\ncauses\nchanges\nin\nthe\nprobability of neurotransmitter release by directly modify-\ning the biochemical processes that underlie the exocytosis\nof synaptic vesicles.\nPaired-Pulse Facilitation and Depression\nWhen two stimuli are delivered within a short interval, the\nresponse to the second stimulus can be either enhanced or\nReceived 5 June 2007; revised 1 August 2007; accepted 1 August 2007\n*Correspondence: Dr RC Malenka, Department of Psychiatry, Stanford\nMedical Center, 1201 Welch Rd., Rm.

Paired-pulse\ndepression is commonly observed at all synapses at short\n(less than 20 ms) interstimulus intervals, and most probably\nresults from inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium or\ncalcium channels or from a transient depletion of the\nrelease-ready pool of vesicles docked at the presynaptic\nterminal. Many synapses exhibit paired-pulse facilitation at\nlonger\ninterstimulus\nintervals\n(20\u2013500 ms).\nA\nsimple\nexplanation for this phenomenon is that the residual\ncalcium left over from the invasion of the first action\npotential contributes to additional release during the second\nstimulation, but it is likely that additional mechanisms are\ninvolved. These may involve activation of protein kinases\nthat modulate the activity of presynaptic phosphoproteins.\nFor example, mice in which the presynaptic phosphoprotein\nsynapsin (De Camilli et al, 1990) has been knocked out,\nexhibit abnormal short-term plasticity (Rosahl et al, 1993,\n1995).\nWhether a synapse exhibits paired-pulse facilitation or\ndepression depends on the recent history of activation of\nthe synapse. Because these forms of plasticity largely result\nfrom changes in the probability of transmitter release (p),\nsynapses that begin with a very high p tend to depress their\nresponse to the second pulse (Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997).\nIn contrast, synapses with a low initial p normally exhibit an\nincrease in p in response to the second stimulus. Consistent\nwith this idea, manipulations that decrease p (eg, activation\nof presynaptic autoreceptors) almost always cause an\nincrease in the magnitude of paired-pulse facilitation, or\neven a conversion of paired-pulse depression to facilitation.\nThus, the same synapse can display either facilitation or\ndepression, depending on its recent history of activation\nand modulation.\nFacilitation and Depression Following Trains of\nStimuli\nLonger-lasting forms of plasticity are observed following\nrepetitive or tetanic stimulation of synapses with prolonged\n(approximately 200 ms to 5 s) trains of stimulation applied\nat high frequencies (10\u2013200 Hz) (Zucker and Regehr, 2002).\nAugmentation and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) describe\nan enhancement of transmitter release lasting from seconds\n(augmentation) to several minutes (PTP). They also involve\nan increase in the probability of transmitter release in\nresponse to an action potential due, in large part, to the\nbuildup\nof\ncalcium\nconcentration\nin\nthe\npresynaptic\nterminal during the stimulus trains. This residual calcium\nmay combine with the calcium influx elicited by the\nsubsequent single action potential to enhance directly the\nrelease of neurotransmitter, or may lead to biochemical\nmodifications of proteins in the presynaptic terminal\n(Magleby and Zengel, 1982; Zucker and Regehr, 2002).\nAt some synapses, repetitive activation leads to depres-\nsion that can last for several seconds or even minutes (Betz,\n1970; Zucker and Regehr, 2002). As in paired-pulse\ndepression, this generally occurs in synapses that exhibit a\nhigh probability of release, and is thought to result, at least\nin part, from a transient depletion of the release-ready pool\nof synaptic vesicles. The decrease in synaptic strength can\nalso arise from the release of modulatory substances from\nthe activated presynaptic terminals, postsynaptic cells, or\neven neighboring cells, initiating a signaling cascade that\nleads to inhibition of the presynaptic release machinery.\nFinally, a postsynaptic mechanism of short-term plasticity\nmay involve desensitization of ligand-gated receptors,\nmaking the target neuron less sensitive to neurotransmitter.\nA key characteristic of depression at many synapses is use\ndependence. Higher levels of transmission are associated\nwith larger depression, and reduction of baseline transmis-\nsion (eg, by reducing external calcium concentration)\nrelieves depression.\nModulation of Transmission by Presynaptic\nReceptors\nMost presynaptic terminals possess a number of different\ntypes of metabotropic G-protein-coupled receptors, as well\nas ionotropic receptors (MacDermott et al, 1999). The\nprobability of transmitter release, a significant factor in\ndefining synaptic strength, is controlled in part by the\noccupancy of these receptors, which in turn is set by the\nextracellular concentrations of their agonists. In some cases,\ntonic levels of endogenous ligands are sufficient to partially\nactivate the receptors. Nonetheless, synaptic activity can\nfurther increase receptor occupancy by transiently elevating\nthe concentration of various presynaptic neuromodulators\n(Thompson et al, 1993; Miller, 1998). Depending on their\nspecific properties, activation of these receptors can either\nenhance or depress synaptic transmission.\nVia the release of a number of different neuromodulators,\npostsynaptic\ncells\ncan\nalso\ninfluence\nthe\nrelease\nof\ntransmitter from presynaptic terminals. A common scenar-\nio is that in response to strong postsynaptic depolarization,\ndendrites release retrograde messengers that act through G-\nprotein-coupled receptors located on presynaptic terminals\nto influence neurotransmitter release. Retrograde messen-\ngers that have been identified in specific cell types include\ndopamine, dynorphin, glutamate, GABA, nitric oxide,\nbrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and oxytocin\n(Drake et al, 1994; Kombian et al, 1997; Llano et al, 1991;\nNaggapan and Lu, 2005; Nugent et al, 2007; Pitler and Alger,\n1992; Zilberter, 2000; Zilberter et al, 1999). Although\npostsynaptic, calcium-dependent fusion of vesicles is one\ncommon mechanism for the release of retrograde messen-\ngers, they can also released by non-vesicular mechanisms.\nFor example, a widespread, extensively studied system for\nmediating retrograde synaptic signaling involves the post-\nsynaptic release of endogenous cannabinoids, such as\nanandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, which are pro-\nduced upon demand by cleavage of phospholipids and are\nsensed by CB1 receptors on presynaptic terminals. The\nmechanisms of endocannabinoid release are unclear and\nmay involve a transporter, which facilitates diffusion across\nthe plasma membrane (Chevaleyre et al, 2006) Such\nretrograde signaling by postsynaptic release of endocanna-\nbinoids can be initiated by strong depolarization or\nactivation of postsynaptic metabotropic receptors and has\nbeen shown to transiently suppress inhibitory and excita-\ntory synapses in several brain regions (Chevaleyre et al,\n2006). Importantly, in the striatum, there is a form of LTD\n(to be discussed below) that is triggered by the release of\nendocannabinoids.\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n19\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\nInvolvement of Glia in Short-Term Plasticity\nThere is growing realization that glia may be involved in\nsome forms of short-term plasticity (Araque et al, 2001;\nHaydon,\n2001).\nWith\ntheir\nintimate\nassociation\nwith\nsynapses, astrocytes and perisynaptic Schwann cells are\nwell\npositioned\nto\nregulate\nsynapses.\nThey\nhave\nan\nestablished role in clearance of neurotransmitter and may\nparticipate in synaptic plasticity by controlling the speed\nand extent of such clearance (Bergles et al, 1999; Danbolt,\n2001). This can in turn impact on the degree of postsynaptic\nreceptor activation and desensitization. Another way that\nglia may be involved in synaptic plasticity is by sensing\nextracellular messengers and then releasing substances that\nin turn can directly affect synaptic efficacy (Araque et al,\n2001; Haydon, 2001). For example, glia express many\ndifferent neurotransmitter receptors (eg, glutamate recep-\ntors), which when activated result in the release of\nsubstances (eg, ATP) that can then act on presynaptic\nterminals to regulate neurotransmitter release.\nFunctions of Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity\nShort-term synaptic plasticity was originally established as\nbehaviorally important from studies of simple organisms\nsuch as Aplysia (Kandel and Tauc, 1965). In the mammalian\nbrain, an important consequence of short-term synaptic\nplasticity\nis\nto\ninfluence\nthe\ninformation\nprocessing\nfunction of synapses, enabling them to act as filters with a\nwide range of properties. For example, synapses with a low\ninitial probability of release function as high-pass filters,\nsince they will facilitate during high-frequency action\npotential bursts while low-frequency bursts will not be\ntransmitted with the same efficacy. In contrast, synapses\nwith a high initial probability of release function as low-pass\nfilters, since they will depress during high-frequency bursts\nbut will reliably relay low-frequency activity (Abbott and\nRegehr, 2004). The filtering characteristics of a synapse can\nbe adjusted through modulation of the initial release\nprobability. This most commonly occurs due to the release\nof neuromodulators that, via activation of presynaptic\nreceptors, reduce the probability of release. This changes\nthe filtering characteristics of the synapse, causing facilita-\ntion to become predominant over depression. In this way,\npresynaptic inhibition can convert a synapse from a low-\npass to a high-pass filter.\nLONG-TERM SYNAPTIC PLASTICIY\nIt is widely believed that experience of any sort modifies\nsubsequent behavior at least in part through activity-\ndependent, long-lasting modifications of synaptic strength.\nThe brain encodes external and internal events as complex,\nspatio-temporal patterns of activity in large ensembles\nof neurons that can be conceptualized as \u2018neural circuits\u2019.\nA key feature defining the behavior of any given neural\ncircuit is the pattern of synaptic weights that connect\nthe individual neurons that comprise the circuit. A corollary\nto this hypothesis is that new information is stored\n(ie, memories are generated) when activity in a circuit\ncauses a long-lasting change in the pattern of synaptic\nweights. This idea was put forward over 100 years ago\nby the Spanish Nobel laureate Santiago Ramon y Cajal,\nand was further advanced in the late 1940s by Donald\nHebb,\nwho\nproposed\nthat\nassociative\nmemories\nare\nformed in the brain by a process of synaptic modification\nthat strengthens connections when presynaptic activity\ncorrelates with postsynaptic firing (Hebb, 1949). This\nproposed\nfunction\nfor\nsynaptic\nplasticity,\nforming\na\nmemory trace following the detection of two coincident\nevents, suggests an appealing cellular basis for behavioral\nphenomena\nsuch\nas\nPavlovian\nclassical\nconditioning\n(Pavlov, 1927).\nExperimental support for the very existence of such\nlong-lasting,\nactivity-dependent\nchanges\nin\nsynaptic\nstrength was lacking until the early 1970s when Bliss\nand colleagues (Bliss and Gardner-Medwin, 1973; Bliss\nand Lomo, 1973) reported that repetitive activation of\nexcitatory synapses in the hippocampus caused a potentia-\ntion of synaptic strength that could last for hours or even\ndays. Over the last three decades, this phenomenon,\neventually termed LTP, has been the object of intense\ninvestigation because it is widely believed that it provides an\nimportant key to understanding some of the cellular and\nmolecular mechanisms by which memories are formed\n(Martin et al, 2000; Pastalkova et al, 2006; Whitlock et al,\n2006).\nAlthough still considered prototypic, it is now clear that\nhippocampal LTP is only one of several different forms of\nlong-term synaptic plasticity that exist in specific circuits in\nthe mammalian brain. Importantly, it is well established\nthat most synapses that exhibit LTP also express one or\nmore forms of LTD. Thus, a key concept is that synaptic\nstrength at excitatory synapses is bidirectionally modifiable\nby different patterns of activity. Furthermore, it is now clear\nthat the terms \u2018LTP\u2019 and \u2018LTD\u2019 describe a class of\nphenomena, the underlying mechanisms of which vary\ndepending on the circuits in which they function.\nAdditional forms of synaptic plasticity more recently\nidentified\ninclude\nhomeostatic\nplasticity\n(Turrigiano\nand\nNelson,\n2004) and\nmetaplasticity\n(Abraham\nand\nBear, 1996). The major form of homeostatic plasticity is\n\u2018synaptic scaling\u2019, which describes phenomena whereby\nthe strength of all synapses on a given cell are adjusted in\nresponse to prolonged changes in activity. Specifically,\nprolonged decreases in overall activity cause a net scaling\nup of total synaptic strengths while prolonged increases in\nactivity cause the opposite, a scaling down of synaptic\nstrengths. This form of plasticity operates on a much\nslower timescale than LTP or LTD and may be parti-\ncularly\nimportant\nduring\nthe\ndevelopment\nof\nneural\ncircuits. Metaplasticity refers to the effects that activity\ncan have on the capacity of synapses to express long-term\nplasticity.\nThe most extensively studied and therefore prototypic\nforms of synaptic plasticity are the LTP and LTD observed\nin the CA1 region of the hippocampus (Figure 1), which are\ntriggered by activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)\nreceptors (NMDARs). We will therefore begin with a\ndiscussion of their underlying mechanisms. We will then\nproceed to reviewing some of the other prominent forms of\nLTP and LTD for which mechanisms have been most firmly\nestablished.\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n20\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\nNMDAR-Dependent LTP\nNo form of plasticity has generated more interest, or been\nmore extensively studied than LTP in the CA1 region of the\nhippocampus. The excitement surrounding this phenom-\nenon is due to compelling evidence from rodents, primates,\nand humans associating the hippocampus with a neural\nsystem involved in various forms of long-term memory\n(Martin et al, 2000; Zola-Morgan and Squire, 1993).\nFurthermore, several basic properties of LTP make it an\nattractive cellular mechanism for rapid information storage.\nSimilar to memory, LTP can be generated rapidly and is\nstrengthened and prolonged by repetition. It also exhibits\ncooperativity, associativity, and input specificity. (Nicoll\net al, 1988). Cooperativity means that LTP can be induced\nby the coincident activation of a critical number of\nsynapses. Associativity is the capacity to potentiate a weak\ninput (a small number of synapses) when it is activated in\nassociation with a strong input (a larger number of\nsynapses). As such, associativity is a cellular analogue of\nclassical conditioning and is an implicit property of the so-\ncalled Hebbian synapse. Input specificity indicates that LTP\nis elicited only at activated synapses and not at adjacent,\ninactive synapses on the same postsynaptic cell. This feature\ndramatically increases the storage capacity of individual\nneurons since different synapses on the same cell can be\ninvolved in separate circuits encoding different bits of\ninformation.\nA major technological advance in the study of synaptic\nplasticity was the development of the hippocampal slice\npreparation that made LTP accessible to rigorous experi-\nmental analysis (Figure 1b). Indeed, the bulk of our\nknowledge on the molecular mechanisms of LTP has been\nderived from studies of LTP at excitatory synapses on CA1\npyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices. Similar or\nidentical forms of LTP have been observed at excitatory\nsynapses throughout the brain. Thus, the conclusions drawn\nfrom the study of LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region are\noften applied to other brain regions.\nTriggering NMDAR-dependent LTP. A major advance in\nthe understanding of excitatory synaptic function and LTP\nwas the demonstration that two major types of ionotropic\nglutamate receptors contribute to the postsynaptic response\nat glutamatergic synapses, a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-\nisoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors (AMPARs) and\nNMDARs (Figure 1c). These receptors are often (although\nnot always, as will be elaborated upon later) found\nAMPAR\nNMDAR\nMg2+\nMg2+\nNa+\nCa2+\nNa+\nNa+\nDepolarization\n2\n2\n1\n0\n10 20 30 40 50\n0\n10 20 30 40 50\n50\n100\n150\n200\nTime (min)\nTime (min)\nLTP\nLTD\nfEPSP slope (%)\n1\n2\n1\n50\n100\n150\n200\nRec\nCA1\nStim\nCA3\nSC\nDG\nMF\nFigure 1\nNMDAR-dependent LTP and LTD at hippocampal CA1 synapses.

(c) Model of synaptic transmission at excitatory synapses. During basal synaptic transmission (left panel), synaptically released glutamate binds\nboth the NMDA and AMPARs. Na + flows through the AMPAR channel but not through the NMDAR channel because of the Mg2 + block of this channel.\nDepolarization of the postsynaptic cell (right) relieves the Mg2 + block of the NMDAR channel and allows both Na + and Ca2 + to flow into the dendritic\nspine. The resultant increase in Ca2 + in the dendritic spine is necessary for triggering the subsequent events that drive synaptic plasticity.\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n21\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\ncolocalized on individual dendritic spines. The AMPAR has\na channel that is permeable to monovalent cations (Na +\nand K +), and activation of AMPARs provides most of the\ninward current that generates the excitatory synaptic\nresponse when the cell is close to its resting membrane\npotential. In contrast to AMPARs, the NMDAR exhibits a\nstrong voltage dependence because of the block of its\nchannel at negative membrane potentials by extracellular\nmagnesium (Mayer et al, 1984; Nowak et al, 1984). As a\nresult,\nNMDARs\ncontribute\nlittle\nto\nthe\npostsynaptic\nresponse during basal synaptic activity. However, when\nthe cell is depolarized, magnesium dissociates from its\nbinding site within the NMDAR channel, allowing ions to\nenter the cell. Importantly, unlike AMPAR channels, the\nNMDAR channel allows calcium as well as sodium to enter\nthe postsynaptic dendritic spine (Figure 1c).\nIt is firmly established that the triggering (also termed the\ninduction) of LTP in the CA1 region requires activation of\nNMDARs during strong postsynaptic depolarization leading\nto\na\nincrease\nin\npostsynaptic\ncalcium\nconcentration,\nwhich likely has to reach some critical threshold value to\nactivate the biochemical processes necessary for LTP\n(Malenka, 1991; Malenka and Nicoll, 1993). Experimentally,\nthis is normally achieved by applying high-frequency\ntetanic stimulation to the synapses or by use of a \u2018pairing-\nprotocol\u2019 during which the postsynaptic cell is directly\ndepolarized while low-frequency synaptic activation is\nsustained. An additional method for induction of LTP (as\nwell as LTD) involves protocols that generate so-called\n\u2018spike-time dependent plasticity\u2019 (STDP; Dan and Poo, 2006;\nMarkram et al, 1997). In studies of STDP, LTP is induced\nif afferent stimulation generates a synaptic response within\na\ndiscrete\ntime\nwindow\nprior\nto\nthe\nfiring\nof\nthe\npostsynaptic cell.\nBecause its contribution to postsynaptic reponses re-\nquires both presynaptic release of glutamate and post-\nsynaptic depolarization due to the simultaneous activation\nof a population of synapses, the NMDAR is often referred to\nas a \u2018coincidence detector\u2019. These properties of NMDARs\nalso explain the basic properties of LTP. Cooperativity and\nassociativity occur because of the requirement for multiple\nsynapses\nto\nbe\nactivated\nsimultaneously\nto\ngenerate\nadequate postsynaptic depolarization to remove the mag-\nnesium block of the NMDAR. Input specificity is due to the\ncompartmentalized increase in calcium, which is limited to\nthe postsynaptic dendritic spine and does not influence\nadjacent spines (Nicoll et al, 1988).\nLTP\nsignal\ntransduction\nmechanisms.\nAn\nextensive\nnumber\nof\nsignal\ntransduction\nmolecules\nhave\nbeen\nsuggested to play a role in translating the calcium signal\nthat is required to trigger LTP into the long-lasting increase\nin synaptic strength (Malenka and Bear, 2004; Sanes and\nLichtman, 1999). However, only for a handful of these has\ncompelling evidence of a mandatory role in LTP been\npresented. A major limitation of much of the literature on\nthis topic stems from inadequate distinctions between\nmolecules that are key components of the molecular\nmachinery directly responsible for the triggering of LTP\n(\u2018mediators\u2019), and those molecules which may modulate\nthe ability to generate LTP, or play a permissive role\n(\u2018modulators\u2019). Some basic criteria that can be suggested for\ndefining the role of a protein as a mediator of LTP induction\nare: (1) blocking the activation of the molecule during LTP\ninduction blocks LTP; and (2) activation of the molecule\ninduces a potentiation of synaptic transmission, which\noccludes further synaptic induction of LTP.\nStrong\nevidence\nindicates\nthat\ncalcium/calmodulin\n(CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) fulfills these\nrequirements and is a key component of the molecular\nmachinery for LTP. CaMKII undergoes autophosphoryla-\ntion after the triggering of LTP (Barria et al, 1997; Fukunaga\net al, 1995), and LTP induction was prevented both in\nknockout mice lacking a critical CaMKII subunit (Silva\net al, 1992), and in knock-in animals in which endogenous\nCaMKII was replaced with a form lacking the autopho-\nsphorylation site (Giese et al, 1998). Furthermore, inhibition\nof CaMKII activity by directly loading postsynaptic cells\nwith peptides that impair CaMKII function blocks LTP\n(Malenka et al, 1989; Malinow et al, 1989), whereas acutely\nincreasing the postsynaptic concentration of active CaMKII\nincreases synaptic strength and occludes LTP (Lledo et al,\n1995; Pettit et al, 1994).\nSeveral other kinases have been implicated in the\ntriggering of LTP, but the experimental evidence supporting\ntheir role is not as well substantiated as that for CaMKII.\nActivation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-depen-\ndent protein kinase (PKA), perhaps by the activation of a\ncalmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase, has been suggested\nto boost the activity of CaMKII indirectly by decreasing\ncompeting protein phosphatase activity (Blitzer et al, 1998;\nLisman, 1989; Makhinson et al, 1999). This presumably\nhappens by phosphorylation of inhibitor 1, an endogenous\ninhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). The extracellular\nsignal-regulated\nkinase\n(Erk)/mitogen-activated\nprotein\nkinase (MAPK) pathway has also been suggested to be\nimportant for LTP, as well as some forms of learning and\nmemory (Sweatt, 2004; Thomas and Huganir, 2004). In\naddition, Src kinase has been implicated in the enhance-\nment of NMDAR function during LTP induction (Kalia\net al, 2004). Finally, protein kinase C and in particular the\natypical\nPKC\nisozyme,\nPKMz,\nhas\nreceived\nattention\nbecause this isozyme is rapidly expressed upon induction\nof LTP and recent studies have implicated PKMz in the\nmaintenance of the late phase of LTP both in hippocampal\nslices and in vivo (Hrabetova and Sacktor, 1996; Ling et al,\n2002; Pastalkova et al, 2006; Serrano et al, 2005).\nObviously, it remains a very challenging task to be able to\ndefinitively identify the key intracellular signaling cascades\nresponsible for the triggering of LTP. Recent technical\nadvances in mass spectrometric techniques for the profiling\nof post-transcriptional modifications in mixed populations\nof proteins, as well as the practicality of RNAi approaches\nfor knockdown of candidate proteins, should help further\ncharacterize the major LTP players and their dynamic\ninterplay.\nExpression mechanisms of LTP. In the past, a major point\nof contention was whether LTP was primarily expressed\npostsynaptically as a change in AMPAR properties or\npresynaptically, as a change in the probability of transmitter\nrelease. This latter expression mechanism garnered sig-\nnificant attention because it required the production of a\nretrograde messenger that was released by postsynaptic\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n22\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\ncells and acted on presynaptic terminals (for a thorough\nreview of the evidence for either locus of expression, see\nNicoll, 2003). To a large extent, this controversy has been\nresolved, with the emerging consensus that the major\nmechanism of expression of LTP at hippocampal CA1\nsynapses involves an increase in the numbers of AMPARs\nwithin the postsynaptic density, driven through activity-\ndependent changes in AMPAR trafficking (Bredt and Nicoll,\n2003; Derkach et al, 2007; Malenka and Nicoll, 1999;\nMalinow and Malenka, 2002; Song and Huganir, 2002).\nA major contribution to ending the controversy was the\nproposal of the silent synapse hypothesis and the evidence\nsupporting it (Durand et al, 1996; Isaac et al, 1995; Liao\net al, 1995; Malenka and Nicoll, 1997). Silent synapses are\nsynapses that contain only NMDARs with few or no\nAMPARs, such that at normal resting membrane potentials\nthese synapses exhibit no detectable postsynaptic responses\nto synaptically released glutamate. The \u2018unsilencing\u2019 of these\nsynapses during the induction of LTP is thought to occur\nthrough the incorporation of AMPARs into the postsynaptic\nplasma membrane. This hypothesis was quickly expanded\nto include synapses that already contained AMPARs and\nhas led to a large investigative effort into the molecular\nmechanisms regulating the trafficking of AMPARs (Bredt\nand Nicoll, 2003; Collingridge et al, 2004; Malinow and\nMalenka, 2002; Sheng and Kim, 2002; Song and Huganir,\n2002).\nMost\nAMPARs\nin\nthe\ncentral\nnervous\nsystem\nare\ntetramers comprised of four glutamate receptor subunits,\nGluR1\u2013GluR4. Although these subunits are highly homo-\nlogous, both the functional properties of AMPARs and their\ntrafficking has been suggested to depend on their subunit\ncomposition (Collingridge et al, 2004; Derkach et al, 2007;\nMalinow and Malenka, 2002). In the adult hippocampus,\ntwo forms of AMPARs are thought to predominate: GluR1/\nGluR2 heteromers and GluR2/GluR3 heteromers (Wenthold\net al, 1996). Based on clever overexpression studies, one\nprominent hypothesis suggests that subunit-specific rules\ngovern the synaptic delivery of AMPARs (Hayashi et al,\n2000; Passafaro et al, 2001; Shi et al, 2001). Specifically, it\nhas been suggested that the insertion of GluR1-containing\nAMPARs into synapses is slow under basal conditions and\nis strongly stimulated by NMDAR activation, whereas\ninsertion of GluR2/3 heteromeric receptors may occur\nconstitutively on a much more rapid timescale.\nWhere do these new AMPARs come from and how is their\ntrafficking regulated at a molecular level? Current evidence\nsuggests that recycling endosomes in the dendrites contain\na reserve pool of AMPARs that are mobilized during LTP\nvia a process that requires the small GTP-binding protein,\nRab11a (Park et al, 2004) (Figure 2). Surprisingly, AMPARs\ndo not appear to be inserted directly into the postsynaptic\ndensity (PSD) but rather are exocytosed at perisynaptic\nsites. They then can laterally diffuse in the plasma\nmembrane and be trapped within the PSD due to their\ninteractions with so-called \u2018slot proteins\u2019, which function to\ntrap AMPARs and greatly reduce their lateral mobility.\nAttractive candidates for these slot proteins are a family of\nproteins found in the PSD termed MAGUKs (for mem-\nbrane-associated guanylate kinases). MAGUKS are defined\nby\ntheir\nmultiple\nprotein\ninteraction\ndomains,\nmost\nimportantly so-called PDZ domains. Prominent members\nof the MAGUK family of PSD proteins include PSD-95,\nSAP97, PSD-93, and SAP102 (Kim and Sheng, 2004;\nMontgomery et al, 2004). PSD-95 has received the most\nattention and its level appears to be particularly important\nfor controlling the number of AMPARs at individual\nsynapses as evidenced by the findings that overexpression\nof PSD-95 increases synaptic strength and occludes LTP\n(Ehrlich and Malinow, 2004; Stein et al, 2003), whereas\nknockdown of PSD-95 decreases surface expression of\nAMPARs and synaptic strength (Ehrlich et al, 2007; Schluter\net al, 2006).\nThe influence of PSD-95, as well as other MAGUKS (Elias\net al, 2006; Futai et al, 2007; Schluter et al, 2006), on\nAMPARs was surprising given that PSD-95 was originally\nisolated because of its strong interaction with NMDARs\n(Kornau et al, 1995). Another major surprise was that\nAMPARs do not directly bind to MAGUKs but rather do so\nvia a family of AMPAR auxiliary subunits termed trans-\nmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs). TARPs\nare required for the delivery of AMPARs to the plasma\nmembrane at extrasynaptic sites (Chen et al, 2000; Nicoll\net al, 2006) and also influence their biophysical properties\n(Tomita et al, 2005a). Importantly, they are also required\nfor the synaptic localization of AMPARs due to their direct\ninteraction with MAGUKs (Schnell et al, 2002).\nThe detailed molecular mechanisms by which activation\nof protein kinases such as CaMKII lead to the synaptic\ndelivery of AMPARs remains to be determined. Phosphor-\nylation of AMPAR subunits themselves by CaMKII does not\nappear critical (Esteban et al, 2003; Lee et al, 2003) although\nother phosphorylation sites, such as the PKA or the PKC\nsites on GluR1, may be important (Boehm et al, 2006;\nEsteban et al, 2003). On the other hand, there is reasonable\nevidence that phosphorylation of TARPs occurs following\nCAMKII activation (Tsui and Malenka, 2006) and that this\nmay be critical for LTP (Tomita et al, 2005b). It is, however,\nhighly likely that AMPARs and TARPs are just a component\nof a large complex of proteins, the phosphorylation of which\nwill be required for LTP expression.\nLTP also appears to involve a phosphorylation-driven\nincrease in the single-channel conductance of AMPARs\nthemselves (Benke et al, 1998; Soderling and Derkach,\n2000). Indeed, CaMKII phosphorylates Ser831 in the\nintracellular C terminus of GluR1, resulting in a significant\nincrease in single-channel conductance of homomeric\nGluR1 receptors (Derkach et al, 1999, 2007). However, one\nimportant caveat of this conclusion is that synaptic GluR1-\ncontaining AMPARs also contain GluR2, and in GluR1/2\nheteromeric AMPARs, the enhanced conductance upon\nphosphorylation by CaMKII is absent (Oh and Derkach,\n2005).\nAlthough the evidence to date suggests a more prominent\nrole for AMPAR exocytosis, the relative contribution of\nAMPAR trafficking and changes in the biophysical proper-\nties of AMPARs to the increase in synaptic strength during\nLTP are not well defined. One model for the successive\nevents occurring during the first hour of LTP involves\nactivation of calcium-dependent signal transduction path-\nways, notably CaMKII, resulting in phosphorylation of\nGluR1-containing receptors and an increase in their single-\nchannel conductance. Roughly simultaneously, AMPARs\nare translocated into the PSD via exocytosis and lateral\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n23\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\nmovement within the plasma membrane. Most investigators\nbelieve that the incorporation of AMPARs into the PSD is\nthe more important change because it appears to be\naccompanied by structural changes in the dendritic spines\nand synapses themselves, an attractive mechanism for\nmaintaining LTP (see below). There are also experimental\nfindings consistent with rapid presynaptic changes during\nLTP, but the retrograde messenger that is responsible\nremains elusive, one prominent possibility being BDNF\n(Bramham and Messaoudi, 2005).\nMaintaining\nLTP.\nMuch\nof\nthe\nwork\non\nNMDAR-\ndependent LTP has focused on the mechanisms responsible\nfor its initial 30\u201360 min, to a large extent because of\ntechnical limitations in the duration over which stable\nelectrophysiological recordings can be maintained. None-\ntheless, the mechanisms that allow LTP to persist for hours,\ndays, or even longer are of great importance. Like virtually\nall cell biological phenomena, the persistence of LTP is\ndependent upon new protein synthesis (Reymann and Frey,\n2007). This so-called \u2018late phase of LTP\u2019 (defined as the\npotentiation present more than 1\u20132 h after LTP induction)\nis commonly assumed to depend upon local dendritic\nprotein synthesis, which supplies needed components to the\nsynapse (Sutton and Schuman, 2006), as well as transcrip-\ntion in the nucleus (Zhou et al, 2006). The signaling to the\nnucleus required for long-lasting LTP has been suggested to\ndepend on a number of protein kinases including PKA,\nCaMKIV, and Erk-MAPK, which activate key transcription\nfactors that may include cAMP response element-binding\nprotein and immediate-early genes such as c-Fos and\nZif268/Egr-1 (Thomas and Huganir, 2004). These transcrip-\ntional\ncomplexes\npresumably\npromote\nexpression\nof\neffector genes that are required for maintaining the synaptic\nenhancement.\nSeveral mRNAs can be found in dendrites, including\nthose of the AMPARs themselves, CaMKII, Arc, and\nproteins which may function to regulate receptor trafficking\n(Grooms et al, 2006; Job and Eberwine, 2001; Ju et al, 2004;\nMayford et al, 1996; Schuman et al, 2006; Steward and\nSchuman, 2001). The trafficking of some of these mRNAs\nand their local translation seems to be highly regulated by\nactivity. Furthermore, other components of the translational\nmachinery are found in or adjacent to dendritic spines and\npolyribosomes are recruited to spine heads following LTP\ninduction (Bourne et al, 2007). Thus, there is accumulating\nevidence that the machinery to provide local, newly\nsynthesized proteins to synapses is available.\nAn intriguing hypothesis is that during the synaptic\nactivation to induce LTP a \u2018synaptic tag\u2019 is generated that\nfunctions to capture or sequester plasticity related proteins,\nwhich in turn are required to stabilize the increase in\nsynaptic strength (Frey and Morris, 1997). However, little is\nknown about the identity of the synaptic tag or the newly\nsynthesized proteins that are required to maintain LTP,\nalthough it has been suggested that PKA, CAMKII, or PKMz\nmight function as the synaptic tag (Reymann and Frey,\n2007; Sajikumar et al, 2005; Young et al, 2006).\nA compelling possibility for a long-term maintenance\nmechanism\nof\nLTP\nis\nthe\nstructural\nremodeling\nof\nAMPAR\nNMDAR\nEndocytosis\nRecycling\nExocytosis\nAMPAR\nNMDAR\nAMPAR\nNMDAR\nCa2+\nCaMKII\nCa2+\nCalcineurin \nPP1\nLTP\nLTD\nRab11a\nFigure 2\nModel of AMPAR trafficking during LTP and LTD. In the basal state (depicted on top), receptors cycle between the postsynaptic membrane and\nintracellular compartments. This is achieved through lateral mobility of the receptors out of the synapse into endocytic zones, where they are endocytosed\ninto early endosomes in a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent manner. Normally, the receptors are transferred to recycling endosomes and returned to the\nplasma membrane by exocytosis, followed by lateral movement into the synapse where they are retained through interaction with MAGUKs. Following\ninduction of LTP, there is enhanced receptor exocytosis and stabilization at the synapse through a calcium-driven process that involves CAMKII and fusion of\nrecycling endosomes mediated by Rab11a. Following the induction of LTD, enhanced endocytosis at extrasynaptic sites occurs in a process that is calcium-\ndependent and involves protein phosphatases, primarily calcineurin and protein phosphatases 1 (PP1). While in the basal state endocytosis is presumably\nbalanced by receptor recycling, following LTD receptors are retained within the cell, and perhaps degraded.\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n24\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\npotentiated synapses (Luscher et al, 2000). Spines come in a\nvariety of shapes and sizes, and can undergo rapid shape\nchanges\nthat\nare\ninfluenced\nby\nactivity\n(Yuste\nand\nBonhoeffer, 2001). Morphological changes which have been\nreported\nto\naccompany LTP\ninclude\ngrowth\nof new\ndendritic spines, enlargement of preexisiting spines and\ntheir PSDs, and the splitting of single PSDs and spines into\ntwo functional synapses (Abraham and Williams, 2003;\nMatsuzaki et al, 2004; Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2001). An\nattractive\nmodel\nsuggests\nthat\nduring\nLTP,\nrecycling\nendosomes contribute AMPAR subunits to the synapse, as\nwell as lipids and constituents which enlarge the synapse\n(Lisman and Zhabotinsky, 2001; Luscher et al, 2000; Park\net al, 2004, 2006). At some later time point, there is likely a\nconcomitant increase in the presynaptic active zone, the size\nof which always closely matches that of the PSD (Lisman\nand Harris, 1993). This presynaptic re-modeling must\ninvolve post- and presynaptic protein interactions with\nlikely candidates being cell adhesion molecules such as the\ncadherins or neuroligin/neurexin interactions.\nSummary. The current view of the mechanisms underlying\nthis form of LTP can be summarized as follows (Figure 2). A\nlarge\nNMDAR-dependent\nincrease\nin\ndendritic\nspine\ncalcium concentrations leads to activation of intracellular\nsignaling cascades involving a number of protein kinases,\nmost importantly CaMKII. This leads to an increase in the\nsingle-channel conductance of synaptic AMPARs and more\nimportantly, promotes the incorporation of additional\nAMPARs into the PSD. The new synaptic AMPARs are\nstabilized through their TARP-mediated interaction with\nPDZ domain-containing proteins such as PSD-95. In\nparallel, structural changes within the synapse occur, such\nthat the size of the PSD and dendritic spine are increased.\nThis in turn drives an increase in the size of the presynaptic\nactive\nzone\nsuch\nthat\nthe\npotentiated\nsynapses\nare\n\u2018permanently\u2019 enlarged. The maintenance of these changes\nfor more than a few hours depends on de novo transcription\nas well as local dendritic protein synthesis, presumbably to\nprovide the synapses with a supply of the critical proteins\nnecessary for maintaining synaptic strength.\nNMDAR-Dependent LTD\nAn important advance in the study of long-term synaptic\nplasticity was the establishment of an experimentally\nreproducible form of NMDAR-dependent LTD at excitatory\nsynapses on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (Dudek and\nBear, 1992). This demonstrated that activity could bi-\ndirectionally control synaptic strength (Mulkey and Malenka,\n1992), thus providing support for the idea that memories or\nexperiences were encoded by the distribution of synaptic\nweights in neural circuits, not simply by LTP. Shortly\nthereafter,\na\nsimilar\nform\nof\nLTD\nwas\nobserved\nat\nneocortical synapses (Kirkwood et al, 1993) suggesting that\nmechanistic studies in the hippocampal CA1 region could\nprovide\ninsights\nthat\napplied\nto\nexcitatory\nsynapses\nthroughout the brain. While that remains true to a large\nextent, we now know that in addition to NMDAR-dependent\nLTD, there are several other forms of LTD, which we will\ndiscuss in later sections. Moreover, similar to LTP, evidence\nis accumulating that LTD mechanisms may contribute to a\nlarge number of brain phenomena including experience-\ndependent development, learning and memory, addiction,\nand neurological disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and\nParkinson\u2019s disease (Malenka and Bear, 2004; Brebner et al,\n2005; Kreitzer and Malenka 2007; Hsieh et al, 2006).\nTriggering NMDAR-dependent LTD. The typical protocol\nfor\neliciting\nLTD\ninvolves\nprolonged\nrepetitive\nlow-\nfrequency stimulation (B900 stimuli at 1 Hz; Dudek and\nBear, 1992; Mulkey and Malenka, 1992), although the\nnumber of stimuli can be dramatically reduced and the\nfrequency changed if the postsynaptic neuron is modestly\ndepolarized (to B\u000250 mV), partially relieving the Mg2 +\nblock of the NMDAR (Selig et al, 1995). NMDAR-dependent\nLTD can also be induced by correctly timing the activation\nof presynaptic axons and the postsynaptic neuron (STDP;\n(Dan and Poo, 2006).\nLike LTP, LTD is input-specific and depends upon an\nNMDAR-dependent\nincrease\nin\npostsynaptic\ncalcium\n(Mulkey and Malenka, 1992). The predominant current\nhypothesis is that quantitative properties of the postsynap-\ntic calcium signal within dendritic spines dictates whether\nLTP or LTD is triggered, with LTD requiring a modest\nincrease in calcium (Cummings et al, 1996), whereas LTP\nrequires a increase beyond some critical threshold value\n(Malenka and Nicoll, 1993). The temporal characteristics of\nthe increase in calcium may also be important since\nchanging the relative timing between pre- and postsynaptic\nactivation by just a few tens of milliseconds can reverse the\ndirection of synaptic modification (Dan and Poo, 2006).\nDifferential buffering of postsynaptic calcium levels has\nbeen reported to enable a transition between LTP and LTD\n(Harney et al, 2006; Nishiyama et al, 2000). These findings\ndemonstrate the thin line that lies between synaptic activity\neliciting a potentiation vs a depression and provide support\nto the idea that both LTP and LTD are utilized in parallel for\nencoding experiences in vivo.\nLTD signal transduction mechanisms. An influential\nhypothesis for the signal transduction pathway triggering\nLTD suggested that while LTP was due to the preferential\nactivation of CaMKII, LTD involves activation of a calcium-\ndependent protein phosphatase cascade consisting of the\ncalcium/calmodulin-dependent\nphosphatase\ncalcineurin\n(also known as protein phosphatase 2B), PP1, and a\nphosphoprotein termed inhibitor-1 which functions to\ninhibit PP1 until it is dephosphorylated by calcineurin\n(Lisman, 1989). Consistent with this hypothesis, postsynap-\ntic inhibition of these phosphatases prevents LTD (Kirk-\nwood and Bear, 1994; Morishita et al, 2001; Mulkey et al,\n1994, 1993), whereas directly loading CA1 pyramidal cells\nwith PP1 enhances LTD (Morishita et al, 2001). Although\nsignaling proteins other than phosphatases have been\nsuggested to play key roles in LTD (Bolshakov et al, 2000;\nDan and Poo, 2006; Palmer et al, 2005; Peineau et al, 2007),\nthe hypothesis that LTP involves preferential activation of\nprotein kinases while LTD involves activation of phospha-\ntases remains predominant.\nLTD has been found to correlate with dephosphorylation\nof\npostsynaptic\nPKC\nand\nPKA\nsubstrates\nwithout\na\ndetectable change in CaMKII substrate phosphorylation\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n25\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\n(Hrabetova and Sacktor, 1996; Kameyama et al, 1998; Lee\net al, 2000, 1998. The evidence in support of a role for\ndephosphorylation\nof\nPKA\nsubstrates\nduring\nLTD\nis\nparticularly convincing, as postsynaptic inhibition of PKA,\nor its displacement from intracellular anchoring proteins,\ncause a rundown of synaptic transmission that occludes\nLTD. The mechanism underlying specific dephosphoryla-\ntion of PKA substrates during LTD could involve the\nNMDAR-dependent recruitment of PP1 to synapses (Mor-\nishita et al, 2001) or the selective loss of PKA from synapses\n(Gomez et al, 2002; Snyder et al, 2005). Consistent with a\nrole for PKA, LTD is associated with selective depho-\nsphorylation of Ser845 on GluR1, a PKA substrate site (Lee\net al, 2000). This dephosphorylation event may contribute\nto the expression of LTD, as it decreases the AMPAR open-\nchannel probability (Banke et al, 2000), and mice with\nknock-in alanine substitution of both Ser845 and Ser831 (a\nCaMKII-substrate site) exhibit impaired NMDAR-depen-\ndent LTD (Lee et al, 2003).\nExpression mechanisms of LTD. The demonstration of\nsilent synapses and their conversion to functional synapses\nduring LTP by the incorporation of AMPARs (Malenka and\nNicoll, 1997) immediately gave credence to the idea that the\nopposite might happen during LTD, that is, the removal or\nendocytosis of AMPARs. Consistent with this idea, it was\ndemonstrated that pharmacological manipulations of activ-\nity in cultured neurons (Carroll et al, 1999; Lissin et al,\n1998) or application of glutamate receptor agonists (Beattie\net al, 2000; Carroll et al, 1999; Ehlers, 2000; Heynen et al,\n2000; Lin et al, 2000; Lissin et al, 1998) could cause a loss of\nAMPARs from synapses due to dynamin- and clathrin-\ndependent endocytosis (Carroll et al, 2001; Collingridge\net al, 2004; Derkach et al, 2007; Malinow and Malenka,\n2002). Furthermore, postsynaptic inhibition of dynamin\nactivity impaired LTD in CA1 pyramidal cells in slices (Lee\net al, 2002; Luscher et al, 1999; Morishita et al, 2005). Based\nin large part on these sorts of observations, the current\nleading hypothesis is that the expression mechanism of\nNMDAR-dependent LTD is due to activity-dependent\nendocytosis of synaptic AMPARs (Bredt and Nicoll, 2003;\nCollingridge et al, 2004; Derkach et al, 2007; Malenka and\nBear, 2004; Malinow and Malenka, 2002) (Figure 2).\nThe precise molecular mechanisms by which endocytosis\nof AMPARs occurs during LTD is still not clear but one\nlikely scenario is that it involves dissociation of AMPARs\nfrom their anchors within the PSD, followed by lateral\nmovement to the edge of the PSD where they undergo\nclathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis (Ashby et al,\n2004; Blanpied et al, 2002; Groc et al, 2004). Consistent with\na key role for protein phosphatases, the endocytosis of\nAMPARs is regulated by calcium-dependent dephosphor-\nylation (Beattie et al, 2000; Carroll et al, 2001; Ehlers, 2000).\nKey substrates for facilitating endocytosis may include\ncomponents of the endocytic machinery (Carroll et al, 2001;\nLai et al, 1999; Slepnev et al, 1998) as well as AMPAR\nsubunits themselves (Ehlers, 2000). Following endocytosis,\nAMPARs exhibit increased colocalization with the clathrin\nadaptor protein AP2 (Carroll et al, 1999), an interaction that\nmay be promoted by the Ca2 +-dependent adaptor protein\nhippocalcin (Palmer et al, 2005).\nConsistent with a role for \u2018slot proteins\u2019 in the regulation\nof AMPAR surface levels, LTD has been reported to depend\non PP1-dependent dephosphorylation of stargazin (Tomita\net al, 2005b). This dephosphorylation might permit the\ndissociation of stargazin from PSD-95 and its diffusion out\nof the PSD, enabling LTD through loss of synaptic AMPARs\n(Ziff, 2007). Ubiquitination (Colledge et al, 2003) or\ndepalmitoylation (El-Husseini et al, 2002) of PSD-95 has\nalso been suggested to be critical for agonist-induced\nendocytosis of AMPARs but whether these events are\nrequired for synaptically induced LTD has not been\ndetermined. Additional proteins implicated in AMPAR\nendocytosis include the AMPAR interacting protein PICK1\n(Hanley and Henley, 2005; Kim et al, 2001), the small\nGTPases Rap1 (Zhu et al, 2002, 2005) and Rab5 (Brown\net al, 2005), and a protein termed cpg2 (Cottrell et al, 2004).\nIt has been suggested that particular AMPAR subunits,\nspecifically GluR2, may be especially important for the\nendocytosis of AMPARs during LTD, in part because of its\ndirect interaction with AP2 (Lee et al, 2002). One key\nfinding consistent with this hypothesis is that peptides that\nselectively interfere with this interaction have been reported\nto inhibit LTD (Lee et al, 2002). However, AP2 can bind\nother AMPAR subunits (Kastning et al, 2007; Lee et al,\n2002) and LTD is still observed in hippocampal slices\nobtained from mice lacking GluR2 as well as GluR2 and\nGluR3 (Jia et al, 1996; Meng et al, 2003). Thus, the\nimportance of specific AMPAR subunits for LTD is not\nfirmly established.\nSummary. A current simplified view of the mechanisms\nunderlying NMDAR-dependent LTD can be summarized as\nfollows (Figure 2): a modest increase in postsynaptic\ncalcium concentration within dendritic spines due to\nmodest activation of NMDARs leads to preferential activa-\ntion of protein phosphatases (as well as a few other key\nsignaling proteins). This leads to the dissociation of\nAMPARs from their molecular scaffolds in the PSD and\ntheir lateral movement to endocytic zones on the periphery\nof the PSD, where they are endocytosed and potentially\ndegraded. We have not discussed the maintenance of LTD\nbecause there is little work on this topic. There is evidence\nthat LTD is accompanied by a shrinkage in the size of\ndendritic spines (Nagerl et al, 2004; Zhou et al, 2004) and\nthat this may be due to the loss of AMPARs (Hsieh et al,\n2006). Furthermore, similar to LTP, protein translation may\nbe needed for the long-term stable expression of LTD\n(Pfeiffer and Huber, 2006). Thus, it is generally believed that\nthe activity-dependent trafficking of AMPARs into and out\nof synapses during LTP and LTD, respectively, is the first\ncritical step in the morphological growth or shrinkage of\nsynapses and that these structural modifications are the\nmechanisms by which bidirectional changes in synaptic\nstrength are maintained. Indeed, the size of individual\nsynapses correlates closely with the number of AMPARs\nthey contain (Matsuzaki et al, 2001; Nusser et al, 1998;\nTakumi et al, 1999).\nPresynaptic LTP\nAlthough the spotlight has been on NMDAR-dependent LTP\nfor over 30 years, it is clear that a mechanistically distinct\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n26\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\nform of plasticity coexists in the hippocampus at the so-\ncalled mossy fiber synapses, the synapses between the axons\nof dentate gyrus granule cells (ie, mossy fibers) and the\nproximal apical dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells (Nicoll\nand Malenka, 1995; Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005). Mossy fiber\nLTP (MF-LTP) is of increasing interest due to the fact that it\nappears to be a prototype for mechanistically similar forms\nof LTP found in several other brain regions including the\nthalamus at corticothalamic synapses (Castro-Alamancos\nand Calcagnotto, 1999), the cerebellum at parallel fiber-\nPurkinje cell synapses (Linden, 1997; Salin et al, 1996), and\nperhaps in the striatum at cortico-striatal synapses (Spencer\nand Murphy, 2002). Thus, like NMDAR-dependent LTP,\nthis form of LTP may play multiple functional roles in the\nbrain.\nIn contrast to NMDAR-dependent LTP, the triggering and\nexpression of this form of LTP is thought to be solely or\npredominantly presynaptic, thus we refer to it as presynap-\ntic LTP. While somewhat controversial, most experimental\nevidence suggests that presynaptic LTP is triggered by high-\nfrequency tetanic stimulation, which causes a large, activity-\ndependent increase in calcium concentration within pre-\nsynaptic axon terminals (Nicoll and Malenka, 1995; Nicoll\nand Schmitz, 2005; Zalutsky and Nicoll, 1990). Presynaptic\nvoltage-dependent calcium channels are the critical source\nof the calcium increase, although the triggering of this LTP\nat MF synapses can be facilitated by the activation of\npresynaptic kainate receptors, particularly GluR6 (Lauri\net al, 2001; Schmitz et al, 2003). Results from pharmaco-\nlogical manipulations and knockout mice are all consistent\nwith the hypothesis that the increase in presynaptic calcium\nactivates a calcium/calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase.\nThis leads to a increase in presynaptic cAMP and activation\nof PKA, which phosphorylates critical presynaptic sub-\nstrates to cause a long-lasting enhancement in transmitter\nrelease (Nicoll and Malenka, 1995; Nicoll and Schmitz,\n2005). Although this sequence of events is consistent with\nmost of the results from all of the synapses that have been\nreported to express presynaptic LTP, surprisingly, a very\ndifferent postsynaptic induction mechanism has been\nproposed to occur at MF synapses. This involves trans-\nsynaptic interactions between postsynaptic EphB receptor\ntyrosine kinases and presynaptic B-Ephrin ligands leading,\nvia an unknown mechanism, to a long-lasting enhancement\nof transmitter release (Armstrong et al, 2006; Contractor\net al, 2002).\nDespite some controversy concerning the mechanism\nunderlying the induction of presynaptic LTP at MF\nsynapses, there is general agreement that its expression is\ndue to an increase in neurotransmitter release. One\nmechanism\nfor\nmediating\na\nlong-lasting\nincrease\nin\ntransmitter release is to enhance the calcium influx into\nthe presynaptic terminal when it is invaded by an action\npotential; for example via a long-lasting modulation of\npresynaptic calcium channels. However, direct imaging of\nthe action potential-dependent increase in presynaptic\ncalcium in MF boutons indicates that no change occurs\nfollowing the triggering of MF-LTP (Kamiya et al, 2002;\nRegehr and Tank, 1991; Reid et al, 2004).\nThe other major mechanism for enhancing transmitter\nrelease is via some modulation of the machinery responsible\nfor synaptic vesicle exocytosis. In this context, the focus has\nbeen on presynaptic proteins known to be substrates for\nPKA. Because presynaptic terminals are relatively inacces-\nsible, an important approach has been examining knockout\nmice lacking specific presynaptic proteins. Mice lacking\nsynapsins exhibited normal MF-LTP (Spillane et al, 1995)\nindicating that these prominent PKA substrates were not\nnecessary. In contrast, knockout animals lacking the\nsynaptic vesicle protein Rab3A, a small GTPase (Castillo\net al, 1997; Lonart et al, 1998), or its binding partner, the\nactive zone protein Rim1a (Castillo et al, 2002; Powell et al,\n2004) lack both MF-LTP as well as presynaptic LTP in the\ncerebellum. Rim1a is a substrate of PKA and thus these\nfindings suggest that presynaptic LTP may require a GTP-\ndependent interaction between Rab3a and Rim1a at the\ninterface of synaptic vesicles and the active zone. Indeed,\nusing cultures of cerebellar neurons in which presynaptic\nLTP can be elicited, the critical residue phosphorylated by\nPKA in Rim1a has been identified (Lonart et al, 2003). One\nimportant caveat to this hypothesis, however, is that the\npresynaptic enhancement of synaptic transmission seen\nupon application of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin\nis unaltered in knockout mice lacking Rab3a or Rim1a. This\nprovides a complication for the simple model implicating\nRim1a and Rab3a as the crucial mediators of the enhanced\ntransmission caused by presynaptic activation of PKA.\nMetabotropic Glutamate Receptor-Dependent\nLTD\nUnder the appropriate experimental conditions, low-fre-\nquency stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural\ninputs to CA1 pyramidal cells can trigger, in addition to\nNMDAR-dependent LTD, a mechanistically distinct form of\nLTD, that is dependent upon activation of metabotropic\nglutamate receptors (mGluRs; mGLUR LTD) (Anwyl, 2006;\nBolshakov et al, 2000; Malenka and Bear, 2004; Oliet et al,\n1997). Various forms of mGluR LTD have been observed in\nmany brain regions, most notably at the parallel fiber to\nPurkinje cell synapse (Ito, 1989; Linden and Connor, 1995).\nThis so-called cerebellar LTD is elicited when parallel fibers\nare activated coincident with climbing fiber activation and\nhas been suggested to be particularly important for certain\nforms of motor learning.\nTypically, the induction of mGluR LTD in the CA1 region\nof the hippocampus requires bursts of afferent stimulation\nor paired-pulse stimulation at modest frequencies. Pre-\nsumably, this increases the likelihood of activating the\nextrasynaptic group I mGluRs that are required to trigger\nthis form of plasticity. mGluR LTD can also be elicited by\nbath application of group I mGluR agonists such as DHPG\n(Bellone and Luscher, 2005; Huber et al, 2000, 2001). Group\nI mGluRs (mGluR1 and mGluR5) are defined by their\ncapacity to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis and\nthereby produce diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate.\nAlthough mGluR1 is the principal receptor implicated in the\ninduction of mGluR LTD in the ventral tegmental area\n(VTA), cerebellum, and neostriatum, mGluR5 has been\nimplicated\nin\nthe\nhippocampus,\ncortex,\nand\nnucleus\naccumbens (Anwyl, 2006).\nThe intracellular signaling pathways responsible for\nmGluR LTD have not been extensively examined.

Other signaling\nproteins suggested to be important for mGluR LTD include\nthe MAPKs p38, Erk, and Jnk (Gallagher et al, 2004; Li et al,\n2007; Rush et al, 2002), tyrosine phosphatases (Huang and\nHsu, 2006; Moult et al, 2006), and phosphatidylinositol\n3-kinase (Hou and Klann, 2004) but how these various\nenzymes might lead to a long-lasting decrease in synaptic\nstrength is unknown.\nSimilar to NMDAR-dependent LTD, mGluR LTD in the\nhippocampus and cerebellum appears to involve clathrin-\ndependent endocytosis of AMPARs (Snyder et al, 2001;\nWang and Linden, 2000; Xiao et al, 2001). For cerebellar\nmGluR LTD, a large body of work is consistent with a\nspecific molecular model in which mGluR activation due to\nparallel fiber stimulation combined with calcium influx due\nto climbing fiber activation results in activation of PKCa\nand its targeting to synapses via the protein PICK1 (Jorntell\nand Hansel, 2006; Perez et al, 2001; Steinberg et al, 2006).\nPKCa then phosphorylates Ser880 on GluR2 causing GluR2\nto dissociate from the AMPAR-binding proteins GRIP/ABP\nand bind to PICK1. This then allows lateral diffusion of the\nAMPARs and ultimately internalization (Chung et al, 2003;\nSteinberg et al, 2006; Xia et al, 2000). This cascade of events\nis significantly different than those believed to occur during\nNMDAR-dependent LTD, pointing out that the molecular\nmechanisms underlying apparently similar forms of plasti-\ncity may be cell type-specific. Indeed, mGluR LTD at\nexcitatory synapses onto dopamine cells in the VTA has\nbeen suggested to involve a selective loss of AMPARs that\nlack the GluR2 subunit (Bellone and Luscher, 2005, 2006),\nrather than those that contain GluR2.\nAnother important feature of mGluR LTD, at least in the\nhippocampus, is that it appears to be dependent on mGluR-\ntriggered protein synthesis (Hou and Klann, 2004; Huber\net al, 2000, 2001; Snyder et al, 2001). This link between\nprotein synthesis and mGluR LTD gained considerable\nattention following the report that mice lacking the gene\nencoding the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)\nexhibited enhanced mGluR LTD in both the hippocampus\n(Huber et al, 2002) and the cerebellum (Koekkoek et al,\n2005). These mice serve as a model for the Fragile X\nsyndrome in humans, an X-linked form of mental retarda-\ntion, and exhibit several features of the human disorder\n(Bear et al, 2004). Surprisingly, the enhanced mGluR LTD\nobserved in the FMRP knockout mice is independent of\nprotein synthesis and proteasomal degradation (Hou et al,\n2006; Nosyreva and Huber, 2006), cellular processes that\nappear crucial for mGluR LTD in wild-type mice. Never-\ntheless, this potential link between an mGluR-triggered\nform of synaptic plasticity and Fragile X syndrome has\nfocused\nattention\non\nmGluR\nantagonists\nas\npossible\ntherapeutic agents for this and other developemental\ndisorders (Bear et al, 2004).\nThere are also results consistent with a presynaptic locus\nof expression for mGluR LTD (Anwyl, 2006; Nosyreva and\nHuber, 2005; Zakharenko et al, 2002). As these forms of\nmGluR LTD are still triggered postsynaptically, they must\ninvolve a retrograde messenger, one leading candidate being\n12-lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid (Feinmark\net al, 2003). In an attempt to reconcile the observations of a\npresynaptic locus of expression of mGluR LTD with the\nbulk of the literature describing a postsynaptic locus of\nexpression, a developmental shift in the mechanisms of\nmGluR LTD has been proposed (Nosyreva and Huber,\n2005). Specifically, it has been suggested that in slices\nprepared from neonatal (P8\u2013P15) animals, mGluR-LTD is\nindependent of protein synthesis and is due to a presynaptic\nmodification, whereas in older animals (P21\u2013P35) mGluR\nLTD is mediated by a protein synthesis-dependent reduc-\ntion in the postsynaptic levels of AMPARs.\nEndocannabinoid-Mediated LTD\nA major advance over the last decade has been the\ndemonstration of the existence of endogenous cannabinoids\n(termed endocannabinoids) and their roles in modulating\nsynaptic function (Chevaleyre et al, 2006; Freund et al, 2003;\nKreitzer and Regehr, 2002; Piomelli, 2003; Wilson and\nNicoll, 2002). It is now well established that in a number of\nbrain regions endocannabinoids are retrograde messengers\nthat are released by postsynaptic cells in response to strong\ndepolarization\nand/or\nactivation\nof\nG-protein-coupled\nreceptors (eg, mGluRs and muscarinic receptors) and\nfunction to transiently inhibit transmitter release (for\nB0.5\u20131 min) at either excitatory or inhibitory synpases\nvia activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors.\nMuch of the mechanistic work on the transient synaptic\neffects of endocannabinioids was performed in the hippo-\ncampus and cerebellum, synapses that are often thought to\nbe prototypic of synapses throughout the brain. It was\ntherefore surprising when a form of LTD that required\nendocannabinoids, (so-called endocannabinoid-mediated\nLTD; eCB-LTD) was observed in the glutamatergic synapses\nonto medium spiny neurons in the striatum as well as at\nsynapses between layer V pyramidal neurons (Gerdeman\net al, 2002; Robbe et al, 2002a; Sjostrom et al, 2003). In the\nhippocampus, in contrast, endocannabinoids mediate a\nform of LTD at inhibitory, but not excitatory, synapses\n(Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2004). In the dorsal striatum, eCB-\nLTD requires postsynaptic activation of group I mGluRs,\nL-type calcium channels and D2 dopamine receptors (Choi\nand Lovinger, 1997; Kreitzer and Malenka, 2005, 2007;\nPisani et al, 2005; Sung et al, 2001; Tang et al, 2001)\n(Figure 3). This leads to the production most likely of\nanandamide (Ade and Lovinger, 2007), which activates\npresynaptic CB1 receptors. However, prolonged activation\nof these CB1 receptors alone is not sufficient to elicit eCB-\nLTD; concomitant presynaptic activity is also required, a\nrequirement that likely accounts for the input specificity of\nthis form of plasticity (Singla et al, 2007). Another\nimportant feature of eCB-LTD in the dorsal striatum is\nthat it appears to be restricted to the medium spiny neurons\nthat primarily express D2 dopamine receptors and is not\npresent at excitatory synapses on cells expressing D1\nreceptors (Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007; but see Wang\net al, 2006). This cell-restricted expression of eCB-LTD\nmay have important functional implications, a topic to be\ndiscussed below.\nIn the nucleus accumbens (NAc), eCB-LTD also requires\npostsynaptic activation of group I mGluRs and is modulated\nby drugs of abuse (Fourgeaud et al, 2004; Mato et al, 2004;\nRobbe et al, 2002b). In the cortex, eCB-LTD can be elicited\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n28\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\nby a spike-timing-dependent protocol (Sjostrom et al, 2003)\nbut does not depend on postsynaptic activation of mGluRs\nand surprisingly, requires coincident activation of presy-\nnaptic NMDARs. LTD in the cerebellum was also reported\nto depend on retrograde endocannabinoid signaling (Safo\nand Regehr, 2005), but the mechanistic basis for this\nobservation is still unclear, since, as discussed above,\ncerebellar LTD is expressed postsynaptically.\nMetaplasticity\nMetaplasticity refers to a higher-order form of synaptic\nplasticity in which synaptic activity, which by itself does not\ndirectly affect synaptic efficacy, leads to a persistent change\nin the direction or magnitude of subsequent activity-\ndependent synaptic plasticity. In other words, metaplasti-\ncity is the \u2018plasticity of plasticity\u2019 (Abraham and Bear, 1996;\nBear et al, 1987). The best-studied examples of metaplas-\nticity are those in which prior activity shifts the threshold\nfor LTP and LTD induction. For example, in the hippo-\ncampus, repetitive activation of NMDARs in a manner that\ndoes not elicit LTP or LTD can nonetheless elicit a rapid\nshift in plasticity thresholds such that LTP becomes difficult\nto elicit and LTD induction is favored (Huang et al, 1992;\nWang and Wagner, 1999). A potential functional role for\nmetaplasticity has been demonstrated by modifying the\nlevel of activity during the development of the visual cortex\nin vivo (Philpot et al, 2001, 2003, 2007). This causes shifts in\nthe thresholds for LTP and LTD in cells in visual cortex\npresumably due to changes in the stoichiometry of synaptic\nNMDARs. As discussed below, such changes in synaptic\nplasticity may importantly contribute to the experience-\ndependent plasticity of ocular dominance following mani-\npulation of the visual environment.\nSynaptic Scaling: A Form of Homeostatic\nPlasticity\nTheoretically, without additional stabilizing mechanisms,\nactivity-dependent forms of plasticity such as LTP and LTD\ncould drive neural circuit activity towards epileptogenic\nexcitation or complete quiescence. Synaptic scaling is\nconsidered a form of homeostatic plasticity that counters\npotentially maladaptive effects of long-term synapse-spe-\ncific\nplasticity\nby\nglobally\naffecting\nthe\ntransmission\nthrough all synapses on a given neuron (Turrigiano and\nNelson, 2004). In terms of its basic properties and under-\nlying mechanisms, this form of synaptic plasticity contrasts\ndramatically with the forms of LTP and LTD we have\ndiscussed thus far.\nSynaptic scaling occurs when network activity is drama-\ntically decreased or increased for prolonged (4B12\u201324 h)\nperiods of time. Decreased activity (due to blockade of\nsynaptic transmission or spiking) causes an increase in the\nstrength of all excitatory synapses onto excitatory neurons,\nwhereas increased activity (generally induced by partially\nblocking inhibitory synapses) reduces the strength of all\nexcitatory synapses (Turrigiano et al, 1998). Importantly,\nthe relative strengths of individual synpases appear to be\nmaintained even though global synaptic input is signifi-\ncantly altered.\nRelatively little is known about the molecular mechan-\nisms underlying synaptic scaling other than it involves\nchanges in the number of AMPARs (and NMDARs) at\nindividual synapses (Perez-Otano and Ehlers, 2005; Turri-\ngiano and Nelson, 2004; Watt et al, 2000) and likely\npresynaptic changes as well (Burrone and Murthy, 2003;\nBurrone et al, 2002). Recently, evidence has been presented\nsupporting a role for secreted factors in the induction of\nhomeostatic plasticity, suggesting that key triggers for this\nform of plasticity may not be cell autonomous. Specifically,\nsecretion of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis\nfactor-a from glial cells appears to be necessary for the\nincrease in the level of synaptic AMPARs caused by\nextended periods of activity blockade (Beattie et al, 2002;\nStellwagen et al, 2005; Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006). In\naddition, there is evidence suggesting a role for secreted\nBDNF in driving the opposite form of synaptic scaling; the\ndecrease in synaptic strengths caused by extended periods\nof increased network acitivity (Rutherford et al, 1998;\nTurrigiano, 2006).\nFUNCTIONAL ROLES OF LTP AND LTD\nAlthough LTP and LTD are prime candidate mechanisms\nunderlying many different forms of experience-dependent\nplasticity, it is important to remember that they are\nexperimental phenomena used to examine how different\nCa2+\nAMPAR\nPostsynaptic \ncell\nPresynaptic \nterminal\nLTD\nL-type VSCC\nLipid \nprecursor\neCB\nmGluR1/5\nD2R\nCB1R\nPLC\u03b2?\nFigure 3\nModel of eCB-LTD at excitatory synapses onto medium spiny\nneurons in the striatum.

Co-activation of postsynaptic dopamine D2-type\nreceptors (D2R) enhances endocannabinoid production and the subse-\nquent induction of presynaptic LTD, mediated through activation of\npresynaptic CB1 receptors (CB1R).

Establishing a causal connection between\na specific form of synaptic plasticity and the behavioral\nconsequences of specific experiences remains a daunting\ntask. Nevertheless, over the last decade, significant advances\nhave been made in connecting synaptic plasticity to a\nnumber of different types of adaptive experience-dependent\nplasticity. Furthermore, it has become increasingly clear\nthat understanding the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity\nmay provide important insights into the pathophysiology of\na variety of neuropsychiatric disorders and also point the\nway toward novel therapeutic approaches. In the following\nsections, we will briefly provide examples that demonstrate\nthat LTP and LTD do occur in vivo in response to\nexperience and may play a causal role in mediating the\nconsequences of experience.\nHippocampal-Dependent Plasticity and Learning\nGiven that LTP was first described in the hippocampus, a\nstructure well established to be critically important for\ndeclarative memory (Squire et al, 2004), it is not surprising\nthat over the last three decades there has been a major effort\naimed at demonstrating a role for hippocampal LTP in\nencoding new memories (Martin et al, 2000; Morris, 2006).\nCorrelations have been observed between defective hippo-\ncampal synaptic plasticity and defective hippocampal-\ndependent memory tasks upon perturbation of a number\nof proteins which function in synaptic plasticity, either\npharmacologically, or through gene knockout (Lynch, 2004;\nMartin et al, 2000; Morris, 2006). For example, rodents in\nwhich NMDAR antagonists were infused into the hippo-\ncampus (Morris and Frey, 1997), as well as mice lacking\nexpression of the NMDAR subunit NR1 in the forebrain\n(Tsien et al, 1996), are defective both in LTP and certain\ntypes of spatial learning. Furthermore, mice in which the\nspecific NMDAR subunit NR2B was overexpressed to\nenhance\nNMDAR\nfunction\nwere\nreported\nto\ndisplay\nenhanced LTP and enhanced spatial learning (Tang et al,\n1999). Recently, more compelling evidence for a role of\nsynaptic plasticity in hippocampal-dependent learning has\nbeen presented. During an inhibitory avoidance task, LTP\ncould be recorded in vivo in a subset of hippocampal CA1\npyramidal cells (Whitlock et al, 2006). This demonstrated\nthat the patterns of activity generated during a real learning\ntask were sufficient to elicit LTP. Perhaps even more\nconvincing was the demonstration that in vivo infusion of a\nPKMz\ninhibitor\ninto\nthe\nhippocampus\nabolished\nthe\nmaintenance of LTP and simultaneously the storage of a\nlong-lasting spatial memory (Pastalkova et al, 2006). These\nfindings strongly suggest that maintained LTP was required\nfor the engram that stored the key spatial information.\nIn addition to its role as a key component of the\nmechanisms underlying the encoding of declarative mem-\nories, hippocampal NMDAR-dependent LTP (as well as\nLTD) may provide important insights into the pathophy-\nsiology and potential treatment of major mental illnesses.\nFor example, a leading hypothesis for the pathophysiology\nof schizophrenia posits a dysfunction in glutamatergic\nsynapses, in particular a hypofunction of NMDARs (Coyle\nand Tsai, 2004; Javitt, 2006; McCullumsmith et al, 2004;\nTamminga, 1998). Thus, understanding the signaling events\ndownstream of NMDAR activation may provide important\ninsights into this devastating disease. A role for dysfunc-\ntions in LTP and/or LTD mechanisms as possible con-\ntributors\nto\nschizophrenia\nis\nalso\nattractive\nin\nthat\nschizophrenia likely involves neurodevelopmental abnorm-\nalities (Lewis and Levitt, 2002) and these phenomena play\nan important role in the early postnatal development of\nneural circuitry (see below). Indeed, genetic variation in\ncalcineurin, which is thought to play an important role in\nNMDAR-dependent LTD, has been associated with schizo-\nphrenia (Gerber et al, 2003).\nAnother example of the potential importance of studying\nLTP and LTD comes from investigation into the therapeutic\nmechanisms of drugs used to treat bipolar disorder. Drugs\nsuch as lithium, valproate, and lamotrigine have been\nreported to have significant effects on the phosphorylation\nof AMPAR subunits and affect their surface expression (Du\net al, 2003, 2004, 2007; Gray et al, 2003). These findings\nsuggest that these drugs may somehow tap into the same\nmechanisms that have evolved to generate LTP and LTD\nand also point to novel approaches for the development of\nnew therapeutic agents that may prove efficacious for\ntreatment of this illness.\nExperience-Dependent Plasticity in the\nDeveloping Sensory Cortex\nSensory receptive fields in the cortex are modified by early\npostnatal\nexperience\nand\nthe\nlink\nbetween\nsynaptic\nplasticity and these forms of experience-dependent plasti-\ncity in sensory systems is becoming increasingly established\n(Foeller and Feldman, 2004; Karmarkar and Dan, 2006;\nMalenka and Bear, 2004). For example, a strong connection\nbetween\nsynaptic\nplasticity\nand\nexperience-dependent\nplasticity has been established in the visual system during\nthe shift in ocular dominance caused by monocular\ndeprivation (MD) (Foeller and Feldman, 2004; Karmarkar\nand Dan, 2006; Malenka and Bear, 2004). MD induces\nbiochemical changes in AMPAR subunits in visual cortex\nthat appear identical to those elicited during NMDAR-\ndependent LTD (Heynen et al, 2003) and visual cortical\nslices obtained from monocularly deprived animals show\ngreatly reduced LTD (Crozier et al, 2007; Heynen et al,\n2003), suggesting that LTD was elicited in vivo. Further-\nmore, in vivo recordings demonstrated that MD caused a\nrapid decrease in the visually evoked potential (VEP) from\nthe deprived eye and a slower enhancement of the VEP from\nthe open eye (Frenkel and Bear, 2004). Importantly,\ncompletely blocking activity in the deprived eye prevented\nthe depression of the VEP demonstrating that this depres-\nsion required retinal activity and, like LTD, was therefore\nactivity-dependent (Frenkel and Bear, 2004).\nSimilar results have been obtained in somatosensory\nbarrel cortex in that sensory deprivation by whisker\ntrimming or plucking causes a weakening of synaptic\nresponses in layer 2/3 cells and an occlusion of LTD (Allen\net al, 2003). This appears to be due to alterations in the\npatterns of pre- and postsynaptic spiking in vivo in a\nmanner that is ideal for generating spike-timing-dependent\nLTD (Celikel et al, 2004). LTP mechanisms, on the other\nhand, appear to be important for the strengthening of\nsynapses in developing barrel cortex due to early postnatal\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n30\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\nexperience. In vivo experience drives recombinant GluR1\ninto barrel cortex synapses in a manner similar to that\nwhich occurs during NMDAR-dependent LTP, whereas\nexpression of a short peptide that inhibits delivery of\nendogenous AMPARs blocks the experience-dependent\nincrease in synaptic strength (Takahashi et al, 2003) as\ndoes a dominant-negative form of the synaptic scaffold\nprotein PSD-95 (Ehrlich and Malinow, 2004). Thus, as\npredicted by theoretical considerations (Bienenstock et al,\n1982; Stent, 1973), LTP and LTD mechanisms appear to be\ncritically involved in early neural circuit development and it\nis not difficult\nto\nimagine how disruption\nin these\nmechanisms might contribute to a host of neurodevelope-\nmental disorders such as autism (Geschwind and Levitt,\n2007; Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003).\nSynaptic Plasticity and Fear Conditioning\nPavlovian fear conditioning is a form of associative memory\nthat depends on the amygdala for its induction and\nmaintenance (Sigurdsson et al, 2007). It occurs when a\nneutral stimulus (such as a tone) is temporally paired with a\nstrong noxious stimulus (such as an electric shock) creating\na memory trace, the consequences of which are that the\nneutral stimulus elicits the learned fear response. Consider-\nable evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that LTP at\nsensory inputs to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala is\nnecessary and perhaps sufficient for establishing this\nengram (Sigurdsson et al, 2007). NMDAR-dependent LTP\ncan be induced at cortical and thalamic inputs into the\nlateral amygdala, both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, fear\nconditioning induces synaptic potentiation at these sy-\nnapses, and this increase in synaptic strength occludes\nfurther induction of LTP (McKernan and Shinnick-Galla-\ngher, 1997; Rogan et al, 1997; Tsvetkov et al, 2002). Like\nNMDAR-dependent LTP in the hippocampus, fear con-\nditioning has also been shown to lead to the insertion of\nnew AMPARs at thalamic input synapses onto lateral\namygdala neurons (Rumpel et al, 2005) and perhaps most\nconvincingly, expression of a peptide that prevents the LTP-\ninduced incorporation of AMPARs at synapses abolished\nacquisition of this form of associative memory (Rumpel\net al, 2005).\nNMDARs in the amgydala are also involved in the\nextinction of learned fear, which can be conceptualized as a\ndifferent form of learning (Myers and Davis, 2002).\nFurthermore, acute treatment with D-cycloserine, a partial\nagonist of NMDARs, enhances the learning processes that\nare responsible for fear extinction via actions in the\namygdala (Walker et al, 2002). On the basis of these\nobservations, clinical trials have been initiated using D-\ncycloserine in combination with behavioral therapy to\nenhance the extinction of fear in phobic patients (Hofmann\net al, 2006; Otto et al, 2007; Ressler et al, 2004). Results to\ndate suggest that the administration of D-cycloserine either\nbefore or shortly after exposure to fearful cues does in fact\nenhance the extinction of the anxiety previously associated\nwith specific cues. Thus, the study of the neural substrates\nof learned fear and its extinction is a compelling example of\nhow research on the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity has\ndirectly led to a potential novel treatment for common\npsychiatric disorders.\nSynaptic Plasticity in Dopamine Circuits\nThe defining characteristic of drug addiction is persistent\nand compulsive seeking and ingestion of drugs despite\nadverse consequences. Over the last decade, a leading\nhypothesis has been that an important neural substrate\nof\naddiction,\nin\nparticular\nrelapse,\nis\nlong-term\nassociative memory processes occurring in several neural\ncircuits\nthat\nreceive\ninput\nfrom\nmidbrain\ndopamine\nneurons (Everitt and Robbins, 2005; Hyman et al, 2006).\nIn other words, it is thought that addictive drugs can usurp\nthe normal adaptive mechanisms underlying reward-based\nlearning.\nThe most well-established key site of action of addictive\ndrugs is the mesolimbic dopamine system consisting of the\nVTA and the NAc. Excitatory synaptic transmission in these\nstructures is critical for mediating several forms of long-\nlasting, drug-induced behavioral plasticity (Everitt and\nWolf, 2002; Hyman and Malenka, 2001). It, therefore, has\nbeen reasonable to hypothesize that plasticity at these\nsynapses plays an important role in mediating some of the\nbehavioral consequences of exposure to drugs of abuse\n(Wolf, 1998).\nIndeed, it is now established that various forms of LTP\nand LTD can be elicited at excitatory synapses in the VTA\nand NAc (Gerdeman et al, 2003; Kauer, 2004; Kelley, 2004;\nThomas and Malenka, 2003). Furthermore, administration\nof a single dose of several different classes of drugs of abuse\ncauses\na significant increase\nin synaptic strength at\nexcitatory synapses onto dopamine cells in the VTA (Faleiro\net al, 2004; Saal et al, 2003; Ungless et al, 2001). This\nincrease shares mechanisms with LTP in the VTA and\nappears to involve upregulation of AMPARs (Ungless et al,\n2001). This drug-induced \u2018LTP\u2019 appears to play a functional\nrole in triggering or mediating some drug-induced beha-\nvioral adaptations, as both conditioned place preference\nand behavioral sensitization are blocked by injection of\nglutamate receptor antagonists into the VTA (Harris and\nAston-Jones, 2003; Vanderschuren and Kalivas, 2000). In\naddition, conditioned place preference, as well as the\nsynaptic potentiation that is observed following cocaine\nadministration, are impaired in GluR1 knockout mice\n(Dong et al, 2004), with the caveat that these mice still\nexhibit robust behavioral sensitization in response to\nrepeated exposure to psychostimulants (Dong et al, 2004;\nVekovischeva et al, 2001).\nWhile drugs of abuse have been observed to induce LTP\nin the VTA, LTD has been observed in the NAc following\nchronic in vivo cocaine administration (Thomas et al,\n2001). Consistent with a functional role for this LTD in\naddiction, injection of glutamate receptor antagonists into\nthe NAc abolishes the expression of behavioral sensitization\n(Kelley, 2004). Furthermore, amphetamine-induced beha-\nvioral sensitization and LTD in the NAc were both abolished\nby injection into the NAc of inhibitors of AMPAR\nendocytosis (Brebner et al, 2005). Interestingly, overexpres-\nsion of GluR1 in the NAc (mimicking an \u2018LTP\u2019-like\ncondition) facilitates the extinction of cocaine-seeking\n(Sutton et al, 2003) and even makes cocaine aversive in a\nconditioned place preference assay (Kelz et al, 1999).\nRecently, it has also been reported that cocaine self-\nadministration abolishes the ability to induce LTD in the\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n31\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\ncore of the NAc after prolonged (21 days) abstinence\n(Martin\net\nal,\n2006)\nand\nin\nvivo\nadministration\nof\ntetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cocaine impairs the gene-\nration of eCB-LTD (Fourgeaud et al, 2004; Mato et al, 2004;\nRobbe et al, 2002b). Thus, drugs of abuse may elicit certain\nforms of synaptic plasticity in specific circuits while\nsimultaneously impairing plasticity in other circuits.\nSynaptic plasticity in the dorsal striatum has also been\ncorrelated with certain learned behaviors, in particular in\nmotor control (Gubellini et al, 2004; Pisani et al, 2005). In\nthis context, it is important to note that two independent\nstriatal circuits are thought to exist, the so-called \u2018direct\u2019\nand \u2018indirect\u2019 pathways, which subserve different functions\nin motor control (Bolam et al, 2000). Indirect pathway\nmedium spiny neurons (MSNs) project to the lateral globus\npallidus and primarily express D2 dopamine receptors while\ndirect pathway MSNs project to the substantia nigra and\nexpress D1 dopamine receptors. As mentioned in the\nsection on eCB-LTD, this form of plasticity is primarily\nrestricted to the indirect pathway MSNs and is absent in\nParkinson\u2019s disease models (Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007).\nHowever,\nin\nslices\nfrom\ndopamine-depleted\nanimals,\nindirect pathway eCB-LTD can be rescued by a D2 receptor\nagonist or pharmacological inhibitors of endocannabinoid\ndegradation. Remarkably, administration of these drugs\ntogether in vivo dramatically reduces Parkinsonian motor\ndeficits suggesting that endocannabinoid-mediated depres-\nsion of indirect pathway synapses has a critical role in\nmotor control and may be a valuable target for therapy of\nstriatal-based brain disorders (Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007).\nThis works also points out the potential power of examining\nthe mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and placing them in\nthe context of the neural circuits in which they are found.\nFuture Directions\nWe have attempted to briefly review the enormous field of\nsynaptic plasticity research in a concise and accessible\nmanner so that by the end of this article, readers will have a\nreasonably up to date knowledge of current thinking about\nthe mechanisms underlying the major forms of synaptic\nplasticity in the mammalian brain and a sense of what their\nin vivo functions might be. By necessity we have had to\nleave out important topics such as how synaptic activity\nmodulates NMDAR-mediated synaptic responses (eg, Mor-\nishita et al, 2005), inhibitory synaptic responses (Chevaleyre\net al, 2006), or the intrinsic excitability of neurons (Xu and\nKang, 2005; Zhang and Linden, 2003), all of which will have\nprofound effects on neural circuit function. Furthermore,\nseveral\ncompelling\nexamples\nthat\ncorrelate\nlong-term\nsynaptic plasticity with experience-dependent modifications\nin behavior have been left out, such as the role of cerebellar\nLTD in motor learning (Boyden et al, 2004; Ito, 2002;\nJorntell and Hansel, 2006).\nThis review should also make clear that while extensive\nprogress has been made, much remains unknown. Even for\nthe most established forms of plasticity, NMDAR-depen-\ndent LTP and LTD in the CA1 region of the hippocampus,\nwe\nstill\nknow\nlittle\nabout\nthe\ndetails\nof\nthe\nsignal\ntransduction pathways triggering these forms of plasticity\nand which specific proteins are being modified to cause the\nchanges in synaptic efficacy. We also know little about the\nmolecular mechanisms underlying the structural changes in\nsynapses that seem to accompany LTP and LTD. With the\naccumulation of evidence demonstrating that long-term\nsynaptic modifications do in fact play important roles in a\nhost of adaptive brain functions, we believe there is strong\njustification to continue efforts toward establishing the\ndetailed molecular basis of the various forms of synaptic\nplasticity. This is particularly important because, as we have\ntried to make clear, such knowledge is likely to have a major\nimpact on our understanding and treatment of a wide range\nof brain disorders.\nWhat direction do we envision the field taking in the near\nfuture? By definition, synaptic plasticity is an electrophy-\nsiological phenomenon. Only by recording synaptic re-\nsponses can the investigator be sure that synaptic function\nhas been modified. Until relatively recently, most electro-\nphysiological studies depended on pharmacological manip-\nulations of proteins, an approach that was aided by the use\nof genetically modified mice. Thus far, gene knockout\nexperiments addressing the function of B200 genes have\nbeen reported and close to 80% of these report effects on\nsynaptic transmission or plasticity (Grant, 2006). With the\ngrowing consensus that NMDAR-dependent LTP is primar-\nily mediated by an increase in postsynaptic AMPARs, while\nLTD is associated with loss of AMPARs from the PSD, there\nalso has been an increased contribution of cell biologists\nwho have focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying\nthe changes in the levels of postsynaptic receptors as well as\nthe changes in synaptic structure that occur. Indeed, a close\ninterdependence has emerged between electrophysiologists\nand cell biologists and this has dramatically impacted the\nfield. Thus, electrophysiologists are increasingly making use\nof tools that enable overexpression, knockdown, and\nmolecular replacement of target proteins both in vitro and\nin vivo (eg, Schluter et al, 2006). These advances are\nenabling a true molecular dissection of the mechanisms\nunderlying plasticity of mammalian brain synapses.\nRecent advances in high-throughput technologies, such as\ngene-chip microarrays for mRNA profiling and advanced\nmass spectrometry for identification of multiple proteins in\na mixed population, have enabled the identification of the\nmolecular components of many biological phenomena and\ncontributed significantly to understanding their regulation.\nFurthermore, the recent advent of \u2018systems biology\u2019 has\ncontributed a number of conceptual advances that enable\nclearer interpretation of the complex interaction networks\nobserved in signal transduction cascades (Alon, 2006).\nThese advances have so far only lightly impacted the field of\nsynaptic plasticity (Pocklington et al, 2006), but we envision\nthat they will have increasing influence in the near future,\ndespite the technical difficulties that are encountered when\ntrying to apply these approaches to the inherently complex\npreparations used in the study of synaptic plasticity.\nWhat might we gain from such studies? A clearer picture\nof the molecules which participate in the processes under-\nlying the different forms of synaptic plasticity, and the\ndynamics of their activation and interactions, would enable\nthe formulation of much more sophisticated models of the\nevents underlying the triggering, expression, and main-\ntenance of specific forms of synaptic plasticity. This in turn\nwould create a strong foundation for focused efforts aimed\nat identifying the central pathways mediating synaptic\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n32\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\nplasticity and assaying their relevance to the phenomenon\nmeasured electrophysiologically.\nBy combining electrophysiological, molecular, cell biolo-\ngical and proteomic approaches, we envision that the next\nfew decades will bring further clarification of the detailed\nmolecular mechanisms underlying the major forms of\nsynaptic plasticity that we have discussed in this review.\nThe use of more sophisticated molecular and genetic\nmanipulations, in particular, the development of mouse\nlines with highly restricted expression of transgenes that\ncan be turned on or off with fine temporal control, will\nsimultaneously facilitate the examination of the neural\ncircuit basis of behavior.

Saltiel1,3\n1Life Sciences Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. 2Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases and  \n3Departments of Internal Medicine and Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.\nAdipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) infiltrate adipose tissue during obesity and contribute to insulin resis-\ntance. We hypothesized that macrophages migrating to adipose tissue upon high-fat feeding may differ from \nthose that reside there under normal diet conditions. To this end, we found a novel F4/80+CD11c+ population \nof ATMs in adipose tissue of obese mice that was not seen in lean mice. ATMs from lean mice expressed many \ngenes characteristic of M2 or \u201calternatively activated\u201d macrophages, including Ym1, arginase 1, and Il10. Diet-\ninduced obesity decreased expression of these genes in ATMs while increasing expression of genes such as \nthose encoding TNF-\u03b1 and iNOS that are characteristic of M1 or \u201cclassically activated\u201d macrophages. Interest-\ningly, ATMs from obese C-C motif chemokine receptor 2\u2013KO (Ccr2-KO) mice express M2 markers at levels similar \nto those from lean mice. The antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10, which was overexpressed in ATMs from lean \nmice, protected adipocytes from TNF-\u03b1\u2013induced insulin resistance. Thus, diet-induced obesity leads to a shift \nin the activation state of ATMs from an M2-polarized state in lean animals that may protect adipocytes from \ninflammation to an M1 proinflammatory state that contributes to insulin resistance.\nIntroduction\nRecent investigations suggest that obesity gives rise to a state \nof chronic, low-grade inflammation that contributes to insulin \nresistance and type 2 diabetes (1, 2). Although the tissues and cell \ntypes involved in this inflammatory response are not fully under-\nstood, there is significant interest in the role of adipose tissue \nmacrophages (ATMs) in the inflammatory changes characteristic \nof obesity (3). In both humans and rodents, ATMs accumulate \nin adipose tissue with increasing body weight and their quantity \ncorrelates with measures of insulin resistance (4\u20136). In obese sub-\njects, ATM content is higher in visceral than subcutaneous adi-\npose tissue, consistent with the hypothesis that visceral fat plays \na more prominent role in insulin resistance (7). Moreover, weight \nloss leads to a reduction in both inflammatory markers and ATM \ncontent (4, 7). ATMs are a prominent source of proinflammatory \ncytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 that can block insulin action in \nadipocytes, providing a potential link between inflammation and \ninsulin resistance (6, 8).\nMouse models have demonstrated that ATMs are both neces-\nsary and sufficient for the development of insulin resistance with \nobesity. Mice with targeted deletions in the genes for monocyte \nchemoattractant protein\u20131 (Mcp1/Ccl2) and its receptor C-C motif \nchemokine receptor 2 (Ccr2) both have decreased ATM content, \ndecreased inflammation in fat, and protection from high-fat \ndiet\u2013induced (HFD-induced) insulin resistance (9, 10). Converse-\nly, mice overexpressing MCP-1 have increased numbers of ATMs \nalong with increased insulin resistance (9, 11). Moreover, myeloid-\nspecific KO of I\u03baB kinase \u03b2 (Ikbkb) produced mice with improved \ninsulin sensitivity on HFD (12). Together, these data suggest that \nboth the recruitment and proinflammatory activation of ATMs \nare required for the development of diabetes with obesity.\nWhile quantitative changes in ATM content with obesity and \ndiabetes are well supported, little is known about the range of \nATM function and how this may change with obesity. ATMs are \npresent in moderate quantities in adipose tissue of lean mice \nin which inflammatory signals are low or nonexistent (5, 6), \nand their role there is unclear. While Ccr2-KO (CCR2KO) and \nMcp1-KO mice have lower inflammatory cytokine expression \nin fat, they retain significant macrophage content within adi-\npose tissue (9, 10). This suggests that factors both dependent \nand independent of the MCP-1/CCR2 axis are involved in mac-\nrophage recruitment to fat and, further, that not all ATMs are \nprogrammed for proinflammatory signaling.\nMacrophages show significant heterogeneity in function, as local \nenvironmental factors shape their properties and activation state \n(13, 14). Different stimuli activate macrophages to express distinct \npatterns of chemokines, surface markers, and metabolic enzymes \nthat ultimately generate the diversity of macrophage function seen \nin inflammatory and noninflammatory settings. Macrophage acti-\nvation has been operationally defined across 2 separate polarization \nstates, M1 and M2 (13, 14). These states have largely been defined \nin vitro, and tissue macrophages are likely activated along a con-\ntinuum between these states in vivo. M1 or \u201cclassically activated\u201d \nmacrophages are induced by proinflammatory mediators such as \nLPS and IFN-\u03b3. M1 macrophages have enhanced proinflammatory \ncytokine production (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-12) and generate reactive oxy-\ngen species such as NO via activation of iNOS (Nos2).\nM2 or \u201calternatively activated\u201d macrophages are generated in \nvitro by exposure to IL-4 and IL-13 (15). M2 macrophages have \nlow proinflammatory cytokine expression and instead generate \nhigh levels of antiinflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-1 decoy \nreceptor. Additionally, arginase production is increased in M2-\npolarized macrophages. This enzyme blocks iNOS activity by a \nvariety of mechanisms, including competing for the arginine sub-\nstrate that is required for NO production (16).

M2 \npolarization can occur in the absence of IL-4 or IL-13, suggesting \nthat this state may be induced by several different factors (17). \nMoreover, recent studies have shown that IL-4\u2013mediated M2 \npolarization is associated with the activation of transcription fac-\ntors involved in lipid oxidative metabolism that include PPAR\u03b3 \nand PPAR\u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b2 (PGC-1\u03b2) (18).\nIn mice, distinct monocyte subsets contribute to tissue inflam-\nmatory responses (13, 19). Noninflamed tissues are populated \nwith macrophages derived from CX3CR1hiCCR2\u2013 monocytes \n(20). In contrast, acute inflammation increases the levels of \nCX3CR1loCCR2+Ly-6Chi monocytes, which have a higher capac-\nity for migration into inflamed tissues compared with other \nmonocyte populations (21). This model is consistent with obser-\nvations that CCR2KO mice have decreased ATM content (10), \npresumably due to deficient recruitment of CX3CR1loCCR2+ \nmonocytes with retention of the trafficking of CX3CR1hiCCR2\u2013 \nmonocytes into adipose tissue.\nThe qualitative differences between these monocyte/macrophage \nsubtypes in ATMs and obesity are unknown but may be impor-\ntant in understanding the biology of these unique cells and their \ncontribution to diabetes. In this regard, we show here that ATMs \nundergo a phenotypic switch from an antiinflammatory M2 polar-\nization state to a proinflammatory M1 polarization state upon \nhigh-fat feeding, in the process losing their protective capacity.\nResults\nF4/80+CD11b+CD11c+ macrophages accumulate in fat with diet-induced \nobesity. As the majority of previous studies have used F4/80 expres-\nsion as a single marker to identify ATMs, we sought to examine \nATM heterogeneity in lean and obese mice using additional known \nmacrophage markers. Epididymal fat tissue plays a significant role \nin overall metabolism in rodents (22). We thus isolated stromal \nvascular fraction (SVF) cells from epididymal fat pads excised from \nmale mice fed a normal diet (ND) or HFD and analyzed cells by \nflow cytometry. ATMs from both lean and obese mice coexpressed \nF4/80 and CD11b, and the majority of the F4/80+CD11b+ cells \nalso expressed Mac-3 (data not shown). However, there was varia-\ntion in the amount of CD11c expression within the F4/80+CD11b+ \nATMs. The SVF from lean mice contained 17.8% F4/80+ cells, con-\nsistent with other reports (5). Only a small percentage of these cells \ncoexpressed CD11c (9.3% \u00b1 7.5%; n = 3 pools of mice) (Figure 1A). \nIn contrast, obese mice contained increased F4/80+ cell content \nwithin the SVF, with a significant increase in the percentage of \nF4/80+CD11c+ cells (38.4% \u00b1 15% of F4/80+ cells; P = 0.04 versus \nlean mice). These cells also expressed CD11b. Similar results were \nseen in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, with 74% of the F4/80+ cells \ncoexpressing CD11c (data not shown).\nThe total number of both F4/80+CD11c+ cells (4.52 \u00b1 1.1 \u00d7 106 \ncells/mouse versus 0.196 \u00b1 0.16 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse; P = 0.021) \nand F4/80+CD11c\u2013 cells (1.98 \u00b1 0.42 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse versus \n9.69 \u00b1 8.2 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse; P = 0.24) isolated from epididymal \nFigure 1\nAccumulation of F4/80+CD11c+ ATMs in adipose \ntissue in obese mice.

Normalizing this data to fat pad weight indicated \nthat there was a 5.5-fold increase in the content of F4/80+CD11c+ \ncells in adipose tissue from HFD-fed compared with ND mice \n(Figure 1C). In contrast, there was no significant change in the \nquantity of F4/80+CD11c\u2013 cells in adipose tissue per milligram \nfat weight between ND and HFD mice. This demonstrates that \nF4/80+CD11c+ cells are a specific population of ATMs recruited \nto fat tissue upon HFD exposure.\nPrevious studies indicated that targeted deletion of the Ccr2 gene \nresults in decreased macrophage content in adipose tissue and \nimproved insulin sensitivity (10). Thus, CCR2KO mice were also \nexamined for CD11c expression as a complementary mouse model. \nHFD-fed CCR2KO mice demonstrated a reduction in the content \nof F4/80+CD11c+ cells in the SVF compared with wild-type obese \nmice, with 14.4% \u00b1 9.2% of the F4/80+ cells coexpressing CD11c \n(P = 0.08 versus HFD C57BL/6) (Figure 1D). Normalizing for cell \nnumber and fat weight indicated that there was a greater than 50% \nreduction in the level of F4/80+CD11c+ ATMs in the CCR2KO mice \n(HFD C57BL/6, 2.4 \u00b1 0.46 \u00d7 103 cells/mg versus HFD CCR2KO, \n0.88 \u00b1 0.98 \u00d7 103 cells/mg) (Figure 1C). The content of total \nF4/80+CD11c+ cells in fat pads from HFD CCR2KO mice was also \nlower than in obese controls after normalization to cell number \n(Figure 1B). Similar to what was observed previously (10), adipo-\ncyte size was increased in HFD CCR2KO mice compared with con-\ntrol HFD mice (mean 7,933 \u00b1 2,754 \u03bcm2 versus 6,704 \u00b1 2,961 \u03bcm2, \u2002\nP = 0.041) and HFD CCR2KO mice were protected from hepatic \nsteatosis (data not shown). Contrary to these observations, how-\never, we noted increased fat pad weight in HFD CCR2KO mice \u2002\n(2.83 \u00b1 0.57 g versus control, 1.41 \u00b1 0.25 g; P = 0.011).\nImmunofluorescence microscopy confirmed the flow cytometry \nresults; ND SVF cultures contained only F4/80+CD11c\u2013 cells (Fig-\nure 2A). SVF cells from HFD mice showed a mix of F4/80+CD11c+ \nand F4/80+CD11c\u2013 cells. Immunohistochemistry on epididymal \nfat pads from obese mice localized CD11c+ cells in macrophage \nclusters surrounding adipocytes (Figure 2B). The CD11c antibody \nstained a subset of cells in these crownlike structures, while F4/80 \nstained nearly all of the cells in these clusters. Scattered individual \nCD11c+ ATMs were observed surrounding adipocytes in what may \nhave been early ATM clusters (Figure 2C). Rare CD11c+ cells were \nseen in adipose tissue sections from lean mice.\nIncreased inflammatory gene expression in F4/80+CD11c+ ATMs. \nBecause CD11c+ cells appear to accumulate in adipose tissue after \nhigh-fat feeding, we assessed expression of inflammatory genes in \nF4/80+CD11c+ ATMs compared with F4/80+CD11c\u2013 ATMs from \nobese mice. Real-time RT-PCR showed appropriate sorting of the \nCD11c populations based on expression of integrin, alpha X (Itgax, \nencoding CD11c) (Figure 3). F4/80+CD11c+ cells overexpressed \nthe inflammatory genes Il6 (IL-6) and Nos2 (iNOS) compared with \nF4/80+CD11c\u2013 ATMs. Tnfa (TNF-\u03b1) was not differentially expressed \nbetween the cell types, while Apoe (apoE) was downregulated in the \nF4/80+CD11c+ population relative to F4/80+CD11c\u2013 cells.\nATMs from lean mice express markers of alternatively activated mac-\nrophages. Given the low level of inflammatory cytokine expression \nin adipose tissue from lean mice, we examined the ATMs derived \nfrom lean mice for known markers of alternatively activated M2 \nFigure 2\nCD11c+ ATMs in SVF cultures and in adipose tissue from obese mice. \n(A) Identification of F4/80+ and CD11c+ ATMs by immunofluorescence \nmicroscopy. Epididymal fat pads from ND and HFD mice were sepa-\nrated into adipocyte and SVF fractions. SVF cells were plated onto \nglass coverslips and cultured overnight prior to fixation. Cells were \nstained with antibodies against F4/80 (left) and CD11c (middle) and \nimaged by confocal microscopy to identify surface markers to confirm \nthe presence of CD11c+ cells only in the SVF from HFD-fed animals. \nSimilar results were obtained for 3 independent sets of cultures.

ATMs from lean animals showed increased \nexpression of M2-specific genes Il10 (IL-10), Arg1 (arginase I), Mrc2 \n(mannose receptor, C type 2), Ym1/Chi3l3 (Ym1/chitinase 3\u2013like 3),  \nand Mgl1/2 (macrophage galactose N-acetyl-galactosamine\u2013spe-\ncific lectins 1 and 2) compared with the ATMs isolated from HFD \nmice (Figure 4A). In contrast, expression of proinflammatory \ngenes such as Tnfa and Nos2 was considerably lower in ND ATMs \ncompared with ATMs from obese animals (Figure 4B).\nAs macrophages make up only a portion of the stromal cells in \nadipose tissue, we examined expression of some of these genes in \nunsorted SVF isolates. Similar patterns of gene expression were \nseen in RNA prepared from SVF cells from lean and obese mice \n(Figure 4, C and D), with increased Ym1 and Il10 expression in ND \nmice and increased Tnfa and Nos2 expression in HFD mice.\nSince inflammatory macrophage recruitment into fat tissue \nappears to be partially dependent on CCR2 (10), we hypothesized \nthat ATMs in obese CCR2KO mice might retain properties of \nM2-polarized macrophages and thus evaluated gene expression \nin these cells. Indeed, ATMs isolated from obese CCR2KO mice \nexpressed alternatively activated macrophage markers at levels that \nwere similar to those seen in ATMs from lean mice. Furthermore, \nthese were significantly elevated compared with levels in ATMs \nfrom obese mice (Figure 4A).\nWe confirmed gene expression data by examining protein lev-\nels in the ATMs under study. Consistent with the RNA expression \ndata, Ym1 was increased in SVF samples from lean compared with \nobese mice (Figure 4E). Additionally, purification of CD11b+ ATMs \nfrom SVF samples indicated that Ym1 is predominantly expressed \nin ATMs compared with non-macrophage CD11b\u2013 cells.\nAnother characteristic of the alternative macrophage activa-\ntion state is increased arginase activity (15). Arginase activity was \nassessed in SVF and adipocyte samples from lean and obese mice. \nWhile the activity of this enzyme did not differ between the iso-\nlated adipocytes from lean and obese mice, arginase activity was \nsignificantly diminished in the SVF fraction after HFD exposure \n(Figure 4F). This indicates that the arginase/iNOS balance in \nATMs from lean animals is skewed toward an immunosuppres-\nsive state that changes to a proinflammatory state with obesity \n(elevated iNOS and repressed arginase activity).\nIL-10 protects adipocytes from the deleterious effects of TNF-\u03b1. The \nobservation that the expression of Il10 is higher in the SVF and \nATMs from lean compared with obese mice led us to examine the \neffects of the cytokine on adipocyte function. To explore the cellu-\nlar effects of IL-10, we first examined the expression of its receptor. \nThe IL-10 receptor \u03b1 (IL-10R\u03b1) was detected in adipose tissue by \nimmunoblotting (Figure 5A). Separation of the SVF from adipo-\ncytes in lean and obese animals indicated that the IL-10 receptor \nwas expressed primarily in adipocytes, with minimal expression \nin the SVF (Figure 5B). No significant differences were seen in \u2002\nIL-10R\u03b1 expression between lean and obese mice.\nWe next examined IL-10 signaling in differentiated 3T3-L1 adi-\npocytes. STAT3 phosphorylation by the IL-10 receptor has been \nshown to be required for its antiinflammatory effects (24). Treat-\nment of adipocytes with IL-10 led to the tyrosine phosphorylation \nof STAT3 within 5 minutes. This effect peaked at 10 minutes and \ndeclined thereafter (Figure 5C). As IL-10 as been shown to activate \nthe PI3K pathway via insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins (25), \nwe examined phosphorylation of Akt in response to IL-10. IL-10 \ntreatment of adipocytes produced the rapid serine phosphoryla-\ntion of Akt (Figure 5C).\nIL-10 has a variety of antiinflammatory effects in macrophages \nand other cell types that includes the antagonism of the actions of \nTNF-\u03b1 (26). To examine this in adipocytes, we first analyzed the \neffect of IL-10 on the secretion of the chemokine MCP-1, thought \nto be a major attractant for macrophages in states of obesity (9, \n11, 27). IL-10 treatment for 16 hours decreased MCP-1 secretion \nfrom adipocytes (Figure 6A). As reports suggest that IL-10 may \nmediate its antiinflammatory effects by antagonizing activation \nof NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated gene transcription (28), we examined the \neffects of IL-10 on TNF-\u03b1\u2013stimulated NF-\u03baB activity using an \nNF-\u03baB\u2013responsive luciferase reporter gene. While TNF-\u03b1 induced \nreporter gene expression, IL-10 had no effect upon this activation \n(data not shown). This is consistent with other reports that show \nthat IL-10 can alter the transcriptional rate of inflammatory genes \nindependent of NF-\u03baB activation (29).\nWe next examined the effects of IL-10 on insulin signal \ntransduction in adipocytes in concert with TNF-\u03b1. Treatment \nof cells with TNF-\u03b1 for 6 hours dramatically reduced the levels \nof glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) protein, with a smaller reduc-\ntion in the level of insulin receptor expression, similar to what has \nbeen reported previously (30). IL-10 pretreatment prevented the \nTNF-\u03b1\u2013induced downregulation of both proteins (Figure 6B). \nAdditionally, insulin-stimulated IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation \nwas decreased with TNF-\u03b1 treatment. This inhibitory effect was \nprevented by pretreatment with IL-10 (Figure 6C). IL-10 treat-\nment produced no significant changes in TNF-\u03b1\u2013stimulated IRS1 \nphosphorylation at Ser307, suggesting that the antagonism of \u2002\nTNF-\u03b1 action by IL-10 occurs either downstream of or in parallel \nto reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1.\nTo determine whether IL-10 protects adipocytes from the physi-\nological effects of TNF-\u03b1, we examined insulin-stimulated glucose \nuptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with and without IL-10 pretreatment. \nTreatment of cells with TNF-\u03b1 for 3 hours produced a significant, \n30%\u201340% inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Pre-\ntreatment of the cells with IL-10 for 24 hours blocked these acute \ninhibitory effects of TNF-\u03b1 (Figure 7A). Prolonged (72-hour), low-\ndose TNF-\u03b1 treatment increased basal glucose uptake but had no \neffect on insulin-stimulated levels, consistent with a dramatic \nupregulation of the glucose transporter GLUT1 under these con-\nFigure 3\nIncreased inflammatory gene expression in F4/80+CD11c+ ATMs. SVF \ncells were isolated from HFD-fed male C57BL/6 mice (n = 3) and stained \nfor F4/80 and CD11c.

IL-10 blocked these effects of TNF-\u03b1 and maintained \ncells in an insulin-sensitive state (Figure 7B). Moreover, insulin-\nstimulated glucose uptake was dramatically enhanced in cells \nchronically treated with IL-10 compared with untreated cells.\nDiscussion\nRecent data suggest that obesity may represent a state of chron-\nic, low-grade inflammation and that overnutrition is associated \nwith the infiltration of adipose tissue by inflammatory cells (2). \nAlthough the precise cell types involved in this process remain \nuncertain, evidence is mounting that implicates ATMs as a sig-\nnificant contributor to inflammation in obesity and a mediator \nof insulin resistance (3, 9, 32). Because the properties of ATMs are \nnot well characterized, we performed a detailed examination of \nATM subtypes and their gene expression in obese and lean mice. \nBased on the wide range of functions that macrophages display in \nnormal and inflamed tissues (33), we hypothesized that ATMs are \ndifferentially activated depending on the degree of adiposity and, \nfurther, that in addition to quantitative differences, qualitative \ndifferences exist between ATMs in lean and obese animals.\nWe report here that ATMs isolated from white adipose tissue \nfrom lean animals express hallmarks of polarization toward an \nalternatively activated state (M2), suggesting a potentially ben-\neficial function of these cells. M2 polarization has been described \nin tumor-associated macrophages and parasitic infections and is \nbelieved to regulate tissue repair and prevent excess inflammation \n(15, 34). The markers of M2-polarized macrophages are still being \ndescribed but include expression of the chitinase family member \nYm1, the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10, arginase, and surface \nlectins Mgl1 and Mgl2 (15, 23). The genes encoding all of these pro-\nteins were overexpressed in ATMs from lean compared with obese \nmice. Moreover, ATMs from obese CCR2KO mice, which display \nsignificantly lower inflammatory gene expression compared with \ntheir wild-type counterparts, express M2 markers at levels compa-\nrable to those in lean mice. This observation is consistent with the \nevidence that resident tissue macrophages in normal conditions \nare derived from CCR2\u2013 monocytes, while macrophages recruited \nto sites of inflammation are derived from CCR2+ monocytes (20).\nIn the current paradigm of macrophage polarization, the prop-\nerties of M2 macrophages contrast with the proinflammatory \nactivities of classically activated M1 macrophages. One important \ndifference between these polarization states involves the balance \nbetween arginase and iNOS activities. Arginase and iNOS both uti-\nlize l-arginine as a substrate. However, while iNOS generates reac-\ntive NO species with microbicidal and proinflammatory effects \nimportant in immune responses, arginase competes with iNOS for \narginine as a substrate and generates l-ornithine, an important \nprecursor for proline that enhances collagen biosynthesis (16). \nFigure 4\nIncreased expression of markers of alternatively activated (M2) macrophages in ATMs from lean ND-fed mice.

This balance in favor of arginase \nmay play a critical role in repressing the generation of NO and \nother reactive oxygen species by iNOS and thus maintain adipo-\ncyte function and promote tissue repair and remodeling.\nThe dramatic differences in IL-10 expression in lean compared \nwith obese ATMs imply an important role for this cytokine as a \nhomeostatic regulator in insulin sensitivity. Acute IL-10 infusion \nwas shown to improve insulin sensitivity in whole animals (35), \nsuggesting that this molecule may balance the effects of proin-\nflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1. In humans, circulating IL-10 \u2002\nlevels correlate with markers of improved insulin sensitivity (36), \nand IL-10 levels increase along with insulin sensitivity after exer-\ncise (37). Polymorphisms in the IL-10 promoter associated with low \nIL-10 expression are correlated with increased obesity and insulin \nresistance (38). Additionally, adiponectin has been shown to induce \u2002\nIL-10 expression in human leukocytes (39). Studies have also shown \nthat in obese humans and rodents, both adipocyte and SVF com-\npartments from adipose tissue are significant sources of IL-10 (40). \nAs levels of proinflammatory cytokines are increased in obesity, \nthis observation is consistent with the hypothesis that a balance \nexists between proinflammatory and antiinflamma-\ntory factors that governs adipocyte function.\nIn vitro studies described here show that IL-10 \nprotects against TNF-\u03b1\u2013dependent insulin resis-\ntance in adipocytes. The mechanism underlying \nthis effect remains uncertain. In macrophages, \u2002\nIL-10 attenuates TNF-\u03b1 inflammatory signals via \nactivation of STAT3 (24) and modulation of inflam-\nmatory gene transcription rates (29). We have not \nobserved changes in TNF-\u03b1\u2013stimulated NF-\u03baB acti-\nvation with IL-10 in adipocytes, although we did \nobserve increased PI3K signaling with the cytokine. \nThis observation agrees with previous reports that \nIL-10 can activate PI3K pathways via IRS (25) and \nsuggests a possible mechanism by which IL-10 can \nantagonize the deleterious effects of TNF-\u03b1 on \ninsulin signaling in adipocytes.\nObesity leads to a shift in ATM phenotype exem-\nplified by increased Tnfa and Nos2 expression, \nboth characteristically activated in classically acti-\nvated M1 macrophages (4\u20136). We have identified a \nunique subset of ATMs present only in obese animals that express \nF4/80+CD11b+CD11c+. These cells overexpress inflammatory \ngenes compared with F4/80+CD11b+CD11c\u2013 ATMs and are the \nmajor ATM population that accumulates in fat with diet-induced \nobesity. These studies indicate a previously uncharacterized diver-\nsity within the ATM population in obese mice that may have \nimportant functional consequences.\nCD11c is a marker for DCs, which primarily function in \nphagocytosis, immune surveillance, and antigen presentation. \nF4/80+CD11c+ DCs have been termed interstitial dendritic cells; \nthey were recently described in a kidney network that is believed \nto participate in immune surveillance (41). How these DCs par-\nticipate in inflammatory signals in adipose tissue is unknown. \nIt is possible that DC activation is critical to the coordination of \ninflammatory events within fat tissue. An important role for DCs \nin obese adipose tissue is supported by the decreased expression of \nMHC class II genes in CCR2KO mice relative to controls (10).

These data suggest that DC-coordinated immunity may be \ncrucial to the inflammatory events in adipose tissue that occur \nwith obesity. Why such DCs are activated and what antigens they \nrespond to is currently unknown.\nExamining ATM infiltration into adipose tissue in the context \nof monocyte and macrophage heterogeneity leads us to propose \na model for ATM biology that incorporates the diversity of these \ncells (Figure 8). In lean animals, resident macrophages are polar-\nized toward an M2 state (high IL-10 and arginase levels) derived \nfrom CCR2\u2013 monocytes that help maintain normal adipocyte \nfunction, perhaps by promoting tissue repair and angiogenesis in \nadipose tissue. Nutrient excess leads to adipocyte expansion, with \nincreased secretion of monocyte chemoattractants that recruit \ninflammatory type CCR2+ monocytes to fat, where they differen-\ntiate into M1-polarized activated macrophages and CD11c+ DCs. \nAlternatively activated M2 macrophages may be able to partially \nprevent the activation and accumulation of these classically acti-\nvated M1 macrophages (43, 44), and the secretion of IL-10 helps \nprotect adipocytes against the deleterious effects of TNF-\u03b1 and \nrelated cytokines. However, with increasing adiposity, increased \nproinflammatory signals, continued recruitment of M1-polarized \nCCR2+ monocytes, and accumulation of CD11c+ ATMs all con-\ntribute to overwhelm the protective effects of M2 macrophages, \nleading to a dominant role for M1-polarized, classically activated \nmacrophages that generate high TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and NO production. \nThis model explains observations in obese CCR2KO and Mcp1/\nCcl2-KO mice that retain a population of ATMs with decreased \ninflammatory capacity (9, 10). We suspect that these KOs are \ndeficient in the recruitment of CCR2+ monocytes during inflam-\nmation in fat tissue, while the trafficking of CCR2\u2013 monocytes \nwith M2 polarization remains intact. Studies aimed at determin-\ning whether enhancing M2 polarization in ATMs can block diet-\ninduced insulin resistance will be required in order to test this \nmodel. One limitation of the data leading to this model is that \nthey are largely based on flow cytometric analysis of isolated SVF \npopulations after collagenase digestion. This method of separa-\ntion is an efficient one but may not fully capture all stromal cells \nfrom adipose tissue (5).\nHow diet-induced obesity leads to a change from M2 to M1 \npolarization is currently unknown, but the mechanism is likely \nmultifactorial. Our data suggest that the MCP-1/CCR2 axis con-\ntributes to this polarization. We propose 2 potential models for \nthis qualitative change in ATM activation: (a) Obesity may lead \nto an increase in the level of Ly-6ChiCCR2+ circulating monocytes \nthat are primed for activation along an M1 polarization pattern. \nFactors such as MCP-1, TNF-\u03b1, and free fatty acids that activate \nTLR4 (45) may combine to influence this activation pattern as \nthese monocytes enter adipose tissue. This model is supported \nby observations that obesity is associated with changes in acti-\nvation state of circulating monocytes toward a more proinflam-\nmatory phenotype (46, 47). (b) Alternatively, obesity may change \nATMs in adipose tissue from an M2 toward an M1 phenotype. \nMacrophages are reported to have the potential to switch from \none polarization state to another depending upon environmental \nstimuli (48). However, this model depends upon a slow turnover \nof ATMs. Studies involving pulse labeling macrophages in vivo \nindicated that ATMs are largely replaced by 8 weeks in HFD-fed \nmice (42). Additionally, we have observed that the ATMs recruit-\ned to adipose tissue in HFD-fed mice overexpress Ccr2 and other \nproinflammatory mediators. These observations are consistent \nwith the first hypothesis, according to which obesity leads to the \nrecruitment of M1-polarized macrophages that gradually replace \nM2-polarized cells, which represents the default pathway of acti-\nvation under lean conditions.\nOur study frames ATM biology within the context of other \nknown models of inflammation and macrophage recruitment. It \nmay be possible to decrease inflammatory signals in adipose tis-\nsue by modifying ATMs to retain an M2 polarization or by con-\nverting M1 polarized macrophages to M2. Increasing IL-10 levels \nmay represent one mechanism through which this could occur, \nsince chronic IL-10 secretion can suppress classically activated M1 \nmacrophages (49). Future investigations will focus on identifying \nFigure 7\nIL-10 prevents the effects of TNF-\u03b1 on blocking insulin-\nstimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes.

Male C57BL/6 mice were rendered insulin resis-\ntant by feeding an HFD consisting of 45% of calories from fat (D12451; \nResearch Diets Inc.) starting at 8 weeks of age for 20 weeks or indicated \ntimes. Control mice were fed a standard diet consisting of 4.5% fat (5002; \nLabDiet). ob/obJ mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. \nCCR2KO mice on a C57BL/6 background were kindly provided by S. Kun-\nkel (University of Michigan). Animals were housed in a specific pathogen\u2013\nfree facility with a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle and given free access \nto food and water. All animal use was in compliance with the Institute of \nLaboratory Animal Research Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory \nAnimals and approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of \nAnimals at the University of Michigan.\nCell culture. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were propagated and differentiated into \nadipocytes as described previously (50). Adipocytes were used in experi-\nments 8\u201310 days after differentiation. Adherent SVF cells were cultured on \nplastic or glass coverslips in DMEM supplemented with 10% endotoxin-\nfree FBS. For signaling experiments, the cells were starved overnight in \n0.5% serum media prior to stimulation with IL-10. For chronic treatment \nwith IL-10 (20 ng/ml) and TNF-\u03b1 (3 ng/mL), adipocyte media was replaced \nwith fresh media every 24 hours.\nSVF isolation and ATM purification. Epididymal fat pads from male \nC57BL/6 mice fed an ND or HFD were excised and minced in PBS with \ncalcium chloride and 0.5% BSA. Tissue suspensions were centrifuged \nat 500 g for 5 minutes to remove erythrocytes and free leukocytes. Col-\nlagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to 1 mg/ml and incubated at 37\u00b0C \nfor 20 minutes with shaking. The cell suspension was filtered through a \u2002\n100-\u03bcm filter and then spun at 300 g for 5 minutes to separate floating \nadipocytes from the SVF pellet. To ensure proper isolation, adipocyte frac-\ntions were examined by microscopy before and after plating on plastic to \ndetect adherent cells. Samples were digested until adipocyte fractions were \nfree of adherent cells by these 2 quality-control methods to ensure recovery \nof the majority of the SVF population.\nFor cell culture, the pellet containing the SVF cells was resuspended in \ngrowth media for further experiments. For flow cytometry, the SVF pellet \nwas resuspended in 0.5 ml RBC Lysis Buffer (eBioscience) and incubated \nfor 5 minutes prior to resuspension in sorting buffer (PBS with 0.5% endo-\ntoxin-free FBS, 2 mM EDTA, and 25 mM HEPES) at a concentration of \n107 cells/ml. Cells were incubated with Fc Block (BD Biosciences) prior to \nstaining with conjugated antibodies for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C followed by 2 \nwashes in 10\u00d7 excess of sorting buffer. Cells were resuspended in sorting \nbuffer supplemented with DAPI and then analyzed by FACS (FACSAria; BD \nBiosciences). Viable cells were sorted directly into RNA lysis buffer for RNA \nextraction. ATMs were identified by coexpression of F4/80 and CD11b.\nIsolation of CD11b+ cells from SVF isolates was performed by magnetic \nimmunoaffinity isolation with anti-CD11b antibodies conjugated to \nmagnetic beads (MACS; Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were isolated using positive \nselection columns prior to preparation of whole-cell lysates.\nImmunofluorescence staining. For immunofluorescence, SVF cells were plat-\ned onto glass coverslips for 2 hours, and nonadherent cells were removed by \n3 washes with PBS.

In lean, insulin-sensitive states, ATMs are polar-\nized toward an M2 state with IL-10 and arginase expression. Early during HFD treatment, adipocytes undergo hypertrophy, releasing chemokines \nthat induce recruitment of M1-polarized ATMs with low IL-10 expression and increased iNOS and TNF-\u03b1 production. In these early stages of mild \nobesity with retained insulin sensitivity, M2-polarized resident ATMs are able to partially protect adipocytes from these inflammatory factors and \nmay block M1 polarization. With increased adiposity, recruited CCR2+ ATMs form crownlike structures (CLS) and overwhelm the protective effects \nof M2 macrophages, leading to a dominant role for TNF-\u03b1 and iNOS. These factors generate insulin resistance in adipocytes, activate JNK and \nNF-\u03baB, alter adipokine secretion, and lead to excess circulating levels of free fatty acids due to adipocyte lipolysis and impaired lipogenesis.\nresearch article\n \nThe Journal of Clinical Investigation\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 http://www.jci.org\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Volume 117\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Number 1\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 January 2007\t\n183\n10% formalin for 20 minutes at room temperature.
