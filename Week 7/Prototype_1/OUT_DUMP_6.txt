More-\nover, these cells fulfill homeostatic functions beyond defense, \nincluding tissue remodeling in ontogenesis and orchestration of \nmetabolic functions (1\u20133).\nCells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage are characterized by \nconsiderable diversity and plasticity. In tissues, mononuclear phago-\ncytes respond to environmental cues (e.g., microbial products, dam-\naged cells, activated lymphocytes) with the acquisition of distinct \nfunctional phenotypes. In response to various signals, macrophages \nmay undergo classical M1 activation (stimulated by TLR ligands and \nIFN-\u03b3) or alternative M2 activation (stimulated by IL-4/IL-13); these \nstates mirror the Th1\u2013Th2 polarization of T cells (2, 4).\nThe M1 phenotype is characterized by the expression of high \nlevels of proinflammatory cytokines, high production of reactive \nnitrogen and oxygen intermediates, promotion of Th1 response, \nand strong microbicidal and tumoricidal activity. In contrast, M2 \nmacrophages are considered to be involved in parasite containment \nand promotion of tissue remodeling and tumor progression and to \nhave immunoregulatory functions. They are characterized by effi-\ncient phagocytic activity, high expression of scavenging molecules, \nthe expression of mannose and galactose receptors, production of \nornithine and polyamines through the arginase pathway, and an \nIL-12loIL-10hiIL-1decoyRhiIL-1RAhi phenotype (1, 4). M1-M2 mac-\nrophages also are distinct in their chemokine expression profiles.\nSignals including IL-10, glucocorticoid hormones, molecules \nreleased from apoptotic cells, and immune complexes also pro-\nfoundly affect monocyte-macrophage function. These signals induce \nexpression of functional phenotypes that share selected properties \nwith M2 cells (e.g., high mannose and scavenger receptor expression), \nbut are distinct from them, for instance, in terms of the chemokine \nrepertoire. Operationally, we refer to these cells as M2 like (5).\nPlasticity and flexibility are key features of mononuclear \nphagocytes and of their activation states (2, 4, 6). The pheno-\ntype of polarized M1-M2 macrophages can, to some extent, be \nreversed in vitro and in vivo (7, 8). Moreover, pathology is fre-\nquently associated with dynamic changes in macrophage activa-\ntion, with classically activated M1 cells implicated in initiating \nand sustaining inflammation and M2 or M2-like cells associ-\nated with resolution or smoldering chronic inflammation (9). \nIt remains unclear whether the mechanism of these switches \ninvolves the recruitment of circulating precursors or the reeduca-\ntion of cells in situ. However, it is now apparent that specialized \nor polarized T cells (Th1, Th2, Tregs) that are key orchestrators \nof macrophage polarized activation (2) also exhibit previously \nunsuspected flexibility and plasticity (10).\nHere, we will focus on recent progress in understanding the \nmolecular basis underlying macrophage polarization, including \nsignaling pathways, transcription factors, and epigenetic regula-\ntion. Moreover, the dynamics and limitations in our understand-\ning of polarized macrophage activation in vivo will be discussed, \nfocusing on selected pathological conditions (for references to \npathology not discussed here, see Supplemental References; sup-\nplemental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/\nJCI59643DS1). Previous reviews also provide a framework for \nthis work (1\u20133, 6, 11).\nMolecular determinants of macrophage polarization\nA network of signaling molecules, transcription factors, epigenetic \nmechanisms, and posttranscriptional regulators underlies the dif-\nferent forms of macrophage activation. Canonical IRF/STAT sig-\nnaling pathways are activated by IFNs and TLR signaling to skew \nmacrophage function toward the M1 phenotype (via STAT1) or by \nIL-4 and IL-13 to skew toward the M2 phenotype (via STAT6) (3). \nM1 macrophages upregulate IRF5, which is essential for induction \nof cytokines (IL-12, IL-23, TNF) involved in eliciting Th1 and Th17 \nresponses (12). The IL-4 type I and type II receptors (1, 13) acti-\nvate Stat6, which in turn activates transcription of genes typical \nof M2 polarization, e.g., mannose receptor (Mrc1), resistin-like \u03b1 \u2002\nMacrophage plasticity and polarization:  \nin vivo veritas\nAntonio Sica1,2 and Alberto Mantovani1,3\n1Istituto Clinico Humanitas IRCCS, Rozzano, Italy. 2DiSCAFF, University of Piemonte Orientale A. Avogadro, Novara, Italy.  \n3Department of Translational Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.\nDiversity and plasticity are hallmarks of cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. In response to \nIFNs, Toll-like receptor engagement, or IL-4/IL-13 signaling, macrophages undergo M1 (classical) \nor M2 (alternative) activation, which represent extremes of a continuum in a universe of activation \nstates. Progress has now been made in defining the signaling pathways, transcriptional networks, \nand epigenetic mechanisms underlying M1-M2 or M2-like polarized activation. Functional skew-\ning of mononuclear phagocytes occurs in vivo under physiological conditions (e.g., ontogenesis \nand pregnancy) and in pathology (allergic and chronic inflammation, tissue repair, infection, and \ncancer). However, in selected preclinical and clinical conditions, coexistence of cells in different activation states \nand unique or mixed phenotypes have been observed, a reflection of dynamic changes and complex tissue-derived \nsignals. The identification of mechanisms and molecules associated with macrophage plasticity and polarized acti-\nvation provides a basis for macrophage-centered diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.\nConflict of interest: Antonio Sica has received grant support from Johnson & \nJohnson.\nCitation for this article: J Clin Invest. 2012;122(3):787\u2013795. doi:10.1172/JCI59643.\nscience in medicine\n788 \nThe Journal of Clinical Investigation\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 http://www.jci.org\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Volume 122\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Number 3\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 March 2012\n(Retnla, Fizz1), and chitinase 3\u2013like 3 (Chi3l3, Ym1) (14). IL-10 acti-\nvates STAT3-mediated expression of genes (Il10, Tgfb1, Mrc1) asso-\nciated with an M2-like phenotype (4, 15, 16).\nSTAT-mediated activation of macrophages is regulated by mem-\nbers of the SOCS family. IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3, the latter in concert with \nTLR stimulation, upregulate SOCS1 and SOCS3, which in turn \ninhibit the action of STAT1 and STAT3, respectively (17, 18).\nDownstream of, or in parallel with, the IRF/STAT/SOCS pathway, \na panel of transcription factors orchestrates polarized macrophage \nactivation. The nuclear receptors PPAR\u03b3 (19) and PPAR\u03b4 (20, 21) con-\ntrol distinct subsets of genes associated with M2 macrophage activa-\ntion and oxidative metabolism (Figure 1). Interestingly, STAT6 coor-\ndinates and synergizes with both PPAR\u03b3 (22) and Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 \u2002\n(KLF4), a member of a family of proteins that contribute to macro-\nphage function (23, 24). KLF4 cooperates with Stat6 to induce M2 \ngenes (Arg-1, Mrc1, Fizz1, PPAR\u03b3) and inhibit M1 genes (TNFa, Cox-2, \u2002\nCCL5, iNOS) via sequestration of coactivators required for NF-\u03baB acti-\nvation. KLF2 regulates macrophage activation by inhibiting NF-\u03baB/\u2002\nHIF-1\u03b1 activities (25). IL-4 also induces c-Myc activity in human \nmacrophages (26), which controls genes of M2 activation (Scarb1, \nAlox15, and Mrc1) as well as STAT6 and PPAR\u03b3 activation (26).\nTLR engagement leads to NF-\u03baB activation and production of \ninflammatory mediators (27) associated with M1 macrophages. \nHowever, NF-\u03baB activation also activates a genetic program essen-\ntial for resolution of inflammation (28) and for M2 polarization of \ntumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) (29). Moreover, induction of \np50 NF-\u03baB homodimers is essential for M2 polarization in vitro and \nin vivo (30). The hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 are \nexpressed differentially in M1- and M2-polarized macrophages (31) \nand regulate inducible NOS2 (M1) and arginase 1 (M2), respectively.\nFigure 1\nMechanisms of macrophage polarization. The major pathways of macrophage polarization are outlined. The crosstalk between the M1-M2 macro-\nphage\u2013polarizing pathways is also indicated. The balance between activation of STAT1 and STAT3/STAT6 finely regulates macrophage polariza-\ntion and activity. A predominance of NF-\u03baB and STAT1 activation promotes M1 macrophage polarization, resulting in cytotoxic and inflammatory \nfunctions. In contrast, a predominance of STAT3 and STAT6 activation results in M2 macrophage polarization, associated with immune suppres-\nsion and tumor progression. PPAR\u03b3 and PPAR\u03b4 control distinct aspects of M2 macrophage activation and oxidative metabolism. KLF4 and KLF2 \nparticipate in the promotion of M2 macrophage functions by cooperating with STAT6 and suppressing the NF-\u03baB/HIF-1\u03b1\u2013dependent transcription, \nrespectively. IL-4\u2013induced c-Myc activity controls a subset of M2-associated genes. IL-4 also induces the M2-polarizing Jmjd3-IRF4 axis to inhibit \nIRF5-mediated M1 polarization. IL-10 promotes M2 polarization through the induction of p50 NF-\u03baB homodimer, c-Maf, and STAT3 activities.\nscience in medicine\n \nThe Journal of Clinical Investigation\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 http://www.jci.org\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Volume 122\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Number 3\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 March 2012\t\n789\nEpigenetic changes and noncoding RNAs also participate \nin directing macrophage polarization (32\u201334). IL-4 induces \nupregulation of the histone demethylase JMJD3 in mouse macro-\nphages, which alters chromatin modifications to promote expres-\nsion of M2 genes and inhibit M1 genes. miR-155 was recently iden-\ntified as targeting the IL-13R\u03b11 subunit, thus decreasing a set of \nM2 genes in human macrophages (35).\nPathology\nResolution of inflammation and repair. Remodeling and repair occur \ndynamically during ontogenesis and inflammation, and these pro-\ncesses are orchestrated by macrophages.\nMacrophages undergo dynamic changes during different phases \nof wound healing. M1-polarized macrophages mediate tissue dam-\nage and initiate inflammatory responses (1, 2). During the early \nstages of the repair response after wounding the skin, infiltrating \nmacrophages have an M2 phenotype and their depletion inhibits \nthe formation of a highly vascularized, cellular granulation tissue \nand of scar tissues (36). Under these conditions, the removal of \napoptotic cells (efferocytosis) (37, 38) and the presence of TGF-\u03b2 \u2002\n(39) may skew macrophage function, though demonstration of \nactual in vivo relevance of these findings is lacking.\nIn a peritoneal model of inflammation, resolution phase macro-\nphages expressed a unique mixed M1-M2 phenotype, and cAMP \nwas essential to restrain M1 activation (40). In humans, chronic \nvenous ulcers (CVU) represent a failure to resolve a chronic inflam-\nmatory condition (41). Correlative analysis in patients and a \nmouse model suggested that in CVU the infiltrating macrophages \nfail to switch from an M1 to an M2 phenotype (41). Notably, iron \nmetabolism is differentially regulated in polarized macrophages \n(42). In CVU, the iron overload in macrophages sustained their M1 \nactivation, leading to ROS-mediated DNA damage, fibroblast cel-\nlular senescence, and defective tissue repair (41). It is tempting to \nspeculate that similar mechanisms may underlie M2 functions in \npatients with severe burns, where hemorrhage and tissue damage, \nalong with the high release of iron by M2 macrophages (42), may \nresult in high iron tissue levels (43).\nDynamic changes in the phenotype of recruited mononuclear \nphagocytes have been observed in models of ischemic heart disease \n(44), suggesting that this is a general feature of the natural history of \nrepair processes. In a murine model of hind limb ischemia, haplode-\nficiency of the oxygen sensor prolyl-hydroxylase PHD2 induced the \ncanonical NF-\u03baB pathway in macrophages, which promoted their \nM2 polarization and proarteriogenic phenotype (45). This obser-\nvation may suggest a functional link between oxygen deprivation, \nas occurring in wounds and tumors, and progressive induction of \nproarteriogenic M2 macrophages. Thus, although the macrophage \nphenotype in resolution need not be a phenocopy of in vitro\u2013gener-\nated M2 cells, preclinical and clinical evidence support the long-held \nview of a key role of polarized macrophages in tissue repair.\nIn a model of retinal neuropathy, mononuclear phagocyte infil-\ntration generates a neuroprotective microenvironment promot-\ning retinal progenitor cell survival (46). The interplay of polarized \nmacrophages with stem and progenitor cells is likely a key com-\nponent of their role in repair and remodeling, although the actual \ntissue-protective significance of polarized macrophages in degen-\nerative diseases and their involvement with stem and progenitor \ncells remain to be determined (see Supplemental References).\nMacrophage activation has been found in autoimmune and \ninflammatory diseases and in particular in lupus nephritis \n(47). In a murine model of SLE, proinflammatory activation \nof macrophages was sustained by Notch signaling (48). Con-\nversely, the acute phase protein serum amyloid P (SAP) skewed \nmacrophages toward an antiinflammatory M2-like phenotype, \nthus alleviating lupus nephritis (49). In RA, a major source of \nM1 cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-12p70) (50) in the joints are \nthe synovial macrophages, whose number correlate with the \ninflammatory disease activity (51). On this basis, PPAR\u03b4 and \nPPAR\u03b3 are considered potential disease-modifying drugs for RA \n(52, 53). In a murine model of experimental colitis, recruitment \nof CCL11-expressing Ly6ChiCCR2+ inflammatory monocytes \ninto the colon correlates with eosinophil infiltration and his-\ntopathology (54).\nInfection\nBacteria. M1 macrophages are generally considered responsible for \nresistance against intracellular pathogens and characterize infec-\ntion with Listeria monocytogenes (55), Salmonella typhi, and Salmo-\nnella typhimurium (56), as well as the early phases of infection with \nMycobacterium tuberculosis (57), Mycobacterium ulcerans, and Myco-\nbacterium avium (58, 59). Uncontrolled M1 inflammation associ-\nated with acute infections with E. coli or Streptococcus sp. causes \ngastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, neonatal meningitis, and \nsepsis (60). The M1-M2 switch observed during the transition \nfrom acute to chronic infection may provide protection against \noverwhelming uncontrolled inflammation; however, a phenotype \nswitch can also favor pathogens that have evolved strategies to \ninterfere with M1-associated killing (58, 61\u201364).\nChronic inflammation and granuloma formation are char-\nacterized by the presence of macrophages with an epithelial \nmorphology and by macrophage homotypic fusion with the \nformation of multinucleated giant cells (MNG) (65). IL-4\u2013medi-\nated upregulation of E-cadherin, which engages in intercellular \nhomotypic adhesion, is likely to underlie MNG formation. STAT6 \ndrives expression of E-cadherin and DC transmembrane protein \n(DC-STAMP; ref. 66) during MNG generation. The actual func-\ntion and role of MNG remain elusive.\nParasites. In experimental and human parasite infections, macro-\nphages generally undergo a dynamic switch toward M2 polariza-\ntion (61, 67). The early and late phases of Taenia crassiceps infection \nare characterized by Th1-driven M1 and Th2-driven IL-4\u2013mediat-\ned M2 polarization of macrophages, respectively (11, 68). A simi-\nlar M1-M2 switch has been reported during Schistosoma mansoni \nand Trypanosoma congolense infection (69). In the chronic stage of \nT. crassiceps infection, the p50 NF-\u03baB subunit (see above) promotes \nprotective M2 macrophage polarization associated with decreased \nparasite burden (30).\nThe recurrent association of M2 polarization with parasite infec-\ntions does not necessarily imply a generalized relevance in patho-\ngenesis. For instance, lineage-selective ablation of the IL-4\u03b1 chain \ncauses a dramatic increase in susceptibility to S. mansoni, but has \nno discernible effect on Nippostrongylus infection (70).\nViral infections. Polarized activation of macrophages has been \nassociated with virus infection (e.g., HIV, Kaposi sarcoma\u2013associ-\nated herpes virus, and others; see Supplemental References), and \nthis polarization may be important in containing and limiting \ntissue damage. In particular, during severe respiratory syncytial \nvirus\u2013induced (RSV-induced) bronchiolitis, IL-4R\u03b1/STAT6-\ndependent M2 macrophage differentiation reduces inflammation \nand epithelial damage in lungs (71).\nscience in medicine\n790 \nThe Journal of Clinical Investigation\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 http://www.jci.org\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Volume 122\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Number 3\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 March 2012\nAllergy\nAllergy is driven by Th2 cells and products and is associated with \nM2 polarization of macrophages (72, 73). IL-4\u2013inducible che-\nmokines acting on CCR4 (e.g., CCL22) have also been reported \nto promote skewing of macrophage function (74). Evidence now \nindicates that chitin- and arginase-dependent M2 pathways play \nan active role in pathogenesis (75, 76). Asthma is associated with \ntissue remodeling, including collagen deposition and goblet cell \nhyperplasia. IL-4\u2013driven M2 polarization is likely to play a key role \nas an orchestrator of these processes (77).\nAllergy represents a paradigm for IL-4/IL-13\u2013driven type 2 \ninflammation. However, there is evidence that the inflamma-\nsome/IL-1/Th17 pathway can also drive allergic inflammation \n(78, 79). Moreover, a Th1-associated cytokine, IL-18, has also \nbeen implicated in allergic inflammation (80). It is therefore per-\nhaps not surprising that mixed phenotype macrophages have \nbeen observed (81).\nCancer\nCancer-related inflammation is characterized by the recruitment \nof cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage to tumor tissues \n(2, 82, 83), which also condition the premetastatic niche, to \nfavor secondary localization of cancer. Classically activated M1-\npolarized macrophages have the potential to exhibit antitumor \nactivity and to elicit tumor tissue disruption (4). At least in some \nmodels of carcinogenesis in the mouse, progression is associated \nwith a phenotype switch from M1 to M2 (84). Th1-driven mac-\nrophage activation was found to mediate elimination of senes-\ncent hepatocytes, which drive subsequent carcinogenesis (85). \nIt is therefore likely that classically activated M1 macrophages \ncontribute to the T cell\u2013mediated elimination and equilibrium \nphases during tumor progression (86).\nAt later stages of progression in mice and humans, TAMs gener-\nally have an M2-like phenotype with low IL-12 expression, high IL-10 \u2002\nexpression, and low tumoricidal activity and promotion of tissue \nremodeling and angiogenesis. TAM infiltration is generally associ-\nated with poor prognosis, as shown in Hodgkin disease, glioma, chol-\nangiocarcinoma, and breast carcinoma (87, 88). However, TAMs with \nvarious functional states can coexist in the same tumor (2, 89). Vari-\nous pathways orchestrate the protumor function of myelomonocytic \ncells, including tumor-derived and host-derived signals (2). Lympho-\ncytes are key orchestrators of TAM function (2), but pathways differ \nin tumors originating in different organs. For instance, skewing of \nmacrophage function was found to be mediated by IL-4\u2013producing \nTh2 cells in skin (90, 91) and by antibody-producing B cells in breast \ncarcinogenesis (92, 93). B1 cells can promote cancer progression in \nthe skin (5), and fibroblasts can also contribute to circuits driving \nmacrophage polarization and tumor promotion (94).\nTumor cell products, including extracellular matrix compo-\nnents, IL-10, CSF-1, and chemokines (CCL2, CCL18, CCL17, and \nCXCL4), set macrophages in an M2-like, cancer-promoting mode \n(82, 95\u201397). TAMs can also interact with and promote the tumori-\ngenicity of cancer stem cells (CSCs) via production of the milk-fat \nglobule-epidermal growth factor\u2013VIII (MFG-E8) by activation of \nthe STAT3 and sonic hedgehog pathways (98).\nThe identification of the various cellular and molecular path-\nways that participate in inflammation in different human cancers \nwill be required to translate our understanding of cancer-related \ninflammation to meaningful therapeutic advances.\nObesity and metabolism\nObesity-associated insulin resistance, diabetes, and metabolic \nsyndrome are sustained by chronic subclinical inflammation \n(99). Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are a major component \nTable 1\nPrototypic therapeutic strategies targeting macrophage polarization\nFunction \nTherapeutic agent \nDisease\nRecruitment\t\nAnti\u2013CSF-1 (Ab and antisense-ODN)\t\nBreast cancer\n\t\nAnti-CCL2 (Ab)\t\nBreast, prostate cancer\n\t\nCCL2 inhibitor (bindarit)\t\nMelanoma and vascular pathology\n\t\nfms-tyrosine kinase inhibitors\t\nAcute myeloid leukemia and bone metastasis\nDepletion\t\nTrabectedin\t\nLiposarcoma\nSwitch to M1\t\nIFN-\u03b3\t\nAtopic dermatitis; ovarian cancer\n\t\nTLR9 agonist (CpG-ODN)\t\nAsthma\n\t\nCpG-ODN + anti\u2013IL-10\t\nBreast cancer\n\t\nAnti-CD40 (agonist)\t\nPancreatic cancer\n\t\nSTAT3 inhibitors\t\nBreast cancer; melanoma\n\t\nSTAT6 inhibitors\t\nBreast cancer; T. crassiceps (e.s.)\n\t\np50 NF-\u03baB inhibitors\t\nT. congolense; fibrosarcoma, melanoma\n\t\nIKK\u03b2 inhibitors\t\nOvarian cancer\n\t\nImidazoquinolines (TLR7/8 agonists)\t\nSCC, cutaneous B cell lymphomas\n\t\nZoledronic acid\t\nBreast cancer\nInhibition of M1 pathways\t\nCD40 (antagonist)\t\nAtherosclerosis\nInhibition of M2 pathways\t\nIL-33 (antagonist)\t\nAirway inflammation\nInduction of M2 pathways\t\nPPAR\u03b3 agonists (thiazolidinediones)\t\nDiabetes; atherosclerosis\n\t\nNonthiazolidinedione tyrosine-based\t\n\t\nPPAR\u03b3 ligand (GW7845)\t\nAtherosclerosis\n\t\nStatin\t\nGlomerulonephritis\nODN, oligodeoxyribonucleotides; IKK\u03b2, IKK\u03b2 subunit of I\u03baB kinase (IKK); e.s., early stage of infection.

In obese subjects and mice, adipocytes release media-\ntors such as CCL2, TNF, or free fatty acids, which promote the \nrecruitment and activation of ATMs (100\u2013102). In turn, ATM-pro-\nduced inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2) counteract \nthe insulin-sensitizing action of adiponectin and leptin, leading to \ninsulin resistance. ATM infiltration correlates with the degree of \nobesity (101\u2013103). ATM accumulation is orchestrated by selected \nchemokines and their receptors (e.g., CCL2/CCR2 or CCL5/CCR5) \n(101, 103, 104) and by the macrophage-derived apoptosis inhibitor \nof macrophages (AIM) (105).\nATMs from obese mice and humans are polarized toward an \nM1 phenotype, with upregulation of TNF and iNOS. In con-\ntrast \u201clean\u201d ATMs express high levels of M2 genes, including \nIL-10, Ym1, and Arginase 1 (106, 107). Weight loss is associ-\nated with a shift back to an M2-like phenotype. However, evi-\ndence indicates that the ATM population in obese patients is \ndiverse, with a minor F4/80+CD11b+CD11c\u2013, IL-10hi, M2-like \npopulation coexisting with M1 cells (106). Moreover, analysis \nof CD11c+ ATMs from obese mice revealed a mixed profile of \nseveral M1-M2 gene transcripts (108). Weight loss is associ-\nated with an increase in F4/80+CD11c\u2013CD301+ M2-like macro-\nphages, which promote lipolysis (109).\nProgress has been made in defining the molecular pathways that \naccount for polarization of ATMs (19, 20, 24, 110, 111) in obesity. \nMice with macrophage-selective genetic inactivation of PPAR\u03b3, \nPPAR\u03b4, and KLF4 show inhibition of obesity-induced insulin \nresistance (19, 20, 24, 106, 110), although these results may be \nstrain specific (112). The adipose tissue of obese subjects shows a \nmarked reduction in KLF4 levels. Nguyen et al. have recently dem-\nonstrated that adaptation to lower temperatures (thermogenesis) \nis associated with polarization of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and \nwhite adipose tissue (WAT) macrophages to the alternative state \n(M2), with increased expression of thermogenic genes (Ppargc1 \nand Ucp1) (113). In response to cold, IL-4\u2013driven M2 macrophages \nrelease noradrenaline in BAT and WAT, which coordinates fatty \nacid mobilization and energy expenditure (113). Although further \nwork is needed to dissect the diversity and dynamics of ATMs, \u2002\nM2-like cells in nonobese individuals are likely involved in main-\ntaining adipose tissue homeostasis, preventing inflammation, and \npromoting insulin sensitivity. In contrast, M1-like ATMs drive \nobesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance (107). The \nrole of macrophages in obesity and associated disorders underlines \na homeostatic function of macrophages in metabolism as cells \ncapable of reorienting their own metabolic activity and as orches-\ntrators of general metabolism.\nFigure 2\nSchematic representation of macrophage plasticity and polarization in pathology. Dynamic changes occur over time with evolution of pathology: \nfor instance, a switch from M1 to M2 macrophage polarization characterizes the transition from early to chronic phases of infection. Moreover, \nmixed phenotypes or populations with different phenotypes can coexist.

In addition, therapeutic \napproaches not originally designed as macrophage oriented or spe-\ncific have been found to affect macrophage activation and polar-\nization. These off-target examples provide insights and lessons for \nthe development of more specifically directed approaches.\nRecruitment is a key determinant sustaining macrophage \nnumbers at sites of inflammation and immunity. Monocyte \nattractants include members of the chemokine superfamily, \nCCL2/MCP-1 in particular, and growth factors interacting with \ntyrosine kinase receptors CSF-1 and VEGF (83, 114, 115). CSF-1 \nreceptor (c-fms) kinase inhibitors have been generated, and these \nmolecules exhibit antiangiogenic and antimetastatic activity in \nacute myeloid leukemia and melanoma models (116, 117). Che-\nmokines and CSF-1 are more than monocyte attractants; they \nalso promote M2-like skewing of macrophage function (97, \n118, 119). Antibodies directed against CCL2/CCR2 have proven \nactive in prostate and breast cancer (83, 120). A CCL2 inhibitor \n(bindarit) has proven active in preclinical models of cancer and \nvascular pathology, resulting in inhibition of monocyte recruit-\nment (121); this agent is now undergoing evaluation for clinical \nuse. Anti\u2013CSF-1 antibodies and antisense oligonucleotides sup-\npress macrophage infiltration and xenograft mammary tumor \ngrowth in mice (122\u2013124). VEGF inhibitors can decrease macro-\nphage recruitment, and this effect may contribute to their anti-\nangiogenic activity (125). In contrast, in response to neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy, altered composition in the immune microenvi-\nronment was found in breast cancer patients, with increased per-\ncentage of infiltrating myeloid cells (126).\nRecent results suggest that in situ, proliferation is a key deter-\nminant of macrophage accumulation during inflammation in \nthe peritoneum and lungs (127, 128). In the latter, IL-4 was found \nto sustain macrophage proliferation. If proliferation is indeed a \nmajor general mechanism sustaining macrophage accumulation, \nthis may suggest novel approaches to reduce macrophage numbers \nin situ and a different perspective for anti\u2013CSF-1/CSF-1R strate-\ngies. However, determining the actual significance of macrophage \nproliferation in humans, in particular in Th2-mediated inflamma-\ntion, is a major stumbling block in this perspective.\nReorienting and reshaping deranged macrophage polarization \nis the holy grail of macrophage therapeutic targeting (129). Polar-\nized phenotypes are reversible in vitro and in vivo (29, 130\u2013132). \nIn proof of concept and in a large clinical study in ovarian cancer \npatients, IFN-\u03b3 was found to activate TAM tumoricidal activity, \ninducing a phenotype switch with unequivocal evidence of clinical \nresponses (133). In a model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, \nCD40 agonist antibodies promoted a remarkable antitumor effect \nand induced high expression of M1 markers (MHC class II and \nCD86) in macrophages (132).\nModulation of macrophage function is an off-target effect for \na number of diverse therapeutic agents. PPAR\u03b3 agonists (thia-\nzolidinediones) have long been used in the treatment of diabetes. \nThe evidence linking PPAR\u03b3 to M2 polarization and hence to the \nhomeostatic role of ATMs sheds fresh new light on their mode \nof action. Preclinical evidence suggests that PPAR\u03b3 promotes \u2002\nM2-like polarization and homeostatic metabolic function in ATMs \nand that alteration of this function is a key pathogenic feature in \ndiabetes (134\u2013136). Other therapeutic strategies that have been \nreported to affect macrophage polarization include zoledronic \nacid (an agent used for preventing recurrence of breast cancer bone \nmetastasis), statins (137), trabectedin (138) and TLR ligands (e.g., \nimiquimod and CpG) (see also Supplemental References).\nConcluding remarks\nProgress has been made in defining the molecular networks \nunderlying polarized activation of macrophages. Molecular \ndeterminants of M1 versus M2 polarization include members \nof the PPAR, KLF, IRF, STAT, NF-\u03baB, and HIF families. Regu-\nlation of skewing also involves epigenetic modifications with \ninvolvement of histone methylation and acetylation. miRNAs \nhave emerged as regulators of phagocyte activation and function \n(34, 139), but their role in macrophage polarization needs to be \nfurther defined.\nFunctional polarization has now been observed in vivo under \nphysiological and pathological conditions. The former include \nembryogenesis and pregnancy and normal maintenance of select-\ned tissues, such as testis and adipose. The latter include chronic \ninflammation and tissue repair, metabolic and vascular disorders, \ninfection, and cancer. There is now evidence that macrophages are \na key component of all of these processes (Figure 2).\nUnder condition such as parasite infections, allergy, and many \ncancers, the functional phenotypes of macrophages in vivo mirror \nthose of canonical M1-M2 or M2-like polarized states as defined \nin vitro. However, in a number of pathological conditions, such as \nneurodegenerative disorders (140), this is not the case, and macro-\nphage populations express mixed or unique phenotypes. The con-\ntribution of coexisting cells with different phenotypes, the impact \nof dynamic changes during disease evolution, and the molecular \nnetworks orchestrating these mixed phenotypes need to be carefully \ndissected on a case-by-case basis. Indeed, this macrophage plasticity \ncalls for in-depth analysis in different pathological conditions.\nTherapeutic macrophage targeting is in its infancy. Selected \nclinically approved therapeutic strategies, such as use of PPAR\u03b3 \ninhibitors, statins, zolendronic acid, and preventive activities such \nas weight loss may have an impact on the functional status of \nmacrophages; however, the extent to which their effect on mac-\nrophages explains their clinical efficacy remains to be defined. \nThe identification of mechanisms and molecules associated with \nmacrophage plasticity and polarized activation provides a basis for \nmacrophage-centered diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by Associazione Italiana Ricerca sul Can-\ncro (AIRC), Italy; Fondazione Cariplo, Italy; Ministero Universit\u00e0 \nRicerca (MIUR) e Salute; and by the European Commission (ERC \nProject No. 233417 HIIS to AM).\nAddress correspondence to: Antonio Sica, IRCCS Istituto Clinico \nHumanitas, via Manzoni 113, 20089 Rozzano, Milan, Italy.

Synaptic plasticity specifically refers to the\nactivity-dependent modification of the strength or efficacy\nof synaptic transmission at preexisting synapses, and for\nover a century has been proposed to play a central role in\nthe capacity of the brain to incorporate transient experi-\nences into persistent memory traces. Synaptic plasticity is\nalso thought to play key roles in the early development of\nneural circuitry and evidence is accumulating that impair-\nments in synaptic plasticity mechanisms contribute to\nseveral prominent neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, eluci-\ndating the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying\nsynaptic plasticity in any number of different brain regions\nis critical for understanding the neural basis of many\naspects of normal and pathological brain function.\nGiven the diversity of the functions ascribed to synaptic\nplasticity, it is not surprising that many forms and\nmechanisms of synaptic plasticity have been described.\nSynaptic transmission can be either enhanced or depressed\nby activity, and these changes span temporal domains\nranging from milliseconds to hours, days, and presumably\neven longer. Furthermore, virtually all excitatory synapses\nin the mammalian brain simultaneously express a number\nof different forms of synaptic plasticity. Here, we attempt to\nprovide a broad overview of the mechanisms of the most\nprominent\nforms\nof\nplasticity\nobserved\nat\nexcitatory\nsynapses in the mammalian brain. After briefly reviewing\nshort-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity, we will emphasize\ncurrent understanding of the cellular mechanisms and\npossible functions of the class of phenomena commonly\ntermed long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depres-\nsion (LTD).\nSHORT-TERM SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY\nNumerous forms of short-term synaptic plasticity, lasting\non the order of milliseconds to several minutes, have been\nobserved at virtually every synapse examined in organisms\nranging from simple invertebrates to mammals (Zucker and\nRegehr, 2002). These are thought to play important roles in\nshort-term adaptations to sensory inputs, transient changes\nin behavioral states, and short-lasting forms of memory.\nMost forms of short-term synaptic plasticity are triggered\nby short bursts of activity causing a transient accumulation\nof calcium in presynaptic nerve terminals. This increase in\npresynaptic\ncalcium\nin\nturn\ncauses\nchanges\nin\nthe\nprobability of neurotransmitter release by directly modify-\ning the biochemical processes that underlie the exocytosis\nof synaptic vesicles.\nPaired-Pulse Facilitation and Depression\nWhen two stimuli are delivered within a short interval, the\nresponse to the second stimulus can be either enhanced or\nReceived 5 June 2007; revised 1 August 2007; accepted 1 August 2007\n*Correspondence: Dr RC Malenka, Department of Psychiatry, Stanford\nMedical Center, 1201 Welch Rd., Rm.

Paired-pulse\ndepression is commonly observed at all synapses at short\n(less than 20 ms) interstimulus intervals, and most probably\nresults from inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium or\ncalcium channels or from a transient depletion of the\nrelease-ready pool of vesicles docked at the presynaptic\nterminal. Many synapses exhibit paired-pulse facilitation at\nlonger\ninterstimulus\nintervals\n(20\u2013500 ms).\nA\nsimple\nexplanation for this phenomenon is that the residual\ncalcium left over from the invasion of the first action\npotential contributes to additional release during the second\nstimulation, but it is likely that additional mechanisms are\ninvolved. These may involve activation of protein kinases\nthat modulate the activity of presynaptic phosphoproteins.\nFor example, mice in which the presynaptic phosphoprotein\nsynapsin (De Camilli et al, 1990) has been knocked out,\nexhibit abnormal short-term plasticity (Rosahl et al, 1993,\n1995).\nWhether a synapse exhibits paired-pulse facilitation or\ndepression depends on the recent history of activation of\nthe synapse. Because these forms of plasticity largely result\nfrom changes in the probability of transmitter release (p),\nsynapses that begin with a very high p tend to depress their\nresponse to the second pulse (Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997).\nIn contrast, synapses with a low initial p normally exhibit an\nincrease in p in response to the second stimulus. Consistent\nwith this idea, manipulations that decrease p (eg, activation\nof presynaptic autoreceptors) almost always cause an\nincrease in the magnitude of paired-pulse facilitation, or\neven a conversion of paired-pulse depression to facilitation.\nThus, the same synapse can display either facilitation or\ndepression, depending on its recent history of activation\nand modulation.\nFacilitation and Depression Following Trains of\nStimuli\nLonger-lasting forms of plasticity are observed following\nrepetitive or tetanic stimulation of synapses with prolonged\n(approximately 200 ms to 5 s) trains of stimulation applied\nat high frequencies (10\u2013200 Hz) (Zucker and Regehr, 2002).\nAugmentation and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) describe\nan enhancement of transmitter release lasting from seconds\n(augmentation) to several minutes (PTP). They also involve\nan increase in the probability of transmitter release in\nresponse to an action potential due, in large part, to the\nbuildup\nof\ncalcium\nconcentration\nin\nthe\npresynaptic\nterminal during the stimulus trains. This residual calcium\nmay combine with the calcium influx elicited by the\nsubsequent single action potential to enhance directly the\nrelease of neurotransmitter, or may lead to biochemical\nmodifications of proteins in the presynaptic terminal\n(Magleby and Zengel, 1982; Zucker and Regehr, 2002).\nAt some synapses, repetitive activation leads to depres-\nsion that can last for several seconds or even minutes (Betz,\n1970; Zucker and Regehr, 2002). As in paired-pulse\ndepression, this generally occurs in synapses that exhibit a\nhigh probability of release, and is thought to result, at least\nin part, from a transient depletion of the release-ready pool\nof synaptic vesicles. The decrease in synaptic strength can\nalso arise from the release of modulatory substances from\nthe activated presynaptic terminals, postsynaptic cells, or\neven neighboring cells, initiating a signaling cascade that\nleads to inhibition of the presynaptic release machinery.\nFinally, a postsynaptic mechanism of short-term plasticity\nmay involve desensitization of ligand-gated receptors,\nmaking the target neuron less sensitive to neurotransmitter.\nA key characteristic of depression at many synapses is use\ndependence. Higher levels of transmission are associated\nwith larger depression, and reduction of baseline transmis-\nsion (eg, by reducing external calcium concentration)\nrelieves depression.\nModulation of Transmission by Presynaptic\nReceptors\nMost presynaptic terminals possess a number of different\ntypes of metabotropic G-protein-coupled receptors, as well\nas ionotropic receptors (MacDermott et al, 1999). The\nprobability of transmitter release, a significant factor in\ndefining synaptic strength, is controlled in part by the\noccupancy of these receptors, which in turn is set by the\nextracellular concentrations of their agonists. In some cases,\ntonic levels of endogenous ligands are sufficient to partially\nactivate the receptors. Nonetheless, synaptic activity can\nfurther increase receptor occupancy by transiently elevating\nthe concentration of various presynaptic neuromodulators\n(Thompson et al, 1993; Miller, 1998). Depending on their\nspecific properties, activation of these receptors can either\nenhance or depress synaptic transmission.\nVia the release of a number of different neuromodulators,\npostsynaptic\ncells\ncan\nalso\ninfluence\nthe\nrelease\nof\ntransmitter from presynaptic terminals. A common scenar-\nio is that in response to strong postsynaptic depolarization,\ndendrites release retrograde messengers that act through G-\nprotein-coupled receptors located on presynaptic terminals\nto influence neurotransmitter release. Retrograde messen-\ngers that have been identified in specific cell types include\ndopamine, dynorphin, glutamate, GABA, nitric oxide,\nbrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and oxytocin\n(Drake et al, 1994; Kombian et al, 1997; Llano et al, 1991;\nNaggapan and Lu, 2005; Nugent et al, 2007; Pitler and Alger,\n1992; Zilberter, 2000; Zilberter et al, 1999). Although\npostsynaptic, calcium-dependent fusion of vesicles is one\ncommon mechanism for the release of retrograde messen-\ngers, they can also released by non-vesicular mechanisms.\nFor example, a widespread, extensively studied system for\nmediating retrograde synaptic signaling involves the post-\nsynaptic release of endogenous cannabinoids, such as\nanandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, which are pro-\nduced upon demand by cleavage of phospholipids and are\nsensed by CB1 receptors on presynaptic terminals. The\nmechanisms of endocannabinoid release are unclear and\nmay involve a transporter, which facilitates diffusion across\nthe plasma membrane (Chevaleyre et al, 2006) Such\nretrograde signaling by postsynaptic release of endocanna-\nbinoids can be initiated by strong depolarization or\nactivation of postsynaptic metabotropic receptors and has\nbeen shown to transiently suppress inhibitory and excita-\ntory synapses in several brain regions (Chevaleyre et al,\n2006). Importantly, in the striatum, there is a form of LTD\n(to be discussed below) that is triggered by the release of\nendocannabinoids.\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n19\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\nInvolvement of Glia in Short-Term Plasticity\nThere is growing realization that glia may be involved in\nsome forms of short-term plasticity (Araque et al, 2001;\nHaydon,\n2001).\nWith\ntheir\nintimate\nassociation\nwith\nsynapses, astrocytes and perisynaptic Schwann cells are\nwell\npositioned\nto\nregulate\nsynapses.\nThey\nhave\nan\nestablished role in clearance of neurotransmitter and may\nparticipate in synaptic plasticity by controlling the speed\nand extent of such clearance (Bergles et al, 1999; Danbolt,\n2001). This can in turn impact on the degree of postsynaptic\nreceptor activation and desensitization. Another way that\nglia may be involved in synaptic plasticity is by sensing\nextracellular messengers and then releasing substances that\nin turn can directly affect synaptic efficacy (Araque et al,\n2001; Haydon, 2001). For example, glia express many\ndifferent neurotransmitter receptors (eg, glutamate recep-\ntors), which when activated result in the release of\nsubstances (eg, ATP) that can then act on presynaptic\nterminals to regulate neurotransmitter release.\nFunctions of Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity\nShort-term synaptic plasticity was originally established as\nbehaviorally important from studies of simple organisms\nsuch as Aplysia (Kandel and Tauc, 1965). In the mammalian\nbrain, an important consequence of short-term synaptic\nplasticity\nis\nto\ninfluence\nthe\ninformation\nprocessing\nfunction of synapses, enabling them to act as filters with a\nwide range of properties. For example, synapses with a low\ninitial probability of release function as high-pass filters,\nsince they will facilitate during high-frequency action\npotential bursts while low-frequency bursts will not be\ntransmitted with the same efficacy. In contrast, synapses\nwith a high initial probability of release function as low-pass\nfilters, since they will depress during high-frequency bursts\nbut will reliably relay low-frequency activity (Abbott and\nRegehr, 2004). The filtering characteristics of a synapse can\nbe adjusted through modulation of the initial release\nprobability. This most commonly occurs due to the release\nof neuromodulators that, via activation of presynaptic\nreceptors, reduce the probability of release. This changes\nthe filtering characteristics of the synapse, causing facilita-\ntion to become predominant over depression. In this way,\npresynaptic inhibition can convert a synapse from a low-\npass to a high-pass filter.\nLONG-TERM SYNAPTIC PLASTICIY\nIt is widely believed that experience of any sort modifies\nsubsequent behavior at least in part through activity-\ndependent, long-lasting modifications of synaptic strength.\nThe brain encodes external and internal events as complex,\nspatio-temporal patterns of activity in large ensembles\nof neurons that can be conceptualized as \u2018neural circuits\u2019.\nA key feature defining the behavior of any given neural\ncircuit is the pattern of synaptic weights that connect\nthe individual neurons that comprise the circuit. A corollary\nto this hypothesis is that new information is stored\n(ie, memories are generated) when activity in a circuit\ncauses a long-lasting change in the pattern of synaptic\nweights. This idea was put forward over 100 years ago\nby the Spanish Nobel laureate Santiago Ramon y Cajal,\nand was further advanced in the late 1940s by Donald\nHebb,\nwho\nproposed\nthat\nassociative\nmemories\nare\nformed in the brain by a process of synaptic modification\nthat strengthens connections when presynaptic activity\ncorrelates with postsynaptic firing (Hebb, 1949). This\nproposed\nfunction\nfor\nsynaptic\nplasticity,\nforming\na\nmemory trace following the detection of two coincident\nevents, suggests an appealing cellular basis for behavioral\nphenomena\nsuch\nas\nPavlovian\nclassical\nconditioning\n(Pavlov, 1927).\nExperimental support for the very existence of such\nlong-lasting,\nactivity-dependent\nchanges\nin\nsynaptic\nstrength was lacking until the early 1970s when Bliss\nand colleagues (Bliss and Gardner-Medwin, 1973; Bliss\nand Lomo, 1973) reported that repetitive activation of\nexcitatory synapses in the hippocampus caused a potentia-\ntion of synaptic strength that could last for hours or even\ndays. Over the last three decades, this phenomenon,\neventually termed LTP, has been the object of intense\ninvestigation because it is widely believed that it provides an\nimportant key to understanding some of the cellular and\nmolecular mechanisms by which memories are formed\n(Martin et al, 2000; Pastalkova et al, 2006; Whitlock et al,\n2006).\nAlthough still considered prototypic, it is now clear that\nhippocampal LTP is only one of several different forms of\nlong-term synaptic plasticity that exist in specific circuits in\nthe mammalian brain. Importantly, it is well established\nthat most synapses that exhibit LTP also express one or\nmore forms of LTD. Thus, a key concept is that synaptic\nstrength at excitatory synapses is bidirectionally modifiable\nby different patterns of activity. Furthermore, it is now clear\nthat the terms \u2018LTP\u2019 and \u2018LTD\u2019 describe a class of\nphenomena, the underlying mechanisms of which vary\ndepending on the circuits in which they function.\nAdditional forms of synaptic plasticity more recently\nidentified\ninclude\nhomeostatic\nplasticity\n(Turrigiano\nand\nNelson,\n2004) and\nmetaplasticity\n(Abraham\nand\nBear, 1996). The major form of homeostatic plasticity is\n\u2018synaptic scaling\u2019, which describes phenomena whereby\nthe strength of all synapses on a given cell are adjusted in\nresponse to prolonged changes in activity. Specifically,\nprolonged decreases in overall activity cause a net scaling\nup of total synaptic strengths while prolonged increases in\nactivity cause the opposite, a scaling down of synaptic\nstrengths. This form of plasticity operates on a much\nslower timescale than LTP or LTD and may be parti-\ncularly\nimportant\nduring\nthe\ndevelopment\nof\nneural\ncircuits. Metaplasticity refers to the effects that activity\ncan have on the capacity of synapses to express long-term\nplasticity.\nThe most extensively studied and therefore prototypic\nforms of synaptic plasticity are the LTP and LTD observed\nin the CA1 region of the hippocampus (Figure 1), which are\ntriggered by activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)\nreceptors (NMDARs). We will therefore begin with a\ndiscussion of their underlying mechanisms. We will then\nproceed to reviewing some of the other prominent forms of\nLTP and LTD for which mechanisms have been most firmly\nestablished.\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n20\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\nNMDAR-Dependent LTP\nNo form of plasticity has generated more interest, or been\nmore extensively studied than LTP in the CA1 region of the\nhippocampus. The excitement surrounding this phenom-\nenon is due to compelling evidence from rodents, primates,\nand humans associating the hippocampus with a neural\nsystem involved in various forms of long-term memory\n(Martin et al, 2000; Zola-Morgan and Squire, 1993).\nFurthermore, several basic properties of LTP make it an\nattractive cellular mechanism for rapid information storage.\nSimilar to memory, LTP can be generated rapidly and is\nstrengthened and prolonged by repetition. It also exhibits\ncooperativity, associativity, and input specificity. (Nicoll\net al, 1988). Cooperativity means that LTP can be induced\nby the coincident activation of a critical number of\nsynapses. Associativity is the capacity to potentiate a weak\ninput (a small number of synapses) when it is activated in\nassociation with a strong input (a larger number of\nsynapses). As such, associativity is a cellular analogue of\nclassical conditioning and is an implicit property of the so-\ncalled Hebbian synapse. Input specificity indicates that LTP\nis elicited only at activated synapses and not at adjacent,\ninactive synapses on the same postsynaptic cell. This feature\ndramatically increases the storage capacity of individual\nneurons since different synapses on the same cell can be\ninvolved in separate circuits encoding different bits of\ninformation.\nA major technological advance in the study of synaptic\nplasticity was the development of the hippocampal slice\npreparation that made LTP accessible to rigorous experi-\nmental analysis (Figure 1b). Indeed, the bulk of our\nknowledge on the molecular mechanisms of LTP has been\nderived from studies of LTP at excitatory synapses on CA1\npyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices. Similar or\nidentical forms of LTP have been observed at excitatory\nsynapses throughout the brain. Thus, the conclusions drawn\nfrom the study of LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region are\noften applied to other brain regions.\nTriggering NMDAR-dependent LTP. A major advance in\nthe understanding of excitatory synaptic function and LTP\nwas the demonstration that two major types of ionotropic\nglutamate receptors contribute to the postsynaptic response\nat glutamatergic synapses, a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-\nisoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors (AMPARs) and\nNMDARs (Figure 1c). These receptors are often (although\nnot always, as will be elaborated upon later) found\nAMPAR\nNMDAR\nMg2+\nMg2+\nNa+\nCa2+\nNa+\nNa+\nDepolarization\n2\n2\n1\n0\n10 20 30 40 50\n0\n10 20 30 40 50\n50\n100\n150\n200\nTime (min)\nTime (min)\nLTP\nLTD\nfEPSP slope (%)\n1\n2\n1\n50\n100\n150\n200\nRec\nCA1\nStim\nCA3\nSC\nDG\nMF\nFigure 1\nNMDAR-dependent LTP and LTD at hippocampal CA1 synapses.

(c) Model of synaptic transmission at excitatory synapses. During basal synaptic transmission (left panel), synaptically released glutamate binds\nboth the NMDA and AMPARs. Na + flows through the AMPAR channel but not through the NMDAR channel because of the Mg2 + block of this channel.\nDepolarization of the postsynaptic cell (right) relieves the Mg2 + block of the NMDAR channel and allows both Na + and Ca2 + to flow into the dendritic\nspine. The resultant increase in Ca2 + in the dendritic spine is necessary for triggering the subsequent events that drive synaptic plasticity.\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n21\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\ncolocalized on individual dendritic spines. The AMPAR has\na channel that is permeable to monovalent cations (Na +\nand K +), and activation of AMPARs provides most of the\ninward current that generates the excitatory synaptic\nresponse when the cell is close to its resting membrane\npotential. In contrast to AMPARs, the NMDAR exhibits a\nstrong voltage dependence because of the block of its\nchannel at negative membrane potentials by extracellular\nmagnesium (Mayer et al, 1984; Nowak et al, 1984). As a\nresult,\nNMDARs\ncontribute\nlittle\nto\nthe\npostsynaptic\nresponse during basal synaptic activity. However, when\nthe cell is depolarized, magnesium dissociates from its\nbinding site within the NMDAR channel, allowing ions to\nenter the cell. Importantly, unlike AMPAR channels, the\nNMDAR channel allows calcium as well as sodium to enter\nthe postsynaptic dendritic spine (Figure 1c).\nIt is firmly established that the triggering (also termed the\ninduction) of LTP in the CA1 region requires activation of\nNMDARs during strong postsynaptic depolarization leading\nto\na\nincrease\nin\npostsynaptic\ncalcium\nconcentration,\nwhich likely has to reach some critical threshold value to\nactivate the biochemical processes necessary for LTP\n(Malenka, 1991; Malenka and Nicoll, 1993). Experimentally,\nthis is normally achieved by applying high-frequency\ntetanic stimulation to the synapses or by use of a \u2018pairing-\nprotocol\u2019 during which the postsynaptic cell is directly\ndepolarized while low-frequency synaptic activation is\nsustained. An additional method for induction of LTP (as\nwell as LTD) involves protocols that generate so-called\n\u2018spike-time dependent plasticity\u2019 (STDP; Dan and Poo, 2006;\nMarkram et al, 1997). In studies of STDP, LTP is induced\nif afferent stimulation generates a synaptic response within\na\ndiscrete\ntime\nwindow\nprior\nto\nthe\nfiring\nof\nthe\npostsynaptic cell.\nBecause its contribution to postsynaptic reponses re-\nquires both presynaptic release of glutamate and post-\nsynaptic depolarization due to the simultaneous activation\nof a population of synapses, the NMDAR is often referred to\nas a \u2018coincidence detector\u2019. These properties of NMDARs\nalso explain the basic properties of LTP. Cooperativity and\nassociativity occur because of the requirement for multiple\nsynapses\nto\nbe\nactivated\nsimultaneously\nto\ngenerate\nadequate postsynaptic depolarization to remove the mag-\nnesium block of the NMDAR. Input specificity is due to the\ncompartmentalized increase in calcium, which is limited to\nthe postsynaptic dendritic spine and does not influence\nadjacent spines (Nicoll et al, 1988).\nLTP\nsignal\ntransduction\nmechanisms.\nAn\nextensive\nnumber\nof\nsignal\ntransduction\nmolecules\nhave\nbeen\nsuggested to play a role in translating the calcium signal\nthat is required to trigger LTP into the long-lasting increase\nin synaptic strength (Malenka and Bear, 2004; Sanes and\nLichtman, 1999). However, only for a handful of these has\ncompelling evidence of a mandatory role in LTP been\npresented. A major limitation of much of the literature on\nthis topic stems from inadequate distinctions between\nmolecules that are key components of the molecular\nmachinery directly responsible for the triggering of LTP\n(\u2018mediators\u2019), and those molecules which may modulate\nthe ability to generate LTP, or play a permissive role\n(\u2018modulators\u2019). Some basic criteria that can be suggested for\ndefining the role of a protein as a mediator of LTP induction\nare: (1) blocking the activation of the molecule during LTP\ninduction blocks LTP; and (2) activation of the molecule\ninduces a potentiation of synaptic transmission, which\noccludes further synaptic induction of LTP.\nStrong\nevidence\nindicates\nthat\ncalcium/calmodulin\n(CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) fulfills these\nrequirements and is a key component of the molecular\nmachinery for LTP. CaMKII undergoes autophosphoryla-\ntion after the triggering of LTP (Barria et al, 1997; Fukunaga\net al, 1995), and LTP induction was prevented both in\nknockout mice lacking a critical CaMKII subunit (Silva\net al, 1992), and in knock-in animals in which endogenous\nCaMKII was replaced with a form lacking the autopho-\nsphorylation site (Giese et al, 1998). Furthermore, inhibition\nof CaMKII activity by directly loading postsynaptic cells\nwith peptides that impair CaMKII function blocks LTP\n(Malenka et al, 1989; Malinow et al, 1989), whereas acutely\nincreasing the postsynaptic concentration of active CaMKII\nincreases synaptic strength and occludes LTP (Lledo et al,\n1995; Pettit et al, 1994).\nSeveral other kinases have been implicated in the\ntriggering of LTP, but the experimental evidence supporting\ntheir role is not as well substantiated as that for CaMKII.\nActivation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-depen-\ndent protein kinase (PKA), perhaps by the activation of a\ncalmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase, has been suggested\nto boost the activity of CaMKII indirectly by decreasing\ncompeting protein phosphatase activity (Blitzer et al, 1998;\nLisman, 1989; Makhinson et al, 1999). This presumably\nhappens by phosphorylation of inhibitor 1, an endogenous\ninhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). The extracellular\nsignal-regulated\nkinase\n(Erk)/mitogen-activated\nprotein\nkinase (MAPK) pathway has also been suggested to be\nimportant for LTP, as well as some forms of learning and\nmemory (Sweatt, 2004; Thomas and Huganir, 2004). In\naddition, Src kinase has been implicated in the enhance-\nment of NMDAR function during LTP induction (Kalia\net al, 2004). Finally, protein kinase C and in particular the\natypical\nPKC\nisozyme,\nPKMz,\nhas\nreceived\nattention\nbecause this isozyme is rapidly expressed upon induction\nof LTP and recent studies have implicated PKMz in the\nmaintenance of the late phase of LTP both in hippocampal\nslices and in vivo (Hrabetova and Sacktor, 1996; Ling et al,\n2002; Pastalkova et al, 2006; Serrano et al, 2005).\nObviously, it remains a very challenging task to be able to\ndefinitively identify the key intracellular signaling cascades\nresponsible for the triggering of LTP. Recent technical\nadvances in mass spectrometric techniques for the profiling\nof post-transcriptional modifications in mixed populations\nof proteins, as well as the practicality of RNAi approaches\nfor knockdown of candidate proteins, should help further\ncharacterize the major LTP players and their dynamic\ninterplay.\nExpression mechanisms of LTP. In the past, a major point\nof contention was whether LTP was primarily expressed\npostsynaptically as a change in AMPAR properties or\npresynaptically, as a change in the probability of transmitter\nrelease. This latter expression mechanism garnered sig-\nnificant attention because it required the production of a\nretrograde messenger that was released by postsynaptic\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n22\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\ncells and acted on presynaptic terminals (for a thorough\nreview of the evidence for either locus of expression, see\nNicoll, 2003). To a large extent, this controversy has been\nresolved, with the emerging consensus that the major\nmechanism of expression of LTP at hippocampal CA1\nsynapses involves an increase in the numbers of AMPARs\nwithin the postsynaptic density, driven through activity-\ndependent changes in AMPAR trafficking (Bredt and Nicoll,\n2003; Derkach et al, 2007; Malenka and Nicoll, 1999;\nMalinow and Malenka, 2002; Song and Huganir, 2002).\nA major contribution to ending the controversy was the\nproposal of the silent synapse hypothesis and the evidence\nsupporting it (Durand et al, 1996; Isaac et al, 1995; Liao\net al, 1995; Malenka and Nicoll, 1997). Silent synapses are\nsynapses that contain only NMDARs with few or no\nAMPARs, such that at normal resting membrane potentials\nthese synapses exhibit no detectable postsynaptic responses\nto synaptically released glutamate. The \u2018unsilencing\u2019 of these\nsynapses during the induction of LTP is thought to occur\nthrough the incorporation of AMPARs into the postsynaptic\nplasma membrane. This hypothesis was quickly expanded\nto include synapses that already contained AMPARs and\nhas led to a large investigative effort into the molecular\nmechanisms regulating the trafficking of AMPARs (Bredt\nand Nicoll, 2003; Collingridge et al, 2004; Malinow and\nMalenka, 2002; Sheng and Kim, 2002; Song and Huganir,\n2002).\nMost\nAMPARs\nin\nthe\ncentral\nnervous\nsystem\nare\ntetramers comprised of four glutamate receptor subunits,\nGluR1\u2013GluR4. Although these subunits are highly homo-\nlogous, both the functional properties of AMPARs and their\ntrafficking has been suggested to depend on their subunit\ncomposition (Collingridge et al, 2004; Derkach et al, 2007;\nMalinow and Malenka, 2002). In the adult hippocampus,\ntwo forms of AMPARs are thought to predominate: GluR1/\nGluR2 heteromers and GluR2/GluR3 heteromers (Wenthold\net al, 1996). Based on clever overexpression studies, one\nprominent hypothesis suggests that subunit-specific rules\ngovern the synaptic delivery of AMPARs (Hayashi et al,\n2000; Passafaro et al, 2001; Shi et al, 2001). Specifically, it\nhas been suggested that the insertion of GluR1-containing\nAMPARs into synapses is slow under basal conditions and\nis strongly stimulated by NMDAR activation, whereas\ninsertion of GluR2/3 heteromeric receptors may occur\nconstitutively on a much more rapid timescale.\nWhere do these new AMPARs come from and how is their\ntrafficking regulated at a molecular level? Current evidence\nsuggests that recycling endosomes in the dendrites contain\na reserve pool of AMPARs that are mobilized during LTP\nvia a process that requires the small GTP-binding protein,\nRab11a (Park et al, 2004) (Figure 2). Surprisingly, AMPARs\ndo not appear to be inserted directly into the postsynaptic\ndensity (PSD) but rather are exocytosed at perisynaptic\nsites. They then can laterally diffuse in the plasma\nmembrane and be trapped within the PSD due to their\ninteractions with so-called \u2018slot proteins\u2019, which function to\ntrap AMPARs and greatly reduce their lateral mobility.\nAttractive candidates for these slot proteins are a family of\nproteins found in the PSD termed MAGUKs (for mem-\nbrane-associated guanylate kinases). MAGUKS are defined\nby\ntheir\nmultiple\nprotein\ninteraction\ndomains,\nmost\nimportantly so-called PDZ domains. Prominent members\nof the MAGUK family of PSD proteins include PSD-95,\nSAP97, PSD-93, and SAP102 (Kim and Sheng, 2004;\nMontgomery et al, 2004). PSD-95 has received the most\nattention and its level appears to be particularly important\nfor controlling the number of AMPARs at individual\nsynapses as evidenced by the findings that overexpression\nof PSD-95 increases synaptic strength and occludes LTP\n(Ehrlich and Malinow, 2004; Stein et al, 2003), whereas\nknockdown of PSD-95 decreases surface expression of\nAMPARs and synaptic strength (Ehrlich et al, 2007; Schluter\net al, 2006).\nThe influence of PSD-95, as well as other MAGUKS (Elias\net al, 2006; Futai et al, 2007; Schluter et al, 2006), on\nAMPARs was surprising given that PSD-95 was originally\nisolated because of its strong interaction with NMDARs\n(Kornau et al, 1995). Another major surprise was that\nAMPARs do not directly bind to MAGUKs but rather do so\nvia a family of AMPAR auxiliary subunits termed trans-\nmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs). TARPs\nare required for the delivery of AMPARs to the plasma\nmembrane at extrasynaptic sites (Chen et al, 2000; Nicoll\net al, 2006) and also influence their biophysical properties\n(Tomita et al, 2005a). Importantly, they are also required\nfor the synaptic localization of AMPARs due to their direct\ninteraction with MAGUKs (Schnell et al, 2002).\nThe detailed molecular mechanisms by which activation\nof protein kinases such as CaMKII lead to the synaptic\ndelivery of AMPARs remains to be determined. Phosphor-\nylation of AMPAR subunits themselves by CaMKII does not\nappear critical (Esteban et al, 2003; Lee et al, 2003) although\nother phosphorylation sites, such as the PKA or the PKC\nsites on GluR1, may be important (Boehm et al, 2006;\nEsteban et al, 2003). On the other hand, there is reasonable\nevidence that phosphorylation of TARPs occurs following\nCAMKII activation (Tsui and Malenka, 2006) and that this\nmay be critical for LTP (Tomita et al, 2005b). It is, however,\nhighly likely that AMPARs and TARPs are just a component\nof a large complex of proteins, the phosphorylation of which\nwill be required for LTP expression.\nLTP also appears to involve a phosphorylation-driven\nincrease in the single-channel conductance of AMPARs\nthemselves (Benke et al, 1998; Soderling and Derkach,\n2000). Indeed, CaMKII phosphorylates Ser831 in the\nintracellular C terminus of GluR1, resulting in a significant\nincrease in single-channel conductance of homomeric\nGluR1 receptors (Derkach et al, 1999, 2007). However, one\nimportant caveat of this conclusion is that synaptic GluR1-\ncontaining AMPARs also contain GluR2, and in GluR1/2\nheteromeric AMPARs, the enhanced conductance upon\nphosphorylation by CaMKII is absent (Oh and Derkach,\n2005).\nAlthough the evidence to date suggests a more prominent\nrole for AMPAR exocytosis, the relative contribution of\nAMPAR trafficking and changes in the biophysical proper-\nties of AMPARs to the increase in synaptic strength during\nLTP are not well defined. One model for the successive\nevents occurring during the first hour of LTP involves\nactivation of calcium-dependent signal transduction path-\nways, notably CaMKII, resulting in phosphorylation of\nGluR1-containing receptors and an increase in their single-\nchannel conductance. Roughly simultaneously, AMPARs\nare translocated into the PSD via exocytosis and lateral\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n23\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\nmovement within the plasma membrane. Most investigators\nbelieve that the incorporation of AMPARs into the PSD is\nthe more important change because it appears to be\naccompanied by structural changes in the dendritic spines\nand synapses themselves, an attractive mechanism for\nmaintaining LTP (see below). There are also experimental\nfindings consistent with rapid presynaptic changes during\nLTP, but the retrograde messenger that is responsible\nremains elusive, one prominent possibility being BDNF\n(Bramham and Messaoudi, 2005).\nMaintaining\nLTP.\nMuch\nof\nthe\nwork\non\nNMDAR-\ndependent LTP has focused on the mechanisms responsible\nfor its initial 30\u201360 min, to a large extent because of\ntechnical limitations in the duration over which stable\nelectrophysiological recordings can be maintained. None-\ntheless, the mechanisms that allow LTP to persist for hours,\ndays, or even longer are of great importance. Like virtually\nall cell biological phenomena, the persistence of LTP is\ndependent upon new protein synthesis (Reymann and Frey,\n2007). This so-called \u2018late phase of LTP\u2019 (defined as the\npotentiation present more than 1\u20132 h after LTP induction)\nis commonly assumed to depend upon local dendritic\nprotein synthesis, which supplies needed components to the\nsynapse (Sutton and Schuman, 2006), as well as transcrip-\ntion in the nucleus (Zhou et al, 2006). The signaling to the\nnucleus required for long-lasting LTP has been suggested to\ndepend on a number of protein kinases including PKA,\nCaMKIV, and Erk-MAPK, which activate key transcription\nfactors that may include cAMP response element-binding\nprotein and immediate-early genes such as c-Fos and\nZif268/Egr-1 (Thomas and Huganir, 2004). These transcrip-\ntional\ncomplexes\npresumably\npromote\nexpression\nof\neffector genes that are required for maintaining the synaptic\nenhancement.\nSeveral mRNAs can be found in dendrites, including\nthose of the AMPARs themselves, CaMKII, Arc, and\nproteins which may function to regulate receptor trafficking\n(Grooms et al, 2006; Job and Eberwine, 2001; Ju et al, 2004;\nMayford et al, 1996; Schuman et al, 2006; Steward and\nSchuman, 2001). The trafficking of some of these mRNAs\nand their local translation seems to be highly regulated by\nactivity. Furthermore, other components of the translational\nmachinery are found in or adjacent to dendritic spines and\npolyribosomes are recruited to spine heads following LTP\ninduction (Bourne et al, 2007). Thus, there is accumulating\nevidence that the machinery to provide local, newly\nsynthesized proteins to synapses is available.\nAn intriguing hypothesis is that during the synaptic\nactivation to induce LTP a \u2018synaptic tag\u2019 is generated that\nfunctions to capture or sequester plasticity related proteins,\nwhich in turn are required to stabilize the increase in\nsynaptic strength (Frey and Morris, 1997). However, little is\nknown about the identity of the synaptic tag or the newly\nsynthesized proteins that are required to maintain LTP,\nalthough it has been suggested that PKA, CAMKII, or PKMz\nmight function as the synaptic tag (Reymann and Frey,\n2007; Sajikumar et al, 2005; Young et al, 2006).\nA compelling possibility for a long-term maintenance\nmechanism\nof\nLTP\nis\nthe\nstructural\nremodeling\nof\nAMPAR\nNMDAR\nEndocytosis\nRecycling\nExocytosis\nAMPAR\nNMDAR\nAMPAR\nNMDAR\nCa2+\nCaMKII\nCa2+\nCalcineurin \nPP1\nLTP\nLTD\nRab11a\nFigure 2\nModel of AMPAR trafficking during LTP and LTD. In the basal state (depicted on top), receptors cycle between the postsynaptic membrane and\nintracellular compartments. This is achieved through lateral mobility of the receptors out of the synapse into endocytic zones, where they are endocytosed\ninto early endosomes in a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent manner. Normally, the receptors are transferred to recycling endosomes and returned to the\nplasma membrane by exocytosis, followed by lateral movement into the synapse where they are retained through interaction with MAGUKs. Following\ninduction of LTP, there is enhanced receptor exocytosis and stabilization at the synapse through a calcium-driven process that involves CAMKII and fusion of\nrecycling endosomes mediated by Rab11a. Following the induction of LTD, enhanced endocytosis at extrasynaptic sites occurs in a process that is calcium-\ndependent and involves protein phosphatases, primarily calcineurin and protein phosphatases 1 (PP1). While in the basal state endocytosis is presumably\nbalanced by receptor recycling, following LTD receptors are retained within the cell, and perhaps degraded.\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n24\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\npotentiated synapses (Luscher et al, 2000). Spines come in a\nvariety of shapes and sizes, and can undergo rapid shape\nchanges\nthat\nare\ninfluenced\nby\nactivity\n(Yuste\nand\nBonhoeffer, 2001). Morphological changes which have been\nreported\nto\naccompany LTP\ninclude\ngrowth\nof new\ndendritic spines, enlargement of preexisiting spines and\ntheir PSDs, and the splitting of single PSDs and spines into\ntwo functional synapses (Abraham and Williams, 2003;\nMatsuzaki et al, 2004; Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2001). An\nattractive\nmodel\nsuggests\nthat\nduring\nLTP,\nrecycling\nendosomes contribute AMPAR subunits to the synapse, as\nwell as lipids and constituents which enlarge the synapse\n(Lisman and Zhabotinsky, 2001; Luscher et al, 2000; Park\net al, 2004, 2006). At some later time point, there is likely a\nconcomitant increase in the presynaptic active zone, the size\nof which always closely matches that of the PSD (Lisman\nand Harris, 1993). This presynaptic re-modeling must\ninvolve post- and presynaptic protein interactions with\nlikely candidates being cell adhesion molecules such as the\ncadherins or neuroligin/neurexin interactions.\nSummary. The current view of the mechanisms underlying\nthis form of LTP can be summarized as follows (Figure 2). A\nlarge\nNMDAR-dependent\nincrease\nin\ndendritic\nspine\ncalcium concentrations leads to activation of intracellular\nsignaling cascades involving a number of protein kinases,\nmost importantly CaMKII. This leads to an increase in the\nsingle-channel conductance of synaptic AMPARs and more\nimportantly, promotes the incorporation of additional\nAMPARs into the PSD. The new synaptic AMPARs are\nstabilized through their TARP-mediated interaction with\nPDZ domain-containing proteins such as PSD-95. In\nparallel, structural changes within the synapse occur, such\nthat the size of the PSD and dendritic spine are increased.\nThis in turn drives an increase in the size of the presynaptic\nactive\nzone\nsuch\nthat\nthe\npotentiated\nsynapses\nare\n\u2018permanently\u2019 enlarged. The maintenance of these changes\nfor more than a few hours depends on de novo transcription\nas well as local dendritic protein synthesis, presumbably to\nprovide the synapses with a supply of the critical proteins\nnecessary for maintaining synaptic strength.\nNMDAR-Dependent LTD\nAn important advance in the study of long-term synaptic\nplasticity was the establishment of an experimentally\nreproducible form of NMDAR-dependent LTD at excitatory\nsynapses on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (Dudek and\nBear, 1992). This demonstrated that activity could bi-\ndirectionally control synaptic strength (Mulkey and Malenka,\n1992), thus providing support for the idea that memories or\nexperiences were encoded by the distribution of synaptic\nweights in neural circuits, not simply by LTP. Shortly\nthereafter,\na\nsimilar\nform\nof\nLTD\nwas\nobserved\nat\nneocortical synapses (Kirkwood et al, 1993) suggesting that\nmechanistic studies in the hippocampal CA1 region could\nprovide\ninsights\nthat\napplied\nto\nexcitatory\nsynapses\nthroughout the brain. While that remains true to a large\nextent, we now know that in addition to NMDAR-dependent\nLTD, there are several other forms of LTD, which we will\ndiscuss in later sections. Moreover, similar to LTP, evidence\nis accumulating that LTD mechanisms may contribute to a\nlarge number of brain phenomena including experience-\ndependent development, learning and memory, addiction,\nand neurological disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and\nParkinson\u2019s disease (Malenka and Bear, 2004; Brebner et al,\n2005; Kreitzer and Malenka 2007; Hsieh et al, 2006).\nTriggering NMDAR-dependent LTD. The typical protocol\nfor\neliciting\nLTD\ninvolves\nprolonged\nrepetitive\nlow-\nfrequency stimulation (B900 stimuli at 1 Hz; Dudek and\nBear, 1992; Mulkey and Malenka, 1992), although the\nnumber of stimuli can be dramatically reduced and the\nfrequency changed if the postsynaptic neuron is modestly\ndepolarized (to B\u000250 mV), partially relieving the Mg2 +\nblock of the NMDAR (Selig et al, 1995). NMDAR-dependent\nLTD can also be induced by correctly timing the activation\nof presynaptic axons and the postsynaptic neuron (STDP;\n(Dan and Poo, 2006).\nLike LTP, LTD is input-specific and depends upon an\nNMDAR-dependent\nincrease\nin\npostsynaptic\ncalcium\n(Mulkey and Malenka, 1992). The predominant current\nhypothesis is that quantitative properties of the postsynap-\ntic calcium signal within dendritic spines dictates whether\nLTP or LTD is triggered, with LTD requiring a modest\nincrease in calcium (Cummings et al, 1996), whereas LTP\nrequires a increase beyond some critical threshold value\n(Malenka and Nicoll, 1993). The temporal characteristics of\nthe increase in calcium may also be important since\nchanging the relative timing between pre- and postsynaptic\nactivation by just a few tens of milliseconds can reverse the\ndirection of synaptic modification (Dan and Poo, 2006).\nDifferential buffering of postsynaptic calcium levels has\nbeen reported to enable a transition between LTP and LTD\n(Harney et al, 2006; Nishiyama et al, 2000). These findings\ndemonstrate the thin line that lies between synaptic activity\neliciting a potentiation vs a depression and provide support\nto the idea that both LTP and LTD are utilized in parallel for\nencoding experiences in vivo.\nLTD signal transduction mechanisms. An influential\nhypothesis for the signal transduction pathway triggering\nLTD suggested that while LTP was due to the preferential\nactivation of CaMKII, LTD involves activation of a calcium-\ndependent protein phosphatase cascade consisting of the\ncalcium/calmodulin-dependent\nphosphatase\ncalcineurin\n(also known as protein phosphatase 2B), PP1, and a\nphosphoprotein termed inhibitor-1 which functions to\ninhibit PP1 until it is dephosphorylated by calcineurin\n(Lisman, 1989). Consistent with this hypothesis, postsynap-\ntic inhibition of these phosphatases prevents LTD (Kirk-\nwood and Bear, 1994; Morishita et al, 2001; Mulkey et al,\n1994, 1993), whereas directly loading CA1 pyramidal cells\nwith PP1 enhances LTD (Morishita et al, 2001). Although\nsignaling proteins other than phosphatases have been\nsuggested to play key roles in LTD (Bolshakov et al, 2000;\nDan and Poo, 2006; Palmer et al, 2005; Peineau et al, 2007),\nthe hypothesis that LTP involves preferential activation of\nprotein kinases while LTD involves activation of phospha-\ntases remains predominant.\nLTD has been found to correlate with dephosphorylation\nof\npostsynaptic\nPKC\nand\nPKA\nsubstrates\nwithout\na\ndetectable change in CaMKII substrate phosphorylation\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n25\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\n(Hrabetova and Sacktor, 1996; Kameyama et al, 1998; Lee\net al, 2000, 1998. The evidence in support of a role for\ndephosphorylation\nof\nPKA\nsubstrates\nduring\nLTD\nis\nparticularly convincing, as postsynaptic inhibition of PKA,\nor its displacement from intracellular anchoring proteins,\ncause a rundown of synaptic transmission that occludes\nLTD. The mechanism underlying specific dephosphoryla-\ntion of PKA substrates during LTD could involve the\nNMDAR-dependent recruitment of PP1 to synapses (Mor-\nishita et al, 2001) or the selective loss of PKA from synapses\n(Gomez et al, 2002; Snyder et al, 2005). Consistent with a\nrole for PKA, LTD is associated with selective depho-\nsphorylation of Ser845 on GluR1, a PKA substrate site (Lee\net al, 2000). This dephosphorylation event may contribute\nto the expression of LTD, as it decreases the AMPAR open-\nchannel probability (Banke et al, 2000), and mice with\nknock-in alanine substitution of both Ser845 and Ser831 (a\nCaMKII-substrate site) exhibit impaired NMDAR-depen-\ndent LTD (Lee et al, 2003).\nExpression mechanisms of LTD. The demonstration of\nsilent synapses and their conversion to functional synapses\nduring LTP by the incorporation of AMPARs (Malenka and\nNicoll, 1997) immediately gave credence to the idea that the\nopposite might happen during LTD, that is, the removal or\nendocytosis of AMPARs. Consistent with this idea, it was\ndemonstrated that pharmacological manipulations of activ-\nity in cultured neurons (Carroll et al, 1999; Lissin et al,\n1998) or application of glutamate receptor agonists (Beattie\net al, 2000; Carroll et al, 1999; Ehlers, 2000; Heynen et al,\n2000; Lin et al, 2000; Lissin et al, 1998) could cause a loss of\nAMPARs from synapses due to dynamin- and clathrin-\ndependent endocytosis (Carroll et al, 2001; Collingridge\net al, 2004; Derkach et al, 2007; Malinow and Malenka,\n2002). Furthermore, postsynaptic inhibition of dynamin\nactivity impaired LTD in CA1 pyramidal cells in slices (Lee\net al, 2002; Luscher et al, 1999; Morishita et al, 2005). Based\nin large part on these sorts of observations, the current\nleading hypothesis is that the expression mechanism of\nNMDAR-dependent LTD is due to activity-dependent\nendocytosis of synaptic AMPARs (Bredt and Nicoll, 2003;\nCollingridge et al, 2004; Derkach et al, 2007; Malenka and\nBear, 2004; Malinow and Malenka, 2002) (Figure 2).\nThe precise molecular mechanisms by which endocytosis\nof AMPARs occurs during LTD is still not clear but one\nlikely scenario is that it involves dissociation of AMPARs\nfrom their anchors within the PSD, followed by lateral\nmovement to the edge of the PSD where they undergo\nclathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis (Ashby et al,\n2004; Blanpied et al, 2002; Groc et al, 2004). Consistent with\na key role for protein phosphatases, the endocytosis of\nAMPARs is regulated by calcium-dependent dephosphor-\nylation (Beattie et al, 2000; Carroll et al, 2001; Ehlers, 2000).\nKey substrates for facilitating endocytosis may include\ncomponents of the endocytic machinery (Carroll et al, 2001;\nLai et al, 1999; Slepnev et al, 1998) as well as AMPAR\nsubunits themselves (Ehlers, 2000). Following endocytosis,\nAMPARs exhibit increased colocalization with the clathrin\nadaptor protein AP2 (Carroll et al, 1999), an interaction that\nmay be promoted by the Ca2 +-dependent adaptor protein\nhippocalcin (Palmer et al, 2005).\nConsistent with a role for \u2018slot proteins\u2019 in the regulation\nof AMPAR surface levels, LTD has been reported to depend\non PP1-dependent dephosphorylation of stargazin (Tomita\net al, 2005b). This dephosphorylation might permit the\ndissociation of stargazin from PSD-95 and its diffusion out\nof the PSD, enabling LTD through loss of synaptic AMPARs\n(Ziff, 2007). Ubiquitination (Colledge et al, 2003) or\ndepalmitoylation (El-Husseini et al, 2002) of PSD-95 has\nalso been suggested to be critical for agonist-induced\nendocytosis of AMPARs but whether these events are\nrequired for synaptically induced LTD has not been\ndetermined. Additional proteins implicated in AMPAR\nendocytosis include the AMPAR interacting protein PICK1\n(Hanley and Henley, 2005; Kim et al, 2001), the small\nGTPases Rap1 (Zhu et al, 2002, 2005) and Rab5 (Brown\net al, 2005), and a protein termed cpg2 (Cottrell et al, 2004).\nIt has been suggested that particular AMPAR subunits,\nspecifically GluR2, may be especially important for the\nendocytosis of AMPARs during LTD, in part because of its\ndirect interaction with AP2 (Lee et al, 2002). One key\nfinding consistent with this hypothesis is that peptides that\nselectively interfere with this interaction have been reported\nto inhibit LTD (Lee et al, 2002). However, AP2 can bind\nother AMPAR subunits (Kastning et al, 2007; Lee et al,\n2002) and LTD is still observed in hippocampal slices\nobtained from mice lacking GluR2 as well as GluR2 and\nGluR3 (Jia et al, 1996; Meng et al, 2003). Thus, the\nimportance of specific AMPAR subunits for LTD is not\nfirmly established.\nSummary. A current simplified view of the mechanisms\nunderlying NMDAR-dependent LTD can be summarized as\nfollows (Figure 2): a modest increase in postsynaptic\ncalcium concentration within dendritic spines due to\nmodest activation of NMDARs leads to preferential activa-\ntion of protein phosphatases (as well as a few other key\nsignaling proteins). This leads to the dissociation of\nAMPARs from their molecular scaffolds in the PSD and\ntheir lateral movement to endocytic zones on the periphery\nof the PSD, where they are endocytosed and potentially\ndegraded. We have not discussed the maintenance of LTD\nbecause there is little work on this topic. There is evidence\nthat LTD is accompanied by a shrinkage in the size of\ndendritic spines (Nagerl et al, 2004; Zhou et al, 2004) and\nthat this may be due to the loss of AMPARs (Hsieh et al,\n2006). Furthermore, similar to LTP, protein translation may\nbe needed for the long-term stable expression of LTD\n(Pfeiffer and Huber, 2006). Thus, it is generally believed that\nthe activity-dependent trafficking of AMPARs into and out\nof synapses during LTP and LTD, respectively, is the first\ncritical step in the morphological growth or shrinkage of\nsynapses and that these structural modifications are the\nmechanisms by which bidirectional changes in synaptic\nstrength are maintained. Indeed, the size of individual\nsynapses correlates closely with the number of AMPARs\nthey contain (Matsuzaki et al, 2001; Nusser et al, 1998;\nTakumi et al, 1999).\nPresynaptic LTP\nAlthough the spotlight has been on NMDAR-dependent LTP\nfor over 30 years, it is clear that a mechanistically distinct\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n26\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\nform of plasticity coexists in the hippocampus at the so-\ncalled mossy fiber synapses, the synapses between the axons\nof dentate gyrus granule cells (ie, mossy fibers) and the\nproximal apical dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells (Nicoll\nand Malenka, 1995; Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005). Mossy fiber\nLTP (MF-LTP) is of increasing interest due to the fact that it\nappears to be a prototype for mechanistically similar forms\nof LTP found in several other brain regions including the\nthalamus at corticothalamic synapses (Castro-Alamancos\nand Calcagnotto, 1999), the cerebellum at parallel fiber-\nPurkinje cell synapses (Linden, 1997; Salin et al, 1996), and\nperhaps in the striatum at cortico-striatal synapses (Spencer\nand Murphy, 2002). Thus, like NMDAR-dependent LTP,\nthis form of LTP may play multiple functional roles in the\nbrain.\nIn contrast to NMDAR-dependent LTP, the triggering and\nexpression of this form of LTP is thought to be solely or\npredominantly presynaptic, thus we refer to it as presynap-\ntic LTP. While somewhat controversial, most experimental\nevidence suggests that presynaptic LTP is triggered by high-\nfrequency tetanic stimulation, which causes a large, activity-\ndependent increase in calcium concentration within pre-\nsynaptic axon terminals (Nicoll and Malenka, 1995; Nicoll\nand Schmitz, 2005; Zalutsky and Nicoll, 1990). Presynaptic\nvoltage-dependent calcium channels are the critical source\nof the calcium increase, although the triggering of this LTP\nat MF synapses can be facilitated by the activation of\npresynaptic kainate receptors, particularly GluR6 (Lauri\net al, 2001; Schmitz et al, 2003). Results from pharmaco-\nlogical manipulations and knockout mice are all consistent\nwith the hypothesis that the increase in presynaptic calcium\nactivates a calcium/calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase.\nThis leads to a increase in presynaptic cAMP and activation\nof PKA, which phosphorylates critical presynaptic sub-\nstrates to cause a long-lasting enhancement in transmitter\nrelease (Nicoll and Malenka, 1995; Nicoll and Schmitz,\n2005). Although this sequence of events is consistent with\nmost of the results from all of the synapses that have been\nreported to express presynaptic LTP, surprisingly, a very\ndifferent postsynaptic induction mechanism has been\nproposed to occur at MF synapses. This involves trans-\nsynaptic interactions between postsynaptic EphB receptor\ntyrosine kinases and presynaptic B-Ephrin ligands leading,\nvia an unknown mechanism, to a long-lasting enhancement\nof transmitter release (Armstrong et al, 2006; Contractor\net al, 2002).\nDespite some controversy concerning the mechanism\nunderlying the induction of presynaptic LTP at MF\nsynapses, there is general agreement that its expression is\ndue to an increase in neurotransmitter release. One\nmechanism\nfor\nmediating\na\nlong-lasting\nincrease\nin\ntransmitter release is to enhance the calcium influx into\nthe presynaptic terminal when it is invaded by an action\npotential; for example via a long-lasting modulation of\npresynaptic calcium channels. However, direct imaging of\nthe action potential-dependent increase in presynaptic\ncalcium in MF boutons indicates that no change occurs\nfollowing the triggering of MF-LTP (Kamiya et al, 2002;\nRegehr and Tank, 1991; Reid et al, 2004).\nThe other major mechanism for enhancing transmitter\nrelease is via some modulation of the machinery responsible\nfor synaptic vesicle exocytosis. In this context, the focus has\nbeen on presynaptic proteins known to be substrates for\nPKA. Because presynaptic terminals are relatively inacces-\nsible, an important approach has been examining knockout\nmice lacking specific presynaptic proteins. Mice lacking\nsynapsins exhibited normal MF-LTP (Spillane et al, 1995)\nindicating that these prominent PKA substrates were not\nnecessary. In contrast, knockout animals lacking the\nsynaptic vesicle protein Rab3A, a small GTPase (Castillo\net al, 1997; Lonart et al, 1998), or its binding partner, the\nactive zone protein Rim1a (Castillo et al, 2002; Powell et al,\n2004) lack both MF-LTP as well as presynaptic LTP in the\ncerebellum. Rim1a is a substrate of PKA and thus these\nfindings suggest that presynaptic LTP may require a GTP-\ndependent interaction between Rab3a and Rim1a at the\ninterface of synaptic vesicles and the active zone. Indeed,\nusing cultures of cerebellar neurons in which presynaptic\nLTP can be elicited, the critical residue phosphorylated by\nPKA in Rim1a has been identified (Lonart et al, 2003). One\nimportant caveat to this hypothesis, however, is that the\npresynaptic enhancement of synaptic transmission seen\nupon application of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin\nis unaltered in knockout mice lacking Rab3a or Rim1a. This\nprovides a complication for the simple model implicating\nRim1a and Rab3a as the crucial mediators of the enhanced\ntransmission caused by presynaptic activation of PKA.\nMetabotropic Glutamate Receptor-Dependent\nLTD\nUnder the appropriate experimental conditions, low-fre-\nquency stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural\ninputs to CA1 pyramidal cells can trigger, in addition to\nNMDAR-dependent LTD, a mechanistically distinct form of\nLTD, that is dependent upon activation of metabotropic\nglutamate receptors (mGluRs; mGLUR LTD) (Anwyl, 2006;\nBolshakov et al, 2000; Malenka and Bear, 2004; Oliet et al,\n1997). Various forms of mGluR LTD have been observed in\nmany brain regions, most notably at the parallel fiber to\nPurkinje cell synapse (Ito, 1989; Linden and Connor, 1995).\nThis so-called cerebellar LTD is elicited when parallel fibers\nare activated coincident with climbing fiber activation and\nhas been suggested to be particularly important for certain\nforms of motor learning.\nTypically, the induction of mGluR LTD in the CA1 region\nof the hippocampus requires bursts of afferent stimulation\nor paired-pulse stimulation at modest frequencies. Pre-\nsumably, this increases the likelihood of activating the\nextrasynaptic group I mGluRs that are required to trigger\nthis form of plasticity. mGluR LTD can also be elicited by\nbath application of group I mGluR agonists such as DHPG\n(Bellone and Luscher, 2005; Huber et al, 2000, 2001). Group\nI mGluRs (mGluR1 and mGluR5) are defined by their\ncapacity to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis and\nthereby produce diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate.\nAlthough mGluR1 is the principal receptor implicated in the\ninduction of mGluR LTD in the ventral tegmental area\n(VTA), cerebellum, and neostriatum, mGluR5 has been\nimplicated\nin\nthe\nhippocampus,\ncortex,\nand\nnucleus\naccumbens (Anwyl, 2006).\nThe intracellular signaling pathways responsible for\nmGluR LTD have not been extensively examined.

Other signaling\nproteins suggested to be important for mGluR LTD include\nthe MAPKs p38, Erk, and Jnk (Gallagher et al, 2004; Li et al,\n2007; Rush et al, 2002), tyrosine phosphatases (Huang and\nHsu, 2006; Moult et al, 2006), and phosphatidylinositol\n3-kinase (Hou and Klann, 2004) but how these various\nenzymes might lead to a long-lasting decrease in synaptic\nstrength is unknown.\nSimilar to NMDAR-dependent LTD, mGluR LTD in the\nhippocampus and cerebellum appears to involve clathrin-\ndependent endocytosis of AMPARs (Snyder et al, 2001;\nWang and Linden, 2000; Xiao et al, 2001). For cerebellar\nmGluR LTD, a large body of work is consistent with a\nspecific molecular model in which mGluR activation due to\nparallel fiber stimulation combined with calcium influx due\nto climbing fiber activation results in activation of PKCa\nand its targeting to synapses via the protein PICK1 (Jorntell\nand Hansel, 2006; Perez et al, 2001; Steinberg et al, 2006).\nPKCa then phosphorylates Ser880 on GluR2 causing GluR2\nto dissociate from the AMPAR-binding proteins GRIP/ABP\nand bind to PICK1. This then allows lateral diffusion of the\nAMPARs and ultimately internalization (Chung et al, 2003;\nSteinberg et al, 2006; Xia et al, 2000). This cascade of events\nis significantly different than those believed to occur during\nNMDAR-dependent LTD, pointing out that the molecular\nmechanisms underlying apparently similar forms of plasti-\ncity may be cell type-specific. Indeed, mGluR LTD at\nexcitatory synapses onto dopamine cells in the VTA has\nbeen suggested to involve a selective loss of AMPARs that\nlack the GluR2 subunit (Bellone and Luscher, 2005, 2006),\nrather than those that contain GluR2.\nAnother important feature of mGluR LTD, at least in the\nhippocampus, is that it appears to be dependent on mGluR-\ntriggered protein synthesis (Hou and Klann, 2004; Huber\net al, 2000, 2001; Snyder et al, 2001). This link between\nprotein synthesis and mGluR LTD gained considerable\nattention following the report that mice lacking the gene\nencoding the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)\nexhibited enhanced mGluR LTD in both the hippocampus\n(Huber et al, 2002) and the cerebellum (Koekkoek et al,\n2005). These mice serve as a model for the Fragile X\nsyndrome in humans, an X-linked form of mental retarda-\ntion, and exhibit several features of the human disorder\n(Bear et al, 2004). Surprisingly, the enhanced mGluR LTD\nobserved in the FMRP knockout mice is independent of\nprotein synthesis and proteasomal degradation (Hou et al,\n2006; Nosyreva and Huber, 2006), cellular processes that\nappear crucial for mGluR LTD in wild-type mice. Never-\ntheless, this potential link between an mGluR-triggered\nform of synaptic plasticity and Fragile X syndrome has\nfocused\nattention\non\nmGluR\nantagonists\nas\npossible\ntherapeutic agents for this and other developemental\ndisorders (Bear et al, 2004).\nThere are also results consistent with a presynaptic locus\nof expression for mGluR LTD (Anwyl, 2006; Nosyreva and\nHuber, 2005; Zakharenko et al, 2002). As these forms of\nmGluR LTD are still triggered postsynaptically, they must\ninvolve a retrograde messenger, one leading candidate being\n12-lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid (Feinmark\net al, 2003). In an attempt to reconcile the observations of a\npresynaptic locus of expression of mGluR LTD with the\nbulk of the literature describing a postsynaptic locus of\nexpression, a developmental shift in the mechanisms of\nmGluR LTD has been proposed (Nosyreva and Huber,\n2005). Specifically, it has been suggested that in slices\nprepared from neonatal (P8\u2013P15) animals, mGluR-LTD is\nindependent of protein synthesis and is due to a presynaptic\nmodification, whereas in older animals (P21\u2013P35) mGluR\nLTD is mediated by a protein synthesis-dependent reduc-\ntion in the postsynaptic levels of AMPARs.\nEndocannabinoid-Mediated LTD\nA major advance over the last decade has been the\ndemonstration of the existence of endogenous cannabinoids\n(termed endocannabinoids) and their roles in modulating\nsynaptic function (Chevaleyre et al, 2006; Freund et al, 2003;\nKreitzer and Regehr, 2002; Piomelli, 2003; Wilson and\nNicoll, 2002). It is now well established that in a number of\nbrain regions endocannabinoids are retrograde messengers\nthat are released by postsynaptic cells in response to strong\ndepolarization\nand/or\nactivation\nof\nG-protein-coupled\nreceptors (eg, mGluRs and muscarinic receptors) and\nfunction to transiently inhibit transmitter release (for\nB0.5\u20131 min) at either excitatory or inhibitory synpases\nvia activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors.\nMuch of the mechanistic work on the transient synaptic\neffects of endocannabinioids was performed in the hippo-\ncampus and cerebellum, synapses that are often thought to\nbe prototypic of synapses throughout the brain. It was\ntherefore surprising when a form of LTD that required\nendocannabinoids, (so-called endocannabinoid-mediated\nLTD; eCB-LTD) was observed in the glutamatergic synapses\nonto medium spiny neurons in the striatum as well as at\nsynapses between layer V pyramidal neurons (Gerdeman\net al, 2002; Robbe et al, 2002a; Sjostrom et al, 2003). In the\nhippocampus, in contrast, endocannabinoids mediate a\nform of LTD at inhibitory, but not excitatory, synapses\n(Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2004). In the dorsal striatum, eCB-\nLTD requires postsynaptic activation of group I mGluRs,\nL-type calcium channels and D2 dopamine receptors (Choi\nand Lovinger, 1997; Kreitzer and Malenka, 2005, 2007;\nPisani et al, 2005; Sung et al, 2001; Tang et al, 2001)\n(Figure 3). This leads to the production most likely of\nanandamide (Ade and Lovinger, 2007), which activates\npresynaptic CB1 receptors. However, prolonged activation\nof these CB1 receptors alone is not sufficient to elicit eCB-\nLTD; concomitant presynaptic activity is also required, a\nrequirement that likely accounts for the input specificity of\nthis form of plasticity (Singla et al, 2007). Another\nimportant feature of eCB-LTD in the dorsal striatum is\nthat it appears to be restricted to the medium spiny neurons\nthat primarily express D2 dopamine receptors and is not\npresent at excitatory synapses on cells expressing D1\nreceptors (Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007; but see Wang\net al, 2006). This cell-restricted expression of eCB-LTD\nmay have important functional implications, a topic to be\ndiscussed below.\nIn the nucleus accumbens (NAc), eCB-LTD also requires\npostsynaptic activation of group I mGluRs and is modulated\nby drugs of abuse (Fourgeaud et al, 2004; Mato et al, 2004;\nRobbe et al, 2002b). In the cortex, eCB-LTD can be elicited\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n28\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\nby a spike-timing-dependent protocol (Sjostrom et al, 2003)\nbut does not depend on postsynaptic activation of mGluRs\nand surprisingly, requires coincident activation of presy-\nnaptic NMDARs. LTD in the cerebellum was also reported\nto depend on retrograde endocannabinoid signaling (Safo\nand Regehr, 2005), but the mechanistic basis for this\nobservation is still unclear, since, as discussed above,\ncerebellar LTD is expressed postsynaptically.\nMetaplasticity\nMetaplasticity refers to a higher-order form of synaptic\nplasticity in which synaptic activity, which by itself does not\ndirectly affect synaptic efficacy, leads to a persistent change\nin the direction or magnitude of subsequent activity-\ndependent synaptic plasticity. In other words, metaplasti-\ncity is the \u2018plasticity of plasticity\u2019 (Abraham and Bear, 1996;\nBear et al, 1987). The best-studied examples of metaplas-\nticity are those in which prior activity shifts the threshold\nfor LTP and LTD induction. For example, in the hippo-\ncampus, repetitive activation of NMDARs in a manner that\ndoes not elicit LTP or LTD can nonetheless elicit a rapid\nshift in plasticity thresholds such that LTP becomes difficult\nto elicit and LTD induction is favored (Huang et al, 1992;\nWang and Wagner, 1999). A potential functional role for\nmetaplasticity has been demonstrated by modifying the\nlevel of activity during the development of the visual cortex\nin vivo (Philpot et al, 2001, 2003, 2007). This causes shifts in\nthe thresholds for LTP and LTD in cells in visual cortex\npresumably due to changes in the stoichiometry of synaptic\nNMDARs. As discussed below, such changes in synaptic\nplasticity may importantly contribute to the experience-\ndependent plasticity of ocular dominance following mani-\npulation of the visual environment.\nSynaptic Scaling: A Form of Homeostatic\nPlasticity\nTheoretically, without additional stabilizing mechanisms,\nactivity-dependent forms of plasticity such as LTP and LTD\ncould drive neural circuit activity towards epileptogenic\nexcitation or complete quiescence. Synaptic scaling is\nconsidered a form of homeostatic plasticity that counters\npotentially maladaptive effects of long-term synapse-spe-\ncific\nplasticity\nby\nglobally\naffecting\nthe\ntransmission\nthrough all synapses on a given neuron (Turrigiano and\nNelson, 2004). In terms of its basic properties and under-\nlying mechanisms, this form of synaptic plasticity contrasts\ndramatically with the forms of LTP and LTD we have\ndiscussed thus far.\nSynaptic scaling occurs when network activity is drama-\ntically decreased or increased for prolonged (4B12\u201324 h)\nperiods of time. Decreased activity (due to blockade of\nsynaptic transmission or spiking) causes an increase in the\nstrength of all excitatory synapses onto excitatory neurons,\nwhereas increased activity (generally induced by partially\nblocking inhibitory synapses) reduces the strength of all\nexcitatory synapses (Turrigiano et al, 1998). Importantly,\nthe relative strengths of individual synpases appear to be\nmaintained even though global synaptic input is signifi-\ncantly altered.\nRelatively little is known about the molecular mechan-\nisms underlying synaptic scaling other than it involves\nchanges in the number of AMPARs (and NMDARs) at\nindividual synapses (Perez-Otano and Ehlers, 2005; Turri-\ngiano and Nelson, 2004; Watt et al, 2000) and likely\npresynaptic changes as well (Burrone and Murthy, 2003;\nBurrone et al, 2002). Recently, evidence has been presented\nsupporting a role for secreted factors in the induction of\nhomeostatic plasticity, suggesting that key triggers for this\nform of plasticity may not be cell autonomous. Specifically,\nsecretion of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis\nfactor-a from glial cells appears to be necessary for the\nincrease in the level of synaptic AMPARs caused by\nextended periods of activity blockade (Beattie et al, 2002;\nStellwagen et al, 2005; Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006). In\naddition, there is evidence suggesting a role for secreted\nBDNF in driving the opposite form of synaptic scaling; the\ndecrease in synaptic strengths caused by extended periods\nof increased network acitivity (Rutherford et al, 1998;\nTurrigiano, 2006).\nFUNCTIONAL ROLES OF LTP AND LTD\nAlthough LTP and LTD are prime candidate mechanisms\nunderlying many different forms of experience-dependent\nplasticity, it is important to remember that they are\nexperimental phenomena used to examine how different\nCa2+\nAMPAR\nPostsynaptic \ncell\nPresynaptic \nterminal\nLTD\nL-type VSCC\nLipid \nprecursor\neCB\nmGluR1/5\nD2R\nCB1R\nPLC\u03b2?\nFigure 3\nModel of eCB-LTD at excitatory synapses onto medium spiny\nneurons in the striatum.

Co-activation of postsynaptic dopamine D2-type\nreceptors (D2R) enhances endocannabinoid production and the subse-\nquent induction of presynaptic LTD, mediated through activation of\npresynaptic CB1 receptors (CB1R).

Establishing a causal connection between\na specific form of synaptic plasticity and the behavioral\nconsequences of specific experiences remains a daunting\ntask. Nevertheless, over the last decade, significant advances\nhave been made in connecting synaptic plasticity to a\nnumber of different types of adaptive experience-dependent\nplasticity. Furthermore, it has become increasingly clear\nthat understanding the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity\nmay provide important insights into the pathophysiology of\na variety of neuropsychiatric disorders and also point the\nway toward novel therapeutic approaches. In the following\nsections, we will briefly provide examples that demonstrate\nthat LTP and LTD do occur in vivo in response to\nexperience and may play a causal role in mediating the\nconsequences of experience.\nHippocampal-Dependent Plasticity and Learning\nGiven that LTP was first described in the hippocampus, a\nstructure well established to be critically important for\ndeclarative memory (Squire et al, 2004), it is not surprising\nthat over the last three decades there has been a major effort\naimed at demonstrating a role for hippocampal LTP in\nencoding new memories (Martin et al, 2000; Morris, 2006).\nCorrelations have been observed between defective hippo-\ncampal synaptic plasticity and defective hippocampal-\ndependent memory tasks upon perturbation of a number\nof proteins which function in synaptic plasticity, either\npharmacologically, or through gene knockout (Lynch, 2004;\nMartin et al, 2000; Morris, 2006). For example, rodents in\nwhich NMDAR antagonists were infused into the hippo-\ncampus (Morris and Frey, 1997), as well as mice lacking\nexpression of the NMDAR subunit NR1 in the forebrain\n(Tsien et al, 1996), are defective both in LTP and certain\ntypes of spatial learning. Furthermore, mice in which the\nspecific NMDAR subunit NR2B was overexpressed to\nenhance\nNMDAR\nfunction\nwere\nreported\nto\ndisplay\nenhanced LTP and enhanced spatial learning (Tang et al,\n1999). Recently, more compelling evidence for a role of\nsynaptic plasticity in hippocampal-dependent learning has\nbeen presented. During an inhibitory avoidance task, LTP\ncould be recorded in vivo in a subset of hippocampal CA1\npyramidal cells (Whitlock et al, 2006). This demonstrated\nthat the patterns of activity generated during a real learning\ntask were sufficient to elicit LTP. Perhaps even more\nconvincing was the demonstration that in vivo infusion of a\nPKMz\ninhibitor\ninto\nthe\nhippocampus\nabolished\nthe\nmaintenance of LTP and simultaneously the storage of a\nlong-lasting spatial memory (Pastalkova et al, 2006). These\nfindings strongly suggest that maintained LTP was required\nfor the engram that stored the key spatial information.\nIn addition to its role as a key component of the\nmechanisms underlying the encoding of declarative mem-\nories, hippocampal NMDAR-dependent LTP (as well as\nLTD) may provide important insights into the pathophy-\nsiology and potential treatment of major mental illnesses.\nFor example, a leading hypothesis for the pathophysiology\nof schizophrenia posits a dysfunction in glutamatergic\nsynapses, in particular a hypofunction of NMDARs (Coyle\nand Tsai, 2004; Javitt, 2006; McCullumsmith et al, 2004;\nTamminga, 1998). Thus, understanding the signaling events\ndownstream of NMDAR activation may provide important\ninsights into this devastating disease. A role for dysfunc-\ntions in LTP and/or LTD mechanisms as possible con-\ntributors\nto\nschizophrenia\nis\nalso\nattractive\nin\nthat\nschizophrenia likely involves neurodevelopmental abnorm-\nalities (Lewis and Levitt, 2002) and these phenomena play\nan important role in the early postnatal development of\nneural circuitry (see below). Indeed, genetic variation in\ncalcineurin, which is thought to play an important role in\nNMDAR-dependent LTD, has been associated with schizo-\nphrenia (Gerber et al, 2003).\nAnother example of the potential importance of studying\nLTP and LTD comes from investigation into the therapeutic\nmechanisms of drugs used to treat bipolar disorder. Drugs\nsuch as lithium, valproate, and lamotrigine have been\nreported to have significant effects on the phosphorylation\nof AMPAR subunits and affect their surface expression (Du\net al, 2003, 2004, 2007; Gray et al, 2003). These findings\nsuggest that these drugs may somehow tap into the same\nmechanisms that have evolved to generate LTP and LTD\nand also point to novel approaches for the development of\nnew therapeutic agents that may prove efficacious for\ntreatment of this illness.\nExperience-Dependent Plasticity in the\nDeveloping Sensory Cortex\nSensory receptive fields in the cortex are modified by early\npostnatal\nexperience\nand\nthe\nlink\nbetween\nsynaptic\nplasticity and these forms of experience-dependent plasti-\ncity in sensory systems is becoming increasingly established\n(Foeller and Feldman, 2004; Karmarkar and Dan, 2006;\nMalenka and Bear, 2004). For example, a strong connection\nbetween\nsynaptic\nplasticity\nand\nexperience-dependent\nplasticity has been established in the visual system during\nthe shift in ocular dominance caused by monocular\ndeprivation (MD) (Foeller and Feldman, 2004; Karmarkar\nand Dan, 2006; Malenka and Bear, 2004). MD induces\nbiochemical changes in AMPAR subunits in visual cortex\nthat appear identical to those elicited during NMDAR-\ndependent LTD (Heynen et al, 2003) and visual cortical\nslices obtained from monocularly deprived animals show\ngreatly reduced LTD (Crozier et al, 2007; Heynen et al,\n2003), suggesting that LTD was elicited in vivo. Further-\nmore, in vivo recordings demonstrated that MD caused a\nrapid decrease in the visually evoked potential (VEP) from\nthe deprived eye and a slower enhancement of the VEP from\nthe open eye (Frenkel and Bear, 2004). Importantly,\ncompletely blocking activity in the deprived eye prevented\nthe depression of the VEP demonstrating that this depres-\nsion required retinal activity and, like LTD, was therefore\nactivity-dependent (Frenkel and Bear, 2004).\nSimilar results have been obtained in somatosensory\nbarrel cortex in that sensory deprivation by whisker\ntrimming or plucking causes a weakening of synaptic\nresponses in layer 2/3 cells and an occlusion of LTD (Allen\net al, 2003). This appears to be due to alterations in the\npatterns of pre- and postsynaptic spiking in vivo in a\nmanner that is ideal for generating spike-timing-dependent\nLTD (Celikel et al, 2004). LTP mechanisms, on the other\nhand, appear to be important for the strengthening of\nsynapses in developing barrel cortex due to early postnatal\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n30\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\nexperience. In vivo experience drives recombinant GluR1\ninto barrel cortex synapses in a manner similar to that\nwhich occurs during NMDAR-dependent LTP, whereas\nexpression of a short peptide that inhibits delivery of\nendogenous AMPARs blocks the experience-dependent\nincrease in synaptic strength (Takahashi et al, 2003) as\ndoes a dominant-negative form of the synaptic scaffold\nprotein PSD-95 (Ehrlich and Malinow, 2004). Thus, as\npredicted by theoretical considerations (Bienenstock et al,\n1982; Stent, 1973), LTP and LTD mechanisms appear to be\ncritically involved in early neural circuit development and it\nis not difficult\nto\nimagine how disruption\nin these\nmechanisms might contribute to a host of neurodevelope-\nmental disorders such as autism (Geschwind and Levitt,\n2007; Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003).\nSynaptic Plasticity and Fear Conditioning\nPavlovian fear conditioning is a form of associative memory\nthat depends on the amygdala for its induction and\nmaintenance (Sigurdsson et al, 2007). It occurs when a\nneutral stimulus (such as a tone) is temporally paired with a\nstrong noxious stimulus (such as an electric shock) creating\na memory trace, the consequences of which are that the\nneutral stimulus elicits the learned fear response. Consider-\nable evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that LTP at\nsensory inputs to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala is\nnecessary and perhaps sufficient for establishing this\nengram (Sigurdsson et al, 2007). NMDAR-dependent LTP\ncan be induced at cortical and thalamic inputs into the\nlateral amygdala, both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, fear\nconditioning induces synaptic potentiation at these sy-\nnapses, and this increase in synaptic strength occludes\nfurther induction of LTP (McKernan and Shinnick-Galla-\ngher, 1997; Rogan et al, 1997; Tsvetkov et al, 2002). Like\nNMDAR-dependent LTP in the hippocampus, fear con-\nditioning has also been shown to lead to the insertion of\nnew AMPARs at thalamic input synapses onto lateral\namygdala neurons (Rumpel et al, 2005) and perhaps most\nconvincingly, expression of a peptide that prevents the LTP-\ninduced incorporation of AMPARs at synapses abolished\nacquisition of this form of associative memory (Rumpel\net al, 2005).\nNMDARs in the amgydala are also involved in the\nextinction of learned fear, which can be conceptualized as a\ndifferent form of learning (Myers and Davis, 2002).\nFurthermore, acute treatment with D-cycloserine, a partial\nagonist of NMDARs, enhances the learning processes that\nare responsible for fear extinction via actions in the\namygdala (Walker et al, 2002). On the basis of these\nobservations, clinical trials have been initiated using D-\ncycloserine in combination with behavioral therapy to\nenhance the extinction of fear in phobic patients (Hofmann\net al, 2006; Otto et al, 2007; Ressler et al, 2004). Results to\ndate suggest that the administration of D-cycloserine either\nbefore or shortly after exposure to fearful cues does in fact\nenhance the extinction of the anxiety previously associated\nwith specific cues. Thus, the study of the neural substrates\nof learned fear and its extinction is a compelling example of\nhow research on the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity has\ndirectly led to a potential novel treatment for common\npsychiatric disorders.\nSynaptic Plasticity in Dopamine Circuits\nThe defining characteristic of drug addiction is persistent\nand compulsive seeking and ingestion of drugs despite\nadverse consequences. Over the last decade, a leading\nhypothesis has been that an important neural substrate\nof\naddiction,\nin\nparticular\nrelapse,\nis\nlong-term\nassociative memory processes occurring in several neural\ncircuits\nthat\nreceive\ninput\nfrom\nmidbrain\ndopamine\nneurons (Everitt and Robbins, 2005; Hyman et al, 2006).\nIn other words, it is thought that addictive drugs can usurp\nthe normal adaptive mechanisms underlying reward-based\nlearning.\nThe most well-established key site of action of addictive\ndrugs is the mesolimbic dopamine system consisting of the\nVTA and the NAc. Excitatory synaptic transmission in these\nstructures is critical for mediating several forms of long-\nlasting, drug-induced behavioral plasticity (Everitt and\nWolf, 2002; Hyman and Malenka, 2001). It, therefore, has\nbeen reasonable to hypothesize that plasticity at these\nsynapses plays an important role in mediating some of the\nbehavioral consequences of exposure to drugs of abuse\n(Wolf, 1998).\nIndeed, it is now established that various forms of LTP\nand LTD can be elicited at excitatory synapses in the VTA\nand NAc (Gerdeman et al, 2003; Kauer, 2004; Kelley, 2004;\nThomas and Malenka, 2003). Furthermore, administration\nof a single dose of several different classes of drugs of abuse\ncauses\na significant increase\nin synaptic strength at\nexcitatory synapses onto dopamine cells in the VTA (Faleiro\net al, 2004; Saal et al, 2003; Ungless et al, 2001). This\nincrease shares mechanisms with LTP in the VTA and\nappears to involve upregulation of AMPARs (Ungless et al,\n2001). This drug-induced \u2018LTP\u2019 appears to play a functional\nrole in triggering or mediating some drug-induced beha-\nvioral adaptations, as both conditioned place preference\nand behavioral sensitization are blocked by injection of\nglutamate receptor antagonists into the VTA (Harris and\nAston-Jones, 2003; Vanderschuren and Kalivas, 2000). In\naddition, conditioned place preference, as well as the\nsynaptic potentiation that is observed following cocaine\nadministration, are impaired in GluR1 knockout mice\n(Dong et al, 2004), with the caveat that these mice still\nexhibit robust behavioral sensitization in response to\nrepeated exposure to psychostimulants (Dong et al, 2004;\nVekovischeva et al, 2001).\nWhile drugs of abuse have been observed to induce LTP\nin the VTA, LTD has been observed in the NAc following\nchronic in vivo cocaine administration (Thomas et al,\n2001). Consistent with a functional role for this LTD in\naddiction, injection of glutamate receptor antagonists into\nthe NAc abolishes the expression of behavioral sensitization\n(Kelley, 2004). Furthermore, amphetamine-induced beha-\nvioral sensitization and LTD in the NAc were both abolished\nby injection into the NAc of inhibitors of AMPAR\nendocytosis (Brebner et al, 2005). Interestingly, overexpres-\nsion of GluR1 in the NAc (mimicking an \u2018LTP\u2019-like\ncondition) facilitates the extinction of cocaine-seeking\n(Sutton et al, 2003) and even makes cocaine aversive in a\nconditioned place preference assay (Kelz et al, 1999).\nRecently, it has also been reported that cocaine self-\nadministration abolishes the ability to induce LTD in the\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n31\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\ncore of the NAc after prolonged (21 days) abstinence\n(Martin\net\nal,\n2006)\nand\nin\nvivo\nadministration\nof\ntetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cocaine impairs the gene-\nration of eCB-LTD (Fourgeaud et al, 2004; Mato et al, 2004;\nRobbe et al, 2002b). Thus, drugs of abuse may elicit certain\nforms of synaptic plasticity in specific circuits while\nsimultaneously impairing plasticity in other circuits.\nSynaptic plasticity in the dorsal striatum has also been\ncorrelated with certain learned behaviors, in particular in\nmotor control (Gubellini et al, 2004; Pisani et al, 2005). In\nthis context, it is important to note that two independent\nstriatal circuits are thought to exist, the so-called \u2018direct\u2019\nand \u2018indirect\u2019 pathways, which subserve different functions\nin motor control (Bolam et al, 2000). Indirect pathway\nmedium spiny neurons (MSNs) project to the lateral globus\npallidus and primarily express D2 dopamine receptors while\ndirect pathway MSNs project to the substantia nigra and\nexpress D1 dopamine receptors. As mentioned in the\nsection on eCB-LTD, this form of plasticity is primarily\nrestricted to the indirect pathway MSNs and is absent in\nParkinson\u2019s disease models (Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007).\nHowever,\nin\nslices\nfrom\ndopamine-depleted\nanimals,\nindirect pathway eCB-LTD can be rescued by a D2 receptor\nagonist or pharmacological inhibitors of endocannabinoid\ndegradation. Remarkably, administration of these drugs\ntogether in vivo dramatically reduces Parkinsonian motor\ndeficits suggesting that endocannabinoid-mediated depres-\nsion of indirect pathway synapses has a critical role in\nmotor control and may be a valuable target for therapy of\nstriatal-based brain disorders (Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007).\nThis works also points out the potential power of examining\nthe mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and placing them in\nthe context of the neural circuits in which they are found.\nFuture Directions\nWe have attempted to briefly review the enormous field of\nsynaptic plasticity research in a concise and accessible\nmanner so that by the end of this article, readers will have a\nreasonably up to date knowledge of current thinking about\nthe mechanisms underlying the major forms of synaptic\nplasticity in the mammalian brain and a sense of what their\nin vivo functions might be. By necessity we have had to\nleave out important topics such as how synaptic activity\nmodulates NMDAR-mediated synaptic responses (eg, Mor-\nishita et al, 2005), inhibitory synaptic responses (Chevaleyre\net al, 2006), or the intrinsic excitability of neurons (Xu and\nKang, 2005; Zhang and Linden, 2003), all of which will have\nprofound effects on neural circuit function. Furthermore,\nseveral\ncompelling\nexamples\nthat\ncorrelate\nlong-term\nsynaptic plasticity with experience-dependent modifications\nin behavior have been left out, such as the role of cerebellar\nLTD in motor learning (Boyden et al, 2004; Ito, 2002;\nJorntell and Hansel, 2006).\nThis review should also make clear that while extensive\nprogress has been made, much remains unknown. Even for\nthe most established forms of plasticity, NMDAR-depen-\ndent LTP and LTD in the CA1 region of the hippocampus,\nwe\nstill\nknow\nlittle\nabout\nthe\ndetails\nof\nthe\nsignal\ntransduction pathways triggering these forms of plasticity\nand which specific proteins are being modified to cause the\nchanges in synaptic efficacy. We also know little about the\nmolecular mechanisms underlying the structural changes in\nsynapses that seem to accompany LTP and LTD. With the\naccumulation of evidence demonstrating that long-term\nsynaptic modifications do in fact play important roles in a\nhost of adaptive brain functions, we believe there is strong\njustification to continue efforts toward establishing the\ndetailed molecular basis of the various forms of synaptic\nplasticity. This is particularly important because, as we have\ntried to make clear, such knowledge is likely to have a major\nimpact on our understanding and treatment of a wide range\nof brain disorders.\nWhat direction do we envision the field taking in the near\nfuture? By definition, synaptic plasticity is an electrophy-\nsiological phenomenon. Only by recording synaptic re-\nsponses can the investigator be sure that synaptic function\nhas been modified. Until relatively recently, most electro-\nphysiological studies depended on pharmacological manip-\nulations of proteins, an approach that was aided by the use\nof genetically modified mice. Thus far, gene knockout\nexperiments addressing the function of B200 genes have\nbeen reported and close to 80% of these report effects on\nsynaptic transmission or plasticity (Grant, 2006). With the\ngrowing consensus that NMDAR-dependent LTP is primar-\nily mediated by an increase in postsynaptic AMPARs, while\nLTD is associated with loss of AMPARs from the PSD, there\nalso has been an increased contribution of cell biologists\nwho have focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying\nthe changes in the levels of postsynaptic receptors as well as\nthe changes in synaptic structure that occur. Indeed, a close\ninterdependence has emerged between electrophysiologists\nand cell biologists and this has dramatically impacted the\nfield. Thus, electrophysiologists are increasingly making use\nof tools that enable overexpression, knockdown, and\nmolecular replacement of target proteins both in vitro and\nin vivo (eg, Schluter et al, 2006). These advances are\nenabling a true molecular dissection of the mechanisms\nunderlying plasticity of mammalian brain synapses.\nRecent advances in high-throughput technologies, such as\ngene-chip microarrays for mRNA profiling and advanced\nmass spectrometry for identification of multiple proteins in\na mixed population, have enabled the identification of the\nmolecular components of many biological phenomena and\ncontributed significantly to understanding their regulation.\nFurthermore, the recent advent of \u2018systems biology\u2019 has\ncontributed a number of conceptual advances that enable\nclearer interpretation of the complex interaction networks\nobserved in signal transduction cascades (Alon, 2006).\nThese advances have so far only lightly impacted the field of\nsynaptic plasticity (Pocklington et al, 2006), but we envision\nthat they will have increasing influence in the near future,\ndespite the technical difficulties that are encountered when\ntrying to apply these approaches to the inherently complex\npreparations used in the study of synaptic plasticity.\nWhat might we gain from such studies? A clearer picture\nof the molecules which participate in the processes under-\nlying the different forms of synaptic plasticity, and the\ndynamics of their activation and interactions, would enable\nthe formulation of much more sophisticated models of the\nevents underlying the triggering, expression, and main-\ntenance of specific forms of synaptic plasticity. This in turn\nwould create a strong foundation for focused efforts aimed\nat identifying the central pathways mediating synaptic\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n32\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\nplasticity and assaying their relevance to the phenomenon\nmeasured electrophysiologically.\nBy combining electrophysiological, molecular, cell biolo-\ngical and proteomic approaches, we envision that the next\nfew decades will bring further clarification of the detailed\nmolecular mechanisms underlying the major forms of\nsynaptic plasticity that we have discussed in this review.\nThe use of more sophisticated molecular and genetic\nmanipulations, in particular, the development of mouse\nlines with highly restricted expression of transgenes that\ncan be turned on or off with fine temporal control, will\nsimultaneously facilitate the examination of the neural\ncircuit basis of behavior.

Saltiel1,3\n1Life Sciences Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. 2Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases and  \n3Departments of Internal Medicine and Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.\nAdipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) infiltrate adipose tissue during obesity and contribute to insulin resis-\ntance. We hypothesized that macrophages migrating to adipose tissue upon high-fat feeding may differ from \nthose that reside there under normal diet conditions. To this end, we found a novel F4/80+CD11c+ population \nof ATMs in adipose tissue of obese mice that was not seen in lean mice. ATMs from lean mice expressed many \ngenes characteristic of M2 or \u201calternatively activated\u201d macrophages, including Ym1, arginase 1, and Il10. Diet-\ninduced obesity decreased expression of these genes in ATMs while increasing expression of genes such as \nthose encoding TNF-\u03b1 and iNOS that are characteristic of M1 or \u201cclassically activated\u201d macrophages. Interest-\ningly, ATMs from obese C-C motif chemokine receptor 2\u2013KO (Ccr2-KO) mice express M2 markers at levels similar \nto those from lean mice. The antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10, which was overexpressed in ATMs from lean \nmice, protected adipocytes from TNF-\u03b1\u2013induced insulin resistance. Thus, diet-induced obesity leads to a shift \nin the activation state of ATMs from an M2-polarized state in lean animals that may protect adipocytes from \ninflammation to an M1 proinflammatory state that contributes to insulin resistance.\nIntroduction\nRecent investigations suggest that obesity gives rise to a state \nof chronic, low-grade inflammation that contributes to insulin \nresistance and type 2 diabetes (1, 2). Although the tissues and cell \ntypes involved in this inflammatory response are not fully under-\nstood, there is significant interest in the role of adipose tissue \nmacrophages (ATMs) in the inflammatory changes characteristic \nof obesity (3). In both humans and rodents, ATMs accumulate \nin adipose tissue with increasing body weight and their quantity \ncorrelates with measures of insulin resistance (4\u20136). In obese sub-\njects, ATM content is higher in visceral than subcutaneous adi-\npose tissue, consistent with the hypothesis that visceral fat plays \na more prominent role in insulin resistance (7). Moreover, weight \nloss leads to a reduction in both inflammatory markers and ATM \ncontent (4, 7). ATMs are a prominent source of proinflammatory \ncytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 that can block insulin action in \nadipocytes, providing a potential link between inflammation and \ninsulin resistance (6, 8).\nMouse models have demonstrated that ATMs are both neces-\nsary and sufficient for the development of insulin resistance with \nobesity. Mice with targeted deletions in the genes for monocyte \nchemoattractant protein\u20131 (Mcp1/Ccl2) and its receptor C-C motif \nchemokine receptor 2 (Ccr2) both have decreased ATM content, \ndecreased inflammation in fat, and protection from high-fat \ndiet\u2013induced (HFD-induced) insulin resistance (9, 10). Converse-\nly, mice overexpressing MCP-1 have increased numbers of ATMs \nalong with increased insulin resistance (9, 11). Moreover, myeloid-\nspecific KO of I\u03baB kinase \u03b2 (Ikbkb) produced mice with improved \ninsulin sensitivity on HFD (12). Together, these data suggest that \nboth the recruitment and proinflammatory activation of ATMs \nare required for the development of diabetes with obesity.\nWhile quantitative changes in ATM content with obesity and \ndiabetes are well supported, little is known about the range of \nATM function and how this may change with obesity. ATMs are \npresent in moderate quantities in adipose tissue of lean mice \nin which inflammatory signals are low or nonexistent (5, 6), \nand their role there is unclear. While Ccr2-KO (CCR2KO) and \nMcp1-KO mice have lower inflammatory cytokine expression \nin fat, they retain significant macrophage content within adi-\npose tissue (9, 10). This suggests that factors both dependent \nand independent of the MCP-1/CCR2 axis are involved in mac-\nrophage recruitment to fat and, further, that not all ATMs are \nprogrammed for proinflammatory signaling.\nMacrophages show significant heterogeneity in function, as local \nenvironmental factors shape their properties and activation state \n(13, 14). Different stimuli activate macrophages to express distinct \npatterns of chemokines, surface markers, and metabolic enzymes \nthat ultimately generate the diversity of macrophage function seen \nin inflammatory and noninflammatory settings. Macrophage acti-\nvation has been operationally defined across 2 separate polarization \nstates, M1 and M2 (13, 14). These states have largely been defined \nin vitro, and tissue macrophages are likely activated along a con-\ntinuum between these states in vivo. M1 or \u201cclassically activated\u201d \nmacrophages are induced by proinflammatory mediators such as \nLPS and IFN-\u03b3. M1 macrophages have enhanced proinflammatory \ncytokine production (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-12) and generate reactive oxy-\ngen species such as NO via activation of iNOS (Nos2).\nM2 or \u201calternatively activated\u201d macrophages are generated in \nvitro by exposure to IL-4 and IL-13 (15). M2 macrophages have \nlow proinflammatory cytokine expression and instead generate \nhigh levels of antiinflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-1 decoy \nreceptor. Additionally, arginase production is increased in M2-\npolarized macrophages. This enzyme blocks iNOS activity by a \nvariety of mechanisms, including competing for the arginine sub-\nstrate that is required for NO production (16).

M2 \npolarization can occur in the absence of IL-4 or IL-13, suggesting \nthat this state may be induced by several different factors (17). \nMoreover, recent studies have shown that IL-4\u2013mediated M2 \npolarization is associated with the activation of transcription fac-\ntors involved in lipid oxidative metabolism that include PPAR\u03b3 \nand PPAR\u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b2 (PGC-1\u03b2) (18).\nIn mice, distinct monocyte subsets contribute to tissue inflam-\nmatory responses (13, 19). Noninflamed tissues are populated \nwith macrophages derived from CX3CR1hiCCR2\u2013 monocytes \n(20). In contrast, acute inflammation increases the levels of \nCX3CR1loCCR2+Ly-6Chi monocytes, which have a higher capac-\nity for migration into inflamed tissues compared with other \nmonocyte populations (21). This model is consistent with obser-\nvations that CCR2KO mice have decreased ATM content (10), \npresumably due to deficient recruitment of CX3CR1loCCR2+ \nmonocytes with retention of the trafficking of CX3CR1hiCCR2\u2013 \nmonocytes into adipose tissue.\nThe qualitative differences between these monocyte/macrophage \nsubtypes in ATMs and obesity are unknown but may be impor-\ntant in understanding the biology of these unique cells and their \ncontribution to diabetes. In this regard, we show here that ATMs \nundergo a phenotypic switch from an antiinflammatory M2 polar-\nization state to a proinflammatory M1 polarization state upon \nhigh-fat feeding, in the process losing their protective capacity.\nResults\nF4/80+CD11b+CD11c+ macrophages accumulate in fat with diet-induced \nobesity. As the majority of previous studies have used F4/80 expres-\nsion as a single marker to identify ATMs, we sought to examine \nATM heterogeneity in lean and obese mice using additional known \nmacrophage markers. Epididymal fat tissue plays a significant role \nin overall metabolism in rodents (22). We thus isolated stromal \nvascular fraction (SVF) cells from epididymal fat pads excised from \nmale mice fed a normal diet (ND) or HFD and analyzed cells by \nflow cytometry. ATMs from both lean and obese mice coexpressed \nF4/80 and CD11b, and the majority of the F4/80+CD11b+ cells \nalso expressed Mac-3 (data not shown). However, there was varia-\ntion in the amount of CD11c expression within the F4/80+CD11b+ \nATMs. The SVF from lean mice contained 17.8% F4/80+ cells, con-\nsistent with other reports (5). Only a small percentage of these cells \ncoexpressed CD11c (9.3% \u00b1 7.5%; n = 3 pools of mice) (Figure 1A). \nIn contrast, obese mice contained increased F4/80+ cell content \nwithin the SVF, with a significant increase in the percentage of \nF4/80+CD11c+ cells (38.4% \u00b1 15% of F4/80+ cells; P = 0.04 versus \nlean mice). These cells also expressed CD11b. Similar results were \nseen in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, with 74% of the F4/80+ cells \ncoexpressing CD11c (data not shown).\nThe total number of both F4/80+CD11c+ cells (4.52 \u00b1 1.1 \u00d7 106 \ncells/mouse versus 0.196 \u00b1 0.16 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse; P = 0.021) \nand F4/80+CD11c\u2013 cells (1.98 \u00b1 0.42 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse versus \n9.69 \u00b1 8.2 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse; P = 0.24) isolated from epididymal \nFigure 1\nAccumulation of F4/80+CD11c+ ATMs in adipose \ntissue in obese mice.

Normalizing this data to fat pad weight indicated \nthat there was a 5.5-fold increase in the content of F4/80+CD11c+ \ncells in adipose tissue from HFD-fed compared with ND mice \n(Figure 1C). In contrast, there was no significant change in the \nquantity of F4/80+CD11c\u2013 cells in adipose tissue per milligram \nfat weight between ND and HFD mice. This demonstrates that \nF4/80+CD11c+ cells are a specific population of ATMs recruited \nto fat tissue upon HFD exposure.\nPrevious studies indicated that targeted deletion of the Ccr2 gene \nresults in decreased macrophage content in adipose tissue and \nimproved insulin sensitivity (10). Thus, CCR2KO mice were also \nexamined for CD11c expression as a complementary mouse model. \nHFD-fed CCR2KO mice demonstrated a reduction in the content \nof F4/80+CD11c+ cells in the SVF compared with wild-type obese \nmice, with 14.4% \u00b1 9.2% of the F4/80+ cells coexpressing CD11c \n(P = 0.08 versus HFD C57BL/6) (Figure 1D). Normalizing for cell \nnumber and fat weight indicated that there was a greater than 50% \nreduction in the level of F4/80+CD11c+ ATMs in the CCR2KO mice \n(HFD C57BL/6, 2.4 \u00b1 0.46 \u00d7 103 cells/mg versus HFD CCR2KO, \n0.88 \u00b1 0.98 \u00d7 103 cells/mg) (Figure 1C). The content of total \nF4/80+CD11c+ cells in fat pads from HFD CCR2KO mice was also \nlower than in obese controls after normalization to cell number \n(Figure 1B). Similar to what was observed previously (10), adipo-\ncyte size was increased in HFD CCR2KO mice compared with con-\ntrol HFD mice (mean 7,933 \u00b1 2,754 \u03bcm2 versus 6,704 \u00b1 2,961 \u03bcm2, \u2002\nP = 0.041) and HFD CCR2KO mice were protected from hepatic \nsteatosis (data not shown). Contrary to these observations, how-\never, we noted increased fat pad weight in HFD CCR2KO mice \u2002\n(2.83 \u00b1 0.57 g versus control, 1.41 \u00b1 0.25 g; P = 0.011).\nImmunofluorescence microscopy confirmed the flow cytometry \nresults; ND SVF cultures contained only F4/80+CD11c\u2013 cells (Fig-\nure 2A). SVF cells from HFD mice showed a mix of F4/80+CD11c+ \nand F4/80+CD11c\u2013 cells. Immunohistochemistry on epididymal \nfat pads from obese mice localized CD11c+ cells in macrophage \nclusters surrounding adipocytes (Figure 2B). The CD11c antibody \nstained a subset of cells in these crownlike structures, while F4/80 \nstained nearly all of the cells in these clusters. Scattered individual \nCD11c+ ATMs were observed surrounding adipocytes in what may \nhave been early ATM clusters (Figure 2C). Rare CD11c+ cells were \nseen in adipose tissue sections from lean mice.\nIncreased inflammatory gene expression in F4/80+CD11c+ ATMs. \nBecause CD11c+ cells appear to accumulate in adipose tissue after \nhigh-fat feeding, we assessed expression of inflammatory genes in \nF4/80+CD11c+ ATMs compared with F4/80+CD11c\u2013 ATMs from \nobese mice. Real-time RT-PCR showed appropriate sorting of the \nCD11c populations based on expression of integrin, alpha X (Itgax, \nencoding CD11c) (Figure 3). F4/80+CD11c+ cells overexpressed \nthe inflammatory genes Il6 (IL-6) and Nos2 (iNOS) compared with \nF4/80+CD11c\u2013 ATMs. Tnfa (TNF-\u03b1) was not differentially expressed \nbetween the cell types, while Apoe (apoE) was downregulated in the \nF4/80+CD11c+ population relative to F4/80+CD11c\u2013 cells.\nATMs from lean mice express markers of alternatively activated mac-\nrophages. Given the low level of inflammatory cytokine expression \nin adipose tissue from lean mice, we examined the ATMs derived \nfrom lean mice for known markers of alternatively activated M2 \nFigure 2\nCD11c+ ATMs in SVF cultures and in adipose tissue from obese mice. \n(A) Identification of F4/80+ and CD11c+ ATMs by immunofluorescence \nmicroscopy. Epididymal fat pads from ND and HFD mice were sepa-\nrated into adipocyte and SVF fractions. SVF cells were plated onto \nglass coverslips and cultured overnight prior to fixation. Cells were \nstained with antibodies against F4/80 (left) and CD11c (middle) and \nimaged by confocal microscopy to identify surface markers to confirm \nthe presence of CD11c+ cells only in the SVF from HFD-fed animals. \nSimilar results were obtained for 3 independent sets of cultures.

ATMs from lean animals showed increased \nexpression of M2-specific genes Il10 (IL-10), Arg1 (arginase I), Mrc2 \n(mannose receptor, C type 2), Ym1/Chi3l3 (Ym1/chitinase 3\u2013like 3),  \nand Mgl1/2 (macrophage galactose N-acetyl-galactosamine\u2013spe-\ncific lectins 1 and 2) compared with the ATMs isolated from HFD \nmice (Figure 4A). In contrast, expression of proinflammatory \ngenes such as Tnfa and Nos2 was considerably lower in ND ATMs \ncompared with ATMs from obese animals (Figure 4B).\nAs macrophages make up only a portion of the stromal cells in \nadipose tissue, we examined expression of some of these genes in \nunsorted SVF isolates. Similar patterns of gene expression were \nseen in RNA prepared from SVF cells from lean and obese mice \n(Figure 4, C and D), with increased Ym1 and Il10 expression in ND \nmice and increased Tnfa and Nos2 expression in HFD mice.\nSince inflammatory macrophage recruitment into fat tissue \nappears to be partially dependent on CCR2 (10), we hypothesized \nthat ATMs in obese CCR2KO mice might retain properties of \nM2-polarized macrophages and thus evaluated gene expression \nin these cells. Indeed, ATMs isolated from obese CCR2KO mice \nexpressed alternatively activated macrophage markers at levels that \nwere similar to those seen in ATMs from lean mice. Furthermore, \nthese were significantly elevated compared with levels in ATMs \nfrom obese mice (Figure 4A).\nWe confirmed gene expression data by examining protein lev-\nels in the ATMs under study. Consistent with the RNA expression \ndata, Ym1 was increased in SVF samples from lean compared with \nobese mice (Figure 4E). Additionally, purification of CD11b+ ATMs \nfrom SVF samples indicated that Ym1 is predominantly expressed \nin ATMs compared with non-macrophage CD11b\u2013 cells.\nAnother characteristic of the alternative macrophage activa-\ntion state is increased arginase activity (15). Arginase activity was \nassessed in SVF and adipocyte samples from lean and obese mice. \nWhile the activity of this enzyme did not differ between the iso-\nlated adipocytes from lean and obese mice, arginase activity was \nsignificantly diminished in the SVF fraction after HFD exposure \n(Figure 4F). This indicates that the arginase/iNOS balance in \nATMs from lean animals is skewed toward an immunosuppres-\nsive state that changes to a proinflammatory state with obesity \n(elevated iNOS and repressed arginase activity).\nIL-10 protects adipocytes from the deleterious effects of TNF-\u03b1. The \nobservation that the expression of Il10 is higher in the SVF and \nATMs from lean compared with obese mice led us to examine the \neffects of the cytokine on adipocyte function. To explore the cellu-\nlar effects of IL-10, we first examined the expression of its receptor. \nThe IL-10 receptor \u03b1 (IL-10R\u03b1) was detected in adipose tissue by \nimmunoblotting (Figure 5A). Separation of the SVF from adipo-\ncytes in lean and obese animals indicated that the IL-10 receptor \nwas expressed primarily in adipocytes, with minimal expression \nin the SVF (Figure 5B). No significant differences were seen in \u2002\nIL-10R\u03b1 expression between lean and obese mice.\nWe next examined IL-10 signaling in differentiated 3T3-L1 adi-\npocytes. STAT3 phosphorylation by the IL-10 receptor has been \nshown to be required for its antiinflammatory effects (24). Treat-\nment of adipocytes with IL-10 led to the tyrosine phosphorylation \nof STAT3 within 5 minutes. This effect peaked at 10 minutes and \ndeclined thereafter (Figure 5C). As IL-10 as been shown to activate \nthe PI3K pathway via insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins (25), \nwe examined phosphorylation of Akt in response to IL-10. IL-10 \ntreatment of adipocytes produced the rapid serine phosphoryla-\ntion of Akt (Figure 5C).\nIL-10 has a variety of antiinflammatory effects in macrophages \nand other cell types that includes the antagonism of the actions of \nTNF-\u03b1 (26). To examine this in adipocytes, we first analyzed the \neffect of IL-10 on the secretion of the chemokine MCP-1, thought \nto be a major attractant for macrophages in states of obesity (9, \n11, 27). IL-10 treatment for 16 hours decreased MCP-1 secretion \nfrom adipocytes (Figure 6A). As reports suggest that IL-10 may \nmediate its antiinflammatory effects by antagonizing activation \nof NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated gene transcription (28), we examined the \neffects of IL-10 on TNF-\u03b1\u2013stimulated NF-\u03baB activity using an \nNF-\u03baB\u2013responsive luciferase reporter gene. While TNF-\u03b1 induced \nreporter gene expression, IL-10 had no effect upon this activation \n(data not shown). This is consistent with other reports that show \nthat IL-10 can alter the transcriptional rate of inflammatory genes \nindependent of NF-\u03baB activation (29).\nWe next examined the effects of IL-10 on insulin signal \ntransduction in adipocytes in concert with TNF-\u03b1. Treatment \nof cells with TNF-\u03b1 for 6 hours dramatically reduced the levels \nof glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) protein, with a smaller reduc-\ntion in the level of insulin receptor expression, similar to what has \nbeen reported previously (30). IL-10 pretreatment prevented the \nTNF-\u03b1\u2013induced downregulation of both proteins (Figure 6B). \nAdditionally, insulin-stimulated IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation \nwas decreased with TNF-\u03b1 treatment. This inhibitory effect was \nprevented by pretreatment with IL-10 (Figure 6C). IL-10 treat-\nment produced no significant changes in TNF-\u03b1\u2013stimulated IRS1 \nphosphorylation at Ser307, suggesting that the antagonism of \u2002\nTNF-\u03b1 action by IL-10 occurs either downstream of or in parallel \nto reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1.\nTo determine whether IL-10 protects adipocytes from the physi-\nological effects of TNF-\u03b1, we examined insulin-stimulated glucose \nuptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with and without IL-10 pretreatment. \nTreatment of cells with TNF-\u03b1 for 3 hours produced a significant, \n30%\u201340% inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Pre-\ntreatment of the cells with IL-10 for 24 hours blocked these acute \ninhibitory effects of TNF-\u03b1 (Figure 7A). Prolonged (72-hour), low-\ndose TNF-\u03b1 treatment increased basal glucose uptake but had no \neffect on insulin-stimulated levels, consistent with a dramatic \nupregulation of the glucose transporter GLUT1 under these con-\nFigure 3\nIncreased inflammatory gene expression in F4/80+CD11c+ ATMs. SVF \ncells were isolated from HFD-fed male C57BL/6 mice (n = 3) and stained \nfor F4/80 and CD11c.

IL-10 blocked these effects of TNF-\u03b1 and maintained \ncells in an insulin-sensitive state (Figure 7B). Moreover, insulin-\nstimulated glucose uptake was dramatically enhanced in cells \nchronically treated with IL-10 compared with untreated cells.\nDiscussion\nRecent data suggest that obesity may represent a state of chron-\nic, low-grade inflammation and that overnutrition is associated \nwith the infiltration of adipose tissue by inflammatory cells (2). \nAlthough the precise cell types involved in this process remain \nuncertain, evidence is mounting that implicates ATMs as a sig-\nnificant contributor to inflammation in obesity and a mediator \nof insulin resistance (3, 9, 32). Because the properties of ATMs are \nnot well characterized, we performed a detailed examination of \nATM subtypes and their gene expression in obese and lean mice. \nBased on the wide range of functions that macrophages display in \nnormal and inflamed tissues (33), we hypothesized that ATMs are \ndifferentially activated depending on the degree of adiposity and, \nfurther, that in addition to quantitative differences, qualitative \ndifferences exist between ATMs in lean and obese animals.\nWe report here that ATMs isolated from white adipose tissue \nfrom lean animals express hallmarks of polarization toward an \nalternatively activated state (M2), suggesting a potentially ben-\neficial function of these cells. M2 polarization has been described \nin tumor-associated macrophages and parasitic infections and is \nbelieved to regulate tissue repair and prevent excess inflammation \n(15, 34). The markers of M2-polarized macrophages are still being \ndescribed but include expression of the chitinase family member \nYm1, the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10, arginase, and surface \nlectins Mgl1 and Mgl2 (15, 23). The genes encoding all of these pro-\nteins were overexpressed in ATMs from lean compared with obese \nmice. Moreover, ATMs from obese CCR2KO mice, which display \nsignificantly lower inflammatory gene expression compared with \ntheir wild-type counterparts, express M2 markers at levels compa-\nrable to those in lean mice. This observation is consistent with the \nevidence that resident tissue macrophages in normal conditions \nare derived from CCR2\u2013 monocytes, while macrophages recruited \nto sites of inflammation are derived from CCR2+ monocytes (20).\nIn the current paradigm of macrophage polarization, the prop-\nerties of M2 macrophages contrast with the proinflammatory \nactivities of classically activated M1 macrophages. One important \ndifference between these polarization states involves the balance \nbetween arginase and iNOS activities. Arginase and iNOS both uti-\nlize l-arginine as a substrate. However, while iNOS generates reac-\ntive NO species with microbicidal and proinflammatory effects \nimportant in immune responses, arginase competes with iNOS for \narginine as a substrate and generates l-ornithine, an important \nprecursor for proline that enhances collagen biosynthesis (16). \nFigure 4\nIncreased expression of markers of alternatively activated (M2) macrophages in ATMs from lean ND-fed mice.

This balance in favor of arginase \nmay play a critical role in repressing the generation of NO and \nother reactive oxygen species by iNOS and thus maintain adipo-\ncyte function and promote tissue repair and remodeling.\nThe dramatic differences in IL-10 expression in lean compared \nwith obese ATMs imply an important role for this cytokine as a \nhomeostatic regulator in insulin sensitivity. Acute IL-10 infusion \nwas shown to improve insulin sensitivity in whole animals (35), \nsuggesting that this molecule may balance the effects of proin-\nflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1. In humans, circulating IL-10 \u2002\nlevels correlate with markers of improved insulin sensitivity (36), \nand IL-10 levels increase along with insulin sensitivity after exer-\ncise (37). Polymorphisms in the IL-10 promoter associated with low \nIL-10 expression are correlated with increased obesity and insulin \nresistance (38). Additionally, adiponectin has been shown to induce \u2002\nIL-10 expression in human leukocytes (39). Studies have also shown \nthat in obese humans and rodents, both adipocyte and SVF com-\npartments from adipose tissue are significant sources of IL-10 (40). \nAs levels of proinflammatory cytokines are increased in obesity, \nthis observation is consistent with the hypothesis that a balance \nexists between proinflammatory and antiinflamma-\ntory factors that governs adipocyte function.\nIn vitro studies described here show that IL-10 \nprotects against TNF-\u03b1\u2013dependent insulin resis-\ntance in adipocytes. The mechanism underlying \nthis effect remains uncertain. In macrophages, \u2002\nIL-10 attenuates TNF-\u03b1 inflammatory signals via \nactivation of STAT3 (24) and modulation of inflam-\nmatory gene transcription rates (29). We have not \nobserved changes in TNF-\u03b1\u2013stimulated NF-\u03baB acti-\nvation with IL-10 in adipocytes, although we did \nobserve increased PI3K signaling with the cytokine. \nThis observation agrees with previous reports that \nIL-10 can activate PI3K pathways via IRS (25) and \nsuggests a possible mechanism by which IL-10 can \nantagonize the deleterious effects of TNF-\u03b1 on \ninsulin signaling in adipocytes.\nObesity leads to a shift in ATM phenotype exem-\nplified by increased Tnfa and Nos2 expression, \nboth characteristically activated in classically acti-\nvated M1 macrophages (4\u20136). We have identified a \nunique subset of ATMs present only in obese animals that express \nF4/80+CD11b+CD11c+. These cells overexpress inflammatory \ngenes compared with F4/80+CD11b+CD11c\u2013 ATMs and are the \nmajor ATM population that accumulates in fat with diet-induced \nobesity. These studies indicate a previously uncharacterized diver-\nsity within the ATM population in obese mice that may have \nimportant functional consequences.\nCD11c is a marker for DCs, which primarily function in \nphagocytosis, immune surveillance, and antigen presentation. \nF4/80+CD11c+ DCs have been termed interstitial dendritic cells; \nthey were recently described in a kidney network that is believed \nto participate in immune surveillance (41). How these DCs par-\nticipate in inflammatory signals in adipose tissue is unknown. \nIt is possible that DC activation is critical to the coordination of \ninflammatory events within fat tissue. An important role for DCs \nin obese adipose tissue is supported by the decreased expression of \nMHC class II genes in CCR2KO mice relative to controls (10).

These data suggest that DC-coordinated immunity may be \ncrucial to the inflammatory events in adipose tissue that occur \nwith obesity. Why such DCs are activated and what antigens they \nrespond to is currently unknown.\nExamining ATM infiltration into adipose tissue in the context \nof monocyte and macrophage heterogeneity leads us to propose \na model for ATM biology that incorporates the diversity of these \ncells (Figure 8). In lean animals, resident macrophages are polar-\nized toward an M2 state (high IL-10 and arginase levels) derived \nfrom CCR2\u2013 monocytes that help maintain normal adipocyte \nfunction, perhaps by promoting tissue repair and angiogenesis in \nadipose tissue. Nutrient excess leads to adipocyte expansion, with \nincreased secretion of monocyte chemoattractants that recruit \ninflammatory type CCR2+ monocytes to fat, where they differen-\ntiate into M1-polarized activated macrophages and CD11c+ DCs. \nAlternatively activated M2 macrophages may be able to partially \nprevent the activation and accumulation of these classically acti-\nvated M1 macrophages (43, 44), and the secretion of IL-10 helps \nprotect adipocytes against the deleterious effects of TNF-\u03b1 and \nrelated cytokines. However, with increasing adiposity, increased \nproinflammatory signals, continued recruitment of M1-polarized \nCCR2+ monocytes, and accumulation of CD11c+ ATMs all con-\ntribute to overwhelm the protective effects of M2 macrophages, \nleading to a dominant role for M1-polarized, classically activated \nmacrophages that generate high TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and NO production. \nThis model explains observations in obese CCR2KO and Mcp1/\nCcl2-KO mice that retain a population of ATMs with decreased \ninflammatory capacity (9, 10). We suspect that these KOs are \ndeficient in the recruitment of CCR2+ monocytes during inflam-\nmation in fat tissue, while the trafficking of CCR2\u2013 monocytes \nwith M2 polarization remains intact. Studies aimed at determin-\ning whether enhancing M2 polarization in ATMs can block diet-\ninduced insulin resistance will be required in order to test this \nmodel. One limitation of the data leading to this model is that \nthey are largely based on flow cytometric analysis of isolated SVF \npopulations after collagenase digestion. This method of separa-\ntion is an efficient one but may not fully capture all stromal cells \nfrom adipose tissue (5).\nHow diet-induced obesity leads to a change from M2 to M1 \npolarization is currently unknown, but the mechanism is likely \nmultifactorial. Our data suggest that the MCP-1/CCR2 axis con-\ntributes to this polarization. We propose 2 potential models for \nthis qualitative change in ATM activation: (a) Obesity may lead \nto an increase in the level of Ly-6ChiCCR2+ circulating monocytes \nthat are primed for activation along an M1 polarization pattern. \nFactors such as MCP-1, TNF-\u03b1, and free fatty acids that activate \nTLR4 (45) may combine to influence this activation pattern as \nthese monocytes enter adipose tissue. This model is supported \nby observations that obesity is associated with changes in acti-\nvation state of circulating monocytes toward a more proinflam-\nmatory phenotype (46, 47). (b) Alternatively, obesity may change \nATMs in adipose tissue from an M2 toward an M1 phenotype. \nMacrophages are reported to have the potential to switch from \none polarization state to another depending upon environmental \nstimuli (48). However, this model depends upon a slow turnover \nof ATMs. Studies involving pulse labeling macrophages in vivo \nindicated that ATMs are largely replaced by 8 weeks in HFD-fed \nmice (42). Additionally, we have observed that the ATMs recruit-\ned to adipose tissue in HFD-fed mice overexpress Ccr2 and other \nproinflammatory mediators. These observations are consistent \nwith the first hypothesis, according to which obesity leads to the \nrecruitment of M1-polarized macrophages that gradually replace \nM2-polarized cells, which represents the default pathway of acti-\nvation under lean conditions.\nOur study frames ATM biology within the context of other \nknown models of inflammation and macrophage recruitment. It \nmay be possible to decrease inflammatory signals in adipose tis-\nsue by modifying ATMs to retain an M2 polarization or by con-\nverting M1 polarized macrophages to M2. Increasing IL-10 levels \nmay represent one mechanism through which this could occur, \nsince chronic IL-10 secretion can suppress classically activated M1 \nmacrophages (49). Future investigations will focus on identifying \nFigure 7\nIL-10 prevents the effects of TNF-\u03b1 on blocking insulin-\nstimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes.

Male C57BL/6 mice were rendered insulin resis-\ntant by feeding an HFD consisting of 45% of calories from fat (D12451; \nResearch Diets Inc.) starting at 8 weeks of age for 20 weeks or indicated \ntimes. Control mice were fed a standard diet consisting of 4.5% fat (5002; \nLabDiet). ob/obJ mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. \nCCR2KO mice on a C57BL/6 background were kindly provided by S. Kun-\nkel (University of Michigan). Animals were housed in a specific pathogen\u2013\nfree facility with a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle and given free access \nto food and water. All animal use was in compliance with the Institute of \nLaboratory Animal Research Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory \nAnimals and approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of \nAnimals at the University of Michigan.\nCell culture. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were propagated and differentiated into \nadipocytes as described previously (50). Adipocytes were used in experi-\nments 8\u201310 days after differentiation. Adherent SVF cells were cultured on \nplastic or glass coverslips in DMEM supplemented with 10% endotoxin-\nfree FBS. For signaling experiments, the cells were starved overnight in \n0.5% serum media prior to stimulation with IL-10. For chronic treatment \nwith IL-10 (20 ng/ml) and TNF-\u03b1 (3 ng/mL), adipocyte media was replaced \nwith fresh media every 24 hours.\nSVF isolation and ATM purification. Epididymal fat pads from male \nC57BL/6 mice fed an ND or HFD were excised and minced in PBS with \ncalcium chloride and 0.5% BSA. Tissue suspensions were centrifuged \nat 500 g for 5 minutes to remove erythrocytes and free leukocytes. Col-\nlagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to 1 mg/ml and incubated at 37\u00b0C \nfor 20 minutes with shaking. The cell suspension was filtered through a \u2002\n100-\u03bcm filter and then spun at 300 g for 5 minutes to separate floating \nadipocytes from the SVF pellet. To ensure proper isolation, adipocyte frac-\ntions were examined by microscopy before and after plating on plastic to \ndetect adherent cells. Samples were digested until adipocyte fractions were \nfree of adherent cells by these 2 quality-control methods to ensure recovery \nof the majority of the SVF population.\nFor cell culture, the pellet containing the SVF cells was resuspended in \ngrowth media for further experiments. For flow cytometry, the SVF pellet \nwas resuspended in 0.5 ml RBC Lysis Buffer (eBioscience) and incubated \nfor 5 minutes prior to resuspension in sorting buffer (PBS with 0.5% endo-\ntoxin-free FBS, 2 mM EDTA, and 25 mM HEPES) at a concentration of \n107 cells/ml. Cells were incubated with Fc Block (BD Biosciences) prior to \nstaining with conjugated antibodies for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C followed by 2 \nwashes in 10\u00d7 excess of sorting buffer. Cells were resuspended in sorting \nbuffer supplemented with DAPI and then analyzed by FACS (FACSAria; BD \nBiosciences). Viable cells were sorted directly into RNA lysis buffer for RNA \nextraction. ATMs were identified by coexpression of F4/80 and CD11b.\nIsolation of CD11b+ cells from SVF isolates was performed by magnetic \nimmunoaffinity isolation with anti-CD11b antibodies conjugated to \nmagnetic beads (MACS; Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were isolated using positive \nselection columns prior to preparation of whole-cell lysates.\nImmunofluorescence staining. For immunofluorescence, SVF cells were plat-\ned onto glass coverslips for 2 hours, and nonadherent cells were removed by \n3 washes with PBS.

In lean, insulin-sensitive states, ATMs are polar-\nized toward an M2 state with IL-10 and arginase expression. Early during HFD treatment, adipocytes undergo hypertrophy, releasing chemokines \nthat induce recruitment of M1-polarized ATMs with low IL-10 expression and increased iNOS and TNF-\u03b1 production. In these early stages of mild \nobesity with retained insulin sensitivity, M2-polarized resident ATMs are able to partially protect adipocytes from these inflammatory factors and \nmay block M1 polarization. With increased adiposity, recruited CCR2+ ATMs form crownlike structures (CLS) and overwhelm the protective effects \nof M2 macrophages, leading to a dominant role for TNF-\u03b1 and iNOS. These factors generate insulin resistance in adipocytes, activate JNK and \nNF-\u03baB, alter adipokine secretion, and lead to excess circulating levels of free fatty acids due to adipocyte lipolysis and impaired lipogenesis.\nresearch article\n \nThe Journal of Clinical Investigation\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 http://www.jci.org\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Volume 117\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Number 1\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 January 2007\t\n183\n10% formalin for 20 minutes at room temperature.

More-\nover, these cells fulfill homeostatic functions beyond defense, \nincluding tissue remodeling in ontogenesis and orchestration of \nmetabolic functions (1\u20133).\nCells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage are characterized by \nconsiderable diversity and plasticity. In tissues, mononuclear phago-\ncytes respond to environmental cues (e.g., microbial products, dam-\naged cells, activated lymphocytes) with the acquisition of distinct \nfunctional phenotypes. In response to various signals, macrophages \nmay undergo classical M1 activation (stimulated by TLR ligands and \nIFN-\u03b3) or alternative M2 activation (stimulated by IL-4/IL-13); these \nstates mirror the Th1\u2013Th2 polarization of T cells (2, 4).\nThe M1 phenotype is characterized by the expression of high \nlevels of proinflammatory cytokines, high production of reactive \nnitrogen and oxygen intermediates, promotion of Th1 response, \nand strong microbicidal and tumoricidal activity. In contrast, M2 \nmacrophages are considered to be involved in parasite containment \nand promotion of tissue remodeling and tumor progression and to \nhave immunoregulatory functions. They are characterized by effi-\ncient phagocytic activity, high expression of scavenging molecules, \nthe expression of mannose and galactose receptors, production of \nornithine and polyamines through the arginase pathway, and an \nIL-12loIL-10hiIL-1decoyRhiIL-1RAhi phenotype (1, 4). M1-M2 mac-\nrophages also are distinct in their chemokine expression profiles.\nSignals including IL-10, glucocorticoid hormones, molecules \nreleased from apoptotic cells, and immune complexes also pro-\nfoundly affect monocyte-macrophage function. These signals induce \nexpression of functional phenotypes that share selected properties \nwith M2 cells (e.g., high mannose and scavenger receptor expression), \nbut are distinct from them, for instance, in terms of the chemokine \nrepertoire. Operationally, we refer to these cells as M2 like (5).\nPlasticity and flexibility are key features of mononuclear \nphagocytes and of their activation states (2, 4, 6). The pheno-\ntype of polarized M1-M2 macrophages can, to some extent, be \nreversed in vitro and in vivo (7, 8). Moreover, pathology is fre-\nquently associated with dynamic changes in macrophage activa-\ntion, with classically activated M1 cells implicated in initiating \nand sustaining inflammation and M2 or M2-like cells associ-\nated with resolution or smoldering chronic inflammation (9). \nIt remains unclear whether the mechanism of these switches \ninvolves the recruitment of circulating precursors or the reeduca-\ntion of cells in situ. However, it is now apparent that specialized \nor polarized T cells (Th1, Th2, Tregs) that are key orchestrators \nof macrophage polarized activation (2) also exhibit previously \nunsuspected flexibility and plasticity (10).\nHere, we will focus on recent progress in understanding the \nmolecular basis underlying macrophage polarization, including \nsignaling pathways, transcription factors, and epigenetic regula-\ntion. Moreover, the dynamics and limitations in our understand-\ning of polarized macrophage activation in vivo will be discussed, \nfocusing on selected pathological conditions (for references to \npathology not discussed here, see Supplemental References; sup-\nplemental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/\nJCI59643DS1). Previous reviews also provide a framework for \nthis work (1\u20133, 6, 11).\nMolecular determinants of macrophage polarization\nA network of signaling molecules, transcription factors, epigenetic \nmechanisms, and posttranscriptional regulators underlies the dif-\nferent forms of macrophage activation. Canonical IRF/STAT sig-\nnaling pathways are activated by IFNs and TLR signaling to skew \nmacrophage function toward the M1 phenotype (via STAT1) or by \nIL-4 and IL-13 to skew toward the M2 phenotype (via STAT6) (3). \nM1 macrophages upregulate IRF5, which is essential for induction \nof cytokines (IL-12, IL-23, TNF) involved in eliciting Th1 and Th17 \nresponses (12). The IL-4 type I and type II receptors (1, 13) acti-\nvate Stat6, which in turn activates transcription of genes typical \nof M2 polarization, e.g., mannose receptor (Mrc1), resistin-like \u03b1 \u2002\nMacrophage plasticity and polarization:  \nin vivo veritas\nAntonio Sica1,2 and Alberto Mantovani1,3\n1Istituto Clinico Humanitas IRCCS, Rozzano, Italy. 2DiSCAFF, University of Piemonte Orientale A. Avogadro, Novara, Italy.  \n3Department of Translational Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.\nDiversity and plasticity are hallmarks of cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. In response to \nIFNs, Toll-like receptor engagement, or IL-4/IL-13 signaling, macrophages undergo M1 (classical) \nor M2 (alternative) activation, which represent extremes of a continuum in a universe of activation \nstates. Progress has now been made in defining the signaling pathways, transcriptional networks, \nand epigenetic mechanisms underlying M1-M2 or M2-like polarized activation. Functional skew-\ning of mononuclear phagocytes occurs in vivo under physiological conditions (e.g., ontogenesis \nand pregnancy) and in pathology (allergic and chronic inflammation, tissue repair, infection, and \ncancer). However, in selected preclinical and clinical conditions, coexistence of cells in different activation states \nand unique or mixed phenotypes have been observed, a reflection of dynamic changes and complex tissue-derived \nsignals. The identification of mechanisms and molecules associated with macrophage plasticity and polarized acti-\nvation provides a basis for macrophage-centered diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.\nConflict of interest: Antonio Sica has received grant support from Johnson & \nJohnson.\nCitation for this article: J Clin Invest. 2012;122(3):787\u2013795. doi:10.1172/JCI59643.\nscience in medicine\n788 \nThe Journal of Clinical Investigation\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 http://www.jci.org\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Volume 122\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Number 3\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 March 2012\n(Retnla, Fizz1), and chitinase 3\u2013like 3 (Chi3l3, Ym1) (14). IL-10 acti-\nvates STAT3-mediated expression of genes (Il10, Tgfb1, Mrc1) asso-\nciated with an M2-like phenotype (4, 15, 16).\nSTAT-mediated activation of macrophages is regulated by mem-\nbers of the SOCS family. IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3, the latter in concert with \nTLR stimulation, upregulate SOCS1 and SOCS3, which in turn \ninhibit the action of STAT1 and STAT3, respectively (17, 18).\nDownstream of, or in parallel with, the IRF/STAT/SOCS pathway, \na panel of transcription factors orchestrates polarized macrophage \nactivation. The nuclear receptors PPAR\u03b3 (19) and PPAR\u03b4 (20, 21) con-\ntrol distinct subsets of genes associated with M2 macrophage activa-\ntion and oxidative metabolism (Figure 1). Interestingly, STAT6 coor-\ndinates and synergizes with both PPAR\u03b3 (22) and Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 \u2002\n(KLF4), a member of a family of proteins that contribute to macro-\nphage function (23, 24). KLF4 cooperates with Stat6 to induce M2 \ngenes (Arg-1, Mrc1, Fizz1, PPAR\u03b3) and inhibit M1 genes (TNFa, Cox-2, \u2002\nCCL5, iNOS) via sequestration of coactivators required for NF-\u03baB acti-\nvation. KLF2 regulates macrophage activation by inhibiting NF-\u03baB/\u2002\nHIF-1\u03b1 activities (25). IL-4 also induces c-Myc activity in human \nmacrophages (26), which controls genes of M2 activation (Scarb1, \nAlox15, and Mrc1) as well as STAT6 and PPAR\u03b3 activation (26).\nTLR engagement leads to NF-\u03baB activation and production of \ninflammatory mediators (27) associated with M1 macrophages. \nHowever, NF-\u03baB activation also activates a genetic program essen-\ntial for resolution of inflammation (28) and for M2 polarization of \ntumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) (29). Moreover, induction of \np50 NF-\u03baB homodimers is essential for M2 polarization in vitro and \nin vivo (30). The hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 are \nexpressed differentially in M1- and M2-polarized macrophages (31) \nand regulate inducible NOS2 (M1) and arginase 1 (M2), respectively.\nFigure 1\nMechanisms of macrophage polarization. The major pathways of macrophage polarization are outlined. The crosstalk between the M1-M2 macro-\nphage\u2013polarizing pathways is also indicated. The balance between activation of STAT1 and STAT3/STAT6 finely regulates macrophage polariza-\ntion and activity. A predominance of NF-\u03baB and STAT1 activation promotes M1 macrophage polarization, resulting in cytotoxic and inflammatory \nfunctions. In contrast, a predominance of STAT3 and STAT6 activation results in M2 macrophage polarization, associated with immune suppres-\nsion and tumor progression. PPAR\u03b3 and PPAR\u03b4 control distinct aspects of M2 macrophage activation and oxidative metabolism. KLF4 and KLF2 \nparticipate in the promotion of M2 macrophage functions by cooperating with STAT6 and suppressing the NF-\u03baB/HIF-1\u03b1\u2013dependent transcription, \nrespectively. IL-4\u2013induced c-Myc activity controls a subset of M2-associated genes. IL-4 also induces the M2-polarizing Jmjd3-IRF4 axis to inhibit \nIRF5-mediated M1 polarization. IL-10 promotes M2 polarization through the induction of p50 NF-\u03baB homodimer, c-Maf, and STAT3 activities.\nscience in medicine\n \nThe Journal of Clinical Investigation\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 http://www.jci.org\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Volume 122\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Number 3\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 March 2012\t\n789\nEpigenetic changes and noncoding RNAs also participate \nin directing macrophage polarization (32\u201334). IL-4 induces \nupregulation of the histone demethylase JMJD3 in mouse macro-\nphages, which alters chromatin modifications to promote expres-\nsion of M2 genes and inhibit M1 genes. miR-155 was recently iden-\ntified as targeting the IL-13R\u03b11 subunit, thus decreasing a set of \nM2 genes in human macrophages (35).\nPathology\nResolution of inflammation and repair. Remodeling and repair occur \ndynamically during ontogenesis and inflammation, and these pro-\ncesses are orchestrated by macrophages.\nMacrophages undergo dynamic changes during different phases \nof wound healing. M1-polarized macrophages mediate tissue dam-\nage and initiate inflammatory responses (1, 2). During the early \nstages of the repair response after wounding the skin, infiltrating \nmacrophages have an M2 phenotype and their depletion inhibits \nthe formation of a highly vascularized, cellular granulation tissue \nand of scar tissues (36). Under these conditions, the removal of \napoptotic cells (efferocytosis) (37, 38) and the presence of TGF-\u03b2 \u2002\n(39) may skew macrophage function, though demonstration of \nactual in vivo relevance of these findings is lacking.\nIn a peritoneal model of inflammation, resolution phase macro-\nphages expressed a unique mixed M1-M2 phenotype, and cAMP \nwas essential to restrain M1 activation (40). In humans, chronic \nvenous ulcers (CVU) represent a failure to resolve a chronic inflam-\nmatory condition (41). Correlative analysis in patients and a \nmouse model suggested that in CVU the infiltrating macrophages \nfail to switch from an M1 to an M2 phenotype (41). Notably, iron \nmetabolism is differentially regulated in polarized macrophages \n(42). In CVU, the iron overload in macrophages sustained their M1 \nactivation, leading to ROS-mediated DNA damage, fibroblast cel-\nlular senescence, and defective tissue repair (41). It is tempting to \nspeculate that similar mechanisms may underlie M2 functions in \npatients with severe burns, where hemorrhage and tissue damage, \nalong with the high release of iron by M2 macrophages (42), may \nresult in high iron tissue levels (43).\nDynamic changes in the phenotype of recruited mononuclear \nphagocytes have been observed in models of ischemic heart disease \n(44), suggesting that this is a general feature of the natural history of \nrepair processes. In a murine model of hind limb ischemia, haplode-\nficiency of the oxygen sensor prolyl-hydroxylase PHD2 induced the \ncanonical NF-\u03baB pathway in macrophages, which promoted their \nM2 polarization and proarteriogenic phenotype (45). This obser-\nvation may suggest a functional link between oxygen deprivation, \nas occurring in wounds and tumors, and progressive induction of \nproarteriogenic M2 macrophages. Thus, although the macrophage \nphenotype in resolution need not be a phenocopy of in vitro\u2013gener-\nated M2 cells, preclinical and clinical evidence support the long-held \nview of a key role of polarized macrophages in tissue repair.\nIn a model of retinal neuropathy, mononuclear phagocyte infil-\ntration generates a neuroprotective microenvironment promot-\ning retinal progenitor cell survival (46). The interplay of polarized \nmacrophages with stem and progenitor cells is likely a key com-\nponent of their role in repair and remodeling, although the actual \ntissue-protective significance of polarized macrophages in degen-\nerative diseases and their involvement with stem and progenitor \ncells remain to be determined (see Supplemental References).\nMacrophage activation has been found in autoimmune and \ninflammatory diseases and in particular in lupus nephritis \n(47). In a murine model of SLE, proinflammatory activation \nof macrophages was sustained by Notch signaling (48). Con-\nversely, the acute phase protein serum amyloid P (SAP) skewed \nmacrophages toward an antiinflammatory M2-like phenotype, \nthus alleviating lupus nephritis (49). In RA, a major source of \nM1 cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-12p70) (50) in the joints are \nthe synovial macrophages, whose number correlate with the \ninflammatory disease activity (51). On this basis, PPAR\u03b4 and \nPPAR\u03b3 are considered potential disease-modifying drugs for RA \n(52, 53). In a murine model of experimental colitis, recruitment \nof CCL11-expressing Ly6ChiCCR2+ inflammatory monocytes \ninto the colon correlates with eosinophil infiltration and his-\ntopathology (54).\nInfection\nBacteria. M1 macrophages are generally considered responsible for \nresistance against intracellular pathogens and characterize infec-\ntion with Listeria monocytogenes (55), Salmonella typhi, and Salmo-\nnella typhimurium (56), as well as the early phases of infection with \nMycobacterium tuberculosis (57), Mycobacterium ulcerans, and Myco-\nbacterium avium (58, 59). Uncontrolled M1 inflammation associ-\nated with acute infections with E. coli or Streptococcus sp. causes \ngastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, neonatal meningitis, and \nsepsis (60). The M1-M2 switch observed during the transition \nfrom acute to chronic infection may provide protection against \noverwhelming uncontrolled inflammation; however, a phenotype \nswitch can also favor pathogens that have evolved strategies to \ninterfere with M1-associated killing (58, 61\u201364).\nChronic inflammation and granuloma formation are char-\nacterized by the presence of macrophages with an epithelial \nmorphology and by macrophage homotypic fusion with the \nformation of multinucleated giant cells (MNG) (65). IL-4\u2013medi-\nated upregulation of E-cadherin, which engages in intercellular \nhomotypic adhesion, is likely to underlie MNG formation. STAT6 \ndrives expression of E-cadherin and DC transmembrane protein \n(DC-STAMP; ref. 66) during MNG generation. The actual func-\ntion and role of MNG remain elusive.\nParasites. In experimental and human parasite infections, macro-\nphages generally undergo a dynamic switch toward M2 polariza-\ntion (61, 67). The early and late phases of Taenia crassiceps infection \nare characterized by Th1-driven M1 and Th2-driven IL-4\u2013mediat-\ned M2 polarization of macrophages, respectively (11, 68). A simi-\nlar M1-M2 switch has been reported during Schistosoma mansoni \nand Trypanosoma congolense infection (69). In the chronic stage of \nT. crassiceps infection, the p50 NF-\u03baB subunit (see above) promotes \nprotective M2 macrophage polarization associated with decreased \nparasite burden (30).\nThe recurrent association of M2 polarization with parasite infec-\ntions does not necessarily imply a generalized relevance in patho-\ngenesis. For instance, lineage-selective ablation of the IL-4\u03b1 chain \ncauses a dramatic increase in susceptibility to S. mansoni, but has \nno discernible effect on Nippostrongylus infection (70).\nViral infections. Polarized activation of macrophages has been \nassociated with virus infection (e.g., HIV, Kaposi sarcoma\u2013associ-\nated herpes virus, and others; see Supplemental References), and \nthis polarization may be important in containing and limiting \ntissue damage. In particular, during severe respiratory syncytial \nvirus\u2013induced (RSV-induced) bronchiolitis, IL-4R\u03b1/STAT6-\ndependent M2 macrophage differentiation reduces inflammation \nand epithelial damage in lungs (71).\nscience in medicine\n790 \nThe Journal of Clinical Investigation\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 http://www.jci.org\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Volume 122\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Number 3\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 March 2012\nAllergy\nAllergy is driven by Th2 cells and products and is associated with \nM2 polarization of macrophages (72, 73). IL-4\u2013inducible che-\nmokines acting on CCR4 (e.g., CCL22) have also been reported \nto promote skewing of macrophage function (74). Evidence now \nindicates that chitin- and arginase-dependent M2 pathways play \nan active role in pathogenesis (75, 76). Asthma is associated with \ntissue remodeling, including collagen deposition and goblet cell \nhyperplasia. IL-4\u2013driven M2 polarization is likely to play a key role \nas an orchestrator of these processes (77).\nAllergy represents a paradigm for IL-4/IL-13\u2013driven type 2 \ninflammation. However, there is evidence that the inflamma-\nsome/IL-1/Th17 pathway can also drive allergic inflammation \n(78, 79). Moreover, a Th1-associated cytokine, IL-18, has also \nbeen implicated in allergic inflammation (80). It is therefore per-\nhaps not surprising that mixed phenotype macrophages have \nbeen observed (81).\nCancer\nCancer-related inflammation is characterized by the recruitment \nof cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage to tumor tissues \n(2, 82, 83), which also condition the premetastatic niche, to \nfavor secondary localization of cancer. Classically activated M1-\npolarized macrophages have the potential to exhibit antitumor \nactivity and to elicit tumor tissue disruption (4). At least in some \nmodels of carcinogenesis in the mouse, progression is associated \nwith a phenotype switch from M1 to M2 (84). Th1-driven mac-\nrophage activation was found to mediate elimination of senes-\ncent hepatocytes, which drive subsequent carcinogenesis (85). \nIt is therefore likely that classically activated M1 macrophages \ncontribute to the T cell\u2013mediated elimination and equilibrium \nphases during tumor progression (86).\nAt later stages of progression in mice and humans, TAMs gener-\nally have an M2-like phenotype with low IL-12 expression, high IL-10 \u2002\nexpression, and low tumoricidal activity and promotion of tissue \nremodeling and angiogenesis. TAM infiltration is generally associ-\nated with poor prognosis, as shown in Hodgkin disease, glioma, chol-\nangiocarcinoma, and breast carcinoma (87, 88). However, TAMs with \nvarious functional states can coexist in the same tumor (2, 89). Vari-\nous pathways orchestrate the protumor function of myelomonocytic \ncells, including tumor-derived and host-derived signals (2). Lympho-\ncytes are key orchestrators of TAM function (2), but pathways differ \nin tumors originating in different organs. For instance, skewing of \nmacrophage function was found to be mediated by IL-4\u2013producing \nTh2 cells in skin (90, 91) and by antibody-producing B cells in breast \ncarcinogenesis (92, 93). B1 cells can promote cancer progression in \nthe skin (5), and fibroblasts can also contribute to circuits driving \nmacrophage polarization and tumor promotion (94).\nTumor cell products, including extracellular matrix compo-\nnents, IL-10, CSF-1, and chemokines (CCL2, CCL18, CCL17, and \nCXCL4), set macrophages in an M2-like, cancer-promoting mode \n(82, 95\u201397). TAMs can also interact with and promote the tumori-\ngenicity of cancer stem cells (CSCs) via production of the milk-fat \nglobule-epidermal growth factor\u2013VIII (MFG-E8) by activation of \nthe STAT3 and sonic hedgehog pathways (98).\nThe identification of the various cellular and molecular path-\nways that participate in inflammation in different human cancers \nwill be required to translate our understanding of cancer-related \ninflammation to meaningful therapeutic advances.\nObesity and metabolism\nObesity-associated insulin resistance, diabetes, and metabolic \nsyndrome are sustained by chronic subclinical inflammation \n(99). Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are a major component \nTable 1\nPrototypic therapeutic strategies targeting macrophage polarization\nFunction \nTherapeutic agent \nDisease\nRecruitment\t\nAnti\u2013CSF-1 (Ab and antisense-ODN)\t\nBreast cancer\n\t\nAnti-CCL2 (Ab)\t\nBreast, prostate cancer\n\t\nCCL2 inhibitor (bindarit)\t\nMelanoma and vascular pathology\n\t\nfms-tyrosine kinase inhibitors\t\nAcute myeloid leukemia and bone metastasis\nDepletion\t\nTrabectedin\t\nLiposarcoma\nSwitch to M1\t\nIFN-\u03b3\t\nAtopic dermatitis; ovarian cancer\n\t\nTLR9 agonist (CpG-ODN)\t\nAsthma\n\t\nCpG-ODN + anti\u2013IL-10\t\nBreast cancer\n\t\nAnti-CD40 (agonist)\t\nPancreatic cancer\n\t\nSTAT3 inhibitors\t\nBreast cancer; melanoma\n\t\nSTAT6 inhibitors\t\nBreast cancer; T. crassiceps (e.s.)\n\t\np50 NF-\u03baB inhibitors\t\nT. congolense; fibrosarcoma, melanoma\n\t\nIKK\u03b2 inhibitors\t\nOvarian cancer\n\t\nImidazoquinolines (TLR7/8 agonists)\t\nSCC, cutaneous B cell lymphomas\n\t\nZoledronic acid\t\nBreast cancer\nInhibition of M1 pathways\t\nCD40 (antagonist)\t\nAtherosclerosis\nInhibition of M2 pathways\t\nIL-33 (antagonist)\t\nAirway inflammation\nInduction of M2 pathways\t\nPPAR\u03b3 agonists (thiazolidinediones)\t\nDiabetes; atherosclerosis\n\t\nNonthiazolidinedione tyrosine-based\t\n\t\nPPAR\u03b3 ligand (GW7845)\t\nAtherosclerosis\n\t\nStatin\t\nGlomerulonephritis\nODN, oligodeoxyribonucleotides; IKK\u03b2, IKK\u03b2 subunit of I\u03baB kinase (IKK); e.s., early stage of infection.

In obese subjects and mice, adipocytes release media-\ntors such as CCL2, TNF, or free fatty acids, which promote the \nrecruitment and activation of ATMs (100\u2013102). In turn, ATM-pro-\nduced inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2) counteract \nthe insulin-sensitizing action of adiponectin and leptin, leading to \ninsulin resistance. ATM infiltration correlates with the degree of \nobesity (101\u2013103). ATM accumulation is orchestrated by selected \nchemokines and their receptors (e.g., CCL2/CCR2 or CCL5/CCR5) \n(101, 103, 104) and by the macrophage-derived apoptosis inhibitor \nof macrophages (AIM) (105).\nATMs from obese mice and humans are polarized toward an \nM1 phenotype, with upregulation of TNF and iNOS. In con-\ntrast \u201clean\u201d ATMs express high levels of M2 genes, including \nIL-10, Ym1, and Arginase 1 (106, 107). Weight loss is associ-\nated with a shift back to an M2-like phenotype. However, evi-\ndence indicates that the ATM population in obese patients is \ndiverse, with a minor F4/80+CD11b+CD11c\u2013, IL-10hi, M2-like \npopulation coexisting with M1 cells (106). Moreover, analysis \nof CD11c+ ATMs from obese mice revealed a mixed profile of \nseveral M1-M2 gene transcripts (108). Weight loss is associ-\nated with an increase in F4/80+CD11c\u2013CD301+ M2-like macro-\nphages, which promote lipolysis (109).\nProgress has been made in defining the molecular pathways that \naccount for polarization of ATMs (19, 20, 24, 110, 111) in obesity. \nMice with macrophage-selective genetic inactivation of PPAR\u03b3, \nPPAR\u03b4, and KLF4 show inhibition of obesity-induced insulin \nresistance (19, 20, 24, 106, 110), although these results may be \nstrain specific (112). The adipose tissue of obese subjects shows a \nmarked reduction in KLF4 levels. Nguyen et al. have recently dem-\nonstrated that adaptation to lower temperatures (thermogenesis) \nis associated with polarization of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and \nwhite adipose tissue (WAT) macrophages to the alternative state \n(M2), with increased expression of thermogenic genes (Ppargc1 \nand Ucp1) (113). In response to cold, IL-4\u2013driven M2 macrophages \nrelease noradrenaline in BAT and WAT, which coordinates fatty \nacid mobilization and energy expenditure (113). Although further \nwork is needed to dissect the diversity and dynamics of ATMs, \u2002\nM2-like cells in nonobese individuals are likely involved in main-\ntaining adipose tissue homeostasis, preventing inflammation, and \npromoting insulin sensitivity. In contrast, M1-like ATMs drive \nobesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance (107). The \nrole of macrophages in obesity and associated disorders underlines \na homeostatic function of macrophages in metabolism as cells \ncapable of reorienting their own metabolic activity and as orches-\ntrators of general metabolism.\nFigure 2\nSchematic representation of macrophage plasticity and polarization in pathology. Dynamic changes occur over time with evolution of pathology: \nfor instance, a switch from M1 to M2 macrophage polarization characterizes the transition from early to chronic phases of infection. Moreover, \nmixed phenotypes or populations with different phenotypes can coexist. For pathologies not discussed in the text, see Supplemental References. \nImages adapted from refs. 141\u2013144.\nscience in medicine\n792 \nThe Journal of Clinical Investigation\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 http://www.jci.org\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Volume 122\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Number 3\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 March 2012\nTherapeutic targets in polarized inflammation\nSpecific macrophage-targeted therapies are now taking the first \nsteps into the clinical arena (Table 1). In addition, therapeutic \napproaches not originally designed as macrophage oriented or spe-\ncific have been found to affect macrophage activation and polar-\nization. These off-target examples provide insights and lessons for \nthe development of more specifically directed approaches.\nRecruitment is a key determinant sustaining macrophage \nnumbers at sites of inflammation and immunity. Monocyte \nattractants include members of the chemokine superfamily, \nCCL2/MCP-1 in particular, and growth factors interacting with \ntyrosine kinase receptors CSF-1 and VEGF (83, 114, 115). CSF-1 \nreceptor (c-fms) kinase inhibitors have been generated, and these \nmolecules exhibit antiangiogenic and antimetastatic activity in \nacute myeloid leukemia and melanoma models (116, 117). Che-\nmokines and CSF-1 are more than monocyte attractants; they \nalso promote M2-like skewing of macrophage function (97, \n118, 119). Antibodies directed against CCL2/CCR2 have proven \nactive in prostate and breast cancer (83, 120). A CCL2 inhibitor \n(bindarit) has proven active in preclinical models of cancer and \nvascular pathology, resulting in inhibition of monocyte recruit-\nment (121); this agent is now undergoing evaluation for clinical \nuse. Anti\u2013CSF-1 antibodies and antisense oligonucleotides sup-\npress macrophage infiltration and xenograft mammary tumor \ngrowth in mice (122\u2013124). VEGF inhibitors can decrease macro-\nphage recruitment, and this effect may contribute to their anti-\nangiogenic activity (125). In contrast, in response to neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy, altered composition in the immune microenvi-\nronment was found in breast cancer patients, with increased per-\ncentage of infiltrating myeloid cells (126).\nRecent results suggest that in situ, proliferation is a key deter-\nminant of macrophage accumulation during inflammation in \nthe peritoneum and lungs (127, 128). In the latter, IL-4 was found \nto sustain macrophage proliferation. If proliferation is indeed a \nmajor general mechanism sustaining macrophage accumulation, \nthis may suggest novel approaches to reduce macrophage numbers \nin situ and a different perspective for anti\u2013CSF-1/CSF-1R strate-\ngies. However, determining the actual significance of macrophage \nproliferation in humans, in particular in Th2-mediated inflamma-\ntion, is a major stumbling block in this perspective.\nReorienting and reshaping deranged macrophage polarization \nis the holy grail of macrophage therapeutic targeting (129). Polar-\nized phenotypes are reversible in vitro and in vivo (29, 130\u2013132). \nIn proof of concept and in a large clinical study in ovarian cancer \npatients, IFN-\u03b3 was found to activate TAM tumoricidal activity, \ninducing a phenotype switch with unequivocal evidence of clinical \nresponses (133). In a model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, \nCD40 agonist antibodies promoted a remarkable antitumor effect \nand induced high expression of M1 markers (MHC class II and \nCD86) in macrophages (132).\nModulation of macrophage function is an off-target effect for \na number of diverse therapeutic agents. PPAR\u03b3 agonists (thia-\nzolidinediones) have long been used in the treatment of diabetes. \nThe evidence linking PPAR\u03b3 to M2 polarization and hence to the \nhomeostatic role of ATMs sheds fresh new light on their mode \nof action. Preclinical evidence suggests that PPAR\u03b3 promotes \u2002\nM2-like polarization and homeostatic metabolic function in ATMs \nand that alteration of this function is a key pathogenic feature in \ndiabetes (134\u2013136). Other therapeutic strategies that have been \nreported to affect macrophage polarization include zoledronic \nacid (an agent used for preventing recurrence of breast cancer bone \nmetastasis), statins (137), trabectedin (138) and TLR ligands (e.g., \nimiquimod and CpG) (see also Supplemental References).\nConcluding remarks\nProgress has been made in defining the molecular networks \nunderlying polarized activation of macrophages. Molecular \ndeterminants of M1 versus M2 polarization include members \nof the PPAR, KLF, IRF, STAT, NF-\u03baB, and HIF families. Regu-\nlation of skewing also involves epigenetic modifications with \ninvolvement of histone methylation and acetylation. miRNAs \nhave emerged as regulators of phagocyte activation and function \n(34, 139), but their role in macrophage polarization needs to be \nfurther defined.\nFunctional polarization has now been observed in vivo under \nphysiological and pathological conditions. The former include \nembryogenesis and pregnancy and normal maintenance of select-\ned tissues, such as testis and adipose. The latter include chronic \ninflammation and tissue repair, metabolic and vascular disorders, \ninfection, and cancer. There is now evidence that macrophages are \na key component of all of these processes (Figure 2).\nUnder condition such as parasite infections, allergy, and many \ncancers, the functional phenotypes of macrophages in vivo mirror \nthose of canonical M1-M2 or M2-like polarized states as defined \nin vitro. However, in a number of pathological conditions, such as \nneurodegenerative disorders (140), this is not the case, and macro-\nphage populations express mixed or unique phenotypes. The con-\ntribution of coexisting cells with different phenotypes, the impact \nof dynamic changes during disease evolution, and the molecular \nnetworks orchestrating these mixed phenotypes need to be carefully \ndissected on a case-by-case basis. Indeed, this macrophage plasticity \ncalls for in-depth analysis in different pathological conditions.\nTherapeutic macrophage targeting is in its infancy. Selected \nclinically approved therapeutic strategies, such as use of PPAR\u03b3 \ninhibitors, statins, zolendronic acid, and preventive activities such \nas weight loss may have an impact on the functional status of \nmacrophages; however, the extent to which their effect on mac-\nrophages explains their clinical efficacy remains to be defined. \nThe identification of mechanisms and molecules associated with \nmacrophage plasticity and polarized activation provides a basis for \nmacrophage-centered diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by Associazione Italiana Ricerca sul Can-\ncro (AIRC), Italy; Fondazione Cariplo, Italy; Ministero Universit\u00e0 \nRicerca (MIUR) e Salute; and by the European Commission (ERC \nProject No. 233417 HIIS to AM).\nAddress correspondence to: Antonio Sica, IRCCS Istituto Clinico \nHumanitas, via Manzoni 113, 20089 Rozzano, Milan, Italy.

Synaptic plasticity specifically refers to the\nactivity-dependent modification of the strength or efficacy\nof synaptic transmission at preexisting synapses, and for\nover a century has been proposed to play a central role in\nthe capacity of the brain to incorporate transient experi-\nences into persistent memory traces. Synaptic plasticity is\nalso thought to play key roles in the early development of\nneural circuitry and evidence is accumulating that impair-\nments in synaptic plasticity mechanisms contribute to\nseveral prominent neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, eluci-\ndating the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying\nsynaptic plasticity in any number of different brain regions\nis critical for understanding the neural basis of many\naspects of normal and pathological brain function.\nGiven the diversity of the functions ascribed to synaptic\nplasticity, it is not surprising that many forms and\nmechanisms of synaptic plasticity have been described.\nSynaptic transmission can be either enhanced or depressed\nby activity, and these changes span temporal domains\nranging from milliseconds to hours, days, and presumably\neven longer. Furthermore, virtually all excitatory synapses\nin the mammalian brain simultaneously express a number\nof different forms of synaptic plasticity. Here, we attempt to\nprovide a broad overview of the mechanisms of the most\nprominent\nforms\nof\nplasticity\nobserved\nat\nexcitatory\nsynapses in the mammalian brain. After briefly reviewing\nshort-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity, we will emphasize\ncurrent understanding of the cellular mechanisms and\npossible functions of the class of phenomena commonly\ntermed long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depres-\nsion (LTD).\nSHORT-TERM SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY\nNumerous forms of short-term synaptic plasticity, lasting\non the order of milliseconds to several minutes, have been\nobserved at virtually every synapse examined in organisms\nranging from simple invertebrates to mammals (Zucker and\nRegehr, 2002). These are thought to play important roles in\nshort-term adaptations to sensory inputs, transient changes\nin behavioral states, and short-lasting forms of memory.\nMost forms of short-term synaptic plasticity are triggered\nby short bursts of activity causing a transient accumulation\nof calcium in presynaptic nerve terminals. This increase in\npresynaptic\ncalcium\nin\nturn\ncauses\nchanges\nin\nthe\nprobability of neurotransmitter release by directly modify-\ning the biochemical processes that underlie the exocytosis\nof synaptic vesicles.\nPaired-Pulse Facilitation and Depression\nWhen two stimuli are delivered within a short interval, the\nresponse to the second stimulus can be either enhanced or\nReceived 5 June 2007; revised 1 August 2007; accepted 1 August 2007\n*Correspondence: Dr RC Malenka, Department of Psychiatry, Stanford\nMedical Center, 1201 Welch Rd., Rm.

Paired-pulse\ndepression is commonly observed at all synapses at short\n(less than 20 ms) interstimulus intervals, and most probably\nresults from inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium or\ncalcium channels or from a transient depletion of the\nrelease-ready pool of vesicles docked at the presynaptic\nterminal. Many synapses exhibit paired-pulse facilitation at\nlonger\ninterstimulus\nintervals\n(20\u2013500 ms).\nA\nsimple\nexplanation for this phenomenon is that the residual\ncalcium left over from the invasion of the first action\npotential contributes to additional release during the second\nstimulation, but it is likely that additional mechanisms are\ninvolved. These may involve activation of protein kinases\nthat modulate the activity of presynaptic phosphoproteins.\nFor example, mice in which the presynaptic phosphoprotein\nsynapsin (De Camilli et al, 1990) has been knocked out,\nexhibit abnormal short-term plasticity (Rosahl et al, 1993,\n1995).\nWhether a synapse exhibits paired-pulse facilitation or\ndepression depends on the recent history of activation of\nthe synapse. Because these forms of plasticity largely result\nfrom changes in the probability of transmitter release (p),\nsynapses that begin with a very high p tend to depress their\nresponse to the second pulse (Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997).\nIn contrast, synapses with a low initial p normally exhibit an\nincrease in p in response to the second stimulus. Consistent\nwith this idea, manipulations that decrease p (eg, activation\nof presynaptic autoreceptors) almost always cause an\nincrease in the magnitude of paired-pulse facilitation, or\neven a conversion of paired-pulse depression to facilitation.\nThus, the same synapse can display either facilitation or\ndepression, depending on its recent history of activation\nand modulation.\nFacilitation and Depression Following Trains of\nStimuli\nLonger-lasting forms of plasticity are observed following\nrepetitive or tetanic stimulation of synapses with prolonged\n(approximately 200 ms to 5 s) trains of stimulation applied\nat high frequencies (10\u2013200 Hz) (Zucker and Regehr, 2002).\nAugmentation and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) describe\nan enhancement of transmitter release lasting from seconds\n(augmentation) to several minutes (PTP). They also involve\nan increase in the probability of transmitter release in\nresponse to an action potential due, in large part, to the\nbuildup\nof\ncalcium\nconcentration\nin\nthe\npresynaptic\nterminal during the stimulus trains. This residual calcium\nmay combine with the calcium influx elicited by the\nsubsequent single action potential to enhance directly the\nrelease of neurotransmitter, or may lead to biochemical\nmodifications of proteins in the presynaptic terminal\n(Magleby and Zengel, 1982; Zucker and Regehr, 2002).\nAt some synapses, repetitive activation leads to depres-\nsion that can last for several seconds or even minutes (Betz,\n1970; Zucker and Regehr, 2002). As in paired-pulse\ndepression, this generally occurs in synapses that exhibit a\nhigh probability of release, and is thought to result, at least\nin part, from a transient depletion of the release-ready pool\nof synaptic vesicles. The decrease in synaptic strength can\nalso arise from the release of modulatory substances from\nthe activated presynaptic terminals, postsynaptic cells, or\neven neighboring cells, initiating a signaling cascade that\nleads to inhibition of the presynaptic release machinery.\nFinally, a postsynaptic mechanism of short-term plasticity\nmay involve desensitization of ligand-gated receptors,\nmaking the target neuron less sensitive to neurotransmitter.\nA key characteristic of depression at many synapses is use\ndependence. Higher levels of transmission are associated\nwith larger depression, and reduction of baseline transmis-\nsion (eg, by reducing external calcium concentration)\nrelieves depression.\nModulation of Transmission by Presynaptic\nReceptors\nMost presynaptic terminals possess a number of different\ntypes of metabotropic G-protein-coupled receptors, as well\nas ionotropic receptors (MacDermott et al, 1999). The\nprobability of transmitter release, a significant factor in\ndefining synaptic strength, is controlled in part by the\noccupancy of these receptors, which in turn is set by the\nextracellular concentrations of their agonists. In some cases,\ntonic levels of endogenous ligands are sufficient to partially\nactivate the receptors. Nonetheless, synaptic activity can\nfurther increase receptor occupancy by transiently elevating\nthe concentration of various presynaptic neuromodulators\n(Thompson et al, 1993; Miller, 1998). Depending on their\nspecific properties, activation of these receptors can either\nenhance or depress synaptic transmission.\nVia the release of a number of different neuromodulators,\npostsynaptic\ncells\ncan\nalso\ninfluence\nthe\nrelease\nof\ntransmitter from presynaptic terminals. A common scenar-\nio is that in response to strong postsynaptic depolarization,\ndendrites release retrograde messengers that act through G-\nprotein-coupled receptors located on presynaptic terminals\nto influence neurotransmitter release. Retrograde messen-\ngers that have been identified in specific cell types include\ndopamine, dynorphin, glutamate, GABA, nitric oxide,\nbrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and oxytocin\n(Drake et al, 1994; Kombian et al, 1997; Llano et al, 1991;\nNaggapan and Lu, 2005; Nugent et al, 2007; Pitler and Alger,\n1992; Zilberter, 2000; Zilberter et al, 1999). Although\npostsynaptic, calcium-dependent fusion of vesicles is one\ncommon mechanism for the release of retrograde messen-\ngers, they can also released by non-vesicular mechanisms.\nFor example, a widespread, extensively studied system for\nmediating retrograde synaptic signaling involves the post-\nsynaptic release of endogenous cannabinoids, such as\nanandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, which are pro-\nduced upon demand by cleavage of phospholipids and are\nsensed by CB1 receptors on presynaptic terminals. The\nmechanisms of endocannabinoid release are unclear and\nmay involve a transporter, which facilitates diffusion across\nthe plasma membrane (Chevaleyre et al, 2006) Such\nretrograde signaling by postsynaptic release of endocanna-\nbinoids can be initiated by strong depolarization or\nactivation of postsynaptic metabotropic receptors and has\nbeen shown to transiently suppress inhibitory and excita-\ntory synapses in several brain regions (Chevaleyre et al,\n2006). Importantly, in the striatum, there is a form of LTD\n(to be discussed below) that is triggered by the release of\nendocannabinoids.\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n19\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\nInvolvement of Glia in Short-Term Plasticity\nThere is growing realization that glia may be involved in\nsome forms of short-term plasticity (Araque et al, 2001;\nHaydon,\n2001).\nWith\ntheir\nintimate\nassociation\nwith\nsynapses, astrocytes and perisynaptic Schwann cells are\nwell\npositioned\nto\nregulate\nsynapses.\nThey\nhave\nan\nestablished role in clearance of neurotransmitter and may\nparticipate in synaptic plasticity by controlling the speed\nand extent of such clearance (Bergles et al, 1999; Danbolt,\n2001). This can in turn impact on the degree of postsynaptic\nreceptor activation and desensitization. Another way that\nglia may be involved in synaptic plasticity is by sensing\nextracellular messengers and then releasing substances that\nin turn can directly affect synaptic efficacy (Araque et al,\n2001; Haydon, 2001). For example, glia express many\ndifferent neurotransmitter receptors (eg, glutamate recep-\ntors), which when activated result in the release of\nsubstances (eg, ATP) that can then act on presynaptic\nterminals to regulate neurotransmitter release.\nFunctions of Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity\nShort-term synaptic plasticity was originally established as\nbehaviorally important from studies of simple organisms\nsuch as Aplysia (Kandel and Tauc, 1965). In the mammalian\nbrain, an important consequence of short-term synaptic\nplasticity\nis\nto\ninfluence\nthe\ninformation\nprocessing\nfunction of synapses, enabling them to act as filters with a\nwide range of properties. For example, synapses with a low\ninitial probability of release function as high-pass filters,\nsince they will facilitate during high-frequency action\npotential bursts while low-frequency bursts will not be\ntransmitted with the same efficacy. In contrast, synapses\nwith a high initial probability of release function as low-pass\nfilters, since they will depress during high-frequency bursts\nbut will reliably relay low-frequency activity (Abbott and\nRegehr, 2004). The filtering characteristics of a synapse can\nbe adjusted through modulation of the initial release\nprobability. This most commonly occurs due to the release\nof neuromodulators that, via activation of presynaptic\nreceptors, reduce the probability of release. This changes\nthe filtering characteristics of the synapse, causing facilita-\ntion to become predominant over depression. In this way,\npresynaptic inhibition can convert a synapse from a low-\npass to a high-pass filter.\nLONG-TERM SYNAPTIC PLASTICIY\nIt is widely believed that experience of any sort modifies\nsubsequent behavior at least in part through activity-\ndependent, long-lasting modifications of synaptic strength.\nThe brain encodes external and internal events as complex,\nspatio-temporal patterns of activity in large ensembles\nof neurons that can be conceptualized as \u2018neural circuits\u2019.\nA key feature defining the behavior of any given neural\ncircuit is the pattern of synaptic weights that connect\nthe individual neurons that comprise the circuit. A corollary\nto this hypothesis is that new information is stored\n(ie, memories are generated) when activity in a circuit\ncauses a long-lasting change in the pattern of synaptic\nweights. This idea was put forward over 100 years ago\nby the Spanish Nobel laureate Santiago Ramon y Cajal,\nand was further advanced in the late 1940s by Donald\nHebb,\nwho\nproposed\nthat\nassociative\nmemories\nare\nformed in the brain by a process of synaptic modification\nthat strengthens connections when presynaptic activity\ncorrelates with postsynaptic firing (Hebb, 1949). This\nproposed\nfunction\nfor\nsynaptic\nplasticity,\nforming\na\nmemory trace following the detection of two coincident\nevents, suggests an appealing cellular basis for behavioral\nphenomena\nsuch\nas\nPavlovian\nclassical\nconditioning\n(Pavlov, 1927).\nExperimental support for the very existence of such\nlong-lasting,\nactivity-dependent\nchanges\nin\nsynaptic\nstrength was lacking until the early 1970s when Bliss\nand colleagues (Bliss and Gardner-Medwin, 1973; Bliss\nand Lomo, 1973) reported that repetitive activation of\nexcitatory synapses in the hippocampus caused a potentia-\ntion of synaptic strength that could last for hours or even\ndays. Over the last three decades, this phenomenon,\neventually termed LTP, has been the object of intense\ninvestigation because it is widely believed that it provides an\nimportant key to understanding some of the cellular and\nmolecular mechanisms by which memories are formed\n(Martin et al, 2000; Pastalkova et al, 2006; Whitlock et al,\n2006).\nAlthough still considered prototypic, it is now clear that\nhippocampal LTP is only one of several different forms of\nlong-term synaptic plasticity that exist in specific circuits in\nthe mammalian brain. Importantly, it is well established\nthat most synapses that exhibit LTP also express one or\nmore forms of LTD. Thus, a key concept is that synaptic\nstrength at excitatory synapses is bidirectionally modifiable\nby different patterns of activity. Furthermore, it is now clear\nthat the terms \u2018LTP\u2019 and \u2018LTD\u2019 describe a class of\nphenomena, the underlying mechanisms of which vary\ndepending on the circuits in which they function.\nAdditional forms of synaptic plasticity more recently\nidentified\ninclude\nhomeostatic\nplasticity\n(Turrigiano\nand\nNelson,\n2004) and\nmetaplasticity\n(Abraham\nand\nBear, 1996). The major form of homeostatic plasticity is\n\u2018synaptic scaling\u2019, which describes phenomena whereby\nthe strength of all synapses on a given cell are adjusted in\nresponse to prolonged changes in activity. Specifically,\nprolonged decreases in overall activity cause a net scaling\nup of total synaptic strengths while prolonged increases in\nactivity cause the opposite, a scaling down of synaptic\nstrengths. This form of plasticity operates on a much\nslower timescale than LTP or LTD and may be parti-\ncularly\nimportant\nduring\nthe\ndevelopment\nof\nneural\ncircuits. Metaplasticity refers to the effects that activity\ncan have on the capacity of synapses to express long-term\nplasticity.\nThe most extensively studied and therefore prototypic\nforms of synaptic plasticity are the LTP and LTD observed\nin the CA1 region of the hippocampus (Figure 1), which are\ntriggered by activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)\nreceptors (NMDARs). We will therefore begin with a\ndiscussion of their underlying mechanisms. We will then\nproceed to reviewing some of the other prominent forms of\nLTP and LTD for which mechanisms have been most firmly\nestablished.\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n20\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\nNMDAR-Dependent LTP\nNo form of plasticity has generated more interest, or been\nmore extensively studied than LTP in the CA1 region of the\nhippocampus. The excitement surrounding this phenom-\nenon is due to compelling evidence from rodents, primates,\nand humans associating the hippocampus with a neural\nsystem involved in various forms of long-term memory\n(Martin et al, 2000; Zola-Morgan and Squire, 1993).\nFurthermore, several basic properties of LTP make it an\nattractive cellular mechanism for rapid information storage.\nSimilar to memory, LTP can be generated rapidly and is\nstrengthened and prolonged by repetition. It also exhibits\ncooperativity, associativity, and input specificity. (Nicoll\net al, 1988). Cooperativity means that LTP can be induced\nby the coincident activation of a critical number of\nsynapses. Associativity is the capacity to potentiate a weak\ninput (a small number of synapses) when it is activated in\nassociation with a strong input (a larger number of\nsynapses). As such, associativity is a cellular analogue of\nclassical conditioning and is an implicit property of the so-\ncalled Hebbian synapse. Input specificity indicates that LTP\nis elicited only at activated synapses and not at adjacent,\ninactive synapses on the same postsynaptic cell. This feature\ndramatically increases the storage capacity of individual\nneurons since different synapses on the same cell can be\ninvolved in separate circuits encoding different bits of\ninformation.\nA major technological advance in the study of synaptic\nplasticity was the development of the hippocampal slice\npreparation that made LTP accessible to rigorous experi-\nmental analysis (Figure 1b). Indeed, the bulk of our\nknowledge on the molecular mechanisms of LTP has been\nderived from studies of LTP at excitatory synapses on CA1\npyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices. Similar or\nidentical forms of LTP have been observed at excitatory\nsynapses throughout the brain. Thus, the conclusions drawn\nfrom the study of LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region are\noften applied to other brain regions.\nTriggering NMDAR-dependent LTP. A major advance in\nthe understanding of excitatory synaptic function and LTP\nwas the demonstration that two major types of ionotropic\nglutamate receptors contribute to the postsynaptic response\nat glutamatergic synapses, a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-\nisoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors (AMPARs) and\nNMDARs (Figure 1c). These receptors are often (although\nnot always, as will be elaborated upon later) found\nAMPAR\nNMDAR\nMg2+\nMg2+\nNa+\nCa2+\nNa+\nNa+\nDepolarization\n2\n2\n1\n0\n10 20 30 40 50\n0\n10 20 30 40 50\n50\n100\n150\n200\nTime (min)\nTime (min)\nLTP\nLTD\nfEPSP slope (%)\n1\n2\n1\n50\n100\n150\n200\nRec\nCA1\nStim\nCA3\nSC\nDG\nMF\nFigure 1\nNMDAR-dependent LTP and LTD at hippocampal CA1 synapses.

(c) Model of synaptic transmission at excitatory synapses. During basal synaptic transmission (left panel), synaptically released glutamate binds\nboth the NMDA and AMPARs. Na + flows through the AMPAR channel but not through the NMDAR channel because of the Mg2 + block of this channel.\nDepolarization of the postsynaptic cell (right) relieves the Mg2 + block of the NMDAR channel and allows both Na + and Ca2 + to flow into the dendritic\nspine. The resultant increase in Ca2 + in the dendritic spine is necessary for triggering the subsequent events that drive synaptic plasticity.\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n21\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\ncolocalized on individual dendritic spines. The AMPAR has\na channel that is permeable to monovalent cations (Na +\nand K +), and activation of AMPARs provides most of the\ninward current that generates the excitatory synaptic\nresponse when the cell is close to its resting membrane\npotential. In contrast to AMPARs, the NMDAR exhibits a\nstrong voltage dependence because of the block of its\nchannel at negative membrane potentials by extracellular\nmagnesium (Mayer et al, 1984; Nowak et al, 1984). As a\nresult,\nNMDARs\ncontribute\nlittle\nto\nthe\npostsynaptic\nresponse during basal synaptic activity. However, when\nthe cell is depolarized, magnesium dissociates from its\nbinding site within the NMDAR channel, allowing ions to\nenter the cell. Importantly, unlike AMPAR channels, the\nNMDAR channel allows calcium as well as sodium to enter\nthe postsynaptic dendritic spine (Figure 1c).\nIt is firmly established that the triggering (also termed the\ninduction) of LTP in the CA1 region requires activation of\nNMDARs during strong postsynaptic depolarization leading\nto\na\nincrease\nin\npostsynaptic\ncalcium\nconcentration,\nwhich likely has to reach some critical threshold value to\nactivate the biochemical processes necessary for LTP\n(Malenka, 1991; Malenka and Nicoll, 1993). Experimentally,\nthis is normally achieved by applying high-frequency\ntetanic stimulation to the synapses or by use of a \u2018pairing-\nprotocol\u2019 during which the postsynaptic cell is directly\ndepolarized while low-frequency synaptic activation is\nsustained. An additional method for induction of LTP (as\nwell as LTD) involves protocols that generate so-called\n\u2018spike-time dependent plasticity\u2019 (STDP; Dan and Poo, 2006;\nMarkram et al, 1997). In studies of STDP, LTP is induced\nif afferent stimulation generates a synaptic response within\na\ndiscrete\ntime\nwindow\nprior\nto\nthe\nfiring\nof\nthe\npostsynaptic cell.\nBecause its contribution to postsynaptic reponses re-\nquires both presynaptic release of glutamate and post-\nsynaptic depolarization due to the simultaneous activation\nof a population of synapses, the NMDAR is often referred to\nas a \u2018coincidence detector\u2019. These properties of NMDARs\nalso explain the basic properties of LTP. Cooperativity and\nassociativity occur because of the requirement for multiple\nsynapses\nto\nbe\nactivated\nsimultaneously\nto\ngenerate\nadequate postsynaptic depolarization to remove the mag-\nnesium block of the NMDAR. Input specificity is due to the\ncompartmentalized increase in calcium, which is limited to\nthe postsynaptic dendritic spine and does not influence\nadjacent spines (Nicoll et al, 1988).\nLTP\nsignal\ntransduction\nmechanisms.\nAn\nextensive\nnumber\nof\nsignal\ntransduction\nmolecules\nhave\nbeen\nsuggested to play a role in translating the calcium signal\nthat is required to trigger LTP into the long-lasting increase\nin synaptic strength (Malenka and Bear, 2004; Sanes and\nLichtman, 1999). However, only for a handful of these has\ncompelling evidence of a mandatory role in LTP been\npresented. A major limitation of much of the literature on\nthis topic stems from inadequate distinctions between\nmolecules that are key components of the molecular\nmachinery directly responsible for the triggering of LTP\n(\u2018mediators\u2019), and those molecules which may modulate\nthe ability to generate LTP, or play a permissive role\n(\u2018modulators\u2019). Some basic criteria that can be suggested for\ndefining the role of a protein as a mediator of LTP induction\nare: (1) blocking the activation of the molecule during LTP\ninduction blocks LTP; and (2) activation of the molecule\ninduces a potentiation of synaptic transmission, which\noccludes further synaptic induction of LTP.\nStrong\nevidence\nindicates\nthat\ncalcium/calmodulin\n(CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) fulfills these\nrequirements and is a key component of the molecular\nmachinery for LTP. CaMKII undergoes autophosphoryla-\ntion after the triggering of LTP (Barria et al, 1997; Fukunaga\net al, 1995), and LTP induction was prevented both in\nknockout mice lacking a critical CaMKII subunit (Silva\net al, 1992), and in knock-in animals in which endogenous\nCaMKII was replaced with a form lacking the autopho-\nsphorylation site (Giese et al, 1998). Furthermore, inhibition\nof CaMKII activity by directly loading postsynaptic cells\nwith peptides that impair CaMKII function blocks LTP\n(Malenka et al, 1989; Malinow et al, 1989), whereas acutely\nincreasing the postsynaptic concentration of active CaMKII\nincreases synaptic strength and occludes LTP (Lledo et al,\n1995; Pettit et al, 1994).\nSeveral other kinases have been implicated in the\ntriggering of LTP, but the experimental evidence supporting\ntheir role is not as well substantiated as that for CaMKII.\nActivation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-depen-\ndent protein kinase (PKA), perhaps by the activation of a\ncalmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase, has been suggested\nto boost the activity of CaMKII indirectly by decreasing\ncompeting protein phosphatase activity (Blitzer et al, 1998;\nLisman, 1989; Makhinson et al, 1999). This presumably\nhappens by phosphorylation of inhibitor 1, an endogenous\ninhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). The extracellular\nsignal-regulated\nkinase\n(Erk)/mitogen-activated\nprotein\nkinase (MAPK) pathway has also been suggested to be\nimportant for LTP, as well as some forms of learning and\nmemory (Sweatt, 2004; Thomas and Huganir, 2004). In\naddition, Src kinase has been implicated in the enhance-\nment of NMDAR function during LTP induction (Kalia\net al, 2004). Finally, protein kinase C and in particular the\natypical\nPKC\nisozyme,\nPKMz,\nhas\nreceived\nattention\nbecause this isozyme is rapidly expressed upon induction\nof LTP and recent studies have implicated PKMz in the\nmaintenance of the late phase of LTP both in hippocampal\nslices and in vivo (Hrabetova and Sacktor, 1996; Ling et al,\n2002; Pastalkova et al, 2006; Serrano et al, 2005).\nObviously, it remains a very challenging task to be able to\ndefinitively identify the key intracellular signaling cascades\nresponsible for the triggering of LTP. Recent technical\nadvances in mass spectrometric techniques for the profiling\nof post-transcriptional modifications in mixed populations\nof proteins, as well as the practicality of RNAi approaches\nfor knockdown of candidate proteins, should help further\ncharacterize the major LTP players and their dynamic\ninterplay.\nExpression mechanisms of LTP. In the past, a major point\nof contention was whether LTP was primarily expressed\npostsynaptically as a change in AMPAR properties or\npresynaptically, as a change in the probability of transmitter\nrelease. This latter expression mechanism garnered sig-\nnificant attention because it required the production of a\nretrograde messenger that was released by postsynaptic\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n22\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\ncells and acted on presynaptic terminals (for a thorough\nreview of the evidence for either locus of expression, see\nNicoll, 2003). To a large extent, this controversy has been\nresolved, with the emerging consensus that the major\nmechanism of expression of LTP at hippocampal CA1\nsynapses involves an increase in the numbers of AMPARs\nwithin the postsynaptic density, driven through activity-\ndependent changes in AMPAR trafficking (Bredt and Nicoll,\n2003; Derkach et al, 2007; Malenka and Nicoll, 1999;\nMalinow and Malenka, 2002; Song and Huganir, 2002).\nA major contribution to ending the controversy was the\nproposal of the silent synapse hypothesis and the evidence\nsupporting it (Durand et al, 1996; Isaac et al, 1995; Liao\net al, 1995; Malenka and Nicoll, 1997). Silent synapses are\nsynapses that contain only NMDARs with few or no\nAMPARs, such that at normal resting membrane potentials\nthese synapses exhibit no detectable postsynaptic responses\nto synaptically released glutamate. The \u2018unsilencing\u2019 of these\nsynapses during the induction of LTP is thought to occur\nthrough the incorporation of AMPARs into the postsynaptic\nplasma membrane. This hypothesis was quickly expanded\nto include synapses that already contained AMPARs and\nhas led to a large investigative effort into the molecular\nmechanisms regulating the trafficking of AMPARs (Bredt\nand Nicoll, 2003; Collingridge et al, 2004; Malinow and\nMalenka, 2002; Sheng and Kim, 2002; Song and Huganir,\n2002).\nMost\nAMPARs\nin\nthe\ncentral\nnervous\nsystem\nare\ntetramers comprised of four glutamate receptor subunits,\nGluR1\u2013GluR4. Although these subunits are highly homo-\nlogous, both the functional properties of AMPARs and their\ntrafficking has been suggested to depend on their subunit\ncomposition (Collingridge et al, 2004; Derkach et al, 2007;\nMalinow and Malenka, 2002). In the adult hippocampus,\ntwo forms of AMPARs are thought to predominate: GluR1/\nGluR2 heteromers and GluR2/GluR3 heteromers (Wenthold\net al, 1996). Based on clever overexpression studies, one\nprominent hypothesis suggests that subunit-specific rules\ngovern the synaptic delivery of AMPARs (Hayashi et al,\n2000; Passafaro et al, 2001; Shi et al, 2001). Specifically, it\nhas been suggested that the insertion of GluR1-containing\nAMPARs into synapses is slow under basal conditions and\nis strongly stimulated by NMDAR activation, whereas\ninsertion of GluR2/3 heteromeric receptors may occur\nconstitutively on a much more rapid timescale.\nWhere do these new AMPARs come from and how is their\ntrafficking regulated at a molecular level? Current evidence\nsuggests that recycling endosomes in the dendrites contain\na reserve pool of AMPARs that are mobilized during LTP\nvia a process that requires the small GTP-binding protein,\nRab11a (Park et al, 2004) (Figure 2). Surprisingly, AMPARs\ndo not appear to be inserted directly into the postsynaptic\ndensity (PSD) but rather are exocytosed at perisynaptic\nsites. They then can laterally diffuse in the plasma\nmembrane and be trapped within the PSD due to their\ninteractions with so-called \u2018slot proteins\u2019, which function to\ntrap AMPARs and greatly reduce their lateral mobility.\nAttractive candidates for these slot proteins are a family of\nproteins found in the PSD termed MAGUKs (for mem-\nbrane-associated guanylate kinases). MAGUKS are defined\nby\ntheir\nmultiple\nprotein\ninteraction\ndomains,\nmost\nimportantly so-called PDZ domains. Prominent members\nof the MAGUK family of PSD proteins include PSD-95,\nSAP97, PSD-93, and SAP102 (Kim and Sheng, 2004;\nMontgomery et al, 2004). PSD-95 has received the most\nattention and its level appears to be particularly important\nfor controlling the number of AMPARs at individual\nsynapses as evidenced by the findings that overexpression\nof PSD-95 increases synaptic strength and occludes LTP\n(Ehrlich and Malinow, 2004; Stein et al, 2003), whereas\nknockdown of PSD-95 decreases surface expression of\nAMPARs and synaptic strength (Ehrlich et al, 2007; Schluter\net al, 2006).\nThe influence of PSD-95, as well as other MAGUKS (Elias\net al, 2006; Futai et al, 2007; Schluter et al, 2006), on\nAMPARs was surprising given that PSD-95 was originally\nisolated because of its strong interaction with NMDARs\n(Kornau et al, 1995). Another major surprise was that\nAMPARs do not directly bind to MAGUKs but rather do so\nvia a family of AMPAR auxiliary subunits termed trans-\nmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs). TARPs\nare required for the delivery of AMPARs to the plasma\nmembrane at extrasynaptic sites (Chen et al, 2000; Nicoll\net al, 2006) and also influence their biophysical properties\n(Tomita et al, 2005a). Importantly, they are also required\nfor the synaptic localization of AMPARs due to their direct\ninteraction with MAGUKs (Schnell et al, 2002).\nThe detailed molecular mechanisms by which activation\nof protein kinases such as CaMKII lead to the synaptic\ndelivery of AMPARs remains to be determined. Phosphor-\nylation of AMPAR subunits themselves by CaMKII does not\nappear critical (Esteban et al, 2003; Lee et al, 2003) although\nother phosphorylation sites, such as the PKA or the PKC\nsites on GluR1, may be important (Boehm et al, 2006;\nEsteban et al, 2003). On the other hand, there is reasonable\nevidence that phosphorylation of TARPs occurs following\nCAMKII activation (Tsui and Malenka, 2006) and that this\nmay be critical for LTP (Tomita et al, 2005b). It is, however,\nhighly likely that AMPARs and TARPs are just a component\nof a large complex of proteins, the phosphorylation of which\nwill be required for LTP expression.\nLTP also appears to involve a phosphorylation-driven\nincrease in the single-channel conductance of AMPARs\nthemselves (Benke et al, 1998; Soderling and Derkach,\n2000). Indeed, CaMKII phosphorylates Ser831 in the\nintracellular C terminus of GluR1, resulting in a significant\nincrease in single-channel conductance of homomeric\nGluR1 receptors (Derkach et al, 1999, 2007). However, one\nimportant caveat of this conclusion is that synaptic GluR1-\ncontaining AMPARs also contain GluR2, and in GluR1/2\nheteromeric AMPARs, the enhanced conductance upon\nphosphorylation by CaMKII is absent (Oh and Derkach,\n2005).\nAlthough the evidence to date suggests a more prominent\nrole for AMPAR exocytosis, the relative contribution of\nAMPAR trafficking and changes in the biophysical proper-\nties of AMPARs to the increase in synaptic strength during\nLTP are not well defined. One model for the successive\nevents occurring during the first hour of LTP involves\nactivation of calcium-dependent signal transduction path-\nways, notably CaMKII, resulting in phosphorylation of\nGluR1-containing receptors and an increase in their single-\nchannel conductance. Roughly simultaneously, AMPARs\nare translocated into the PSD via exocytosis and lateral\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n23\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\nmovement within the plasma membrane. Most investigators\nbelieve that the incorporation of AMPARs into the PSD is\nthe more important change because it appears to be\naccompanied by structural changes in the dendritic spines\nand synapses themselves, an attractive mechanism for\nmaintaining LTP (see below). There are also experimental\nfindings consistent with rapid presynaptic changes during\nLTP, but the retrograde messenger that is responsible\nremains elusive, one prominent possibility being BDNF\n(Bramham and Messaoudi, 2005).\nMaintaining\nLTP.\nMuch\nof\nthe\nwork\non\nNMDAR-\ndependent LTP has focused on the mechanisms responsible\nfor its initial 30\u201360 min, to a large extent because of\ntechnical limitations in the duration over which stable\nelectrophysiological recordings can be maintained. None-\ntheless, the mechanisms that allow LTP to persist for hours,\ndays, or even longer are of great importance. Like virtually\nall cell biological phenomena, the persistence of LTP is\ndependent upon new protein synthesis (Reymann and Frey,\n2007). This so-called \u2018late phase of LTP\u2019 (defined as the\npotentiation present more than 1\u20132 h after LTP induction)\nis commonly assumed to depend upon local dendritic\nprotein synthesis, which supplies needed components to the\nsynapse (Sutton and Schuman, 2006), as well as transcrip-\ntion in the nucleus (Zhou et al, 2006). The signaling to the\nnucleus required for long-lasting LTP has been suggested to\ndepend on a number of protein kinases including PKA,\nCaMKIV, and Erk-MAPK, which activate key transcription\nfactors that may include cAMP response element-binding\nprotein and immediate-early genes such as c-Fos and\nZif268/Egr-1 (Thomas and Huganir, 2004). These transcrip-\ntional\ncomplexes\npresumably\npromote\nexpression\nof\neffector genes that are required for maintaining the synaptic\nenhancement.\nSeveral mRNAs can be found in dendrites, including\nthose of the AMPARs themselves, CaMKII, Arc, and\nproteins which may function to regulate receptor trafficking\n(Grooms et al, 2006; Job and Eberwine, 2001; Ju et al, 2004;\nMayford et al, 1996; Schuman et al, 2006; Steward and\nSchuman, 2001). The trafficking of some of these mRNAs\nand their local translation seems to be highly regulated by\nactivity. Furthermore, other components of the translational\nmachinery are found in or adjacent to dendritic spines and\npolyribosomes are recruited to spine heads following LTP\ninduction (Bourne et al, 2007). Thus, there is accumulating\nevidence that the machinery to provide local, newly\nsynthesized proteins to synapses is available.\nAn intriguing hypothesis is that during the synaptic\nactivation to induce LTP a \u2018synaptic tag\u2019 is generated that\nfunctions to capture or sequester plasticity related proteins,\nwhich in turn are required to stabilize the increase in\nsynaptic strength (Frey and Morris, 1997). However, little is\nknown about the identity of the synaptic tag or the newly\nsynthesized proteins that are required to maintain LTP,\nalthough it has been suggested that PKA, CAMKII, or PKMz\nmight function as the synaptic tag (Reymann and Frey,\n2007; Sajikumar et al, 2005; Young et al, 2006).\nA compelling possibility for a long-term maintenance\nmechanism\nof\nLTP\nis\nthe\nstructural\nremodeling\nof\nAMPAR\nNMDAR\nEndocytosis\nRecycling\nExocytosis\nAMPAR\nNMDAR\nAMPAR\nNMDAR\nCa2+\nCaMKII\nCa2+\nCalcineurin \nPP1\nLTP\nLTD\nRab11a\nFigure 2\nModel of AMPAR trafficking during LTP and LTD. In the basal state (depicted on top), receptors cycle between the postsynaptic membrane and\nintracellular compartments. This is achieved through lateral mobility of the receptors out of the synapse into endocytic zones, where they are endocytosed\ninto early endosomes in a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent manner. Normally, the receptors are transferred to recycling endosomes and returned to the\nplasma membrane by exocytosis, followed by lateral movement into the synapse where they are retained through interaction with MAGUKs. Following\ninduction of LTP, there is enhanced receptor exocytosis and stabilization at the synapse through a calcium-driven process that involves CAMKII and fusion of\nrecycling endosomes mediated by Rab11a. Following the induction of LTD, enhanced endocytosis at extrasynaptic sites occurs in a process that is calcium-\ndependent and involves protein phosphatases, primarily calcineurin and protein phosphatases 1 (PP1). While in the basal state endocytosis is presumably\nbalanced by receptor recycling, following LTD receptors are retained within the cell, and perhaps degraded.\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n24\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\npotentiated synapses (Luscher et al, 2000). Spines come in a\nvariety of shapes and sizes, and can undergo rapid shape\nchanges\nthat\nare\ninfluenced\nby\nactivity\n(Yuste\nand\nBonhoeffer, 2001). Morphological changes which have been\nreported\nto\naccompany LTP\ninclude\ngrowth\nof new\ndendritic spines, enlargement of preexisiting spines and\ntheir PSDs, and the splitting of single PSDs and spines into\ntwo functional synapses (Abraham and Williams, 2003;\nMatsuzaki et al, 2004; Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2001). An\nattractive\nmodel\nsuggests\nthat\nduring\nLTP,\nrecycling\nendosomes contribute AMPAR subunits to the synapse, as\nwell as lipids and constituents which enlarge the synapse\n(Lisman and Zhabotinsky, 2001; Luscher et al, 2000; Park\net al, 2004, 2006). At some later time point, there is likely a\nconcomitant increase in the presynaptic active zone, the size\nof which always closely matches that of the PSD (Lisman\nand Harris, 1993). This presynaptic re-modeling must\ninvolve post- and presynaptic protein interactions with\nlikely candidates being cell adhesion molecules such as the\ncadherins or neuroligin/neurexin interactions.\nSummary. The current view of the mechanisms underlying\nthis form of LTP can be summarized as follows (Figure 2). A\nlarge\nNMDAR-dependent\nincrease\nin\ndendritic\nspine\ncalcium concentrations leads to activation of intracellular\nsignaling cascades involving a number of protein kinases,\nmost importantly CaMKII. This leads to an increase in the\nsingle-channel conductance of synaptic AMPARs and more\nimportantly, promotes the incorporation of additional\nAMPARs into the PSD. The new synaptic AMPARs are\nstabilized through their TARP-mediated interaction with\nPDZ domain-containing proteins such as PSD-95. In\nparallel, structural changes within the synapse occur, such\nthat the size of the PSD and dendritic spine are increased.\nThis in turn drives an increase in the size of the presynaptic\nactive\nzone\nsuch\nthat\nthe\npotentiated\nsynapses\nare\n\u2018permanently\u2019 enlarged. The maintenance of these changes\nfor more than a few hours depends on de novo transcription\nas well as local dendritic protein synthesis, presumbably to\nprovide the synapses with a supply of the critical proteins\nnecessary for maintaining synaptic strength.\nNMDAR-Dependent LTD\nAn important advance in the study of long-term synaptic\nplasticity was the establishment of an experimentally\nreproducible form of NMDAR-dependent LTD at excitatory\nsynapses on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (Dudek and\nBear, 1992). This demonstrated that activity could bi-\ndirectionally control synaptic strength (Mulkey and Malenka,\n1992), thus providing support for the idea that memories or\nexperiences were encoded by the distribution of synaptic\nweights in neural circuits, not simply by LTP. Shortly\nthereafter,\na\nsimilar\nform\nof\nLTD\nwas\nobserved\nat\nneocortical synapses (Kirkwood et al, 1993) suggesting that\nmechanistic studies in the hippocampal CA1 region could\nprovide\ninsights\nthat\napplied\nto\nexcitatory\nsynapses\nthroughout the brain. While that remains true to a large\nextent, we now know that in addition to NMDAR-dependent\nLTD, there are several other forms of LTD, which we will\ndiscuss in later sections. Moreover, similar to LTP, evidence\nis accumulating that LTD mechanisms may contribute to a\nlarge number of brain phenomena including experience-\ndependent development, learning and memory, addiction,\nand neurological disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and\nParkinson\u2019s disease (Malenka and Bear, 2004; Brebner et al,\n2005; Kreitzer and Malenka 2007; Hsieh et al, 2006).\nTriggering NMDAR-dependent LTD. The typical protocol\nfor\neliciting\nLTD\ninvolves\nprolonged\nrepetitive\nlow-\nfrequency stimulation (B900 stimuli at 1 Hz; Dudek and\nBear, 1992; Mulkey and Malenka, 1992), although the\nnumber of stimuli can be dramatically reduced and the\nfrequency changed if the postsynaptic neuron is modestly\ndepolarized (to B\u000250 mV), partially relieving the Mg2 +\nblock of the NMDAR (Selig et al, 1995). NMDAR-dependent\nLTD can also be induced by correctly timing the activation\nof presynaptic axons and the postsynaptic neuron (STDP;\n(Dan and Poo, 2006).\nLike LTP, LTD is input-specific and depends upon an\nNMDAR-dependent\nincrease\nin\npostsynaptic\ncalcium\n(Mulkey and Malenka, 1992). The predominant current\nhypothesis is that quantitative properties of the postsynap-\ntic calcium signal within dendritic spines dictates whether\nLTP or LTD is triggered, with LTD requiring a modest\nincrease in calcium (Cummings et al, 1996), whereas LTP\nrequires a increase beyond some critical threshold value\n(Malenka and Nicoll, 1993). The temporal characteristics of\nthe increase in calcium may also be important since\nchanging the relative timing between pre- and postsynaptic\nactivation by just a few tens of milliseconds can reverse the\ndirection of synaptic modification (Dan and Poo, 2006).\nDifferential buffering of postsynaptic calcium levels has\nbeen reported to enable a transition between LTP and LTD\n(Harney et al, 2006; Nishiyama et al, 2000). These findings\ndemonstrate the thin line that lies between synaptic activity\neliciting a potentiation vs a depression and provide support\nto the idea that both LTP and LTD are utilized in parallel for\nencoding experiences in vivo.\nLTD signal transduction mechanisms. An influential\nhypothesis for the signal transduction pathway triggering\nLTD suggested that while LTP was due to the preferential\nactivation of CaMKII, LTD involves activation of a calcium-\ndependent protein phosphatase cascade consisting of the\ncalcium/calmodulin-dependent\nphosphatase\ncalcineurin\n(also known as protein phosphatase 2B), PP1, and a\nphosphoprotein termed inhibitor-1 which functions to\ninhibit PP1 until it is dephosphorylated by calcineurin\n(Lisman, 1989). Consistent with this hypothesis, postsynap-\ntic inhibition of these phosphatases prevents LTD (Kirk-\nwood and Bear, 1994; Morishita et al, 2001; Mulkey et al,\n1994, 1993), whereas directly loading CA1 pyramidal cells\nwith PP1 enhances LTD (Morishita et al, 2001). Although\nsignaling proteins other than phosphatases have been\nsuggested to play key roles in LTD (Bolshakov et al, 2000;\nDan and Poo, 2006; Palmer et al, 2005; Peineau et al, 2007),\nthe hypothesis that LTP involves preferential activation of\nprotein kinases while LTD involves activation of phospha-\ntases remains predominant.\nLTD has been found to correlate with dephosphorylation\nof\npostsynaptic\nPKC\nand\nPKA\nsubstrates\nwithout\na\ndetectable change in CaMKII substrate phosphorylation\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n25\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\n(Hrabetova and Sacktor, 1996; Kameyama et al, 1998; Lee\net al, 2000, 1998. The evidence in support of a role for\ndephosphorylation\nof\nPKA\nsubstrates\nduring\nLTD\nis\nparticularly convincing, as postsynaptic inhibition of PKA,\nor its displacement from intracellular anchoring proteins,\ncause a rundown of synaptic transmission that occludes\nLTD. The mechanism underlying specific dephosphoryla-\ntion of PKA substrates during LTD could involve the\nNMDAR-dependent recruitment of PP1 to synapses (Mor-\nishita et al, 2001) or the selective loss of PKA from synapses\n(Gomez et al, 2002; Snyder et al, 2005). Consistent with a\nrole for PKA, LTD is associated with selective depho-\nsphorylation of Ser845 on GluR1, a PKA substrate site (Lee\net al, 2000). This dephosphorylation event may contribute\nto the expression of LTD, as it decreases the AMPAR open-\nchannel probability (Banke et al, 2000), and mice with\nknock-in alanine substitution of both Ser845 and Ser831 (a\nCaMKII-substrate site) exhibit impaired NMDAR-depen-\ndent LTD (Lee et al, 2003).\nExpression mechanisms of LTD. The demonstration of\nsilent synapses and their conversion to functional synapses\nduring LTP by the incorporation of AMPARs (Malenka and\nNicoll, 1997) immediately gave credence to the idea that the\nopposite might happen during LTD, that is, the removal or\nendocytosis of AMPARs. Consistent with this idea, it was\ndemonstrated that pharmacological manipulations of activ-\nity in cultured neurons (Carroll et al, 1999; Lissin et al,\n1998) or application of glutamate receptor agonists (Beattie\net al, 2000; Carroll et al, 1999; Ehlers, 2000; Heynen et al,\n2000; Lin et al, 2000; Lissin et al, 1998) could cause a loss of\nAMPARs from synapses due to dynamin- and clathrin-\ndependent endocytosis (Carroll et al, 2001; Collingridge\net al, 2004; Derkach et al, 2007; Malinow and Malenka,\n2002). Furthermore, postsynaptic inhibition of dynamin\nactivity impaired LTD in CA1 pyramidal cells in slices (Lee\net al, 2002; Luscher et al, 1999; Morishita et al, 2005). Based\nin large part on these sorts of observations, the current\nleading hypothesis is that the expression mechanism of\nNMDAR-dependent LTD is due to activity-dependent\nendocytosis of synaptic AMPARs (Bredt and Nicoll, 2003;\nCollingridge et al, 2004; Derkach et al, 2007; Malenka and\nBear, 2004; Malinow and Malenka, 2002) (Figure 2).\nThe precise molecular mechanisms by which endocytosis\nof AMPARs occurs during LTD is still not clear but one\nlikely scenario is that it involves dissociation of AMPARs\nfrom their anchors within the PSD, followed by lateral\nmovement to the edge of the PSD where they undergo\nclathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis (Ashby et al,\n2004; Blanpied et al, 2002; Groc et al, 2004). Consistent with\na key role for protein phosphatases, the endocytosis of\nAMPARs is regulated by calcium-dependent dephosphor-\nylation (Beattie et al, 2000; Carroll et al, 2001; Ehlers, 2000).\nKey substrates for facilitating endocytosis may include\ncomponents of the endocytic machinery (Carroll et al, 2001;\nLai et al, 1999; Slepnev et al, 1998) as well as AMPAR\nsubunits themselves (Ehlers, 2000). Following endocytosis,\nAMPARs exhibit increased colocalization with the clathrin\nadaptor protein AP2 (Carroll et al, 1999), an interaction that\nmay be promoted by the Ca2 +-dependent adaptor protein\nhippocalcin (Palmer et al, 2005).\nConsistent with a role for \u2018slot proteins\u2019 in the regulation\nof AMPAR surface levels, LTD has been reported to depend\non PP1-dependent dephosphorylation of stargazin (Tomita\net al, 2005b). This dephosphorylation might permit the\ndissociation of stargazin from PSD-95 and its diffusion out\nof the PSD, enabling LTD through loss of synaptic AMPARs\n(Ziff, 2007). Ubiquitination (Colledge et al, 2003) or\ndepalmitoylation (El-Husseini et al, 2002) of PSD-95 has\nalso been suggested to be critical for agonist-induced\nendocytosis of AMPARs but whether these events are\nrequired for synaptically induced LTD has not been\ndetermined. Additional proteins implicated in AMPAR\nendocytosis include the AMPAR interacting protein PICK1\n(Hanley and Henley, 2005; Kim et al, 2001), the small\nGTPases Rap1 (Zhu et al, 2002, 2005) and Rab5 (Brown\net al, 2005), and a protein termed cpg2 (Cottrell et al, 2004).\nIt has been suggested that particular AMPAR subunits,\nspecifically GluR2, may be especially important for the\nendocytosis of AMPARs during LTD, in part because of its\ndirect interaction with AP2 (Lee et al, 2002). One key\nfinding consistent with this hypothesis is that peptides that\nselectively interfere with this interaction have been reported\nto inhibit LTD (Lee et al, 2002). However, AP2 can bind\nother AMPAR subunits (Kastning et al, 2007; Lee et al,\n2002) and LTD is still observed in hippocampal slices\nobtained from mice lacking GluR2 as well as GluR2 and\nGluR3 (Jia et al, 1996; Meng et al, 2003). Thus, the\nimportance of specific AMPAR subunits for LTD is not\nfirmly established.\nSummary. A current simplified view of the mechanisms\nunderlying NMDAR-dependent LTD can be summarized as\nfollows (Figure 2): a modest increase in postsynaptic\ncalcium concentration within dendritic spines due to\nmodest activation of NMDARs leads to preferential activa-\ntion of protein phosphatases (as well as a few other key\nsignaling proteins). This leads to the dissociation of\nAMPARs from their molecular scaffolds in the PSD and\ntheir lateral movement to endocytic zones on the periphery\nof the PSD, where they are endocytosed and potentially\ndegraded. We have not discussed the maintenance of LTD\nbecause there is little work on this topic. There is evidence\nthat LTD is accompanied by a shrinkage in the size of\ndendritic spines (Nagerl et al, 2004; Zhou et al, 2004) and\nthat this may be due to the loss of AMPARs (Hsieh et al,\n2006). Furthermore, similar to LTP, protein translation may\nbe needed for the long-term stable expression of LTD\n(Pfeiffer and Huber, 2006). Thus, it is generally believed that\nthe activity-dependent trafficking of AMPARs into and out\nof synapses during LTP and LTD, respectively, is the first\ncritical step in the morphological growth or shrinkage of\nsynapses and that these structural modifications are the\nmechanisms by which bidirectional changes in synaptic\nstrength are maintained. Indeed, the size of individual\nsynapses correlates closely with the number of AMPARs\nthey contain (Matsuzaki et al, 2001; Nusser et al, 1998;\nTakumi et al, 1999).\nPresynaptic LTP\nAlthough the spotlight has been on NMDAR-dependent LTP\nfor over 30 years, it is clear that a mechanistically distinct\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n26\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\nform of plasticity coexists in the hippocampus at the so-\ncalled mossy fiber synapses, the synapses between the axons\nof dentate gyrus granule cells (ie, mossy fibers) and the\nproximal apical dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells (Nicoll\nand Malenka, 1995; Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005). Mossy fiber\nLTP (MF-LTP) is of increasing interest due to the fact that it\nappears to be a prototype for mechanistically similar forms\nof LTP found in several other brain regions including the\nthalamus at corticothalamic synapses (Castro-Alamancos\nand Calcagnotto, 1999), the cerebellum at parallel fiber-\nPurkinje cell synapses (Linden, 1997; Salin et al, 1996), and\nperhaps in the striatum at cortico-striatal synapses (Spencer\nand Murphy, 2002). Thus, like NMDAR-dependent LTP,\nthis form of LTP may play multiple functional roles in the\nbrain.\nIn contrast to NMDAR-dependent LTP, the triggering and\nexpression of this form of LTP is thought to be solely or\npredominantly presynaptic, thus we refer to it as presynap-\ntic LTP. While somewhat controversial, most experimental\nevidence suggests that presynaptic LTP is triggered by high-\nfrequency tetanic stimulation, which causes a large, activity-\ndependent increase in calcium concentration within pre-\nsynaptic axon terminals (Nicoll and Malenka, 1995; Nicoll\nand Schmitz, 2005; Zalutsky and Nicoll, 1990). Presynaptic\nvoltage-dependent calcium channels are the critical source\nof the calcium increase, although the triggering of this LTP\nat MF synapses can be facilitated by the activation of\npresynaptic kainate receptors, particularly GluR6 (Lauri\net al, 2001; Schmitz et al, 2003). Results from pharmaco-\nlogical manipulations and knockout mice are all consistent\nwith the hypothesis that the increase in presynaptic calcium\nactivates a calcium/calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase.\nThis leads to a increase in presynaptic cAMP and activation\nof PKA, which phosphorylates critical presynaptic sub-\nstrates to cause a long-lasting enhancement in transmitter\nrelease (Nicoll and Malenka, 1995; Nicoll and Schmitz,\n2005). Although this sequence of events is consistent with\nmost of the results from all of the synapses that have been\nreported to express presynaptic LTP, surprisingly, a very\ndifferent postsynaptic induction mechanism has been\nproposed to occur at MF synapses. This involves trans-\nsynaptic interactions between postsynaptic EphB receptor\ntyrosine kinases and presynaptic B-Ephrin ligands leading,\nvia an unknown mechanism, to a long-lasting enhancement\nof transmitter release (Armstrong et al, 2006; Contractor\net al, 2002).\nDespite some controversy concerning the mechanism\nunderlying the induction of presynaptic LTP at MF\nsynapses, there is general agreement that its expression is\ndue to an increase in neurotransmitter release. One\nmechanism\nfor\nmediating\na\nlong-lasting\nincrease\nin\ntransmitter release is to enhance the calcium influx into\nthe presynaptic terminal when it is invaded by an action\npotential; for example via a long-lasting modulation of\npresynaptic calcium channels. However, direct imaging of\nthe action potential-dependent increase in presynaptic\ncalcium in MF boutons indicates that no change occurs\nfollowing the triggering of MF-LTP (Kamiya et al, 2002;\nRegehr and Tank, 1991; Reid et al, 2004).\nThe other major mechanism for enhancing transmitter\nrelease is via some modulation of the machinery responsible\nfor synaptic vesicle exocytosis. In this context, the focus has\nbeen on presynaptic proteins known to be substrates for\nPKA. Because presynaptic terminals are relatively inacces-\nsible, an important approach has been examining knockout\nmice lacking specific presynaptic proteins. Mice lacking\nsynapsins exhibited normal MF-LTP (Spillane et al, 1995)\nindicating that these prominent PKA substrates were not\nnecessary. In contrast, knockout animals lacking the\nsynaptic vesicle protein Rab3A, a small GTPase (Castillo\net al, 1997; Lonart et al, 1998), or its binding partner, the\nactive zone protein Rim1a (Castillo et al, 2002; Powell et al,\n2004) lack both MF-LTP as well as presynaptic LTP in the\ncerebellum. Rim1a is a substrate of PKA and thus these\nfindings suggest that presynaptic LTP may require a GTP-\ndependent interaction between Rab3a and Rim1a at the\ninterface of synaptic vesicles and the active zone. Indeed,\nusing cultures of cerebellar neurons in which presynaptic\nLTP can be elicited, the critical residue phosphorylated by\nPKA in Rim1a has been identified (Lonart et al, 2003). One\nimportant caveat to this hypothesis, however, is that the\npresynaptic enhancement of synaptic transmission seen\nupon application of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin\nis unaltered in knockout mice lacking Rab3a or Rim1a. This\nprovides a complication for the simple model implicating\nRim1a and Rab3a as the crucial mediators of the enhanced\ntransmission caused by presynaptic activation of PKA.\nMetabotropic Glutamate Receptor-Dependent\nLTD\nUnder the appropriate experimental conditions, low-fre-\nquency stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural\ninputs to CA1 pyramidal cells can trigger, in addition to\nNMDAR-dependent LTD, a mechanistically distinct form of\nLTD, that is dependent upon activation of metabotropic\nglutamate receptors (mGluRs; mGLUR LTD) (Anwyl, 2006;\nBolshakov et al, 2000; Malenka and Bear, 2004; Oliet et al,\n1997). Various forms of mGluR LTD have been observed in\nmany brain regions, most notably at the parallel fiber to\nPurkinje cell synapse (Ito, 1989; Linden and Connor, 1995).\nThis so-called cerebellar LTD is elicited when parallel fibers\nare activated coincident with climbing fiber activation and\nhas been suggested to be particularly important for certain\nforms of motor learning.\nTypically, the induction of mGluR LTD in the CA1 region\nof the hippocampus requires bursts of afferent stimulation\nor paired-pulse stimulation at modest frequencies. Pre-\nsumably, this increases the likelihood of activating the\nextrasynaptic group I mGluRs that are required to trigger\nthis form of plasticity. mGluR LTD can also be elicited by\nbath application of group I mGluR agonists such as DHPG\n(Bellone and Luscher, 2005; Huber et al, 2000, 2001). Group\nI mGluRs (mGluR1 and mGluR5) are defined by their\ncapacity to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis and\nthereby produce diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate.\nAlthough mGluR1 is the principal receptor implicated in the\ninduction of mGluR LTD in the ventral tegmental area\n(VTA), cerebellum, and neostriatum, mGluR5 has been\nimplicated\nin\nthe\nhippocampus,\ncortex,\nand\nnucleus\naccumbens (Anwyl, 2006).\nThe intracellular signaling pathways responsible for\nmGluR LTD have not been extensively examined. PKC\nappears to be required for mGluR LTD in the cerebellum\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n27\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\n(De Zeeuw et al, 1998; Linden and Connor, 1991) and the\nVTA (Bellone and Luscher, 2005), but perhaps not in the\nhippocampus (Huang and Hsu, 2006). Other signaling\nproteins suggested to be important for mGluR LTD include\nthe MAPKs p38, Erk, and Jnk (Gallagher et al, 2004; Li et al,\n2007; Rush et al, 2002), tyrosine phosphatases (Huang and\nHsu, 2006; Moult et al, 2006), and phosphatidylinositol\n3-kinase (Hou and Klann, 2004) but how these various\nenzymes might lead to a long-lasting decrease in synaptic\nstrength is unknown.\nSimilar to NMDAR-dependent LTD, mGluR LTD in the\nhippocampus and cerebellum appears to involve clathrin-\ndependent endocytosis of AMPARs (Snyder et al, 2001;\nWang and Linden, 2000; Xiao et al, 2001). For cerebellar\nmGluR LTD, a large body of work is consistent with a\nspecific molecular model in which mGluR activation due to\nparallel fiber stimulation combined with calcium influx due\nto climbing fiber activation results in activation of PKCa\nand its targeting to synapses via the protein PICK1 (Jorntell\nand Hansel, 2006; Perez et al, 2001; Steinberg et al, 2006).\nPKCa then phosphorylates Ser880 on GluR2 causing GluR2\nto dissociate from the AMPAR-binding proteins GRIP/ABP\nand bind to PICK1. This then allows lateral diffusion of the\nAMPARs and ultimately internalization (Chung et al, 2003;\nSteinberg et al, 2006; Xia et al, 2000). This cascade of events\nis significantly different than those believed to occur during\nNMDAR-dependent LTD, pointing out that the molecular\nmechanisms underlying apparently similar forms of plasti-\ncity may be cell type-specific. Indeed, mGluR LTD at\nexcitatory synapses onto dopamine cells in the VTA has\nbeen suggested to involve a selective loss of AMPARs that\nlack the GluR2 subunit (Bellone and Luscher, 2005, 2006),\nrather than those that contain GluR2.\nAnother important feature of mGluR LTD, at least in the\nhippocampus, is that it appears to be dependent on mGluR-\ntriggered protein synthesis (Hou and Klann, 2004; Huber\net al, 2000, 2001; Snyder et al, 2001). This link between\nprotein synthesis and mGluR LTD gained considerable\nattention following the report that mice lacking the gene\nencoding the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)\nexhibited enhanced mGluR LTD in both the hippocampus\n(Huber et al, 2002) and the cerebellum (Koekkoek et al,\n2005). These mice serve as a model for the Fragile X\nsyndrome in humans, an X-linked form of mental retarda-\ntion, and exhibit several features of the human disorder\n(Bear et al, 2004). Surprisingly, the enhanced mGluR LTD\nobserved in the FMRP knockout mice is independent of\nprotein synthesis and proteasomal degradation (Hou et al,\n2006; Nosyreva and Huber, 2006), cellular processes that\nappear crucial for mGluR LTD in wild-type mice. Never-\ntheless, this potential link between an mGluR-triggered\nform of synaptic plasticity and Fragile X syndrome has\nfocused\nattention\non\nmGluR\nantagonists\nas\npossible\ntherapeutic agents for this and other developemental\ndisorders (Bear et al, 2004).\nThere are also results consistent with a presynaptic locus\nof expression for mGluR LTD (Anwyl, 2006; Nosyreva and\nHuber, 2005; Zakharenko et al, 2002). As these forms of\nmGluR LTD are still triggered postsynaptically, they must\ninvolve a retrograde messenger, one leading candidate being\n12-lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid (Feinmark\net al, 2003). In an attempt to reconcile the observations of a\npresynaptic locus of expression of mGluR LTD with the\nbulk of the literature describing a postsynaptic locus of\nexpression, a developmental shift in the mechanisms of\nmGluR LTD has been proposed (Nosyreva and Huber,\n2005). Specifically, it has been suggested that in slices\nprepared from neonatal (P8\u2013P15) animals, mGluR-LTD is\nindependent of protein synthesis and is due to a presynaptic\nmodification, whereas in older animals (P21\u2013P35) mGluR\nLTD is mediated by a protein synthesis-dependent reduc-\ntion in the postsynaptic levels of AMPARs.\nEndocannabinoid-Mediated LTD\nA major advance over the last decade has been the\ndemonstration of the existence of endogenous cannabinoids\n(termed endocannabinoids) and their roles in modulating\nsynaptic function (Chevaleyre et al, 2006; Freund et al, 2003;\nKreitzer and Regehr, 2002; Piomelli, 2003; Wilson and\nNicoll, 2002). It is now well established that in a number of\nbrain regions endocannabinoids are retrograde messengers\nthat are released by postsynaptic cells in response to strong\ndepolarization\nand/or\nactivation\nof\nG-protein-coupled\nreceptors (eg, mGluRs and muscarinic receptors) and\nfunction to transiently inhibit transmitter release (for\nB0.5\u20131 min) at either excitatory or inhibitory synpases\nvia activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors.\nMuch of the mechanistic work on the transient synaptic\neffects of endocannabinioids was performed in the hippo-\ncampus and cerebellum, synapses that are often thought to\nbe prototypic of synapses throughout the brain. It was\ntherefore surprising when a form of LTD that required\nendocannabinoids, (so-called endocannabinoid-mediated\nLTD; eCB-LTD) was observed in the glutamatergic synapses\nonto medium spiny neurons in the striatum as well as at\nsynapses between layer V pyramidal neurons (Gerdeman\net al, 2002; Robbe et al, 2002a; Sjostrom et al, 2003). In the\nhippocampus, in contrast, endocannabinoids mediate a\nform of LTD at inhibitory, but not excitatory, synapses\n(Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2004). In the dorsal striatum, eCB-\nLTD requires postsynaptic activation of group I mGluRs,\nL-type calcium channels and D2 dopamine receptors (Choi\nand Lovinger, 1997; Kreitzer and Malenka, 2005, 2007;\nPisani et al, 2005; Sung et al, 2001; Tang et al, 2001)\n(Figure 3). This leads to the production most likely of\nanandamide (Ade and Lovinger, 2007), which activates\npresynaptic CB1 receptors. However, prolonged activation\nof these CB1 receptors alone is not sufficient to elicit eCB-\nLTD; concomitant presynaptic activity is also required, a\nrequirement that likely accounts for the input specificity of\nthis form of plasticity (Singla et al, 2007). Another\nimportant feature of eCB-LTD in the dorsal striatum is\nthat it appears to be restricted to the medium spiny neurons\nthat primarily express D2 dopamine receptors and is not\npresent at excitatory synapses on cells expressing D1\nreceptors (Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007; but see Wang\net al, 2006). This cell-restricted expression of eCB-LTD\nmay have important functional implications, a topic to be\ndiscussed below.\nIn the nucleus accumbens (NAc), eCB-LTD also requires\npostsynaptic activation of group I mGluRs and is modulated\nby drugs of abuse (Fourgeaud et al, 2004; Mato et al, 2004;\nRobbe et al, 2002b). In the cortex, eCB-LTD can be elicited\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n28\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\nby a spike-timing-dependent protocol (Sjostrom et al, 2003)\nbut does not depend on postsynaptic activation of mGluRs\nand surprisingly, requires coincident activation of presy-\nnaptic NMDARs. LTD in the cerebellum was also reported\nto depend on retrograde endocannabinoid signaling (Safo\nand Regehr, 2005), but the mechanistic basis for this\nobservation is still unclear, since, as discussed above,\ncerebellar LTD is expressed postsynaptically.\nMetaplasticity\nMetaplasticity refers to a higher-order form of synaptic\nplasticity in which synaptic activity, which by itself does not\ndirectly affect synaptic efficacy, leads to a persistent change\nin the direction or magnitude of subsequent activity-\ndependent synaptic plasticity. In other words, metaplasti-\ncity is the \u2018plasticity of plasticity\u2019 (Abraham and Bear, 1996;\nBear et al, 1987). The best-studied examples of metaplas-\nticity are those in which prior activity shifts the threshold\nfor LTP and LTD induction. For example, in the hippo-\ncampus, repetitive activation of NMDARs in a manner that\ndoes not elicit LTP or LTD can nonetheless elicit a rapid\nshift in plasticity thresholds such that LTP becomes difficult\nto elicit and LTD induction is favored (Huang et al, 1992;\nWang and Wagner, 1999). A potential functional role for\nmetaplasticity has been demonstrated by modifying the\nlevel of activity during the development of the visual cortex\nin vivo (Philpot et al, 2001, 2003, 2007). This causes shifts in\nthe thresholds for LTP and LTD in cells in visual cortex\npresumably due to changes in the stoichiometry of synaptic\nNMDARs. As discussed below, such changes in synaptic\nplasticity may importantly contribute to the experience-\ndependent plasticity of ocular dominance following mani-\npulation of the visual environment.\nSynaptic Scaling: A Form of Homeostatic\nPlasticity\nTheoretically, without additional stabilizing mechanisms,\nactivity-dependent forms of plasticity such as LTP and LTD\ncould drive neural circuit activity towards epileptogenic\nexcitation or complete quiescence. Synaptic scaling is\nconsidered a form of homeostatic plasticity that counters\npotentially maladaptive effects of long-term synapse-spe-\ncific\nplasticity\nby\nglobally\naffecting\nthe\ntransmission\nthrough all synapses on a given neuron (Turrigiano and\nNelson, 2004). In terms of its basic properties and under-\nlying mechanisms, this form of synaptic plasticity contrasts\ndramatically with the forms of LTP and LTD we have\ndiscussed thus far.\nSynaptic scaling occurs when network activity is drama-\ntically decreased or increased for prolonged (4B12\u201324 h)\nperiods of time. Decreased activity (due to blockade of\nsynaptic transmission or spiking) causes an increase in the\nstrength of all excitatory synapses onto excitatory neurons,\nwhereas increased activity (generally induced by partially\nblocking inhibitory synapses) reduces the strength of all\nexcitatory synapses (Turrigiano et al, 1998). Importantly,\nthe relative strengths of individual synpases appear to be\nmaintained even though global synaptic input is signifi-\ncantly altered.\nRelatively little is known about the molecular mechan-\nisms underlying synaptic scaling other than it involves\nchanges in the number of AMPARs (and NMDARs) at\nindividual synapses (Perez-Otano and Ehlers, 2005; Turri-\ngiano and Nelson, 2004; Watt et al, 2000) and likely\npresynaptic changes as well (Burrone and Murthy, 2003;\nBurrone et al, 2002). Recently, evidence has been presented\nsupporting a role for secreted factors in the induction of\nhomeostatic plasticity, suggesting that key triggers for this\nform of plasticity may not be cell autonomous. Specifically,\nsecretion of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis\nfactor-a from glial cells appears to be necessary for the\nincrease in the level of synaptic AMPARs caused by\nextended periods of activity blockade (Beattie et al, 2002;\nStellwagen et al, 2005; Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006). In\naddition, there is evidence suggesting a role for secreted\nBDNF in driving the opposite form of synaptic scaling; the\ndecrease in synaptic strengths caused by extended periods\nof increased network acitivity (Rutherford et al, 1998;\nTurrigiano, 2006).\nFUNCTIONAL ROLES OF LTP AND LTD\nAlthough LTP and LTD are prime candidate mechanisms\nunderlying many different forms of experience-dependent\nplasticity, it is important to remember that they are\nexperimental phenomena used to examine how different\nCa2+\nAMPAR\nPostsynaptic \ncell\nPresynaptic \nterminal\nLTD\nL-type VSCC\nLipid \nprecursor\neCB\nmGluR1/5\nD2R\nCB1R\nPLC\u03b2?\nFigure 3\nModel of eCB-LTD at excitatory synapses onto medium spiny\nneurons in the striatum.

Establishing a causal connection between\na specific form of synaptic plasticity and the behavioral\nconsequences of specific experiences remains a daunting\ntask. Nevertheless, over the last decade, significant advances\nhave been made in connecting synaptic plasticity to a\nnumber of different types of adaptive experience-dependent\nplasticity. Furthermore, it has become increasingly clear\nthat understanding the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity\nmay provide important insights into the pathophysiology of\na variety of neuropsychiatric disorders and also point the\nway toward novel therapeutic approaches. In the following\nsections, we will briefly provide examples that demonstrate\nthat LTP and LTD do occur in vivo in response to\nexperience and may play a causal role in mediating the\nconsequences of experience.\nHippocampal-Dependent Plasticity and Learning\nGiven that LTP was first described in the hippocampus, a\nstructure well established to be critically important for\ndeclarative memory (Squire et al, 2004), it is not surprising\nthat over the last three decades there has been a major effort\naimed at demonstrating a role for hippocampal LTP in\nencoding new memories (Martin et al, 2000; Morris, 2006).\nCorrelations have been observed between defective hippo-\ncampal synaptic plasticity and defective hippocampal-\ndependent memory tasks upon perturbation of a number\nof proteins which function in synaptic plasticity, either\npharmacologically, or through gene knockout (Lynch, 2004;\nMartin et al, 2000; Morris, 2006). For example, rodents in\nwhich NMDAR antagonists were infused into the hippo-\ncampus (Morris and Frey, 1997), as well as mice lacking\nexpression of the NMDAR subunit NR1 in the forebrain\n(Tsien et al, 1996), are defective both in LTP and certain\ntypes of spatial learning. Furthermore, mice in which the\nspecific NMDAR subunit NR2B was overexpressed to\nenhance\nNMDAR\nfunction\nwere\nreported\nto\ndisplay\nenhanced LTP and enhanced spatial learning (Tang et al,\n1999). Recently, more compelling evidence for a role of\nsynaptic plasticity in hippocampal-dependent learning has\nbeen presented. During an inhibitory avoidance task, LTP\ncould be recorded in vivo in a subset of hippocampal CA1\npyramidal cells (Whitlock et al, 2006). This demonstrated\nthat the patterns of activity generated during a real learning\ntask were sufficient to elicit LTP. Perhaps even more\nconvincing was the demonstration that in vivo infusion of a\nPKMz\ninhibitor\ninto\nthe\nhippocampus\nabolished\nthe\nmaintenance of LTP and simultaneously the storage of a\nlong-lasting spatial memory (Pastalkova et al, 2006). These\nfindings strongly suggest that maintained LTP was required\nfor the engram that stored the key spatial information.\nIn addition to its role as a key component of the\nmechanisms underlying the encoding of declarative mem-\nories, hippocampal NMDAR-dependent LTP (as well as\nLTD) may provide important insights into the pathophy-\nsiology and potential treatment of major mental illnesses.\nFor example, a leading hypothesis for the pathophysiology\nof schizophrenia posits a dysfunction in glutamatergic\nsynapses, in particular a hypofunction of NMDARs (Coyle\nand Tsai, 2004; Javitt, 2006; McCullumsmith et al, 2004;\nTamminga, 1998). Thus, understanding the signaling events\ndownstream of NMDAR activation may provide important\ninsights into this devastating disease. A role for dysfunc-\ntions in LTP and/or LTD mechanisms as possible con-\ntributors\nto\nschizophrenia\nis\nalso\nattractive\nin\nthat\nschizophrenia likely involves neurodevelopmental abnorm-\nalities (Lewis and Levitt, 2002) and these phenomena play\nan important role in the early postnatal development of\nneural circuitry (see below). Indeed, genetic variation in\ncalcineurin, which is thought to play an important role in\nNMDAR-dependent LTD, has been associated with schizo-\nphrenia (Gerber et al, 2003).\nAnother example of the potential importance of studying\nLTP and LTD comes from investigation into the therapeutic\nmechanisms of drugs used to treat bipolar disorder. Drugs\nsuch as lithium, valproate, and lamotrigine have been\nreported to have significant effects on the phosphorylation\nof AMPAR subunits and affect their surface expression (Du\net al, 2003, 2004, 2007; Gray et al, 2003). These findings\nsuggest that these drugs may somehow tap into the same\nmechanisms that have evolved to generate LTP and LTD\nand also point to novel approaches for the development of\nnew therapeutic agents that may prove efficacious for\ntreatment of this illness.\nExperience-Dependent Plasticity in the\nDeveloping Sensory Cortex\nSensory receptive fields in the cortex are modified by early\npostnatal\nexperience\nand\nthe\nlink\nbetween\nsynaptic\nplasticity and these forms of experience-dependent plasti-\ncity in sensory systems is becoming increasingly established\n(Foeller and Feldman, 2004; Karmarkar and Dan, 2006;\nMalenka and Bear, 2004). For example, a strong connection\nbetween\nsynaptic\nplasticity\nand\nexperience-dependent\nplasticity has been established in the visual system during\nthe shift in ocular dominance caused by monocular\ndeprivation (MD) (Foeller and Feldman, 2004; Karmarkar\nand Dan, 2006; Malenka and Bear, 2004). MD induces\nbiochemical changes in AMPAR subunits in visual cortex\nthat appear identical to those elicited during NMDAR-\ndependent LTD (Heynen et al, 2003) and visual cortical\nslices obtained from monocularly deprived animals show\ngreatly reduced LTD (Crozier et al, 2007; Heynen et al,\n2003), suggesting that LTD was elicited in vivo. Further-\nmore, in vivo recordings demonstrated that MD caused a\nrapid decrease in the visually evoked potential (VEP) from\nthe deprived eye and a slower enhancement of the VEP from\nthe open eye (Frenkel and Bear, 2004). Importantly,\ncompletely blocking activity in the deprived eye prevented\nthe depression of the VEP demonstrating that this depres-\nsion required retinal activity and, like LTD, was therefore\nactivity-dependent (Frenkel and Bear, 2004).\nSimilar results have been obtained in somatosensory\nbarrel cortex in that sensory deprivation by whisker\ntrimming or plucking causes a weakening of synaptic\nresponses in layer 2/3 cells and an occlusion of LTD (Allen\net al, 2003). This appears to be due to alterations in the\npatterns of pre- and postsynaptic spiking in vivo in a\nmanner that is ideal for generating spike-timing-dependent\nLTD (Celikel et al, 2004). LTP mechanisms, on the other\nhand, appear to be important for the strengthening of\nsynapses in developing barrel cortex due to early postnatal\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n30\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\nexperience. In vivo experience drives recombinant GluR1\ninto barrel cortex synapses in a manner similar to that\nwhich occurs during NMDAR-dependent LTP, whereas\nexpression of a short peptide that inhibits delivery of\nendogenous AMPARs blocks the experience-dependent\nincrease in synaptic strength (Takahashi et al, 2003) as\ndoes a dominant-negative form of the synaptic scaffold\nprotein PSD-95 (Ehrlich and Malinow, 2004). Thus, as\npredicted by theoretical considerations (Bienenstock et al,\n1982; Stent, 1973), LTP and LTD mechanisms appear to be\ncritically involved in early neural circuit development and it\nis not difficult\nto\nimagine how disruption\nin these\nmechanisms might contribute to a host of neurodevelope-\nmental disorders such as autism (Geschwind and Levitt,\n2007; Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003).\nSynaptic Plasticity and Fear Conditioning\nPavlovian fear conditioning is a form of associative memory\nthat depends on the amygdala for its induction and\nmaintenance (Sigurdsson et al, 2007). It occurs when a\nneutral stimulus (such as a tone) is temporally paired with a\nstrong noxious stimulus (such as an electric shock) creating\na memory trace, the consequences of which are that the\nneutral stimulus elicits the learned fear response. Consider-\nable evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that LTP at\nsensory inputs to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala is\nnecessary and perhaps sufficient for establishing this\nengram (Sigurdsson et al, 2007). NMDAR-dependent LTP\ncan be induced at cortical and thalamic inputs into the\nlateral amygdala, both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, fear\nconditioning induces synaptic potentiation at these sy-\nnapses, and this increase in synaptic strength occludes\nfurther induction of LTP (McKernan and Shinnick-Galla-\ngher, 1997; Rogan et al, 1997; Tsvetkov et al, 2002). Like\nNMDAR-dependent LTP in the hippocampus, fear con-\nditioning has also been shown to lead to the insertion of\nnew AMPARs at thalamic input synapses onto lateral\namygdala neurons (Rumpel et al, 2005) and perhaps most\nconvincingly, expression of a peptide that prevents the LTP-\ninduced incorporation of AMPARs at synapses abolished\nacquisition of this form of associative memory (Rumpel\net al, 2005).\nNMDARs in the amgydala are also involved in the\nextinction of learned fear, which can be conceptualized as a\ndifferent form of learning (Myers and Davis, 2002).\nFurthermore, acute treatment with D-cycloserine, a partial\nagonist of NMDARs, enhances the learning processes that\nare responsible for fear extinction via actions in the\namygdala (Walker et al, 2002). On the basis of these\nobservations, clinical trials have been initiated using D-\ncycloserine in combination with behavioral therapy to\nenhance the extinction of fear in phobic patients (Hofmann\net al, 2006; Otto et al, 2007; Ressler et al, 2004). Results to\ndate suggest that the administration of D-cycloserine either\nbefore or shortly after exposure to fearful cues does in fact\nenhance the extinction of the anxiety previously associated\nwith specific cues. Thus, the study of the neural substrates\nof learned fear and its extinction is a compelling example of\nhow research on the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity has\ndirectly led to a potential novel treatment for common\npsychiatric disorders.\nSynaptic Plasticity in Dopamine Circuits\nThe defining characteristic of drug addiction is persistent\nand compulsive seeking and ingestion of drugs despite\nadverse consequences. Over the last decade, a leading\nhypothesis has been that an important neural substrate\nof\naddiction,\nin\nparticular\nrelapse,\nis\nlong-term\nassociative memory processes occurring in several neural\ncircuits\nthat\nreceive\ninput\nfrom\nmidbrain\ndopamine\nneurons (Everitt and Robbins, 2005; Hyman et al, 2006).\nIn other words, it is thought that addictive drugs can usurp\nthe normal adaptive mechanisms underlying reward-based\nlearning.\nThe most well-established key site of action of addictive\ndrugs is the mesolimbic dopamine system consisting of the\nVTA and the NAc. Excitatory synaptic transmission in these\nstructures is critical for mediating several forms of long-\nlasting, drug-induced behavioral plasticity (Everitt and\nWolf, 2002; Hyman and Malenka, 2001). It, therefore, has\nbeen reasonable to hypothesize that plasticity at these\nsynapses plays an important role in mediating some of the\nbehavioral consequences of exposure to drugs of abuse\n(Wolf, 1998).\nIndeed, it is now established that various forms of LTP\nand LTD can be elicited at excitatory synapses in the VTA\nand NAc (Gerdeman et al, 2003; Kauer, 2004; Kelley, 2004;\nThomas and Malenka, 2003). Furthermore, administration\nof a single dose of several different classes of drugs of abuse\ncauses\na significant increase\nin synaptic strength at\nexcitatory synapses onto dopamine cells in the VTA (Faleiro\net al, 2004; Saal et al, 2003; Ungless et al, 2001). This\nincrease shares mechanisms with LTP in the VTA and\nappears to involve upregulation of AMPARs (Ungless et al,\n2001). This drug-induced \u2018LTP\u2019 appears to play a functional\nrole in triggering or mediating some drug-induced beha-\nvioral adaptations, as both conditioned place preference\nand behavioral sensitization are blocked by injection of\nglutamate receptor antagonists into the VTA (Harris and\nAston-Jones, 2003; Vanderschuren and Kalivas, 2000). In\naddition, conditioned place preference, as well as the\nsynaptic potentiation that is observed following cocaine\nadministration, are impaired in GluR1 knockout mice\n(Dong et al, 2004), with the caveat that these mice still\nexhibit robust behavioral sensitization in response to\nrepeated exposure to psychostimulants (Dong et al, 2004;\nVekovischeva et al, 2001).\nWhile drugs of abuse have been observed to induce LTP\nin the VTA, LTD has been observed in the NAc following\nchronic in vivo cocaine administration (Thomas et al,\n2001). Consistent with a functional role for this LTD in\naddiction, injection of glutamate receptor antagonists into\nthe NAc abolishes the expression of behavioral sensitization\n(Kelley, 2004). Furthermore, amphetamine-induced beha-\nvioral sensitization and LTD in the NAc were both abolished\nby injection into the NAc of inhibitors of AMPAR\nendocytosis (Brebner et al, 2005). Interestingly, overexpres-\nsion of GluR1 in the NAc (mimicking an \u2018LTP\u2019-like\ncondition) facilitates the extinction of cocaine-seeking\n(Sutton et al, 2003) and even makes cocaine aversive in a\nconditioned place preference assay (Kelz et al, 1999).\nRecently, it has also been reported that cocaine self-\nadministration abolishes the ability to induce LTD in the\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n31\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\ncore of the NAc after prolonged (21 days) abstinence\n(Martin\net\nal,\n2006)\nand\nin\nvivo\nadministration\nof\ntetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cocaine impairs the gene-\nration of eCB-LTD (Fourgeaud et al, 2004; Mato et al, 2004;\nRobbe et al, 2002b). Thus, drugs of abuse may elicit certain\nforms of synaptic plasticity in specific circuits while\nsimultaneously impairing plasticity in other circuits.\nSynaptic plasticity in the dorsal striatum has also been\ncorrelated with certain learned behaviors, in particular in\nmotor control (Gubellini et al, 2004; Pisani et al, 2005). In\nthis context, it is important to note that two independent\nstriatal circuits are thought to exist, the so-called \u2018direct\u2019\nand \u2018indirect\u2019 pathways, which subserve different functions\nin motor control (Bolam et al, 2000). Indirect pathway\nmedium spiny neurons (MSNs) project to the lateral globus\npallidus and primarily express D2 dopamine receptors while\ndirect pathway MSNs project to the substantia nigra and\nexpress D1 dopamine receptors. As mentioned in the\nsection on eCB-LTD, this form of plasticity is primarily\nrestricted to the indirect pathway MSNs and is absent in\nParkinson\u2019s disease models (Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007).\nHowever,\nin\nslices\nfrom\ndopamine-depleted\nanimals,\nindirect pathway eCB-LTD can be rescued by a D2 receptor\nagonist or pharmacological inhibitors of endocannabinoid\ndegradation. Remarkably, administration of these drugs\ntogether in vivo dramatically reduces Parkinsonian motor\ndeficits suggesting that endocannabinoid-mediated depres-\nsion of indirect pathway synapses has a critical role in\nmotor control and may be a valuable target for therapy of\nstriatal-based brain disorders (Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007).\nThis works also points out the potential power of examining\nthe mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and placing them in\nthe context of the neural circuits in which they are found.\nFuture Directions\nWe have attempted to briefly review the enormous field of\nsynaptic plasticity research in a concise and accessible\nmanner so that by the end of this article, readers will have a\nreasonably up to date knowledge of current thinking about\nthe mechanisms underlying the major forms of synaptic\nplasticity in the mammalian brain and a sense of what their\nin vivo functions might be. By necessity we have had to\nleave out important topics such as how synaptic activity\nmodulates NMDAR-mediated synaptic responses (eg, Mor-\nishita et al, 2005), inhibitory synaptic responses (Chevaleyre\net al, 2006), or the intrinsic excitability of neurons (Xu and\nKang, 2005; Zhang and Linden, 2003), all of which will have\nprofound effects on neural circuit function. Furthermore,\nseveral\ncompelling\nexamples\nthat\ncorrelate\nlong-term\nsynaptic plasticity with experience-dependent modifications\nin behavior have been left out, such as the role of cerebellar\nLTD in motor learning (Boyden et al, 2004; Ito, 2002;\nJorntell and Hansel, 2006).\nThis review should also make clear that while extensive\nprogress has been made, much remains unknown. Even for\nthe most established forms of plasticity, NMDAR-depen-\ndent LTP and LTD in the CA1 region of the hippocampus,\nwe\nstill\nknow\nlittle\nabout\nthe\ndetails\nof\nthe\nsignal\ntransduction pathways triggering these forms of plasticity\nand which specific proteins are being modified to cause the\nchanges in synaptic efficacy. We also know little about the\nmolecular mechanisms underlying the structural changes in\nsynapses that seem to accompany LTP and LTD. With the\naccumulation of evidence demonstrating that long-term\nsynaptic modifications do in fact play important roles in a\nhost of adaptive brain functions, we believe there is strong\njustification to continue efforts toward establishing the\ndetailed molecular basis of the various forms of synaptic\nplasticity. This is particularly important because, as we have\ntried to make clear, such knowledge is likely to have a major\nimpact on our understanding and treatment of a wide range\nof brain disorders.\nWhat direction do we envision the field taking in the near\nfuture? By definition, synaptic plasticity is an electrophy-\nsiological phenomenon. Only by recording synaptic re-\nsponses can the investigator be sure that synaptic function\nhas been modified. Until relatively recently, most electro-\nphysiological studies depended on pharmacological manip-\nulations of proteins, an approach that was aided by the use\nof genetically modified mice. Thus far, gene knockout\nexperiments addressing the function of B200 genes have\nbeen reported and close to 80% of these report effects on\nsynaptic transmission or plasticity (Grant, 2006). With the\ngrowing consensus that NMDAR-dependent LTP is primar-\nily mediated by an increase in postsynaptic AMPARs, while\nLTD is associated with loss of AMPARs from the PSD, there\nalso has been an increased contribution of cell biologists\nwho have focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying\nthe changes in the levels of postsynaptic receptors as well as\nthe changes in synaptic structure that occur. Indeed, a close\ninterdependence has emerged between electrophysiologists\nand cell biologists and this has dramatically impacted the\nfield. Thus, electrophysiologists are increasingly making use\nof tools that enable overexpression, knockdown, and\nmolecular replacement of target proteins both in vitro and\nin vivo (eg, Schluter et al, 2006). These advances are\nenabling a true molecular dissection of the mechanisms\nunderlying plasticity of mammalian brain synapses.\nRecent advances in high-throughput technologies, such as\ngene-chip microarrays for mRNA profiling and advanced\nmass spectrometry for identification of multiple proteins in\na mixed population, have enabled the identification of the\nmolecular components of many biological phenomena and\ncontributed significantly to understanding their regulation.\nFurthermore, the recent advent of \u2018systems biology\u2019 has\ncontributed a number of conceptual advances that enable\nclearer interpretation of the complex interaction networks\nobserved in signal transduction cascades (Alon, 2006).\nThese advances have so far only lightly impacted the field of\nsynaptic plasticity (Pocklington et al, 2006), but we envision\nthat they will have increasing influence in the near future,\ndespite the technical difficulties that are encountered when\ntrying to apply these approaches to the inherently complex\npreparations used in the study of synaptic plasticity.\nWhat might we gain from such studies? A clearer picture\nof the molecules which participate in the processes under-\nlying the different forms of synaptic plasticity, and the\ndynamics of their activation and interactions, would enable\nthe formulation of much more sophisticated models of the\nevents underlying the triggering, expression, and main-\ntenance of specific forms of synaptic plasticity. This in turn\nwould create a strong foundation for focused efforts aimed\nat identifying the central pathways mediating synaptic\nSynaptic plasticity\nA Citri and RC Malenka\n...............................................................................................................................................................\n32\n..............................................................................................................................................\nNeuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS\nREVIEW\nplasticity and assaying their relevance to the phenomenon\nmeasured electrophysiologically.\nBy combining electrophysiological, molecular, cell biolo-\ngical and proteomic approaches, we envision that the next\nfew decades will bring further clarification of the detailed\nmolecular mechanisms underlying the major forms of\nsynaptic plasticity that we have discussed in this review.\nThe use of more sophisticated molecular and genetic\nmanipulations, in particular, the development of mouse\nlines with highly restricted expression of transgenes that\ncan be turned on or off with fine temporal control, will\nsimultaneously facilitate the examination of the neural\ncircuit basis of behavior. Together, we believe these\napproaches will allow sophisticated manipulation of synap-\ntic plasticity mechanisms in highly restricted neural circuits\nand thereby greatly advance our understanding of how\nsynaptic plasticity mediates both adaptive and pathological\nexperience-dependent plasticity. Applying these same ap-\nproaches to disease models should yield new insights into\nthe molecular pathology of diseases of the synapse such as\naddiction, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer\u2019s diseases and also\npave the way toward the development of novel and more\nefficacious treatments.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nRM gratefully acknowledges support from NIMH, NIDA,\nNINDS, and NARSAD.

The \ndeveloping skeleton experiences mechanical loading resulting from embryo movement. We tested the \nhypothesis that environmentally-induced changes in prenatal movement influence embryonic limb \ngrowth to alter proportions. We show that incubation temperature influences motility and limb bone \ngrowth in West African Dwarf crocodiles, producing altered limb proportions which may, influence post-\nhatching performance. Pharmacological immobilisation of embryonic chickens revealed that altered \nmotility, independent of temperature, may underpin this growth regulation. Use of the chick also \nallowed us to merge histological, immunochemical and cell proliferation labelling studies to evaluate \nchanges in growth plate organisation, and unbiased array profiling to identify specific cellular and \ntranscriptional targets of embryo movement. This disclosed that movement alters limb proportions \nand regulates chondrocyte proliferation in only specific growth plates. This selective targeting is related \nto intrinsic mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) pathway activity in individual growth plates. Our \nfindings provide new insights into how environmental factors can be integrated to influence cellular \nactivity in growing bones and ultimately gross limb morphology, to generate phenotypic variation \nduring prenatal development.\nA huge diversity of limb specializations exists in nature. All tetrapods (vertebrates with limbs having digits, ances-\ntrally) possess an equivalent basic limb design, comprising skeletal elements that originate during embryonic \ndevelopment from the three major limb regions (the stylopod, zeugopod and autopod)1. These elements are \ntailored in their proportions to fulfil a range of roles2\u20134, first emerge during prenatal development to characterise \neach species5,6, and also vary to some extent within species7\u201310. It is well established that natural selection has led \nto limb proportions that are adapted to improve locomotor performance in specific environments on an evolu-\ntionary time-scale11\u201314. However, the extent to which these limb proportions are also influenced by shorter-term \nalterations in the environment within the lifetime of a single organism has historically not been as well resolved.\nDramatic evidence has recently emerged which indicates that environmental cues engender profound changes \nin behaviour and musculoskeletal form post-natally. These changes are analogous to adaptive changes inferred \nin evolution and are seen, for example, in the modification of bone shape and limb function necessary for the \nterrestrialization of Polypterus fish15. Morphological changes including alterations in limb/extremity proportions \nhave also been observed in mammals raised in different climates16,17. We speculate that this phenotypic plasticity \nduring prenatal periods of ontogeny could also confer an ability to incorporate shorter-term environmental input \ninto the generation of variation even prior to birth/hatching. Whether such interactions between environmental \ninput and \u2018intrinsic\u2019 aspects of developmental regulation facilitate phenotypic variation in limb morphology dur-\ning prenatal development has not however previously been explored.\nMorphological diversity is observed across locations with divergent climates in a variety of species, such as extinct \ncrocodylomorphs (relatives of extant Crocodylia)18. Inter-specific adaptation for smaller surface area to body size \nratios in cooler climates (\u201cAllen\u2019s rule\u201d), often achieved through reductions in limb length, is also widespread16,19. \nIntriguingly, intra-species variation in limb form in individuals from thermally divergent locations has also \n1Comparative Biomedical Sciences, the Royal Veterinary College, London, NW1 0TU, UK. 2Genetics and Molecular \nMedicine, King\u2019s College London, London, WC2R 2LS, UK. 3Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska \nUniversity Hospital, 14186, Stockholm, Sweden.

Phenotypic differences seen in the North American lizard \nSceloporus occidentalis include longer limbs relative to body size in individuals from warmer locations, and a \nreduction in relative limb length in cooler, more northern populations. Like many reptilian species, Sceloporus \nis not incubated by a parent and its incubation conditions are determined by the environment. Incubation tem-\nperature has previously been shown to influence embryonic motility and skeletal growth in chickens20. Changes \nin embryonic limb bone growth induced by pharmacologically stimulating embryo motility alone suggest that \nmechanical input, rather than temperature per se, regulates skeletal growth in embryonic limbs21\u201325.\nHerein, we explore the hypothesis that developmental plasticity during prenatal stages of ontogeny allows for \nvariation in limb proportions to emerge via environmentally-triggered alterations in movement. This hypothesis \nwas tested in experiments using embryonic crocodiles (Osteolaemus tetraspis Cope 1861) and chickens (Gallus \ngallus). Previous studies in embryonic chickens indicate that altered incubation temperature modulates motil-\nity and limb growth20. This species uses contact incubation by a parent, however, and many birds alter their \nbehaviours in different climates to maintain relatively constant incubation temperatures. Incubation at different \ntemperatures within chickens is thus less likely to occur naturally26,27. Use of crocodiles, which are ectothermic, \noviparous and not directly incubated by a parent, in contrast, provide an opportunity to explore whether motility \nand limb proportions are modified by incubation temperature in a model where such thermal variation could \noccur naturally. We specifically tested whether West African Dwarf crocodile embryos incubated at the extremes \nof the normal range for this species (32\u2009\u00b0C and 28\u2009\u00b0C) exhibited alterations in motility and limb proportions; we \ntherefore made measurements of body size, limb length and stylopod, zeugopod and autopod element length. \nThe relatively small number of eggs produced in a single Osteolaemus clutch limited our experiment to a single \ntime-point, and did not allow for optimization of pharmacological manipulation of embryo movement in this \nspecies to separate the effects of temperature and embryo motility on limb growth.\nEmbryonic chickens, a commonly used model for mechanistic studies in limb development in which methods \nfor pharmacological alteration of motility are well established and for which species-specific reagents are read-\nily available27\u201329, were used to further explore our hypothesis. Specifically, we tested whether pharmacological \nimmobilization alone alters limb proportions, when temperature is maintained constant to remove any influence \nit may have on embryo movement as a variable. Accordingly, limb element lengths were measured at selected \ntime-points during development and their growth monitored in some experiments by repeat MRI imaging of \nindividual control and immobilised chicken embryos to examine whether pharmacologically-induced alterations \nin movement alone produced modifications in limb proportions.\nDuring early limb development, individual skeletal elements are laid down as cartilage condensations. Limb \nproportions emerge as a result of the size of the initial condensation28 and primarily due to later changes in their \ngrowth by endochondral ossification5, the process by which limb skeletal elements grow longitudinally29. Each \nelement forms initially as a cartilage model that elongates via a controlled process of chondrocyte proliferation, \nmaturation and hypertrophy before replacement by bone during ossification30\u201332. Muscle contraction has been \nimplicated as a regulator of embryonic long bone growth by endochondral ossification25,33\u201336, but the molecular \nand cellular targets of such regulation have not been fully characterised. Use of the embryonic chick as a model \nallowed us to identify the mechanisms which underpin regulation of limb proportions by embryonic move-\nment by examining the impact of altered embryo movement on both cellular behaviour and gene expression in \nindividual growth plates. Measurements of growth plate zones widths, the expression of proliferative markers \nin the growth plate were made, and the size of hypertrophic chondrocytes from control and immobilised limbs \nwas used to investigate the primary effect of embryo immobilisation on longitudinal growth. Unbiased array \nprofiling was then used to evaluate gene expression in control and immobilised femur and tibiotarsus growth \nplates at selected time points during development. Using an inducible method for embryo immobilisation along \nwith longitudinal tracking of limb growth has allowed us to investigate, and separate, changes in gene expression \nwhich are associated with determining the capacity of a growth plate cartilage to respond, sense and coordinate \na subsequent growth response to mechanical cues. Our findings provide evidence that environmental factors, \nand not only genetic pre-specification may differentially influence limb element growth during prenatal develop-\nment and thereby introduce phenotypic variation, which provides a novel insight into the potential evolutionary \nimportance of developmental plasticity.\nResults\nTemperature influences embryonic crocodile limb proportions.\u2003\nWe investigated whether temper-\nature alters motility and limb growth in the West African Dwarf crocodile. Embryos were incubated at 28\u2009\u00b0C \nand 32\u2009\u00b0C from embryonic day (E) 10\u201370. Embryo motility was monitored at E44, 48, 51 and 55. Snout-vent \nlength, total limb length and total limb and limb element lengths corrected against body size were measured from \nembryos euthanised at E70. Embryos incubated at 28\u2009\u00b0C were less motile when monitored at stage E51, close \nto mid-gestation (88% decrease in frequency of movement, P\u2009<\u200b\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a01). The relatively heightened activity \nof embryos incubated at 32\u2009\u00b0C persisted up until E55, when their large body size may have restricted in ovo \nmovement.\nTotal body size at E70, around hatching age, was significantly smaller in embryos incubated at lower temper-\natures (38% smaller P\u2009<\u200b\u20090.05). Staging of embryos according to Ferguson\u2019s37 staging series revealed that embryos \nincubated at 28\u2009\u00b0C corresponded to stage 27 and E60\u201363, while those incubated at 32\u2009\u00b0C corresponded to stage \n28, which corresponds to E64\u201370 (with E70 considered hatching age). Staging at these late developmental stages \nis not based on morphological parameters but rather relative absorption of the yolk sac. A reduction in overall \nlimb length was also observed (38% shorter snout-to-vent length and 44% reduction of limb length, P\u2009<\u200b\u20090.001 and \n0.0001). Critically, the lower incubation temperature did not generate a uniform deficit in growth, where all ele-\nments might be expected to be affected equally, but rather disproportionately affected the length of specific skel-\netal elements over others, to change relative limb proportions. The hindlimbs in less motile embryos incubated at \nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n3\nScientific REPOrTS | 7:41926 | DOI: 10.1038/srep41926\n28\u2009\u00b0C were shorter when corrected for overall body size (10%, P\u2009<\u200b\u20090.05) and exhibited disproportionately shorter \ntibiae (11%, P\u2009<\u200b\u20090.05) but longer digits (9%, P\u2009<\u200b\u20090.05) compared to incubation at 32\u2009\u00b0C. Examination at euthanasia \nrevealed that all embryos were female, which rules out the possibility of sexual dimorphism in growth between \ntemperature groups.\nEmbryo movement is responsible for altered limb proportions.\u2003\nOur data from crocodile embryos \nindicate that some limb regions may be more severely affected than others, but did not establish whether this \nreflected temperature per se or altered movement. Chicken embryos were used for immobilisation studies, during \nwhich embryo movement was altered pharmacologically while constant 37\u2009\u00b0C incubation temperature was main-\ntained. Total limb and individual limb element lengths were measured in chicks immobilised between E10\u201314, \n13\u201317 and 15\u201318 and compared to controls. Additionally, total limb and limb element lengths were measured \nin embryos immobilised from E10 onwards by daily MRI imaging between E14\u201318. Despite the onset of overt \nmovement from E4.5 in the chick embryo, and \u201ccoordinated\u201d movement from E7 onwards38, micro-CT-based \nmeasurements showed that total limb growth was unchanged by immobility imposed between E10\u201314.\nPelvic limb length was reduced by the absence of movement only at later time points, between E13\u201316 and \nE15\u201318 (by 22% and 12% vs. vehicle-treated control, P\u2009<\u200b\u20090.001 and\u2009<\u200b\u20090.05 respectively; Fig.\u00a02).

The TMT was most affected \nby immobilization between E15\u201318 (16% shorter compared to 12% in the TBT, P\u2009<\u200b\u20090.05), whereas in contrast the \nfemur was not significantly reduced at this late time point.\nMRI allows for non-invasive, longitudinal monitoring of chick development39,40. We used daily MRI scans to \nachieve repeat measures of limb growth between E14 to E18 in individual chicks immobilized from E10. These \nmeasures of limb and skeletal element length confirmed the existence of a period between E10\u201313 when lack of \nmotility does not modify chick limb growth (see Fig.\u00a02). Immobilisation between E15\u201318 achieved reductions in \nlimb length without modification in eye diameter (a gross index of chick skull development41; note that HH-based \nstaging after E13 relies on beak and 3rd digit lengths which are both affected by immobilization. Such staging was \nthus not appropriate). We therefore staged only control chick embryos upon euthanasia after the final scan at E18 \nto assess whether cooling of eggs during MR imaging had an impact on development. Measurements of beak and \n3rd digit lengths from these chick embryos corresponded to those of E16 embryos42, indicating that these methods \nintroduce a level of developmental delay. The altered limb proportions seen in MR-imaged embryos do however \ncorrespond closely with measurements made using microCT at E17; their altered limb proportions are consistent \nwith selective modification of longitudinal growth by embryo movement.\nLongitudinal MRI scans were used to explore the differing effects of chick immobilisation seen in individual \nlimb elements at E13\u201317 and E15\u201318, and revealed that modifications in growth of each element in response \nto altered movement first emerge at different stages in each element. Longitudinal growth of the TBT showed \nsignificant reliance on movement only after E17, and the femur prior to E17, whereas TMT length was markedly \nmodified by E15 (Fig.\u00a03). Together these data indicate that different elements exhibit differential sensitivity to the \nremoval of normal chick motility, which is seemingly unrelated to the proximo-distal sequence of limb element \nemergence.\nGrowth plate dynamics are influenced by embryo movement.\u2003\nWe next sought to relate the \nimmobilisation-induced changes in limb proportions to modifications in the dynamics of specific growth \nplates. We quantified the widths of the distinct growth plate zones (proliferative/maturing, pre-hypertrophic \nand hypertrophic) in proximal and distal ends of the femur, TBT and TMT in sections from control and \nFigure 2.\u2002 Total hindlimb length is reduced by removal of embryo movement at selected time-points during \ndevelopment.

Zone width was expressed as a percentage of the total \ngrowth plate width. Immobilization altered growth plate dynamics selectively in the distal region of both the \nfemur and TMT, but not TBT, at E18 (Fig.\u00a04). In contrast, the proximal regions of all elements were unaffected. \nEach growth plate in a given element does not contribute equally to longitudinal growth, and the changes we \nobserved were targeted to the growth plate deemed responsible for >\u200b50% longitudinal growth43. No signifi-\ncant impact on either TBT growth plate was observed. Thus, differences in sensitivity to external input may be \nintrinsic to different limb regions.\nThe impact of chick immobility in the affected growth plates at E18 was characterised by a relative expansion \nin the proliferative/maturing zone, with a corresponding narrowing of the pre-hypertrophic zone in femur and \nTMT (Fig.\u00a05). We observed no impact of immobilization in any growth plate at E14 (Fig.\u00a04f). These data suggest a \ncorrelation between modified growth plate dynamics and the changes in longitudinal growth of specific elements \nand limb proportions observed in immobilized chicks.\nMovement drives cellular progression in the growth plate.\u2003\nWe tested the hypothesis that there is a \ncorrelation between chick embryo motility and changes in growth plate dynamics by examining cellular behav-\niour in the growth plate in response to immobilisation. We examined the regulation of chondrocyte proliferation, \napoptosis and hypertrophy in the distal femoral growth plate of chicks immobilized from E10 onwards in com-\nparison with control chick embryos. We compared the distribution of cells positive for proliferating cell nuclear \nantigen (PCNA, an S-phase marker) and phosphohistone H3 (a marker of mitosis), expressed as a percentage of \nthe total number of cells (DAPI labelled).\nImmobility from E10 produced a loss of PCNA labelling at the articular surface, little change in the prolifer-\native zone and an increase in the number of PCNA positive cells in the prehypertrophic/hypertrophic zone, thus \nwidening the region of PCNA labelling (normally restricted to the proliferative zone) by E14 (Fig.\u00a05a\u2013e). This \nwas accompanied by a diminution in the number of phosphohistone H3-positive cells (Fig.\u00a05f\u2013j), indicating that \nFigure 3.\u2002 Limb proportions are altered by immobilization of embryonic chicks at selected time-points \nduring development.

These changes were observed at E14, before any measurable impact of motil-\nity on femur length was evident, and were still apparent at E18 (see Supplementary\u00a0Fig.\u00a0S1).\nTracking of proliferating cells by BrdU incorporation in E16 chick limbs, 6 days after the onset of immobiliza-\ntion, confirmed that immobilisation slowed cellular progression through the growth plate; BrdU-positive cells in \nnormal limbs had progressed to the prehypertrophic zone within 4\u2009hours of BrdU administration, but were largely \nrestricted to the proliferating zone in immobilised limbs (Fig.\u00a05k\u2013o). The rate of uptake of BrdU (cells per hour) \nwas unchanged with immobilisation, suggesting that proliferative arrest in these cells occurs after completion of \nS-phase but prior to mitosis (Supplementary\u00a0Fig.\u00a0S2).\nWe found no alteration in number or distribution of TUNEL-positive cells in control and immobilized chick \nlimbs at any time-point (Supplementary\u00a0Fig.\u00a0S3), indicating no impact on apoptosis. Measurement of chon-\ndrocyte cell area in regions of the hypertrophic zone adjacent to the chondro-osseous junction also showed no \nmodification in hypertrophic expansion after 4 days of immobilization at E14. However, chondrocyte size was \nreduced by more prolonged lack of movement at E18 (21% reduction, P\u2009<\u200b\u20090.05, see Supplementary\u00a0Fig.\u00a0S4). These \ndata indicate that movement initially targets specific growth plates by driving completion of the cell cycle within \nthe proliferative zone.\nMolecular features of the growth response to mechanics.\u2003\nOur data suggest that longitudinal growth \nof embryonic limb elements is initially intrinsically regulated; \u201cmechano-sensitive\u201d limb growth is not always a \nfeature of ontogeny but is acquired relatively late in development. Our data also suggest that, in the embryonic \nchicken, limb growth becomes responsive to altered embryo movement between E13\u201315 in the femur, but growth \nof the TBT is affected less severely by mechanics, and not until later time-points. This was exploited in an attempt \nto identify the molecular factors responsible for mechanical regulation of cartilage growth. Transcriptional profil-\ning was performed to identify changes in coordinated gene expression associated with the switch from intrinsic to \nmechanical regulation of cartilage growth. Transcriptional profiles were compared in the distal femur and prox-\nimal TBT growth plates of control chicks at E12, 13 and 15 to explore whether changes in gene expression occur \nduring the time period when femur growth becomes sensitive to movement but the growth of the TBT does not. \nAdditionally, gene expression was compared in the distal femur and proximal TBT of chicks immobilised between \nE10\u201315 and compared to E15 controls, to explore whether any genes identified by the previous comparison were \nalso regulated in expression by embryo movement.\nA comparison of control femur and TBT limb elements at E12 and E13 did not reveal any differentially \nexpressed genes or pathways between these limb elements. Gene expression in pooled TBT and femur elements \nat E12 and E13 (to maximise statistical power) revealed a small number of modestly differentially expressed \ngenes between the two time-points, 4 of which, namely Scube2, BTF3L4 and indirectly HMBG3 (via HMBG2) \nand IGF2BP3 (via links with IFG2), have known associations with endochondral ossification (Table\u00a01). However, \ngene ontology (GO) analysis of these genes revealed enrichment of no distinct pathways or cellular components, \nsuggesting this was a stochastic observation. Differences in expression specific to individual limb regions did, \nhowever, emerge by E15; 58 genes (4 upregulated and 54 downregulated) were found to differ in expression in \nthe femur relative to the TBT at this time-point, and belong to specific biological pathways. GO analysis revealed \nenrichment of genes associated with Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signalling among those down-\nregulated specifically in the femur at E15 (Fig.\u00a06a,b). The mTOR complex has diverse roles in the regulation of cell \nproliferation and growth and in our analysis appears to be the primary pathway altered between the femur and \nTBT elements at E15, suggesting it may regulate the emergence of limb proportions by specifically modulating the \ngrowth of those elements sensitive to movement.\nWe further sought to identify whether the genes which are associated with the acquisition of \n\u201cmechano-responsive\u201d cartilage growth are also involved in the mechano-sensory process, and in coordinating \nthe growth response to mechanical stimuli. We compared gene expression in the femur and TBT elements in \ncontrol and DMB-treated limbs at E15. The mTOR associated genes identified by the previous comparison were \nnot significantly altered in their expression in either the femur or TBT in response to drug-induced immobilisa-\ntion. In contrast, we found that a number of traditionally \u2018myogenic\u2019 genes associated with MEF2c were down-\nregulated in both the femur and TBT in response to immobilisation (Fig.\u00a07a). These genes are associated with \nactin-mediated cell contraction and have previously been implicated in the mechano-transduction process during \nembryonic limb growth44. However, although the skeletal muscle genes downregulated in response to immobi-\nlisation were very similar between limb elements, a number of genes associated with the regulation of chondro-\ngenesis were altered in expression in the femur but not the TBT. Upstream analysis, which statistically links a \ncombined pattern of up/down regulated set of RNAs with pre-existing signatures of drug or protein induced tran-\nscriptional responses45,46, identified that these changes are consistent with increased Wnt3a activity in the femur \nin response to immobilisation (Figs\u00a05 and 7b,c). Our data suggest that genes associated with actin-mediated cell \ncontraction are regulated in chondrocytes by embryo movement and may, as previously suggested44, contribute \nto sensing and transducing mechanical signals. Our data also suggest that Wnt3a is involved in coordinating \nchondrocyte responses to embryo movement in growth plate cartilage. However, such regulation of growth by \nmovement only occurs in limb elements which have lower intrinsic mTOR pathway activity. Our analysis did not \nreveal which effectors of mTOR were responsible for the differences in intrinsic activity.\nDiscussion\nOur data provide evidence to support the hypothesis that the environment influences developmental pathways \nto produce phenotypic variation in limb form during embryonic development. Altered embryo behaviour and \ngrowth in response to incubation temperature in West African Dwarf crocodiles results in the emergence of \nhindlimb proportions that may, in turn, influence locomotor performance upon hatching, as well as survival in \nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n9\nScientific REPOrTS | 7:41926 | DOI: 10.1038/srep41926\nvarying environments9,12,47. There are unfortunately no studies describing adaptive differences in extant crocodil-\nian morphology to warmer or cooler environments. Nonetheless, similar correlation between limb length relative \nto body size and latitude (which is strongly linked to climate) has been observed in extant lizards7, suggesting \nthat there is scope for such adaptive prenatal changes to occur in ectothermic, oviparous species. We observed \nthat hind limbs in less motile embryos incubated at 28\u2009\u00b0C were shorter when corrected for overall body size, with \nrelatively shorter tibiae but longer digits compared to those incubated at 32\u2009\u00b0C. Extant crocodilian embryos have \nbeen shown to scale limb proportions isometrically with body size after the very earliest stages of development, \nwith negative allometry in the zeugopod (ulna) and positive allometry of the forelimb autopod providing the \nexceptions to this general isometric scaling48. A study which quantified the contribution of the femur, tibia and \n3rd metatarsal to total limb length (digits were excluded) in Alligator mississippiensis from 8 days into incubation \nuntil hatching age (~70 days) showed that throughout prenatal ontogeny, the femur consistently contributes 43%, \ntibia 36% and 3rd metatarsal 21% to limb length, suggesting that their proportions do not to change39. Applying \nthese methods of comparison to our data, we find that the values calculated from Osteolaemus embryos incubated \nat 32\u2009\u00b0C are similar, with the femur contributing 40\u2009\u00b1\u200b\u20090.3%, tibia 39\u2009\u00b1\u200b\u20090.7% and metatarsal 21\u2009\u00b1\u200b\u20090.8% to total limb \nlength. There are some differences in the values calculated from embryos incubated at 28\u2009\u00b0C, in which the femur \ncontributes 41\u2009\u00b1\u200b\u20091.1%, tibia 34\u2009\u00b1\u200b\u20090.9% and metatarsal 24\u2009\u00b1\u200b\u20090.9%. It remains to be established whether all autopod \nelements adhere to such isometric scaling during Osteolaemus ontogeny, but we speculate that it is unlikely that \nthe differences observed in the relative length of the digits between embryos incubated at 28\u2009\u00b0C and 32\u2009\u00b0C can be \nexplained solely on the basis that development is delayed.\nThe number of crocodile embryos available limited our study to a single time-point. To date, most studies into \nthe embryonic development and limb scaling of crocodilians have focused on Alligator mississippiensis, likely \ndue to their availability. Further studies to monitor limb growth throughout prenatal ontogeny in other species \nlike Osteolaemus are required to fully understand how incubation temperature influences limb scaling in other \ncrocodilians. However, the trend for isometric scaling of hindlimb proportions in Alligator suggests that the \nshorter tibiae and longer digits of Osteolaemus incubated at relatively cool temperatures may be due to differential \nregulation of limb growth at this temperature.\nThe observed reduction in hindlimb length relative to body size, and the proportional shortening of zeugopod \nand lengthening of autopod elements in crocodile embryos incubated at low temperatures, could be extrapolated \nto produce more \u201cpaddle-like\u201d limbs in an extreme case. This has remarkable correspondence to limb adaptations \nto more aquatic environments observed in extinct crocodylomorphs (e.g. those adapted to more aquatic environ-\nments such as thalattosuchians show a trend for reduced zeugopod elements, including ulna, tibia and fibula49). \nThe fossil record indicates that climate may have driven phenotypic diversity in crocodilian-line archosaurs, \nwith less diverse, more terrestrial adaptations occurring at latitudes closer to the equator, while a greater range of \ndiversity was associated with higher latitudes18. Correlation between morphology (i.e. limb length) and latitude/\nclimate has also been reported in other reptiles and is reminiscent of Allen\u2019s rule in mammals7,8,50. Direct regula-\ntion of cartilage growth by temperature has recently been proposed as a potentially comprehensive explanation \nfor reduced extremity length and altered limb proportions in cooler climates51.

Although absolute growth of all elements was reduced at the lower \n28\u2009\u00b0C incubation temperature and a proportional reduction was seen in zeugopod length, the most peripheral \nautopod elements, which we would expect to be most severely \u2018shortened\u2019 by temperature regulation of cartilage \ngrowth, are instead proportionally elongated, rather than shortened. We suggest that mechanical regulation of \nembryonic bone growth also contributes to the variation in limb form seen in different climates by differentially \nregulating the growth of individual limb regions.\nPharmacological immobilization of embryonic chickens revealed that modulation in pelvic limb growth can \nbe achieved by alteration of embryo motility alone, independent of incubation temperature. Our data suggest \nthat this can be achieved via selective targeting of chondrocyte proliferation and progression in specific growth \nplates by embryo movement, to achieve changes in limb proportions. Our findings suggest that embryo motil-\nity acts to regulate limb proportions by exerting a differential impact on the growth of individual limb regions. \nThis supports the findings of previous studies which showed that the impact of immobilisation on the growth of \nembryonic limb elements is complex, differs in individual limb regions and is partially dependent on the day at \nwhich immobilisation commences23,24,35,36,52\u201354. Previous studies by Lamb, et al.36 and Heywood, et al.21 which also \nreported an impact on limb length at E14 or later are consistent with this view. In contrast, Hosseini and Hogg23 \nreported an impact on femur and TBT/tibia length from E11 but did not observe any alteration in growth carti-\nlage volume until 3 days later, at E14. Germiller and Goldstein55, on the other hand, showed an impact on element \nlength and proliferation, without any changes in growth plate zone widths later than E11, from E13 onwards. Our \nuse of 5\u03bc\u200bm resolution microCT to make measurements of element length found a significant impact of embryo \nmovement only after E14. Despite examining limb growth in response to immobilisation across a very extensive \nperiod spanning E8\u2013E20, these studies together appear to identify a comparatively short developmental period \n(potentially from E11 to E14) when sensitivity to movement commences. This variation may reflect inaccuracies \nintroduced by the different methods used for measuring limb length, variation in the incubation temperature \nmaintained between studies, the difficulty of accurately staging immobilised embryos (to allow for consistency) \nor even variation in growth rate between strains of domestic chicken used.\nWe observed that in limb elements which are not growing rapidly (e.g. the chicken femur between E15\u201318, \nFig.\u00a03), there is little scope to alter growth in response to immobilization. However, the differential impact of \nmovement on each limb region cannot be fully explained by the region\u2019s growth rate alone; e.g. the length of the \nTMT in chicks is severely affected by immobilization, even at developmental stages when other elements are \ngrowing more rapidly. Furthermore, our data suggest that \u201cmechano-responsiveness\u201d of longitudinal limb growth \nis not always a feature of ontogeny but is acquired during development. Our longitudinal data gathered from \nMRI analysis support the notion that different limb elements acquire mechanically-driven plasticity in growth \nat different stages. The developmental delay introduced by our imaging protocol means that we cannot ascertain \nexactly when mechano-sensitive growth is likely acquired in each limb element during normal chick develop-\nment, but it certainly seems to differ within each of the individual stylopod, zeugopod and autopod limb regions. \nThis developmental delay was ascertained by staging of control embryos after 4 days of MRI imaging, at E18, \naccording to the Hamburger and Hamilton staging series42. Staging of DMB-treated embryos using this method \nwas not possible as the growth of the traditional anatomical landmarks upon which the grading of late stages is \nbased (beak and 3rd digit length) is influenced by embryo immobilisation. However, we observed no difference \nin eye diameter (chosen as a gross index of skull development, as previous studies have identified that the growth \nof craniofacial bones is not influenced by embryo paralysis54) between control and immobilised embryos, which \nsuggests that embryo paralysis does not cause an overall developmental delay but rather influences the growth of \nselected musculoskeletal elements. Investigating the impact of immobility on chick growth plate dynamics con-\nfirmed an impact of altered movement in the distal femur and TMT, but not in either TBT growth plate by E14, \nsuggesting that differences in responsiveness to mechanical stimuli are instead intrinsic to different limb regions. \nThe impact of altered motility on each individual element, however, differs between the chicken and crocodile \nspecies considered in this study.\nOur analysis identified a population of cells in the proliferative zone of specific growth plates which progress \nslowly through the cell cycle in the absence of movement, and that cell cycle progression is accelerated to com-\nplete mitosis, and later differentiate, upon embryonic limb movement. A deficit in hypertrophic expansion, which \nappears to be secondary to the impact on proliferation, is also observed in the absence of normal mechanical \ninput. The IGF-1-dependent phase of hypertrophy in particular is known to underpin the differential growth of \nlimb elements in species which exhibit dramatic differences in limb proportions56; our data highlight that this \nmay also be subject to regulation by movement depending on the intrinsic level of activation of canonical growth \nregulating pathways.\nTranscriptional profiling by microarray analysis offers an explanation for why the growth of some elements \nis more severely affected by embryo immobilisation than others at the time-points chosen for this study. The \ninducible nature of pharmacological immobilisation of embryonic chicks, coupled with longitudinal monitoring \nof limb growth, allowed us to identify factors that determine whether a limb element is capable of responding \nto mechanics during prenatal growth. Previous embryo immobilisation studies have identified genes potentially \ninvolved in mechano-sensation and transduction and the response of embryonic limb growth to paralysis44. It \nwas not possible in this study to separate the influence of spontaneous neuronal activity on gene expression from \nthe consequent muscle activity that it stimulates. There are compounds which may be used to increase the fre-\nquency of embryonic movement, such as 4-aminopyridine, but these also provoke actions at the neuromuscular \njunction. However, the cytoskeleton-associated genes which we found to be altered in expression in immobilised \nlimbs (Fig.\u00a07a) have previously been implicated in chondrocyte mechano-transduction in vitro57,58, suggesting \nthat this response at least is not dependent upon neuronal activity. Perhaps with the advent of newer methods for \nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n13\nScientific REPOrTS | 7:41926 | DOI: 10.1038/srep41926\nnon-invasive imaging and monitoring of embryo movement in ovo39,59,60 it will be possible to better distinguish \nthe contributions from muscle-induced mechanical stimuli from those induced by spontaneous neuronal activity.\nOur analysis suggests that mechano-sensation and the growth response to mechanical stimuli can be \nde-coupled, and that additional factors exist which determine whether a growth response to mechanical stimuli \nwill occur in individual limb regions. One such factor appears, on the basis of our transcriptional profiling of \nthese elements, to be the intrinsic degree of mTOR pathway related activity.mTOR is a known regulator of the \ncell cycle and forms two multi-protein complexes known as mTORC1 and mTORC2, which perform different \nfunctions (Rokutanda, Fujita et al. 2009, Guan, Yang et al. 2014). mTORC1 is known to regulate protein syn-\nthesis in response to intrinsic factors such as nutrient and growth factor availability (Chen and Long 2014). \nThe function of mTORC2 is less well characterised, but is also thought to regulate cellular metabolism through \nactivation of Akt/PKB, and may play a role in cell adhesion or cytoskeletal organisation due to its stimulation of \ncytoskeletal-associated genes including paxillin and F-actin (Chen, Holguin et al. 2015). These complexes there-\nfore function to integrate aspects of energy metabolism with the translation of mRNA during cell division. mTOR \nhas previously been implicated as a regulator of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation; the Akt-mTOR \npathway positively regulates chondrocyte proliferation, maturation, matrix production and growth during skel-\netal development (Rokutanda, Fujita et al. 2009). There are, however, conflicting reports on the role of mTORC \nin the growth plate, with some studies reporting that inhibition of mTORC results in impaired chondrocyte \nproliferation, while others report only an impact on hypertrophy (Yang, Yang et al. 2013, Guan, Yang et al. 2014). \nThese differences may reflect the relative impact on mTORC1 and mTORC2 signalling following mTOR inhibi-\ntion. In our analysis, evidence for significantly lower mTOR pathway activity in the femur but not the TBT at E15 \ncoincides with our findings showing onset of mechanosensitive growth in the femur only. These analyses also \nreveal a lack of any significant modification in transcriptional signature across E12 and E13 in the TBT and femur, \nsuggesting that no marked change in their behaviour is likely to have occurred during this earlier timeframe. \nWe propose that reduced mTOR-stimulated growth, likely to occur in response to other intrinsic factors such as \nnutrient availability, confers the ability for cells to be influenced by external, mechanical cues.\nActivation of mTOR itself has also been shown by previous studies to be regulated by mechanical stimuli. \nIts activation is stimulated by cyclic loading in primary growth plate chondrocytes, and has been shown to be \nreduced in growth cartilage of pharmacologically immobilised chicks at E17 and in cases of postnatal limb immo-\nbilisation in humans52,61,62. However, while mTOR activation status appeared lower in the control femur relative to \nTBT at E15, the expression of genes associated with the mTOR pathway were not altered by immobilisation at E15 \nin our study; i.e. the difference between E15 femur and TBT was intrinsic to the femur and appears insensitive to \ngross changes in movement. This suggests that mTOR is likely not directly responsible for mechano-responsive \ngrowth. Rather, reduction in its activation in the femur may instead allow the influence of other factors, such as \nmovement, to impact on growth. This is consistent with our observed changes in the expression of cytoskeletal \ngenes associated with actin-mediated cell contraction with immobilisation in both TBT and femur, which previ-\nous studies have identified as a potential mediator in \u2018sensing\u2019 or transducing altered mechanical stimuli44. Our \nexamination of changes in gene expression by immobilisation are also consistent with previous studies44 in that \nthey suggest that the growth response to immobilisation is likely coordinated via Wnt3a activity. Indeed, these \nWnt-related changes in expression occur in only the femur with immobilisation, consistent with Wnt\u2019s proposed \nfunction in coordinating the growth response to embryo movement.\nThus, differential intrinsic mTOR activity in individual growth plates appears to help determine whether \ngrowth responds to external mechanical cues or is regulated only by intrinsic factors such as amino acid availabil-\nity and growth factors. mTOR\u2019s known regulation of protein synthesis during the cell cycle points to its potential \nto impact events in the growth plate proliferative zone. Our exploration of immobilisation-induced changes in \nthe proliferative zone suggest that chondrocytes are arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, which involves \nrapid protein synthesis in preparation for mitosis. Our observation that proliferative zone chondrocytes in the \nfemur reach S phase at a normal rate (they incorporate BrdU during DNA replication) but fail to, or take longer \nto undergo mitosis strengthens this connection. We therefore propose that developmental downregulation of \nintrinsic mTOR activity results in reduced growth in the absence of embryo movement, and appears to allow the \ncapacity for mechanical stimuli to instead drive cell cycle progression in the proliferative zone. Previous studies \nindicate that selection for intrinsic growth regulation can indeed occur at the expense of adaptability to mechan-\nical loading63,64, although it is currently not clear how mTOR signalling would interact with Wnt3a mediation of \nthe growth response (this need not be a direct interaction). Selection for different levels of intrinsic mTOR activity \nmay offer an explanation for why different elements are more susceptible to growth regulation by mechanical \nstimuli in different species, such as the chicken and crocodile considered in this study.\nIn mammals, and to a lesser extent birds, the embryonic environment is controlled by a parent and, in the \nabsence of pharmacological intervention or pathology, this appears to secure an optimal range of embryo motility \nto produce suitable limb forms, although at a major metabolic cost to the mother65. Many ectothermic oviparous \nspecies adopt a different reproductive strategy by producing larger numbers of eggs that are not incubated by a \nparent66. The incubation conditions of these eggs are dependent upon the environment and a single animal may \nproduce multiple clutches of eggs in a season, and/or bury a single clutch of eggs in a nest containing a temper-\nature gradient67, thereby increasing the chance that at least some embryos will experience \u2018optimal\u2019 incubation \nconditions. However, our data suggest that the reproductive strategy of these animals does not rely entirely on \nchance, but that developmental plasticity during the embryonic phase may also engender a robust capacity for \nthe embryos of reptiles such as crocodiles (and perhaps other tetrapod species) to adapt their limb proportions \nin ways that may be beneficial in their post-hatching environment. Our findings also suggest that regulation of \nprenatal growth in response to embryo motility is achieved by the control of proliferation in limb growth plates \nwhich are specified by a mechanism involving intrinsic reduction in mTOR pathway activation.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n14\nScientific REPOrTS | 7:41926 | DOI: 10.1038/srep41926\nMaterials and Methods\nManipulation of embryo movement.\u2003\nAll procedures complied with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) \nAct 1986 and were approved by the RVC animal welfare and ethical review body.\nCrocodiles.\u2003 Crocodile (Osteolaemus tetraspis) eggs from a single clutch were obtained from Crocodiles of the \nWorld conservation and education centre (Witney, UK) at E10. They were randomly assigned into groups and \nincubated at 28\u2009\u00b0C or 32\u2009\u00b0C (n\u2009=\u200b\u20093 per group) with 90% relative humidity. Osteolaemus are a threatened spe-\ncies not commonly bred in captivity, which limited the number of fertilised eggs available. Prior data indicate a \nsmall degree of variation in the limb element lengths of wild crocodilians sampled from the same geographical \nlocation68. Dupont and Plummer\u2019s method for power and sample size calculations69 therefore indicate that the \nnumber of embryos required per group to detect a 10% change in limb element length with a power of 0.8 and \ntype I error of 0.05 with varying temperature is \u2265\u200b1. The chosen temperatures are within the ranges which produce \nviable, predominantly female hatchlings in captivity.\nEmbryo movement was monitored at intervals throughout incubation by candling the eggs and recording the \nnumber of visible movements during a 3\u2009minute period20. Mean frequency of movement values were compared \nusing Welch\u2019s t-test. Embryos were euthanised at E70. Snout to cloaca length was measured with a tape measure \nand mean values compared by Welch\u2019s t-test. The hindlimbs were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.\nChickens.\u2003 Fertilised eggs were incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C with 45% relative humidity. Eggs were \u2018windowed\u2019 on E4 using \nstandard protocols70,71: briefly, a small section of shell and shell membrane were removed using sterile forceps and \nthe shell was resealed with adhesive tape. Chicken embryos were immobilized with decamethonium bromide \n(DMB), which induces rigid paralysis35. Embryos were immobilized between E10\u201314, 10\u201318 13\u201316 and15\u201318. \nSterile filtered 5\u2009mg/ml DMB in 100\u2009\u03bc\u200bl Tyrode\u2019s solution was injected through the egg window onto the cho-\nrioallantoic membrane to induce immobilization. On each subsequent day, 100\u2009\u03bc\u200bl of 1\u2009mg/ml DMB in TS was \nadministered to maintain paralysis. Embryos were monitored by viewing through the egg window on each day of \ntreatment and any DMB-treated embryos which were not fully paralysed were excluded from the study. Control \nanimals received equivalent volumes of TS. The embryos were euthanized on the final day of treatment, hind-\nlimbs removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The sex of chicken embryos used for this study was unknown, \nbut previous studies indicate that sexual dimorphism in the growth of domestic chickens only occurs postnatally; \nbody mass and growth hormone expression do not diverge between males and females until 2\u20134 weeks post \nhatching72,73.\nEx vivo measurements of limb length from microCT scans.\u2003\nLimbs from crocodiles incubated at 28\u2009\u00b0C \nor 32\u2009\u00b0C (n\u2009=\u200b\u20093) and chickens treated with DMB or TS between E10\u201314, 13\u201316 and 15\u201318 (n\u2009=\u200b\u20095 per group) were \nstained with the contrast agent phosphotungstic acid (PTA) by immersing in a solution of 1% PTA 70% etha-\nnol for 72\u2009hours, to allow visualisation of cartilage by micro-computed tomography (microCT)74. Limbs were \nscanned with a SkyScan 1172 microCT system (Bruker, Belgium) with a resolution of 5\u2009\u03bc\u200bm, voltage of 40\u2009kv, \ncurrent of 250\u2009\u03bc\u200bA, exposure time of 1600\u2009ms and a 0.5\u2009mm aluminium filter. Images were reconstructed using \nNRecon and whole limb lengths and length of the femur, TBT and TMT elements measured using DataViewer \nsoftware (Bruker, Belgium). Limb measurements from the different chicken and crocodile groups were compared \nusing Mann-Whitney U-tests and Welch\u2019s t-tests, respectively.\nNoninvasive monitoring of embryonic limb growth in ovo.\u2003\nChicken embryos treated with TS (n\u2009=\u200b\u20096) \nor DMB (n\u2009=\u200b\u20094) between E10\u201318 were imaged daily between E14\u201318 with a Philips Intera 1.5\u2009T MR system with \na SENSE flex spinal coil (Philips Medical Systems). The eggs were cooled for 10\u2009minutes at 4\u2009\u00b0C prior to imaging \nto temporarily reduce embryo movement in TS treated chicks. The eggs were imaged in the dorsal plane using a \nfast field echo sequence with a flip angle of 60\u2009\u00b0C, echo time of 3.41\u2009ms and repetition time of 7.62\u2009ms. Time out of \nthe incubator for imaging did not vary between TS and DMB treated groups. The embryos were euthanized after \nthe final scan on E18 and staged according to the Hamburger and Hamilton staging series42 to assess the impact \nthat removing the eggs from the incubator daily and cooling had on embryonic development; staging was based \non third digit and beak length, which were measured with digital callipers. The scan images were imported into \nImageJ75 as image stacks and total limb length and element length were calculated by identifying the most prox-\nimal and distal bone points in the image stack76. Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to compare the DMB-treated \nembryo values to controls at each timepoint.\nSectioning and growth plate histology.\u2003\nFixed, dissected limbs from embryonic chicks treated with TS/\nDMB between E10\u201314 and E10\u201318 were processed to paraffin for embedding and sectioning. 6\u2009\u03bc\u200bm sections were \nstained with Toluidine blue. Sections were imaged using a DM4000B upright microscope and DC500 colour cam-\nera, both controlled through Leica Application Suite software version 2.8.1 (all from Leica Microsystems, Milton \nKeynes, UK). The objective used was a 10x HC PL FLUOTAR PH1 (NA\u2009=\u200b\u20090.3). Growth plate zones (proliferating/\nmaturing, prehypertrophic and hypertrophic) were identified based on cell morphology and organisation, meas-\nured and expressed as a proportion of the total growth plate width77 using ImageJ. All growth plate zones were \nidentified and measured by the same observer, and the growth plate images were temporarily assigned a random \nID number unrelated to treatment group during analysis to minimise bias. Mean growth plate widths were com-\npared using Welch\u2019s t-test.\nAssessment of cellular kinetics in the growth plate.\u2003\nWe performed immunohistochemistry to detect \nproliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and phosphohistone H3 using sections from the distal femoral growth \nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n15\nScientific REPOrTS | 7:41926 | DOI: 10.1038/srep41926\nplate of embryonic chicks treated with TS/DMB between E10\u201314 and \u2212\u200b18 (n\u2009=\u200b\u20095 per group, full method includ-\ning antibody dilutions in Supplementary\u00a0Methods). The epiphysis was divided into 4 zones to assess distribution \nof PCNA-labelled cells: the articular cartilage, \u201cresting\u201d zone, proliferating zone and prehyperophic/hypertrophic \nzone. The proportion of PCNA labelled cells to total DAPI labelled cells was calculated in each zone for PCNA, \nand in a representative view of the growth plate for phosphohistone H3. BrdU incorporation by proliferating cells \nwas assessed in TS/DMB treated embryos at E16, in embryos euthanised 4\u2009hours after BrdU administration (see \nSupplementary\u00a0methods). We quantified the number of BrdU-positive cells, expressed as a proportion of total \nDAPI-labelled cells, in the proliferative zone and prehypertrophic/hypertrophic zones using Image J. Sections \nwere imaged using a DM4000B upright microscope with samples illuminated using an EBQ100 light source and \nfilter cubes A4, L5, and TX2 (all from Leica Microsystems, Milton Keynes, UK) and an AxioCam MRm mon-\nochrome camera controlled through Axiovision software version 4.8.2 (Carl Zeiss Ltd, Cambridge, UK). The \nobjectives used were: 5x HC PL FLUOTAR (NA\u2009=\u200b\u20090.15); 10x HC PL FLUOTAR PH1 (NA\u2009=\u200b\u20090.3). Mean values \nfrom control and immobilized limbs were compared using Mann-Whitney U-test.\nThe size of chondrocytes from the distal femoral hypertrophic zone adjacent to the chondro-osseous junction \nwas assessed in freshly killed chicken embryos treated with TS or DMB between E10\u201314 and E10\u201318 (n\u2009=\u200b\u20096 in \neach group). One femur from each chick was removed and bisected sagitally78. The tissue was maintained at \n37\u2009\u00b0C in standard culture media until required, then incubated with 5\u2009\u03bc\u200bM calcein AM for 15\u2009minutes at 37\u2009\u00b0C to \nfluorescently label viable cells. A representative area from the base of the hypertrophic zone was then collected \nas an image stack in 3D using an SP5 confocal microscope using Leica Application Suite advanced fluorescence \nsoftware version 2.6 (Leica Microsystems, Milton Keynes, UK). The objective used was a 40x HCX PL FLUOTAR \nPH2 (NA\u2009=\u200b\u20090.75). The average maximum cell area of calcein AM labelled hypertrophic chondrocytes was quanti-\nfied from image stacks from representative regions from the hypertrophic zone in control and immobilized chicks \n(\u2009>\u200b\u200920 cells per growth plate) using ImageJ and compared using Mann-Whitney U-test. Apoptosis was evaluated \nusing TUNEL assay (see Supplementary\u00a0Methods).\nRNA extraction and Microarray analysis.\u2003\nThe hindlimbs were dissected from freshly killed embryos \ntreated with either TS or DMB from E10 onwards. The growth cartilage from the distal femur and proximal \nTBT was dissected. Any fully ossified bone, bone marrow and red blood cells were excluded. The tissue was \nsnap-frozen by immersing in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u2212\u200b80\u2009\u00b0C until required. The tissue was not allowed \nto thaw prior to RNA isolation. The following samples were collected: control femur and TBT RNA from E12, \ncontrol femur and TBT RNA from E13, control femur and TBT RNA from E15, immobilised femur and TBT \nRNA from E15 (n\u2009=\u200b\u20093 biological replicates in each group. Each biological replicate contained the pooled growth \ncartilage from 4 individual chicken embryos.\nTotal RNA was isolated using TRizol\u00ae\u200b (Life Technologies). RNA was dissolved in 20\u2009\u03bc\u200bl RNAse-free water. \nAffymetrix DNA microarrays (Chicken) were processed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (BEA Core \nfacility, Huddinge Hospital, Sweden). From the twenty four samples processed, 1 sample was excluded as an \noutlier by visually evaluating principal component analysis prior to down-stream analysis. The raw data has been \ndeposited at the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession no.: GSE77412). Aroma.affymetrix79 and Bioconductor80 \npackages in R were used to preprocess the CEL files and generate summarized expression matrices. A standard \ndeviation filter (SD\u2009=\u200b\u200910) was applied to remove low expressed invariant probe-sets (which reflect background \nsignal or poorly functioning probesets) and this value is array type specific (obtained by first plotting the distri-\nbution of SD values). For annotation, the Chicken_Gg_ENST, binary.cdf was used. For comparing various groups \nan unpaired SAMR (significance analysis of microarrays) analysis was used to estimate the false discovery rate \n(FDR) using 5,000 permutations. The nearest FDR value to 5% was utilized in the pathway or ontology analysis. \nThere are limitations to the usefulness of pathway or gene ontology (GO) analysis for identifying enrichments \nof biological functions among genes in a list of regulated genes81. Thus, to interpret a significant p-value for GO \nanalysis as being evidence of specific enrichment, the \u2018regulated gene list\u2019 (in this case genes with AEU events) \nmust be contrasted with a list of the detectable genes in the experiment (and not all the genes in the genome or on \nthe gene-chip). Only when the experimentally regulated list contains enriched p-values well above those observed \ndue to bias did we consider the observation reliable. As well as Ingenuity IPA analysis we utilized GOstats package \nin R with current GO categories (GO.db) to confirm the IPA analysis. Input gene lists, and related background \nexpression gene lists were used in IPA and GO with an ~5% FDR and no-fold change filter. The latter is used \nbecause it is well established that a large number of coordinated but modest gene expression changes can mean-\ningfully underlie shifts in pathway regulation.\nReferences\n1.\t Towers, M. & Tickle, C.

Mace2\n1 Division of Biology, Imperial College London, Silwood Park, United Kingdom, 2 Centre for Population Biology, Imperial College London, Silwood Park, United Kingdom\nSummary\nMany species are experiencing sus-\ntained environmental change mainly due\nto human activities. The unusual rate and\nextent of anthropogenic alterations of the\nenvironment may exceed the capacity of\ndevelopmental, genetic, and demographic\nmechanisms that populations have evolved\nto deal with environmental change. To\nbegin to understand the limits to popula-\ntion persistence, we present a simple\nevolutionary model for the critical rate of\nenvironmental change beyond which a\npopulation must decline and go extinct.\nWe use this model to highlight the major\ndeterminants\nof\nextinction\nrisk\nin\na\nchanging environment, and identify re-\nsearch needs for improved predictions\nbased on projected changes in environ-\nmental variables. Two key parameters\nrelating the environment to population\nbiology have not yet received sufficient\nattention. Phenotypic plasticity, the direct\ninfluence of environment on the develop-\nment of individual phenotypes, is increas-\ningly considered an important component\nof phenotypic change in the wild and\nshould be incorporated in models of\npopulation\npersistence.\nEnvironmental\nsensitivity of selection, the change in the\noptimum phenotype with the environ-\nment, still crucially needs empirical assess-\nment. We use environmental tolerance\ncurves and other examples of ecological\nand evolutionary responses to climate\nchange to illustrate how these mechanistic\napproaches can be developed for predic-\ntive purposes.\nIntroduction\nGlobal climate change, over-exploita-\ntion, and habitat alteration are causing\nsustained and consistent pressures on wild\npopulations [1]. Because of habitat frag-\nmentation, many species will not be able\nto track their preferred environment in\nspace, and must therefore adapt in situ to\navoid extinction. What determines the\nmaximum rate of environmental change\nthat populations can cope with? Under-\nstanding this will inform both models and\nmanagement plans about where critical\nthresholds lie or what might affect the\npotential resilience of particular species or\necological communities.\nTwo main approaches exist for studying\nthe impact of environmental change on\nspecies persistence\u2014niche modelling and\nmechanistic population modelling. On the\none hand, \u2018\u2018climate envelope models\u2019\u2019 (or\n\u2018\u2018niche models\u2019\u2019) are correlative and fo-\ncused on the environment. Their concep-\ntual background traces to Hutchinson\u2019s\nmultidimensional representation of the\nniche [2]. They use measurements of\nenvironmental variables and records of\nspecies presence and absence to infer\nabiotic correlates of the realized niche of\na species. By projecting this niche on a\nmap with environmental data, the spatial\nlocations that satisfy the basic require-\nments of the species are identified. Niche\nmodels have been combined with climate\nprojections to predict range shifts and\nextinction\nrates\n[3].\nAside\nfrom\nthe\nmethodological caveats of this approach\n(changing covariance of environmental\nvariables [4], population demography not\nin equilibrium with changing climate [5],\nspatial scale of the analysis [6,7], and\nsource-sink dynamics allowing individuals\nto exist outside their niche [8]), its major\ndrawback is that it does not account for\nthe biological processes underlying adap-\ntation of a species to its environment. It\ncannot identify or incorporate the biolog-\nical differences among species that deter-\nmine whether or not they can persist in\nsitu. While a new generation of \u2018\u2018process-\nbased\u2019\u2019 (or \u2018\u2018mechanistic\u2019\u2019) niche models is\nbeing developed to overcome these limi-\ntations [9\u201311], they currently rely on\nsimplified\ndemographic\nprocesses\nand\ngenerally overlook evolution in response\nto climate change (but see [12]). Niche\nmodelling is thus currently more suited to\nunderstand changes in the distribution of\nsuitable environments for a species at a\ncontinental scale than to predict popula-\ntion persistence or guide conservation\nplans.\nOn the other hand, mechanistic popu-\nlation modelling focuses on the biological\nprocesses that underlie population persis-\ntence. By combining evolutionary genetics\nand\ndemography,\nthe\nconditions\nthat\nallow a population to maintain a positive\nintrinsic\ngrowth\nrate\nin\nthe\nface\nof\nenvironmental change can be predicted\ntheoretically [13,14] and studied empiri-\ncally [15]. The main focus of mechanistic\npopulation studies is not environmental\nvariables, but ecologically important phe-\nnotypic traits (morphology, physiology,\nphenology, or behaviour) that affect pop-\nulation growth through their influence on\nlife history. In contrast to niche modelling,\nthis\napproach\nallows\nidentification\nof\nEssays articulate a specific perspective on a topic of\nbroad interest to scientists.\nCitation: Chevin L-M, Lande R, Mace GM (2010) Adaptation, Plasticity, and Extinction in a Changing\nEnvironment: Towards a Predictive Theory.

This model generaliz-\nes an earlier one by Lynch and Lande\n[13] by including phenotypic plasticity\n(see Box 1\u2013Glossary) and an explicit\nenvironmental variable such as tempera-\nture. We use it to highlight the determi-\nnants of extinction risk and to identify\nresearch needs for a more predictive\napproach to population persistence in a\nchanging environment. Research directed\ntowards key determinants of extinction\nrisk that are often overlooked in current\nempirical work may allow population\nbiologists to take advantage of abundant\nenvironmental data in order to begin\ndeveloping predictions about population\npersistence under alternative scenarios of\nclimate change [16], which can help to\nguide conservation policies and manage-\nment plans.\nExtinction Risk under Sustained\nEnvironmental Change\nThere are three mechanisms by which a\npopulation can persist when its local\nenvironment changes: dispersal to track\nits preferred environment in space, genetic\nevolution to the new local conditions, or\nphenotypic plasticity [17,18]. Using the\nmodel in Box 2 and Text S1, we give an\noverview of the determinants of extinction\nrisk for an isolated population with a\nrestricted geographic range under sus-\ntained environmental change, assuming\ndispersal is not possible. We consider cases\nwhere all other possible factors influencing\nextinction risk (demographic and environ-\nmental stochasticity, inbreeding depres-\nsion, genetic drift [19]) can be ignored\nrelative to the impact of sustained envi-\nronmental change. The determinants of\nextinction risk then belong to three main\nclasses.\n(1) Demographic properties of the population.\nThese are components of the population\ngrowth rate that are not affected by\nadaptation to the changing environment.\nThey include the generation time, T, and\nthe maximum intrinsic rate of increase rmax\n(per unit time) of a population with\noptimum mean phenotype. Even if these\nparameters are not affected by the envi-\nronmental change, they do constrain the\nrate of adaptation. Populations with longer\ngenerations must evolve faster per gener-\nation to adapt to a given rate of environ-\nmental change, and populations with a\nlow rmax will reach extinction before they\ncan adapt to rapid environmental change\n[13\u201315,20]. The specific influence of each\nof these variables on extinction risk across\ntaxa also depends on their covariation.\nBroad-scale studies of life-history traits\nindicate that the per-generation intrinsic\nrate of increase is of the same order of\nmagnitude across several taxa, whereas\nrmax per unit time is roughly inversely\nproportional\nto\nthe\ngeneration\ntime\n[21\u201323]. As a consequence, the critical\nrate of environmental change should be\ngenerally lower for species with longer\ngeneration times, which will be at greater\nextinction risk.\n(2) Evolutionary potential. This measures\nhow fast genetic evolution occurs for a\ngiven deviation of the mean phenotype\nfrom\nthe\noptimum.\nThe\nstrength\nof\nstabilizing selection c measures how the\nmean fitness decreases with the squared\ndeviation from the optimum and also\ndetermines the strength of directional\nselection for a given deviation from the\noptimum. Stronger stabilizing selection\n(larger\nc),\nalthough\ncausing\nincreased\nmortality,\nallows\nfaster\nenvironmental\nchange to be tolerated by causing faster\nevolution [13]. The genetic variance, the\nproduct of phenotypic variance s2 and\nheritability\nh2,\ndetermines\nhow\nmuch\ngenetic evolution is caused by a given\nstrength of selection. Higher genetic var-\niance allows persistence under stronger\nenvironmental change, because it allows\nthe population to track its phenotypic\noptimum more closely. Although we focus\non a single trait for simplicity, this may\nactually\nbe\na\nlinear\ncombination\nof\nmeasurable traits. In this case, the genetic\nvariances of the original traits and their\ngenetic covariances affect the magnitude\nBox 1.

This\nlinks the environment to the biology of\nindividuals\nin\nthe\nspecies.\nPhenotypic\nplasticity describes the direct impact of\nthe environment on the development of\nindividual phenotypes. It may involve\nmorphological, physiological or behav-\nioural responses, which can occur on\ndifferent\ntime\nscales.\nFor\ncontinuous\nenvironmental variables, plasticity usually\nis modelled using reaction norms, where\nthe phenotype of a given genotype is\nplotted as a function of the environment\n[26]. We focus on linear reaction norms\nfor simplicity, although reaction norms\ncan be non-linear [27,28] (see below).\nWith linear reaction norms, the slope b\nquantifies the degree of plasticity. The\nenvironmental sensitivity of selection, B,\nmeasures how the optimum phenotype\nchanges with the environment, which for\nsimplicity we also assume is a linear\nrelationship. With no cost of plasticity,\npopulations with b closer to B are likely to\npersist under higher rates of environmen-\ntal change.\nA Research Program\nThis model can be combined with\nenvironmental projections to ask whether\nfuture rates of environmental change will\nthreaten\nthe\npersistence\nof\nparticular\npopulations or species. Application of the\nmodel\nrequires\nmultiple\nsteps,\nwhich\npreviously have been undertaken in isola-\ntion or in combination, although all have\nrarely been completed together.\nIdentify Ecologically Important Traits\nAffecting Population Growth\nEcological investigation in the field is\nneeded to identify traits that potentially\ndetermine adaptation to a specific envi-\nronment. For instance, for ectotherms\nsuch\nas\ninsects\nand\nreptiles,\nthermal\nadaptation may occur not only through\nphysiological traits governing energy me-\ntabolism, but also through behavioural\nand\nmorphological\ntraits\ninvolved\nin\nmovement between shaded and sunny\npatches [29]. For many bird species,\nadaptation to global warming involves\nadjusting their breeding date so that\nreproduction coincides with a peak in\nprey density [30].\nThe strength (and direction) of natural\nselection c has been estimated in many\nplant and animal taxa by regressing the\nfitness of individuals on their phenotypes\n[31,32]. Most of these studies focus on\nrelative fitness, which determines the evo-\nlutionary dynamics. However, absolute\nfitness and rmax are needed to understand\nhow phenotypic traits influence population\ndynamics. Analysis of natural selection has\nbeen extended to age- or stage-structured\npopulations, allowing identification of parts\nof the life cycle where phenotypes most\nstrongly influence demography [33\u201336].\nBox 2. A Model of Phenotypic Evolution and Persistence under\nSustained Environmental Change\nWe assume that a continuous environmental parameter e (e.g., temperature or\nprecipitation) changes at a constant rate g in time. Adaptation to this changing\nenvironment is mediated by a quantitative trait z that determines fitness. Selection\non multiple correlated traits also can be incorporated [20], but for simplicity we focus\non single trait. Population growth is assumed to be density-independent, which can\nbe a good approximation even with density dependence, if the population remains\nwell below the carrying capacity because of maladaptation. In contrast to the original\nmodel and its recent extensions [13,20], we include phenotypic plasticity in the trait z,\nsuch that a given change in the environment directly modifies the phenotype of each\nindividual by a constant amount. The rate of environmental change is expressed per\nunit time (e.g., uC per year) instead of per generation.\nUnder\nsustained\nenvironmental\nchange,\nassuming\nconstant\ngenetic\nand\nphenotypic variance and strength of stabilizing selection, the rate of phenotypic\nevolution eventually reaches a steady state where the mean phenotype lags a\nconstant distance behind the changing optimum phenotype (Text S1). If this\ndistance is such that the population has a negative growth rate, extinction occurs.\nThe maximum rate of environmental change that allows long-term persistence of\nthe population (or critical rate of environmental change) is\ngc~\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\n2rmaxc\nT\nr\nh2s2\nB{b\nj\nj :\n\u00f01\u00de\nThe original model [13] revealed how the phenotypic variance s2 and heritability\nh2 of the trait, the strength of stabilizing selection c, and the maximum intrinsic\nrate of population growth rmax determined the critical rate of environmental\nchange in the absence of phenotypic plasticity.\nThree other parameters included here emphasize important factors affecting\npersistence\nwhen\nthe\ndirectional\nenvironmental\nchange\nis\nexpressed\nin\nenvironmental units per unit time. First is the generation time T. The remaining\ntwo parameters are the environmental sensitivity of selection B, which measures\nhow changes in the environment influence the optimum phenotype, and\nphenotypic plasticity b, which quantifies the direct impact of the environment on\ndevelopment of individual phenotypes. The critical rate of environmental change\nfor long-term persistence increases with decreasing absolute difference between\nthe environmental sensitivity of selection and phenotypic plasticity. Although\nplasticity causes weaker natural selection on the trait and smaller genetic\nresponse to selection, this is more than compensated by the plastic phenotypic\nchange that brings the mean phenotype closer to the optimum (Text S1).\nPlasticity may also entail a fitness cost [59]. The cost of plasticity decreases rmax,\nwhich can then be formulated as\nrmax~ r0{b2\u0003\n2v2\nb\n\u0004\n\u0005\nT\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere r0 is the per-generation growth rate of a population with optimum\nphenotype and no plasticity, and 1\n\u0003\nv2\nb quantifies the magnitude of the cost for a\ngiven plasticity b. By decreasing rmax, the cost of plasticity decreases the critical\nrate of environmental change, thus opposing the beneficial effect of plasticity on\ngc. The overall effect of phenotypic plasticity on the critical rate of environmental\nchange is shown in Figure 2 for several values of the cost of plasticity. When the\ncost of plasticity is above a threshold (v2\nbvv2\nlim), there is an intermediate value of\nplasticity that maximizes the critical rate of environmental change.\nPLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org\n3\nApril 2010 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e1000357\nEstimate Genetic Variance and\nPlasticity\nThe question of whether genetic varia-\ntion (h2s2) along the direction of natural\nselection limits the rate of evolution has\nmotivated many studies. For instance, in\nthe North American prairie plant Chamae-\ncrista fasciculate, small genetic variance for a\nlinear combination of traits has been\npredicted to limit the response to selection\ncaused by climate change [25]. Similarly,\nit was suggested that lack of genetic\nvariation for desiccation and cold resis-\ntance restricts the geographic range of\nseveral Drosophila species [37] and would\nlimit the response to projected climate\nchange in one of them [38]. Changes in\nthe genetic and phenotypic variation with\nthe environment may also be important.\nFor example, the response to selection on\nbody weight in wild Soay sheep is reduced\nbecause of lower heritability in environ-\nments where selection is stronger [39].\nThe importance of phenotypic plasticity\nfor rapid evolution in response to direc-\ntional environmental change has only\nrecently been fully appreciated. Many\nauthors have observed adaptive phenotyp-\nic evolution without being able to firmly\nattribute it to genetic change (reviewed in\n[40]), but relatively\nfew studies have\nprogressed from considering plasticity as\na nuisance parameter to measuring norms\nof reaction, and their slopes b, in the\ncontext of climate change [41]. This was\ndone recently for reproductive timing in\nmammals [42] and birds [43,44].\nMeasure the Environmental\nSensitivity of Selection\nFew investigators have measured the\nenvironmental sensitivity of phenotypic\nselection as described by parameter B in\nBox 2. The most relevant studies have\nmeasured selection in a small number of\ndiscrete environments. This approach has\nbeen applied to birds to describe the\ninfluence of changing seasonality on selec-\ntion on breeding date [45], and in plants\nto examine the impact of drought on\nselection on physiological traits [46,47]. It\nhas also been combined with experimental\nmanipulation of the environment, mainly\nin plants, using either abiotic [48] or biotic\nfactors,\nsuch\nas\ncrowding\n[49,50]\nor\nnatural enemies [51,52]. Other studies\nhave employed ecological criteria to iden-\ntify changes in the optimum phenotype\nwithout actually measuring selection. For\ninstance, the optimum egg-laying date for\nbirds can be deduced from the temporal\npeak in food availability determined by the\npopulation dynamics of insects on which\nthey feed [53].\nWhat emerges from this brief outline is\nthat two key areas of study are lacking: the\nquantification of the environmental sensi-\ntivity of selection across continuous envi-\nronments and the detailed investigation of\nphenotypic plasticity, including its costs\nand limits under sustained environmental\nchange.\nFurther\nwork,\nsuch\nas\nthat\noutlined below, would begin to make\npredictive approaches possible.\nPhenotypic Selection along an\nEnvironmental Gradient\nA relationship between an environmen-\ntal variable and a measure of selection,\neither observed in the wild or derived from\nan experiment, has been argued to be the\nstrongest evidence for the cause of natural\nselection [54]. Quantification of this rela-\ntionship is required to predict population\nevolution and persistence in a changing\nenvironment. Most of the studies high-\nlighted above compared selective pressures\namong discrete environmental states, often\ninterpreted\nas\nstresses\n(but\nsee\n[39]).\nenvironment \ntrait\nenvironment \nfitness\nReaction \nnorms\nAdaptive \nlandscape\nTolerance \ncurves\nfitness\nenvironment \ntrait\nFigure 1.

The environ-\nmental\nsensitivity\nof\nselection\nshould\ntherefore\nbe\nestimated\nby\nmeasuring\nphenotypic selection along a continuous\nenvironmental gradient. Apart from mea-\nsuring a fundamental parameter of the\nmodel, this would also allow its basic\nassumptions to be tested. In particular, our\nmodel (like previous ones) assumes that\nenvironmental change primarily alters the\noptimum phenotype with little impact on\nthe width of the fitness function (Figure 1),\nbut this assumption has hardly ever been\ntested empirically.\nMeasurement of selection in several\nenvironments may be difficult to carry\nout in the field because of lack of con-\ntrol over environmental parameters. For\nsome species such measurements could be\nperformed in controlled laboratory con-\nditions, provided the relationship between\nfitness in the laboratory and in the wild\ncan be established. Alternatively, perfor-\nmance can be measured in the laboratory\nand\nthe\nrelationship\nbetween\nperfor-\nmance and fitness assessed in the wild\n[55].\nStudies of thermal tolerance curves in\nectotherms commonly measure fitness in\ncontinuous environments. However, these\nstudies generally relate fitness (or perfor-\nmance)\ndirectly\nto\nthe\nenvironment,\nwhich\nmakes\nit\ndifficult\nto\nproduce\nevolutionary predictions and to test them\nexperimentally [56]. Modelling tolerance\ncurves with an underlying phenotypic\ntrait subject to natural selection and\nphenotypic plasticity may prove more\nfruitful, since it should allow predictions\nabout the dynamics of tolerance curve\nevolution (Box 3).\nCosts and Limits of Plasticity in\na Changing Environment\nPlasticity in Extreme Environments\nThe model in Box 2 assumes a linear\nreaction norm, implying that a given\namount of environmental change always\nproduces\nthe same plastic phenotypic\nchange. Plasticity is generally studied in\nthe context of environments that vary in\nspace or fluctuate in time with a stationary\ndistribution, but little is known about\nplastic responses outside the usual range\nof variation. Extreme environments may\ndisrupt the plastic response, such that the\nreaction norm may take any shape in\nenvironments that were rarely encoun-\ntered before [57]. This argument is based\non the theory of the evolution of reaction\nnorm\nin\nheterogeneous\nenvironments,\nassuming little genetic constraint on reac-\ntion norm shape. However, reaction norm\nshapes are likely to be genetically con-\nstrained. For many traits, plastic pheno-\ntypic responses should reach a physiolog-\nical\nlimit\nand\n\u2018\u2018saturate\u2019\u2019\nin\nextreme\nenvironments [58]. For instance, body size\nor metabolic rate obviously cannot in-\ncrease\nor\ndecrease\nindefinitely\nunder\nsustained environmental change. For oth-\ner traits, disruption of homeostasis may\ncause the plastic response to be amplified\nin extreme environments. Both of these\nmechanisms could generate skewed toler-\nance curves like those observed for re-\nsponse to temperature, even when pheno-\ntypic selection is symmetric (Box 3).\nCosts of Plasticity and the Generalist\nversus Specialist Trade-Off\nPhenotypic plasticity may entail several\ntypes of fitness costs to the organism\nindependent of the expressed phenotype\n[59]. Here, we shall only distinguish two\nkinds of costs of plasticity: constitutive and\ninduced. A constitutive cost reduces indi-\nvidual\nfitness depending only on the\ndegree of plasticity. This includes the cost\nof maintaining physiological machinery\nthat allows phenotypic plasticity or acquir-\ning information about the environment\n[59]. The model in Box 2 focuses on such\ncosts. In contrast an induced cost is a\nreduction in fitness that depends on the\namount of plastic phenotypic change. This\nkind of cost is physiological and can be\nBox 3. Tolerance Curves and Phenotypic Plasticity\nEnvironmental tolerance curves relating fitness (or performance) to abiotic\nenvironmental variables such as temperature [56] or salinity [77] have been\nstudied for a wide variety of organisms, ranging from reptiles and amphibians to\ninsects and plants [56]. They are generally characterized by a few descriptive\nvariables, such as critical environments (where fitness or performance vanishes),\noptimum environment (where fitness is maximized), and skewness. Previous\nmodels investigated the benefits of broad versus narrow tolerance curves under\nseveral forms of environmental change [61,62,78], but they failed to produce\npredictions about the dynamics of and constrains on tolerance curve evolution.\nRecently there have been calls for new theoretical developments with clearer\nempirically testable outcomes [56].\nWe propose that incorporating phenotypically plastic traits, which are under\nstabilizing selection through their influence on lifetime fitness [33,34,79], can\nclarify how tolerance curves emerge and evolve (Figure 1). With linear reaction\nnorms and constant strength of stabilizing selection across environments (ridge\nwith constant width in the adaptive landscape), the reaction norm slope\ndetermines tolerance breadth, while the reaction norm intercept (or elevation)\ndetermines the optimum environment (first column in Figure 1). With genetic\nvariation in the slope of reaction norms, the tolerance breadth may evolve as a\nconsequence of evolving phenotypic plasticity in the underlying trait. Including a\ncost of plasticity, where fitness decreases with reaction norm slope regardless of\nthe trait value [80,81], produces a generalist\u2013specialist trade-off between\ntolerance breadth and maximum fitness, corresponding to the intuitive idea that\na \u2018\u2018Jack-of-all-trades is a master of none.\u2019\u2019 This is illustrated in the bottom left\npanel of Figure 1\u2014with cost an increasing function of plasticity (dashed lines), the\nred dashed tolerance curve has a lower maximum fitness than the green dashed\ncurve, because the former reaction norm has greater plasticity. This approach can\nbe used to make testable predictions in specific cases based on measures of the\nvariability, inheritance, and plasticity of phenotypic traits.\nThermal tolerance curves generally are strongly skewed, with fitness decreasing\nsteeply as temperature approaches the critical thermal maximum [56]. This could\nbe caused by non-linear reaction norms for underlying traits, as illustrated by the\nsecond column in Figure 1. Plastic phenotypic responses that saturate (yellow\ngenotype) or increase exponentially (green genotype) in extreme environments\ncould both induce skewed tolerance curves. Alternatively, skewed tolerance\ncurves could be caused by the strength of stabilizing selection (width of the\nfitness ridge) changing with the environment (third column in Figure 1). Finally,\nthe fitness function acting on the trait may itself be skewed in all environments,\nthe height of the fitness ridge may depend on the environment, or the optimum\nphenotype may change non-linearly with the environment (not shown). These\nfive possible causes of skewness have different implications for the evolution of\nthermal tolerance in a changing environment, and need to be tested empirically.\nPLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org\n5\nApril 2010 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e1000357\nunderstood in terms of constraints on\nenergy allocation. It applies mainly to\nlabile traits that may change repeatedly\nduring the lifetime of an individual, such\nas breeding date for birds [60].\nIn the literature on tolerance curves, the\ncost of plasticity is generally expressed as a\ntrade-off between tolerance breadth and\nfitness\nin\nthe\noptimum\nenvironment,\ncorresponding to the intuitive idea that\nthe\n\u2018\u2018Jack-of-all-trades\nis\na\nmaster\nof\nnone.\u2019\u2019 This has been modelled [61,62],\nbut the empirical evidence is still contro-\nversial\n[56,63]\nand\nbased\nmainly\non\ncomparative data among taxa rather than\non within-species variation (but see [64]).\nWe propose that this trade-off may be a\nconsequence of the cost of plasticity for an\nunderlying\nphenotypic\ntrait\n(Box\n3,\nFigure 1).\nIn the model of Box 2 and Figure 2, we\nshow how a constitutive cost of plasticity\ncan limit the critical rate of environmental\nchange for population persistence. An\ninduced cost would yield a similar result\nin\nthis\nmodel\nsince\nthe\nenvironment\nchanges at a constant rate. The cost of\nplasticity may thus limit population per-\nsistence in a changing environment, yet\nlittle is known about its importance in\nnatural\npopulations.\nA\nrecent\nreview\nshowed that such costs may be widespread\nbut weak [65]. Further research is needed\nto measure costs of plasticity for organisms\nwith\nlong\ngenerations\n(such\nas\nlarge\nmammals and trees) or with life cycles\nthat depend on seasonal timing (e.g.,\ninteraction of temperature and photoperi-\nod [66]), which rely most on plasticity to\npersist in a rapidly changing environment.\nLimitations of the Model\nOur\nmodel\nincludes\na\nnumber\nof\nsimplifying assumptions. We assume a\nconstant shape of the fitness function\nacross environments, allowing only the\noptimum phenotype to change with the\nenvironment. However, the strength of\nstabilizing selection around the optimum\nphenotype c may depend on the environ-\nment (Figure 1, third column, second row).\nFurthermore the maximum fitness rmax\nmay generally be lower in more extreme\nenvironments\nbecause\nof\nphysiological\nconstraints,\nsuch\nthat\nthe\nridge\nin\nFigure 1 would have an intermediate\nmaximum. This was shown to occur in a\nrecent\ncomparative\nstudy\nof\nthermal\ntolerance curves among several insect\ntaxa, where the maximum fitness was\nlower for species that had their optimum\nat\na\nlower\ntemperature\n[67].\nOther\ndemographic parameters including the\ngeneration time T may change with the\nenvironment. Genotype 6 environment\ninteraction (or genetic variance in plastic-\nity) can cause the genetic variance (h2s2) to\ndepend\non\nthe\nenvironment\n[68\u201371].\nAlthough these mechanisms are not in-\ncluded in our simple model, they all can be\nanalyzed theoretically and studied empir-\nically, and should be included where they\nare suspected to be important.\nPlasticity itself may evolve if it varies\ngenetically, and new environments can\ncause directional selection on plasticity\n[72,73]. However, more information is\nneeded about plasticity and its inheritance\nin extreme environments before the evo-\nlution of plasticity can be included in the\nanalysis of persistence under sustained\nenvironmental change.\nFinally, we considered a population that\ncannot disperse nor receive migrants from\nother populations experiencing different\nenvironments. We focused on this situa-\ntion\nbecause\nit\nis\none\nthat\nis\nmost\ncommonly overlooked in niche modelling\nstudies. Our model thus applies best to\nspecies with habitats restricted by dispersal\nbarriers or species which disperse slowly\nrelative to the rate of environmental\nchange [74]. At the other extreme, a\npopulation may be able to persist by\nfollowing its preferred environment in\nspace without any evolution, as assumed\nin niche modelling, but this is very unlikely\nfor species occupying fragmented habitats.\nFor populations that can both disperse and\nevolve in response to a changing environ-\nment, gene flow among populations with\ndifferent environments may limit local\nadaptation and restrict the geographic\nrange of the population or even cause\nextinction [74,75].\nConclusion\nOur aim was to describe an approach\nbased on evolutionary and demographic\nmechanisms that can be used to make\npredictions on population persistence in a\nchanging environment and to highlight\nthe most important variables to measure.\nWhile this approach is obviously more\ncostly and time-consuming than niche\nmodelling, its results are also likely to be\nmore useful for specific purposes because it\nexplicitly incorporates the factors that limit\npopulation\nresponse\nto\nenvironmental\nchange.\nThe feasibility of such a mechanistic\napproach has been demonstrated by a few\nrecent studies. Deutsch et al.

The present study compared the extent and time course\nof anodal tDCS-induced plastic changes in primary motor cortex (M1) in young and older\nadults. Furthermore, as it has been suggested that neuroplasticity and associated learning\ndepends on the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene polymorphisms, we also\nassessed the impact of BDNF polymorphism on these effects. Corticospinal excitability\nwas examined using transcranial magnetic stimulation before and following (0, 10, 20,\n30 min) anodal tDCS (30 min, 1 mA) or sham in young and older adults. While the overall\nextent of increases in corticospinal excitability induced by anodal tDCS did not vary reliably\nbetween young and older adults, older adults exhibited a delayed response; the largest\nincrease in corticospinal excitability occurred 30 min following stimulation for older adults,\nbut immediately post-stimulation for the young group. BDNF genotype did not result in\nsigni\ufb01cant differences in the observed excitability increases for either age group. The\npresent study suggests that tDCS-induced plastic changes are delayed as a result of healthy\naging, but that the overall ef\ufb01cacy of the plasticity mechanism remains unaffected.\nKeywords: aging, plasticity, transcranial direct current stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, brain-derived\nneurotrophic factor\nINTRODUCTION\nTranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive\nbrain stimulation (NIBS) technique that induces transmem-\nbrane neuronal potential and thus in\ufb02uences the level of cortical\nexcitability (see review Nitsche et al., 2008; Zaghi et al., 2010). It is\nthought that the neuronal changes associated with the persisting\neffects of tDCS are analogous to activity-dependent synaptic plas-\nticity, i.e., long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression\n(LTD; Di Lazzaro et al., 2012). There are a number of lines of\nevidence for the induction of LTP by DC stimulation. Fritsch\net al. (2010) showed that the synaptic effects of direct current\nstimulation which induced LTP in mouse motor cortex (M1)\nslices is dependent on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor\nactivation. Ranieri et al. (2012) further demonstrated that DC\nstimulation applied to rat brain slices modulated LTP in a polar-\nity speci\ufb01c manner, i.e., modulation of LTP was increased by\nanodal and reduced by cathodal DC stimulation. Pharmacolog-\nical studies have also shown that tDCS after-effects are affected\nby NMDA receptor antagonist dextromethorphane (Nitsche et al.,\n2003a; Ranieri et al., 2012). These results strongly indicate that the\neffects induced by tDCS share similarities with activity-dependent\nsynaptic plasticity, such as LTP and LTD (Di Lazzaro et al., 2012).\nFurthermore, DC stimulation also modulates LTP induced by\nother NIBS techniques and interferes with learning and mem-\nory processes which are strongly associated with LTP (Kim and\nLinden, 2007). Thus tDCS is considered to have capacity to induce\nLTP/LTD-like plasticity.\nThe application of tDCS over M1 elicits changes in corti-\ncospinal excitability in a polarity speci\ufb01c manner: motor evoked\npotentials (MEPs) evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation\n(TMS) are potentiated by anodal tDCS and suppressed by catho-\ndal tDCS (Nitsche and Paulus, 2000). Furthermore, the technique\nis extremely well tolerated by most individuals and allows an easily\napplied sham condition to which the participant is readily blinded.\nFinally, it has been shown that tDCS can be combined with motor\nand cognitive tasks to facilitate learning.\nDespite the abundance of research on the behavioral effects\nof tDCS on motor function (see review Reis and Fritsch, 2011)\nshowing increased levels of performance in both healthy (Nitsche\net al., 2003b; Antal et al., 2004; Vines et al., 2006) and clini-\ncal populations, such as stroke patients (Hummel et al., 2005;\nKim et al., 2009), only a limited number of studies have inves-\ntigated the effects of tDCS over M1 in healthy older adults\n(Hummel et al., 2010; Zimerman et al., 2013). These two studies\ndid not, however, assess the tDCS-induced changes in corti-\ncospinal excitability. While the behavioral improvements suggest\nthat the plastic changes within M1 induced by tDCS were sub-\nstantial enough to elicit behavioral change, it is unknown whether\nthese neural changes varied relative to the changes expected in\nyoung adults. Indeed, there is some evidence that older individuals\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience\nwww.frontiersin.org\nJune 2014 | Volume 6 | Article 115 | 1\nFujiyama et al.\nIs aging brain plastic?\nmay have reduced neuroplasticity (Fathi et al., 2010), at least when\nassessed by the paired-associative stimulation (PAS) technique.\nThe overall conclusion that can be drawn is that there is no con-\nsensus on the degree to which neuroplasticity is affected by healthy\naging (Oliviero, 2010).\nRecently, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) a neu-\nrotrophin within the secretory protein family, has been suggested\nto play a crucial role in neuroplasticity and associated learning\n(Pascual-Leone et al., 2011). The most common forms of BDNF\npolymorphism are Val66Met and Val66Val (Lu, 2003). These\nBDNF polymorphisms have been shown to differentially mod-\nulate human cortical plasticity as a response to training (Kleim\net al., 2006), brain stimulation (Cheeran et al., 2008), and motor\nlearning (Fritsch et al., 2010). Thus, the BDNF example suggests\nthat individuals with a certain genetic predisposition may show a\ndifferent response to interventions that modulate brain plasticity \u2013\neither in a use-dependent manner (i.e., motor or cognitive train-\ning) or induced via NIBS techniques. The relationship between\ntDCS induced aftereffects and BDNF genotype, however, is still\nunclear.\nGiven the current uncertainty as to the effects of aging on neu-\nroplasticity in M1 and its interaction with BDNF genotype, the\npresent study investigated, for the \ufb01rst time, age-related changes\nin the degree of plasticity following anodal tDCS (facilitatory)\nand the in\ufb02uence of BDNF gene polymorphisms on neuroplastic-\nity in the aging brain. Recently, large inter-individual variability\nin response to NIBS techniques has been recognized (M\u00fcller-\nDahlhaus et al., 2008; Datta et al., 2012; Hamada et al., 2012;\nL\u00f3pez-Alonso et al., 2014; Wiethoff et al., 2014). Of further inter-\nest in the present study, therefore, was to determine whether the\nresponsiveness to anodal tDCS is affected by age and explore\nwhether this inter-individual variation is associated with BDNF\ngenotype.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPARTICIPANTS\nForty healthy volunteers, consisting of 20 older adults recruited\nfrom the local community (7 males, 13 females, age M = 68.3,\nSD = 7.9 years) and 20 young adults recruited from stu-\ndents at the University of Tasmania (10 males, 10 females, age\nM = 22.7, SD = 3.3 years), participated in the study. Within\nthe older group, participants had similar socio-economic sta-\ntus and were involved in active social activities and/or paid\nemployment. All participants completed at least high school\neducation. The Mini-Mental State Examination (Dick et al.,\n1984) was used to screen for cognitive de\ufb01cits in the sam-\nple of older adults. All participants scored within the normal\nrange (score \u226526) and were free of any neurological, symp-\ntomatic cardiovascular disease, diabetes or hypertension. Ethics\napproval for the study was obtained from the Human Research\nEthics (Tasmania) Network and written informed consent was\nobtained prior to participation in the study. All participants\nwere screened for contra-indications to TMS. We also consid-\nered the effect of physical activity on the response to tDCS.\nParticipants completed the International Physical Activity Ques-\ntionnaire (IPAQ) which assesses the amount of time during\nthe previous seven days spent engaging in a range of physical\nactivities. The IPAQ has been shown to produce reliable and\nrepeatable measures of physical activities in young (Craig et al.,\n2003; Hagstromer et al., 2006) and older adults (Tomioka et al.,\n2011).\nBDNF GENOTYPING\nThree young and one older participant did not feel com-\nfortable undergoing the characterization of the genotype.\nThe remaining 36 participants gave written informed con-\nsent prior to participation in the DNA sampling. ARMS-PCR\n(Sheikh et al., 2010) was performed to amplify the BDNF gene\nregion containing rs6265.\nUsing the four primers P1 for-\nward CCTACAGTTCCACCAGGTGAGAAGAGTG, P2 (reverse)\nTCATGGACATGTTTGCAGCATCTAGGTA, P3 (G allele speci\ufb01c)\nCTGGTCCTCATCCAACAGCTCTTCTATAAC and P4 (A allele\nspeci\ufb01c) ATCATTGGCTGACACTTTCGAACCCA we could dis-\ntinguish two allele speci\ufb01c amplicons 253 bp (val) and/or 201 bp\n(met) along with the 401 bp amplicon (entire rs6265 region\nas internal control). The ARMS-PCR reaction was carried out\nin a total volume of 12 \u03bcl containing 1\u00d7 REDExtract-N-\nAmpTM PCR ReadyMixTM (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 1 \u03bcM of\neach of the four primers (P1, P2, P3, and P4) and 10 ng\nof genomic DNA. Thermocycling conditions were:\ndenatu-\nration at 94\u25e6C for 3 min,\n30 cycles of 95\u25e6C for 45 s,\n62\u25e6C for 60 s and 72\u25e6C for 60 s,\nwith a \ufb01nal exten-\nsion at 72\u25e6C for 2 min.\nARMS-PCR products were then\nresolved on a 4% agarose gel. The samples could then be\nclassi\ufb01ed as Val/Val (253/253 bp), Val/Met (253/201 bp), or\nMet/Met (201/201 bp) based on the observed banding pat-\ntern.\nAll samples should have the rs6265 internal control\n(401 bp) band present. Every sample was genotyped from at\nleast two independent PCR reactions to ensure \ufb01delity. Par-\nticipants were divided into two groups according to their\ngenotype, either (i) homozygous for the val allele (Val/Val)\nor (ii) homozygous and heterozygous for the Met allele\n(Met/Met, Val/Met), respectively. Participants and examiner were\nblinded with respect to the genotype at the time of examina-\ntion.\nTMS PROCEDURE AND EMG RECORDING\nTMS was used to compare corticospinal excitability of projections\nfrom the cortical representation of the right forearm \ufb02exor, \ufb02exor\ncarpi radialis (FCR),within the left M1, before (baseline), immedi-\nately after and at 10, 20, and 30 min intervals following tDCS (see\nTranscranial Direct Current Stimulation section below). Single-\npulse TMS was applied using a standard \ufb01gure of eight coil (7 cm\ndiameter of each wing) connected to a Magstim 200 (Magstim\nCompany, Dyfed, UK). The TMS coil was held tangentially over\nthe scalp to induce a posterior\u2013anterior current \ufb02ow and to opti-\nmally elicit MEPs in the right FCR. We chose a forearm \ufb02exor\nmuscle rather than an intrinsic hand muscle, as proximal muscles\nof the upper limb are often the targets of rehabilitation (Carson\net al., 2013). EMG surface electrodes (Ag/AgCl) were placed over\nthe right FCR in a belly tendon montage and signals were ampli\ufb01ed\nwith a gain of 1000, band pass \ufb01ltered (10\u2013500 Hz) and sampled\nat 2000 Hz using a 16-bit AD system (CED 1902, Cambridge, UK).\nEMG data were fed to disk for of\ufb02ine analysis. At the beginning\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience\nwww.frontiersin.org\nJune 2014 | Volume 6 | Article 115 | 2\nFujiyama et al.\nIs aging brain plastic?\nof each session each individual\u2019s resting motor threshold (rMT)\nwas determined as the lowest intensity that evoked MEPs of greater\nthan 50 \u03bcV in at least three out of \ufb01ve consecutive trials for the FCR\n(e.g., Carroll et al.,2008). The optimal scalp position for induction\nof MEPs in the right FCR was marked on the participant\u2019s head\nusing a felt tip pen. With both upper limbs relaxed and resting on\na pillow in the participant\u2019s lap, baseline MEP recruitment curves\nwere constructed by applying stimuli in steps of 10% between 90%\nand 160% of rMT. At each intensity, six pulses were delivered with\nan inter-stimulus interval of 5 s (Carson et al., 2013); thus each\nrecruitment curve took approximately 4 min to collect. For thirty\nparticipants, the order of stimulus intensities was randomized;\nhowever, due to a technical problem, for the 10 participants (\ufb01ve\nmales), the randomization of intensities was replaced with coun-\nterbalanced intensity steps. As no differences between recruitment\ncurves obtained in a ramping (systematically increased stimu-\nlus intensity) and random manner have been observed (Pearce\net al., 2013), it is unlikely that the changes to recruitment curve\nacquisition in\ufb02uenced the results obtained.\nTRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION (tDCS)\nThe direct current was generated by a battery-driven constant-\ndirect current stimulator (Magstim Company, Dyfed, UK).\nThe current was delivered to the participant through anodal\n(5 cm \u00d7 5 cm) and cathodal (6 cm \u00d7 8.5 cm) conductive rub-\nber electrodes that were placed inside pre-saline soaked and gelled\nsponges with conductive gel. Following the baseline measure-\nment, either anodal stimulation or sham stimulation was applied.\nThe anodal stimulation involved an initial two-second \u201cramp-\nup\u201d period during which the current was brought from 0 to\n1 mA. The current then remained at 1 mA for 30 min (Lin-\ndenberg et al., 2013). The sham stimulation involved the same\ninitial ramp. However, the current was then immediately ramped\ndown to zero over a 30 s period (Nitsche et al., 2008). The\nparticipants were blinded to tDCS conditions and were instructed\nin both sessions that they may feel a mild itching sensation\nunder the electrodes. That is, the participants were led to believe\nthey were receiving tDCS in both sessions (Kessler et al., 2012).\nFor both anodal tDCS and sham conditions the center of the\nanodal electrode was placed over the FCR representation in the\nleft primary motor cortex, the location of which was identi\ufb01ed\nin the initial setup phase of the experiment, while the catho-\ndal electrode was positioned over the contralateral supraorbital\nregion.\nPROCEDURE\nParticipants received sham and anodal tDCS in two separate ses-\nsions, one week apart at a similar time of day. The order of sham\nand anodal tDCS was counterbalanced across participants. Dur-\ning each session the participants were comfortably seated in a chair\nwith their left arm supported and stabilized on a pillow with the\nelbow in a semi-\ufb02exed position to ensure no muscle activations\nin the forearm and hand muscles. After establishing the rMT, the\nbaseline MEP recruitment curve was recorded. This was followed\nby 30 min of either sham or anodal tDCS. MEP recruitment curves\nwere then obtained immediately (0 min), 10, 20, and 30 min after\ncessation of tDCS (Figure 1).\nDATA PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS\nIn presenting the results,\nthe data are expressed as mean\n(M) \u00b1 95% con\ufb01dence intervals (CI). Using spearman\u2019s bivariate\ncorrelations we investigated whether IPAQ score was linearly cor-\nrelated with normalized area under the recruitment curve (AURC)\nvalues. We also considered gender in responses to tDCS, given\nthat there is evidence that PAS-induced neuroplasticity may be\nreduced in older females (Tecchio et al., 2008). Resting motor\nthresholds were examined by a 2(AGE: Young, Older) \u00d7 2(SEX:\nmale, female) \u00d7 2(GENOTYPE:Val66Val, met-carrier) \u00d7 2(STIM:\nanodal tDCS, Sham) repeated measures ANOVA.\nFIGURE 1 | Example of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) evoked in the right \ufb02exor carpi radialis (FCR) at pre and post (0, 10, 20, and 30 min) anodal\ntDCS from a typical young (top) and older (bottom) participant.

Trials in which root mean square (RMS) EMG\nexceeded 10 \u03bcV (Carson et al.,2004) during the 40 ms immediately\npreceding the TMS pulse were discarded. The mean MEP ampli-\ntude at each intensity and time point was then used to calculate\nthe AURC for each time point. The curve was bounded by TMS\nintensity using the trapezoidal rule (Potteiger et al., 2002; Carson\net al., 2013). More speci\ufb01cally, the following formula was used,\n\u0002 10(a+b)\n2\n,wherea andb representMEPamplitudesatconsecutive\nstimulus intensities, e.g., 90% rMT and 100% rMT. AURC for each\npost-stimulation time point was then normalized for each partici-\npant to AURC obtained at the baseline pre stimulation (anodal or\nsham) for that participant.\nA mixed factorial ANOVA was undertaken to assess post-\nstimulation normalized AURC (dependent variable) using AGE\n(Young, Older), SEX (Male, Female), GENOTYPE (Val66Val, met-\ncarrier), STIM (anodal tDCS, Sham), and TIME (post 0, post\n10, post 20, post 30) as independent variables. If the sphericity\nassumption was violated, Greenhouse-Geisser\u2019s degrees of free-\ndom adjustment was applied. Planned contrasts between groups\n(AGE, SEX, and GENOTYPE) at each time point and across\ntime points for each group separately were conducted to explore\nsigni\ufb01cant main and interaction effects.\nWe performed chi-square tests to evaluate the percentage of\nresponders and non-responders in two groups divided on the basis\nof BDNF, age, or sex. Non-responders were de\ufb01ned operationally\naccording to the ratio between pre and grand average of the post-\nanodal tDCS AURC values across time points (post 0, 10, 20,\nand 30) below 1 (Hamada et al., 2012). We chose this criterion to\naccept any increases in AURC as a possible neuroplastic response\nto anodal tDCS.\nThe critical p-value was set at 0.05.

The BDNF genotype\nanalysis for the remaining 35 participants for whom we had\ngenetic data revealed that 24 were homozygous for the Val allele\n(Val66Val), while 11 were Met-carriers including seven Val66Met\nheterozygotes and four homozygous for the Met allele.\nRESTING MOTOR THRESHOLD\nResting motor threshold (de\ufb01ned as a percentage of maxi-\nmum stimulator output) was signi\ufb01cantly higher in Met car-\nriers (51.27 \u00b1 3.25%) than Val66Val group (46.48 \u00b1 2.01%),\nF1,30 = 4.83, p = 0.04, \u03b72\np= 0.14. rMTs did not vary reli-\nably as a function of age group (Young, 48.37 \u00b1 2.87%; Older,\nTable 1 | Summary of demographic information and BDNF genotype.\nAge\nSex\nBDNF genotype\u2217\nM \u00b1 SD\nMale\nFemale\nVal66val\nVal66Met\nMat66Met\nYoung\n22.7 \u00b1 3.2\n11\n9\n11\n3\n2\nOlder\n68.3 \u00b1 7.9\n7\n13\n13\n4\n2\n\u2217Three young and one older participant did not consent to genotype determina-\ntion.\n49.10 \u00b1 2.03%) or session (anodal, 48.63 \u00b1 2.32%; sham,\n48.93 \u00b1 2.49%), Fs < 0.91, ps > 0.34, \u03b72\np = 0.02.\nTHE EFFECT OF AGE AND GENOTYPE ON PLASTICITY INDUCED BY\nANODAL tDCS\nRepeated measures ANOVA for normalized AURC data revealed\nthat there was a main effect of STIM, F1,30 = 4.97, p = 0.03,\n\u03b72\np = 0.12, indicating, as expected, that the increase in AURC\ninduced by anodal tDCS (1.34 \u00b1 0.16; +34%, signi\ufb01cant increase,\np < 0.001, d = 0.70) was signi\ufb01cantly larger than AURC changes\nfollowing sham tDCS (1.14 \u00b1 0.16). The main effect of AGE\nwas not signi\ufb01cant, F1,30 = 0.11, p = 0.74, \u03b72\np = 0.002, indi-\ncating that overall the magnitude of changes in post-tDCS AURC\nvalues were not statistically different between young and older\nadults. However, young and older adults showed different pat-\nterns in the modulation of AURC post-tDCS as indicated by a\nsigni\ufb01cant interaction of AGE x TIME, F3,90 = 4.68, p = 0.004,\n\u03b72\np = 0.11, which is best interpreted with reference to the signi\ufb01-\ncant three-way interaction of AGE x STIM x TIME, F3,90 = 2.84,\np = 0.04, \u03b72\np = 0.07. For young adults, although within the\nanodal condition AURC values were not signi\ufb01cantly differ-\nent between the different time points (ps > 0.17, ds < 0.32),\nAURC values at only post 0 and post 10 following tDCS were\nsigni\ufb01cantly higher than respective time points in the sham\ncondition (ps < 0.008, ds > 0.41). A different response pat-\ntern was observed in older adults with AURC values at post\n20 (1.40 \u00b1 0.33) and post 30 (1.53 \u00b1 0.35) being signi\ufb01cantly\nhigher than post 0 (1.04 \u00b1 0.14) and post 10 (1.13 \u00b1 0.20;\nps < 0.02, ds > 0.58) as well as at the respective post-sham time\npoints (ps < 0.02, ds > 0.34; Figure 2). Within the sham con-\ndition, AURC values at each time point were not signi\ufb01cantly\ndifferent, ps > 0.13, ds < 0.22. Finally, an important \ufb01nd-\ning was that the only between-group difference was observed\nat post 0 where the AURC value in young adults was signif-\nicantly larger than the value obtained for older adults at that\ntime point (p = 0.01, d = 0.85; Figure 2). Thus, the interaction\nbetween AGE and TIME was predominantly driven by older group\nshowing AURC value changes in time-dependent manner (i.e.,\ndelayed response to anodal stimulation), whereas the responses\nin young group were unchanged across time points following\nstimulation.\nInterestingly, all main effects and interactions including SEX\nand/orBDNFasafactorwerenotstatisticallysigni\ufb01cant,Fs<1.47,\nps > 0.23, \u03b72\np < 0.04, and all were associated with small effect\nsizes, suggesting that these factors may not be associated with the\nneuroplastic changes following anodal tDCS.\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience\nwww.frontiersin.org\nJune 2014 | Volume 6 | Article 115 | 4\nFujiyama et al.\nIs aging brain plastic?\nFIGURE 2 | Mean normalized AURC for young and older adults across post-stimulation [(A) anodal tDCS and (B) sham] time points.

Asterisks indicate a signi\ufb01cant\ndifference between groups (**p < 0.01).\nINTER-INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY OF RESPONSES TO ANODAL tDCS\nInspection of each individual\u2019s data revealed that despite group\neffects indicating a signi\ufb01cant effect of stimulation, there were\nsome individuals who did not display the anticipated increase in\nAURC following anodal tDCS (Figure 3). Approximately 20% of\ntotal participants, speci\ufb01cally four young (two males, two females,\nM = 24.5, SD = 3.3 years) and four older females (M = 69.0,\nSD = 9.3 years), were identi\ufb01ed as non-responders exhibit-\ning AURC values across post-anodal tDCS time points below\n1. Responders consisted of 16 (seven males and nine females)\nolder adults (age range: 60\u201388 years, M = 67.7, SD = 7.8)\nand 15 young (nine males and six females) participants (age\nrange: 19\u201329 years, M = 23.0, SD = 3.1). Response to anodal\ntDCS did not differ by BDNF genotype (17 Val66Val and 10\nMet-carriers in responders), \u03c72(1, N = 35) = 1.72, p = 0.19,\nV = 0.22, age, \u03c72(1, N = 39) = 0.01, p = 0.94, V = 0.01,\nor sex, \u03c72(1, N = 39) = 0.82, p = 0.37, V = 0.15. In non-\nresponders, normalized AURC values between anodal and sham\nconditions at each time point were not statistically different\n(ps > 0.16, ds < 0.41). In both older and younger respon-\nders, there were no signi\ufb01cant correlations between total IPAQ\nscore and AURC values at any time point following anodal tDCS\n(rs < 0.38, ps > 0.16). Physical activity, therefore, did not appear\nto be associated with corticospinal excitability changes induced\nby tDCS.\nDISCUSSION\nThe present study was designed to investigate the age-related\nchanges in the extent of neural plasticity of the corticospinal pro-\njections from primary M1 in response to anodal tDCS. For young\nFIGURE 3 | Mean (black square with error bars denoting SD) and individual AURC ratios (pooled AURC across post-time points divided by baseline\npre stimulation) in the anodal tDCS condition for young and older adults.

Although\nAURC values were not signi\ufb01cantly different between the post-\nstimulation time points, only up to 10 min post-anodal tDCS\nshowed signi\ufb01cantly higher corticospinal excitability than sham\ncondition. Although this result is inconsistent with a recent \ufb01nd-\ning (Monte-Silva et al., 2013), in which a reduction in corticospinal\nexcitability relative to baseline was observed following a 26 min\nperiod of anodal stimulation, consistent with the present data is\na report of increased corticospinal excitability following a 40 min\nbout of anodal tDCS (Williams et al., 2010). Although we believe\nit is extremely unlikely that the single-blinded approach utilized\nin the current study affected the results, it may be desirable to\nuse double-blinded approach in the future studies to remove the\npossibility of any confound.\nFor older adults, in contrast, post-stimulation potentiation was\ndelayed with the largest response occurring 30 min after the stim-\nulation. Indeed, potentiation immediately after stimulation and\n10 min thereafter was signi\ufb01cantly different to neither sham nor\nbaseline. Importantly, neither BDNF nor sex appeared to in\ufb02uence\nthe neuroplastic changes induced by anodal tDCS. In light of this\n\ufb01nding, implications for the use of tDCS in older populations are\ndiscussed below.\nDELAYED INCREASE IN CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY FOLLOWING\nANODAL tDCS IN OLDER ADULTS\nWe found that the magnitude of anodal tDCS-induced plasticity\nin older adults was not signi\ufb01cantly reduced (as inferred by way of\ninferential statistics) relative to young adults. Although the aver-\nage level of potentiation (averaged over the four post-tDCS time\npoints) was lower in older adults (29% relative to pre-stimulation\nlevels) than younger adults (41%), the difference was not statisti-\ncally signi\ufb01cant. What was most striking, however, was our novel,\nand potentially important, \ufb01nding that older adults exhibited a\ndelayed response to anodal tDCS relative to young adults. As seen\nin Figure 2, corticospinal excitability in older adults did not peak\nuntil 30 min after cessation of stimulation, whereas young adults\nexhibited their peak potentiation immediately following stimula-\ntion. Indeed, at 0 and 10 min after tDCS older adults\u2019corticospinal\nexcitability was not different from baseline, while young adults\nshowed signi\ufb01cant potentiation at these early time points. At 20\nand 30 min post-anodal tDCS both groups exhibited signi\ufb01cant\npotentiation relative to baseline.\nA number of previous studies have reported a decreased capac-\nity for neuroplastic changes within the motor network with\nadvancing age, both in response to motor training (Sawaki et al.,\n2003; Rogasch et al., 2009 ) and in response to NIBS techniques\nincluding PAS (Fathi et al., 2010) and repetitive TMS (rTMS;\nM\u00fcller-Dahlhaus et al., 2008; Fathi et al., 2010; Todd et al., 2010).\nWhile PAS and rTMS, including theta burst stimulation (TBS),\nprotocols are thought to elicit LTP- or LTD-like plasticity by\nchanging NMDA-dependent glutamatergic transmission (Stefan\net al., 2000; Wolters et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2005, 2007; Zie-\nmann et al., 2008), tDCS in\ufb02uences resting membrane potentials\nby affecting sodium and calcium channels or by shifting electri-\ncal gradients which in\ufb02uence the electrical balance of ions across\nthe neural membrane (Liebetanz et al., 2002). It could therefore\nbe the case that the delayed, but not diminished, tDCS-induced\nplastic changes evident in older adults is a result of the stimula-\ntion targeting different plasticity mechanisms than those targeted\nby rTMS, TBS and PAS, where age-related declines in plasticity\nhave been observed. That said, it must be noted that age-related\ndecline in plasticity is not a ubiquitous \ufb01nding, as a number of\npapers indicate preserved neural plasticity in response to motor\ntraining (Cirillo et al., 2010, 2011; Hinder et al., 2011, 2013a,b) or\nNIBS paradigms (e.g., TBS; Di Lazzaro et al., 2008). These dis-\ncrepancies between individual studies may perhaps re\ufb02ect large\ninter-individual variability in response to training programs or\nbrain stimulation interventions.\nVARIABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS\u2019 RESPONSE TO tDCS\nConsistent with recent reports using tDCS (Datta et al., 2012;\nL\u00f3pez-Alonso et al., 2014; Wiethoff et al., 2014), rTMS (Maeda\net al., 2000; Hamada et al., 2012; L\u00f3pez-Alonso et al., 2014), and\nPAS (M\u00fcller-Dahlhaus et al., 2008; L\u00f3pez-Alonso et al., 2014), we\nobserved that a number (8 out of 39, or approximately 20% of par-\nticipants) of participants did not show the expected corticospinal\nexcitablity increase following anodal tDCS. The aftereffects of\nrTMS protocols including TBS have also been reported to be\nhighly variable between individuals, irrespective of age (Hamada\net al., 2012). As a consequence, some recent studies have separated\nparticipants into responders and non-responders (e.g., M\u00fcller-\nDahlhaus et al., 2008; Hamada et al., 2012). It should be noted that\nall those participants in the current study who exhibited reduc-\ntions in excitability following anodal tDCS lie within 2 SDs of\nthe mean response for their age group. As such, given a spread\nof responses within a normal distribution, it might be that these\nparticipants did not necessarily display atypical responses. That is,\nthere was not a bimodal distribution in the present data re\ufb02ecting\nthose individuals who responded to tDCS in the expected manner,\nand those who showed the opposite effect. We suggest, therefore,\nthat rather than indicating a clear pattern of \u201cresponders\u201d and\n\u201cnon-responders,\u201d the present data indicate variability around the\nexpected response.\nRecently, it has been hypothesized that the inter-individual\nvariability in response to NIBS may be the result of different popu-\nlations of neurons being stimulated more easily in different people\nat different times (Hamada et al., 2012). Variability in the response\nto TMS may not be due to differences between individuals in the\nplasticity of cortical synapses, but instead may result from indi-\nvidual differences in the recruitment of cortical neurons (Hamada\net al., 2012). Furthermore, recent modeling analysis has shown\nthat the current \ufb02owing from anodal tDCS is highly in\ufb02uenced by\nvariations in cortical gyri/sulci, suggesting that the effects may not\nbe homogeneous throughout the stimulated area for an individual\nand depend on the anatomical characteristics in the individual M1\n(Datta et al., 2012). Therefore, the observed variability to anodal\nstimulation in the present study could, at least in part, be explained\nby individual differences in the anatomical structure of the brain.\nIn addition, we cannot rule out a possibility that other factors\nplayed roles in the inter-individual variability in the response to\nanodal stimulation. Since, for example, emotional states (Baum-\ngartner et al., 2007; Coombes et al., 2009) and motor activities\n(Koeneke et al., 2006) modulate corticospinal excitability, it may\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience\nwww.frontiersin.org\nJune 2014 | Volume 6 | Article 115 | 6\nFujiyama et al.\nIs aging brain plastic?\nbe useful to apply a questionnaire to investigate emotional state\nand activities prior to the assessment.\nWe also examined whether BDNF gene polymorphism affects\nthe ef\ufb01cacy of anodal tDCS to induce plasticity. In the human\nbrain, BDNF is thought to modulate NMDA receptor-dependent\nLTP and LTD (Antal et al., 2010). Neuronal activity in response\nto experience and environmental demand appears to enhance\nthe local synthesis/secretion of neurotrophins, which in turn\nregulates synaptic ef\ufb01cacy or growth (Rossini et al., 2007). In\ncontrast to Antal et al. (2010), we did not \ufb01nd that individu-\nals carrying the Val66Met polymorphism had enhanced anodal\ntDCS-induced plasticity compared to Val66Val carriers. Rather,\nour results are consistent with two previous studies showing no\ndifference between BDNF genotypes with regard to corticospinal\nexcitability changes following cathodal tDCS over M1 (Cheeran\net al., 2008; Di Lazzaro et al., 2012). In the present study, the only\ngroup difference observed was in rMT, with Met carriers showing\nsigni\ufb01cantly higher rMT than theVal66Val group. Similarly, we did\nnot \ufb01nd any sex difference in response to anodal tDCS. Although\nthe present sample was larger than previous studies examining the\nrelationshipbetweenNIBSinducedplasticityandBDNFgenotype,\nstudies using much larger sample sizes with a balanced number of\nparticipants across the polymorphism are clearly required before\na de\ufb01nite conclusion can be drawn regarding the impact of BDNF\non neuroplasticity mechanisms.\nPOSSIBLE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING DELAYED RESPONSE TO tDCS\nAND IMPLICATIONS\nAlthough the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the\ndelayed response to anodal stimulation in older adults are\nunknown, one possibility is that deterioration at the microstruc-\ntural level in the aging brain may contribute to the delayed\nresponse. During aging there is progressive accumulation of dam-\naged molecules and impaired energy metabolism in brain cells (Yu\net al., 2002). The aging process compromises neuroprotective and\nneurorestorative mechanisms involving glial cells (Yu et al., 2002).\nRecently, it has been speculated that tDCS may affect glial cells\nrather than neurons directly (Ruohonen and Karhu, 2012). There-\nfore, the degradation process with advancing age in glial cells may\nbe associated with the delayed response to anodal stimulation in\nolder adults. The next important question is whether the observed\nresponse to anodal tDCS in older adults is as long lasting as the\nincreased corticospinal excitability relative to baseline in young\nadults which persisted for up to 30 min after the stimulation.\nRecent studies investigating the effect of tDCS on motor learn-\ning have utilized a \u201cgating\u201d strategy in which the excitability of\nM1 is transiently increased via DC stimulation concurrent with\nmotor task performance(Ziemann and Siebner, 2008). In gating\nstudies, tDCS is often applied at the initial stage of the learning\n(e.g.,Waters-Metenier et al.,2014). Given that older adults showed\ndelayed potentiation in corticospinal excitability, it may be worth\nconsidering the application of stimulation prior to motor training\nin older adults to elicit greatest changes in behavior during motor\nperformance.\nIn summary, young adults exhibited the largest potentiation in\ncorticospinal excitability immediately after the anodal tDCS,while\nthe potentiation in corticospinal excitability was delayed in older\nadults. Notably, we failed to observe differences in neuroplastic\nchanges following atDCS by BDNF subtypes and sex, suggesting\nneuroplastic response following atDCS is possibly independent\nfrom these factors. Future work is warranted to investigate the\nassociation between neuroplasticity induced by NIBS techniques\nand skill acquisition in older adults. Further understanding of\nthe neurophysiological mechanisms underlying neuroplasticity in\nolder adults has signi\ufb01cant clinical implications for the improving\nof motor function in aging populations and recovery following\nstroke.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research was supported under Australian Research Coun-\ncil (ARC)\u2019s Discovery Projects funding scheme (DP0770568).\nMark Hinder is supported by an ARC DECRA fellowship\n(DE120100729).

However, outside of dietary shifts, other potential environmental drivers of gut\nmicrobial composition have rarely been investigated, particularly in organisms living in their natural environments.\nResults: Here, we generated the largest wild nonhuman primate gut microbiome dataset to date to identify the\nenvironmental drivers of gut microbial diversity and function in 758 samples collected from wild Ethiopian geladas\n(Theropithecus gelada). Because geladas live in a cold, high-altitude environment and have a low-quality grass-based\ndiet, they face extreme thermoregulatory and energetic constraints. We tested how proxies of food availability\n(rainfall) and thermoregulatory stress (temperature) predicted gut microbiome composition of geladas. The gelada\ngut microbiome composition covaried with rainfall and temperature in a pattern that suggests distinct responses to\ndietary and thermoregulatory challenges. Microbial changes were driven by differences in the main components of\nthe diet across seasons: in rainier periods, the gut was dominated by cellulolytic/fermentative bacteria that\nspecialized in digesting grass, while during dry periods the gut was dominated by bacteria that break down\nstarches found in underground plant parts. Temperature had a comparatively smaller, but detectable, effect on the\ngut microbiome. During cold and dry periods, bacterial genes involved in energy, amino acid, and lipid metabolism\nincreased, suggesting a stimulation of fermentation activity in the gut when thermoregulatory and nutritional stress\nco-occurred, and potentially helping geladas to maintain energy balance during challenging periods.\nConclusion: Together, these results shed light on the extent to which gut microbiota plasticity provides dietary\nand metabolic flexibility to the host, and might be a key factor to thriving in changing environments. On a longer\nevolutionary timescale, such metabolic flexibility provided by the gut microbiome may have also allowed members\nof Theropithecus to adopt a specialized diet, and colonize new high-altitude grassland habitats in East Africa.\nKeywords: Gut microbiome, Graminivory, Seasonality, Thermoregulation, Theropithecus gelada, Primates\n\u00a9 The Author(s). 2021 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License,\nwhich permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give\nappropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if\nchanges were made.

Microbiome            (2021) 9:26 \nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-020-00977-9\nBackground\nObtaining sufficient nutrients is a fundamental challenge\nfor most animals. Yet, the availability and nutritional\ncontent of food can vary temporally and spatially in re-\nsponse to changes in climate and geography. Nutritional\ndemands further vary in response to thermoregulatory\nneeds and life history processes, such as growth and\nreproduction [1, 2]. Animals have evolved a variety of\nbehavioral and physiological strategies to cope with\nthese shifting demands, including altered feeding and ac-\ntivity patterns and increased mobilization of stored fat to\nfuel energetic demands [3\u20136]. Recently, the gut micro-\nbiome has been proposed as an additional avenue by\nwhich animals can cope with changing dietary land-\nscapes and energetic challenges [7\u20139]. The gastrointes-\ntinal\ntract\nof\nanimals\nharbors\na\ndense\nmicrobial\ncommunity that helps to break down and ferment plant\nstructural carbohydrates, producing short-chain fatty\nacids (SCFAs) that can be used as an energy source by\nhosts [10\u201312]. The absorption of SCFAs in the gut may\nbe particularly important for herbivorous species, such\nas foregut and hindgut fermenters, which obtain as\nmuch as 40-90% of their energy requirements from bac-\nterial degradation of complex plant polysaccharides [13\u2013\n16]. Additionally, variation in gut microbiome compos-\nition affects the efficiency of caloric harvest and the\nmetabolic programming of the host [11, 17\u201320]. For in-\nstance, in mice (Mus musculus) and humans, obese and\nlean individuals have strikingly different gut microbiota\ncomposition, with obese phenotypes being associated\nwith higher energy extraction from diet and increased\nlipogenesis [21\u201323].\nIn wild mammals, the gut microbiome responds rapidly\nto seasonal and dietary changes [7, 24\u201329], presumably to\nbuffer seasonal energetic challenges [7, 26]. For example, a\nsimultaneous increase in bacterial taxa involved in fiber\nfermentation and in SCFA concentrations during the dry\nseason\nmay\nallow\nMexican\nblack\nhowler\nmonkeys\n(Alouatta pigra) to maintain energy balance during ener-\ngetic shortfalls without changes in activity or ranging pat-\nterns [7]. Moreover, gut bacteria increase intestinal\nabsorptive capacity, energy homeostasis, and fat burning\nduring cold periods in mice [30], and improve digestive ef-\nficiency and SCFA production in energetically challenged\nruminants living in cold environments and at high-\naltitude [31, 32]. These microbial shifts likely come at\nsome cost. For instance, increases in microbes that im-\nprove host metabolism under certain conditions may re-\nduce the abundance of microbes that support host\nimmune function [33, 34]. However, in seasonal and nutri-\ntionally challenging environments, enduring these trade-\noffs may be necessary for host survival and reproduction.\nGeladas (Theropithecus gelada) represent an excellent\nsystem to\ninvestigate\nthe\nrelationship between gut\nmicrobiota composition and seasonal variation in host\ndiet and energy needs. Despite being the only graminiv-\norous primate with up to 90% of their diet comprised of\ngrass [35, 36], their gastrointestinal tract appears poorly\nadapted to this specialization (but see [37, 38] for dental,\nmanual, and locomotor adaptations), closely resembling\ntheir\nclosest\nphylogenetic\nrelatives,\nbaboons\n(Papio\nspp.)\u2014a taxon that is omnivorous [39]. To compensate,\ngeladas may rely heavily on their gut microbiota to\nmaximize\nnutrient\nextraction\nfrom\ngrasses,\nlikely\nthrough hindgut fermentation [39, 40]. Moreover, gela-\ndas live in a high-altitude, energetically demanding en-\nvironment that exhibits marked inter- and intra-annual\nfluctuation in rainfall and temperature [35, 41]. During\nrainier months, when grass is abundant, they forage al-\nmost exclusively on aboveground graminoid leaves and\nseeds, and during drier months, when grass availability\ndecreases, they shift heavily to underground foods (rhi-\nzomes, roots, corms, bulbs) [35, 42]. This diet provides\ndistinct challenges. Underground foods are considered a\nfallback food for geladas since they take additional time\nand effort to harvest, are harder to process, and are re-\nlied upon only when grasses are less abundant [35, 38].\nDespite being considered a fallback food, these under-\nground foods are rich in starches and carbohydrates,\nsuggesting that they contain more nutritional energy\nthan grass [43]. This high amount of energy, however,\ncomes at some cost: roots and rhizomes are generally\nhigher in fibers and lignin\u2014and thus harder to digest\nthan grasses. In addition to these nutritional challenges,\nambient temperatures frequently drop to near freezing,\nand the metabolic costs of thermoregulation are known\nto strongly influence gelada physiology [44] and the tim-\ning of reproduction [41, 45]. Thus, seasonal dietary shifts\nand temperature variation may lead to distinct digestive\nand thermoregulatory challenges.\nOne previous study on geladas from Guassa, Ethiopia,\nfound that gut microbial communities of adult females\nshifted across seasons [40], supporting the hypothesis\nthat the gut microbiome may help hosts confront envir-\nonmental challenges. This study focused on adult fe-\nmales and assessed seasonal variation by separating the\nsamples into two categorical seasons (i.e., rainy, dry).\nOur study expands on this study by including adult\nmales, incorporating continuous climatic data across\nseveral years, and examining proxies of thermoregulatory\nstress (in addition to diet) as factors that can influence\nthe composition and function of the gelada gut micro-\nbiome. Indeed, rainfall and temperature vary independ-\nently of each other and represent distinct ecological\nchallenges in gelada ecosystems. Therefore, we were\ninterested in further testing which aspect of gelada\necology more strongly determines seasonal microbiome\nshifts.\nBaniel et al. Microbiome            (2021) 9:26 \nPage 2 of 20\nWe analyzed the gut microbiome composition and\npredicted microbiome function in 758 fecal samples\nacross 5 years from 48 adult male and 86 adult female\ngeladas living in the Ethiopian highlands in the Simien\nMountains\nNational\nPark.\nThe\nSimien\nMountains\nGelada Research Project (SMGRP) has been collecting\ndetailed climatologic, demographic, and behavioral data\nfrom this study population since 2006, allowing us to\nexamine how ecological (rainfall and temperature) and\nindividual (group membership, sex, reproductive status,\nand age) factors influence gelada gut microbiome com-\nposition. We hypothesized that ecological factors would\nbe more strongly associated with variation in the gelada\nmicrobiome than individual factors, and that rainfall and\ntemperature would have independent effects. In particu-\nlar, we expected that rainfall, which is a good proxy for\ngrass availability [35], would have the strongest effect on\nthe gelada gut microbiome. We predicted that the taxo-\nnomic changes associated with rainfall would mainly re-\nflect a shift to grass-based versus underground food-\nbased diet, in order to allow individuals to maximize en-\nergy extraction from those seasonal foods. We found\nthat the gelada microbiome exhibited drastic shifts re-\nlated to climatological variables; but individual variables,\nlike age and sex, had minimal effects. Rainfall and\ntemperature exerted independent effects on the micro-\nbial composition and predicted function\u2014with rainfall\nhaving a stronger effect on the gelada gut microbiome.\nHigh rainfall, which is correlated with grass availability\n[35], was associated with more cellulolytic and fibrolytic\nbacterial taxa, when graminoid leaves were the main\nfood source. Dry periods, when geladas consume more\nunderground foods [35], were associated with more am-\nylolytic and methanogenic taxa. Cold periods were fur-\nther characterized by more amylolytic taxa, and hot\nperiods by more methanogenic taxa. In both drier and\ncolder periods, the gut microbiome shifted to predicted\nfunctions that suggested increased digestive efficiency,\nincluding energy, amino acid, and lipid metabolism.\nOverall, gelada gut microbial composition covaried with\ndiet and temperature in a pattern that suggests plastic but\ndistinct responses to dietary and metabolic challenges.\nResults\nThe gelada gut microbiome\nWe identified 3295 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs)\nin 758 fecal samples (mean \u00b1 SD = 813 \u00b1 243 ASVs per\nsample, range = 92-1730) using deep 16S rRNA gene\namplicon sequencing. Most ASVs could be taxonomic-\nally assigned to the phylum (100%), class (99%), and\norder level (99%), but assignments decreased substan-\ntially at the family (85%) and genus (61%) levels. These\n3295 ASVs came from 16 different phyla, 65 families,\nand 200 genera (Table S1, Fig. 1, Figures S1-S2). Of the\nFig. 1 Taxonomic composition of the gelada gut at the phylum and family levels. Relative abundance (a) of all bacterial phyla and (b) of the 24\nmost abundant families (relative abundance> 0.02%) in the gelada feces. The median and median absolute deviation (error limit) are represented\nin orange.\nBaniel et al. Microbiome            (2021) 9:26 \nPage 3 of 20\n3295 ASVs, 170 (5%) were present in at least 90% of\nsamples and form what can be considered the \u201ccore\nmicrobiota\u201d of geladas (Table S2). The four most abun-\ndant bacterial phyla were Firmicutes (32%), Kiritimatiel-\nlaeota (formerly called Verrucomicrobiota subdivision 5;\n26%), Bacteroidetes (23%), and Spirochaetes (5%) (Table\nS1, Fig. 1a). All microbes assigned to Kiritimatiellaeota\nwere part of the RFP12 family and represent almost one\nquarter of the gelada gut microbiome (mean 26%, range\n0.02-70%, Fig. 1b). Despite the abundance of RFP12, the\n78 ASVs belonging to this group could not be assigned\nbelow the family level. We therefore queried these se-\nquences against the NCBI database using BLAST [46, 47].\nThese RFP12 sequences were most similar (~ 97%) to bac-\nterial sequences previously found in the feces of hindgut\nherbivorous species (Asiatic elephant, domesticated horse,\nSomali wild ass, zebra, and black rhinoceros) [48] and, to\na lesser extent, the rumen of several foregut fermenters\n(cattle, yak, red kangaroo; Table S3). Taken together, this\nindicates that the RFP12 family is a key microbe for herb-\nivorous species, particularly hindgut fermenters, and likely\nplays an important fermentative role in plant digestion in\ngeladas. Other taxa found at high frequency in the guts of\nruminants and herbivorous hindgut fermenters were also\nprevalent in the gelada gut, including many cellulolytic/\nfibrolytic (13% Ruminococcaceae, 6% Lachnospiraceae, 4%\nClostridiales vadinBB60 group, 1.5% Fibrobacteraceae)\nand fermentative families (5.3% Rikenellaceae, 5% Prevo-\ntellaceae, 4.1% Bacteroidales F082) (Table S1, Fig. 1b and\nS1). The Spirochaetes phylum was mostly composed of\nTreponema (3.5%), a genus involved in lignocellulose deg-\nradation [49].\nDietary changes\nTo examine how seasonal variation in rainfall and\ntemperature was associated with changes in the gelada gut\nmicrobiome, we used measures of true climatic condi-\ntions, including monthly cumulative rainfall (an appropri-\nate proxy of grass availability in the Simiens: [35]) and\naverage monthly minimum temperature (a proxy of\nthermoregulatory constraint: [41, 44]). At the level of\nwithin-sample community diversity (\u201calpha diversity\u201d), we\nfound that cumulative rainfall was positively associated\nwith Shannon evenness (Table 1, Fig. 2a, c) but had no ef-\nfect on bacterial richness or Faith\u2019s phylogenetic diversity\n(Table S4, Figure S3). Thus, rainfall was associated with\nthe relative abundance of ASVs within a sample but not\nthe absolute number of ASVs or their phylogenetic\ndiversity.\nCumulative rainfall significantly explained 3.3% of the\noverall compositional dissimilarity\u2014or beta diversity\u2014\nbetween samples (as measured by Aitchison distance)\n(Table 2), which was less than that explained by two\ndemographic variables: individual identity and unit (so-\ncial group) membership (20% and 6%, respectively; Table\n2). The first principal component of beta diversity, which\nexplained 15% of variation, was strongly associated with\nrainfall (r = 0.43, t = 12.93, df = 756, p < 0.001, Fig. 2b).\nThe ASVs that loaded positively on PC1 (i.e., correlated\nwith higher rainfall, Fig. 2d) were primarily from the\nfamilies Prevotellaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnos-\npiraceae (Table S5 and S6). By contrast, the ASVs that\nloaded negatively on PC1 (i.e., more abundant in low\nrainfall, Fig. 2d) belonged to the family RFP12 and a dif-\nferent subset of Ruminococcaceae that were not abun-\ndant during the wet season (Table S5 and S6).\nCumulative rainfall predicted the relative abundance\nof gut microbes at all taxonomic levels and was signifi-\ncantly associated with the relative abundance of 63% of\nbacterial families tested (59-81% of taxa at other taxo-\nnomic levels, Fig. 3, Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p\nvalues: pBH < 0.05). Thus, across most taxa, there was a\nclear contrast in the relative abundance of gut bacteria\nbetween the wet and dry periods (Table S7, Fig. 4). In\nwetter periods, there was an increase in several import-\nant fermentative families from the Bacteroides order (in-\ncluding Prevotellaceae and Bacteroidaceae), as well as in\nseveral\ncellulolytic/fibrolytic\ntaxa\n(Lachnospiraceae,\nFibrobacteraceae, Spirochaetaceae, and several genera\nfrom the Ruminococcaceae; Figs. 4 and 5a), suggesting\nimproved digestive efficiency of plant cell wall polysac-\ncharides at a time when the gelada diet consists mainly\nof grasses. In particular, nine Prevotella genera as well as\nthe Bacteroides genus were at higher abundance during\nwetter periods than drier periods (Table S7, Fig. 4b).\nThere\nwas\nalso\nan\nincrease\nin\nseveral\nproficient\nTable 1 Determinants of alpha diversity, as measured by the Shannon index\nFixed factor\nEstimate\nSE\n95% confidence interval\nLRT\np value\nSex (male)\n\u22120.12\n0.04\n[\u22120.20; \u22120.05]\n9.27\n0.002\nAge\n0.01\n0.02\n[\u22120.02; 0.04]\n0.49\n0.484\nCumulative rainfall\n0.05\n0.02\n[0.02; 0.08]\n12.13\n< 0.001\nMinimum temperature\n0.00\n0.01\n[\u22120.03; 0.03]\n0.04\n0.848\nSequencing depth\n0.07\n0.01\n[0.04; 0.10]\n24.24\n< 0.001\nParameters and tests are based on linear mixed models of 758 samples and 131 individuals, controlling for individual identity and unit membership.

Microbiome            (2021) 9:26 \nPage 4 of 20\ncellulolytic genera (e.g., Senegalimassilia, Butyrivibrio,\nSaccharofermentans, Cellulosilyticum, Marvinbryantia)\n(Table S7, Fig. 4b). By contrast, the dry season was char-\nacterized by an increase in amylolytic genera (Succinivi-\nbrio;\nStreptococcus\nand\nPirellulaceae\np-1088-a5\ngut\ngroup), in several efficient sugar-fermenting families\n(Victivallales vadinBE97, Christensenellaceae), and in\nthe\nmethane-producer\nMethanobrevibacter,\na\ngenus\nknown to increase the rate of fermentation and digestive\nefficiency (Table S7, and Figs. 4 and 5b). Consistent with\nour beta diversity analyses, we also found an increase in\nthe relative abundance of the RFP12 family during the\ndry season (Table S7, Fig. 5b).\nThe taxonomic changes associated with rainfall also\ncorresponded to changes in the predicted function of\nthe gelada gut microbiome (as assessed by PICRUSt2:\n[50]). During wetter periods, functional changes tended\nto reflect the activity of the cellulolytic and fermentative\nbacterial taxa. Microbial pathways involved in the trans-\nport of molecules through bacterial membranes (e.g.,\nions, sugars, lipids, peptides), DNA replication and re-\npair, and cell motility (Tables S8-S9, Figs. 6, S4 and\nS5A) increased. We also found an increase in the metab-\nolism of sugars (e.g., starch and sucrose metabolism,\nfructose, mannose, and galactose) (Figure S4 and S5A).\nSuch activity probably reflects the exportation of sugar-\ncleaving enzymes and cellulosome complex across the\nouter membrane [12, 51] of fibrolytic bacteria (complex\npolysaccharides are too big to penetrate directly inside\nbacteria and have to be cleaved first) and the absorption\nof the soluble oligosaccharides back across the bacterial\nmembrane [12, 51].\nDuring drier periods, the gelada gut harbored a greater\nabundance of bacterial genes involved in energy, amino\nacid, and lipid metabolism (Tables S8-S9 and Fig. 6a, c).\nIn particular, cellular energy production and cellular\nFig. 2 Rainfall structures the gelada gut microbiome. a Partial residual plot of Shannon alpha diversity index according to cumulative rainfall (in mm).

Microbiome            (2021) 9:26 \nPage 5 of 20\nactivity were enhanced during this period, as evidenced\nby increases in pathways involved in the citric acid cycle,\noxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid synthesis and\nmetabolism (Figure S4 and S5B). Other energy metabol-\nism pathways also increased during drier periods, includ-\ning the methane pathway and the carbon fixation\npathways, which are important for generating energy in\nanaerobic bacteria (Figure S4 and S5B). Finally, drier\nperiods were associated with an increase in functions re-\nlated to the synthesis of proteinogenic amino acids (e.g.,\ntryptophan), the translation and synthesis of proteins\n(Figure S4), and the synthesis of lipopolysaccharide.\nNote, however, that the average weighted Nearest\nSequence Taxon Index (NSTI) value across all samples\n(a measure of how similar bacteria from a sample are to\nreference genome sequences) was relatively high in our\nsample (mean \u00b1 SD = 0.60 \u00b1 0.13) compared to other\nmammals [50]. Our results should therefore be inter-\npreted with caution, in that they provide a general idea\nof the predicted gene family profiles based on bacteria\nthat were functional characterized in previous studies.\nTemperature\nCompared to rainfall, minimum temperature had a\nmuch smaller impact on the gut microbiome. Average\nminimum temperature did not influence any metric of\nalpha diversity (Table 1 and S4, Figure S6A), and ex-\nplained only 0.33% of the variation in beta diversity\n(Table 2, Figure S6B). Changes in temperature were sig-\nnificantly associated with the relative abundance of 5%\nof the families (5-22% at other taxonomic levels; Fig. 3;\npBH < 0.05).

Across samples, however, sex explained\nlittle between-sample variation (i.e., < 1%) (Table 2, Fig-\nure S9B). We detected only a handful of bacterial taxa\nthat were differentially abundant according to sex (Table\nS7, Fig. 3). At the phylum level, females harbored more\nVerrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria (particularly from\nclass Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and\nAlphaproteobacteria). At the family and genus levels, fe-\nmales had more taxa involved in lactic acid metabolism\n(Lactobacillaceae, Anaerovibrio), cellulolysis (Saccharo-\nfermentans), and regulation of glucose and fat transport\n(Erysipelatoclostridium). Males, on the other hand, only\nharbored more Pirellulales. No predicted metabolic\npathway differed in abundance between males and\nfemales (Tables S8-S9).\nFemale reproductive state did not influence any alpha\ndiversity metric (Table S10, Figure S10A) and was not a\nsignificant factor influencing beta diversity between sam-\nples (Table S11, Figure S10B). Very few taxa were differ-\nentially abundant according to female reproductive state\n(Table S12 and S13). Pregnant females harbored more\nVerrucomicrobiota (class Verrucomicrobiae) and Epsilon-\nbacteraeota than cycling and lactating females (Table\nS13). In particular, the genus Helicobacter (within the\nfamily Epsiolonbacteroaeto)\u2014a presumed pathogen\u2014was\nhighly prevalent in pregnant females (Table S13).

First, the gelada gut micro-\nbiome was highly plastic and responded rapidly to sea-\nsonal fluctuations in climate\u2014particularly rainfall (a\nproxy for available foods). Second, an increase in pre-\ndicted bacterial functions involved in energy, amino acid,\nand lipid metabolism during both drier and colder pe-\nriods suggested increased production of SCFAs, and\nmore\nefficient\ndigestion\nduring\nenergetically\nand\nthermoregulatory challenging periods. We further found\nthat individual identity and social group explained nearly\na third of the variation of the gelada microbiome, while\nother individual traits such as sex, reproductive state,\nand age had little effect on gut microbiome composition\nand function.\nRainfall was the strongest ecological factor influencing\nchanges in the gelada gut microbiome, explaining ~ 3.3%\nof overall microbiome composition. In particular, cellu-\nlolytic/fibrolytic\nand\nfermentative\nbacterial\ntaxa\nin-\ncreased during wetter periods when grass, which is\nmostly composed of cellulose, was the primary food\nsource, while amylolytic and methanogenic bacterial taxa\nincreased during drier periods, when geladas incorpo-\nrated more starch (i.e., amylose) and lignified food into\ntheir diet. This effect of rainfall on the gut microbiome\nwas strong, despite the fact that geladas exhibit only\nmoderate dietary changes across season (i.e., from only\ngrass to less grass and more underground organs\u2014but\nfrom the same plant species) compared to other mam-\nmals living in more seasonal environments, e.g., that\nswitch from ripe fruits to more folivorous diets [7, 52,\n53]. This pattern highlights the importance of the gut\nmicrobiome for geladas in processing their unique diet\nacross seasons.\nThe efficiency of grass digestion in wet periods seems\nto rely on a syntropy between the first cellulolytic de-\ngraders (Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Fibrobac-\nteraceae, Spirochaetes) and a high diversity of secondary\nfermenters (Prevotellaceae and Bacteroidales), which all\nincrease in abundance during the wet season. The first\ndegraders attach to the plant cell walls and hydrolyze\ncellulose, hemicellulose, and xylan into smaller polysac-\ncharides and oligosaccharides [12, 51], while secondary\nfermenters ferment those soluble polysaccharides into\nmore simple sugars [10, 54]. Ruminococcaceae and Lach-\nnospiraceae are the two main cellulolytic taxa in the\nmammalian gut and commonly increase in prevalence\nwhen animals eat more leaves and plants [7, 29]. In\nterms of secondary fermenters, Prevotella are widely\nknown for their role in breaking down non-cellulosic\npolysaccharides and pectin [10, 12]. They are the major\nconstituent (~ 70%) of rumen bacteria [55], and com-\nmonly increase in high fiber or fruit diets [29, 53, 56,\n57]. Members of Bacteroidales\u2014and particularly from\nthe Bacteroides genus\u2014have some of the largest reper-\ntoires of carbohydrate degrading activities and are able\nto ferment a broad range of plant polysaccharides [10,\n58\u201360]. The increase in these cellulolytic/fibrolytic taxa\nand the high versatility of the secondary fermenters\nlikely allow geladas to optimally extract nutrients from\ngrasses eaten during wet periods.\nIn contrast, during drier periods, when geladas relied\nmore on underground storage organs, we found a corre-\nsponding increase in microbial families involved in amy-\nlolytic and saccharolytic activities (Succinivibrionaceae,\nStreptococcaceae, Christensenellaceae). Interestingly, Suc-\ncinivibrionaceae also increased during periods of ener-\ngetic stress in Tibetan macaques (Macaca thibetana)\n[26] and during the dry season in the Hazda hunter\ngatherers of Tanzania [61], suggesting that it might help\nhosts cope with diet-related energy shortfalls. The gelada\nmicrobiome during the dry season was also character-\nized by an increase in Methanobrevibacter, a genus\ncontaining\nhydrogenotrophic\narchaea\nthat\nconverts\nhydrogen and formate into methane [62]. The simultan-\neous enrichment of efficient hydrogen-producers (e.g.,\nChristensenellaceae\n[63],\nHydrogenoanaerobacterium:\n[64]) and formate-producers (Succinivibrionaceae: [65]),\ncombined with methanogens during the dry season sug-\ngest that these taxa work together in syntropy to im-\nprove the efficiency of polysaccharide fermentation from\nstarch in the gut in dry periods [66, 67]. In mice and\nhumans, a higher abundance of methanogenic archaea\nincreases calorie harvest from diet, facilitates SCFA pro-\nduction by other fermentative bacteria, and stimulates\nlipogenesis [66\u201369].\nFinally, drier periods were also characterized by a large\nincrease in the RFP12 family (i.e., ~ 30% versus ~ 18% in\nwetter periods) from the Kiritimatiellaeota phylum. The\nRFP12 family remains poorly characterized but is in-\ncreasingly recognized as being a keystone bacterial group\nin the hindgut of horses (Equus ferus caballus) [70\u201372],\nand a common inhabitant of the rumen of sheep (Ovis\naries) or cattle [73\u201375]. The bacterial sequences belong-\ning to the RFP12 family found in the gelada feces were,\non average, 97% similar to bacterial sequences found in\nthe feces of various hindgut herbivorous fermenters [48]\nBaniel et al. Microbiome            (2021) 9:26 \nPage 9 of 20\nand, to a lesser extent, in the rumen of foregut fermen-\nters (Table S3). This suggests that the RFP12 family\nplays a particularly important, but thus far uncharacter-\nized, digestive role for herbivorous species. In the case of\ngeladas, it further suggests that it might be a keystone\nbacterial group for the digestion of some underground\nfood components commonly eaten by the geladas during\ndry periods.\nOverall, the gut microbes present in geladas are poorly\nrepresented by reference bacterial genomes in the two\nmost common microbial databases: SILVA (updated\n2017) [76] and Greengenes 13_8 (updated 2013) [77].\nTaxonomic assignment of bacteria beyond the family\nlevel is relatively low (only 65% of our reads were\nassigned to genus level) compared to assignment of se-\nquences found in captive animals and humans. This\npoor taxonomic characterization limits our ability to\nunderstand the metabolic activities of gut microbiome\ncommunities, and highlights the need to generate more\nmolecular microbial data from a wider range of non-\nmodel\nand\nwild\norganisms.\nThe\nKiritimatiellaeota\nphylum (and in particular the RFP12 family) would be a\ngood candidate to focus on.\nAt the functional level, bacterial genes involved in en-\nergy, amino acid, and lipid metabolism increased in\nprevalence during the dry season. In particular, meta-\nbolic pathways linked to cellular respiration, methano-\ngenesis, and carbon fixation pathways of prokaryotes\nbecame more common, strongly suggesting that both\nbacterial energy production and cellular activity were\nstimulated during this time. One interpretation of this\ndata is that the increase in cellular activity simply re-\nflects a dietary switch to starch, which is easier to\nhydrolyze than cellulose, and thus might more readily\nprovoke a stimulation of bacterial activity and carbohy-\ndrate fermentation. Alternatively, the stimulation of bac-\nterial energy metabolism and cellular activity could\nreflect a higher production of SCFAs by gut bacteria,\nsupplying the host with additional energy in periods of\nnutrient restriction (when relying on fallback foods) [31,\n78]. Similar increases in predicted bacterial energy me-\ntabolism have been found in energetically challenging\nenvironments (e.g., high altitude) in several other mam-\nmalian species and were correlated with higher SCFA\nproduction [31, 32]. Analysis of fecal SCFA profiles in\ngeladas would help to identify if this is also the case in\nthis high-altitude species. One caveat to our analysis is\nthat the accuracy of the PICRUSt2 functional predictions\nmay be lower than in other studies, especially when\ncompared to published NSTI values in other mammals\n[50]. Previous studies of mammalian gut microbiomes\nconducted PICRUSt analyses on bacterial sequences\ngrouped by OTUs, instead of ASVs. Because OTUs\ngroup sequences with 97% of similarity together, it\nremoves 3% of genetic variation; and thus by definition\nOTUs will be closer to samples from reference genomes,\npotentially leading to lower NSTI values. Thus, although\nour analyses are reflecting only a limited portion of the\nbacterial community of geladas, it is not necessarily a\nworse representation than found in previous studies\nclustering bacteria by OTUs. Overall, while our pre-\ndicted functions might give us a broad profile of the\ndifferences in metabolic activities of gut bacteria in\nthe dry and wet seasons, they are not as precise as\nfunctional\ncharacterization\nfrom\nmetagenomic\nor\nmetabolomic data.\nWhile it is clear that the gelada diet shifts during drier\nperiods, it remains unknown if (and to what extent)\ngeladas are nutritionally or energetically constrained\nduring this time. Grass availability declines and geladas\nspend more time foraging and digging for underground\nplant parts during the dry season [35, 42]. Such under-\nground foods are usually considered fallback foods be-\ncause individuals rely on them only when grass is less\navailable and because they require long processing times\n[35, 38]. However, one study [42] found that geladas\nobtain just as much, or even more, calories from under-\nground storage organs as they do from grass. Whether\nthis increased caloric intake is offset by increased for-\naging costs is currently unknown. However, even if in-\ncreased foraging costs were demonstrated, our data\nsuggests that the gut microbiota may increase digestive\nefficiency from starchy food and thereby help geladas\nmaintain or improve energetic status during the dry\nseason. Future studies on seasonal changes in energy\nbalance will help resolve this issue.\nIn contrast to the effect of rainfall, we found mixed\nevidence for the effect of temperature on the gut micro-\nbiome. Temperature only explained ~ 0.33% of variation\nin the gelada gut microbiome composition. Furthermore,\nfew taxa shifted in abundance between the coldest and\nhottest months, and most taxa affected by temperature\nwere also affected by rainfall. This might be explained by\nthe fact that rainfall (and thus diet) covaries with\ntemperature to some extent (Pearson\u2019s correlation coeffi-\ncient = 0.20): geladas rely the most on underground\nfoods in the hot-dry season (Feb. to May) and the most\non grass on the cold-wet season (Jun. to Sep.) [35]. The\ncold-dry season (Oct. to Jan.), however, displays a mixed\npattern of diet and temperature: grass availability is still\nhigh in Oct.-Nov. (following the rainy season) but de-\ncreases markedly in Dec.-Jan. [35, 41]. These 2 months\nare thus characterized by the introduction of under-\nground foods in the diet and are also the coldest months\nof the year, making them likely the most challenging\ntimes for geladas (compounding nutritional and thermo-\nregulatory challenges). Accordingly, cold periods were\ncharacterized by an increase in two amylolytic and\nBaniel et al. Microbiome            (2021) 9:26 \nPage 10 of 20\nlactate-producing\ntaxa\n(Streptococcus,\nLactobacillus),\npresumably to more efficiently extract starch from the\nunderground foods. At the functional level, the energy\nand lipid metabolism of bacteria were also stimulated in\nthe cold months, further suggesting some role of gut\nbacteria in stimulating host digestive efficiency and en-\nergy metabolism during thermoregulatory-demanding\ntimes.\nThese seasonal changes that increase energy pro-\nduction during colder periods may come at some\ncost. Such trade-offs have been proposed where shifts\nthat benefit one aspect of host physiology conse-\nquently lead to a decrease in other microbes that may\nalso be necessary for the host. For example, microbes\nthat promote host digestive efficiency and energy me-\ntabolism may also promote inflammation or even sup-\npress immune function [33, 79]. We did not detect\nany obvious evidence of these tradeoffs in geladas,\nbut future work that incorporates detailed host im-\nmunological and functional microbial data is needed\nto help determine if such trade-offs exist.\nFinally, the present study found that the gelada gut\nmicrobiome was largely explained by individual identity\n(20%), a pattern consistent with data from a range of\nvertebrates [40, 80\u201382], including humans [83, 84].\nHowever, the effect of social group was lower in geladas\nthan reported for other social mammals (geladas: 6.0%\nvs., e.g., yellow baboon, Papio cynocephalus: 18.6% of\nvariation explained [85], black howler monkey: 14% [86],\nring-tailed lemurs, Lemur catta: 21% [87], Welsh Moun-\ntain ponies: 14%: [82]). The combination of large indi-\nvidual effects with weak social group effects closely\nresembles data reported for the Guassa gelada popula-\ntion [40], suggesting a general, but consistent pattern.\nThe weak unit-level effects may result from the unique\nsocial system of geladas: Because social units often ag-\ngregate into large bands whose composition changes\nregularly, geladas may have a higher rate of inter-unit\nmicrobial transmission compared with other primates.\nFuture studies should explore in more detail the intra-\nindividual fluctuation in gut microbiome composition,\nand whether group differences in ranging patterns may\nexplain these differences.\nOther individual predictors, namely, age, sex, and female\nreproductive state, had a very limited effect on the gut\nmicrobiome, mirroring results in other mammals (yellow\nbaboons: [28, 85], ring-tailed lemurs: [87], Verreaux\u2019s si-\nfakas, Propithecus verreauxi: [29], chimpanzees, Pan trog-\nlodytes schweinfurthii: [88], rhesus monkeys, Macaca\nmulatta: [89], Welsh Mountain ponies [82], domestic dog,\nCanis lupus familiaris: [90], but see black howler mon-\nkeys: [34] or Egyptian fruit bats, Rousettus aegyptiacus:\n[80]). Although female geladas harbored higher microbial\nrichness than males, this resulted in minimal differences\nin gut microbial composition and predicted function.\nCompared to males, females had higher abundance of Pro-\nteobacteria and Lactobacillus. These two bacterial taxa\nwere previously reported to increase during pregnancy\nand lactation in humans and non-human primates [27,\n91], and act as early colonizers of the infant gut [92\u201394].\nAdditionally, pregnant female geladas harbored more\nHelicobacter, a potentially pathogenic genus [95, 96]. An\nincrease in potentially pathogenic microbes in pregnant\nfemales was also observed in black howler monkeys [34]\nand was hypothesized to be the consequence of a trade-off\nbetween reproduction and immunity. These dynamics\nwarrant further investigation.\nOverall, the gut microbiome of geladas seems to be\nhighly plastic and can respond rapidly to changes in host\ndiet and thermoregulatory demands. Stimulation of bac-\nteria cellular activity could allow geladas to maintain ad-\nequate or even improved energetic balance during dry\nand cold periods. Our study adds to an increasing body\nof literature suggesting that the gut microbiota is an im-\nportant system providing dietary and metabolic flexibil-\nity for the host and might be a key factor influencing the\nacclimatization to changing environments [8, 48, 97, 98].\nIn addition to fostering phenotypic plasticity, the gut\nmicrobiome is increasingly hypothesized to contribute to\nhost evolution and speciation [97\u201399] given the strong\nhost phylogenetic signal in mammalian microbiome\ncomposition and function [100, 101] and evidence of\nmicrobiome heritability [102\u2013104]. To the extent that\nmicrobiomes affect host phenotypes under selection,\nthey will also affect host evolutionary trajectories. In the\ncase of geladas, a shift in gut microbiome composition\nwas probably an important adaptive mechanism that\nallowed members of the Theropithecus genus to adopt a\nspecialized dietary niche and diversify rapidly from Papio\n~ 5 million years ago [105]. Contrary to host adaptive\ngenetic mutations, which occur over the course of many\ngenerations, the gut microbiota can shift in response to\nchanges in host diet in a matter of days [9]. Given that\nthe common ancestor of Theropithecus and Papio was\nomnivorous [106, 107], dietary flexibility provided by the\ngut microbiome may have been an important first step\nallowing members of Theropithecus to exploit new grass-\nland habitats in East Africa, leading to the evolution of a\nspecialized diet and, ultimately, further genetic and\nphenotypic adaptation.\nConclusion\nThe gut microbiome of geladas is plastic and responds\nrapidly to changes in host diet and thermoregulatory de-\nmands. These shifts appear to help geladas cope with\nseasonal fluctuations in nutrient intake and energy\nhomeostasis, potentially allowing them to maintain en-\nergy balance in challenging seasonal environments. Our\nBaniel et al. Microbiome            (2021) 9:26 \nPage 11 of 20\nstudy adds to an increasing body of literature suggesting\nthat the gut microbiota is an important system that pro-\nvides metabolic flexibility for the host, and is key to\nhelping hosts adapt and shift to fluctuating environ-\nments. Future research in geladas and other animals will\nfurther uncover how the gut microbiota allows hosts to\noccupy unique dietary niches, potentially allowing host\nlineages to expand into new habitats, and facilitating\nspeciation.\nMaterial and methods\nStudy population and fecal sample collection\nWe collected fecal samples from a wild population of\ngeladas living in the Simien Mountains National Park, in\nnorthern Ethiopia (13\u00b0 15\u2032 N, 38\u00b0 00\u2032 E). Samples were\ncollected over a 4-year period between Jan. 2015 and\nFeb. 2019. Geladas live in multi-level societies, where re-\nproductive units (comprising a leader male, several adult\nfemales, their offspring, and occasionally 1\u20132 follower\nmales) and bachelor groups (comprising between 1 and\n10 adult males) form the smallest levels of the society\nthat forage and sleep together in a \u201cband\u201d sharing the\nsame home range [108]. Since Jan. 2006, the Simien\nMountains Gelada Research Project (SMGRP) has col-\nlected demographic and behavioral data on over 200 in-\ndividuals from two bands. All individuals are habituated\nto\nhuman\nobservers\non\nfoot\nand\nare\nindividually\nrecognizable. Dates of birth of individuals were estab-\nlished using a combination of known (N = 42) and esti-\nmated (N = 89) birth dates. Estimated birth dates were\ncalculated by using the mean individual age at major\nlife-history milestones in our population (e.g., sexual\nmaturation or first birth for females and canine eruption\nfor males) [109, 110]. Birth dates of unknown immigrant\nmales were estimated using an established protocol\nbased on body size and other age-related morphological\ncharacteristics [110]. Here, we focused only on samples\nfrom\nadult\nmales\nand\nfemales.\nAdult\nmales\nwere\nincluded when they reached 7 years of age. At this age,\nmales have reached adult body size in stature but not in\nweight [110, 111], and most males have dispersed into a\nnon-natal group (i.e., 96% of our male samples, males\ncould thus be leaders, followers, bachelors, or natals).\nAdult females were included after they had experienced\ntheir first sex skin swelling, a marker of reproductive\nmaturation (which is around 4.65 years old in our\npopulation [109]).\nFecal samples of known adult and subadult male and\nfemale subjects were collected regularly and opportunis-\ntically\nduring\nthe\nstudy\nperiod.\nImmediately\nupon\ndefecation, approximately 1.5 g of feces was collected in 3\nml of RNA later [112, 113], stored at room temperature\nfor up to 2 months, and subsequently shipped to the Uni-\nversity of Washington (UW). At UW, samples were stored\nat \u221280 \u00b0C until the sequencing libraries were prepared. A\ntotal of 758 samples (620 female samples, 138 male sam-\nples) were collected from 131 individuals (83 females, 48\nmales) (mean \u00b1 SD = 5.79 \u00b1 6.14 samples per individual,\nrange = 1-21) from 28 reproductive units and 4 bachelors\ngroups (mean \u00b1 SD = 4.69 \u00b1 2.97 number of individuals\nsampled per unit, range = 1-11).\nThe reproductive state of females at the date of sample\ncollection was assigned based on daily monitoring of in-\ndividuals for the status of sex skin swellings and the\nbirth of infants. We assigned the three reproductive\nstates as follows: (1) Cycling began at the first sign of\npostpartum sex skin swelling and ended when a female\nconceived\u2014with conception defined as 183 days (mean\ngestation length) before the birth of a subsequent infant\n[109]. (2) Pregnancy started on the date of conception\nand ended the day before parturition. (3) Finally, lacta-\ntion started on the day of parturition and ended the day\nbefore the female\u2019s first postpartum swelling. Lactating\nfemales were further categorized as being in early lacta-\ntion (infant < 1 year old) or late lactation (infant > 1 year\nold). When testing the effect of reproductive state, late\nlactating females were removed from the lactating cat-\negory to include only females that were still nursing at\nthe time of sample collection (females resume cycling\nwhen infants are ~ 1.5 years old in our population, which\nis presumably accompanied by infant weaning around\nthe same time [109]). Furthermore, because pregnant fe-\nmales can abort their fetus during male takeover of their\nreproductive unit [114], some pregnancies might have\nbeen misidentified as cycling based on our method of\nback-calculating from the date of birth. We therefore re-\nmoved cycling females that experienced a takeover in\nthe previous 6 months before the date of sample collec-\ntion (N = 55 samples) to avoid any misclassification of\nreproductive state in our analyses.\nStudy site and climatic data\nThe study area is located at 3200 m above sea level and\nis characterized as an Afroalpine grassland ecosystem,\nconsisting of grassland plateaus, scrublands, and Erica-\nceous forests [115]. Fecal samples were collected across\nthe year, with roughly equal coverage across seasons\n(244 in cold-dry, 298 in cold-wet, and 216 in hot-dry\nseason as defined above). As part of the long-term moni-\ntoring of the SMGRP, daily cumulative rainfall and mini-\nmum and maximum temperature are recorded on a\nnear-daily basis. We used the total cumulative rainfall\nover the 30 days prior to the date of fecal sample collec-\ntion as a proxy for grass availability at the time of sample\ncollection [35]. In addition, we used the average mini-\nmum daily temperatures in the 30 days preceding the\ndate of sample collection as a proxy of thermoregulatory\nconstraints. The average minimum temperature is less\nBaniel et al.

We extracted microbial DNA from the\nfecal samples using Qiagen\u2019s PowerLyzer PowerSoil\nDNA Isolation kit (Qiagen #12855) following the stand-\nard protocol. We amplified the hypervariable V4 region\nof the 16S rRNA gene using PCR primer set 515F\n(TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG\nGTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 806R (GTCTCG\nTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGGAC\nTACNVGGGTWTCTAA\nT) from The Human Microbiome Project and a dual-\nindexing approach [116]. Details of the amplification\nprotocol can be accessed at https://smack-lab.com/\nprotocols/. The first PCR round aimed at amplifying the\nV4 region. Each 25 \u03bcl PCR reaction well consisted of\n12.5 \u03bcl of Nebnext Ultra II Q5 mastermix, 1.0 \u03bcl of each\nprimer, and 25 ng of total DNA in 10.5 \u03bcl of nuclease-\nfree water. PCR was performed in an Eppendorf thermo-\ncycler with a 100 \u00b0C heated lid using the following cyc-\nling steps: an initial denaturing for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C;\nfollowed by 15 cycles of 20 s at 98 \u00b0C, 15 s at 62 \u00b0C, 60 s\nat 72 \u00b0C, and a final hold at 4 \u00b0C. We cleaned up the\nPCR reaction with a 2:1 ratio of SPRI beads to PCR\namplified DNA. The second PCR round aimed at adding\na unique index primer combination to molecularly bar-\ncode each sample. We took 4 \u03bcl of product from the first\nPCR and added 6 \u03bcl of Nebnext Ultra II Q5 mastermix\nand 1 \u03bcl of n5 and n7 indexing primers, with each sam-\nple being assigned a unique n5/n7 index primer combin-\nation. This 12 \u03bcl reaction was placed in an Eppendorf\nthermocycler with a 100 \u00b0C heated lid, denatured for 5\nmin at 95 \u00b0C, and amplified with 10 cycles of 20 s at\n98 \u00b0C, 15 s at 55 \u00b0C, and 60 s at 72 \u00b0C with a final hold at\n4 \u00b0C. After a 2:1 SPRI bead clean-up, amplification of the\nV4 region was confirmed in a few samples using an\nAATI fragment analyzer, and all libraries were quantified\nusing a qubit fluorometer. The libraries were then\npooled in roughly equimolar amounts (each with their\nown unique indexing primer combination), spiked with\n10% PhiX to increase library complexity, and sequenced\ntogether on a single Illumina NovaSeq 6000 SP 250 bp\npaired-end sequence flowcell.\nWe analyzed the resulting data using the Quantitative\nInsights Into Microbial Ecology 2 (QIIME2) platform\n[117, 118]. After trimming low-quality bases from the\nde-multiplexed reads, we merged overlapping paired-end\nreads, and denoised the sequencing data by filtering and\ncorrecting Illumina amplicon sequencing errors using\nthe Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm 2 (DADA2:\n[119]) plugin incorporated in QIIME2. DADA2 infers se-\nquences exactly resulting in amplicon sequence variants\n(ASVs). Forward and reverse reads were trimmed to 220\nand 180 bases, respectively, to remove the low-quality\nportion of the sequences. The forward and reverse reads\nwere then merged together and chimeric sequences were\nremoved. Only samples with more than 20,000 reads\nwere retained for analyses (following observation of rar-\nefaction curves, Figure S12). After filtering, trimming,\nmerging, and chimera removal, we retained a total of\n348,390,395 reads across the 758 fecal samples (459,618\n\u00b1 815,020 reads per sample, range = 20,109-10,735,588).\nASVs were taxonomically assigned using the q2-feature\nclassifier in QIIME2 against version 132 of the SILVA\ndatabase (updated December 2017) [76] based on 100%\nsimilarity.\nUninformative\ntaxonomic\nassignments\nof\nASVs found in SILVA (e.g., \u201cwallaby metagenome,\u201d \u201cun-\nassigned bacteria,\u201d etc.) were converted to \u201cNA\u201d to sim-\nplify analyses at higher taxonomic levels. All ASVs\nbelonging to the order WCHB1-41 (phylum Kiritimatiel-\nlaeota) were not assigned at the family level in the\nSILVA classification. However, in the Greengene classifi-\ncation (version 13_8) [77], all ASVs from this order in\nthe gelada gut were assigned to the RFP12 family. Thus,\nwe attribute the family RFP12 to all ASVs from the\norder WCHB1-41 in SILVA classification. The 78 ASVs\nfrom the RFP12 family were found in particular high\nproportion in the gelada feces, but we did not have taxo-\nnomic\ninformation\nabout\nthose bacterial\nsequences\nbelow the family level. We thus mined previously pub-\nlished data to identify bacterial sequences most similar\nto the 78 RPF12 ASVs in geladas by using the NCBI\nBLAST search engine [46, 47]. For each of those 78\nASV, we searched for the most similar nucleotide se-\nquences previously published, extracted its top five hits\n(i.e., most similar sequences based on the E value), and\nsummarized the distribution of those top hits per ASV\nacross the 78 ASVs (including in which animal species\nthose hits were found, see Table S3). The five top hits\nhad an average of 97% nucleotide similarity (range, 93-\n100%) with their respective similar gelada ASVs.\nStatistical analyses\nThe count and taxonomy files generated by QIIME2 were\nimported into R version 3.5.2 [120] using the qiime2R\npackage [121] and analyzed using the phyloseq package\n[122]. The majority of the 19,606 ASVs in our dataset\nwere found at very low frequency or only in one sample\n(71% of ASVs were found in only one sample and 6.2% of\nASVs were not assigned at the phylum level). Thus, we\nBaniel et al. Microbiome            (2021) 9:26 \nPage 13 of 20\nfurther filtered the count table to retain only ASVs that\nhad at least 500 reads in total in the dataset (i.e., 0.00014%\nrelative abundance) to eliminate potentially artifactual se-\nquences. With this filtering criteria, only 3295 ASVs\nremained, with all of them assigned at the phylum level\nand most (97%) observed in at least two samples (Figure\nS13). The use of rarefaction (i.e., subsampling of the read\ncount in each sample to a common sequencing depth) has\nbeen discouraged due to the loss of information and preci-\nsion [123], as well as the use of count normalization\nmethods from the RNA-seq field (e.g., DESeq2 or edgeR).\nHowever, microbiome datasets are more sparse (zero-in-\nflated) and more asymmetrical than genetic expression\ndatasets [124, 125]. Thus, we used a compositional\napproach\nwhen\npossible\n(e.g.,\ncentered-log-ratio\nnormalization of the counts and Aitchison distance for\nbeta diversity analysis) [125, 126], controlling for sample\nsequencing depth in multivariate analyses to account for\nrepeated samples from the same individual.\nWe replicated alpha- and beta-diversity analyses using\ntraditional rarefaction methods to facilitate comparisons\nwith other studies. To generate the rarefied dataset, we\nrandomly sampled 20,000 reads from the raw fastq files\nof each sample and processed this new rarefied dataset\ninto the DADA2 pipeline. This dataset was further fil-\ntered to remove the low-frequency ASVs (i.e., ASVs not\nincluded in the pool of 3295 ASVs retained in the full\ndataset). This resulted in a dataset containing the same\n758\nsamples,\nwith\n2853\nASVs\nand\nwith\nrelatively\nhomogenous sequencing depth (18205 \u00b1 1415 reads per\nsample, range = 7460-19444). We rarefied reads from\nthe raw fastq files prior to DADA2 processing instead of\nthe traditional approach of rarefying after DADA2 using\nthe rarefy_even_depth function of the phyloseq package\n[122] because the traditional approach did not eliminate\nthe effect of sequencing depth (post-DADA2) on the\nalpha diversity metrics in the rarefied dataset. Sub-\nsampling the raw fastq files allowed us to better gen-\nerate indices of alpha diversity per sample that did\nnot depend on the total number of reads obtained\ninitially for the sample.\nAll mixed models described below were run using\neither the lmer (for linear mixed models, LMMs) or\nglmer (for binomial and negative binomial generalized\nlinear mixed models, GLMMs) functions of the lme4\npackage [127]. All quantitative variables (i.e., cumulative\nrainfall,\naveraged\ntemperature,\nand\nage)\nwere\nz-\ntransformed to have a mean of zero and a standard devi-\nation of one to facilitate model convergence. The signifi-\ncance of the fixed factors was tested using a likelihood\nratio test, LRT (assuming an asymptotic chi-square dis-\ntribution of the test statistic) via the drop1 function. To\ntest for significant pairwise differences between levels of\nmultilevel categorical variables (i.e., reproductive state),\npost hoc Tukey\u2019s Honest Significant Difference tests\nwere carried out using the multcomp package in R\n[128].\nAlpha-diversity analyses\nWe calculated three measures of alpha diversity: observed\nrichness (the total number of different ASVs in a sample),\nShannon diversity index (accounts for both richness and\nevenness of ASVs in a sample), and Faith\u2019s phylogenetic\ndiversity (accounts for phylogenetic distance between bac-\nterial species, using the picante package [129]). We mod-\neled each alpha diversity metric using linear mixed\nmodels: (i) as a function of age, sex, cumulative monthly\nrainfall, average monthly minimum temperature, and se-\nquencing depth of the sample (N = 758 samples), and (ii)\nas a function of reproductive state (cycling, early lactating,\nand pregnant), age, cumulative monthly rainfall, and aver-\nage monthly minimum temperature in samples collected\nfrom females (N = 439). Individual identity and unit mem-\nbership were included as random effects to control for in-\ndividual and unit repetition across samples. We also ran\nthe same models on the rarefied dataset (Table S16).\nBeta-diversity analyses\nWe then assessed how the same predictors were associ-\nated with between-sample community dissimilarity. To\naccount for differences in sequencing depth between\nsamples, the counts were normalized using the centered-\nlog-ratio (CLR) method (and using a pseudo count of\n0.65 for zero counts) from the \u201ccompositions\u201d package\n[130]. We then calculated the Aitchison distance be-\ntween\nsamples\n(i.e.,\nsimply\nthe\nEuclidean\ndistance\nbetween samples after clr transformation of the counts)\n[131] and conducted a Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA)\n(function\n\u201cprcomp\u201d)\nto\nvisually\nrepresent\nbetween-samples dissimilarity according to the predic-\ntors. This approach has been recommended for micro-\nbiome datasets [125] and allows for the projection of\neach sample onto individual principal components (PCS)\nand the variable loadings of ASVs onto each PC. While\nthe first axis of variation correlated mostly with rainfall\n(Fig. 2b), the second PCA axis was correlated with se-\nquencing depth and explained 11% of the variation (Fig-\nure S14). We used Permutational Multivariate Analysis\nof Variance (PERMANOVA) tests to assess the effect of\nthe predictors on the Aitchison distance between sam-\nples (using 10,000 permutations and the \u201cadonis2\u201d func-\ntion from the \u201cvegan\u201d package [132]). We ran three\ndifferent models: (1) including all samples where we\ntested only the effect of individual identity and sequen-\ncing depth, (2) including all samples where we tested the\neffect of unit, age, sex, cumulative monthly rainfall, aver-\nage monthly minimum temperature, and sequencing\ndepth of the sample, and (3) including only female\nBaniel et al. Microbiome            (2021) 9:26 \nPage 14 of 20\nsamples where we tested the effect of unit, reproductive\nstate, age, cumulative monthly rainfall, and average\nmonthly minimum temperature. In models 2 and 3, indi-\nvidual\nidentity\nwas\nincluded\nas\na\nblocking\nfactor\n(\u201cstrata\u201d) to control for repeated sampling. We also rep-\nlicated beta diversity analysis on the rarefied dataset. We\nran PERMANOVA tests using three complementary\npairwise dissimilarity metrics (Bray-Curtis distance, un-\nweighted and weighted UniFrac distances) to assess\nbetween-sample variation according to the same predic-\ntors (the same three models). Beta diversity results\nremained qualitatively similar (Table S17).\nDifferential abundance testing\nWe examined how our predictors were associated with\ndifferential abundance of bacteria (at the phylum, class,\norder, family, and genus levels) using negative binomial\nGLMMs. Compared to LMMs, negative binomial mixed\nmodels are better equipped to handle over-dispersed\nand zero-inflated distributions that often characterize\nmicrobiome datasets [133]. They also facilitate tests of\nseveral independent predictors while taking into account\nlongitudinal designs including random effects. We first\naggregated the counts (i.e., the number of reads per taxa\nand per sample) at the taxonomic level of interest. Only\ntaxa that had an average relative abundance across sam-\nples \u22650.01% were tested. Then, for a given taxa, the\ncount per sample was modeled as a function of (1) age,\nsex, cumulative monthly rainfall and averaged monthly\nminimum temperature (all samples), or (2) female repro-\nductive state, age, cumulative monthly rainfall, and aver-\naged monthly minimum temperature (female samples\nonly). The log-transformed number of reads per sample\nwas included as an offset term to control for variation in\nsequencing depth across samples. Individual identity and\nunit membership were included as random effects in all\nmodels. When negative binomial models failed to con-\nverge in some taxa, we converted the counts in pres-\nence/absence and modeled them with binomial GLMMs.\nBenjamini-Hochberg\ncorrected\np-values\n< 0.05\nwere\nconsidered statistically significant.\nFunctional profiling of microbiota\nWe estimated the bacterial and archaeal genes present\nin the metagenomes of each sample using Phylogenetic\nInvestigation of Communities by Reconstruction of\nUnobserved States version 2 (PICRUSt2) [50]. In brief,\nASVs were aligned to reference sequences using HMME\nR [134] and placed into a reference tree using EPA-NG\n[135] and Gappa [136]. PICRUSt2 normalizes for mul-\ntiple 16S gene copies in bacteria using castor, a hidden\nstate prediction tool [137]. The normalized data were\nused to predict gene family profiles, and mapped onto\ngene pathways using MinPath [138]. We followed the\ndefault protocols outlined on the PICRUSt2 GitHub\npage (https://github.com/picrust/picrust2/wiki). We in-\nvestigated the predicted gene families using the Kyoto\nEncyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthology\n(KO) database. The accuracy of the PICRUSt2 predic-\ntions for each sample was assessed by calculating the\nweighted Nearest Sequence Taxon Index (NSTI) score, a\nmeasure of how similar the bacteria from the sample are\nto reference genome sequences. Five ASVs (out of 3295)\nhad a NSTI score > 2 and were removed from our final\npredictions. The association between the relative abun-\ndance of functional categories as estimated by PICRUSt2\nand the predictors (on all samples or female samples\nonly) were examined using LMMs. Only functional path-\nways that had \u22650.1% relative abundance across samples\nwere tested. Individual identity and unit membership\nwere included as random effects in all models.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.\norg/10.1186/s40168-020-00977-9.\nAdditional file 1: Table S1.

We hypothesized that macrophages migrating to adipose tissue upon high-fat feeding may differ from \nthose that reside there under normal diet conditions. To this end, we found a novel F4/80+CD11c+ population \nof ATMs in adipose tissue of obese mice that was not seen in lean mice. ATMs from lean mice expressed many \ngenes characteristic of M2 or \u201calternatively activated\u201d macrophages, including Ym1, arginase 1, and Il10. Diet-\ninduced obesity decreased expression of these genes in ATMs while increasing expression of genes such as \nthose encoding TNF-\u03b1 and iNOS that are characteristic of M1 or \u201cclassically activated\u201d macrophages. Interest-\ningly, ATMs from obese C-C motif chemokine receptor 2\u2013KO (Ccr2-KO) mice express M2 markers at levels similar \nto those from lean mice. The antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10, which was overexpressed in ATMs from lean \nmice, protected adipocytes from TNF-\u03b1\u2013induced insulin resistance. Thus, diet-induced obesity leads to a shift \nin the activation state of ATMs from an M2-polarized state in lean animals that may protect adipocytes from \ninflammation to an M1 proinflammatory state that contributes to insulin resistance.\nIntroduction\nRecent investigations suggest that obesity gives rise to a state \nof chronic, low-grade inflammation that contributes to insulin \nresistance and type 2 diabetes (1, 2). Although the tissues and cell \ntypes involved in this inflammatory response are not fully under-\nstood, there is significant interest in the role of adipose tissue \nmacrophages (ATMs) in the inflammatory changes characteristic \nof obesity (3). In both humans and rodents, ATMs accumulate \nin adipose tissue with increasing body weight and their quantity \ncorrelates with measures of insulin resistance (4\u20136). In obese sub-\njects, ATM content is higher in visceral than subcutaneous adi-\npose tissue, consistent with the hypothesis that visceral fat plays \na more prominent role in insulin resistance (7). Moreover, weight \nloss leads to a reduction in both inflammatory markers and ATM \ncontent (4, 7). ATMs are a prominent source of proinflammatory \ncytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 that can block insulin action in \nadipocytes, providing a potential link between inflammation and \ninsulin resistance (6, 8).\nMouse models have demonstrated that ATMs are both neces-\nsary and sufficient for the development of insulin resistance with \nobesity. Mice with targeted deletions in the genes for monocyte \nchemoattractant protein\u20131 (Mcp1/Ccl2) and its receptor C-C motif \nchemokine receptor 2 (Ccr2) both have decreased ATM content, \ndecreased inflammation in fat, and protection from high-fat \ndiet\u2013induced (HFD-induced) insulin resistance (9, 10). Converse-\nly, mice overexpressing MCP-1 have increased numbers of ATMs \nalong with increased insulin resistance (9, 11). Moreover, myeloid-\nspecific KO of I\u03baB kinase \u03b2 (Ikbkb) produced mice with improved \ninsulin sensitivity on HFD (12). Together, these data suggest that \nboth the recruitment and proinflammatory activation of ATMs \nare required for the development of diabetes with obesity.\nWhile quantitative changes in ATM content with obesity and \ndiabetes are well supported, little is known about the range of \nATM function and how this may change with obesity. ATMs are \npresent in moderate quantities in adipose tissue of lean mice \nin which inflammatory signals are low or nonexistent (5, 6), \nand their role there is unclear. While Ccr2-KO (CCR2KO) and \nMcp1-KO mice have lower inflammatory cytokine expression \nin fat, they retain significant macrophage content within adi-\npose tissue (9, 10). This suggests that factors both dependent \nand independent of the MCP-1/CCR2 axis are involved in mac-\nrophage recruitment to fat and, further, that not all ATMs are \nprogrammed for proinflammatory signaling.\nMacrophages show significant heterogeneity in function, as local \nenvironmental factors shape their properties and activation state \n(13, 14). Different stimuli activate macrophages to express distinct \npatterns of chemokines, surface markers, and metabolic enzymes \nthat ultimately generate the diversity of macrophage function seen \nin inflammatory and noninflammatory settings. Macrophage acti-\nvation has been operationally defined across 2 separate polarization \nstates, M1 and M2 (13, 14). These states have largely been defined \nin vitro, and tissue macrophages are likely activated along a con-\ntinuum between these states in vivo. M1 or \u201cclassically activated\u201d \nmacrophages are induced by proinflammatory mediators such as \nLPS and IFN-\u03b3. M1 macrophages have enhanced proinflammatory \ncytokine production (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-12) and generate reactive oxy-\ngen species such as NO via activation of iNOS (Nos2).\nM2 or \u201calternatively activated\u201d macrophages are generated in \nvitro by exposure to IL-4 and IL-13 (15). M2 macrophages have \nlow proinflammatory cytokine expression and instead generate \nhigh levels of antiinflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-1 decoy \nreceptor. Additionally, arginase production is increased in M2-\npolarized macrophages. This enzyme blocks iNOS activity by a \nvariety of mechanisms, including competing for the arginine sub-\nstrate that is required for NO production (16). Overall, M2 mac-\nNonstandard abbreviations used: ATM, adipose tissue macrophage; CCR2, C-C \nmotif chemokine receptor 2; CCR2KO mouse, Ccr2-KO mouse; HFD, high-fat diet; \nIRS, insulin receptor substrate; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein\u20131; ND, \nnormal diet; SVF, stromal vascular fraction.\nConflict of interest: The authors have declared that no conflict of interest exists.\nCitation for this article: J.

M2 \npolarization can occur in the absence of IL-4 or IL-13, suggesting \nthat this state may be induced by several different factors (17). \nMoreover, recent studies have shown that IL-4\u2013mediated M2 \npolarization is associated with the activation of transcription fac-\ntors involved in lipid oxidative metabolism that include PPAR\u03b3 \nand PPAR\u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b2 (PGC-1\u03b2) (18).\nIn mice, distinct monocyte subsets contribute to tissue inflam-\nmatory responses (13, 19). Noninflamed tissues are populated \nwith macrophages derived from CX3CR1hiCCR2\u2013 monocytes \n(20). In contrast, acute inflammation increases the levels of \nCX3CR1loCCR2+Ly-6Chi monocytes, which have a higher capac-\nity for migration into inflamed tissues compared with other \nmonocyte populations (21). This model is consistent with obser-\nvations that CCR2KO mice have decreased ATM content (10), \npresumably due to deficient recruitment of CX3CR1loCCR2+ \nmonocytes with retention of the trafficking of CX3CR1hiCCR2\u2013 \nmonocytes into adipose tissue.\nThe qualitative differences between these monocyte/macrophage \nsubtypes in ATMs and obesity are unknown but may be impor-\ntant in understanding the biology of these unique cells and their \ncontribution to diabetes. In this regard, we show here that ATMs \nundergo a phenotypic switch from an antiinflammatory M2 polar-\nization state to a proinflammatory M1 polarization state upon \nhigh-fat feeding, in the process losing their protective capacity.\nResults\nF4/80+CD11b+CD11c+ macrophages accumulate in fat with diet-induced \nobesity. As the majority of previous studies have used F4/80 expres-\nsion as a single marker to identify ATMs, we sought to examine \nATM heterogeneity in lean and obese mice using additional known \nmacrophage markers. Epididymal fat tissue plays a significant role \nin overall metabolism in rodents (22). We thus isolated stromal \nvascular fraction (SVF) cells from epididymal fat pads excised from \nmale mice fed a normal diet (ND) or HFD and analyzed cells by \nflow cytometry. ATMs from both lean and obese mice coexpressed \nF4/80 and CD11b, and the majority of the F4/80+CD11b+ cells \nalso expressed Mac-3 (data not shown). However, there was varia-\ntion in the amount of CD11c expression within the F4/80+CD11b+ \nATMs. The SVF from lean mice contained 17.8% F4/80+ cells, con-\nsistent with other reports (5). Only a small percentage of these cells \ncoexpressed CD11c (9.3% \u00b1 7.5%; n = 3 pools of mice) (Figure 1A). \nIn contrast, obese mice contained increased F4/80+ cell content \nwithin the SVF, with a significant increase in the percentage of \nF4/80+CD11c+ cells (38.4% \u00b1 15% of F4/80+ cells; P = 0.04 versus \nlean mice). These cells also expressed CD11b. Similar results were \nseen in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, with 74% of the F4/80+ cells \ncoexpressing CD11c (data not shown).\nThe total number of both F4/80+CD11c+ cells (4.52 \u00b1 1.1 \u00d7 106 \ncells/mouse versus 0.196 \u00b1 0.16 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse; P = 0.021) \nand F4/80+CD11c\u2013 cells (1.98 \u00b1 0.42 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse versus \n9.69 \u00b1 8.2 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse; P = 0.24) isolated from epididymal \nFigure 1\nAccumulation of F4/80+CD11c+ ATMs in adipose \ntissue in obese mice.

Normalizing this data to fat pad weight indicated \nthat there was a 5.5-fold increase in the content of F4/80+CD11c+ \ncells in adipose tissue from HFD-fed compared with ND mice \n(Figure 1C). In contrast, there was no significant change in the \nquantity of F4/80+CD11c\u2013 cells in adipose tissue per milligram \nfat weight between ND and HFD mice. This demonstrates that \nF4/80+CD11c+ cells are a specific population of ATMs recruited \nto fat tissue upon HFD exposure.\nPrevious studies indicated that targeted deletion of the Ccr2 gene \nresults in decreased macrophage content in adipose tissue and \nimproved insulin sensitivity (10). Thus, CCR2KO mice were also \nexamined for CD11c expression as a complementary mouse model. \nHFD-fed CCR2KO mice demonstrated a reduction in the content \nof F4/80+CD11c+ cells in the SVF compared with wild-type obese \nmice, with 14.4% \u00b1 9.2% of the F4/80+ cells coexpressing CD11c \n(P = 0.08 versus HFD C57BL/6) (Figure 1D). Normalizing for cell \nnumber and fat weight indicated that there was a greater than 50% \nreduction in the level of F4/80+CD11c+ ATMs in the CCR2KO mice \n(HFD C57BL/6, 2.4 \u00b1 0.46 \u00d7 103 cells/mg versus HFD CCR2KO, \n0.88 \u00b1 0.98 \u00d7 103 cells/mg) (Figure 1C). The content of total \nF4/80+CD11c+ cells in fat pads from HFD CCR2KO mice was also \nlower than in obese controls after normalization to cell number \n(Figure 1B). Similar to what was observed previously (10), adipo-\ncyte size was increased in HFD CCR2KO mice compared with con-\ntrol HFD mice (mean 7,933 \u00b1 2,754 \u03bcm2 versus 6,704 \u00b1 2,961 \u03bcm2, \u2002\nP = 0.041) and HFD CCR2KO mice were protected from hepatic \nsteatosis (data not shown). Contrary to these observations, how-\never, we noted increased fat pad weight in HFD CCR2KO mice \u2002\n(2.83 \u00b1 0.57 g versus control, 1.41 \u00b1 0.25 g; P = 0.011).\nImmunofluorescence microscopy confirmed the flow cytometry \nresults; ND SVF cultures contained only F4/80+CD11c\u2013 cells (Fig-\nure 2A). SVF cells from HFD mice showed a mix of F4/80+CD11c+ \nand F4/80+CD11c\u2013 cells. Immunohistochemistry on epididymal \nfat pads from obese mice localized CD11c+ cells in macrophage \nclusters surrounding adipocytes (Figure 2B). The CD11c antibody \nstained a subset of cells in these crownlike structures, while F4/80 \nstained nearly all of the cells in these clusters. Scattered individual \nCD11c+ ATMs were observed surrounding adipocytes in what may \nhave been early ATM clusters (Figure 2C). Rare CD11c+ cells were \nseen in adipose tissue sections from lean mice.\nIncreased inflammatory gene expression in F4/80+CD11c+ ATMs. \nBecause CD11c+ cells appear to accumulate in adipose tissue after \nhigh-fat feeding, we assessed expression of inflammatory genes in \nF4/80+CD11c+ ATMs compared with F4/80+CD11c\u2013 ATMs from \nobese mice. Real-time RT-PCR showed appropriate sorting of the \nCD11c populations based on expression of integrin, alpha X (Itgax, \nencoding CD11c) (Figure 3). F4/80+CD11c+ cells overexpressed \nthe inflammatory genes Il6 (IL-6) and Nos2 (iNOS) compared with \nF4/80+CD11c\u2013 ATMs. Tnfa (TNF-\u03b1) was not differentially expressed \nbetween the cell types, while Apoe (apoE) was downregulated in the \nF4/80+CD11c+ population relative to F4/80+CD11c\u2013 cells.\nATMs from lean mice express markers of alternatively activated mac-\nrophages. Given the low level of inflammatory cytokine expression \nin adipose tissue from lean mice, we examined the ATMs derived \nfrom lean mice for known markers of alternatively activated M2 \nFigure 2\nCD11c+ ATMs in SVF cultures and in adipose tissue from obese mice. \n(A) Identification of F4/80+ and CD11c+ ATMs by immunofluorescence \nmicroscopy. Epididymal fat pads from ND and HFD mice were sepa-\nrated into adipocyte and SVF fractions. SVF cells were plated onto \nglass coverslips and cultured overnight prior to fixation. Cells were \nstained with antibodies against F4/80 (left) and CD11c (middle) and \nimaged by confocal microscopy to identify surface markers to confirm \nthe presence of CD11c+ cells only in the SVF from HFD-fed animals. \nSimilar results were obtained for 3 independent sets of cultures.

ATMs from lean animals showed increased \nexpression of M2-specific genes Il10 (IL-10), Arg1 (arginase I), Mrc2 \n(mannose receptor, C type 2), Ym1/Chi3l3 (Ym1/chitinase 3\u2013like 3),  \nand Mgl1/2 (macrophage galactose N-acetyl-galactosamine\u2013spe-\ncific lectins 1 and 2) compared with the ATMs isolated from HFD \nmice (Figure 4A). In contrast, expression of proinflammatory \ngenes such as Tnfa and Nos2 was considerably lower in ND ATMs \ncompared with ATMs from obese animals (Figure 4B).\nAs macrophages make up only a portion of the stromal cells in \nadipose tissue, we examined expression of some of these genes in \nunsorted SVF isolates. Similar patterns of gene expression were \nseen in RNA prepared from SVF cells from lean and obese mice \n(Figure 4, C and D), with increased Ym1 and Il10 expression in ND \nmice and increased Tnfa and Nos2 expression in HFD mice.\nSince inflammatory macrophage recruitment into fat tissue \nappears to be partially dependent on CCR2 (10), we hypothesized \nthat ATMs in obese CCR2KO mice might retain properties of \nM2-polarized macrophages and thus evaluated gene expression \nin these cells. Indeed, ATMs isolated from obese CCR2KO mice \nexpressed alternatively activated macrophage markers at levels that \nwere similar to those seen in ATMs from lean mice. Furthermore, \nthese were significantly elevated compared with levels in ATMs \nfrom obese mice (Figure 4A).\nWe confirmed gene expression data by examining protein lev-\nels in the ATMs under study. Consistent with the RNA expression \ndata, Ym1 was increased in SVF samples from lean compared with \nobese mice (Figure 4E). Additionally, purification of CD11b+ ATMs \nfrom SVF samples indicated that Ym1 is predominantly expressed \nin ATMs compared with non-macrophage CD11b\u2013 cells.\nAnother characteristic of the alternative macrophage activa-\ntion state is increased arginase activity (15). Arginase activity was \nassessed in SVF and adipocyte samples from lean and obese mice. \nWhile the activity of this enzyme did not differ between the iso-\nlated adipocytes from lean and obese mice, arginase activity was \nsignificantly diminished in the SVF fraction after HFD exposure \n(Figure 4F). This indicates that the arginase/iNOS balance in \nATMs from lean animals is skewed toward an immunosuppres-\nsive state that changes to a proinflammatory state with obesity \n(elevated iNOS and repressed arginase activity).\nIL-10 protects adipocytes from the deleterious effects of TNF-\u03b1. The \nobservation that the expression of Il10 is higher in the SVF and \nATMs from lean compared with obese mice led us to examine the \neffects of the cytokine on adipocyte function. To explore the cellu-\nlar effects of IL-10, we first examined the expression of its receptor. \nThe IL-10 receptor \u03b1 (IL-10R\u03b1) was detected in adipose tissue by \nimmunoblotting (Figure 5A). Separation of the SVF from adipo-\ncytes in lean and obese animals indicated that the IL-10 receptor \nwas expressed primarily in adipocytes, with minimal expression \nin the SVF (Figure 5B). No significant differences were seen in \u2002\nIL-10R\u03b1 expression between lean and obese mice.\nWe next examined IL-10 signaling in differentiated 3T3-L1 adi-\npocytes. STAT3 phosphorylation by the IL-10 receptor has been \nshown to be required for its antiinflammatory effects (24). Treat-\nment of adipocytes with IL-10 led to the tyrosine phosphorylation \nof STAT3 within 5 minutes. This effect peaked at 10 minutes and \ndeclined thereafter (Figure 5C). As IL-10 as been shown to activate \nthe PI3K pathway via insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins (25), \nwe examined phosphorylation of Akt in response to IL-10. IL-10 \ntreatment of adipocytes produced the rapid serine phosphoryla-\ntion of Akt (Figure 5C).\nIL-10 has a variety of antiinflammatory effects in macrophages \nand other cell types that includes the antagonism of the actions of \nTNF-\u03b1 (26). To examine this in adipocytes, we first analyzed the \neffect of IL-10 on the secretion of the chemokine MCP-1, thought \nto be a major attractant for macrophages in states of obesity (9, \n11, 27). IL-10 treatment for 16 hours decreased MCP-1 secretion \nfrom adipocytes (Figure 6A). As reports suggest that IL-10 may \nmediate its antiinflammatory effects by antagonizing activation \nof NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated gene transcription (28), we examined the \neffects of IL-10 on TNF-\u03b1\u2013stimulated NF-\u03baB activity using an \nNF-\u03baB\u2013responsive luciferase reporter gene. While TNF-\u03b1 induced \nreporter gene expression, IL-10 had no effect upon this activation \n(data not shown). This is consistent with other reports that show \nthat IL-10 can alter the transcriptional rate of inflammatory genes \nindependent of NF-\u03baB activation (29).\nWe next examined the effects of IL-10 on insulin signal \ntransduction in adipocytes in concert with TNF-\u03b1. Treatment \nof cells with TNF-\u03b1 for 6 hours dramatically reduced the levels \nof glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) protein, with a smaller reduc-\ntion in the level of insulin receptor expression, similar to what has \nbeen reported previously (30). IL-10 pretreatment prevented the \nTNF-\u03b1\u2013induced downregulation of both proteins (Figure 6B). \nAdditionally, insulin-stimulated IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation \nwas decreased with TNF-\u03b1 treatment. This inhibitory effect was \nprevented by pretreatment with IL-10 (Figure 6C). IL-10 treat-\nment produced no significant changes in TNF-\u03b1\u2013stimulated IRS1 \nphosphorylation at Ser307, suggesting that the antagonism of \u2002\nTNF-\u03b1 action by IL-10 occurs either downstream of or in parallel \nto reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1.\nTo determine whether IL-10 protects adipocytes from the physi-\nological effects of TNF-\u03b1, we examined insulin-stimulated glucose \nuptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with and without IL-10 pretreatment. \nTreatment of cells with TNF-\u03b1 for 3 hours produced a significant, \n30%\u201340% inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Pre-\ntreatment of the cells with IL-10 for 24 hours blocked these acute \ninhibitory effects of TNF-\u03b1 (Figure 7A). Prolonged (72-hour), low-\ndose TNF-\u03b1 treatment increased basal glucose uptake but had no \neffect on insulin-stimulated levels, consistent with a dramatic \nupregulation of the glucose transporter GLUT1 under these con-\nFigure 3\nIncreased inflammatory gene expression in F4/80+CD11c+ ATMs. SVF \ncells were isolated from HFD-fed male C57BL/6 mice (n = 3) and stained \nfor F4/80 and CD11c.

IL-10 blocked these effects of TNF-\u03b1 and maintained \ncells in an insulin-sensitive state (Figure 7B). Moreover, insulin-\nstimulated glucose uptake was dramatically enhanced in cells \nchronically treated with IL-10 compared with untreated cells.\nDiscussion\nRecent data suggest that obesity may represent a state of chron-\nic, low-grade inflammation and that overnutrition is associated \nwith the infiltration of adipose tissue by inflammatory cells (2). \nAlthough the precise cell types involved in this process remain \nuncertain, evidence is mounting that implicates ATMs as a sig-\nnificant contributor to inflammation in obesity and a mediator \nof insulin resistance (3, 9, 32). Because the properties of ATMs are \nnot well characterized, we performed a detailed examination of \nATM subtypes and their gene expression in obese and lean mice. \nBased on the wide range of functions that macrophages display in \nnormal and inflamed tissues (33), we hypothesized that ATMs are \ndifferentially activated depending on the degree of adiposity and, \nfurther, that in addition to quantitative differences, qualitative \ndifferences exist between ATMs in lean and obese animals.\nWe report here that ATMs isolated from white adipose tissue \nfrom lean animals express hallmarks of polarization toward an \nalternatively activated state (M2), suggesting a potentially ben-\neficial function of these cells. M2 polarization has been described \nin tumor-associated macrophages and parasitic infections and is \nbelieved to regulate tissue repair and prevent excess inflammation \n(15, 34). The markers of M2-polarized macrophages are still being \ndescribed but include expression of the chitinase family member \nYm1, the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10, arginase, and surface \nlectins Mgl1 and Mgl2 (15, 23). The genes encoding all of these pro-\nteins were overexpressed in ATMs from lean compared with obese \nmice. Moreover, ATMs from obese CCR2KO mice, which display \nsignificantly lower inflammatory gene expression compared with \ntheir wild-type counterparts, express M2 markers at levels compa-\nrable to those in lean mice. This observation is consistent with the \nevidence that resident tissue macrophages in normal conditions \nare derived from CCR2\u2013 monocytes, while macrophages recruited \nto sites of inflammation are derived from CCR2+ monocytes (20).\nIn the current paradigm of macrophage polarization, the prop-\nerties of M2 macrophages contrast with the proinflammatory \nactivities of classically activated M1 macrophages. One important \ndifference between these polarization states involves the balance \nbetween arginase and iNOS activities. Arginase and iNOS both uti-\nlize l-arginine as a substrate. However, while iNOS generates reac-\ntive NO species with microbicidal and proinflammatory effects \nimportant in immune responses, arginase competes with iNOS for \narginine as a substrate and generates l-ornithine, an important \nprecursor for proline that enhances collagen biosynthesis (16). \nFigure 4\nIncreased expression of markers of alternatively activated (M2) macrophages in ATMs from lean ND-fed mice.

This balance in favor of arginase \nmay play a critical role in repressing the generation of NO and \nother reactive oxygen species by iNOS and thus maintain adipo-\ncyte function and promote tissue repair and remodeling.\nThe dramatic differences in IL-10 expression in lean compared \nwith obese ATMs imply an important role for this cytokine as a \nhomeostatic regulator in insulin sensitivity. Acute IL-10 infusion \nwas shown to improve insulin sensitivity in whole animals (35), \nsuggesting that this molecule may balance the effects of proin-\nflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1. In humans, circulating IL-10 \u2002\nlevels correlate with markers of improved insulin sensitivity (36), \nand IL-10 levels increase along with insulin sensitivity after exer-\ncise (37). Polymorphisms in the IL-10 promoter associated with low \nIL-10 expression are correlated with increased obesity and insulin \nresistance (38). Additionally, adiponectin has been shown to induce \u2002\nIL-10 expression in human leukocytes (39). Studies have also shown \nthat in obese humans and rodents, both adipocyte and SVF com-\npartments from adipose tissue are significant sources of IL-10 (40). \nAs levels of proinflammatory cytokines are increased in obesity, \nthis observation is consistent with the hypothesis that a balance \nexists between proinflammatory and antiinflamma-\ntory factors that governs adipocyte function.\nIn vitro studies described here show that IL-10 \nprotects against TNF-\u03b1\u2013dependent insulin resis-\ntance in adipocytes. The mechanism underlying \nthis effect remains uncertain. In macrophages, \u2002\nIL-10 attenuates TNF-\u03b1 inflammatory signals via \nactivation of STAT3 (24) and modulation of inflam-\nmatory gene transcription rates (29). We have not \nobserved changes in TNF-\u03b1\u2013stimulated NF-\u03baB acti-\nvation with IL-10 in adipocytes, although we did \nobserve increased PI3K signaling with the cytokine. \nThis observation agrees with previous reports that \nIL-10 can activate PI3K pathways via IRS (25) and \nsuggests a possible mechanism by which IL-10 can \nantagonize the deleterious effects of TNF-\u03b1 on \ninsulin signaling in adipocytes.\nObesity leads to a shift in ATM phenotype exem-\nplified by increased Tnfa and Nos2 expression, \nboth characteristically activated in classically acti-\nvated M1 macrophages (4\u20136). We have identified a \nunique subset of ATMs present only in obese animals that express \nF4/80+CD11b+CD11c+. These cells overexpress inflammatory \ngenes compared with F4/80+CD11b+CD11c\u2013 ATMs and are the \nmajor ATM population that accumulates in fat with diet-induced \nobesity. These studies indicate a previously uncharacterized diver-\nsity within the ATM population in obese mice that may have \nimportant functional consequences.\nCD11c is a marker for DCs, which primarily function in \nphagocytosis, immune surveillance, and antigen presentation. \nF4/80+CD11c+ DCs have been termed interstitial dendritic cells; \nthey were recently described in a kidney network that is believed \nto participate in immune surveillance (41). How these DCs par-\nticipate in inflammatory signals in adipose tissue is unknown. \nIt is possible that DC activation is critical to the coordination of \ninflammatory events within fat tissue. An important role for DCs \nin obese adipose tissue is supported by the decreased expression of \nMHC class II genes in CCR2KO mice relative to controls (10).

These data suggest that DC-coordinated immunity may be \ncrucial to the inflammatory events in adipose tissue that occur \nwith obesity. Why such DCs are activated and what antigens they \nrespond to is currently unknown.\nExamining ATM infiltration into adipose tissue in the context \nof monocyte and macrophage heterogeneity leads us to propose \na model for ATM biology that incorporates the diversity of these \ncells (Figure 8). In lean animals, resident macrophages are polar-\nized toward an M2 state (high IL-10 and arginase levels) derived \nfrom CCR2\u2013 monocytes that help maintain normal adipocyte \nfunction, perhaps by promoting tissue repair and angiogenesis in \nadipose tissue. Nutrient excess leads to adipocyte expansion, with \nincreased secretion of monocyte chemoattractants that recruit \ninflammatory type CCR2+ monocytes to fat, where they differen-\ntiate into M1-polarized activated macrophages and CD11c+ DCs. \nAlternatively activated M2 macrophages may be able to partially \nprevent the activation and accumulation of these classically acti-\nvated M1 macrophages (43, 44), and the secretion of IL-10 helps \nprotect adipocytes against the deleterious effects of TNF-\u03b1 and \nrelated cytokines. However, with increasing adiposity, increased \nproinflammatory signals, continued recruitment of M1-polarized \nCCR2+ monocytes, and accumulation of CD11c+ ATMs all con-\ntribute to overwhelm the protective effects of M2 macrophages, \nleading to a dominant role for M1-polarized, classically activated \nmacrophages that generate high TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and NO production. \nThis model explains observations in obese CCR2KO and Mcp1/\nCcl2-KO mice that retain a population of ATMs with decreased \ninflammatory capacity (9, 10). We suspect that these KOs are \ndeficient in the recruitment of CCR2+ monocytes during inflam-\nmation in fat tissue, while the trafficking of CCR2\u2013 monocytes \nwith M2 polarization remains intact. Studies aimed at determin-\ning whether enhancing M2 polarization in ATMs can block diet-\ninduced insulin resistance will be required in order to test this \nmodel. One limitation of the data leading to this model is that \nthey are largely based on flow cytometric analysis of isolated SVF \npopulations after collagenase digestion. This method of separa-\ntion is an efficient one but may not fully capture all stromal cells \nfrom adipose tissue (5).\nHow diet-induced obesity leads to a change from M2 to M1 \npolarization is currently unknown, but the mechanism is likely \nmultifactorial. Our data suggest that the MCP-1/CCR2 axis con-\ntributes to this polarization. We propose 2 potential models for \nthis qualitative change in ATM activation: (a) Obesity may lead \nto an increase in the level of Ly-6ChiCCR2+ circulating monocytes \nthat are primed for activation along an M1 polarization pattern. \nFactors such as MCP-1, TNF-\u03b1, and free fatty acids that activate \nTLR4 (45) may combine to influence this activation pattern as \nthese monocytes enter adipose tissue. This model is supported \nby observations that obesity is associated with changes in acti-\nvation state of circulating monocytes toward a more proinflam-\nmatory phenotype (46, 47). (b) Alternatively, obesity may change \nATMs in adipose tissue from an M2 toward an M1 phenotype. \nMacrophages are reported to have the potential to switch from \none polarization state to another depending upon environmental \nstimuli (48). However, this model depends upon a slow turnover \nof ATMs. Studies involving pulse labeling macrophages in vivo \nindicated that ATMs are largely replaced by 8 weeks in HFD-fed \nmice (42). Additionally, we have observed that the ATMs recruit-\ned to adipose tissue in HFD-fed mice overexpress Ccr2 and other \nproinflammatory mediators. These observations are consistent \nwith the first hypothesis, according to which obesity leads to the \nrecruitment of M1-polarized macrophages that gradually replace \nM2-polarized cells, which represents the default pathway of acti-\nvation under lean conditions.\nOur study frames ATM biology within the context of other \nknown models of inflammation and macrophage recruitment. It \nmay be possible to decrease inflammatory signals in adipose tis-\nsue by modifying ATMs to retain an M2 polarization or by con-\nverting M1 polarized macrophages to M2. Increasing IL-10 levels \nmay represent one mechanism through which this could occur, \nsince chronic IL-10 secretion can suppress classically activated M1 \nmacrophages (49). Future investigations will focus on identifying \nFigure 7\nIL-10 prevents the effects of TNF-\u03b1 on blocking insulin-\nstimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes.

In lean, insulin-sensitive states, ATMs are polar-\nized toward an M2 state with IL-10 and arginase expression.

In these early stages of mild \nobesity with retained insulin sensitivity, M2-polarized resident ATMs are able to partially protect adipocytes from these inflammatory factors and \nmay block M1 polarization.

Relative expression was assessed by \nthe comparative CT method correcting for amplification efficiency of the \nprimers and performed in triplicate.\nImmunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates were prepared \nby the addition of lysis buffer (150 mM sodium chloride, 50 mM Tris \npH 8, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, \n10 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium \northovanadate, and protease inhibitors [complete Mini tablets; Roche \nApplied Science]). Cells were lysed at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes and clarified by \ncentrifugation. For immunoprecipitations, lysates were incubated with \n1 \u03bcg of anti-IRS1 antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C and immune complexes \nprecipitated with Protein A/G\u2013conjugated beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnol-\nogy Inc.). Beads were washed with lysis buffer and resuspended in sample \nbuffer. Lysates and immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, \ntransferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with primary antibod-\nies followed by species-specific HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. \nHRP activity was detected by chemiluminescence.\nImmunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded adipose tissue \nsections were deparaffinized and rehydrated prior to antigen unmasking \nby boiling in 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0, with 0.05% Tween-20 for 30 \nminutes. Sections were blocked in normal serum and incubated with pri-\nmary antibodies for durations of 1 hour to overnight. Endogenous HRP \nactivity was quenched with incubation with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 \nminutes. Secondary antibody staining was performed using the Vecta-\nstain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) and detected with 3,3\u2032-diaminoben-\nzidine (DAB). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin prior to \ndehydration and coverslip placement.\n2-Deoxyglucose uptake assay. Adipocytes were starved in low-glucose \nDMEM with 0.5% serum for 3 hours prior to insulin stimulation. 2-Deoxy-\nglucose uptake assays were performed as previously described (51).\nArginase assay. Arginase activity assays were performed as previously \ndescribed (52). Briefly, cells were lysed in 0.1% Triton X-100. Tris-HCl was \nadded to 12.5-mM and MnCl2 added to 1-mM final concentration. Argi-\nnase was activated by heating for 10 minutes at 56\u00b0C, and l-arginine sub-\nstrate was added to 250-mM final concentration. Reactions were incubated \nat 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes and stopped by the addition of H2SO4/H3PO4. \nAfter addition of \u03b1-isonitrosopropiophenone and heating for 30 minutes \nat 95\u00b0C, urea production was measured by absorbance at 540 nm and nor-\nmalized to total protein content.\nNF-\u03baB activation assay. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected with lucifer-\nase reporter plasmid pBIIX-luc (containing 2 tandemly repeated NF-\u03baB \nbinding sites) along with Renilla luciferase control (100:1; Promega) as \npreviously described (51). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were \ntreated with vehicle or TNF-\u03b1 (1 nM) with or without IL-10 (20 ng/ml) for \n16 hours prior to lysis and analysis using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter \nAssay System (Promega). Values were normalized to Renilla activities.\nStatistics. Results are presented as the mean \u00b1 1 SD. Statistical analyses \nwere conducted using an unpaired 2-tailed Student\u2019s t test, with signifi-\ncance set at a P value of less than 0.05.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the University of Michigan Immunology Core for help \nwith ELISA assays and the University of Michigan Flow Cytometry \nCore for their assistance with FACS analysis.

Here, we\ncomprehensively characterize the recently identified claudin-low tumor subtype.\nMethods: The clinical, pathological and biological features of claudin-low tumors were compared to the other\ntumor subtypes using an updated human tumor database and multiple independent data sets. These main\nfeatures of claudin-low tumors were also evaluated in a panel of breast cancer cell lines and genetically\nengineered mouse models.\nResults: Claudin-low tumors are characterized by the low to absent expression of luminal differentiation markers,\nhigh enrichment for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers, immune response genes and cancer stem cell-\nlike features. Clinically, the majority of claudin-low tumors are poor prognosis estrogen receptor (ER)-negative,\nprogesterone receptor (PR)-negative, and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (triple negative)\ninvasive ductal carcinomas with a high frequency of metaplastic and medullary differentiation. They also have a\nresponse rate to standard preoperative chemotherapy that is intermediate between that of basal-like and luminal\ntumors. Interestingly, we show that a group of highly utilized breast cancer cell lines, and several genetically\nengineered mouse models, express the claudin-low phenotype. Finally, we confirm that a prognostically relevant\ndifferentiation hierarchy exists across all breast cancers in which the claudin-low subtype most closely resembles\nthe mammary epithelial stem cell.\nConclusions: These results should help to improve our understanding of the biologic heterogeneity of breast\ncancer and provide tools for the further evaluation of the unique biology of claudin-low tumors and cell lines.\nIntroduction\nGenomic studies have established four major breast can-\ncer intrinsic subtypes (luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-\nenriched, basal-like) and a normal breast-like group that\nshow significant differences in incidence, survival and\nresponse to therapy [1-3]. However, as gene expression\nstudies evolve, further subclassification of breast tumors\ninto new molecular entities is expected to occur. In 2007,\nwe identified a new molecular subtype, referred to as\nclaudin-low, using 13 samples [5]. These distinct tumors\nwere found in both human and murine breast tumor data\nsets and were characterized by the low gene expression of\ntight junction proteins claudin 3, 4 and 7 and E-cadherin,\na calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion glycoprotein.\nMore recently, a tumor initiating cell (TIC) genomic sig-\nnature derived from CD44+/CD24-/low-sorted cells and\nmammospheres obtained from primary human breast\ntumors was found to be exclusively enriched by gene\nexpression in the claudin-low subtype [6,7], and the\nexpression of this CD44+/CD24-/low/claudin-low profile\nincreased in posttreatment samples after neoadjuvant\nchemotherapy or hormone therapy [7]. Overall, these\nstudies suggest that the claudin-low tumor subtype lacks\ncommon epithelial cell features and is enriched for TIC\nfeatures.\nIn this study, we comprehensively characterize the\nclaudin-low subtype using an updated human tumor\n* Correspondence: cperou@med.unc.edu\n\u2020 Contributed equally\n1Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, 450\nWest Drive, Chapel Hill, 27599, USA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nPrat et al.

The molecular characterization of the clau-\ndin-low intrinsic subtype in tumors and cell lines reveals\na breast cancer differentiation hierarchy that resembles\nthe normal epithelial mammary developmental cascade.\nMaterials and methods\nHuman breast tumor microarray data sets\nAll human tumor and normal tissue samples were col-\nlected using Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved\nprotocols and were obtained from fresh frozen invasive\nbreast carcinomas that were profiled as described pre-\nviously using oligo microarrays (Agilent Technologies,\nSanta Clara, CA, USA) [8]; we used all the microarrays\nfrom Herschkowitz et al. [5], Parker et al. [9] and Hen-\nnessy et al. [6], plus 39 new additional samples pre-\nsented here. All microarray and patient clinical data are\navailable in the University of North Carolina (UNC)\nMicroarray Database [10] and have been deposited in\nthe Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the acces-\nsion number GEO:GSE18229 (referred to here as the\nUNC337 set). The probes or genes for all analyses were\nfiltered by requiring the lowest normalized intensity\nvalues in both sample and control to be > 10. The nor-\nmalized log2 ratios (Cy5 sample/Cy3 control) of probes\nmapping to the same gene (Entrez ID as defined by the\nmanufacturer) were averaged to generate independent\nexpression estimates. In the resulting UNC337 matrix,\nno significant batch effects were observed. We also used\npublicly available microarray and patient clinical data\nfrom the following breast cancer data sets: NKI295\n[11,12],\nMDACC133\n[13]\nand\nNKI113\n[14].\nIn\nMDACC133, raw data were normalized using the robust\nmultiarray analysis (RMA) normalization approach. In\nall data sets, genes were median-centered within each\ndata set and samples were standardized to zero mean\nand unit variance before other analyses were performed.\nGene expression signatures\nWe analyzed the mean expression of multiple previously\npublished gene signatures [7,15-19]. Briefly, these signa-\ntures include leukocyte-related signatures from Palmer\net al. [17]: CD8 (n = 10 genes), B_Cell (n = 286), T_Cell\n(n = 178), and GRANS (n = 353). Stromal-related signa-\ntures were obtained from West et al. [16] (n = 402; DTF\nand SFT signatures combined) and Beck et al. [19] (n =\n174). Genes enriched more than twofold in mammo-\nsphere-derived cells compared with differentiated cells\nwere obtained from Dontu et al. [15] (n = 58). From Shi-\npitsin et al. [18], we calculated the mean expression of\nthe upregulated (n = 357) and downregulated (n = 353)\ngenes from CD44+ versus CD24+ breast cancer cells from\nmetastatic pleural effusions. From Creighton et al. [7], we\ncalculated the mean expression of the CD44+/CD24-/low/\nmammosphere signature reported (n = 119 upregulated\ngenes; n = 279 downregulated genes). Finally, the prolif-\neration and luminal gene cluster signatures were hand-\npicked (node correlation > 0.75) from the unsupervised\nintrinsic hierarchical clustering of the UNC337 using the\nintrinsic list of Parker et al. [9] and average linkage clus-\ntering using Cluster v2.12 (M. Eisen) [20] as shown in\nFigure S1 in Additional file 1. Gene lists from all genomic\nsignatures are displayed in Supplemental Data in Addi-\ntional file 2.\nBreast cancer cell line microarray data set\nWe analyzed a data set that included Affymetrix U133A\ngene expression microarrays of 52 breast cancer cell lines\n[21]. Raw data were normalized using RMA, and genes\nwere median-centered before analyses. Among the 52\nbreast cancer cell lines analyzed, DU4475, HCC1008 and\nHCC1599 cell lines were not included in Neve et al. [21].\nMouse breast tumor microarray data set\nAll mouse samples from the UNC were collected from\nfresh frozen invasive breast carcinomas as described pre-\nviously [5] using Agilent mouse oligo microarrays. Data\nnormalization and preprocessing were identical to that\ndescribed for the UNC337 data set. We used only sam-\nples (n = 104) from our previous publication that were\nincluded in 1 of the 10 mouse classes [5].\nClaudin-low and normal breast Euclidian centroid-based\npredictors\nTo robustly identify claudin-low samples, we built two\npredictors on the basis of either our human tumor data\nor the cell line data of Neve et al. [21]. To build a predic-\ntor, we first selected those genes that were significantly\ndifferentially expressed between claudin-low tumors\ndefined by SigClust [22] (or cell lines) and all other sub-\ntypes using a two-class, unpaired SAM, with < 5% false\ndiscovery rate (FDR). Then we used these gene lists and\ncalculated a claudin-low centroid and an \u201cothers\u201d cen-\ntroid from the training data. For every sample, we calcu-\nlated the Euclidean distances to the two centroids and\nassigned the class of the nearest centroid. Using the same\nmethodology, we also built a normal breast predictor by\nselecting those genes that were significantly differentially\nexpressed between normal breast tissues and breast\ntumors using a two-class, unpaired SAM, with 0% FDR.\nNote that these gene lists are also included in Supple-\nmental Data in Additional file 2.\nPrat et al.

Human claudin-low tumor samples were identified\nusing either SigClust [22] or the nine-cell line claudin-\nlow predictor. Samples identified by SigClust [22] or the\nnine-cell line claudin-low predictor were called claudin-\nlow, regardless of the PAM50 call. For breast cancer cell\nlines, the claudin-low subtype classification was based\non unsupervised hierarchical clustering using the intrin-\nsic list of Parker et al. [9] and the node identified in\nFigure S4 in Additional file 1. The complete gene list of\nthe nine-cell line claudin-low predictor can be found in\nSupplemental Data in Additional file 2.\nMammary developmental analyses\nPublic data sets from Raouf et al. [23] and Lim et al. [24]\nwere downloaded from GEO and assigned NCBI Entrez\ngene identifiers as available in GEO. Samples were scaled\nto mean zero and variance of 1. Features were then col-\nlapsed to the mean of each gene identifiers. In Lim et al.\n[24], three epithelial cell-enriched subpopulations were\nprofiled on DNA microarrays: mammary stem cells\n(MaSC), luminal progenitors (pL) and mature luminal\ncells (mL). We created a differentiation predictor for\neach sample as a measure of any sample\u2019s position along\na MaSC \u00ae pL \u00ae mL axis as defined by gene expression.\nDistance-weighted discrimination (DWD) was used to\ndetermine the direction of greatest variation from MaSC\nto pL and pL to mL. To map a sample onto this axis of\ndifferentiation, the pL centroid was set as the origin, and\nthe MaSC and mL centroids were transformed to length\n1 (sum of squares equals 1) to map a sample onto this\naxis of differentiation. Before mapping a sample onto this\naxis, it is assumed that the test data set covers the range\nof differentiation, which allows median centering of\ngenes to correct for platform bias. Test samples are then\nadjusted using the parameters for placing pL at the origin\nand are transformed to length 1. Each sample is then\nprojected onto the MaSC \u00ae pL axis and the pL \u00ae mL\naxis by calculating the inner product of the sample and\nthe MaSC or mL vectors identified by DWD. The differ-\nence of the two projected positions of each sample along\nthe MaSC \u00ae pL \u00ae mL axis is referred to as the differen-\ntiation score. In the UNC microarray database web site\n[10], we have provided the detailed R commands and\nfiles regarding the differentiation predictor.\nMammospheres from normal breast tissues\nFourteen normal breast tissues were dissociated mechani-\ncally and enzymatically as described in Stingl et al. [25].\nThe samples were procured and used according to\napproved IRB protocols for research in human subjects.\nMammospheres were cultured according to Dontu et al.\n[15], and single cells were plated onto ultralow attachment\nplates (Corning) at a density of 20,000 viable cells/ml.\nRNA was purified using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) after 14\nto 20 days in primary culture (first passage), and microar-\nrays were performed as described above.\nImmunohistochemistry\nFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections\n(~5 \u03bcm thick) were processed using standard immuno-\nhistochemistry methods as previously described [26].\nThe sections were incubated for 60 min at room tem-\nperature with primary antibody to claudin 3 (dilution\n1:100; Invitrogen, Catalog No. 18-7340) or E-cadherin\n(Clone No. ECH-6, pre-diluted; Cell Marque). The slides\nwere incubated for 45 min with diluted biotinylated sec-\nondary antibody (1:250 dilution) for 30 min with Vectas-\ntain Elite ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories). Sections\nwere incubated in peroxidase substrate solution for\nvisualization. Slides were counterstained with hematoxy-\nlin and examined by light microscopy. Tumor immunor-\neactivity was scored in a blinded fashion by two\ninvestigators (JIH and XH) into two categories: negative/\nweak positive and moderate/strong positive.\nImmunofluorescence\nFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections (~5 \u03bcm\nthick) were processed using standard immunostaining\nmethods as previously described [5]. The primary anti-\nbodies and their dilution were vimentin (mouse anti-\nvimentin IgG1-\u0001, dilution 1:100; Invitrogen, Catalog No.\n18-0052), keratin 5 (rabbit anti-human, dilution 1:500;\nAbcam, Catalog No. ab24647), and keratin 19 (Abcam,\nCatalog No. ab7754, mouse anti-human IgG2a; dilution\n1:200). Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence\nwere conjugated with Alexa Fluor-568 (Red, keratin 5\nand 19) or Alexa Fluor-488 (Green, vimentin) fluoro-\nphores (1:200; Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Dual posi-\ntivity was scored in a blinded fashion by XH into two\ncategories: negative meaning no dual positive cells and\npositive meaning the presence of dual positive cells.\nCell lines\nSUM159PT cells (Asterand) were maintained in Ham\u2019s\nF-12 medium with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), insulin\n(5 \u03bcg/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 \u03bcg/ml). MCF-7 was\ncultured in RPMI with 10% FBS [27], and SUM149PT\nwas maintained in HuMEC media with supplements\n(Gibco) with and without 5% FBS [28]. All cell lines\nwere grown at 37\u00b0C and 5% carbon dioxide.\nFluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and\nmicroarray analysis\nNonconfluent cell cultures were trypsinized and filtered\nto produce single cell suspension, counted, washed with\nPrat et al. Breast Cancer Research 2010, 12:R68\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/12/5/R68\nPage 3 of 18\nHanks\u2019 balanced salt solution (Stem Cell Technologies)\ncontaining 2% FBS and stained with antibodies specific\nfor human cell surface markers: EPCAM-fluorescein iso-\nthiocyanate (Stem Cell Technologies) and CD49f-\nphycoerythrin (BD Pharmingen). A total of 500,000 cells\nwere incubated with antibodies for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. Cells\nwere washed from unbound antibodies and immediately\nanalyzed using Beckman-Coulter (Dako) CyAn ADP or\nsorted using BD FACScan. RNA was purified from\nsorted cells using the RNeasy Mini kit, and microarrays\nwere performed as described above.\nStatistical analyses\nAll microarray cluster analyses were displayed using Java\nTreeview version 1.1.3. Average linkage hierarchical\nclustering was performed using Cluster v2.12 [20]. Bio-\nlogic analysis of microarray data was performed with the\nDAVID annotation tool [29]. ANOVA and Student\u2019s\nt-tests for gene expression data, Fisher\u2019s exact test for\nneoadjuvant clinical data, c2 tests for pathological data,\nand the Cox model were performed using R [30]. Survi-\nval curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method\nand compared by the log-rank test using WinStat\nv2007.1. Reported P values are two-sided.\nResults\nMolecular characterization of the claudin-low breast\ntumor subtype\nTo identify the molecular characteristics of claudin-low\ntumors, we created a large genomic data set by com-\nbining three of our previously published data sets\n[5,6,9] and included 37 new tumor samples (n = 337;\nUNC337, GEO series GSE18229). Hierarchical cluster-\ning analysis of this data set using the ~1,900 intrinsic\ngene list of Parker et al. [9] identified the major intrin-\nsic molecular subtypes, including the claudin-low sub-\ntype (Figure S1 in Additional file 1). The validity of\nthe claudin-low sample cluster was confirmed by par-\nsing the dendogram with SigClust [22] (P < 0.001);\nnotably, this clustering analysis placed the claudin-low\ntumors in close proximity to the basal-like subtype and\nwas composed of 32 arrays, representing 32 patients\n(~12% of all patients). Compared to the luminal A,\nluminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like subtypes,\nclaudin-low tumors showed inconsistent expression of\nbasal keratins (keratins 5, 14 and 17) and low expres-\nsion of HER2 and luminal markers such as ER, PR,\nGATA3, keratins 18 and 19 and the luminal gene clus-\nter (Figure 1a). Despite the apparent similarity to\nbasal-like tumors, claudin-low tumors as a group did\nnot show high expression of proliferation genes and\nthus are likely slower-cycling tumors. Indeed, signifi-\ncantly lower messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of\nthe cell cycle gene Ki67 was observed in claudin-low\ntumors when compared with basal-like tumors (P <\n0.0001, Student\u2019s t-test; Figure S2 and Table S1 in\nAdditional file 1).\nTo better characterize the claudin-low molecular sub-\ntype, we identified those genes differentially expressed in\nclaudin-low tumors compared with other tumors or\nsubtypes. We found 1,308 and 359 genes significantly\nhigher and lower in expression in claudin-low tumors,\nrespectively (Table S2 in Additional file 1). Overall, clau-\ndin-low tumors highly expressed genes involved in\nimmune system response (i.e. CD79b, CD14 and vav1),\ncell communication (chemokine [C-X-C motif] ligand\n12), extracellular matrix (vimentin, fibroblast growth\nfactor 7), cell differentiation (Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 2,\ninterleukin 6), cell migration (integrin a5, moesin) and\nangiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor C,\nmatrix metallopeptidase 9) [29]. Conversely, expression\nof various epithelial cell-cell adhesion genes such as\nclaudin 3, claudin 4, claudin 7, occludin and E-cadherin\nwas significantly lower as previously reported [5] (Figure\n1b). Further immunohistochemical analysis of 103 breast\ntumors of the UNC337 data set revealed that compared\nto the basal-like subtype, the claudin-low tumor subtype\nhad a preponderance for low to absent expression of\nE-cadherin and claudin 3 (45% vs. 11% for E-cadherin,\nP < 0.05; 59% vs. 11% for claudin 3, P < 0.005; c2 test).\nSimilarly, when compared to all other tumors (basal-\nlike, HER2-enriched, luminal A, luminal B and normal\nbreast-like) as a single group, the claudin-low tumor\nsubtype maintained its characteristic for low to absent\nexpression of E-cadherin and claudin 3 (45% vs. 15% for\nE-cadherin, P < 0.005; 59% vs. 22% for claudin 3, P <\n0.001; c2 test) (Figure S3 in Additional file 1).\nConcordant with the expression of markers of\nmesenchyme and immunity, we observed high expres-\nsion of stromal-specific and lymphocyte- or granulocyte-\nspecific gene signatures in claudin-low tumors compared\nto the other intrinsic subtypes [16,17,19] (Figure 1b,\nFigure S2 in Additional file 1). These findings, together\nwith the low expression of epithelial cell-cell adhesion\nmolecules such as E-cadherin, are consistent with an\nEMT (changes in cell phenotype between epithelial and\nmesenchymal states) [31] in claudin-low tumors and a\npotential recruitment of multiple types of leukocytes\ninto these tumors.\nWe next explored the mRNA expression of the TIC\ngene markers CD44 and CD24 and cell surface markers\nof epithelial differentiation such as MUC1, CD49f, and\nepithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) across the\nintrinsic subtypes (basal-like, claudin-low, luminal A,\nluminal B, HER2-enriched) and the normal breast-like\ngroup to determine their differentiation status. Overall,\nclaudin-low tumors showed low mRNA expression of\ndifferentiated luminal cell surface markers (CD24,\nPrat et al. Breast Cancer Research 2010, 12:R68\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/12/5/R68\nPage 4 of 18\nEpCAM and MUC1), while markers CD44 and CD49f\nwere higher when compared to differentiated luminal\ntumors (P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t-test; Figure 1c, Figure S2\nin Additional file 1). The expression pattern of these\ngene markers is concordant with CD44+/CD24-/low and\nCD49f+/EpCAM-/low antigenic phenotypes, which have\nbeen previously shown to be enriched in breast TICs\n[32,33] and mammary stem cells (MaSCs) [24]. Second,\nwe observed that claudin-low tumors compared to the\nother tumor subtypes, except for the normal breast-like\ngroup, showed the highest mRNA expression of\nALDH1A1, which has recently been proposed to be\nanother marker of breast stem cells and TICs [34] but\nalso noted in stromal cells [24,34,35]. Conversely, basal-\nlike tumors did not show significantly lower expression\nof CD24 as a group, nor did they show high mRNA\nexpression of ALDH1A1 (Figure 1b and Figure S2 in\nAdditional file 1). This contrasts with other studies that\nhave linked the basal-like subtype with stem cell- or\nembryonic cell-like features [36,37]; however, these\nFigure 1 Average expression of important genes and gene signatures across the intrinsic breast cancer subtypes.

P values shown were calculated by\ncomparing gene expression means across all subtypes.\nPrat et al. Breast Cancer Research 2010, 12:R68\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/12/5/R68\nPage 5 of 18\nother studies did not examine claudin-low tumors as a\nseparate group, and in the absence of a claudin-low pre-\ndictor, claudin-low tumors are typically classified as\nbasal-like (or normal breast-like) by the PAM50 gene\nexpression assay [9].\nTo further explore the potential enrichment for breast\nstem cells and TIC features, we evaluated the expression\nof three breast stem cell-like signatures [7,15,18] across\nthe different subtypes. All signatures were highly\nenriched (P < 0.0001, Student\u2019s t-test; Supplementary\nMaterial in Additional file 2) in the claudin-low subtype\ndespite the various derivations used of each signature\n(Figure 1c, Figure S2 in Additional file 1). Interestingly,\nthese three stem cell-like signatures were representative\nof distinct gene expression subsets, among which < 10%\nof the genes overlapped. These data suggest that differ-\nent biological processes associated with TICs converge\nin the claudin-low tumor subtype.\nIdentification of the claudin-low profile in a panel of\nbreast cancer cell lines\nTo investigate if potential in vitro counterparts for these\ntumors exist, we analyzed a data set of 52 breast cancer\ncell lines [21] by hierarchical cluster analysis using our\nmost recent human breast tumor intrinsic classification\nlist [9]. The three major subgroups (luminal, basal B\nand basal A) identified previously by Neve et al. [21]\nwere evident, with nine basal B cell lines clustering\ntogether with a node correlation of 0.59 (Figure S4 in\nAdditional file 1). These cell lines showed low expres-\nsion of the ER, HER2 and claudin 3, claudin 4 and clau-\ndin 7 (Figure S4 in Additional file 1). We identified\nthose genes whose expression distinguished each human\ntumor subtype using significance analysis of microarrays\n(SAM) in our UNC337 tumor database, including a list\ndefining the normal breast-like group (Figure 2a). These\nnine cell lines (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-436, Hs578T,\nBT549, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, SUM1315MO2,\nSUM159PT and HBL100) showed a gene expression\npattern similar to the claudin-low tumor subtype with\nthe lowest expression of genes involved in epithelial\ncell-cell adhesion (i.e., E-cadherin and claudins 3, 4 and\n7), luminal differentiation (i.e., CD24, EpCAM) and high\nvalues for the CD44/CD24 and CD49f/EpCAM mRNA\nratios (Figure S4, Table S3 in Additional file 1). To com-\nplement these clustering analyses, we developed a clau-\ndin-low centroid-based predictor using the UNC337\ntumor data set and the SigClust-defined claudin-low\ngroup versus all others, and objectively classified the 52\ncell lines as claudin-low or not; as expected, the human\nFigure 2 Identification of the claudin-low subtype in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. Gene clusters that characterize each primary\nhuman tumor subtype are shown in the human and cell line gene expression data sets. In both data sets, array trees have been derived by\nunsupervised hierarchical clustering using the intrinsic list from Parker et al. [9] as shown in Figure S1A and S4A in Additional file 1. (a) The top\n50 upregulated genes associated with each molecular subtype, including the top 50 downregulated genes in claudin-low tumors, are shown in\nthe UNC337 database.

Breast Cancer Research 2010, 12:R68\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/12/5/R68\nPage 6 of 18\ntumor-based claudin-low predictor identified these nine\ncell lines as claudin-low (Figure S5 in Additional file 1).\nThe gene cluster that identifies the in vivo defined\nnormal\nbreast-like\ngroup\nwas\nnot\ndifferentially\nexpressed by any of the 52 cell lines, suggesting overall\nthat none of these cell lines show a normal breast-like\nphenotype (Figure 2b). The normal breast-like group of\nprimary specimens is usually composed of actual nor-\nmal breast samples and a small number of primary\ntumors [9,38], the latter of which we believe show the\nhigh expression of true normal tissue genes due to sig-\nnificant normal breast contamination [9]. In cell culture,\nhowever, there is no such contamination by normal\nepithelial or nonepithelial cells, and thus this lack of\ncontamination may explain why normal breast-like\ntumor cell lines are not identified as such by the clus-\ntering. To be more objective, we applied a normal\nbreast centroid-based predictor (normal breast versus all\ntumors using the UNC337 database) to the cell line\ndata, and no cell line was classified as normal breast\n(Figure S5 in Additional file 1). Contamination with\nother tissues or cells is not uncommon in other tumor\nsubtypes [1]. For example, within the top highly\nexpressed genes in claudin-low tumors versus all others,\nthere are several wound response-related genes (i.e.,\nCD28, CD52) that are not expressed by the breast can-\ncer cell lines (Figure 2b), potentially due to significant\nimmune or stromal cell content in the tumor. Overall,\nthese data suggest that the nine previously described\nbreast cancer cell lines are most similar to claudin-low\ntumors in in vivo specimens.\nBuilding a Cell-line claudin-low centroid-based predictor\nBecause primary human claudin-low tumors are highly\nenriched for immune system genes (and lymphocytes)\nwhen supervised analyses are performed, the expression\nof nonepithelial cell genes would likely increase the false\npositivity of the human claudin-low predictor when\napplied to other tumor data sets, because, for instance,\ntumors would be called claudin-low or not based upon\nthe high expression of immune cell genes. Therefore, we\ndeveloped a claudin-low centroid-based predictor using\nthe cell line database of Neve et al. [21]. First, we evalu-\nated its accuracy by applying the predictor onto our\nhuman tumor database (UNC337). The nine-cell line\nclaudin-low predictor identified 37 samples (~11%) as\nclaudin-low, including the 28 claudin-low samples pre-\nviously identified by hierarchical clustering. The remain-\ning nine samples identified by the predictor were\npreviously called basal-like (n = 7), normal breast-like (n\n= 1) and HER2-enriched (n = 1) by the PAM50 predic-\ntor [9]. Overall, the nine-cell line claudin-low predictor\nshowed 87.5% sensitivity, 97.0% specificity, and 75.7%\nand 98.7% positive and negative predictive values,\nrespectively, if the SigClust-defined claudin-low group is\nconsidered the gold standard.\nWe then used the nine-cell line claudin-low predic-\ntor to identify this subtype in a mouse tumor database\n[5], which represents 13 different mouse models\ngrouped in 10 different classes on the basis of their\ngene expression profiles (Groups I to X). Interestingly,\nall claudin-low samples identified by the centroid pre-\ndictor (n = 9) were included in Group II, which we\npreviously highlighted for its mesenchymal features\n(i.e., spindle-shaped cells). These nine murine claudin-\nlow tumor samples were derived from six different\nmouse models (Brca1Co/Co;TgMMTV-Cre;p53+/-,\nDMBA-induced,\np53-/-\ntransplant,\np53+/-\nIR,\nTgMMTV-Neu and TgWAP-T121) and overall showed\nsimilar enrichment for EMT markers and human\nmesenchymal and stem cell-like signatures, including\ndecreased expression of proliferative- and luminal-\nassociated genes (Figure S6 in Additional file 1). No\nmurine normal mammary tissue sample was classified\nas claudin-low. These analyses suggest that a cell line\ncentroid-based approach, by focusing on genes\nexpressed in epithelial cells only, might give more\naccurate classification of tumors, which could be evalu-\nated in future studies focused on tumor subtyping.\nClinical-pathological characteristics of claudin-low\nbreast tumors\nTo determine for the first time the clinical-pathological\ncharacteristics of human claudin-low breast tumors, we\nevaluated our breast cancer patient database (UNC337)\nand two independent gene expression data sets (NKI295\nand MDACC133) [11-13] using the nine-cell line clau-\ndin-low predictor and the previously published PAM50\nsubtype predictor (Figure 3a) because these two objec-\ntive centroid predictors have been demonstrated to be\nthe most robust to classify breast tumors into discrete\nsubtypes. Across all three databases, claudin-low tumors\nshowed a prevalence of 7 to 14%, and were mostly ER-/\nPR-/HER2- (also known as triple-negative tumors, 61 to\n71%). Conversely, the majority of triple-negative tumors\nwere either basal-like (39 to 54%) or claudin-low (25 to\n39%), followed by HER2-enriched (7 to 14%), luminal B\n(4 to 7%), luminal A (4 to 5%) and normal breast-like\n(1%). In terms of prognosis, Kaplan-Meier survival ana-\nlysis revealed that claudin-low tumors have a worse\nprognosis compared to luminal A tumors in both the\nUNC337 (hazard ratio [HR] of 2.83 and 5.66 for\nrelapse-free survival [RFS] and overall survival [OS],\nrespectively; P < 0.05) and NKI295 data sets (HR of 4.71\nand 17.98 for RFS and OS, respectively; P < 0.001). Con-\nversely, similar survival curves were observed between\nclaudin-low tumors and the other poor prognosis sub-\ntypes such as luminal B, HER2-enriched and basal-like\nPrat et al. Breast Cancer Research 2010, 12:R68\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/12/5/R68\nPage 7 of 18\ntumors (Figure 3b). Normal breast-like samples were\nomitted from survival analyses because they are likely\nsignificantly contaminated by normal breast tissue, and\nthus their true tumor biology is masked.\nWe also evaluated the potential association between\nclaudin-low tumors and treatment response by using the\nMDACC breast cancer patient data set (133 pretreated\nsamples) of tumors treated with neoadjuvant anthracy-\ncline/taxane-based chemotherapy [13]. Notably, claudin-\nlow tumors showed a lower pathological complete\nresponse (pCR) rate after anthracycline/taxane-based\nchemotherapy compared to basal-like tumors (38.9% vs.\n73.3% pCR rates; P = 0.08, Fisher\u2019s exact test), but their\npCR rate was higher than luminal A or B tumors;\ninterestingly, the apparent pCR rate of the basal-like\ntumors increased from 59% (reported in Parker et al. [9])\nto ~73% when the claudin-low subtype was included,\nbecause among 18 claudin-low tumors identified in this\nset, 12 (67%) of 18 of them were previously identified as\nbasal-like and the response rate of this subgroup of\npatients was 41.7%. These findings suggest that claudin-\nlow tumors show some chemotherapy sensitivity but\noverall have a poor prognosis and may not be managed\neffectively with existing chemotherapy regimens.\nTwenty-one claudin-low samples were examined his-\ntologically by a pathologist (CL; Table S4 in Additional\nfile 1) to further clinically characterize claudin-low\ntumors. Among the samples evaluated, 9 (43%) of 21\nFigure 3 Clinical and pathological characteristics and prognosis of all intrinsic subtypes, including claudin-low tumors, across three\nindependent breast cancer data sets.

The remaining 12 samples (12 of 21, 57%) were\ninvasive ductal carcinomas not otherwise specified.\nOverall, lymphoid infiltration was evident in a total of\nseven samples (total of 7 of 19, 37%), which might\nexplain the high mRNA expression of immune response\ngenes present in these tumors. Among the other clau-\ndin-low samples that could not be examined histologi-\ncally (n = 16), 50% (8/16) had a previous diagnosis of\nmetaplastic tumors. It is interesting to note that two\nclaudin-low cell lines, Hs578T and MDA-MB-157, were\nderived from metaplastic [39] and medullary [40]\ncarcinomas.\nSince the pathological examination of claudin-low\ntumors identified special histological features, we applied\nthe nine-cell line claudin-low predictor to a publicly\navailable database of histologically diverse subtypes of\nbreast cancer (n = 113, NKI113) [14], which includes 10\nmedullary carcinomas, 20 metaplastic carcinomas and\n22 invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC). Indeed, 8 (57%) of\n14 and 2 (14%) of 14 claudin-low samples were identi-\nfied as metaplastic and medullary carcinomas, respec-\ntively (Figure 4f and Table S5 in Additional file 1).\nConversely, only 2 of a total of 22 ILCs were identified\nas claudin-low despite the lack of E-cadherin expression\nin lobular tumors [41].\nClaudin-low subtype resembles the MaSC profile\nWe hypothesized, as did Lim et al. [24], that a mam-\nmary differentiation program starting from a MaSC \u00ae\nluminal progenitor (pL) \u00ae mature luminal cells (mLs)\nexists, and therefore we built a differentiation model\nusing data from Lim et al. [24]. For this predictor,\nhigher scores represent greater differentiation status\nalong this axis that culminates in ER+ mLs (Figure 4a).\nFirst, we applied this predictor onto similar subpopula-\ntions of purified human mammary epithelial cells that\nwere separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting\n(FACS) and profiled as part of the independent study\nof Raouf et al. [23] using different surface makers (Fig-\nure S7 in Additional file 1). The differentiation predic-\ntor showed 100% (8 of 8) accuracy with the bipotent\nprogenitor subpopulation from Raouf et al.

[24]), followed by the\nluminal-restricted progenitor [CD49f+(MUC1/CD133)\n+(CD10/THY1)-] and then the mLs [CD49f-(MUC1/\nCD133)+(CD10/THY1)-]. In addition, we established\nand\nexpression-profiled\nmammosphere\ncultures\nobtained from 14 different normal breast tissues\nbecause these cultures enrich for cells with stem or\nself-renewal capacity [15]. As expected, mammospheres\nshowed a low differentiation score close to the MaSC\nprofile (Figure 4b).\nNotably, and as shown by Lim et al. [24], the breast\ncancer subtypes segregate along the normal mammary\nepithelial differentiation hierarchy starting with undif-\nferentiated claudin-low tumors, followed by basal-like,\nthen HER2-enriched tumors, and finally both luminal\ntumor subtypes (Figure 4c). As expected, we observed\nthe same pattern using the breast cancer cell line data\n[21] (Figure 4d). Conversely, the nine-cell line claudin-\nlow predictor identified the MaSC and stromal\n(CD49flow/EpCAM-) subpopulations of Lim et al. [24]\nas claudin-low, and as expected, both subpopulations\nshowed the highest and lowest expression of the up-\nand downregulated genes that define the nine-cell line\nclaudin-low predictor (Figure S8 in Additional file 1).\nMoreover, we applied the differentiation predictor to\nthe mouse data set of Herschkowitz et al. [5] (Figure\n4e) and observed that the previously identified claudin-\nlow murine samples scored the lowest, while the\nMMTV-Neu and MMTV-PyMT models, which are\nknown luminal mammary adenocarcinoma models,\nscored the highest. In addition, among 113 histological\nspecial types of breast cancer [14], medullary, adenoid\ncystic and metaplastic tumors showed the lowest score\nin the differentiation axis (Figure 4f), which is consis-\ntent with our previous reports of commonalities\nbetween metaplastic carcinomas, claudin-low tumors\nand breast cancer TICs [6].\nFinally, we evaluated the prognostic ability of the\ndifferentiation predictor in the UNC337 and NKI295\nbreast cancer patient data sets. Low differentiation\nscores were statistically significantly associated with\npoorer RFS and OS in univariate (Figure 5a) and mul-\ntivariate analyses after adjusting for the main clinical-\npathological parameters (i.e., size, grade, node and ER\nstatus), including tumor subtype (Figure 5b). These\ndata suggest that tumors with an undifferentiated\nphenotype similar to the normal MaSC and/or early\nprogenitors have a poorer prognosis compared to\ntumors with a more mature luminal phenotype, and\nthis association is independent of the luminal B and\nHER2-enriched subtypes and the common clinical\nvariables.\nClaudin-low and basal-like tumors are enriched with\nundifferentiated or mesenchymal cells\nNext, we sought to determine whether tumor cells with\nundifferentiated or mesenchymal features (as defined by\nimmunofluorescence) exist within the different breast\ncancer intrinsic subtypes, similar to that performed by\nCreighton et al. [7]. Eighty-six breast tumors and one\nnormal breast sample from the UNC337 database,\nincluding 20 claudin-low tumors, were evaluated using\ndual immunofluorescence (IF) staining with epithelial\n(keratin 5/19) and mesenchymal (vimentin) markers.\nStaining of the normal breast sample revealed that the\nantibody to vimentin stains the mesenchyme or stroma,\nwhereas the antibody to keratin 5/19 stains the ducts,\nand no dual positive cells were seen (Figure 6). Conver-\nsely, 33% (28 of 86) of all tumor samples showed some\ndegree of dual positivity, but 89% (25 of 28) of all sam-\nples with dual immunofluorescence positivity were\neither claudin-low (n = 11) or basal-like (n = 14). The\nremaining dual positive samples were identified in the\nHER2-enriched (n = 1) and luminal A subtypes (n = 2).\nClaudin-low tumors showed higher percentages of dual\npositive tumors than the other tumor subtypes when\nthese are considered as a group (55% vs. 26%; P = 0.014,\nc2 test); however, no statistically significant differences\nin dual positivity were observed between claudin-low\nand basal-like tumors (55% vs. 78%; P = 0.14, c2 test).\nThese data show that some epithelial tumor cells\nexpress mesenchymal features, these features are not\ndue to contamination by adjacent stromal cells and\nalmost all tumors with these features are basal-like or\nclaudin-low tumors.\nWe attempted to identify undifferentiated/mesenchy-\nmal epithelial cells within breast cancer cell lines. First,\nwe analyzed the expression of surface markers CD49f\nand EpCAM (chosen based upon the studies of Lim et\nal. [24]) in three different cell lines: MCF-7 (luminal),\nSUM149PT (basal-like) and SUM159PT (claudin-low)\n(Figure 7). As expected on the basis of our previous\ngenomic analysis of the differentiation status of these\ncell lines, virtually all claudin-low SUM159PT cells\nshowed a stromal or MaSC antigenic phenotype (CD49f\n+/EpCAM-), ~98% of MCF-7 cells showed a mL pheno-\ntype (CD49f-/low/EpCAM+), and ~83% of SUM149PT\ncells showed a pL phenotype (CD49f+/EpCAM+/high).\nAbout 10% and ~2% of cells from SUM149PT and\nMCF-7 cell lines, respectively, showed low expression of\nEpCAM, suggesting that some cells within basal-like\nand luminal cell lines might have a more undifferen-\ntiated state. However, a clear EpCAM-/low subpopulation\nwas identified only in the SUM149PT cell line.\nTo further determine the differentiation status of the\nvarious cell subpopulations within MCF-7 (CD49f-/\nEpCAM+, CD49f+/EpCAM+, and CD49f-/lowEpCAM-/low),\nPrat et al.

Conver-\nsely, the CD49f+/EpCAM-/low cells from the basal-like\nSUM149PT cell line showed the presence of a mesenchy-\nmal/claudin-low-like gene expression profile, with\nFigure 7 FACS of breast cancer cell lines and characterization of their differentiation status.

Since both clau-\ndin-low (CD49f+/EpCAM-/low) and basal-like (CD49f+/high/\nEpCAM+) cells exist within the SUM149PT cell line, we\nwished to determine whether one cell type gave rise to the\nother. When sorted and plated separately, 5 to 10% of the\nCD49f+/EpCAM-/low SUM149PT cells differentiated\ninto CD49f+/high/EpCAM+ basal-like cells, whereas the\nCD49f+/high/EpCAM+ basal-like cells maintained their dif-\nferentiated status during in vitro culture (Figure 7d).\nDiscussion\nHere, claudin-low tumors were comprehensively charac-\nterized, and many important biological and clinical fea-\ntures were identified. Specifically, we addressed four\ntopics for claudin-low tumors including (1) molecular\nfeatures, (2) clinical and histological characteristics, (3)\nrelation to established breast cancer cell lines and\ngenetically engineered mouse models and (4) differentia-\ntion status based on analyses of purified normal mam-\nmary epithelial cell subpopulations.\nMolecular characterization of the claudin-low sub-\ntype reveals that these tumors are significantly enriched\nin EMT and stem cell-like features while showing a low\nexpression of luminal and proliferation-associated\ngenes. Among these molecular characteristics, EMT\nand stem cell features have recently been linked to one\nanother [18,33,42,43]. Indeed, expression of EMT-indu-\ncing transcription factors SNAI1 [33] or TWIST1 [33]\nor repression of E-cadherin [43] in mammary epithelial\ncells increases the number of stem cells, and these and\nother EMT-inducing transcription factors such as\nZEB2 and TWIST2, as well as the mesenchymal\nmarker vimentin, are expressed at higher levels in\nCD44+CD24-/low stem cell-like cells than in more dif-\nferentiated epithelial CD44-CD24+ cells [18,33]. Consis-\ntent with this finding, we observed a high mRNA\nexpression of known transcriptional repressors of E-\ncadherin such as SNAI1, SNAI2, TWIST1, TWIST2,\nZEB1 and ZEB2, and other EMT-inducing factors such\nas hypoxia-inducible factor-1a in claudin-low tumors\n[31] (Figure 1b, Figure S2 in Additional file 1). Thus,\nour data suggest that claudin-low tumors, compared\nwith the other intrinsic breast tumor subtypes, are the\nmost enriched for stem cell and/or TIC features, and\non the basis of our vimentin immunofluorescence\nstaining, it appears that these mesenchymal features\nare present within epithelial cells, which is a feature\nnot seen in normal breast tissues.\nAcquisition of EMT and/or stem cell-like biological\nprocesses has been associated with therapeutic resis-\ntance [7,43,44]. We observed that claudin-low tumors\ndo show a lower pCR rate than basal-like tumors (Fig-\nure 3a); however, the pCR rate of claudin-low tumors\nwas roughly equivalent to that of the HER2-enriched\nsubtype (without anti-HER2 therapies) and much higher\nthan luminal A or luminal B tumors. Thus, as has been\ndescribed for basal-like tumors [4], claudin-low tumors\nshow some chemotherapy sensitivity, yet patients with\nthese tumors still have poor survival outcomes overall\n(Figure 3b). A potential explanation for this similar sce-\nnario of basal-like and claudin-low tumors is that che-\nmoresistant cells with TIC or mesenchymal properties\nare present at diagnosis in these two tumor subtypes as\nsuggested by our immunofluorescence dual staining\n(Figure S9 in Additional file 1). This is also in concor-\ndance with a previous immunohistochemical study of\n491 breast tumors where high expression of mesenchy-\nmal markers (i.e., vimentin, N-cadherin) and low expres-\nsion of CDH1 were found almost exclusively in the\ntriple-negative subgroup of tumors [45]. However, our\ntreatment response data suggest that these tumor cells\nwith mesenchymal properties within basal-like and clau-\ndin-low subtypes might not have the same treatment\nsensitivity to anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy.\nThus, further studies are needed to better characterize\nthe treatment sensitivity of claudin-low and basal-like\ntumors to specific chemotherapeutics and/or targeted\ntherapies. The claudin-low nine-cell line centroid pre-\ndictor developed here will assist immediately in identify-\ning the claudin-low subtype and its possible predictive\nvalue in any neoadjuvant clinical trial with associated\nmicroarray data. However, we acknowledge a potential\ncaveat of the nine-cell line claudin-low predictor, which\nis that tumors with high stromal content might also be\nidentified as claudin-low. It is possible that the signature\nset of genes that are high in claudin-low tumors (and\ncell lines) are also high in nonepithelial cells, including\nfibroblasts and other mesenchyme-derived cells. Thus,\nwe cannot rule out the possibility that some of the clau-\ndin-low tumors identified in this study are tumors with\nlow epithelial and high myofibroblast content. It is also\npossible that this signature is one that can occur within\nepithelial cells, within stromal cells, or both. Special\nattention to the percentage of tumor cellularity of the\nsample being analyzed and/or strategies that can differ-\nentiate tumor cells with mesenchymal properties (i.e.,\nimmunoflourescence assays) from normal or tumor-\nassociated fibroblasts with mesenchymal properties are\nneeded for the further evaluation of this signature.\nFinally, from a translational point of view, it is interest-\ning to note that the publicly available NCI-60 in vitro\ndrug-screening database includes six breast cancer cell\nPrat et al. Breast Cancer Research 2010, 12:R68\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/12/5/R68\nPage 14 of 18\nlines, four of which are claudin-low (BT549, MDA-MB-\n231, MDA-MB-435 and Hs578T) and two of which are\nluminal (MCF-7 and T47D). Among them, MDA-MB-\n435 cells have been shown to have melanoma character-\nistics [46], which is still a controversial topic [47].\nNonetheless, there is a need to develop better screening\nprograms of drug sensitivity in breast cancer cell lines\nthat resemble the basal-like subtype, as this subtype is\nmissing from the NCI-60 set.\nInvasive ductal, metaplastic and medullary or medul-\nlary-like claudin-low carcinomas share important biolo-\ngical relationships as defined by gene expression,\nsuggesting that yet to be discovered common oncogenic\nchanges might exist. Metaplastic and medullary carcino-\nmas both have a high incidence of methylation of\nBRCA1 [48,49], and ~50% of breast tumors from\nBRCA1 mutation carriers show medullary-like features\n[50]. In addition, MDA-MB-436 and SUM1315MO2\nclaudin-low cell lines have mutations in BRCA1 [51].\nMoreover, we have shown that BRCA1 mutant basal-\nlike SUM149PT cell line has a small subpopulation of\ncells with mesenchymal/claudin-low-like features, and\nthat these cells give rise to the basal-like cells that domi-\nnate these cultures. These data suggest that BRCA1 defi-\nciency, which has been implicated in the differentiation\nof MaSC or bipotent progenitors into ER-positive lumi-\nnal cells [52], might also contribute to the development\nor progression of undifferentiated claudin-low tumors\nand cell lines.\nAlthough we have not performed functional tumor\ncell repopulating assays on human claudin-low tumors\nto show their enrichment for TICs because of the low\nincidence of these tumors (i.e., ~7 to 14%), there is,\nhowever, evidence that the claudin-low cell lines identi-\nfied here show stem cell properties and may be highly\nenriched for TICs. For example, Charafe-Jauffret et al.\n[53] reported that in addition to having EMT features\nand high expression of stem cell markers such as\nALDH1, many of these cell lines contain functional\nTICs. This is in concordance with another report [54]\nthat showed that MDA-MB-231, SUM159PT and\nSUM1315MO2 have a high proportion (>90%) of CD44\n+/CD24-/low cells, and that the CD44+/CD24-/low subpo-\npulation obtained from these cell lines was capable of\nself-renewal, forming tumors in nonobese diabetic\nsevere combined immunodeficient mice, and were more\nresistant to chemotherapy.\nLim et al. [24] delineated a human mammary epithe-\nlial hierarchy by performing cell sorting on the basis of\ntwo cell surface markers (CD49f and EpCAM) and a\nseries of in vitro and in vivo experiments, including\ngene expression profiling of different subpopulations of\nthe normal breast. Using their microarray data, we\ndeveloped a genomic differentiation predictor that\nclassifies breast tumors on the basis of their differentia-\ntion status along a continuous MaSC \u00ae pL \u00ae mL\nepithelial hierarchy. We observed that the information\nprovided by the differentiation status adds prognostic\nvalue even when considered with intrinsic subtype and\nthe classical clinical variables. However, as developmen-\ntal studies further characterize the normal mammary\ndifferentiation hierarchy, approaches such as the one\nreported here can be improved. For example, much less\nis known about other cell types in the normal breast,\nsuch as the myoepithelial progenitors and other poten-\ntial intermediate progenitors, which may be responsible\nfor the development of other rare breast cancer subtypes\nsuch as medullary carcinomas. Finally, a similar genomic\napproach based on FACS data coming from other devel-\nopmental studies such as the ones by Lim et al. [24] or\nRaouf et al. [23] might prove useful in leukemia [55] or\nother solid tumors [56], where similar differentiation\nhierarchies have been identified, and thus this differen-\ntiation predictor algorithm may show benefit in cancers\nother than breast cancer.\nIntegration of the claudin-low tumor subtype together\nwith the known intrinsic subtypes delineates a differen-\ntiation hierarchy that resembles the normal epithelial\ndevelopment. These data point to different cells of ori-\ngin for each intrinsic subtype, or different stages of\ndevelopmental arrest for each subtype with a common\ncell type of transformation, or some combination of the\ntwo as different processes may be occurring for each dif-\nferent subtype. Indeed, Lim et al. [24] suggested that the\npotential cell of origin of the basal-like subtype in\nBRCA1 carriers might be the pL instead of the MaSC.\nAlternatively, as suggested by our in vitro analyses of\nthe SUM149PT cell line, BRCA1-mutated basal-like\ntumors might arise from transformation of a MaSC that\nis similar to claudin-low tumors or cell lines, but the\nclaudin-low tumors stay arrested in this undifferentiated\nstate, while MaSC or claudin-low cells in basal-like\ntumors are able to divide asymmetrically and give off\ndifferentiated progeny that then arrest at the pL state\n[57]. The therapeutic implication of the claudin-low\nsubtype will require additional retrospective and pro-\nspective evaluations, but what does appear clearer is\nthat the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer may be\nreflective of distinct stages of mammary epithelial cell\ndevelopment and that the claudin-low tumors (and cell\nlines) show the least differentiated phenotype.\nConclusions\nIt has become appreciated that breast cancer is not one\ndisease, but in fact represents multiple disease types,\neach of which may require a unique treatment.

Macrophages are tissue sentinels that maintain tis-\nsue integrity by eliminating/repairing damaged cells and matrices. In this M2-like mode,\nthey can also promote tumor growth. Conversely, M1-like macrophages are key effector\ncells for the elimination of pathogens, virally infected, and cancer cells. Macrophage dif-\nferentiation from monocytes occurs in the tissue in concomitance with the acquisition of\na functional phenotype that depends on microenvironmental signals, thereby accounting\nfor the many and apparently opposed macrophage functions. Many questions arise. When\nmonocytes differentiate into macrophages in a tissue (concomitantly adopting a speci\ufb01c\nfunctional program, M1 or M2), do they all die during the in\ufb02ammatory reaction, or do some\nof them survive? Do those that survive become quiescent tissue macrophages, able to\nreact as na\u00efve cells to a new challenge? Or, do monocyte-derived tissue macrophages con-\nserve a \u201cmemory\u201d of their past in\ufb02ammatory activation? This review will address some\nof these important questions under the general framework of the role of monocytes and\nmacrophages in the initiation, development, resolution, and chronicization of in\ufb02ammation.\nKeywords: monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, tissue-resident macrophages, functional phenotypes,\nin\ufb02ammation\nINTRODUCTION\nIn the healthy organism, the innate immune system provides the\n\ufb01rst line of defense against external or internal danger signals, by\ninitiating a protective in\ufb02ammatory response that develops during\ntime through different phases, from initiation and full in\ufb02amma-\ntion, to resolution and re-establishment of tissue integrity. The\n\ufb01rst phase of an in\ufb02ammatory response is aimed at destroying\npathogens, and is followed by a phase in which dead and dying\ncells, damaged extracellular matrix material, and cellular debris\nare removed, to end up with a recovery phase in which the tissue\nis repaired and restored to a healthy fully functional condition. In\nfact, if the defense against harmful threats is a priority for avoiding\ntissue damage, maintaining homeostasis (i.e., maintaining tissue\nmorphology and tissue function) is the ultimate goal of a tissue\nin multicellular organisms (1). In this perspective, in\ufb02ammation\npresumably evolved as an adaptive response to tissue malfunction\nor homeostatic imbalance (2). Thus,while the disease state is a dis-\nplacement from homeostasis, in\ufb02ammation is the tissue response\nfor restoring homeostasis. However, since the in\ufb02ammatory activ-\nities are potentially harmful to the host, these need to be tightly\ncontrolled to avoid excessive tissue damage (3).\nThe mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) plays major roles\nin development, scavenging, in\ufb02ammation, and anti-pathogen\ndefenses, both by the direct elimination of foreign agents and\nin organizing each different phase of the in\ufb02ammatory process\n(4). Under the term, MPS are grouped lineage-committed bone\nmarrow precursors, circulating monocytes, resident macrophages,\nand dendritic cells (DC) (5). The development, homeostatic\nmaintenance, proliferation, differentiation, and function of the\nMPS are regulated by the growth factors colony-stimulating fac-\ntor (CSF)-1 and interleukin (IL)-34, the second ligand for the\nCSF-1R (6, 7).\nThe issue of heterogeneity in the MPS still leads to a confusion\nand debate about DC as truly distinct cells from macrophages,\nwith separate lineage and functions (8). In fact, macrophages and\nmyeloid DC possibly represent alternative differentiation options\nof bone marrow progenitors and blood monocytes (9), with over-\nlapping functions and marker expression. Reviewing this issue\nis beyond the scope of this essay [we refer the reader to recent\nexcellent reviews on the topic; (9\u201311)], and will only focus on\nmonocytes and their relationship with macrophages.\nThe traditional view of the MPS suggests that recruited mono-\ncytes (that become macrophages in tissues) are key players during\nin\ufb02ammation and pathogen challenge, whereas tissue-resident\nmacrophages have important roles in development, tissue home-\nostasis, and the resolution of in\ufb02ammation. A basic concept of\nthe MPS is that blood monocytes are precursors that replace tis-\nsue macrophages within a single developmental lineage (4). This\ndogma needs now to be revised in the light of new evidence that\nmacrophages are endowed with self-renewal capacity and can pop-\nulate tissues before birth, deriving from early hematopoiesis in the\nyolk sac (12, 13). The discovery of new macrophage progenitors\nof embryonic origin forces us to reassess de\ufb01nitions, functions,\nand cell\u2013cell relationships within the MPS. We can synthesize it in\nthree key new questions:\n1.

What is the relationship between monocytes and macrophages\nand which are their mutual roles in different phases of\nin\ufb02ammatory reactions?\nAnother new perspective arises from the description of\nmacrophage polarization, i.e., the ability of macrophages to\nacquire different functional phenotypes, enabling them to steer\nadaptive immunity in different directions. This highlights the\ncentral role of macrophages in immune defense, overturning\nthe long-held notion that macrophages need to be activated by\nT-cells (14).\nThis review will summarize what has been so far investigated\nand established on monocyte/macrophage biology, highlighting\nwhat remains outstanding, and which questions are still unan-\nswered. We will consider key studies that have been carried out in\nmice, with reference to the human situation when data are avail-\nable. We will review the various aspects (monocyte recruitment,\nmonocyte functions, macrophage polarization) before (homeo-\nstatic conditions), during (in\ufb02ammatory reaction), and after a\ndamaging event (resolution/repair).\nMONOCYTES\nMONOCYTE DEVELOPMENT AND HETEROGENEITY\nMonocytes are a group of cells circulating in the blood, bone\nmarrow, and spleen, and constituting ~10% of the total leuko-\ncytes in human beings and only 2\u20134% in mice. They have typi-\ncal morphological features, such as irregular cell shape, oval- or\nkidney-shaped nucleus, cytoplasmic vesicles, and high cytoplasm-\nto-nucleus ratio. Monocytes can remain in the circulation for up\nto 1\u20132 days, after which time, if they have not been recruited into\na tissue for facing a danger, they die and are removed. Mono-\ncytes originate in the bone marrow from hematopoietic stem cells\n(HSCs) and develop through a series of sequential differentia-\ntion stages: the common myeloid progenitor (CMP) (15), the\ngranulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) (15), the common\nmacrophage and DC precursor (MDP) (16), and \ufb01nally the com-\nmitted monocyte progenitor (cMoP), a recently identi\ufb01ed bone\nmarrow precursor that differs from MDP as it lacks CD135 expres-\nsion (17). MDP gives rise also to common DC progenitors (CDP),\nwhose differentiation potential is restricted to the DC lineage\n(18). Monocytes have been considered as the systemic reservoir\nof myeloid precursors for renewal of tissue macrophages and DC.\nHowever, many DC and macrophage subpopulations [for exam-\nple, lymphoid organ DC, plasmacytoid DC, skin Langerhans cells\n(LC), and brain microglia] originate from the MDP independent\nof monocytes (11, 18), and in some cases, they can even develop\ndirectly from the bone marrow (19).\nHomeostatic control of monocyte/macrophage development is\nmostly in\ufb02uenced by CSF-1 (also known as M-CSF), produced by\nstromalcellswithinthebloodandintissues(20).Maturemononu-\nclear phagocytes in turn express CSF-1 receptors (CSF-1R) and\nremove circulating CSF-1, allowing a feedback loop responsi-\nble for monocyte proliferation decrease (21, 22). Recently, the\ncytokine IL-34 has been identi\ufb01ed as able to bind and signal\nthrough the CSF-1R (6, 23). Unlike broadly expressed CSF-1,\nIL-34 expression is restricted to the epidermis and central ner-\nvous system (24), where it supports the steady-state proliferation\nof macrophages (LC and microglia, respectively). Granulocyte-\nmacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is another fac-\ntor involved in the development of mononuclear phagocytes but\nonly during the in\ufb02ammatory state and not under homeostatic\nconditions (25, 26).\nAbundant experimental evidence indicates that recruited\nmonocytes are innate effectors of the in\ufb02ammatory response to\nmicrobes, and they kill pathogens via phagocytosis, production\nof reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), myeloperox-\nidase, and in\ufb02ammatory cytokines (27). In some circumstances,\nmonocytes can trigger and polarize T-cell responses (27, 28) and\nmay also contribute to angiogenesis and atherogenesis (29).\nHuman peripheral blood monocytes are not a homogeneous\npopulation. Monocyte heterogeneity was \ufb01rst reported with\nthe identi\ufb01cation of a minor population of CD16 (Fc\u03b3RIII)-\nexpressing cells within circulating human monocytes (30). In\nrecent years, investigators have identi\ufb01ed three functional sub-\nsets of human monocytes, the characterization of which is still\nin its infancy. Likewise, it is still unclear which are the speci\ufb01c\nroles that they exert in homeostasis and in\ufb02ammation in vivo,\nin comparison with those of the previously described classically\nand alternatively activated macrophages (see below). The new\nnomenclature that groups monocytes into three subsets, based\non the expression of the surface markers CD14 and CD16, has\nrecently been approved by the Nomenclature Committee of the\nInternational Union of Immunologic Societies (31). Based on\nthis nomenclature, the major population of human monocytes\n(90%) with high CD14 but no CD16 expression (CD14++CD16\u2212\nor CD14+CD16\u2212) are termed classical monocytes, whereas the\nminor population of human monocytes (10%) is further sub-\ndivided into the intermediate subset, with low CD16 and high\nCD14 (CD14++CD16+ or CD14+CD16+), and the non-classical\nsubset, with high CD16 but with relatively lower CD14 expression\n(CD14+CD16++ or CD14dimCD16+) (31). In this review,we refer\nonly to the main difference, terming classical monocytes simply as\nCD14+, and non-classical as CD16+.\nOver the recent years, an increasing amount of knowledge\nhas been gained in the \ufb01eld of monocyte subpopulations. Many\nauthors demonstrated that the three subsets express different tran-\nscriptomes (32\u201338), although discrepancies between studies were\nevident. These discrepancies may be due to differences in cell isola-\ntionmethodologyandinthepurityof thecellpopulationsisolated,\nand the microarray methodologies, which use different amounts\nof total RNA for the hybridization, different probes to identify\nthe genes, and even distinct solid supports for the probes (39).\nHowever, there is stronger agreement for the proximity of rela-\ntionship between the intermediate and non-classical monocyte\nsubsets, while the classical subset is the most distant subset (36).\nThe close relationship between intermediate and non-classical\nmonocytes suggests a direct developmental relationship between\nthem, although this has yet to be formally proven. Also, it needs to\nbe clari\ufb01ed how the characteristics previously ascribed to CD16+\nmonocytes are distributed between intermediate and non-classical\nsubsets (36).

They might have different roles during the home-\nostasis, immune defense/in\ufb02ammation, and tissue repair, in terms\nof their capacity to become activated and secrete in\ufb02ammatory\ncytokines in response to different stimuli, antigen processing and\npresentation, pro-angiogenic and patrolling behavior. The phe-\nnotypic and functional differences between the monocyte sub-\nsets were recently discussed in an exhaustive review (41). The\nauthors of this review report a complete and referenced list\nof studies on bacterial and viral infections, autoimmune dis-\neases, and in\ufb02ammatory conditions, in which an expansion of\nCD16+ cells in respect to other subsets has been observed. In\ngeneral terms, both human classical and intermediate monocytes\nhave in\ufb02ammatory properties reminiscent of the murine Ly6C+\nmonocytes (also termed \u201cin\ufb02ammatory\u201d monocytes) (42), while\nnon-classical monocytes display patrolling properties similar to\nthose of murine Ly6C\u2212monocytes (also termed \u201calternative\u201d or\n\u201cpatrolling\u201d monocytes) (43). Both human and mouse in\ufb02am-\nmatory monocytes express high levels of the chemokine receptor\nCCR2 and low levels of the chemokine receptor CX3CR1, whereas\npatrolling monocytes show a reverse pattern. Accordingly, in\ufb02am-\nmatory monocytes respond to the chemokine CCL2 that mediates\nLy6C+/CD14+ monocyte recruitment to in\ufb02ammatory sites (44),\nwhile patrolling monocytes respond to CX3C-chemokine ligand\n1 [CX3CL1, the human fractalkine and mouse neurotactin; (45)],\na chemokine present both as soluble protein and as membrane-\nbound chemokine form that is expressed on endothelial cells and\nin tissues. Overall, it is clear that the subsets between human being\nand mouse are similar but not identical (42, 46). Table 1 summa-\nrizes the main features of monocytes in human beings and mice.\nOf note, there is a clear difference in the proportion of the two\nmonocyte subsets,as Ly6C\u2212cells represent about half of the circu-\nlating monocytes in mice, whereas CD16+ monocytes account for\nless than 15% in human beings (30). However, Ziegler-Heitbrock\nhypothesized that the higher proportion of the Ly6C\u2212in mouse\nblood could be due to stressful blood drawing (cardiac puncture\nunder terminal anesthesia) that mobilizes these monocytes from\nthe marginal pool (46). This hypothesis still needs experimental\nproof.\nTo date,a relevant question that is still open concerns the origin\nof the various monocyte subpopulations. It should be kept in mind\nthat the majority of current knowledge derives from mouse stud-\nies. It is unknown if the monocyte subpopulations are end stages of\ndifferent differentiation paths of a common precursor, or whether\nthey represent subsequent maturation stages in a common path of\ndifferentiation, where the intermediate subset could be a pheno-\ntypical and/or developmental intermediate between the classical\nand non-classical subsets. The latter hypothesis seems to be the\nmost reliable. While initial studies suggested that Ly6C+ cells were\nrecruited under in\ufb02ammatory conditions and did not serve as pre-\ncursors to Ly6C\u2212cells [which in turn were originally considered\nthe immediate precursors of resident macrophages; (43)], recent\nevidence suggests that, in steady state, Ly6C+ monocytes are pre-\ncursors of Ly6C\u2212monocytes (48, 49), as shown in experiments in\nwhich grafted Ly6C+ monocytes spontaneously differentiated into\nLy6C\u2212inthebloodof recipientmice(48).Thisconversioncanalso\noccur in the bone marrow, where Ly6C+ monocytes apparently\nreturn in the absence of in\ufb02ammation (47\u201349). More recently, it\nhas been suggested that CSF-1R signaling was required for the\nmaturation of monocytes from Ly6C+ to Ly6C\u2212, as blockade of\nthis receptor leads to decrease in the number of Ly6C\u2212cells,short-\nens their lifespan (48), and concomitantly increases the number\nof Ly6C+ monocytes (50).\nIt has also been observed that development of the Ly6C\u2212popu-\nlation depends on the transcription factor NR4A1 (Nurr77) (51).\nNR4A1 deletion alters the number of Ly6C\u2212monocytes in the\nTable 1 | Human and murine monocyte subsets.\nSpecies\nSubseta\n% In WB\n% In blood\nmonocytes\nHalf-life\nMarkers\nChemokine\nreceptors\nOther surface\nmarkers\nMain functions\nHuman\nbeing\nClassical\n~10%\n85%\n1\u20132 days\nCD14++CD16\u2212\nCCR2+CX3CR1\u2212\nCD62L+, CD64\u2212, MHC\nclass II+, CD163+\nPhagocytosis,\nin\ufb02ammatory effectors\nIntermediate\n5%\n\u2013\nCD14++CD16+\nCCR2\u2212CX3CR1+\nCD62L+, CD64\u2212, MHC\nclass II++, CD163+\nIn\ufb02ammatory effectors\nNon-classical\n10%\n\u2013\nCD14+CD16++\nCCR2\u2212CX3CR1+\nCD62L\u2212, CD64+, MHC\nclass II++, CD163\u2212\nPatrolling, antiviral role\nMouse\nLy6Clow\n4%\n~60%\n18\u201320 h\nCD11b+CD115+\nLy6C+\nCCR2+CX3CR1\u2212\nF4/80+, CD62L\u2212, MHC\nclass IIb, CD43+\nPhagocytosis,\nIn\ufb02ammatory effectors\nLy6Chigh\n~40%\n5\u20137 days\nCD11b+CD115+\nLy6C\u2212\nCCR2\u2212CX3CR1+\nF4/80+, CD62L+, MHC\nclass IIb, CD43\u2212\nPatrolling, tissue repair\naWork by Sunderk\u00f6tter et al.

This suggests that\neither Ly6C\u2212monocytes can develop from MDP within the bone\nmarrow, or that Ly6C\u2212monocytes are a functional end stage. In\nthis regard,given that Ly6C\u2212monocytes exhibit a long steady-state\nhalf-life of 5\u20137 days [which in the absence of their renewal from\nLy6C+ monocytes can extend to 2 weeks; (48)] compared to ~8 h\nfor Ly6C+cells, Ly6C\u2212monocytes might be considered as termi-\nnally differentiated blood-resident macrophages or \u201cvasculature\nmacrophages,\u201d rather than bona \ufb01de monocytes (48). Indeed, the\nprimary function of these cells seems to be that of patrolling the\nvascular endothelium and monitoring its integrity (45, 51). Con-\nversely,andinparallelwithhumanCD14+ cells,Ly6C+ monocytes\nbecause of their short half-life are unlikely to have other functions,\nand thus are more likely to be the direct precursors of the tis-\nsue macrophages/peripheral mononuclear phagocytes described\nin the original MPS model.\nFUNCTION OF MONOCYTE SUBSETS DURING HOMEOSTASIS\n(CLASSICAL VS. ANTIGEN-PRESENTING TISSUE MONOCYTES VS.\nPATROLLING MONOCYTES)\nThe original concept of MPS implicated that classical mono-\ncytes are recruited in the tissue to become tissue-resident\nmacrophages in homeostatic conditions, and in\ufb02ammatory acti-\nvated macrophages during an infection (27, 54). We will examine\nmore in detail the role of recruited cells during the in\ufb02amma-\ntory response later, while here we will focus on the recruitment of\nmonocytes in homeostasis and their contribution to maintaining\nthe pool of tissue macrophages. In order to avoid misunderstand-\nings, it is important to agree on the de\ufb01nition of monocyte. In\nour view, bona \ufb01de monocytes are restricted to the blood com-\npartment, and to the bone marrow and spleen (55), where they\nwait to be released in the blood. For obvious reasons, in both\nthese compartments, monocytes should not initiate any in\ufb02am-\nmatory reaction, but they must be ready to be recruited into\nthe blood \ufb01rst and subsequently to all organs and tissues. A\nphenomenon was recently reported, termed \u201canticipatory in\ufb02am-\nmation,\u201d whereby Ly6C+ classical monocytes are released from\nthe bone marrow in diurnal rhythmic waves under the control\nof circadian gene Bmal1 (or Arntl) (56) to provide an adequate\ninnate response to environmental challenges that are expected\nto occur with a evolutionarily predicted frequency. Despite new\nevidence supports the view that Ly6C+ classical monocytes are\nnot precursors of resident macrophages in all tissues and dur-\ning certain types of in\ufb02ammation (see below), it is clear that\ncirculating monocytes contribute to the repopulation of tissue-\nresident macrophages under homeostatic conditions in tissues\nlike the lamina propria of the small intestine and healthy skin.\nStudies based on functional and lineage tracing and adoptive\ntransfer have revealed that Ly6C+ monocytes are precursors of\nintestinal macrophages that have a short half-life of only 3 weeks\n(57\u201359). Conversely, in the dermis are present both resident der-\nmal macrophages and monocyte-derived macrophages (60, 61). A\nrecent work suggests that the number of macrophages is partially\nreplenished by monocytes also in the heart (62) and in the lung\n(63). It is unknown why some tissue macrophages are constantly\nmaintained by circulating monocytes, whereas other populations\nare independent on circulating monocytes (see below). The notion\nthat monocyte-derived macrophages derive from Ly6C+ cells sug-\ngests that the repopulation/maintenance of resident macrophages\nin steady-state conditions follows the same mechanism as that\noccurring during in\ufb02ammation.\nThe function of Ly6C+ monocytes in circulation remains\npoorly de\ufb01ned. In the attempt to identify an effective role of\nmonocytes in the blood in homeostatic conditions (besides being\nprecursor cells), a recent work has suggested a distinct surveil-\nlance phenotype for Ly6C+ monocytes (64). These monocytes\ncan enter non-lymphoid organs without obligatory differentiation\ninto macrophages or DC. The authors propose that these mono-\ncytes can upregulate MHC class II expression and subsequently\nrecirculate to lymph nodes, where they are able to present antigens\nto T-cells. Considering that these cells retain a monocyte-like gene\nexpression pro\ufb01le,the authors term them\u201ctissue monocytes\u201d(64).\nThis study contributes to revising the role of circulating mono-\ncytes, suggesting that they are not only precursors of macrophages\nbut also effector cells.\nRegarding the role of the Ly6C\u2212subset in the blood in steady-\nstate conditions, intravital microscopy studies have established\nthat these cells display a \u201cpatrolling\u201d phenotype, being able to\ncrawl on the luminal surface of the vascular endothelium (45,\n51). This patrolling behavior, along with the ability to phagocy-\ntose endothelial-associated particles, suggests that a primary role\nof these monocytes is sensing and scanning the endothelial surface\nfor damage and/or the presence of pathogens (51). The patrolling\nmonocytes mainly respond via Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) to local\ndanger signals (while they are poorly responsive to bacterial prod-\nuctssuchasLPS)byproducingin\ufb02ammatorymediators(51).They\nare able to induce the intravascular recruitment of neutrophils,\nwhich trigger endothelial necrosis, and subsequently they clear the\nresulting debris (51). A similar patrolling feature and TLR7/TLR8-\ndependent reactivity were also detected in human CD14+CD16++\nmonocytes (35).\nConsistent with their functional role of surveillance of the\nendothelium integrity and with the fact that they are terminally\ndifferentiated cells, we agree with the view that Ly6C\u2212/CD16+\ncan be considered as the tissue-resident macrophages of the blood.\nRegarding their ability to produce in\ufb02ammatory factors,we specu-\nlate that the patrolling monocytes have a higher activation thresh-\nold than Ly6C+ monocytes; therefore, they should be able to\nproduce an amount of in\ufb02ammatory cytokines and chemokines\nsuf\ufb01cient for coordinating the repair of a damaged endothelium,\nbut not enough to initiate a strong in\ufb02ammatory reaction.\nA summary of the roles of monocyte subsets in steady state vs.\nin\ufb02ammatory conditions is reported in Table 2.\nMACROPHAGES\nTISSUE-RESIDENT MACROPHAGE DEVELOPMENT IN STEADY STATE:\nEMBRYONIC ORIGIN VS.

On\nthe other hand, the functions of macrophages are the same in\nall tissues.

In addition to\na wealth of old data (77, 78), two new pieces of evidence have\nfurther weakened the view that monocytes are the precursors\nof tissue macrophages in steady-state conditions: (1) the \ufb01nd-\ning of the macrophage origin from embryonic progenitors that\nseed developing tissues before birth and give rise to fetal tissue\nmacrophages (79) and (2) the self-maintaining ability of tissue-\nresident macrophages through local proliferation in adulthood\n(13). The latter \ufb01nding will be discussed hereafter.\nTwo main phases of embryonic hematopoiesis have been\ndescribed in the mouse: primitive hematopoiesis and de\ufb01nitive\nhematopoiesis. The former takes place in the ectoderm of the\nyolk sac and gives rise to macrophages without going through\na monocytic progenitor. The latter takes place in the fetal liver,\nwhich is initially seeded by hematopoietic progenitors from the\nyolk sac and subsequently by HSCs from endothelium of the\naorta-gonads-mesonephros (80, 81). The fetal liver subsequently\nbecomes the source of de\ufb01nitive hematopoiesis that generates cir-\nculating monocytes during embryogenesis. Spleen and bone mar-\nrow are also colonized via the circulatory system by hematopoietic\nprogenitors that will ultimately differentiate there. After birth,\nupon bone formation, hematopoiesis passes from the fetal liver\nto the bone marrow. The de\ufb01nitive bone marrow hematopoiesis is\nthe source of both Ly6C+ and Ly6C\u2212circulating monocytes, from\nwhich resident tissue macrophages were thought to derive (10).\nThe human embryonic hematopoietic system is organized\nroughly in the same way as in the mouse (82), and early studies\npropose that macrophages could arise in the embryo independent\nof bone marrow progenitors in human beings [for more extensive\nreading, see Ref. (83, 84)]. In summary, macrophages in fetal and\nadult tissues derive from at least three sources: yolk sac (giving rise\nto some tissue-resident yolk sac-derived macrophages), fetal liver\nBox 1 A hint on osteoclasts.\nOsteoclasts are multinuclear giant cells with a hematopoietic origin, commonly known as bone macrophages.They function in bone resorp-\ntion and are involved in a normal skeletal development, growth, and modeling, for the maintenance of its integrity throughout life, and for\nremodeling through calcium metabolism (65). Moreover, osteoclasts are able to interact with the hematopoietic system and the adaptive\nimmune system (66). Excessive bone loss mediated by osteoclasts plays a major role in certain pathologic conditions, such as rheumatoid\narthritis (RA) and osteoporosis (67, 68). On the other hand, insuf\ufb01cient bone resorption due to the lack of functional osteoclasts (as in CSF-1R\nknock-out mice) leads to excessive bone apposition and osteopetrosis (69).\nOsteoclasts really seem a class of macrophages on their own.They are generated from mononuclear phagocyte lineage progenitors in the\nbone marrow, and their differentiation from an osteoclast precursor (PreOC) depends on CSF-1 and the engagement of receptor activator\nof nuclear factor-\u03baB (RANK) and its ligand (RANKL), a speci\ufb01c osteoclast differentiation factor (70). Recently, it has been shown that also\nIL-34 is involved in the osteoclast development (71).\nOsteoclasts can differentiate in vitro from a cell population named monocyte-derived multipotential cells (MOMCs), which seem to originate\nfrom circulating CD14+ monocytes (72). In vitro induction of MOMCs from circulating CD14+ monocytes apparently requires their binding\nto \ufb01bronectin, and exposure to soluble factor(s) derived from peripheral blood CD14dim monocytes (72).\nThus, culture of unfractionated peripheral blood monocytes with M-CSF and RANKL is suf\ufb01cient to induce their differentiation into\nosteoclasts, and it has been assumed that osteoclast precursors are monocytes, although this has not been shown in vivo.\nThe question arises as to why osteoclasts, unlike other macrophages, have their own lineage of commitment and differentiation. Possibly,\nthe reason may lie in the fact that they are phylogenically closely linked to the presence of bone, a tissue that develops late as com-\npared to other organs and tissues during embryonic/fetal development, as in fact vertebrates are the most recent phylogenic step in the\nevolution (73).\nwww.frontiersin.org\nOctober 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 514 | 5\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nItaliani and Boraschi\nMonocyte to macrophage differentiation\n(giving rise to fetal liver-derived macrophages), and bone marrow\n(giving rise to tissue-resident bone marrow-derived macrophages\nand in\ufb02ammatory bone marrow-derived macrophages, see below)\n(Figure 1). The primitive yolk sac-derived macrophages have\ntwo distinct characteristics: (1) their pattern of differentiation\ndoes not go through a monocytic intermediate state but they\ndirectly become mature macrophages in fetal tissues (85) and\n(2) unlike macrophages derived from de\ufb01nitive c-Myb-dependent\nhematopoiesis, they are independent of the transcriptional factor\nc-Myb during development, while depending on the transcrip-\ntional factor PU.1 (12).\nBased on different experimental approaches, from lineage trac-\ning (12, 48) to experiments carried out in parabiotic mice (64,\n86), it is evident that monocytes do not contribute or con-\ntribute only minimally to the maintenance of peripheral tissue-\nresident macrophages in steady-state conditions in many adult\ntissues. Fate-mapping experiments have shown that the adult\nmicroglial cell population is exclusively derived from yolk sac\nprogenitors (87, 88), whereas for LC in adult skin it was clearly\ndemonstrated a mixed origin, from the yolk sac and from the\nfetal liver (12, 89). Moreover, using Myb-de\ufb01cient mice that\nlack development of HSCs, followed by transplantation with\ngenetically dissimilar bone marrow together with fate mapping,\nit has been observed that yolk sac macrophages can generate\nmacrophages with a characteristically high expression of the F4/80\nmarker (F4/80 bright macrophages) in brain (microglia), skin\n(LC), liver (Kupffer cells), pancreas, and spleen (12). In kid-\nney and lung, tissue-resident macrophages have a double origin,\nencompassing F4/80high macrophages, derived from yolk sac, and\nF4/80low macrophages, which have a hematopoietic origin and are\ncontinuously replaced by bone marrow-derived progenitors (12).\nMoreover,F4/80high shares a common gene signature with yolk sac\nmacrophages, unlike F4/80low cells, as shown by global transcrip-\ntional analysis (12). Also, for splenic red pulp macrophages, alve-\nolar, and peritoneal macrophages, an embryonic origin has been\ncon\ufb01rmed, rather than a monocyte origin (48). All these experi-\nmentsshowthatearlyembryonicprogenitor-derivedmacrophages\ncan persist in tissues to adulthood. As mentioned previously, an\nexception is the gut, which contains a large population of resi-\ndent macrophages that are all blood monocyte-derived cells, in\nsteady-state conditions (57). How the mutual contribution of yolk\nsac-derived macrophages and fetal liver-derived monocytes is reg-\nulated in each tissue is unknown, and likewise it is not known\nhow these two distinct populations of macrophages are func-\ntionally and ontogenically related. Regarding how much yolk sac\nprogenitors contribute to originating adult tissue macrophages vs.\nfetal liver hematopoiesis,there are different opinions. One hypoth-\nesis is that fetal liver-derived monocytes proliferate and differen-\ntiate into adult tissue macrophages markedly diluting the popula-\ntion of yolk sac-derived macrophages (e.g.,in lung and heart). This\nhypothesis stems from the observation that generation of yolk sac-\nderived macrophages does not go through a monocytic intermedi-\nate, therefore being in contrast with normal adult hematopoiesis,\nwhile a fetal liver origin for tissue macrophages would be reminis-\ncent of the adult scenario in in\ufb02ammation (90). Conversely,others\nbelieve that all tissue macrophages derive from yolk sac during the\nembryonic development, and circulating monocytes do not seed\nthe majority of the adult tissues in mice (except kidney and lung)\n(12, 91) (Figure 2). This concept is strengthened by \ufb01ndings in\nhuman beings, where a complete loss of CD16+ monocytes seems\nto be of little consequence (92), and many tissue macrophage pop-\nulationsappeartobeintactinpatientswithmonocytopeniacaused\nFIGURE 1 | Origin of tissue-resident macrophages in the mouse. In adult\ntissues, macrophages derive from three sources. The \ufb01rst is the yolk sac in\nthe embryo, where primitive hematopoiesis occurs giving rise to progenitors\nthat seed tissues with F4/80high macrophages. Later during fetal development,\nhematopoiesis shifts from the yolk sac to the fetal liver (that seems to\ncontribute to the LC pool in the skin, possibly through a yolk sac-derived\nprogenitor). It is unknown whether other resident macrophages in other\ntissues may also derive from fetal liver hematopoiesis. The third source is the\nbone marrow, where de\ufb01nitive hematopoiesis occurs in the fetus and in the\nadult, giving rise to monocytes and to monocyte-derived F4/80low\nmacrophages. Expression of murine F4/80 (the human EMR1) is an\ninsuf\ufb01cient marker to discriminate between monocyte-derived macrophages\nand tissue-resident macrophages.

In conclusion,to which\nextent different populations of yolk sac-derived macrophages may\nbe later replaced by fetal liver-derived macrophages or monocytes,\nand how yolk sac-derived tissue-resident macrophages can prolif-\nerate locally through life to maintain their own pool independently\nof adult monocyte input, these issues remain a matter of debate\n(90, 91, 95). Thus, three main issues arise from all these \ufb01ndings:\n1. The origin of adult macrophages in steady-state conditions can\nvary considerably between tissues.\n2. The exact role of the patrolling Ly6C\u2212monocytes remains\nunclear, while Ly6C+ monocytes are recruited predominantly\nto sites of infection or injury, or to the organs and tissues that\nhave continuous cyclic recruitment of macrophages (such as\nthe uterus), or that are exposed to microbiota (such as the gut\nand the skin).\n3. Due to some limits and weaknesses of the published studies\n(whole blood irradiation or other myelo-ablative treatments,\nparabiotic mice, engrafted bone marrow or monocytes, adop-\ntive transfer of radiolabeled cells,Cre-loxP-based fate mapping,\nCCR2 or CSF-1 inactivation, etc.) (9, 90), none of such studies\nprovides conclusive evidence against a role for monocytes in\ntissue macrophage homeostasis. Thus, more ef\ufb01cient and spe-\nci\ufb01cfate-mappingmodelsof yolksac-derivedmacrophagesand\nfetal liver-derived monocytes are needed, along with further\ninvestigation, to determine which tissue macrophage popula-\ntions are constantly replenished by circulating monocytes and\nwhich are not.\nSELF-RENEWAL/PROLIFERATION CAPACITY OF TISSUE-RESIDENT\nMACROPHAGES IN HOMEOSTASIS\nGiven that it is currently not possible to discriminate the\ntwo populations of tissue macrophages (yolk sac-derived and\nmonocyte-derived) during homeostasis,we will report their ability\nto proliferate without considering them as distinct subpopula-\ntions. In any case, we will bear in mind the notion that the tissue\nmacrophages can maintain their number in the absence of mono-\ncyte precursors both in steady-state conditions (12, 48, 64, 86) as\nwell as in genetically or experimentally monocytopenic situations\n(94, 95).\nIt is important to clarify the difference between self-renewal\nand proliferative capacity. As stated by Sieweke and Allen (13), in\nimmunology, self-renewal is understood as a replacement of a cer-\ntain cell population, while in stem cell research as the capacity to\ngenerate with a cell division a daughter cell showing the same iden-\ntity as the parental cell. Local proliferation of tissue macrophages\ncan be considered as self-renewal in both senses [see Ref. (12,\n13)], since macrophages can proliferate without change of their\ndifferentiated phenotype (96). Having said that, recent evidence\ndemonstratedthatmacrophageswithintheadulttissuesself-renew\nvia proliferation in homeostatic conditions rather than through an\nin\ufb02ux of progenitors. This has been shown for LC, which are able\nto proliferate (97) both in human beings (98) and in mice (99),\nfor brain microglia (19), resident peritoneal macrophages (100),\nand alveolar macrophages (101). The self-renewal process is regu-\nlated by growth factors and cytokines such as CSF-1 and GM-CSF\n(Box 2).\nResident macrophages can proliferate at low levels in steady-\nstate conditions, but proliferation rates strongly increase after\nmacrophage depletion (86) or under in\ufb02ammatory challenge (13).\nRegarding their proliferative ability, Ginhoux and Jung (90) raise\nthe interesting question as to \u201cwhether all macrophages within\na tissue possess equal self-renewal potential, or whether there\nare macrophage subpopulations that differ in their capacity of\nsurvival and proliferation, which would imply the existence of\nmacrophages subpopulations with stem cell-like features.\u201d The\nquestionarisesfromobservationsthatphysiologicalorexperimen-\ntal depletion of LC leads to a clonal expansion of LC by adjacent\nproliferative cell clusters with stem cell-like features (120), and\nthat among lung macrophages, different cells can proliferate to\nmaintain the population (87). To solve this issue, there is evi-\ndence that a macrophage that had previously divided has the same\nprobability of entering the cell cycle as a cell that had not, sug-\ngesting the same proliferative ability for all macrophages (87).\nThis is consistent with the observation that macrophages geneti-\ncally modi\ufb01ed to have an inde\ufb01nite self-renewal potential can be\nef\ufb01ciently cloned (96).\nDuring in\ufb02ammation, things are quite different, espe-\ncially because the tissue is enriched with monocyte-derived\nmacrophages. We will discuss later the replenishment of tissue\nmacrophages by monocyte-derived macrophages and their ability\nto proliferate.\nTISSUE MACROPHAGE FUNCTIONS\nTable 3 summarizes the functions of resident macrophages in\nthe main body tissues. These functions, mirroring different phe-\nnotypes (74, 143), are speci\ufb01c because depending on different\ntissue microenvironments.

Macrophages and circulating monocytes express the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) (42, 43), and mouse de\ufb01cient in CSF-1R\n(osteopetropic mice, op/op) have a decreased number of monocytes in the bone marrow and in circulation, in addition to a decrease in\nosteoclasts (69, 104). Experimentally blocking CSF-1R with antibodies leads to a reduction in Ly6C\u2212monocytes (69) and to an associated\nincrease in Ly6C+ monocytes, suggesting the involvement of CSF-1 in the maturation of monocytes from Ly6C+ to Ly6C\u2212(48, 104). CSF-1 is\nconstitutively produced by mesenchymal cells (105) and is detectable in circulation in resting conditions (20). Under homeostatic conditions\n(106), CSF-1 promotes monocyte development and macrophage proliferation (107), which is controlled in a negative feedback loop. In fact,\nmature mononuclear phagocytes express high level of CSF-1R and are responsible for the clearance of CSF-1. The decreased CSF-1 levels\nlead to a decrease in mononuclear cell proliferation, thereby maintaining the cell number to normal levels both systemically and locally [(21,\n22); a model of CSF-1-dependent local homeostasis of macrophage density has been described by Jenkins and Hume (9)]. Thus, elevated\nproduction of CSF-1 can drive both an increased proliferation of resident macrophages and an increased recruitment of monocytes (103, 108)\nvia macrophage production of CCL2 (109). CSF-1 de\ufb01ciency in mice affects distinct tissues by different degrees, ranging from marked cell\nloss in the gut, kidney, peritoneal cavity, and in circulation, as compared to liver (86). CSF-1 is also involved in the proliferation of splenic red\npulp macrophages and bone marrow macrophages (110). GM-CSF is also critical for macrophage homeostasis and proliferation, especially\nin the lung (111) and in the peritoneal cavity in vivo (112), but it is less important in hematopoiesis, and, therefore, for monocyte development\n(113). GM-CSF can support monocyte expansion and differentiation in vitro (25, 114), and it seems to be mainly involved in induction of\nhematopoiesis during in\ufb02ammation rather than in homeostasis (115, 116). CSF-1 and GM-CSF are also involved in monocyte/macrophage\nfunctional differentiation programs: CSF-1 stimulation leads to a homeostatic or anti-in\ufb02ammatory M2-like phenotype (25, 117, 118), whereas\nGM-CSF leads to an M1-like in\ufb02ammatory phenotype (25, 117\u2013119).Thus, CSF-1 stimulation represents a default homeostatic/M2 pathway\nof monocyte development (119). In summary, CSF-1 is mainly involved in self-renewal of tissue macrophages, consistent with its role in\nM2 polarization, while GM-CSF is involved in proliferation of monocyte-derived in\ufb02ammatory macrophages, consistent with its role in M1\npolarization.\nTable 3 | Macrophage functions and the pathological consequences of their anomalous activation in the main tissues.\nMacrophages (M\u03a6)\nTissue\nFunctions\nPathology\nMicroglia\nBrain\nBrian development (121), immune surveillance,\nsynaptic remodeling (122)\nNeurodegeneration (123)\nOsteoclasts\nBone\nBone modeling and remodeling, bone resorption\n(124), support to hematopoiesis (125)\nOsteoporosis, osteopetrosis, arthritis (126)\nHeart M\u03a6\nHeart and vasculature\nSurveillance\nAtherosclerosis (127)\nKupffer cells\nLiver\nToxin removal, lipid metabolism, iron recycling,\nerythrocyte clearance, clearance of microbes, and\ncell debris from blood (128, 129)\nFibrosis (130), impaired erythrocyte\nclearance (131)\nAlveolar M\u03a6\nLung\nSurfactant clearance, surveillance for inhaled\npathogens (132)\nAlveolar proteinosis (133)\nAdipose tissue-associated\nM\u03a6\nAdipose tissue\nMetabolism, adipogenesis, adaptive\nthermogenesis (134)\nObesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, loss\nof adaptive thermogenesis (131)\nBone marrow M\u03a6\nBone marrow\nReservoir of monocytes, waste disposal (131)\nDisruption of hematopoiesis (131)\nIntestinal M\u03a6\nGut\nTolerance to microbiota, defense against pathogens,\nintestinal homeostasis (135)\nIn\ufb02ammatory bowel disease (136)\nLangerhans cells\nSkin\nImmune surveillance (137)\nInsuf\ufb01cient healing, \ufb01brosis (138)\nMarginal zone M\u03a6, red\npulp M\u03a6\nSpleen\nErythrocyte clearance, iron processing, capture of\nmicrobes from blood (139)\nImpaired iron recycling and erythrocyte\nclearance (140)\nIn\ufb02ammatory M\u03a6a\nAll tissues\nDefense against pathogens, protection against\ndangerous stimuli (141)\nChronic in\ufb02ammation, tissue damage,\nautoimmunity (91)\nHealing M\u03a6b\nAll tissues\nBranched morphology, angiogenesis (142)\nCancer, \ufb01brosis, epithelial hyperplasia (91)\naAlso known as in\ufb02ammatory macrophages or M1 macrophages.\nbAlso known as deactivated or M2 macrophages.\nFrontiers in Immunology | In\ufb02ammation\nOctober 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 514 | 8\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nItaliani and Boraschi\nMonocyte to macrophage differentiation\nbone marrow (10), phenotypes that are necessary for the tissue-\nspeci\ufb01c needs of defending, maintaining, and regaining home-\nostasis (144). These homeostatic functions may be altered by\nchronic insults, which may lead to an anomalous prolonga-\ntion/ampli\ufb01cationof themacrophageattempttoregainhomeosta-\nsis and to a consequent causal association between macrophages\nand diseases (Table 3). In pathological conditions, the distinction\nbetween tissue-resident macrophages and recruited in\ufb02amma-\ntory macrophages has not yet been possible. For an in-depth\nanalysis of these issues, the reader can refer to recent exhaustive\nreviews (99, 144, 145). Apart from tissue-speci\ufb01c functions, tissue\nmacrophages share a series of common functions encompass-\ning clearance of cell debris, immune surveillance, wound healing,\ndefense against pathogens, and the initiation and resolution of\nin\ufb02ammation. In this review, we will only focus on the role of\nmacrophages in in\ufb02ammatory responses, considering their capac-\nity to polarize into different functional phenotypes in response\nto the tissue microenvironmental changes that occur during the\ndifferent phases of an in\ufb02ammatory response. This polarization\nprocess is based on the M1\u2013M2 paradigm (see below).\nPLASTICITY OF MONOCYTES/MACROPHAGES DURING\nINFLAMMATORY REACTION\nMONOCYTE RECRUITMENT DURING THE INFLAMMATORY REACTION:\nINFLAMMATORY MONOCYTE-DERIVED MACROPHAGES VS.\nTISSUE-RESIDENT MACROPHAGES AND THEIR PROLIFERATIVE ABILITY\nDuring the \ufb01rst phases of an in\ufb02ammatory reaction, there is\nin the tissue an increase of the effector cell number, necessary\nfor increasing the immune defensive \ufb01repower. These cells are\nmonocyte-derived macrophages. The concomitant drastic loss of\nresident macrophages, due to tissue adherence, emigration, or\ndeath, is a phenomenon termed \u201cthe macrophages disappearance\nreaction\u201d(146), and it is especially evident for peritoneal and alve-\nolar macrophages. To cope with the need of increasing the number\nof effector cells, two strategies come into play.\nFirst is the recruitment of blood monocytes, driven by resident\nmacrophages alongside with other tissue cells. Recruited blood\nmonocytes are a source of in\ufb02ammatory macrophages, which\ntake the name of bone marrow-derived or monocyte-derived\nin\ufb02ammatory macrophages. The other strategy is the increase of\ntissue-resident macrophage proliferation by enhancement of their\nself-renewal ability.\nCentral to the issue of monocyte recruitment is the difference in\nmonocyte subset traf\ufb01cking. Such differences have been observed\nto occur during acute and chronic in\ufb02ammation in mice, and\nunderline the fact that the monocyte subsets are under the con-\ntrol of distinct traf\ufb01cking mechanisms, with the classical subset\nbeing recruited via CCR2 and the non-classical one utilizing a\nCXCR1-dependent pathway (see Box 3).\nIn a model of Listeria monocytogenes infection, non-classical\nmonocytes (Ly6C\u2212) extravasate rapidly within 1 h, invade the sur-\nrounding tissues, and develop a very early in\ufb02ammatory response\nby producing chemokines responsible for recruiting other effec-\ntors cells (granulocytes, NK cells, T-cells), and cytokines such\nas TNF-\u03b1 (central to macrophage-mediated in\ufb02ammation and\ninnate responses) (45). This in\ufb02ammatory response is transient,\nand 8 h after infection, the main producers of in\ufb02ammatory\ncytokines in the tissue are the classical monocytes (Ly6C+). As\nBox 3\nChemokines and monocyte recruitment mechanisms.\nThe two main chemokines and related receptors involved in the in\ufb02ammation-dependent recruitment of the Ly6C+ and Ly6C\u2212monocyte\nsubsets from the blood, bone marrow, and spleen, are CCL2/CCR2 and CX3CL1/CX3CR1, respectively (45, 46). Fibroblasts, epithelial, and\nendothelial cells produce CCL2 in response to in\ufb02ammatory cytokines or microbial molecules, and generate a high level of this chemokine\nin the in\ufb02amed tissue (to allow egress of monocytes from the blood and entry in the tissues) and/or in blood (to allow entry of bone marrow\nmonocytes) (44, 147). Recently, it has been proposed that both mesenchymal cells and progenitor cells closely apposed to bone marrow\nvessels can produce CCL2 in in\ufb02ammatory situations, to allowing the egress of monocytes from the tissue and their subsequent entry\ninto the blood (148). During a bacterial infection, Ly6C+ monocytes require CCR2 for being recruited from the bone marrow into the blood\n(149). In mice lacking CX3CR1, a reduction of patrolling by Ly6C\u2212was observed (45), and a reduction of their number in infracted heart\n(150), suggesting an impaired recruitment from the blood. Genetic destruction of CCR2 reduces the accumulation of both Ly6C+ and Ly6C\u2212\nmonocytes in injured skeletal muscle, but it does not alter the recruitment of Ly6C\u2212monocytes in the heart after myocardial infarction\n(150). A reduction was also observed in skin wounds on the \ufb01rst day from injury, when Ly6C+ cells are those principally involved in the early\nrepair phases, but not during the late stage of tissue repair, when Ly6C\u2212cells are dominant (151). These studies underline the importance\nof monocyte recruitment from blood to the tissue in the injured cardiac or skeletal muscle. Regarding the role of in situ differentiation,\nin addition to the data mentioned above (150), a reduction of Ly6C\u2212monocytes has been observed also in the blood of CCR2-de\ufb01cient\nmice, despite the fact that they do not express this receptor (48). Macrophage accumulation in skin wounds is also reduced in mice lacking\nCX3CR1 (152). CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 provide a survival or anti-apoptotic signal to Ly6C\u2212cells (153). Two models have been proposed for\nthe CCL2-dependent Ly6C+ cell recruitment from the bone marrow: CCL2 increases monocyte chemokinesis and contact with blood ves-\nsels; CCL2 associates with tissue glycosaminoglycans and forms a gradient driving monocytes to exit the bone marrow for entering into\ncirculation (54). Intravenous administration of CCL2 leads to the mobilization of monocytes into the circulation, which is consistent with a\nrole for peripheral CCL2 production responsible for replenishment of circulating monocytes from bone marrow (154).\nUnder steady-state conditions, the release of Ly6C+ and Ly6C\u2212monocytes from bone marrow depends on two genes, the circadian clock\ngene Bmal1 for Ly6C+ cells (55), and the G-coupled receptor for sphingosine-1-phosphate S1PR5 for Ly6C\u2212monocytes (155). In mice with\nmyeloid cell-restricted Bmal1-de\ufb01ciency, the rhythmic release of CCL2 was ablated along with monocyte pools.Thus, myeloid cells produce\nlow diurnal levels of CCL2 in a circadian fashion, and CCL2 in turn stimulates the release of CCR2-expressing monocytes from the bone\nmarrow into the blood. On the other hand, in S1PR5-de\ufb01cient mice, Ly6C\u2212monocytes are retained in the bone marrow and are not released\nin the blood and spleen.\nwww.frontiersin.org\nOctober 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 514 | 9\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nItaliani and Boraschi\nMonocyte to macrophage differentiation\npreviously mentioned (45), it has been observed that the two\nsubsets of monocytes differentiate into two distinct cells types.\nLy6C\u2212patrolling monocytes initiate a macrophage differentiation\nprogramthatresemblesthatof M2macrophages(seebelow),while\nLy6C+ monocytes differentiate into DC-like cells that resemble\nTip-DC (45). However, in other systems, this double recruit-\nment of different monocyte subsets has not been observed. Only\nLy6C+ monocytes were observed to migrate to the injured tis-\nsue in a model of skeletal muscle injury and be responsible for\nearly in\ufb02ammatory responses (156). Generally, classical mono-\ncytes in\ufb01ltrate in\ufb02amed tissues more robustly than their non-\nclassical counterparts, and their number is signi\ufb01cantly increased\nin the circulation during systemic or chronic infection (27). After\nengul\ufb01ng dying cells in the tissue, the recruited classical mono-\ncytes differentiate into cells that resemble Ly6C\u2212monocytes, and\nbecome involved in tissue repair mechanisms (156). Likewise, in\na mouse model of sterile wound (subcutaneous polyvinyl alco-\nhol sponge implantation), it has been recently demonstrated that\nLy6C+ monocytes recruited from the circulation into the skin\nacquired an in\ufb02ammatory function and, despite time of mat-\nuration was long, they matured into Ly6C\u2212macrophages with\nrepair functions (157). Yet, another situation is that of myocar-\ndial infarction, during which both monocyte subsets appear to\nhome to the same tissue at different stages of in\ufb02ammation\n(150). Speci\ufb01cally, the Ly6C+ subset \ufb01rst in\ufb01ltrates the infracted\nheart and exhibits in\ufb02ammatory functions, while the Ly6C\u2212sub-\nset is recruited at a later stage and promotes tissue healing by\nexpressing high amounts of vascular endothelial growth fac-\ntor, exhibiting angiogenic capacity, and promoting deposition of\ncollagen (150).\nIn atherosclerosis, as a model of chronic in\ufb02ammation, both\nmonocyte subsets are recruited at the same time to the acti-\nvated endothelium/plaques, and healing seems to be correlated\nwith a reduction in total monocyte recruitment (158). However,\nit was recently demonstrated that the maintenance and accumula-\ntion of monocyte-derived macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques\nmainly depend on local proliferation of bone marrow-derived\nmacrophages rather than on the in\ufb02ux of circulating monocytes\n(127, 159). In an atopic dermatitis model and in experimental\nautoimmune encephalomyelitis, a massive proliferation of LC and\nmicroglia cells has been observed (160, 161), despite a signi\ufb01-\ncant monocyte in\ufb02ux (161). In the peritoneal cavity and in the\nlung, where the macrophage disappearance phenomenon occurs\nupon bacterial and virus insults, the few remaining macrophages\nare responsible for repopulating the tissue (86, 101, 106). Sim-\nilarly, in the context of Th2-mediated immunity against nema-\ntode infection, IL-4 drives tissue-resident macrophage expansion\nin the pleural cavity in the absence of peripheral monocyte\nrecruitment (102).\nProliferation of macrophages is observed in a variety of human\ndiseases [see Ref. (91)], including tumor-associated macrophages\nin solid tumors (162), and adipose tissue-associated macrophages\nin obesity (163).\nIn this context, a question is still open. Having established\nthat monocytes are recruited into tissues during an in\ufb02amma-\ntory event, to what extent are they capable to differentiate in\ntissue macrophages and to proliferate? As proposed by Jenkins\nand Hume, the negligible contribution of monocytes to the pool\nof resident macrophages could be due to the fact that mono-\ncyte recruitment is speci\ufb01cally aiming at providing a population\nof functionally differentiated cells needed for resolving an acute\nin\ufb02ammatory event, rather than being triggered by the home-\nostatic need of maintaining the autonomous pool of resident\nmacrophages (9). This view is supported by another interesting\nhypothesis, i.e., in in\ufb02ammatory conditions, monocyte-derived\nmacrophages are mostly end-type killer cells, as the non-speci\ufb01c\ntoxic molecules they produce will also cause their own death (164).\nThe gastrointestinal tract provides evidence in favor of this\nhypothesis. In the gut, blood monocytes are constantly recruited\nto the tissue where they contribute to maintaining the resi-\ndent macrophage population, but during an in\ufb02ammatory event\nthey re-program their differentiation plan toward adopting an\nin\ufb02ammatory phenotype (57, 165).\nThus, we should consider that monocyte-derived macrophages\nadopt different and opposing phenotypes based on microenvi-\nronmental signals. Adoption of a phenotype or another depends\non the time by which the sequential waves of recruited Ly6C+\nmonocytes reach the tissue during the course of the in\ufb02amma-\ntory reaction, since the incoming monocytes will \ufb01nd a different\nmicroenvironment in different phases of the reaction. In this con-\ntext, it is conceivable that monocytes entering the tissue at later\ntimes could \ufb01nd conditions favorable to adopting an M2-like phe-\nnotype (see above), thereby becoming tissue macrophages over\ntime.\nIn\ufb02ammatory monocyte-derived macrophages (12,86) and tis-\nsue monocytes (64) can be phenotypically and functionally distin-\nguished from resident macrophages in many tissues. In the central\nnervous system, in\ufb02ammatory monocyte-derived macrophages\ndo not contribute to the resident population (161). In con-\ntrast, fate-mapping experiments revealed that monocyte-derived\nmacrophages recruited to the peritoneal cavity upon thioglycol-\nlate injection differentiate into resident macrophages and persist\nover time (48). The fraction of monocyte-derived macrophages\nthat do not die upon in\ufb02ammation and become tissue-resident\nmacrophages share gene pro\ufb01ling with resident macrophages (45,\n64, 165), but there is no information as to whether they are\nfunctionally different or not.\nThe accumulation of in\ufb02ammatory monocytes in an in\ufb02amed\ntissue is due to their in\ufb02ux from blood rather than by their prolif-\nerative ability, and in fact in\ufb02ammatory signals of microbial origin\ngenerally prevent their proliferation. An exception to this general\nparadigm comes from a recent study that has demonstrated that\nalso in\ufb02ammatory monocyte-derived macrophages can prolifer-\nate at certain stages during the resolution of zymosan-induced\nperitonitis (106).\nAll these \ufb01ndings are summarized in Figure 3.\nFinally, two issues should be reminded:\n1. The precise nature and extent of the contribution of monocyte-\nderived macrophages to tissue macrophages could depend on\nhow,and to which extent,in\ufb02ammation or its cause has affected\nthe tissue-resident macrophages. In this view, as proposed by\nGinhoux and Jung (90), tissue-resident macrophages are more\ninvolved in tissue macrophage repopulation after mild injury,\nFrontiers in Immunology | In\ufb02ammation\nOctober 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 514 | 10\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nItaliani and Boraschi\nMonocyte to macrophage differentiation\nFIGURE 3 | Schematic representation of monocyte and macrophage\npopulations in homeostasis and in\ufb02ammation. Under homeostatic\nconditions (left panel), Ly6C+ monocytes derive from the bone marrow and\ncirculate via the blood into the tissue. A minor fraction of these cells lose\nLy6C expression and become Ly6C\u2212monocytes in the blood or in the bone\nmarrow where some of them might return in the absence of in\ufb02ammation.\nLy6C+ blood monocytes enter tissues and become either macrophages, for\nexample, in the gut, lung, and dermis (monocyte-derived macrophages or\nmonocyte-derived tissue-resident macrophages). Some tissue\nmacrophages derive directly from yolk sac during the embryogenesis (e.g.,\nLC, microglia, liver Kupffer cells, and alveolar macrophages), are long lived,\nand are mainly maintained by self-renewal (tissue-resident macrophages).\nLy6C\u2212monocytes act as resident macrophages of the vasculature,\npatrolling, and monitoring the endothelial surface in the blood vessel lumen.\nIn the \ufb01gure, the presence of \u201ctrained\u201d macrophages is also considered,\nwhich we de\ufb01ne as \u201cmemory macrophages,\u201d i.e., the tissue macrophages\nthat retain the memory of a previous in\ufb02ammation and are in a quiescent\nstate in the tissue. During an in\ufb02ammatory reaction (right panel), the\nnumber of blood Ly6C+ monocytes recruited to an in\ufb02amed tissue increases\nconsiderably. The large majority of these cells gives rise to the in\ufb02ammatory\nmonocyte-derived macrophages, while some of them do not differentiate\ninto macrophages and remain monocyte-like cells, are able to take up\nantigens, and to migrate to the draining lymph nodes (tissue monocytes).\nThese are the antigen-uptaking and -presenting cells of the tissue. During\nin\ufb02ammation, all macrophages (tissue-resident macrophages,\nmonocyte-derived tissue macrophages, in\ufb02ammatory monocyte-derived\nmacrophages) are activated and differentiate into M1-like in\ufb02ammatory cells\nfollowing interaction with pathogenic and damaged signals/insults in\nsurrounding microenvironment. These cells produce a series of cytokines\nand other in\ufb02ammatory factors. Tissue-resident macrophages increase their\ncapacity of proliferation to compensate the loss of macrophages caused by\nthe in\ufb02ammatory reaction. Recent evidence demonstrates that also\nin\ufb02ammatory monocyte-derived macrophages are able to proliferate in a late\nphase of the in\ufb02ammatory reaction. Memory macrophages are important\nplayers in the in\ufb02ammatory reaction, as they can react to in\ufb02ammatory\nstimuli with a faster and stronger in\ufb02ammatory cytokine production.The role\nof circulating Ly6C\u2212cells during an in\ufb02ammatory reaction is not fully\nidenti\ufb01ed.

In the mouse it seems that non-classical monocytes contribute\nto the resident macrophage population. It is possible (although\nthere is little evidence in this respect) that when non-classical\nmonocytes are recruited in the in\ufb02amed tissue, they may differ-\nentiate into alternatively activated macrophages, while classical\nmonocytes would give rise to classically activated macrophages.\nIn this context, the developmental relationship between the\ndifferent monocyte subsets and the different macrophage func-\ntional phenotypes has yet to be fully and formally proven. No\nevidence in this sense has been generated yet in human being\n(see below).\nMACROPHAGE DIFFERENTIATION AND FUNCTIONAL PHENOTYPES\nMacrophage polarization occurs through different activation pro-\ngrams by which macrophages carry out their defensive functions.\nIn this way, macrophages become able to respond with appro-\npriate functions in distinct contexts, functional diversity becom-\ning the key feature of these cells. Essentially, macrophages can\nmodify their metabolic functions from a heal/growth promoting\nsetting (M2 macrophages), to a killing/inhibitory capacity (M1\nmacrophages) (145, 166). The main difference between these cells\nis that in M2 macrophages the arginine metabolism is shifted to\nornithine and polyamines, while in M1 cells it is shifted to NO\nand citrulline (166). M2-produced ornithine can promote cell\nproliferation and repair through polyamine and collagen synthe-\nsis, \ufb01brosis and other tissue remodeling functions (167), while\nM1-produced NO is an important effector molecule with micro-\nbicidal activity and cell proliferation inhibitory capacity (168).\nInterestingly, polyamine production per se has been reported to\nbe a driver of M2 polarization (169), and M2 is the normal\n\u201cdefault\u201d program adopted by resident macrophages (170). More-\nover, M1 and M2 macrophages have distinct features in terms\nof chemokine production pro\ufb01les (171), and iron and glucose\nmetabolism (172, 173).\nThe description of macrophages polarization is leading immu-\nnologists to take a step back and revise their concept on how\nthe immune system works (14, 145). The M1 and M2 de\ufb01-\nnition was formulated by mirroring the Th1/Th2 polarization\nconcept. However, this de\ufb01nition might be misleading in that\nit may suggest that Th1/Th2 cells do instruct M1/M2 polar-\nization, whereas it is now obvious that the reverse is true, i.e.,\nmacrophages are initiating and directing T-cell polarization. Since\nit has been shown that distinct populations of macrophages pro-\nmote and control CD4+ T-cell-dependent type 1 and type 2\nimmune in\ufb02ammatory responses (i.e., those against viruses and\nbacteria, and against multicellular parasites, respectively), not\nsurprisingly they have been termed M1 and M2 (166). Thus,\nconsidering that macrophages recognize pathogens directly (174,\n175), while T-cell do not, and considering that T-cells prolif-\nerate through interaction with macrophages (176), it is logical\nto think that macrophages are the cells that initiate and direct\nT-cell response, and that the adaptive immune response needs\nthe triggering and guidance of innate immunity (14). Notably,\nM1 and M2 macrophage activities do not need the presence of\nlymphocytes (145). The fact that T-cell-derived cytokines such\nas IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 may amplify macrophage polarization (see\nbelow) should not deceive us into believing that macrophage\npolarization cannot occur without lymphocytes, as this is not\nthe case. In vitro, macrophages are activated toward an M1 func-\ntional program by infectious microorganism-related molecules\n(e.g., the gram-negative product LPS) and by in\ufb02ammation-\nrelated cytokines TNF-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3, alone or in combination. M1\nmacrophages are characterized in vitro by an IL-12hiIL-23hiIL-\n10lo phenotype; are ef\ufb01cient producers of toxic effector molecules\n(ROS and NO) and in\ufb02ammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF, IL-\n6); participate as inducers and effector cells in polarized Th1\nresponses; and mediate resistance against intracellular parasites\nand tumors (177). Conversely, M2-like polarization has been\nobserved in vitro in response to the Th2-related cytokines IL-4\nor IL-13 (178), to the concomitant triggering of Fc\u03b3 receptors\nand Toll-like receptors (TLR), to immune complexes, and to\nanti-in\ufb02ammatory molecules such as IL-10, TGF-\u03b2, and gluco-\ncorticoids (115). The variety of functional programs adopted by\nmacrophages in response to the stimuli listed above has been\ntermed M2a (IL-4 and IL-13; alternative in\ufb02ammation), M2b\n(immunecomplexes,Fc\u03b3R/TLRtriggering),andM2c(IL-10,TGF-\n\u03b2, glucocorticoids; deactivation) (178, 179). M2 cells are charac-\nterized in vitro by an IL-12loIL-23loIL-10hiTGF-\u03b2hi phenotype and\ngenerally have high levels of scavenger, mannose, and galactose-\ntypereceptors.Ingeneral,thesemacrophagestakepartinpolarized\nTh2 responses, allergy, parasites clearance, dampening of in\ufb02am-\nmation, tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, immunoregulation, and\ntumor promotion (180).\nMacrophage taxonomy is an attempt to rationally categorize an\nextended variety of cell functions. Indeed, the M1/M2 paradigm\nis a limited attempt to de\ufb01ne the complexity and plasticity of\nmononuclear phagocytes. In vivo, macrophages can adopt a vari-\nety of functional phenotypes depending on subtle and continuous\nchanges in the tissue microenvironment. So, the M1/M2 polariza-\ntion of macrophage functions may be taken as a simpli\ufb01ed con-\nceptual framework describing a continuum of diverse functional\nstates, of which M1 and M2 activation states are not ontogeni-\ncally de\ufb01ned subsets but represent the extremes (180\u2013182). In this\nregard, Mosser and Edwards (181) have suggested a macrophage\nclassi\ufb01cation that takes into account the three functions of these\ncells in maintaining homeostasis: host defense, wound healing,\nand immune regulation. Classifying macrophages according to\nthese functions provides three basic macrophage populations:\nclassically activated macrophages, wound-healing macrophages,\nand regulatory macrophages (183, 184). The authors believe that\nthis classi\ufb01cation also helps to illustrate how macrophages can\nevolve to exhibit characteristics that are shared by more than one\nmacrophage population (181).\nWithout going into details [for which we refer the reader\nto other reviews; (14, 185)], the M1/M2 classi\ufb01cation in differ-\nent subsets can create the illusory perception of a heterogeneity,\nwhich is not proven to exist in vivo. Thus, as already mentioned\nabove, it is logical to hypothesize that the subsets are varying mix-\ntures of M1- and M2-type macrophages, as observed in the lung\nand in the peritoneal cavity, where tissue-speci\ufb01c variations in\nthe balance of M1- and M2-type responses have been revealed\n(74, 186). This situation has also been observed in pathological\nFrontiers in Immunology | In\ufb02ammation\nOctober 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 514 | 12\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nItaliani and Boraschi\nMonocyte to macrophage differentiation\nconditions, where macrophages can develop mixed M1 and M2\nphenotypes (187,188). Moreover,it has also been proposed to con-\nsider the heterogeneity of macrophage functions as a consequence\nof interaction with different immunological pathways (e.g., inter-\naction with different growth and survival factors, interaction with\nlymphoid and myeloid cytokines, interaction with pathogens, res-\nolution), rather than attributing them to distinct macrophages\nsubsets (185).\nIn summary, the initial in\ufb02ammatory response is carried out\nby activated macrophages in classical or alternative modality\n(depending on the triggering events),aiming at eliminating invad-\ning microbes by promoting the in\ufb02ammatory response. Then, the\nresolution phase is carried out by macrophages in deactivated\nmodality, unresponsive to in\ufb02ammatory stimuli, and active in the\nelimination of the injured cells and tissue components, in pro-\nmoting angiogenesis, cell proliferation, matrix deposition, and in\ngeneral in tissue remodeling. The mechanisms that account for\nmacrophage deactivation play a key role in maintaining home-\nostasis and keeping the immune response under control (189).\nBoth innate and adaptive signals can in\ufb02uence the macrophage\nfunctional phenotype, which can have potentially dangerous con-\nsequences if not appropriately regulated. For example, classically\nactivated M1 macrophages can cause damage to host tissues,\npredispose surrounding tissue to neoplastic transformation and\nin\ufb02uence glucose metabolism by promoting insulin resistance.\nMacrophages that are normally involved in wound healing can\npromote \ufb01brosis,exacerbate allergic responses,and be exploited by\npathogens for intracellular survival. These M2-type macrophages\ncancontributetotheprogressionof neoplasiabypromotingtumor\nsurvival (see Table 3).\nCURRENT HYPOTHESIS ON MACROPHAGE POLARIZATION\nPlasticity and \ufb02exibility are key features of macrophages and of\ntheir activation states. A controversial issue is whether a pheno-\ntypic and functional evolution of macrophages occurs in vivo, and\nhow it happens. As mentioned above, it has been observed in mice\nthat the M1 to M2 switch during the progression of the in\ufb02amma-\ntory response enables macrophages to perform different activities\nin the different phases of the reaction. The controversy refers to\nthe mechanisms underlying this switch, i.e., whether M1 and M2\nmacrophages are phenotypically distinct subpopulations that can\nserve different functions in different phases of an in\ufb02ammatory\nreaction (45, 150), or the same cells can shift from one to another\nfunctional phenotype in response to microenvironmental signals\n(156, 157).\nSeveral hypotheses are attempting to explain the issue. A \ufb01rst\nhypothesis is that different subsets of monocytes or macrophages\ncan adopt a different functional phenotype. Thus, Ly6C+ mono-\ncytes and/or monocyte-derived macrophages in the tissue become\nM1 macrophages, and Ly6C\u2212monocytes and/or tissue-resident\nmacrophages become M2 macrophages. It is possible that resi-\ndent macrophages maintain cytoprotective and reparative func-\ntions, whereas macrophages derived from circulating in\ufb02amma-\ntory monocytes perform mainly M1 type functions. This hypoth-\nesis is not fully supported by the studies previously cited, where in\ndifferent situations it was possible to observe both the differentia-\ntion of Ly6C+ cells in M1 and of Ly6C\u2212cells in M2 (45, 150) and\nthe transdifferentiation from Ly6C+ M1 cells to Ly6C\u2212M2 cells\n(156, 157).\nA second hypothesis is that there are sequential waves of\nmonocyte recruitment into a tissue throughout the course of\nan in\ufb02ammatory reaction. Therefore, monocytes recruited into\nthe tissue at different times encounter different microenviron-\nments with different signals that can polarize them in M1 dur-\ning early phases and in M2 in late phases (156). In this case,\ncytokines and other microenvironmental signals in the tissue play\na key role in determining the different functional phenotypes\nof macrophages. Although the role of cytokines in steering the\nmacrophage functional phenotypes has been proven in vitro (179),\nthe situation could be very different in vivo, where M2 activity\nis strongly increased in sterile wounds (157) or injured kidney\n(190) in absence of Th2-like cytokines IL-4 or IL-13 (which in\nany case do not induce the typical M2 phenotype, i.e., the deacti-\nvated healing/repairing functional phenotype). In these cases, M2\nmacrophages derive largely from M1 macrophages, with mono-\ncytes recruited from the circulation \ufb01rst acquiring an in\ufb02amma-\ntory phenotype, and then persisting in the tissue and maturing\ninto repair macrophages.\nBased on the latter data, a third hypothesis is that polarized\nmacrophage populations can switch one to the other in response\nto different conditions. Data from in vitro studies demonstrate\nthat human monocytes can acquire the phenotype of polarized\nM1 macrophages and then mature into M2 repair macrophages\nupon exposure in culture to sequential changes in the microen-\nvironmental conditions (191). Other studies demonstrated that\nM2 macrophages are reprogramed to express M1 genes following\nexposure to TLR ligands or IFN-\u03b3 (192, 193).\nA related question is whether both tissue-resident macrophages\nand monocyte-derived macrophages can polarize in M1 or/and\nM2 functional phenotypes. We have described above that tissue\nmacrophages have basically an M2-like phenotype, whereas in\ufb01l-\ntrating recruited monocytes differentiate in M1 or M2 depending\non the tissue conditions. For instance, it has been shown that\ntissue-resident macrophages, rather than recruited monocytes, are\nalternatively activated in the tissue during infection with Lito-\nmosoides sigmodondis (102). Also, recruited monocytes can be\ndirectly polarized into an anti-in\ufb02ammatory M2 phenotype by\nbasophil-derived IL-4, in order to alleviate allergic in\ufb02amma-\ntion in the skin (194). Although it is not possible discriminat-\ning between tissue-resident and monocyte-derived macrophages\nin steady-state conditions, it seems that alternatively activated\ntissue macrophages have a transcriptional pro\ufb01le and pheno-\ntype different from that of alternatively activated monocyte-\nderived macrophages, with the latter having immunoregulatory\nproperties (195).\nIt should be considered that in vitro studies do not fully\nrecapitulate in vivo differentiation for two main reasons:\n1. These studies are generally based on an heterogeneous popula-\ntion of monocytes, encompassing all the blood subsets (Ly6C+\nand Ly6C\u2212in the mouse, and CD14+ and CD16+ in human\nbeing),thus it cannot be de\ufb01ned whether upon different stimuli\nthe same cells can pass from a phenotype to another or whether\ndifferent subsets are activated in response to different stimuli.\nwww.frontiersin.org\nOctober 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 514 | 13\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nItaliani and Boraschi\nMonocyte to macrophage differentiation\n2. While M2 macrophages can convert to the M1 phenotype, the\nreverse generally does not occur, or it may only occur in par-\nticular conditions (e.g., in very mild in\ufb02ammatory responses).\nIn fact, M1 is probably an end-stage killer cell that dies during\nthe in\ufb02ammatory response, possibly succumbing to its own\nNO production, as it was demonstrated in vitro (196). So, their\nselective death may give the impression that they convert in\nM2 cells, which in fact proportionally increase (145). It seems\nthat M1 vs. M2 polarization correlates with the capacity of\nmacrophages to produce NO (166) as opposed to the important\nM2 driver TGF-\u03b2 (164, 197, 198), thus the decrease in NO-\nproducing macrophages would increase TGF-\u03b2 production and\namplify M2 polarization.\nThere are cases in which a phenotypic switch in the macrophage\npopulation occurs over time, often associated with pathology (91,\n141). Three speci\ufb01c examples of this phenotypic switch are the\nfollowing:\nendotoxin tolerance, an altered state of responsiveness to sec-\nondary stimulation with LPS, resulting in a global and sustained\nswitch of the gene expression program from an in\ufb02ammatory\nM1 signature to an anti-in\ufb02ammatory phenotype (199);\nobesity-induced insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes, and ather-\nosclerosis lesions. These are metabolic syndromes that can lead\nto a switch in the phenotype of adipose tissue macrophages\nfrom wound healing (as in healthy non-obese human beings)\nto classically activated macrophages (200, 201);\ncancer,\nwhere\nthe\ntumor-in\ufb01ltrating\nclassically\nactivated\nmacrophages have the potential to contribute to the earliest stages\nof neoplasia (202\u2013204), and then, as the tumor progresses, can\nprogressively differentiate to a regulatory phenotype and eventu-\nally become cells that share the characteristics of both regulatory\nand wound-healing macrophages (181).\nAlthough the pathology provides the proof-of-principle that\nmacrophages can undergo dynamic transitions between differ-\nent functional states, it is possible that a mixture of M1/M2\nphenotypes underlies these conditions (14, 145, 166). In the\npast few years, gene expression pro\ufb01ling techniques and genetic\napproaches have been used to cast some light on the plas-\nticity of macrophage activation. The commonly held view is\nthat macrophage polarization is driven by cues in the tissue\nmicroenvironment, which can include cytokines, growth fac-\ntors, and microorganism-associated molecular patterns. These\nsignals are thought to dictate a transcriptional response that\nshapes the phenotype and function of macrophages based on the\nphysiological or pathological context. Progress has been made\nin de\ufb01ning the molecular mechanism underlying macrophage\npolarization, including signaling pathways, miRNA, epigenetic\nmodi\ufb01cation, post-transcriptional regulators, and transcriptional\nfactors (189, 205\u2013207). However, the data are still incomplete\nand far from being systematic, and our knowledge of the\nmechanistic basis of macrophage diversity in different tissues\nor in response to changing environment is to a large extent\nunknown.\nPOST-INFLAMMATION FATE OF\nMONOCYTES/MACROPHAGES\nANTIGEN PRESENTATION IN NON-LYMPHOID ORGANS\nThe capacity of taking up and presenting antigen (i.e., the link-\ning function between innate and adaptive immunity) is one of\nthe most important features of tissue macrophages (208). It has\nbeen mentioned above that some monocytes that enter the tissue\nduring in\ufb02ammation do not differentiate into macrophages, and\nare able to take up antigen in the tissue and carry it to lymph\nnodes where they can present it to na\u00efve T-cells (64). In addi-\ntion to this population of monocyte-like cells, tissue macrophages\nare also able to present antigen, despite the fact that they do\nnot recirculate to lymph nodes after antigen uptake. That tissue\nmacrophages are highly phagocytic and can take up microorgan-\nisms and other matter in the tissue is well known, as this is their\nmajor function both in homeostasis and during in\ufb02ammation.\nThat antigen presentation may occur also in non-lymphoid organs\nhas been suggested by several experimental evidence describing\nantigen-speci\ufb01c local activation and expansion of primed T-cells,\nbut not of na\u00efve T-cells (209\u2013215). Based on this evidence, the\nhypothesis proposed by Ley is that initial priming of na\u00efve T-\ncells occurs in the lymph node (to which antigen-loaded tissue\nmonocytes recirculate), but that the full activation and effector\nfunctions of T-cells occur in the tissue where the in\ufb02ammatory\nreaction is taking place, upon the productive interaction and for-\nmation of immunological synapse between primed T-cells and the\nantigen-presenting tissue macrophages (the difference between\nmonocyte-derived tissue DC and tissue macrophages is bleared,\nas they seem to be not much more than slightly different func-\ntional differentiation states from a common precursor). Most\nlikely, the in\ufb02ammatory monocyte-derived cells with an M1-like\nfunctional phenotype are the antigen-presenting cells (APC) that\ninduce activation/polarization of effector Th1 and Th17 cells upon\nproduction of IL-12 and IL-23, respectively, and in a TNFRSF\nand TNFSF-dependent fashion (but independent of CD80, CD86,\nand CD28 co-stimulation). Likewise, M2-like tissue macrophages,\nwhich produce TGF-\u03b2 and express the \u03b1V\u03b28 integrin are likely\ninvolved in the polarization of iTreg cells, whereas their role in\nTh2 polarization is less clear (208).\nFATE OF ACTIVATED RESIDENT MACROPHAGES AND RECRUITED\nMONOCYTES: PROLIFERATION, REPLACEMENT, AND M2-LIKE\nPOLARIZATION\nBased on what described above, the cell populations present in the\ntissue during the acute phase of an in\ufb02ammatory reaction are the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 Tissue-residentmacrophagesandmonocyte-derivedmacrophages.\nThese, after initial recognition of microbial or damage-\nassociated molecules, drive the in\ufb02ux of blood-derived mono-\ncytes, which will become in\ufb02ammatory macrophages.

Here, we consider them as a kind\nof resident in\ufb02ammatory monocyte-derived macrophage, able\nto react in a faster and stronger manner compared to other\nmacrophages.\nA summary of the different macrophage types and of their fate\nafter the acute in\ufb02ammatory phase is given in Figure 4.\nIn general, tissue-resident macrophages are maintained locally\nby proliferative self-renewal (100,106),and retain an M2-like phe-\nnotype, for example, in the peritoneal cavity, brain, and lung (86,\n100, 161). The fate of monocyte-derived resident macrophages is\nhard to follow, considering that it is not possible to fully discrim-\ninate between them. However, we may hypothesize that they have\nthe same fate of tissue-resident macrophages, i.e., they maintain\nan M2-like phenotype and a low self-renewal capacity. A number\nof cells of both populations probably die during in\ufb02ammation,\nthe extent of their survival possibly depending on the nature and\nmagnitude of the insult.\nGenerally, the in\ufb02ammatory monocyte-derived macrophages\nare polarized toward M1, and the majority of them dies, killed\nby their own NO production (see above). In an experimen-\ntal acute lung injury model, these cells undergo Fas-mediated\ndeath, while the resident alveolar cells persist (217). From that,\nwe can argue that M1 likely is a terminal differentiation pheno-\ntype. However, there are reports that they can also undergo in situ\nphenotype conversation to become tissue-resident macrophages\neither during in\ufb02ammation or after experimental deletion of tissue\nmacrophages (48,86). This underlines the notion that macrophage\npolarization is both transient and plastic.\nThe survival in the tissue of in\ufb02ammatory monocyte-derived\nmacrophages raises important questions that need to be answered.\nDo monocyte-derived tissue macrophages conserve a \u201cmem-\nory\u201d of their past in\ufb02ammatory activation, thereby becoming\nmemory macrophages? And, do tissue macrophages resume their\nprevious functional phenotype in response to a new in\ufb02ammatory\nchallenge? Or, do they react as na\u00efve cells?\nMemory macrophages (also recently termed \u201ctrained mono-\ncytes\u201d) have been described, which retain a memory of past chal-\nlenges (see below). Their fate in the tissue is, however, unknown,\nsince no long-term experiments have been performed in mam-\nmals. It is possible that a part of them dies after reacting to a\nnew in\ufb02ammatory challenge. If some of them survive (again, this\npossibly depends on the type and magnitude of the new chal-\nlenge), they would probably behave like in\ufb02ammatory monocyte-\nderived macrophages,i.e.,they could become M2-like cells,having\na low level of self-renewal, and may also form a new popula-\ntion of memory macrophages that retain the memory of multiple\nchallenges.\nFIGURE 4 | Fate of the different monocyte/macrophage populations in\nthe tissue during the post-in\ufb02ammatory phase. Tissue-resident\nmacrophages are in general maintained locally by proliferative self-renewal,\nand retain an M2-like functional phenotype. The same situation is\nhypothesized for monocyte-derived resident macrophages, since it is not\npossible to fully discriminate between the two populations. A number of\ncells of these two populations probably die during the in\ufb02ammatory\nreaction. In\ufb02ammatory monocyte-derived macrophages can die killed by\nthe NO they have produced, and the surviving cells can undergo in situ\nphenotype conversion and become M2-like tissue-resident macrophages.\nIn addition, a number of these cells can conserve a \u201cmemory\u201d of their past\nin\ufb02ammatory activation, and become trained monocytes/memory\nmacrophages. Monocytes recruited from the blood during the\npost-in\ufb02ammatory phase can lose the expression of Ly6C and become\nLy6C\u2212cells, subsequently differentiating in M2 macrophages. They may\nalso become memory macrophages. Memory macrophages that are\npresent in the tissue, reminiscent of previous in\ufb02ammatory events, would\nprobably behave like na\u00efve macrophages upon a new in\ufb02ammatory\nchallenge, except for a much quicker reaction, and will, therefore, mostly\ndie or generate M2-like macrophages or again memory macrophages. Their\nlife span in the tissue is presently unknown.\nwww.frontiersin.org\nOctober 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 514 | 15\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nItaliani and Boraschi\nMonocyte to macrophage differentiation\nAnother population that should be considered is that of mono-\ncytes recruited from the blood during the post-in\ufb02ammatory\nphase. It is possible that these cells lose Ly6C expression when\nin the tissue, thereby becoming Ly6C\u2212cells that subsequently\ndifferentiate in M2 macrophages.\nMEMORY MACROPHAGES\nIt is long known that innate immune responses are higher to a\nsecondary infection/challenge, and that this higher reactive occurs\nwhether the new challenge is the same or different from the \ufb01rst\none (cross-protection).An old example is that of mouse peritoneal\nmacrophages from BCG-infected mice that have little/no activ-\nity 7 days after infection, and acquire signi\ufb01cant citocydal activity\nupon in vitro challenge with LPS or with a wealth of other stimuli,\nwhile na\u00efve macrophages do not (218). Recently, this phenom-\nenon has been re-named trained innate immunity (219). Innate\nmemory plays an important defensive role in organisms lack-\ning adaptive immunity, such as plants and invertebrates, but it\nis evident also in vertebrates lacking functional T and B lympho-\ncytes (220). In these animals, this innate memory mechanism was\nshown to involve innate immune cells with low turnover [such as\nmacrophages and NK cells; (221, 222)] that would be responsible\nfor improved pathogen recognition through pathogen recognition\nreceptors, and for an enhanced protective in\ufb02ammatory response\n(223, 224). NK cells could generate a memory response to viruses,\nwhile macrophages retain memory of both bacterial and viral chal-\nlenges. A logical possibility is that the microorganisms encoun-\ntered by the host on a regular basis may serve to differentiating\nand continually renewing a pool of memory-like macrophages\nwith enhanced reactivity to infectious challenges. The molecular\nmechanisms responsible for shifting macrophages toward a mem-\nory status have not yet been elucidated. Putative mechanisms may\ninvolve differences in the monocyte/macrophage population (i.e.,\nCD14+ and CD16\u2212) or changes in the expression of lectin recep-\ntors on cell membrane (221), or in the functional phenotype (e.g.,\nphagocytosis or protein production), but all are probably under-\nlain by epigenetic reprograming that, through modi\ufb01cation of\nDNA, post-translational modi\ufb01cations of histones (methylation),\nor microRNA, regulates gene expression by inducing dynamic\nalterations in the chromatin structure (220). Establishment of\nmacrophage memory, depending on the experienced challenges,\nis likely to rely on epigenetic changes, as these can be at the basis\nof a rapid evolution of responsiveness and adaptation to incur-\nring events, thereby allowing to surviving to new environmental\nthreats (220, 225). Ef\ufb01cacy of many vaccines probably implies the\ninduction of non-speci\ufb01c macrophage memory that contributes\nto the increased resistance to infections. Research in the \ufb01eld of\nmemory macrophages needs a thorough re-assessment of a large\nbody of old evidence accumulated in the past decades in the areas\nof macrophage activation and of adjuvanticity.\nCONCLUSION\nAn increasing amount of evidence supports four revolutionary\nconcepts/discoveries on monocytes/macrophages that will force\nthe researcher to rewrite the books of immunology:\n1. The embryonic origin of tissue-resident macrophages, which\nraises the need to better understand the features/properties\nof monocytes (that are no longer simple precursors of tissue\nmacrophages), and those of macrophages, which are capable of\nself-renewal without loss of their differentiated cellular identity.\n2. The capacity of monocytes/macrophages to polarize into distinct\nfunctional phenotypes able to initiate and direct virtually all\nimmune responses, including adaptive ones.\n3. The notion of innate memory, an old concept that has been\nrecently revived with the description of the so-called trained\ninnate immunity.\n4. The importance of macrophage-mediated antigen presentation\nin tissue responses, with the identi\ufb01cation of antigen-uptaking,\nrecirculating, and presenting \u201ctissue monocytes,\u201d and with the\nnotion that tissue macrophages are probably the major APC\nupon a second challenge at the tissue level, without need of\nrecirculation to the lymph nodes.\nThe central role of monocytes/macrophages in this new view of\nimmunity implies that innate immunity has a major role in induc-\ning and modulating adaptive immunity (including the induction\nof polarized T-cell responses), while on the other hand taking\nadvantage of adaptive immune mechanisms (e.g., T-cell-derived\ncytokines) for modulating its own activity. Thus, new knowledge\non macrophage biology and functions will have a direct impact\non our understanding of immune responses and on the design\nof novel therapeutic strategies. For this reason, it is necessary\nto overcome several experimental obstacles that delay the full\nunderstanding of the new dynamics and relationships within the\nimmune system, and that have been identi\ufb01ed by the researchers\ncited in the review.\nFor example, to date, transcriptome analysis of monocyte sub-\nsets has been done at the basal unstimulated level, showing dra-\nmatic differences consistent with a different functional repertoire\nfor the three types of human monocytes. Circulating monocytes\nare most likely \u201cquiescent\u201d (their quiescent status is needed in\norder to avoid developing a deleterious intravascular in\ufb02amma-\ntion), while their effector functions only develop after relocation\nand activation in the tissue. Thus, the true role of the different\nmonocyte subsets could be only understood after activation, and\nthe stimulus-induced transcriptome of these cells will be required.\nFurther, the models of in\ufb02ammation used to test the prolifera-\ntive capacity of resident macrophages have so far been limited\nto one or two rounds of tissue repopulation or relatively acute\nperiods of infection/in\ufb02ammation. This obviously cannot provide\nreliable information on the long-term capacity of macrophage\nself-renewal. Moreover, when studying the plasticity and inter-\nchangeability of M1 and M2 macrophages, since mixed M1/M2\nphenotypes can be found especially in pathological conditions,it is\ncapital to focus not only on populations but also either at the single\ncell level or by lineage-tracking studies (e.g., with mice expressing\nCre ricombinase under the iNOS or arginase promoters, to track\nM1 and M2 lineages, respectively). Precautions need to be taken\nwhen drastic experimental procedures such as monocyte deple-\ntion or parabiosis are used to study macrophages self-renewal.\nThese treatments can alter the concentration of circulating CSF-\n1 and CSFR1 signaling, which are important for self-renewal of\nresident macrophages under homeostatic conditions, and crit-\nical for differentiation of monocytes into tissue macrophages.\nFrontiers in Immunology | In\ufb02ammation\nOctober 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 514 | 16\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nItaliani and Boraschi\nMonocyte to macrophage differentiation\nLikewise, precautions and appropriate controls need to be imple-\nmented when using CCR2-de\ufb01cient mouse for studying monocyte\nrecruitment to the tissue, since the CCL2/CCR2 chemokine sys-\ntem is also responsible of the release of monocytes from bone\nmarrow. Thus, the lack of recruitment of monocytes from the\nblood to the tissue could be due to lack of release of monocytes\nfrom bone marrow to the blood, where circulating monocytes are\ndecreased.\nOur \ufb01nal recommendation, therefore, is probably obvious, but\nit is anyway important to state it again. We need to re-evaluate\npatiently and critically a huge body of experimental evidence that\nis already present in the literature. In particular, we need to over-\ncome the lack of consensus in de\ufb01ning and describing the different\nmacrophage phenotypes (226). Many old studies have already gen-\nerated information that, in light of our present knowledge, can\nbecome very important and help us to clarify the general picture.\nSecond recommendation is that of designing experiments very\ncarefully, keeping in mind that the immune system is redundant\nand that the same factor can have different activities, and that the\nsame activity can be carried out by different factors. Third recom-\nmendation: monocytes and macrophages are never isolated in the\nbody, and what they do and what they become are totally in\ufb02u-\nencedbythesurroundingcellsandtissue.Invitro systemsmayonly\npartially reproduce this complexity. Last recommendation: con-\nsider evolution as an incommensurable and most precious source\nof information that can greatly help us understand the ontology\nand behavior of monocytes and macrophages. Common mech-\nanisms are many, and also species-speci\ufb01c differences exist, thus\nwe should be able to pick up the relevant common information\nwithout, however, forgetting that human being is not a mouse or\na mosquito.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nPaola Italiani wrote the paper; Diana Boraschi contributed to\nwriting and critically revised the paper.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors wish to thank Dr. Charles Mills for helpful discus-\nsion and for his continuous assistance in writing this review.\nThey also thank El\ufb01T\u00f6pfer for \ufb01gure design and realization.
