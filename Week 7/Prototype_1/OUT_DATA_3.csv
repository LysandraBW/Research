Introduction
Macrophages are an essential component of innate immunity and 
play a central role in inflammation and host defense (1). More-
over, these cells fulfill homeostatic functions beyond defense, 
including tissue remodeling in ontogenesis and orchestration of 
metabolic functions (1–3).
Cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage are characterized by 
considerable diversity and plasticity. In tissues, mononuclear phago-
cytes respond to environmental cues (e.g., microbial products, dam-
aged cells, activated lymphocytes) with the acquisition of distinct 
functional phenotypes. In response to various signals, macrophages 
may undergo classical M1 activation (stimulated by TLR ligands and 
IFN-γ) or alternative M2 activation (stimulated by IL-4/IL-13); these 
states mirror the Th1–Th2 polarization of T cells (2, 4).
The M1 phenotype is characterized by the expression of high 
levels of proinflammatory cytokines, high production of reactive 
nitrogen and oxygen intermediates, promotion of Th1 response, 
and strong microbicidal and tumoricidal activity. In contrast, M2 
macrophages are considered to be involved in parasite containment 
and promotion of tissue remodeling and tumor progression and to 
have immunoregulatory functions. They are characterized by effi-
cient phagocytic activity, high expression of scavenging molecules, 
the expression of mannose and galactose receptors, production of 
ornithine and polyamines through the arginase pathway, and an 
IL-12loIL-10hiIL-1decoyRhiIL-1RAhi phenotype (1, 4). M1-M2 mac-
rophages also are distinct in their chemokine expression profiles.
Signals including IL-10, glucocorticoid hormones, molecules 
released from apoptotic cells, and immune complexes also pro-
foundly affect monocyte-macrophage function. These signals induce 
expression of functional phenotypes that share selected properties 
with M2 cells (e.g., high mannose and scavenger receptor expression), 
but are distinct from them, for instance, in terms of the chemokine 
repertoire. Operationally, we refer to these cells as M2 like (5).
Plasticity and flexibility are key features of mononuclear 
phagocytes and of their activation states (2, 4, 6). The pheno-
type of polarized M1-M2 macrophages can, to some extent, be 
reversed in vitro and in vivo (7, 8). Moreover, pathology is fre-
quently associated with dynamic changes in macrophage activa-
tion, with classically activated M1 cells implicated in initiating 
and sustaining inflammation and M2 or M2-like cells associ-
ated with resolution or smoldering chronic inflammation (9). 
It remains unclear whether the mechanism of these switches 
involves the recruitment of circulating precursors or the reeduca-
tion of cells in situ. However, it is now apparent that specialized 
or polarized T cells (Th1, Th2, Tregs) that are key orchestrators 
of macrophage polarized activation (2) also exhibit previously 
unsuspected flexibility and plasticity (10).
Here, we will focus on recent progress in understanding the 
molecular basis underlying macrophage polarization, including 
signaling pathways, transcription factors, and epigenetic regula-
tion. Moreover, the dynamics and limitations in our understand-
ing of polarized macrophage activation in vivo will be discussed, 
focusing on selected pathological conditions (for references to 
pathology not discussed here, see Supplemental References; sup-
plemental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/
JCI59643DS1). Previous reviews also provide a framework for 
this work (1–3, 6, 11).
Molecular determinants of macrophage polarization
A network of signaling molecules, transcription factors, epigenetic 
mechanisms, and posttranscriptional regulators underlies the dif-
ferent forms of macrophage activation. Canonical IRF/STAT sig-
naling pathways are activated by IFNs and TLR signaling to skew 
macrophage function toward the M1 phenotype (via STAT1) or by 
IL-4 and IL-13 to skew toward the M2 phenotype (via STAT6) (3). 
M1 macrophages upregulate IRF5, which is essential for induction 
of cytokines (IL-12, IL-23, TNF) involved in eliciting Th1 and Th17 
responses (12). The IL-4 type I and type II receptors (1, 13) acti-
vate Stat6, which in turn activates transcription of genes typical 
of M2 polarization, e.g., mannose receptor (Mrc1), resistin-like α

Diversity and plasticity are hallmarks of cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. In response to 
IFNs, Toll-like receptor engagement, or IL-4/IL-13 signaling, macrophages undergo M1 (classical) 
or M2 (alternative) activation, which represent extremes of a continuum in a universe of activation 
states. Progress has now been made in defining the signaling pathways, transcriptional networks, 
and epigenetic mechanisms underlying M1-M2 or M2-like polarized activation. Functional skew-
ing of mononuclear phagocytes occurs in vivo under physiological conditions (e.g., ontogenesis 
and pregnancy) and in pathology (allergic and chronic inflammation, tissue repair, infection, and 
cancer). However, in selected preclinical and clinical conditions, coexistence of cells in different activation states 
and unique or mixed phenotypes have been observed, a reflection of dynamic changes and complex tissue-derived 
signals. The identification of mechanisms and molecules associated with macrophage plasticity and polarized acti-
vation provides a basis for macrophage-centered diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

(Retnla, Fizz1), and chitinase 3–like 3 (Chi3l3, Ym1) (14). IL-10 acti-
vates STAT3-mediated expression of genes (Il10, Tgfb1, Mrc1) asso-
ciated with an M2-like phenotype (4, 15, 16).
STAT-mediated activation of macrophages is regulated by mem-
bers of the SOCS family. IL-4 and IFN-γ, the latter in concert with 
TLR stimulation, upregulate SOCS1 and SOCS3, which in turn 
inhibit the action of STAT1 and STAT3, respectively (17, 18).
Downstream of, or in parallel with, the IRF/STAT/SOCS pathway, 
a panel of transcription factors orchestrates polarized macrophage 
activation. The nuclear receptors PPARγ (19) and PPARδ (20, 21) con-
trol distinct subsets of genes associated with M2 macrophage activa-
tion and oxidative metabolism (Figure 1). Interestingly, STAT6 coor-
dinates and synergizes with both PPARγ (22) and Krüppel-like factor 4  
(KLF4), a member of a family of proteins that contribute to macro-
phage function (23, 24). KLF4 cooperates with Stat6 to induce M2 
genes (Arg-1, Mrc1, Fizz1, PPARγ) and inhibit M1 genes (TNFa, Cox-2,  
CCL5, iNOS) via sequestration of coactivators required for NF-κB acti-
vation. KLF2 regulates macrophage activation by inhibiting NF-κB/ 
HIF-1α activities (25). IL-4 also induces c-Myc activity in human 
macrophages (26), which controls genes of M2 activation (Scarb1, 
Alox15, and Mrc1) as well as STAT6 and PPARγ activation (26).
TLR engagement leads to NF-κB activation and production of 
inflammatory mediators (27) associated with M1 macrophages. 
However, NF-κB activation also activates a genetic program essen-
tial for resolution of inflammation (28) and for M2 polarization of 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) (29). Moreover, induction of 
p50 NF-κB homodimers is essential for M2 polarization in vitro and 
in vivo (30). The hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α are 
expressed differentially in M1- and M2-polarized macrophages (31) 
and regulate inducible NOS2 (M1) and arginase 1 (M2), respectively.
Figure 1
Mechanisms of macrophage polarization. The major pathways of macrophage polarization are outlined. The crosstalk between the M1-M2 macro-
phage–polarizing pathways is also indicated. The balance between activation of STAT1 and STAT3/STAT6 finely regulates macrophage polariza-
tion and activity. A predominance of NF-κB and STAT1 activation promotes M1 macrophage polarization, resulting in cytotoxic and inflammatory 
functions. In contrast, a predominance of STAT3 and STAT6 activation results in M2 macrophage polarization, associated with immune suppres-
sion and tumor progression. PPARγ and PPARδ control distinct aspects of M2 macrophage activation and oxidative metabolism. KLF4 and KLF2 
participate in the promotion of M2 macrophage functions by cooperating with STAT6 and suppressing the NF-κB/HIF-1α–dependent transcription, 
respectively. IL-4–induced c-Myc activity controls a subset of M2-associated genes. IL-4 also induces the M2-polarizing Jmjd3-IRF4 axis to inhibit 
IRF5-mediated M1 polarization. IL-10 promotes M2 polarization through the induction of p50 NF-κB homodimer, c-Maf, and STAT3 activities.

Epigenetic changes and noncoding RNAs also participate 
in directing macrophage polarization (32–34). IL-4 induces 
upregulation of the histone demethylase JMJD3 in mouse macro-
phages, which alters chromatin modifications to promote expres-
sion of M2 genes and inhibit M1 genes. miR-155 was recently iden-
tified as targeting the IL-13Rα1 subunit, thus decreasing a set of 
M2 genes in human macrophages (35).
Pathology
Resolution of inflammation and repair. Remodeling and repair occur 
dynamically during ontogenesis and inflammation, and these pro-
cesses are orchestrated by macrophages.
Macrophages undergo dynamic changes during different phases 
of wound healing. M1-polarized macrophages mediate tissue dam-
age and initiate inflammatory responses (1, 2). During the early 
stages of the repair response after wounding the skin, infiltrating 
macrophages have an M2 phenotype and their depletion inhibits 
the formation of a highly vascularized, cellular granulation tissue 
and of scar tissues (36). Under these conditions, the removal of 
apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) (37, 38) and the presence of TGF-β  
(39) may skew macrophage function, though demonstration of 
actual in vivo relevance of these findings is lacking.
In a peritoneal model of inflammation, resolution phase macro-
phages expressed a unique mixed M1-M2 phenotype, and cAMP 
was essential to restrain M1 activation (40). In humans, chronic 
venous ulcers (CVU) represent a failure to resolve a chronic inflam-
matory condition (41). Correlative analysis in patients and a 
mouse model suggested that in CVU the infiltrating macrophages 
fail to switch from an M1 to an M2 phenotype (41). Notably, iron 
metabolism is differentially regulated in polarized macrophages 
(42). In CVU, the iron overload in macrophages sustained their M1 
activation, leading to ROS-mediated DNA damage, fibroblast cel-
lular senescence, and defective tissue repair (41). It is tempting to 
speculate that similar mechanisms may underlie M2 functions in 
patients with severe burns, where hemorrhage and tissue damage, 
along with the high release of iron by M2 macrophages (42), may 
result in high iron tissue levels (43).
Dynamic changes in the phenotype of recruited mononuclear 
phagocytes have been observed in models of ischemic heart disease 
(44), suggesting that this is a general feature of the natural history of 
repair processes. In a murine model of hind limb ischemia, haplode-
ficiency of the oxygen sensor prolyl-hydroxylase PHD2 induced the 
canonical NF-κB pathway in macrophages, which promoted their 
M2 polarization and proarteriogenic phenotype (45). This obser-
vation may suggest a functional link between oxygen deprivation, 
as occurring in wounds and tumors, and progressive induction of 
proarteriogenic M2 macrophages. Thus, although the macrophage 
phenotype in resolution need not be a phenocopy of in vitro–gener-
ated M2 cells, preclinical and clinical evidence support the long-held 
view of a key role of polarized macrophages in tissue repair.
In a model of retinal neuropathy, mononuclear phagocyte infil-
tration generates a neuroprotective microenvironment promot-
ing retinal progenitor cell survival (46). The interplay of polarized 
macrophages with stem and progenitor cells is likely a key com-
ponent of their role in repair and remodeling, although the actual 
tissue-protective significance of polarized macrophages in degen-
erative diseases and their involvement with stem and progenitor 
cells remain to be determined (see Supplemental References).
Macrophage activation has been found in autoimmune and 
inflammatory diseases and in particular in lupus nephritis 
(47). In a murine model of SLE, proinflammatory activation 
of macrophages was sustained by Notch signaling (48). Con-
versely, the acute phase protein serum amyloid P (SAP) skewed 
macrophages toward an antiinflammatory M2-like phenotype, 
thus alleviating lupus nephritis (49). In RA, a major source of 
M1 cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-12p70) (50) in the joints are 
the synovial macrophages, whose number correlate with the 
inflammatory disease activity (51). On this basis, PPARδ and 
PPARγ are considered potential disease-modifying drugs for RA 
(52, 53). In a murine model of experimental colitis, recruitment 
of CCL11-expressing Ly6ChiCCR2+ inflammatory monocytes 
into the colon correlates with eosinophil infiltration and his-
topathology (54).
Infection
Bacteria. M1 macrophages are generally considered responsible for 
resistance against intracellular pathogens and characterize infec-
tion with Listeria monocytogenes (55), Salmonella typhi, and Salmo-
nella typhimurium (56), as well as the early phases of infection with 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (57), Mycobacterium ulcerans, and Myco-
bacterium avium (58, 59). Uncontrolled M1 inflammation associ-
ated with acute infections with E. coli or Streptococcus sp. causes 
gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, neonatal meningitis, and 
sepsis (60). The M1-M2 switch observed during the transition 
from acute to chronic infection may provide protection against 
overwhelming uncontrolled inflammation; however, a phenotype 
switch can also favor pathogens that have evolved strategies to 
interfere with M1-associated killing (58, 61–64).
Chronic inflammation and granuloma formation are char-
acterized by the presence of macrophages with an epithelial 
morphology and by macrophage homotypic fusion with the 
formation of multinucleated giant cells (MNG) (65). IL-4–medi-
ated upregulation of E-cadherin, which engages in intercellular 
homotypic adhesion, is likely to underlie MNG formation. STAT6 
drives expression of E-cadherin and DC transmembrane protein 
(DC-STAMP; ref. 66) during MNG generation. The actual func-
tion and role of MNG remain elusive.
Parasites. In experimental and human parasite infections, macro-
phages generally undergo a dynamic switch toward M2 polariza-
tion (61, 67). The early and late phases of Taenia crassiceps infection 
are characterized by Th1-driven M1 and Th2-driven IL-4–mediat-
ed M2 polarization of macrophages, respectively (11, 68). A simi-
lar M1-M2 switch has been reported during Schistosoma mansoni 
and Trypanosoma congolense infection (69). In the chronic stage of 
T. crassiceps infection, the p50 NF-κB subunit (see above) promotes 
protective M2 macrophage polarization associated with decreased 
parasite burden (30).
The recurrent association of M2 polarization with parasite infec-
tions does not necessarily imply a generalized relevance in patho-
genesis. For instance, lineage-selective ablation of the IL-4α chain 
causes a dramatic increase in susceptibility to S. mansoni, but has 
no discernible effect on Nippostrongylus infection (70).
Viral infections. Polarized activation of macrophages has been 
associated with virus infection (e.g., HIV, Kaposi sarcoma–associ-
ated herpes virus, and others; see Supplemental References), and 
this polarization may be important in containing and limiting 
tissue damage. In particular, during severe respiratory syncytial 
virus–induced (RSV-induced) bronchiolitis, IL-4Rα/STAT6-
dependent M2 macrophage differentiation reduces inflammation 
and epithelial damage in lungs (71).

Allergy
Allergy is driven by Th2 cells and products and is associated with 
M2 polarization of macrophages (72, 73). IL-4–inducible che-
mokines acting on CCR4 (e.g., CCL22) have also been reported 
to promote skewing of macrophage function (74). Evidence now 
indicates that chitin- and arginase-dependent M2 pathways play 
an active role in pathogenesis (75, 76). Asthma is associated with 
tissue remodeling, including collagen deposition and goblet cell 
hyperplasia. IL-4–driven M2 polarization is likely to play a key role 
as an orchestrator of these processes (77).
Allergy represents a paradigm for IL-4/IL-13–driven type 2 
inflammation. However, there is evidence that the inflamma-
some/IL-1/Th17 pathway can also drive allergic inflammation 
(78, 79). Moreover, a Th1-associated cytokine, IL-18, has also 
been implicated in allergic inflammation (80). It is therefore per-
haps not surprising that mixed phenotype macrophages have 
been observed (81).
Cancer
Cancer-related inflammation is characterized by the recruitment 
of cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage to tumor tissues 
(2, 82, 83), which also condition the premetastatic niche, to 
favor secondary localization of cancer. Classically activated M1-
polarized macrophages have the potential to exhibit antitumor 
activity and to elicit tumor tissue disruption (4). At least in some 
models of carcinogenesis in the mouse, progression is associated 
with a phenotype switch from M1 to M2 (84). Th1-driven mac-
rophage activation was found to mediate elimination of senes-
cent hepatocytes, which drive subsequent carcinogenesis (85). 
It is therefore likely that classically activated M1 macrophages 
contribute to the T cell–mediated elimination and equilibrium 
phases during tumor progression (86).
At later stages of progression in mice and humans, TAMs gener-
ally have an M2-like phenotype with low IL-12 expression, high IL-10  
expression, and low tumoricidal activity and promotion of tissue 
remodeling and angiogenesis. TAM infiltration is generally associ-
ated with poor prognosis, as shown in Hodgkin disease, glioma, chol-
angiocarcinoma, and breast carcinoma (87, 88). However, TAMs with 
various functional states can coexist in the same tumor (2, 89). Vari-
ous pathways orchestrate the protumor function of myelomonocytic 
cells, including tumor-derived and host-derived signals (2). Lympho-
cytes are key orchestrators of TAM function (2), but pathways differ 
in tumors originating in different organs. For instance, skewing of 
macrophage function was found to be mediated by IL-4–producing 
Th2 cells in skin (90, 91) and by antibody-producing B cells in breast 
carcinogenesis (92, 93). B1 cells can promote cancer progression in 
the skin (5), and fibroblasts can also contribute to circuits driving 
macrophage polarization and tumor promotion (94).
Tumor cell products, including extracellular matrix compo-
nents, IL-10, CSF-1, and chemokines (CCL2, CCL18, CCL17, and 
CXCL4), set macrophages in an M2-like, cancer-promoting mode 
(82, 95–97). TAMs can also interact with and promote the tumori-
genicity of cancer stem cells (CSCs) via production of the milk-fat 
globule-epidermal growth factor–VIII (MFG-E8) by activation of 
the STAT3 and sonic hedgehog pathways (98).
The identification of the various cellular and molecular path-
ways that participate in inflammation in different human cancers 
will be required to translate our understanding of cancer-related 
inflammation to meaningful therapeutic advances.
Obesity and metabolism
Obesity-associated insulin resistance, diabetes, and metabolic 
syndrome are sustained by chronic subclinical inflammation 
(99). Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are a major component

of adipose tissue and are important players in obesity-associated 
pathology. In obese subjects and mice, adipocytes release media-
tors such as CCL2, TNF, or free fatty acids, which promote the 
recruitment and activation of ATMs (100–102). In turn, ATM-pro-
duced inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF, IL-6, IL-1β) counteract 
the insulin-sensitizing action of adiponectin and leptin, leading to 
insulin resistance. ATM infiltration correlates with the degree of 
obesity (101–103). ATM accumulation is orchestrated by selected 
chemokines and their receptors (e.g., CCL2/CCR2 or CCL5/CCR5) 
(101, 103, 104) and by the macrophage-derived apoptosis inhibitor 
of macrophages (AIM) (105).
ATMs from obese mice and humans are polarized toward an 
M1 phenotype, with upregulation of TNF and iNOS. In con-
trast “lean” ATMs express high levels of M2 genes, including 
IL-10, Ym1, and Arginase 1 (106, 107). Weight loss is associ-
ated with a shift back to an M2-like phenotype. However, evi-
dence indicates that the ATM population in obese patients is 
diverse, with a minor F4/80+CD11b+CD11c–, IL-10hi, M2-like 
population coexisting with M1 cells (106). Moreover, analysis 
of CD11c+ ATMs from obese mice revealed a mixed profile of 
several M1-M2 gene transcripts (108). Weight loss is associ-
ated with an increase in F4/80+CD11c–CD301+ M2-like macro-
phages, which promote lipolysis (109).
Progress has been made in defining the molecular pathways that 
account for polarization of ATMs (19, 20, 24, 110, 111) in obesity. 
Mice with macrophage-selective genetic inactivation of PPARγ, 
PPARδ, and KLF4 show inhibition of obesity-induced insulin 
resistance (19, 20, 24, 106, 110), although these results may be 
strain specific (112). The adipose tissue of obese subjects shows a 
marked reduction in KLF4 levels. Nguyen et al. have recently dem-
onstrated that adaptation to lower temperatures (thermogenesis) 
is associated with polarization of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and 
white adipose tissue (WAT) macrophages to the alternative state 
(M2), with increased expression of thermogenic genes (Ppargc1 
and Ucp1) (113). In response to cold, IL-4–driven M2 macrophages 
release noradrenaline in BAT and WAT, which coordinates fatty 
acid mobilization and energy expenditure (113). Although further 
work is needed to dissect the diversity and dynamics of ATMs,  
M2-like cells in nonobese individuals are likely involved in main-
taining adipose tissue homeostasis, preventing inflammation, and 
promoting insulin sensitivity. In contrast, M1-like ATMs drive 
obesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance (107). The 
role of macrophages in obesity and associated disorders underlines 
a homeostatic function of macrophages in metabolism as cells 
capable of reorienting their own metabolic activity and as orches-
trators of general metabolism.

Therapeutic targets in polarized inflammation
Specific macrophage-targeted therapies are now taking the first 
steps into the clinical arena (Table 1). In addition, therapeutic 
approaches not originally designed as macrophage oriented or spe-
cific have been found to affect macrophage activation and polar-
ization. These off-target examples provide insights and lessons for 
the development of more specifically directed approaches.
Recruitment is a key determinant sustaining macrophage 
numbers at sites of inflammation and immunity. Monocyte 
attractants include members of the chemokine superfamily, 
CCL2/MCP-1 in particular, and growth factors interacting with 
tyrosine kinase receptors CSF-1 and VEGF (83, 114, 115). CSF-1 
receptor (c-fms) kinase inhibitors have been generated, and these 
molecules exhibit antiangiogenic and antimetastatic activity in 
acute myeloid leukemia and melanoma models (116, 117). Che-
mokines and CSF-1 are more than monocyte attractants; they 
also promote M2-like skewing of macrophage function (97, 
118, 119). Antibodies directed against CCL2/CCR2 have proven 
active in prostate and breast cancer (83, 120). A CCL2 inhibitor 
(bindarit) has proven active in preclinical models of cancer and 
vascular pathology, resulting in inhibition of monocyte recruit-
ment (121); this agent is now undergoing evaluation for clinical 
use. Anti–CSF-1 antibodies and antisense oligonucleotides sup-
press macrophage infiltration and xenograft mammary tumor 
growth in mice (122–124). VEGF inhibitors can decrease macro-
phage recruitment, and this effect may contribute to their anti-
angiogenic activity (125). In contrast, in response to neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, altered composition in the immune microenvi-
ronment was found in breast cancer patients, with increased per-
centage of infiltrating myeloid cells (126).
Recent results suggest that in situ, proliferation is a key deter-
minant of macrophage accumulation during inflammation in 
the peritoneum and lungs (127, 128). In the latter, IL-4 was found 
to sustain macrophage proliferation. If proliferation is indeed a 
major general mechanism sustaining macrophage accumulation, 
this may suggest novel approaches to reduce macrophage numbers 
in situ and a different perspective for anti–CSF-1/CSF-1R strate-
gies. However, determining the actual significance of macrophage 
proliferation in humans, in particular in Th2-mediated inflamma-
tion, is a major stumbling block in this perspective.
Reorienting and reshaping deranged macrophage polarization 
is the holy grail of macrophage therapeutic targeting (129). Polar-
ized phenotypes are reversible in vitro and in vivo (29, 130–132). 
In proof of concept and in a large clinical study in ovarian cancer 
patients, IFN-γ was found to activate TAM tumoricidal activity, 
inducing a phenotype switch with unequivocal evidence of clinical 
responses (133). In a model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 
CD40 agonist antibodies promoted a remarkable antitumor effect 
and induced high expression of M1 markers (MHC class II and 
CD86) in macrophages (132).
Modulation of macrophage function is an off-target effect for 
a number of diverse therapeutic agents. PPARγ agonists (thia-
zolidinediones) have long been used in the treatment of diabetes. 
The evidence linking PPARγ to M2 polarization and hence to the 
homeostatic role of ATMs sheds fresh new light on their mode 
of action. Preclinical evidence suggests that PPARγ promotes  
M2-like polarization and homeostatic metabolic function in ATMs 
and that alteration of this function is a key pathogenic feature in 
diabetes (134–136). Other therapeutic strategies that have been 
reported to affect macrophage polarization include zoledronic 
acid (an agent used for preventing recurrence of breast cancer bone 
metastasis), statins (137), trabectedin (138) and TLR ligands (e.g., 
imiquimod and CpG) (see also Supplemental References).
Concluding remarks
Progress has been made in defining the molecular networks 
underlying polarized activation of macrophages. Molecular 
determinants of M1 versus M2 polarization include members 
of the PPAR, KLF, IRF, STAT, NF-κB, and HIF families. Regu-
lation of skewing also involves epigenetic modifications with 
involvement of histone methylation and acetylation. miRNAs 
have emerged as regulators of phagocyte activation and function 
(34, 139), but their role in macrophage polarization needs to be 
further defined.
Functional polarization has now been observed in vivo under 
physiological and pathological conditions. The former include 
embryogenesis and pregnancy and normal maintenance of select-
ed tissues, such as testis and adipose. The latter include chronic 
inflammation and tissue repair, metabolic and vascular disorders, 
infection, and cancer. There is now evidence that macrophages are 
a key component of all of these processes (Figure 2).
Under condition such as parasite infections, allergy, and many 
cancers, the functional phenotypes of macrophages in vivo mirror 
those of canonical M1-M2 or M2-like polarized states as defined 
in vitro. However, in a number of pathological conditions, such as 
neurodegenerative disorders (140), this is not the case, and macro-
phage populations express mixed or unique phenotypes. The con-
tribution of coexisting cells with different phenotypes, the impact 
of dynamic changes during disease evolution, and the molecular 
networks orchestrating these mixed phenotypes need to be carefully 
dissected on a case-by-case basis. Indeed, this macrophage plasticity 
calls for in-depth analysis in different pathological conditions.
Therapeutic macrophage targeting is in its infancy. Selected 
clinically approved therapeutic strategies, such as use of PPARγ 
inhibitors, statins, zolendronic acid, and preventive activities such 
as weight loss may have an impact on the functional status of 
macrophages; however, the extent to which their effect on mac-
rophages explains their clinical efficacy remains to be defined. 
The identification of mechanisms and molecules associated with 
macrophage plasticity and polarized activation provides a basis for 
macrophage-centered diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
