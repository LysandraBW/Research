Introduction
Macrophages are an essential component of innate immunity and 
play a central role in inflammation and host defense (1). More-
over, these cells fulfill homeostatic functions beyond defense, 
including tissue remodeling in ontogenesis and orchestration of 
metabolic functions (1–3).
Cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage are characterized by 
considerable diversity and plasticity. In tissues, mononuclear phago-
cytes respond to environmental cues (e.g., microbial products, dam-
aged cells, activated lymphocytes) with the acquisition of distinct 
functional phenotypes. In response to various signals, macrophages 
may undergo classical M1 activation (stimulated by TLR ligands and 
IFN-γ) or alternative M2 activation (stimulated by IL-4/IL-13); these 
states mirror the Th1–Th2 polarization of T cells (2, 4).
The M1 phenotype is characterized by the expression of high 
levels of proinflammatory cytokines, high production of reactive 
nitrogen and oxygen intermediates, promotion of Th1 response, 
and strong microbicidal and tumoricidal activity. In contrast, M2 
macrophages are considered to be involved in parasite containment 
and promotion of tissue remodeling and tumor progression and to 
have immunoregulatory functions. They are characterized by effi-
cient phagocytic activity, high expression of scavenging molecules, 
the expression of mannose and galactose receptors, production of 
ornithine and polyamines through the arginase pathway, and an 
IL-12loIL-10hiIL-1decoyRhiIL-1RAhi phenotype (1, 4). M1-M2 mac-
rophages also are distinct in their chemokine expression profiles.
Signals including IL-10, glucocorticoid hormones, molecules 
released from apoptotic cells, and immune complexes also pro-
foundly affect monocyte-macrophage function. These signals induce 
expression of functional phenotypes that share selected properties 
with M2 cells (e.g., high mannose and scavenger receptor expression), 
but are distinct from them, for instance, in terms of the chemokine 
repertoire. Operationally, we refer to these cells as M2 like (5).
Plasticity and flexibility are key features of mononuclear 
phagocytes and of their activation states (2, 4, 6). The pheno-
type of polarized M1-M2 macrophages can, to some extent, be 
reversed in vitro and in vivo (7, 8). Moreover, pathology is fre-
quently associated with dynamic changes in macrophage activa-
tion, with classically activated M1 cells implicated in initiating 
and sustaining inflammation and M2 or M2-like cells associ-
ated with resolution or smoldering chronic inflammation (9). 
It remains unclear whether the mechanism of these switches 
involves the recruitment of circulating precursors or the reeduca-
tion of cells in situ. However, it is now apparent that specialized 
or polarized T cells (Th1, Th2, Tregs) that are key orchestrators 
of macrophage polarized activation (2) also exhibit previously 
unsuspected flexibility and plasticity (10).
Here, we will focus on recent progress in understanding the 
molecular basis underlying macrophage polarization, including 
signaling pathways, transcription factors, and epigenetic regula-
tion. Moreover, the dynamics and limitations in our understand-
ing of polarized macrophage activation in vivo will be discussed, 
focusing on selected pathological conditions (for references to 
pathology not discussed here, see Supplemental References; sup-
plemental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/
JCI59643DS1). Previous reviews also provide a framework for 
this work (1–3, 6, 11).
Molecular determinants of macrophage polarization
A network of signaling molecules, transcription factors, epigenetic 
mechanisms, and posttranscriptional regulators underlies the dif-
ferent forms of macrophage activation. Canonical IRF/STAT sig-
naling pathways are activated by IFNs and TLR signaling to skew 
macrophage function toward the M1 phenotype (via STAT1) or by 
IL-4 and IL-13 to skew toward the M2 phenotype (via STAT6) (3). 
M1 macrophages upregulate IRF5, which is essential for induction 
of cytokines (IL-12, IL-23, TNF) involved in eliciting Th1 and Th17 
responses (12). The IL-4 type I and type II receptors (1, 13) acti-
vate Stat6, which in turn activates transcription of genes typical 
of M2 polarization, e.g., mannose receptor (Mrc1), resistin-like α

Diversity and plasticity are hallmarks of cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. In response to 
IFNs, Toll-like receptor engagement, or IL-4/IL-13 signaling, macrophages undergo M1 (classical) 
or M2 (alternative) activation, which represent extremes of a continuum in a universe of activation 
states. Progress has now been made in defining the signaling pathways, transcriptional networks, 
and epigenetic mechanisms underlying M1-M2 or M2-like polarized activation. Functional skew-
ing of mononuclear phagocytes occurs in vivo under physiological conditions (e.g., ontogenesis 
and pregnancy) and in pathology (allergic and chronic inflammation, tissue repair, infection, and 
cancer). However, in selected preclinical and clinical conditions, coexistence of cells in different activation states 
and unique or mixed phenotypes have been observed, a reflection of dynamic changes and complex tissue-derived 
signals. The identification of mechanisms and molecules associated with macrophage plasticity and polarized acti-
vation provides a basis for macrophage-centered diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

(Retnla, Fizz1), and chitinase 3–like 3 (Chi3l3, Ym1) (14). IL-10 acti-
vates STAT3-mediated expression of genes (Il10, Tgfb1, Mrc1) asso-
ciated with an M2-like phenotype (4, 15, 16).
STAT-mediated activation of macrophages is regulated by mem-
bers of the SOCS family. IL-4 and IFN-γ, the latter in concert with 
TLR stimulation, upregulate SOCS1 and SOCS3, which in turn 
inhibit the action of STAT1 and STAT3, respectively (17, 18).
Downstream of, or in parallel with, the IRF/STAT/SOCS pathway, 
a panel of transcription factors orchestrates polarized macrophage 
activation. The nuclear receptors PPARγ (19) and PPARδ (20, 21) con-
trol distinct subsets of genes associated with M2 macrophage activa-
tion and oxidative metabolism (Figure 1). Interestingly, STAT6 coor-
dinates and synergizes with both PPARγ (22) and Krüppel-like factor 4  
(KLF4), a member of a family of proteins that contribute to macro-
phage function (23, 24). KLF4 cooperates with Stat6 to induce M2 
genes (Arg-1, Mrc1, Fizz1, PPARγ) and inhibit M1 genes (TNFa, Cox-2,  
CCL5, iNOS) via sequestration of coactivators required for NF-κB acti-
vation. KLF2 regulates macrophage activation by inhibiting NF-κB/ 
HIF-1α activities (25). IL-4 also induces c-Myc activity in human 
macrophages (26), which controls genes of M2 activation (Scarb1, 
Alox15, and Mrc1) as well as STAT6 and PPARγ activation (26).
TLR engagement leads to NF-κB activation and production of 
inflammatory mediators (27) associated with M1 macrophages. 
However, NF-κB activation also activates a genetic program essen-
tial for resolution of inflammation (28) and for M2 polarization of 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) (29). Moreover, induction of 
p50 NF-κB homodimers is essential for M2 polarization in vitro and 
in vivo (30). The hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α are 
expressed differentially in M1- and M2-polarized macrophages (31) 
and regulate inducible NOS2 (M1) and arginase 1 (M2), respectively.
Figure 1
Mechanisms of macrophage polarization. The major pathways of macrophage polarization are outlined. The crosstalk between the M1-M2 macro-
phage–polarizing pathways is also indicated. The balance between activation of STAT1 and STAT3/STAT6 finely regulates macrophage polariza-
tion and activity. A predominance of NF-κB and STAT1 activation promotes M1 macrophage polarization, resulting in cytotoxic and inflammatory 
functions. In contrast, a predominance of STAT3 and STAT6 activation results in M2 macrophage polarization, associated with immune suppres-
sion and tumor progression. PPARγ and PPARδ control distinct aspects of M2 macrophage activation and oxidative metabolism. KLF4 and KLF2 
participate in the promotion of M2 macrophage functions by cooperating with STAT6 and suppressing the NF-κB/HIF-1α–dependent transcription, 
respectively. IL-4–induced c-Myc activity controls a subset of M2-associated genes. IL-4 also induces the M2-polarizing Jmjd3-IRF4 axis to inhibit 
IRF5-mediated M1 polarization. IL-10 promotes M2 polarization through the induction of p50 NF-κB homodimer, c-Maf, and STAT3 activities.

Epigenetic changes and noncoding RNAs also participate 
in directing macrophage polarization (32–34). IL-4 induces 
upregulation of the histone demethylase JMJD3 in mouse macro-
phages, which alters chromatin modifications to promote expres-
sion of M2 genes and inhibit M1 genes. miR-155 was recently iden-
tified as targeting the IL-13Rα1 subunit, thus decreasing a set of 
M2 genes in human macrophages (35).
Pathology
Resolution of inflammation and repair. Remodeling and repair occur 
dynamically during ontogenesis and inflammation, and these pro-
cesses are orchestrated by macrophages.
Macrophages undergo dynamic changes during different phases 
of wound healing. M1-polarized macrophages mediate tissue dam-
age and initiate inflammatory responses (1, 2). During the early 
stages of the repair response after wounding the skin, infiltrating 
macrophages have an M2 phenotype and their depletion inhibits 
the formation of a highly vascularized, cellular granulation tissue 
and of scar tissues (36). Under these conditions, the removal of 
apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) (37, 38) and the presence of TGF-β  
(39) may skew macrophage function, though demonstration of 
actual in vivo relevance of these findings is lacking.
In a peritoneal model of inflammation, resolution phase macro-
phages expressed a unique mixed M1-M2 phenotype, and cAMP 
was essential to restrain M1 activation (40). In humans, chronic 
venous ulcers (CVU) represent a failure to resolve a chronic inflam-
matory condition (41). Correlative analysis in patients and a 
mouse model suggested that in CVU the infiltrating macrophages 
fail to switch from an M1 to an M2 phenotype (41). Notably, iron 
metabolism is differentially regulated in polarized macrophages 
(42). In CVU, the iron overload in macrophages sustained their M1 
activation, leading to ROS-mediated DNA damage, fibroblast cel-
lular senescence, and defective tissue repair (41). It is tempting to 
speculate that similar mechanisms may underlie M2 functions in 
patients with severe burns, where hemorrhage and tissue damage, 
along with the high release of iron by M2 macrophages (42), may 
result in high iron tissue levels (43).
Dynamic changes in the phenotype of recruited mononuclear 
phagocytes have been observed in models of ischemic heart disease 
(44), suggesting that this is a general feature of the natural history of 
repair processes. In a murine model of hind limb ischemia, haplode-
ficiency of the oxygen sensor prolyl-hydroxylase PHD2 induced the 
canonical NF-κB pathway in macrophages, which promoted their 
M2 polarization and proarteriogenic phenotype (45). This obser-
vation may suggest a functional link between oxygen deprivation, 
as occurring in wounds and tumors, and progressive induction of 
proarteriogenic M2 macrophages. Thus, although the macrophage 
phenotype in resolution need not be a phenocopy of in vitro–gener-
ated M2 cells, preclinical and clinical evidence support the long-held 
view of a key role of polarized macrophages in tissue repair.
In a model of retinal neuropathy, mononuclear phagocyte infil-
tration generates a neuroprotective microenvironment promot-
ing retinal progenitor cell survival (46). The interplay of polarized 
macrophages with stem and progenitor cells is likely a key com-
ponent of their role in repair and remodeling, although the actual 
tissue-protective significance of polarized macrophages in degen-
erative diseases and their involvement with stem and progenitor 
cells remain to be determined (see Supplemental References).
Macrophage activation has been found in autoimmune and 
inflammatory diseases and in particular in lupus nephritis 
(47). In a murine model of SLE, proinflammatory activation 
of macrophages was sustained by Notch signaling (48). Con-
versely, the acute phase protein serum amyloid P (SAP) skewed 
macrophages toward an antiinflammatory M2-like phenotype, 
thus alleviating lupus nephritis (49). In RA, a major source of 
M1 cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-12p70) (50) in the joints are 
the synovial macrophages, whose number correlate with the 
inflammatory disease activity (51). On this basis, PPARδ and 
PPARγ are considered potential disease-modifying drugs for RA 
(52, 53). In a murine model of experimental colitis, recruitment 
of CCL11-expressing Ly6ChiCCR2+ inflammatory monocytes 
into the colon correlates with eosinophil infiltration and his-
topathology (54).
Infection
Bacteria. M1 macrophages are generally considered responsible for 
resistance against intracellular pathogens and characterize infec-
tion with Listeria monocytogenes (55), Salmonella typhi, and Salmo-
nella typhimurium (56), as well as the early phases of infection with 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (57), Mycobacterium ulcerans, and Myco-
bacterium avium (58, 59). Uncontrolled M1 inflammation associ-
ated with acute infections with E. coli or Streptococcus sp. causes 
gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, neonatal meningitis, and 
sepsis (60). The M1-M2 switch observed during the transition 
from acute to chronic infection may provide protection against 
overwhelming uncontrolled inflammation; however, a phenotype 
switch can also favor pathogens that have evolved strategies to 
interfere with M1-associated killing (58, 61–64).
Chronic inflammation and granuloma formation are char-
acterized by the presence of macrophages with an epithelial 
morphology and by macrophage homotypic fusion with the 
formation of multinucleated giant cells (MNG) (65). IL-4–medi-
ated upregulation of E-cadherin, which engages in intercellular 
homotypic adhesion, is likely to underlie MNG formation. STAT6 
drives expression of E-cadherin and DC transmembrane protein 
(DC-STAMP; ref. 66) during MNG generation. The actual func-
tion and role of MNG remain elusive.
Parasites. In experimental and human parasite infections, macro-
phages generally undergo a dynamic switch toward M2 polariza-
tion (61, 67). The early and late phases of Taenia crassiceps infection 
are characterized by Th1-driven M1 and Th2-driven IL-4–mediat-
ed M2 polarization of macrophages, respectively (11, 68). A simi-
lar M1-M2 switch has been reported during Schistosoma mansoni 
and Trypanosoma congolense infection (69). In the chronic stage of 
T. crassiceps infection, the p50 NF-κB subunit (see above) promotes 
protective M2 macrophage polarization associated with decreased 
parasite burden (30).
The recurrent association of M2 polarization with parasite infec-
tions does not necessarily imply a generalized relevance in patho-
genesis. For instance, lineage-selective ablation of the IL-4α chain 
causes a dramatic increase in susceptibility to S. mansoni, but has 
no discernible effect on Nippostrongylus infection (70).
Viral infections. Polarized activation of macrophages has been 
associated with virus infection (e.g., HIV, Kaposi sarcoma–associ-
ated herpes virus, and others; see Supplemental References), and 
this polarization may be important in containing and limiting 
tissue damage. In particular, during severe respiratory syncytial 
virus–induced (RSV-induced) bronchiolitis, IL-4Rα/STAT6-
dependent M2 macrophage differentiation reduces inflammation 
and epithelial damage in lungs (71).

Allergy
Allergy is driven by Th2 cells and products and is associated with 
M2 polarization of macrophages (72, 73). IL-4–inducible che-
mokines acting on CCR4 (e.g., CCL22) have also been reported 
to promote skewing of macrophage function (74). Evidence now 
indicates that chitin- and arginase-dependent M2 pathways play 
an active role in pathogenesis (75, 76). Asthma is associated with 
tissue remodeling, including collagen deposition and goblet cell 
hyperplasia. IL-4–driven M2 polarization is likely to play a key role 
as an orchestrator of these processes (77).
Allergy represents a paradigm for IL-4/IL-13–driven type 2 
inflammation. However, there is evidence that the inflamma-
some/IL-1/Th17 pathway can also drive allergic inflammation 
(78, 79). Moreover, a Th1-associated cytokine, IL-18, has also 
been implicated in allergic inflammation (80). It is therefore per-
haps not surprising that mixed phenotype macrophages have 
been observed (81).
Cancer
Cancer-related inflammation is characterized by the recruitment 
of cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage to tumor tissues 
(2, 82, 83), which also condition the premetastatic niche, to 
favor secondary localization of cancer. Classically activated M1-
polarized macrophages have the potential to exhibit antitumor 
activity and to elicit tumor tissue disruption (4). At least in some 
models of carcinogenesis in the mouse, progression is associated 
with a phenotype switch from M1 to M2 (84). Th1-driven mac-
rophage activation was found to mediate elimination of senes-
cent hepatocytes, which drive subsequent carcinogenesis (85). 
It is therefore likely that classically activated M1 macrophages 
contribute to the T cell–mediated elimination and equilibrium 
phases during tumor progression (86).
At later stages of progression in mice and humans, TAMs gener-
ally have an M2-like phenotype with low IL-12 expression, high IL-10  
expression, and low tumoricidal activity and promotion of tissue 
remodeling and angiogenesis. TAM infiltration is generally associ-
ated with poor prognosis, as shown in Hodgkin disease, glioma, chol-
angiocarcinoma, and breast carcinoma (87, 88). However, TAMs with 
various functional states can coexist in the same tumor (2, 89). Vari-
ous pathways orchestrate the protumor function of myelomonocytic 
cells, including tumor-derived and host-derived signals (2). Lympho-
cytes are key orchestrators of TAM function (2), but pathways differ 
in tumors originating in different organs. For instance, skewing of 
macrophage function was found to be mediated by IL-4–producing 
Th2 cells in skin (90, 91) and by antibody-producing B cells in breast 
carcinogenesis (92, 93). B1 cells can promote cancer progression in 
the skin (5), and fibroblasts can also contribute to circuits driving 
macrophage polarization and tumor promotion (94).
Tumor cell products, including extracellular matrix compo-
nents, IL-10, CSF-1, and chemokines (CCL2, CCL18, CCL17, and 
CXCL4), set macrophages in an M2-like, cancer-promoting mode 
(82, 95–97). TAMs can also interact with and promote the tumori-
genicity of cancer stem cells (CSCs) via production of the milk-fat 
globule-epidermal growth factor–VIII (MFG-E8) by activation of 
the STAT3 and sonic hedgehog pathways (98).
The identification of the various cellular and molecular path-
ways that participate in inflammation in different human cancers 
will be required to translate our understanding of cancer-related 
inflammation to meaningful therapeutic advances.
Obesity and metabolism
Obesity-associated insulin resistance, diabetes, and metabolic 
syndrome are sustained by chronic subclinical inflammation 
(99). Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are a major component

of adipose tissue and are important players in obesity-associated 
pathology. In obese subjects and mice, adipocytes release media-
tors such as CCL2, TNF, or free fatty acids, which promote the 
recruitment and activation of ATMs (100–102). In turn, ATM-pro-
duced inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF, IL-6, IL-1β) counteract 
the insulin-sensitizing action of adiponectin and leptin, leading to 
insulin resistance. ATM infiltration correlates with the degree of 
obesity (101–103). ATM accumulation is orchestrated by selected 
chemokines and their receptors (e.g., CCL2/CCR2 or CCL5/CCR5) 
(101, 103, 104) and by the macrophage-derived apoptosis inhibitor 
of macrophages (AIM) (105).
ATMs from obese mice and humans are polarized toward an 
M1 phenotype, with upregulation of TNF and iNOS. In con-
trast “lean” ATMs express high levels of M2 genes, including 
IL-10, Ym1, and Arginase 1 (106, 107). Weight loss is associ-
ated with a shift back to an M2-like phenotype. However, evi-
dence indicates that the ATM population in obese patients is 
diverse, with a minor F4/80+CD11b+CD11c–, IL-10hi, M2-like 
population coexisting with M1 cells (106). Moreover, analysis 
of CD11c+ ATMs from obese mice revealed a mixed profile of 
several M1-M2 gene transcripts (108). Weight loss is associ-
ated with an increase in F4/80+CD11c–CD301+ M2-like macro-
phages, which promote lipolysis (109).
Progress has been made in defining the molecular pathways that 
account for polarization of ATMs (19, 20, 24, 110, 111) in obesity. 
Mice with macrophage-selective genetic inactivation of PPARγ, 
PPARδ, and KLF4 show inhibition of obesity-induced insulin 
resistance (19, 20, 24, 106, 110), although these results may be 
strain specific (112). The adipose tissue of obese subjects shows a 
marked reduction in KLF4 levels. Nguyen et al. have recently dem-
onstrated that adaptation to lower temperatures (thermogenesis) 
is associated with polarization of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and 
white adipose tissue (WAT) macrophages to the alternative state 
(M2), with increased expression of thermogenic genes (Ppargc1 
and Ucp1) (113). In response to cold, IL-4–driven M2 macrophages 
release noradrenaline in BAT and WAT, which coordinates fatty 
acid mobilization and energy expenditure (113). Although further 
work is needed to dissect the diversity and dynamics of ATMs,  
M2-like cells in nonobese individuals are likely involved in main-
taining adipose tissue homeostasis, preventing inflammation, and 
promoting insulin sensitivity. In contrast, M1-like ATMs drive 
obesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance (107). The 
role of macrophages in obesity and associated disorders underlines 
a homeostatic function of macrophages in metabolism as cells 
capable of reorienting their own metabolic activity and as orches-
trators of general metabolism.

Therapeutic targets in polarized inflammation
Specific macrophage-targeted therapies are now taking the first 
steps into the clinical arena (Table 1). In addition, therapeutic 
approaches not originally designed as macrophage oriented or spe-
cific have been found to affect macrophage activation and polar-
ization. These off-target examples provide insights and lessons for 
the development of more specifically directed approaches.
Recruitment is a key determinant sustaining macrophage 
numbers at sites of inflammation and immunity. Monocyte 
attractants include members of the chemokine superfamily, 
CCL2/MCP-1 in particular, and growth factors interacting with 
tyrosine kinase receptors CSF-1 and VEGF (83, 114, 115). CSF-1 
receptor (c-fms) kinase inhibitors have been generated, and these 
molecules exhibit antiangiogenic and antimetastatic activity in 
acute myeloid leukemia and melanoma models (116, 117). Che-
mokines and CSF-1 are more than monocyte attractants; they 
also promote M2-like skewing of macrophage function (97, 
118, 119). Antibodies directed against CCL2/CCR2 have proven 
active in prostate and breast cancer (83, 120). A CCL2 inhibitor 
(bindarit) has proven active in preclinical models of cancer and 
vascular pathology, resulting in inhibition of monocyte recruit-
ment (121); this agent is now undergoing evaluation for clinical 
use. Anti–CSF-1 antibodies and antisense oligonucleotides sup-
press macrophage infiltration and xenograft mammary tumor 
growth in mice (122–124). VEGF inhibitors can decrease macro-
phage recruitment, and this effect may contribute to their anti-
angiogenic activity (125). In contrast, in response to neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, altered composition in the immune microenvi-
ronment was found in breast cancer patients, with increased per-
centage of infiltrating myeloid cells (126).
Recent results suggest that in situ, proliferation is a key deter-
minant of macrophage accumulation during inflammation in 
the peritoneum and lungs (127, 128). In the latter, IL-4 was found 
to sustain macrophage proliferation. If proliferation is indeed a 
major general mechanism sustaining macrophage accumulation, 
this may suggest novel approaches to reduce macrophage numbers 
in situ and a different perspective for anti–CSF-1/CSF-1R strate-
gies. However, determining the actual significance of macrophage 
proliferation in humans, in particular in Th2-mediated inflamma-
tion, is a major stumbling block in this perspective.
Reorienting and reshaping deranged macrophage polarization 
is the holy grail of macrophage therapeutic targeting (129). Polar-
ized phenotypes are reversible in vitro and in vivo (29, 130–132). 
In proof of concept and in a large clinical study in ovarian cancer 
patients, IFN-γ was found to activate TAM tumoricidal activity, 
inducing a phenotype switch with unequivocal evidence of clinical 
responses (133). In a model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 
CD40 agonist antibodies promoted a remarkable antitumor effect 
and induced high expression of M1 markers (MHC class II and 
CD86) in macrophages (132).
Modulation of macrophage function is an off-target effect for 
a number of diverse therapeutic agents. PPARγ agonists (thia-
zolidinediones) have long been used in the treatment of diabetes. 
The evidence linking PPARγ to M2 polarization and hence to the 
homeostatic role of ATMs sheds fresh new light on their mode 
of action. Preclinical evidence suggests that PPARγ promotes  
M2-like polarization and homeostatic metabolic function in ATMs 
and that alteration of this function is a key pathogenic feature in 
diabetes (134–136). Other therapeutic strategies that have been 
reported to affect macrophage polarization include zoledronic 
acid (an agent used for preventing recurrence of breast cancer bone 
metastasis), statins (137), trabectedin (138) and TLR ligands (e.g., 
imiquimod and CpG) (see also Supplemental References).
Concluding remarks
Progress has been made in defining the molecular networks 
underlying polarized activation of macrophages. Molecular 
determinants of M1 versus M2 polarization include members 
of the PPAR, KLF, IRF, STAT, NF-κB, and HIF families. Regu-
lation of skewing also involves epigenetic modifications with 
involvement of histone methylation and acetylation. miRNAs 
have emerged as regulators of phagocyte activation and function 
(34, 139), but their role in macrophage polarization needs to be 
further defined.
Functional polarization has now been observed in vivo under 
physiological and pathological conditions. The former include 
embryogenesis and pregnancy and normal maintenance of select-
ed tissues, such as testis and adipose. The latter include chronic 
inflammation and tissue repair, metabolic and vascular disorders, 
infection, and cancer. There is now evidence that macrophages are 
a key component of all of these processes (Figure 2).
Under condition such as parasite infections, allergy, and many 
cancers, the functional phenotypes of macrophages in vivo mirror 
those of canonical M1-M2 or M2-like polarized states as defined 
in vitro. However, in a number of pathological conditions, such as 
neurodegenerative disorders (140), this is not the case, and macro-
phage populations express mixed or unique phenotypes. The con-
tribution of coexisting cells with different phenotypes, the impact 
of dynamic changes during disease evolution, and the molecular 
networks orchestrating these mixed phenotypes need to be carefully 
dissected on a case-by-case basis. Indeed, this macrophage plasticity 
calls for in-depth analysis in different pathological conditions.
Therapeutic macrophage targeting is in its infancy. Selected 
clinically approved therapeutic strategies, such as use of PPARγ 
inhibitors, statins, zolendronic acid, and preventive activities such 
as weight loss may have an impact on the functional status of 
macrophages; however, the extent to which their effect on mac-
rophages explains their clinical efficacy remains to be defined. 
The identification of mechanisms and molecules associated with 
macrophage plasticity and polarized activation provides a basis for 
macrophage-centered diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

Experiences, whether they be learning in a classroom, a stressful event, or ingestion of a psychoactive substance, impact the
brain by modifying the activity and organization of specific neural circuitry. A major mechanism by which the neural activity
generated by an experience modifies brain function is via modifications of synaptic transmission; that is, synaptic plasticity.
Here, we review current understanding of the mechanisms of the major forms of synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses in
the mammalian brain. We also provide examples of the possible developmental and behavioral functions of synaptic plasticity
and how maladaptive synaptic plasticity may contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders.

INTRODUCTION
One of the most important and fascinating properties of the
mammalian brain is its plasticity; the capacity of the neural
activity generated by an experience to modify neural circuit
function and thereby modify subsequent thoughts, feelings,
and behavior. Synaptic plasticity specifically refers to the
activity-dependent modification of the strength or efficacy
of synaptic transmission at preexisting synapses, and for
over a century has been proposed to play a central role in
the capacity of the brain to incorporate transient experi-
ences into persistent memory traces. Synaptic plasticity is
also thought to play key roles in the early development of
neural circuitry and evidence is accumulating that impair-
ments in synaptic plasticity mechanisms contribute to
several prominent neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, eluci-
dating the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying
synaptic plasticity in any number of different brain regions
is critical for understanding the neural basis of many
aspects of normal and pathological brain function.
Given the diversity of the functions ascribed to synaptic
plasticity, it is not surprising that many forms and
mechanisms of synaptic plasticity have been described.
Synaptic transmission can be either enhanced or depressed
by activity, and these changes span temporal domains
ranging from milliseconds to hours, days, and presumably
even longer. Furthermore, virtually all excitatory synapses
in the mammalian brain simultaneously express a number
of different forms of synaptic plasticity. Here, we attempt to
provide a broad overview of the mechanisms of the most
prominent
forms
of
plasticity
observed
at
excitatory
synapses in the mammalian brain. After briefly reviewing
short-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity, we will emphasize
current understanding of the cellular mechanisms and
possible functions of the class of phenomena commonly
termed long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depres-
sion (LTD).
SHORT-TERM SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY
Numerous forms of short-term synaptic plasticity, lasting
on the order of milliseconds to several minutes, have been
observed at virtually every synapse examined in organisms
ranging from simple invertebrates to mammals (Zucker and
Regehr, 2002). These are thought to play important roles in
short-term adaptations to sensory inputs, transient changes
in behavioral states, and short-lasting forms of memory.
Most forms of short-term synaptic plasticity are triggered
by short bursts of activity causing a transient accumulation
of calcium in presynaptic nerve terminals. This increase in
presynaptic
calcium
in
turn
causes
changes
in
the
probability of neurotransmitter release by directly modify-
ing the biochemical processes that underlie the exocytosis
of synaptic vesicles.
Paired-Pulse Facilitation and Depression
When two stimuli are delivered within a short interval, the
response to the second stimulus can be either enhanced or

depressed relative to the response to the first stimulus (Katz
and Miledi, 1968; Zucker and Regehr, 2002). Paired-pulse
depression is commonly observed at all synapses at short
(less than 20 ms) interstimulus intervals, and most probably
results from inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium or
calcium channels or from a transient depletion of the
release-ready pool of vesicles docked at the presynaptic
terminal. Many synapses exhibit paired-pulse facilitation at
longer
interstimulus
intervals
(20–500 ms).
A
simple
explanation for this phenomenon is that the residual
calcium left over from the invasion of the first action
potential contributes to additional release during the second
stimulation, but it is likely that additional mechanisms are
involved. These may involve activation of protein kinases
that modulate the activity of presynaptic phosphoproteins.
For example, mice in which the presynaptic phosphoprotein
synapsin (De Camilli et al, 1990) has been knocked out,
exhibit abnormal short-term plasticity (Rosahl et al, 1993,
1995).
Whether a synapse exhibits paired-pulse facilitation or
depression depends on the recent history of activation of
the synapse. Because these forms of plasticity largely result
from changes in the probability of transmitter release (p),
synapses that begin with a very high p tend to depress their
response to the second pulse (Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997).
In contrast, synapses with a low initial p normally exhibit an
increase in p in response to the second stimulus. Consistent
with this idea, manipulations that decrease p (eg, activation
of presynaptic autoreceptors) almost always cause an
increase in the magnitude of paired-pulse facilitation, or
even a conversion of paired-pulse depression to facilitation.
Thus, the same synapse can display either facilitation or
depression, depending on its recent history of activation
and modulation.
Facilitation and Depression Following Trains of
Stimuli
Longer-lasting forms of plasticity are observed following
repetitive or tetanic stimulation of synapses with prolonged
(approximately 200 ms to 5 s) trains of stimulation applied
at high frequencies (10–200 Hz) (Zucker and Regehr, 2002).
Augmentation and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) describe
an enhancement of transmitter release lasting from seconds
(augmentation) to several minutes (PTP). They also involve
an increase in the probability of transmitter release in
response to an action potential due, in large part, to the
buildup
of
calcium
concentration
in
the
presynaptic
terminal during the stimulus trains. This residual calcium
may combine with the calcium influx elicited by the
subsequent single action potential to enhance directly the
release of neurotransmitter, or may lead to biochemical
modifications of proteins in the presynaptic terminal
(Magleby and Zengel, 1982; Zucker and Regehr, 2002).
At some synapses, repetitive activation leads to depres-
sion that can last for several seconds or even minutes (Betz,
1970; Zucker and Regehr, 2002). As in paired-pulse
depression, this generally occurs in synapses that exhibit a
high probability of release, and is thought to result, at least
in part, from a transient depletion of the release-ready pool
of synaptic vesicles. The decrease in synaptic strength can
also arise from the release of modulatory substances from
the activated presynaptic terminals, postsynaptic cells, or
even neighboring cells, initiating a signaling cascade that
leads to inhibition of the presynaptic release machinery.
Finally, a postsynaptic mechanism of short-term plasticity
may involve desensitization of ligand-gated receptors,
making the target neuron less sensitive to neurotransmitter.
A key characteristic of depression at many synapses is use
dependence. Higher levels of transmission are associated
with larger depression, and reduction of baseline transmis-
sion (eg, by reducing external calcium concentration)
relieves depression.
Modulation of Transmission by Presynaptic
Receptors
Most presynaptic terminals possess a number of different
types of metabotropic G-protein-coupled receptors, as well
as ionotropic receptors (MacDermott et al, 1999). The
probability of transmitter release, a significant factor in
defining synaptic strength, is controlled in part by the
occupancy of these receptors, which in turn is set by the
extracellular concentrations of their agonists. In some cases,
tonic levels of endogenous ligands are sufficient to partially
activate the receptors. Nonetheless, synaptic activity can
further increase receptor occupancy by transiently elevating
the concentration of various presynaptic neuromodulators
(Thompson et al, 1993; Miller, 1998). Depending on their
specific properties, activation of these receptors can either
enhance or depress synaptic transmission.
Via the release of a number of different neuromodulators,
postsynaptic
cells
can
also
influence
the
release
of
transmitter from presynaptic terminals. A common scenar-
io is that in response to strong postsynaptic depolarization,
dendrites release retrograde messengers that act through G-
protein-coupled receptors located on presynaptic terminals
to influence neurotransmitter release. Retrograde messen-
gers that have been identified in specific cell types include
dopamine, dynorphin, glutamate, GABA, nitric oxide,
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and oxytocin
(Drake et al, 1994; Kombian et al, 1997; Llano et al, 1991;
Naggapan and Lu, 2005; Nugent et al, 2007; Pitler and Alger,
1992; Zilberter, 2000; Zilberter et al, 1999). Although
postsynaptic, calcium-dependent fusion of vesicles is one
common mechanism for the release of retrograde messen-
gers, they can also released by non-vesicular mechanisms.
For example, a widespread, extensively studied system for
mediating retrograde synaptic signaling involves the post-
synaptic release of endogenous cannabinoids, such as
anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, which are pro-
duced upon demand by cleavage of phospholipids and are
sensed by CB1 receptors on presynaptic terminals. The
mechanisms of endocannabinoid release are unclear and
may involve a transporter, which facilitates diffusion across
the plasma membrane (Chevaleyre et al, 2006) Such
retrograde signaling by postsynaptic release of endocanna-
binoids can be initiated by strong depolarization or
activation of postsynaptic metabotropic receptors and has
been shown to transiently suppress inhibitory and excita-
tory synapses in several brain regions (Chevaleyre et al,
2006). Importantly, in the striatum, there is a form of LTD
(to be discussed below) that is triggered by the release of
endocannabinoids.

Involvement of Glia in Short-Term Plasticity
There is growing realization that glia may be involved in
some forms of short-term plasticity (Araque et al, 2001;
Haydon,
2001).
With
their
intimate
association
with
synapses, astrocytes and perisynaptic Schwann cells are
well
positioned
to
regulate
synapses.
They
have
an
established role in clearance of neurotransmitter and may
participate in synaptic plasticity by controlling the speed
and extent of such clearance (Bergles et al, 1999; Danbolt,
2001). This can in turn impact on the degree of postsynaptic
receptor activation and desensitization. Another way that
glia may be involved in synaptic plasticity is by sensing
extracellular messengers and then releasing substances that
in turn can directly affect synaptic efficacy (Araque et al,
2001; Haydon, 2001). For example, glia express many
different neurotransmitter receptors (eg, glutamate recep-
tors), which when activated result in the release of
substances (eg, ATP) that can then act on presynaptic
terminals to regulate neurotransmitter release.
Functions of Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity
Short-term synaptic plasticity was originally established as
behaviorally important from studies of simple organisms
such as Aplysia (Kandel and Tauc, 1965). In the mammalian
brain, an important consequence of short-term synaptic
plasticity
is
to
influence
the
information
processing
function of synapses, enabling them to act as filters with a
wide range of properties. For example, synapses with a low
initial probability of release function as high-pass filters,
since they will facilitate during high-frequency action
potential bursts while low-frequency bursts will not be
transmitted with the same efficacy. In contrast, synapses
with a high initial probability of release function as low-pass
filters, since they will depress during high-frequency bursts
but will reliably relay low-frequency activity (Abbott and
Regehr, 2004). The filtering characteristics of a synapse can
be adjusted through modulation of the initial release
probability. This most commonly occurs due to the release
of neuromodulators that, via activation of presynaptic
receptors, reduce the probability of release. This changes
the filtering characteristics of the synapse, causing facilita-
tion to become predominant over depression. In this way,
presynaptic inhibition can convert a synapse from a low-
pass to a high-pass filter.
LONG-TERM SYNAPTIC PLASTICIY
It is widely believed that experience of any sort modifies
subsequent behavior at least in part through activity-
dependent, long-lasting modifications of synaptic strength.
The brain encodes external and internal events as complex,
spatio-temporal patterns of activity in large ensembles
of neurons that can be conceptualized as ‘neural circuits’.
A key feature defining the behavior of any given neural
circuit is the pattern of synaptic weights that connect
the individual neurons that comprise the circuit. A corollary
to this hypothesis is that new information is stored
(ie, memories are generated) when activity in a circuit
causes a long-lasting change in the pattern of synaptic
weights. This idea was put forward over 100 years ago
by the Spanish Nobel laureate Santiago Ramon y Cajal,
and was further advanced in the late 1940s by Donald
Hebb,
who
proposed
that
associative
memories
are
formed in the brain by a process of synaptic modification
that strengthens connections when presynaptic activity
correlates with postsynaptic firing (Hebb, 1949). This
proposed
function
for
synaptic
plasticity,
forming
a
memory trace following the detection of two coincident
events, suggests an appealing cellular basis for behavioral
phenomena
such
as
Pavlovian
classical
conditioning
(Pavlov, 1927).
Experimental support for the very existence of such
long-lasting,
activity-dependent
changes
in
synaptic
strength was lacking until the early 1970s when Bliss
and colleagues (Bliss and Gardner-Medwin, 1973; Bliss
and Lomo, 1973) reported that repetitive activation of
excitatory synapses in the hippocampus caused a potentia-
tion of synaptic strength that could last for hours or even
days. Over the last three decades, this phenomenon,
eventually termed LTP, has been the object of intense
investigation because it is widely believed that it provides an
important key to understanding some of the cellular and
molecular mechanisms by which memories are formed
(Martin et al, 2000; Pastalkova et al, 2006; Whitlock et al,
2006).
Although still considered prototypic, it is now clear that
hippocampal LTP is only one of several different forms of
long-term synaptic plasticity that exist in specific circuits in
the mammalian brain. Importantly, it is well established
that most synapses that exhibit LTP also express one or
more forms of LTD. Thus, a key concept is that synaptic
strength at excitatory synapses is bidirectionally modifiable
by different patterns of activity. Furthermore, it is now clear
that the terms ‘LTP’ and ‘LTD’ describe a class of
phenomena, the underlying mechanisms of which vary
depending on the circuits in which they function.
Additional forms of synaptic plasticity more recently
identified
include
homeostatic
plasticity
(Turrigiano
and
Nelson,
2004) and
metaplasticity
(Abraham
and
Bear, 1996). The major form of homeostatic plasticity is
‘synaptic scaling’, which describes phenomena whereby
the strength of all synapses on a given cell are adjusted in
response to prolonged changes in activity. Specifically,
prolonged decreases in overall activity cause a net scaling
up of total synaptic strengths while prolonged increases in
activity cause the opposite, a scaling down of synaptic
strengths. This form of plasticity operates on a much
slower timescale than LTP or LTD and may be parti-
cularly
important
during
the
development
of
neural
circuits. Metaplasticity refers to the effects that activity
can have on the capacity of synapses to express long-term
plasticity.
The most extensively studied and therefore prototypic
forms of synaptic plasticity are the LTP and LTD observed
in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (Figure 1), which are
triggered by activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptors (NMDARs). We will therefore begin with a
discussion of their underlying mechanisms. We will then
proceed to reviewing some of the other prominent forms of
LTP and LTD for which mechanisms have been most firmly
established.

NMDAR-Dependent LTP
No form of plasticity has generated more interest, or been
more extensively studied than LTP in the CA1 region of the
hippocampus. The excitement surrounding this phenom-
enon is due to compelling evidence from rodents, primates,
and humans associating the hippocampus with a neural
system involved in various forms of long-term memory
(Martin et al, 2000; Zola-Morgan and Squire, 1993).
Furthermore, several basic properties of LTP make it an
attractive cellular mechanism for rapid information storage.
Similar to memory, LTP can be generated rapidly and is
strengthened and prolonged by repetition. It also exhibits
cooperativity, associativity, and input specificity. (Nicoll
et al, 1988). Cooperativity means that LTP can be induced
by the coincident activation of a critical number of
synapses. Associativity is the capacity to potentiate a weak
input (a small number of synapses) when it is activated in
association with a strong input (a larger number of
synapses). As such, associativity is a cellular analogue of
classical conditioning and is an implicit property of the so-
called Hebbian synapse. Input specificity indicates that LTP
is elicited only at activated synapses and not at adjacent,
inactive synapses on the same postsynaptic cell. This feature
dramatically increases the storage capacity of individual
neurons since different synapses on the same cell can be
involved in separate circuits encoding different bits of
information.
A major technological advance in the study of synaptic
plasticity was the development of the hippocampal slice
preparation that made LTP accessible to rigorous experi-
mental analysis (Figure 1b). Indeed, the bulk of our
knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of LTP has been
derived from studies of LTP at excitatory synapses on CA1
pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices. Similar or
identical forms of LTP have been observed at excitatory
synapses throughout the brain. Thus, the conclusions drawn
from the study of LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region are
often applied to other brain regions.
Triggering NMDAR-dependent LTP. A major advance in
the understanding of excitatory synaptic function and LTP
was the demonstration that two major types of ionotropic
glutamate receptors contribute to the postsynaptic response
at glutamatergic synapses, a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-
isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors (AMPARs) and
NMDARs (Figure 1c). These receptors are often (although
not always, as will be elaborated upon later) found

NMDAR-dependent LTP and LTD at hippocampal CA1 synapses. (a) Sample experiments illustrating LTP and LTD in the CA1 region of the
hippocampus. Synaptic strength, defined as the initial slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP; normalized to baseline) is plotted as a
function of time. Left panel demonstrates LTP elicited by high-frequency tetanic stimulation (100 Hz stimulation for 1 s; black arrowhead). Right panel
illustrates LTD elicited by low-frequency stimulation (5 Hz stimulation for 3 min given twice with a 3 min interval; open arrow). Data traces were taken at the
times indicated by the numbers on the graphs (scale bar: 0.5 mV; 10 ms) (courtesy of W Morishita). (b) A schematic diagram of the rodent hippocampal slice

placements for studying synaptic plasticity at Schaffer collateral synapses onto CA1 neurons are indicated (Stim ¼ stimulating electrode; Rec ¼ recording
electrode). (c) Model of synaptic transmission at excitatory synapses. During basal synaptic transmission (left panel), synaptically released glutamate binds
both the NMDA and AMPARs. Na + flows through the AMPAR channel but not through the NMDAR channel because of the Mg2 + block of this channel.
Depolarization of the postsynaptic cell (right) relieves the Mg2 + block of the NMDAR channel and allows both Na + and Ca2 + to flow into the dendritic
spine. The resultant increase in Ca2 + in the dendritic spine is necessary for triggering the subsequent events that drive synaptic plasticity.

colocalized on individual dendritic spines. The AMPAR has
a channel that is permeable to monovalent cations (Na +
and K +), and activation of AMPARs provides most of the
inward current that generates the excitatory synaptic
response when the cell is close to its resting membrane
potential. In contrast to AMPARs, the NMDAR exhibits a
strong voltage dependence because of the block of its
channel at negative membrane potentials by extracellular
magnesium (Mayer et al, 1984; Nowak et al, 1984). As a
result,
NMDARs
contribute
little
to
the
postsynaptic
response during basal synaptic activity. However, when
the cell is depolarized, magnesium dissociates from its
binding site within the NMDAR channel, allowing ions to
enter the cell. Importantly, unlike AMPAR channels, the
NMDAR channel allows calcium as well as sodium to enter
the postsynaptic dendritic spine (Figure 1c).
It is firmly established that the triggering (also termed the
induction) of LTP in the CA1 region requires activation of
NMDARs during strong postsynaptic depolarization leading
to
a
increase
in
postsynaptic
calcium
concentration,
which likely has to reach some critical threshold value to
activate the biochemical processes necessary for LTP
(Malenka, 1991; Malenka and Nicoll, 1993). Experimentally,
this is normally achieved by applying high-frequency
tetanic stimulation to the synapses or by use of a ‘pairing-
protocol’ during which the postsynaptic cell is directly
depolarized while low-frequency synaptic activation is
sustained. An additional method for induction of LTP (as
well as LTD) involves protocols that generate so-called
‘spike-time dependent plasticity’ (STDP; Dan and Poo, 2006;
Markram et al, 1997). In studies of STDP, LTP is induced
if afferent stimulation generates a synaptic response within
a
discrete
time
window
prior
to
the
firing
of
the
postsynaptic cell.
Because its contribution to postsynaptic reponses re-
quires both presynaptic release of glutamate and post-
synaptic depolarization due to the simultaneous activation
of a population of synapses, the NMDAR is often referred to
as a ‘coincidence detector’. These properties of NMDARs
also explain the basic properties of LTP. Cooperativity and
associativity occur because of the requirement for multiple
synapses
to
be
activated
simultaneously
to
generate
adequate postsynaptic depolarization to remove the mag-
nesium block of the NMDAR. Input specificity is due to the
compartmentalized increase in calcium, which is limited to
the postsynaptic dendritic spine and does not influence
adjacent spines (Nicoll et al, 1988).
LTP
signal
transduction
mechanisms.
An
extensive
number
of
signal
transduction
molecules
have
been
suggested to play a role in translating the calcium signal
that is required to trigger LTP into the long-lasting increase
in synaptic strength (Malenka and Bear, 2004; Sanes and
Lichtman, 1999). However, only for a handful of these has
compelling evidence of a mandatory role in LTP been
presented. A major limitation of much of the literature on
this topic stems from inadequate distinctions between
molecules that are key components of the molecular
machinery directly responsible for the triggering of LTP
(‘mediators’), and those molecules which may modulate
the ability to generate LTP, or play a permissive role
(‘modulators’). Some basic criteria that can be suggested for
defining the role of a protein as a mediator of LTP induction
are: (1) blocking the activation of the molecule during LTP
induction blocks LTP; and (2) activation of the molecule
induces a potentiation of synaptic transmission, which
occludes further synaptic induction of LTP.
Strong
evidence
indicates
that
calcium/calmodulin
(CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) fulfills these
requirements and is a key component of the molecular
machinery for LTP. CaMKII undergoes autophosphoryla-
tion after the triggering of LTP (Barria et al, 1997; Fukunaga
et al, 1995), and LTP induction was prevented both in
knockout mice lacking a critical CaMKII subunit (Silva
et al, 1992), and in knock-in animals in which endogenous
CaMKII was replaced with a form lacking the autopho-
sphorylation site (Giese et al, 1998). Furthermore, inhibition
of CaMKII activity by directly loading postsynaptic cells
with peptides that impair CaMKII function blocks LTP
(Malenka et al, 1989; Malinow et al, 1989), whereas acutely
increasing the postsynaptic concentration of active CaMKII
increases synaptic strength and occludes LTP (Lledo et al,
1995; Pettit et al, 1994).
Several other kinases have been implicated in the
triggering of LTP, but the experimental evidence supporting
their role is not as well substantiated as that for CaMKII.
Activation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-depen-
dent protein kinase (PKA), perhaps by the activation of a
calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase, has been suggested
to boost the activity of CaMKII indirectly by decreasing
competing protein phosphatase activity (Blitzer et al, 1998;
Lisman, 1989; Makhinson et al, 1999). This presumably
happens by phosphorylation of inhibitor 1, an endogenous
inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). The extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
(Erk)/mitogen-activated
protein
kinase (MAPK) pathway has also been suggested to be
important for LTP, as well as some forms of learning and
memory (Sweatt, 2004; Thomas and Huganir, 2004). In
addition, Src kinase has been implicated in the enhance-
ment of NMDAR function during LTP induction (Kalia
et al, 2004). Finally, protein kinase C and in particular the
atypical
PKC
isozyme,
PKMz,
has
received
attention
because this isozyme is rapidly expressed upon induction
of LTP and recent studies have implicated PKMz in the
maintenance of the late phase of LTP both in hippocampal
slices and in vivo (Hrabetova and Sacktor, 1996; Ling et al,
2002; Pastalkova et al, 2006; Serrano et al, 2005).
Obviously, it remains a very challenging task to be able to
definitively identify the key intracellular signaling cascades
responsible for the triggering of LTP. Recent technical
advances in mass spectrometric techniques for the profiling
of post-transcriptional modifications in mixed populations
of proteins, as well as the practicality of RNAi approaches
for knockdown of candidate proteins, should help further
characterize the major LTP players and their dynamic
interplay.
Expression mechanisms of LTP. In the past, a major point
of contention was whether LTP was primarily expressed
postsynaptically as a change in AMPAR properties or
presynaptically, as a change in the probability of transmitter
release. This latter expression mechanism garnered sig-
nificant attention because it required the production of a
retrograde messenger that was released by postsynaptic

cells and acted on presynaptic terminals (for a thorough
review of the evidence for either locus of expression, see
Nicoll, 2003). To a large extent, this controversy has been
resolved, with the emerging consensus that the major
mechanism of expression of LTP at hippocampal CA1
synapses involves an increase in the numbers of AMPARs
within the postsynaptic density, driven through activity-
dependent changes in AMPAR trafficking (Bredt and Nicoll,
2003; Derkach et al, 2007; Malenka and Nicoll, 1999;
Malinow and Malenka, 2002; Song and Huganir, 2002).
A major contribution to ending the controversy was the
proposal of the silent synapse hypothesis and the evidence
supporting it (Durand et al, 1996; Isaac et al, 1995; Liao
et al, 1995; Malenka and Nicoll, 1997). Silent synapses are
synapses that contain only NMDARs with few or no
AMPARs, such that at normal resting membrane potentials
these synapses exhibit no detectable postsynaptic responses
to synaptically released glutamate. The ‘unsilencing’ of these
synapses during the induction of LTP is thought to occur
through the incorporation of AMPARs into the postsynaptic
plasma membrane. This hypothesis was quickly expanded
to include synapses that already contained AMPARs and
has led to a large investigative effort into the molecular
mechanisms regulating the trafficking of AMPARs (Bredt
and Nicoll, 2003; Collingridge et al, 2004; Malinow and
Malenka, 2002; Sheng and Kim, 2002; Song and Huganir,
2002).
Most
AMPARs
in
the
central
nervous
system
are
tetramers comprised of four glutamate receptor subunits,
GluR1–GluR4. Although these subunits are highly homo-
logous, both the functional properties of AMPARs and their
trafficking has been suggested to depend on their subunit
composition (Collingridge et al, 2004; Derkach et al, 2007;
Malinow and Malenka, 2002). In the adult hippocampus,
two forms of AMPARs are thought to predominate: GluR1/
GluR2 heteromers and GluR2/GluR3 heteromers (Wenthold
et al, 1996). Based on clever overexpression studies, one
prominent hypothesis suggests that subunit-specific rules
govern the synaptic delivery of AMPARs (Hayashi et al,
2000; Passafaro et al, 2001; Shi et al, 2001). Specifically, it
has been suggested that the insertion of GluR1-containing
AMPARs into synapses is slow under basal conditions and
is strongly stimulated by NMDAR activation, whereas
insertion of GluR2/3 heteromeric receptors may occur
constitutively on a much more rapid timescale.
Where do these new AMPARs come from and how is their
trafficking regulated at a molecular level? Current evidence
suggests that recycling endosomes in the dendrites contain
a reserve pool of AMPARs that are mobilized during LTP
via a process that requires the small GTP-binding protein,
Rab11a (Park et al, 2004) (Figure 2). Surprisingly, AMPARs
do not appear to be inserted directly into the postsynaptic
density (PSD) but rather are exocytosed at perisynaptic
sites. They then can laterally diffuse in the plasma
membrane and be trapped within the PSD due to their
interactions with so-called ‘slot proteins’, which function to
trap AMPARs and greatly reduce their lateral mobility.
Attractive candidates for these slot proteins are a family of
proteins found in the PSD termed MAGUKs (for mem-
brane-associated guanylate kinases). MAGUKS are defined
by
their
multiple
protein
interaction
domains,
most
importantly so-called PDZ domains. Prominent members
of the MAGUK family of PSD proteins include PSD-95,
SAP97, PSD-93, and SAP102 (Kim and Sheng, 2004;
Montgomery et al, 2004). PSD-95 has received the most
attention and its level appears to be particularly important
for controlling the number of AMPARs at individual
synapses as evidenced by the findings that overexpression
of PSD-95 increases synaptic strength and occludes LTP
(Ehrlich and Malinow, 2004; Stein et al, 2003), whereas
knockdown of PSD-95 decreases surface expression of
AMPARs and synaptic strength (Ehrlich et al, 2007; Schluter
et al, 2006).
The influence of PSD-95, as well as other MAGUKS (Elias
et al, 2006; Futai et al, 2007; Schluter et al, 2006), on
AMPARs was surprising given that PSD-95 was originally
isolated because of its strong interaction with NMDARs
(Kornau et al, 1995). Another major surprise was that
AMPARs do not directly bind to MAGUKs but rather do so
via a family of AMPAR auxiliary subunits termed trans-
membrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs). TARPs
are required for the delivery of AMPARs to the plasma
membrane at extrasynaptic sites (Chen et al, 2000; Nicoll
et al, 2006) and also influence their biophysical properties
(Tomita et al, 2005a). Importantly, they are also required
for the synaptic localization of AMPARs due to their direct
interaction with MAGUKs (Schnell et al, 2002).
The detailed molecular mechanisms by which activation
of protein kinases such as CaMKII lead to the synaptic
delivery of AMPARs remains to be determined. Phosphor-
ylation of AMPAR subunits themselves by CaMKII does not
appear critical (Esteban et al, 2003; Lee et al, 2003) although
other phosphorylation sites, such as the PKA or the PKC
sites on GluR1, may be important (Boehm et al, 2006;
Esteban et al, 2003). On the other hand, there is reasonable
evidence that phosphorylation of TARPs occurs following
CAMKII activation (Tsui and Malenka, 2006) and that this
may be critical for LTP (Tomita et al, 2005b). It is, however,
highly likely that AMPARs and TARPs are just a component
of a large complex of proteins, the phosphorylation of which
will be required for LTP expression.
LTP also appears to involve a phosphorylation-driven
increase in the single-channel conductance of AMPARs
themselves (Benke et al, 1998; Soderling and Derkach,
2000). Indeed, CaMKII phosphorylates Ser831 in the
intracellular C terminus of GluR1, resulting in a significant
increase in single-channel conductance of homomeric
GluR1 receptors (Derkach et al, 1999, 2007). However, one
important caveat of this conclusion is that synaptic GluR1-
containing AMPARs also contain GluR2, and in GluR1/2
heteromeric AMPARs, the enhanced conductance upon
phosphorylation by CaMKII is absent (Oh and Derkach,
2005).
Although the evidence to date suggests a more prominent
role for AMPAR exocytosis, the relative contribution of
AMPAR trafficking and changes in the biophysical proper-
ties of AMPARs to the increase in synaptic strength during
LTP are not well defined. One model for the successive
events occurring during the first hour of LTP involves
activation of calcium-dependent signal transduction path-
ways, notably CaMKII, resulting in phosphorylation of
GluR1-containing receptors and an increase in their single-
channel conductance. Roughly simultaneously, AMPARs
are translocated into the PSD via exocytosis and lateral

movement within the plasma membrane. Most investigators
believe that the incorporation of AMPARs into the PSD is
the more important change because it appears to be
accompanied by structural changes in the dendritic spines
and synapses themselves, an attractive mechanism for
maintaining LTP (see below). There are also experimental
findings consistent with rapid presynaptic changes during
LTP, but the retrograde messenger that is responsible
remains elusive, one prominent possibility being BDNF
(Bramham and Messaoudi, 2005).
Maintaining
LTP.
Much
of
the
work
on
NMDAR-
dependent LTP has focused on the mechanisms responsible
for its initial 30–60 min, to a large extent because of
technical limitations in the duration over which stable
electrophysiological recordings can be maintained. None-
theless, the mechanisms that allow LTP to persist for hours,
days, or even longer are of great importance. Like virtually
all cell biological phenomena, the persistence of LTP is
dependent upon new protein synthesis (Reymann and Frey,
2007). This so-called ‘late phase of LTP’ (defined as the
potentiation present more than 1–2 h after LTP induction)
is commonly assumed to depend upon local dendritic
protein synthesis, which supplies needed components to the
synapse (Sutton and Schuman, 2006), as well as transcrip-
tion in the nucleus (Zhou et al, 2006). The signaling to the
nucleus required for long-lasting LTP has been suggested to
depend on a number of protein kinases including PKA,
CaMKIV, and Erk-MAPK, which activate key transcription
factors that may include cAMP response element-binding
protein and immediate-early genes such as c-Fos and
Zif268/Egr-1 (Thomas and Huganir, 2004). These transcrip-
tional
complexes
presumably
promote
expression
of
effector genes that are required for maintaining the synaptic
enhancement.
Several mRNAs can be found in dendrites, including
those of the AMPARs themselves, CaMKII, Arc, and
proteins which may function to regulate receptor trafficking
(Grooms et al, 2006; Job and Eberwine, 2001; Ju et al, 2004;
Mayford et al, 1996; Schuman et al, 2006; Steward and
Schuman, 2001). The trafficking of some of these mRNAs
and their local translation seems to be highly regulated by
activity. Furthermore, other components of the translational
machinery are found in or adjacent to dendritic spines and
polyribosomes are recruited to spine heads following LTP
induction (Bourne et al, 2007). Thus, there is accumulating
evidence that the machinery to provide local, newly
synthesized proteins to synapses is available.
An intriguing hypothesis is that during the synaptic
activation to induce LTP a ‘synaptic tag’ is generated that
functions to capture or sequester plasticity related proteins,
which in turn are required to stabilize the increase in
synaptic strength (Frey and Morris, 1997). However, little is
known about the identity of the synaptic tag or the newly
synthesized proteins that are required to maintain LTP,
although it has been suggested that PKA, CAMKII, or PKMz
might function as the synaptic tag (Reymann and Frey,
2007; Sajikumar et al, 2005; Young et al, 2006).

Model of AMPAR trafficking during LTP and LTD. In the basal state (depicted on top), receptors cycle between the postsynaptic membrane and
intracellular compartments. This is achieved through lateral mobility of the receptors out of the synapse into endocytic zones, where they are endocytosed
into early endosomes in a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent manner. Normally, the receptors are transferred to recycling endosomes and returned to the
plasma membrane by exocytosis, followed by lateral movement into the synapse where they are retained through interaction with MAGUKs. Following
induction of LTP, there is enhanced receptor exocytosis and stabilization at the synapse through a calcium-driven process that involves CAMKII and fusion of
recycling endosomes mediated by Rab11a. Following the induction of LTD, enhanced endocytosis at extrasynaptic sites occurs in a process that is calcium-
dependent and involves protein phosphatases, primarily calcineurin and protein phosphatases 1 (PP1). While in the basal state endocytosis is presumably
balanced by receptor recycling, following LTD receptors are retained within the cell, and perhaps degraded.

potentiated synapses (Luscher et al, 2000). Spines come in a
variety of shapes and sizes, and can undergo rapid shape
changes
that
are
influenced
by
activity
(Yuste
and
Bonhoeffer, 2001). Morphological changes which have been
reported
to
accompany LTP
include
growth
of new
dendritic spines, enlargement of preexisiting spines and
their PSDs, and the splitting of single PSDs and spines into
two functional synapses (Abraham and Williams, 2003;
Matsuzaki et al, 2004; Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2001). An
attractive
model
suggests
that
during
LTP,
recycling
endosomes contribute AMPAR subunits to the synapse, as
well as lipids and constituents which enlarge the synapse
(Lisman and Zhabotinsky, 2001; Luscher et al, 2000; Park
et al, 2004, 2006). At some later time point, there is likely a
concomitant increase in the presynaptic active zone, the size
of which always closely matches that of the PSD (Lisman
and Harris, 1993). This presynaptic re-modeling must
involve post- and presynaptic protein interactions with
likely candidates being cell adhesion molecules such as the
cadherins or neuroligin/neurexin interactions.
Summary. The current view of the mechanisms underlying
this form of LTP can be summarized as follows (Figure 2). A
large
NMDAR-dependent
increase
in
dendritic
spine
calcium concentrations leads to activation of intracellular
signaling cascades involving a number of protein kinases,
most importantly CaMKII. This leads to an increase in the
single-channel conductance of synaptic AMPARs and more
importantly, promotes the incorporation of additional
AMPARs into the PSD. The new synaptic AMPARs are
stabilized through their TARP-mediated interaction with
PDZ domain-containing proteins such as PSD-95. In
parallel, structural changes within the synapse occur, such
that the size of the PSD and dendritic spine are increased.
This in turn drives an increase in the size of the presynaptic
active
zone
such
that
the
potentiated
synapses
are
‘permanently’ enlarged. The maintenance of these changes
for more than a few hours depends on de novo transcription
as well as local dendritic protein synthesis, presumbably to
provide the synapses with a supply of the critical proteins
necessary for maintaining synaptic strength.
NMDAR-Dependent LTD
An important advance in the study of long-term synaptic
plasticity was the establishment of an experimentally
reproducible form of NMDAR-dependent LTD at excitatory
synapses on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (Dudek and
Bear, 1992). This demonstrated that activity could bi-
directionally control synaptic strength (Mulkey and Malenka,
1992), thus providing support for the idea that memories or
experiences were encoded by the distribution of synaptic
weights in neural circuits, not simply by LTP. Shortly
thereafter,
a
similar
form
of
LTD
was
observed
at
neocortical synapses (Kirkwood et al, 1993) suggesting that
mechanistic studies in the hippocampal CA1 region could
provide
insights
that
applied
to
excitatory
synapses
throughout the brain. While that remains true to a large
extent, we now know that in addition to NMDAR-dependent
LTD, there are several other forms of LTD, which we will
discuss in later sections. Moreover, similar to LTP, evidence
is accumulating that LTD mechanisms may contribute to a
large number of brain phenomena including experience-
dependent development, learning and memory, addiction,
and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and
Parkinson’s disease (Malenka and Bear, 2004; Brebner et al,
2005; Kreitzer and Malenka 2007; Hsieh et al, 2006).
Triggering NMDAR-dependent LTD. The typical protocol
for
eliciting
LTD
involves
prolonged
repetitive
low-
frequency stimulation (B900 stimuli at 1 Hz; Dudek and
Bear, 1992; Mulkey and Malenka, 1992), although the
number of stimuli can be dramatically reduced and the
frequency changed if the postsynaptic neuron is modestly
depolarized (to B50 mV), partially relieving the Mg2 +
block of the NMDAR (Selig et al, 1995). NMDAR-dependent
LTD can also be induced by correctly timing the activation
of presynaptic axons and the postsynaptic neuron (STDP;
(Dan and Poo, 2006).
Like LTP, LTD is input-specific and depends upon an
NMDAR-dependent
increase
in
postsynaptic
calcium
(Mulkey and Malenka, 1992). The predominant current
hypothesis is that quantitative properties of the postsynap-
tic calcium signal within dendritic spines dictates whether
LTP or LTD is triggered, with LTD requiring a modest
increase in calcium (Cummings et al, 1996), whereas LTP
requires a increase beyond some critical threshold value
(Malenka and Nicoll, 1993). The temporal characteristics of
the increase in calcium may also be important since
changing the relative timing between pre- and postsynaptic
activation by just a few tens of milliseconds can reverse the
direction of synaptic modification (Dan and Poo, 2006).
Differential buffering of postsynaptic calcium levels has
been reported to enable a transition between LTP and LTD
(Harney et al, 2006; Nishiyama et al, 2000). These findings
demonstrate the thin line that lies between synaptic activity
eliciting a potentiation vs a depression and provide support
to the idea that both LTP and LTD are utilized in parallel for
encoding experiences in vivo.
LTD signal transduction mechanisms. An influential
hypothesis for the signal transduction pathway triggering
LTD suggested that while LTP was due to the preferential
activation of CaMKII, LTD involves activation of a calcium-
dependent protein phosphatase cascade consisting of the
calcium/calmodulin-dependent
phosphatase
calcineurin
(also known as protein phosphatase 2B), PP1, and a
phosphoprotein termed inhibitor-1 which functions to
inhibit PP1 until it is dephosphorylated by calcineurin
(Lisman, 1989). Consistent with this hypothesis, postsynap-
tic inhibition of these phosphatases prevents LTD (Kirk-
wood and Bear, 1994; Morishita et al, 2001; Mulkey et al,
1994, 1993), whereas directly loading CA1 pyramidal cells
with PP1 enhances LTD (Morishita et al, 2001). Although
signaling proteins other than phosphatases have been
suggested to play key roles in LTD (Bolshakov et al, 2000;
Dan and Poo, 2006; Palmer et al, 2005; Peineau et al, 2007),
the hypothesis that LTP involves preferential activation of
protein kinases while LTD involves activation of phospha-
tases remains predominant.

(Hrabetova and Sacktor, 1996; Kameyama et al, 1998; Lee

dephosphorylation

substrates
during

particularly convincing, as postsynaptic inhibition of PKA,

(Gomez et al, 2002; Snyder et al, 2005). Consistent with a
role for PKA, LTD is associated with selective depho-
sphorylation of Ser845 on GluR1, a PKA substrate site (Lee
et al, 2000). This dephosphorylation event may contribute
to the expression of LTD, as it decreases the AMPAR open-
channel probability (Banke et al, 2000), and mice with
knock-in alanine substitution of both Ser845 and Ser831 (a
CaMKII-substrate site) exhibit impaired NMDAR-depen-
dent LTD (Lee et al, 2003).
Expression mechanisms of LTD. The demonstration of
silent synapses and their conversion to functional synapses
during LTP by the incorporation of AMPARs (Malenka and
Nicoll, 1997) immediately gave credence to the idea that the
opposite might happen during LTD, that is, the removal or
endocytosis of AMPARs. Consistent with this idea, it was
demonstrated that pharmacological manipulations of activ-
ity in cultured neurons (Carroll et al, 1999; Lissin et al,
1998) or application of glutamate receptor agonists (Beattie
et al, 2000; Carroll et al, 1999; Ehlers, 2000; Heynen et al,
2000; Lin et al, 2000; Lissin et al, 1998) could cause a loss of
AMPARs from synapses due to dynamin- and clathrin-
dependent endocytosis (Carroll et al, 2001; Collingridge
et al, 2004; Derkach et al, 2007; Malinow and Malenka,
2002). Furthermore, postsynaptic inhibition of dynamin
activity impaired LTD in CA1 pyramidal cells in slices (Lee
et al, 2002; Luscher et al, 1999; Morishita et al, 2005). Based
in large part on these sorts of observations, the current
leading hypothesis is that the expression mechanism of
NMDAR-dependent LTD is due to activity-dependent
endocytosis of synaptic AMPARs (Bredt and Nicoll, 2003;
Collingridge et al, 2004; Derkach et al, 2007; Malenka and
Bear, 2004; Malinow and Malenka, 2002) (Figure 2).
The precise molecular mechanisms by which endocytosis
of AMPARs occurs during LTD is still not clear but one
likely scenario is that it involves dissociation of AMPARs
from their anchors within the PSD, followed by lateral
movement to the edge of the PSD where they undergo
clathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis (Ashby et al,
2004; Blanpied et al, 2002; Groc et al, 2004). Consistent with
a key role for protein phosphatases, the endocytosis of
AMPARs is regulated by calcium-dependent dephosphor-
ylation (Beattie et al, 2000; Carroll et al, 2001; Ehlers, 2000).
Key substrates for facilitating endocytosis may include
components of the endocytic machinery (Carroll et al, 2001;
Lai et al, 1999; Slepnev et al, 1998) as well as AMPAR
subunits themselves (Ehlers, 2000). Following endocytosis,
AMPARs exhibit increased colocalization with the clathrin
adaptor protein AP2 (Carroll et al, 1999), an interaction that
may be promoted by the Ca2 +-dependent adaptor protein
hippocalcin (Palmer et al, 2005).
Consistent with a role for ‘slot proteins’ in the regulation
of AMPAR surface levels, LTD has been reported to depend
on PP1-dependent dephosphorylation of stargazin (Tomita
et al, 2005b). This dephosphorylation might permit the
dissociation of stargazin from PSD-95 and its diffusion out
of the PSD, enabling LTD through loss of synaptic AMPARs
(Ziff, 2007). Ubiquitination (Colledge et al, 2003) or
depalmitoylation (El-Husseini et al, 2002) of PSD-95 has
also been suggested to be critical for agonist-induced
endocytosis of AMPARs but whether these events are
required for synaptically induced LTD has not been
determined. Additional proteins implicated in AMPAR
endocytosis include the AMPAR interacting protein PICK1
(Hanley and Henley, 2005; Kim et al, 2001), the small
GTPases Rap1 (Zhu et al, 2002, 2005) and Rab5 (Brown
et al, 2005), and a protein termed cpg2 (Cottrell et al, 2004).
It has been suggested that particular AMPAR subunits,
specifically GluR2, may be especially important for the
endocytosis of AMPARs during LTD, in part because of its
direct interaction with AP2 (Lee et al, 2002). One key
finding consistent with this hypothesis is that peptides that
selectively interfere with this interaction have been reported
to inhibit LTD (Lee et al, 2002). However, AP2 can bind
other AMPAR subunits (Kastning et al, 2007; Lee et al,
2002) and LTD is still observed in hippocampal slices
obtained from mice lacking GluR2 as well as GluR2 and
GluR3 (Jia et al, 1996; Meng et al, 2003). Thus, the
importance of specific AMPAR subunits for LTD is not
firmly established.
Summary. A current simplified view of the mechanisms
underlying NMDAR-dependent LTD can be summarized as
follows (Figure 2): a modest increase in postsynaptic
calcium concentration within dendritic spines due to
modest activation of NMDARs leads to preferential activa-
tion of protein phosphatases (as well as a few other key
signaling proteins). This leads to the dissociation of
AMPARs from their molecular scaffolds in the PSD and
their lateral movement to endocytic zones on the periphery
of the PSD, where they are endocytosed and potentially
degraded. We have not discussed the maintenance of LTD
because there is little work on this topic. There is evidence
that LTD is accompanied by a shrinkage in the size of
dendritic spines (Nagerl et al, 2004; Zhou et al, 2004) and
that this may be due to the loss of AMPARs (Hsieh et al,
2006). Furthermore, similar to LTP, protein translation may
be needed for the long-term stable expression of LTD
(Pfeiffer and Huber, 2006). Thus, it is generally believed that
the activity-dependent trafficking of AMPARs into and out
of synapses during LTP and LTD, respectively, is the first
critical step in the morphological growth or shrinkage of
synapses and that these structural modifications are the
mechanisms by which bidirectional changes in synaptic
strength are maintained. Indeed, the size of individual
synapses correlates closely with the number of AMPARs
they contain (Matsuzaki et al, 2001; Nusser et al, 1998;
Takumi et al, 1999).
Presynaptic LTP

for over 30 years, it is clear that a mechanistically distinct

form of plasticity coexists in the hippocampus at the so-
called mossy fiber synapses, the synapses between the axons
of dentate gyrus granule cells (ie, mossy fibers) and the
proximal apical dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells (Nicoll
and Malenka, 1995; Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005). Mossy fiber
LTP (MF-LTP) is of increasing interest due to the fact that it
appears to be a prototype for mechanistically similar forms
of LTP found in several other brain regions including the
thalamus at corticothalamic synapses (Castro-Alamancos
and Calcagnotto, 1999), the cerebellum at parallel fiber-
Purkinje cell synapses (Linden, 1997; Salin et al, 1996), and
perhaps in the striatum at cortico-striatal synapses (Spencer
and Murphy, 2002). Thus, like NMDAR-dependent LTP,
this form of LTP may play multiple functional roles in the
brain.
In contrast to NMDAR-dependent LTP, the triggering and
expression of this form of LTP is thought to be solely or
predominantly presynaptic, thus we refer to it as presynap-
tic LTP. While somewhat controversial, most experimental
evidence suggests that presynaptic LTP is triggered by high-
frequency tetanic stimulation, which causes a large, activity-
dependent increase in calcium concentration within pre-
synaptic axon terminals (Nicoll and Malenka, 1995; Nicoll
and Schmitz, 2005; Zalutsky and Nicoll, 1990). Presynaptic
voltage-dependent calcium channels are the critical source
of the calcium increase, although the triggering of this LTP
at MF synapses can be facilitated by the activation of
presynaptic kainate receptors, particularly GluR6 (Lauri
et al, 2001; Schmitz et al, 2003). Results from pharmaco-
logical manipulations and knockout mice are all consistent
with the hypothesis that the increase in presynaptic calcium
activates a calcium/calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase.
This leads to a increase in presynaptic cAMP and activation
of PKA, which phosphorylates critical presynaptic sub-
strates to cause a long-lasting enhancement in transmitter
release (Nicoll and Malenka, 1995; Nicoll and Schmitz,
2005). Although this sequence of events is consistent with
most of the results from all of the synapses that have been
reported to express presynaptic LTP, surprisingly, a very
different postsynaptic induction mechanism has been
proposed to occur at MF synapses. This involves trans-
synaptic interactions between postsynaptic EphB receptor
tyrosine kinases and presynaptic B-Ephrin ligands leading,
via an unknown mechanism, to a long-lasting enhancement
of transmitter release (Armstrong et al, 2006; Contractor
et al, 2002).
Despite some controversy concerning the mechanism
underlying the induction of presynaptic LTP at MF
synapses, there is general agreement that its expression is
due to an increase in neurotransmitter release. One
mechanism
for
mediating
a
long-lasting
increase
in
transmitter release is to enhance the calcium influx into
the presynaptic terminal when it is invaded by an action
potential; for example via a long-lasting modulation of
presynaptic calcium channels. However, direct imaging of
the action potential-dependent increase in presynaptic
calcium in MF boutons indicates that no change occurs
following the triggering of MF-LTP (Kamiya et al, 2002;
Regehr and Tank, 1991; Reid et al, 2004).
The other major mechanism for enhancing transmitter
release is via some modulation of the machinery responsible
for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. In this context, the focus has
been on presynaptic proteins known to be substrates for
PKA. Because presynaptic terminals are relatively inacces-
sible, an important approach has been examining knockout
mice lacking specific presynaptic proteins. Mice lacking
synapsins exhibited normal MF-LTP (Spillane et al, 1995)
indicating that these prominent PKA substrates were not
necessary. In contrast, knockout animals lacking the
synaptic vesicle protein Rab3A, a small GTPase (Castillo
et al, 1997; Lonart et al, 1998), or its binding partner, the
active zone protein Rim1a (Castillo et al, 2002; Powell et al,
2004) lack both MF-LTP as well as presynaptic LTP in the
cerebellum. Rim1a is a substrate of PKA and thus these
findings suggest that presynaptic LTP may require a GTP-
dependent interaction between Rab3a and Rim1a at the
interface of synaptic vesicles and the active zone. Indeed,
using cultures of cerebellar neurons in which presynaptic
LTP can be elicited, the critical residue phosphorylated by
PKA in Rim1a has been identified (Lonart et al, 2003). One
important caveat to this hypothesis, however, is that the
presynaptic enhancement of synaptic transmission seen
upon application of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin
is unaltered in knockout mice lacking Rab3a or Rim1a. This
provides a complication for the simple model implicating
Rim1a and Rab3a as the crucial mediators of the enhanced
transmission caused by presynaptic activation of PKA.
Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor-Dependent
LTD
Under the appropriate experimental conditions, low-fre-
quency stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural
inputs to CA1 pyramidal cells can trigger, in addition to
NMDAR-dependent LTD, a mechanistically distinct form of
LTD, that is dependent upon activation of metabotropic
glutamate receptors (mGluRs; mGLUR LTD) (Anwyl, 2006;
Bolshakov et al, 2000; Malenka and Bear, 2004; Oliet et al,
1997). Various forms of mGluR LTD have been observed in
many brain regions, most notably at the parallel fiber to
Purkinje cell synapse (Ito, 1989; Linden and Connor, 1995).
This so-called cerebellar LTD is elicited when parallel fibers
are activated coincident with climbing fiber activation and
has been suggested to be particularly important for certain
forms of motor learning.
Typically, the induction of mGluR LTD in the CA1 region
of the hippocampus requires bursts of afferent stimulation
or paired-pulse stimulation at modest frequencies. Pre-
sumably, this increases the likelihood of activating the
extrasynaptic group I mGluRs that are required to trigger
this form of plasticity. mGluR LTD can also be elicited by
bath application of group I mGluR agonists such as DHPG
(Bellone and Luscher, 2005; Huber et al, 2000, 2001). Group
I mGluRs (mGluR1 and mGluR5) are defined by their
capacity to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis and
thereby produce diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate.
Although mGluR1 is the principal receptor implicated in the
induction of mGluR LTD in the ventral tegmental area
(VTA), cerebellum, and neostriatum, mGluR5 has been
implicated
in
the
hippocampus,
cortex,
and
nucleus
accumbens (Anwyl, 2006).
The intracellular signaling pathways responsible for
mGluR LTD have not been extensively examined. PKC
appears to be required for mGluR LTD in the cerebellum

(De Zeeuw et al, 1998; Linden and Connor, 1991) and the
VTA (Bellone and Luscher, 2005), but perhaps not in the
hippocampus (Huang and Hsu, 2006). Other signaling
proteins suggested to be important for mGluR LTD include
the MAPKs p38, Erk, and Jnk (Gallagher et al, 2004; Li et al,
2007; Rush et al, 2002), tyrosine phosphatases (Huang and
Hsu, 2006; Moult et al, 2006), and phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (Hou and Klann, 2004) but how these various
enzymes might lead to a long-lasting decrease in synaptic
strength is unknown.
Similar to NMDAR-dependent LTD, mGluR LTD in the
hippocampus and cerebellum appears to involve clathrin-
dependent endocytosis of AMPARs (Snyder et al, 2001;
Wang and Linden, 2000; Xiao et al, 2001). For cerebellar
mGluR LTD, a large body of work is consistent with a
specific molecular model in which mGluR activation due to
parallel fiber stimulation combined with calcium influx due
to climbing fiber activation results in activation of PKCa
and its targeting to synapses via the protein PICK1 (Jorntell
and Hansel, 2006; Perez et al, 2001; Steinberg et al, 2006).
PKCa then phosphorylates Ser880 on GluR2 causing GluR2
to dissociate from the AMPAR-binding proteins GRIP/ABP
and bind to PICK1. This then allows lateral diffusion of the
AMPARs and ultimately internalization (Chung et al, 2003;
Steinberg et al, 2006; Xia et al, 2000). This cascade of events
is significantly different than those believed to occur during
NMDAR-dependent LTD, pointing out that the molecular
mechanisms underlying apparently similar forms of plasti-
city may be cell type-specific. Indeed, mGluR LTD at
excitatory synapses onto dopamine cells in the VTA has
been suggested to involve a selective loss of AMPARs that
lack the GluR2 subunit (Bellone and Luscher, 2005, 2006),
rather than those that contain GluR2.
Another important feature of mGluR LTD, at least in the
hippocampus, is that it appears to be dependent on mGluR-
triggered protein synthesis (Hou and Klann, 2004; Huber
et al, 2000, 2001; Snyder et al, 2001). This link between
protein synthesis and mGluR LTD gained considerable
attention following the report that mice lacking the gene
encoding the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)
exhibited enhanced mGluR LTD in both the hippocampus
(Huber et al, 2002) and the cerebellum (Koekkoek et al,
2005). These mice serve as a model for the Fragile X
syndrome in humans, an X-linked form of mental retarda-
tion, and exhibit several features of the human disorder
(Bear et al, 2004). Surprisingly, the enhanced mGluR LTD
observed in the FMRP knockout mice is independent of
protein synthesis and proteasomal degradation (Hou et al,
2006; Nosyreva and Huber, 2006), cellular processes that
appear crucial for mGluR LTD in wild-type mice. Never-
theless, this potential link between an mGluR-triggered
form of synaptic plasticity and Fragile X syndrome has
focused
attention
on
mGluR
antagonists
as
possible
therapeutic agents for this and other developemental
disorders (Bear et al, 2004).
There are also results consistent with a presynaptic locus
of expression for mGluR LTD (Anwyl, 2006; Nosyreva and
Huber, 2005; Zakharenko et al, 2002). As these forms of
mGluR LTD are still triggered postsynaptically, they must
involve a retrograde messenger, one leading candidate being
12-lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid (Feinmark
et al, 2003). In an attempt to reconcile the observations of a
presynaptic locus of expression of mGluR LTD with the
bulk of the literature describing a postsynaptic locus of
expression, a developmental shift in the mechanisms of
mGluR LTD has been proposed (Nosyreva and Huber,
2005). Specifically, it has been suggested that in slices
prepared from neonatal (P8–P15) animals, mGluR-LTD is
independent of protein synthesis and is due to a presynaptic
modification, whereas in older animals (P21–P35) mGluR
LTD is mediated by a protein synthesis-dependent reduc-
tion in the postsynaptic levels of AMPARs.
Endocannabinoid-Mediated LTD
A major advance over the last decade has been the
demonstration of the existence of endogenous cannabinoids
(termed endocannabinoids) and their roles in modulating
synaptic function (Chevaleyre et al, 2006; Freund et al, 2003;
Kreitzer and Regehr, 2002; Piomelli, 2003; Wilson and
Nicoll, 2002). It is now well established that in a number of
brain regions endocannabinoids are retrograde messengers
that are released by postsynaptic cells in response to strong
depolarization
and/or
activation
of
G-protein-coupled
receptors (eg, mGluRs and muscarinic receptors) and
function to transiently inhibit transmitter release (for
B0.5–1 min) at either excitatory or inhibitory synpases
via activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors.
Much of the mechanistic work on the transient synaptic
effects of endocannabinioids was performed in the hippo-
campus and cerebellum, synapses that are often thought to
be prototypic of synapses throughout the brain. It was
therefore surprising when a form of LTD that required
endocannabinoids, (so-called endocannabinoid-mediated
LTD; eCB-LTD) was observed in the glutamatergic synapses
onto medium spiny neurons in the striatum as well as at
synapses between layer V pyramidal neurons (Gerdeman
et al, 2002; Robbe et al, 2002a; Sjostrom et al, 2003). In the
hippocampus, in contrast, endocannabinoids mediate a
form of LTD at inhibitory, but not excitatory, synapses
(Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2004). In the dorsal striatum, eCB-
LTD requires postsynaptic activation of group I mGluRs,
L-type calcium channels and D2 dopamine receptors (Choi
and Lovinger, 1997; Kreitzer and Malenka, 2005, 2007;
Pisani et al, 2005; Sung et al, 2001; Tang et al, 2001)
(Figure 3). This leads to the production most likely of
anandamide (Ade and Lovinger, 2007), which activates
presynaptic CB1 receptors. However, prolonged activation
of these CB1 receptors alone is not sufficient to elicit eCB-
LTD; concomitant presynaptic activity is also required, a
requirement that likely accounts for the input specificity of
this form of plasticity (Singla et al, 2007). Another
important feature of eCB-LTD in the dorsal striatum is
that it appears to be restricted to the medium spiny neurons
that primarily express D2 dopamine receptors and is not
present at excitatory synapses on cells expressing D1
receptors (Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007; but see Wang
et al, 2006). This cell-restricted expression of eCB-LTD
may have important functional implications, a topic to be
discussed below.
In the nucleus accumbens (NAc), eCB-LTD also requires
postsynaptic activation of group I mGluRs and is modulated
by drugs of abuse (Fourgeaud et al, 2004; Mato et al, 2004;
Robbe et al, 2002b). In the cortex, eCB-LTD can be elicited

by a spike-timing-dependent protocol (Sjostrom et al, 2003)
but does not depend on postsynaptic activation of mGluRs
and surprisingly, requires coincident activation of presy-
naptic NMDARs. LTD in the cerebellum was also reported
to depend on retrograde endocannabinoid signaling (Safo
and Regehr, 2005), but the mechanistic basis for this
observation is still unclear, since, as discussed above,
cerebellar LTD is expressed postsynaptically.
Metaplasticity
Metaplasticity refers to a higher-order form of synaptic
plasticity in which synaptic activity, which by itself does not
directly affect synaptic efficacy, leads to a persistent change
in the direction or magnitude of subsequent activity-
dependent synaptic plasticity. In other words, metaplasti-
city is the ‘plasticity of plasticity’ (Abraham and Bear, 1996;
Bear et al, 1987). The best-studied examples of metaplas-
ticity are those in which prior activity shifts the threshold
for LTP and LTD induction. For example, in the hippo-
campus, repetitive activation of NMDARs in a manner that
does not elicit LTP or LTD can nonetheless elicit a rapid
shift in plasticity thresholds such that LTP becomes difficult
to elicit and LTD induction is favored (Huang et al, 1992;
Wang and Wagner, 1999). A potential functional role for
metaplasticity has been demonstrated by modifying the
level of activity during the development of the visual cortex
in vivo (Philpot et al, 2001, 2003, 2007). This causes shifts in
the thresholds for LTP and LTD in cells in visual cortex
presumably due to changes in the stoichiometry of synaptic
NMDARs. As discussed below, such changes in synaptic
plasticity may importantly contribute to the experience-
dependent plasticity of ocular dominance following mani-
pulation of the visual environment.
Synaptic Scaling: A Form of Homeostatic
Plasticity
Theoretically, without additional stabilizing mechanisms,
activity-dependent forms of plasticity such as LTP and LTD
could drive neural circuit activity towards epileptogenic
excitation or complete quiescence. Synaptic scaling is
considered a form of homeostatic plasticity that counters
potentially maladaptive effects of long-term synapse-spe-
cific
plasticity
by
globally
affecting
the
transmission
through all synapses on a given neuron (Turrigiano and
Nelson, 2004). In terms of its basic properties and under-
lying mechanisms, this form of synaptic plasticity contrasts
dramatically with the forms of LTP and LTD we have
discussed thus far.
Synaptic scaling occurs when network activity is drama-
tically decreased or increased for prolonged (4B12–24 h)
periods of time. Decreased activity (due to blockade of
synaptic transmission or spiking) causes an increase in the
strength of all excitatory synapses onto excitatory neurons,
whereas increased activity (generally induced by partially
blocking inhibitory synapses) reduces the strength of all
excitatory synapses (Turrigiano et al, 1998). Importantly,
the relative strengths of individual synpases appear to be
maintained even though global synaptic input is signifi-
cantly altered.
Relatively little is known about the molecular mechan-
isms underlying synaptic scaling other than it involves
changes in the number of AMPARs (and NMDARs) at
individual synapses (Perez-Otano and Ehlers, 2005; Turri-
giano and Nelson, 2004; Watt et al, 2000) and likely
presynaptic changes as well (Burrone and Murthy, 2003;
Burrone et al, 2002). Recently, evidence has been presented
supporting a role for secreted factors in the induction of
homeostatic plasticity, suggesting that key triggers for this
form of plasticity may not be cell autonomous. Specifically,
secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis
factor-a from glial cells appears to be necessary for the
increase in the level of synaptic AMPARs caused by
extended periods of activity blockade (Beattie et al, 2002;
Stellwagen et al, 2005; Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006). In
addition, there is evidence suggesting a role for secreted
BDNF in driving the opposite form of synaptic scaling; the
decrease in synaptic strengths caused by extended periods
of increased network acitivity (Rutherford et al, 1998;
Turrigiano, 2006).
FUNCTIONAL ROLES OF LTP AND LTD

underlying many different forms of experience-dependent

receptors (D2R) enhances endocannabinoid production and the subse-
quent induction of presynaptic LTD, mediated through activation of
presynaptic CB1 receptors (CB1R). (From Kreitzer and Malenka, 2005.)

patterns of activity can elicit bidirectional control over
synaptic strength. Establishing a causal connection between
a specific form of synaptic plasticity and the behavioral
consequences of specific experiences remains a daunting
task. Nevertheless, over the last decade, significant advances
have been made in connecting synaptic plasticity to a
number of different types of adaptive experience-dependent
plasticity. Furthermore, it has become increasingly clear
that understanding the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity
may provide important insights into the pathophysiology of
a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders and also point the
way toward novel therapeutic approaches. In the following
sections, we will briefly provide examples that demonstrate
that LTP and LTD do occur in vivo in response to
experience and may play a causal role in mediating the
consequences of experience.
Hippocampal-Dependent Plasticity and Learning
Given that LTP was first described in the hippocampus, a
structure well established to be critically important for
declarative memory (Squire et al, 2004), it is not surprising
that over the last three decades there has been a major effort
aimed at demonstrating a role for hippocampal LTP in
encoding new memories (Martin et al, 2000; Morris, 2006).
Correlations have been observed between defective hippo-
campal synaptic plasticity and defective hippocampal-
dependent memory tasks upon perturbation of a number
of proteins which function in synaptic plasticity, either
pharmacologically, or through gene knockout (Lynch, 2004;
Martin et al, 2000; Morris, 2006). For example, rodents in
which NMDAR antagonists were infused into the hippo-
campus (Morris and Frey, 1997), as well as mice lacking
expression of the NMDAR subunit NR1 in the forebrain
(Tsien et al, 1996), are defective both in LTP and certain
types of spatial learning. Furthermore, mice in which the
specific NMDAR subunit NR2B was overexpressed to
enhance
NMDAR
function
were
reported
to
display
enhanced LTP and enhanced spatial learning (Tang et al,
1999). Recently, more compelling evidence for a role of
synaptic plasticity in hippocampal-dependent learning has
been presented. During an inhibitory avoidance task, LTP
could be recorded in vivo in a subset of hippocampal CA1
pyramidal cells (Whitlock et al, 2006). This demonstrated
that the patterns of activity generated during a real learning
task were sufficient to elicit LTP. Perhaps even more
convincing was the demonstration that in vivo infusion of a
PKMz
inhibitor
into
the
hippocampus
abolished
the
maintenance of LTP and simultaneously the storage of a
long-lasting spatial memory (Pastalkova et al, 2006). These
findings strongly suggest that maintained LTP was required
for the engram that stored the key spatial information.
In addition to its role as a key component of the
mechanisms underlying the encoding of declarative mem-
ories, hippocampal NMDAR-dependent LTP (as well as
LTD) may provide important insights into the pathophy-
siology and potential treatment of major mental illnesses.
For example, a leading hypothesis for the pathophysiology
of schizophrenia posits a dysfunction in glutamatergic
synapses, in particular a hypofunction of NMDARs (Coyle
and Tsai, 2004; Javitt, 2006; McCullumsmith et al, 2004;
Tamminga, 1998). Thus, understanding the signaling events
downstream of NMDAR activation may provide important
insights into this devastating disease. A role for dysfunc-
tions in LTP and/or LTD mechanisms as possible con-
tributors
to
schizophrenia
is
also
attractive
in
that
schizophrenia likely involves neurodevelopmental abnorm-
alities (Lewis and Levitt, 2002) and these phenomena play
an important role in the early postnatal development of
neural circuitry (see below). Indeed, genetic variation in
calcineurin, which is thought to play an important role in
NMDAR-dependent LTD, has been associated with schizo-
phrenia (Gerber et al, 2003).
Another example of the potential importance of studying
LTP and LTD comes from investigation into the therapeutic
mechanisms of drugs used to treat bipolar disorder. Drugs
such as lithium, valproate, and lamotrigine have been
reported to have significant effects on the phosphorylation
of AMPAR subunits and affect their surface expression (Du
et al, 2003, 2004, 2007; Gray et al, 2003). These findings
suggest that these drugs may somehow tap into the same
mechanisms that have evolved to generate LTP and LTD
and also point to novel approaches for the development of
new therapeutic agents that may prove efficacious for
treatment of this illness.
Experience-Dependent Plasticity in the
Developing Sensory Cortex
Sensory receptive fields in the cortex are modified by early
postnatal
experience
and
the
link
between
synaptic
plasticity and these forms of experience-dependent plasti-
city in sensory systems is becoming increasingly established
(Foeller and Feldman, 2004; Karmarkar and Dan, 2006;
Malenka and Bear, 2004). For example, a strong connection
between
synaptic
plasticity
and
experience-dependent
plasticity has been established in the visual system during
the shift in ocular dominance caused by monocular
deprivation (MD) (Foeller and Feldman, 2004; Karmarkar
and Dan, 2006; Malenka and Bear, 2004). MD induces
biochemical changes in AMPAR subunits in visual cortex
that appear identical to those elicited during NMDAR-
dependent LTD (Heynen et al, 2003) and visual cortical
slices obtained from monocularly deprived animals show
greatly reduced LTD (Crozier et al, 2007; Heynen et al,
2003), suggesting that LTD was elicited in vivo. Further-
more, in vivo recordings demonstrated that MD caused a
rapid decrease in the visually evoked potential (VEP) from
the deprived eye and a slower enhancement of the VEP from
the open eye (Frenkel and Bear, 2004). Importantly,
completely blocking activity in the deprived eye prevented
the depression of the VEP demonstrating that this depres-
sion required retinal activity and, like LTD, was therefore
activity-dependent (Frenkel and Bear, 2004).
Similar results have been obtained in somatosensory
barrel cortex in that sensory deprivation by whisker
trimming or plucking causes a weakening of synaptic
responses in layer 2/3 cells and an occlusion of LTD (Allen
et al, 2003). This appears to be due to alterations in the
patterns of pre- and postsynaptic spiking in vivo in a
manner that is ideal for generating spike-timing-dependent
LTD (Celikel et al, 2004). LTP mechanisms, on the other
hand, appear to be important for the strengthening of
synapses in developing barrel cortex due to early postnatal

experience. In vivo experience drives recombinant GluR1
into barrel cortex synapses in a manner similar to that
which occurs during NMDAR-dependent LTP, whereas
expression of a short peptide that inhibits delivery of
endogenous AMPARs blocks the experience-dependent
increase in synaptic strength (Takahashi et al, 2003) as
does a dominant-negative form of the synaptic scaffold
protein PSD-95 (Ehrlich and Malinow, 2004). Thus, as
predicted by theoretical considerations (Bienenstock et al,
1982; Stent, 1973), LTP and LTD mechanisms appear to be
critically involved in early neural circuit development and it
is not difficult
to
imagine how disruption
in these
mechanisms might contribute to a host of neurodevelope-
mental disorders such as autism (Geschwind and Levitt,
2007; Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003).
Synaptic Plasticity and Fear Conditioning
Pavlovian fear conditioning is a form of associative memory
that depends on the amygdala for its induction and
maintenance (Sigurdsson et al, 2007). It occurs when a
neutral stimulus (such as a tone) is temporally paired with a
strong noxious stimulus (such as an electric shock) creating
a memory trace, the consequences of which are that the
neutral stimulus elicits the learned fear response. Consider-
able evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that LTP at
sensory inputs to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala is
necessary and perhaps sufficient for establishing this
engram (Sigurdsson et al, 2007). NMDAR-dependent LTP
can be induced at cortical and thalamic inputs into the
lateral amygdala, both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, fear
conditioning induces synaptic potentiation at these sy-
napses, and this increase in synaptic strength occludes
further induction of LTP (McKernan and Shinnick-Galla-
gher, 1997; Rogan et al, 1997; Tsvetkov et al, 2002). Like
NMDAR-dependent LTP in the hippocampus, fear con-
ditioning has also been shown to lead to the insertion of
new AMPARs at thalamic input synapses onto lateral
amygdala neurons (Rumpel et al, 2005) and perhaps most
convincingly, expression of a peptide that prevents the LTP-
induced incorporation of AMPARs at synapses abolished
acquisition of this form of associative memory (Rumpel
et al, 2005).
NMDARs in the amgydala are also involved in the
extinction of learned fear, which can be conceptualized as a
different form of learning (Myers and Davis, 2002).
Furthermore, acute treatment with D-cycloserine, a partial
agonist of NMDARs, enhances the learning processes that
are responsible for fear extinction via actions in the
amygdala (Walker et al, 2002). On the basis of these
observations, clinical trials have been initiated using D-
cycloserine in combination with behavioral therapy to
enhance the extinction of fear in phobic patients (Hofmann
et al, 2006; Otto et al, 2007; Ressler et al, 2004). Results to
date suggest that the administration of D-cycloserine either
before or shortly after exposure to fearful cues does in fact
enhance the extinction of the anxiety previously associated
with specific cues. Thus, the study of the neural substrates
of learned fear and its extinction is a compelling example of
how research on the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity has
directly led to a potential novel treatment for common
psychiatric disorders.
Synaptic Plasticity in Dopamine Circuits
The defining characteristic of drug addiction is persistent
and compulsive seeking and ingestion of drugs despite
adverse consequences. Over the last decade, a leading
hypothesis has been that an important neural substrate
of
addiction,
in
particular
relapse,
is
long-term
associative memory processes occurring in several neural
circuits
that
receive
input
from
midbrain
dopamine
neurons (Everitt and Robbins, 2005; Hyman et al, 2006).
In other words, it is thought that addictive drugs can usurp
the normal adaptive mechanisms underlying reward-based
learning.
The most well-established key site of action of addictive
drugs is the mesolimbic dopamine system consisting of the
VTA and the NAc. Excitatory synaptic transmission in these
structures is critical for mediating several forms of long-
lasting, drug-induced behavioral plasticity (Everitt and
Wolf, 2002; Hyman and Malenka, 2001). It, therefore, has
been reasonable to hypothesize that plasticity at these
synapses plays an important role in mediating some of the
behavioral consequences of exposure to drugs of abuse
(Wolf, 1998).
Indeed, it is now established that various forms of LTP
and LTD can be elicited at excitatory synapses in the VTA
and NAc (Gerdeman et al, 2003; Kauer, 2004; Kelley, 2004;
Thomas and Malenka, 2003). Furthermore, administration
of a single dose of several different classes of drugs of abuse
causes
a significant increase
in synaptic strength at
excitatory synapses onto dopamine cells in the VTA (Faleiro
et al, 2004; Saal et al, 2003; Ungless et al, 2001). This
increase shares mechanisms with LTP in the VTA and
appears to involve upregulation of AMPARs (Ungless et al,
2001). This drug-induced ‘LTP’ appears to play a functional
role in triggering or mediating some drug-induced beha-
vioral adaptations, as both conditioned place preference
and behavioral sensitization are blocked by injection of
glutamate receptor antagonists into the VTA (Harris and
Aston-Jones, 2003; Vanderschuren and Kalivas, 2000). In
addition, conditioned place preference, as well as the
synaptic potentiation that is observed following cocaine
administration, are impaired in GluR1 knockout mice
(Dong et al, 2004), with the caveat that these mice still
exhibit robust behavioral sensitization in response to
repeated exposure to psychostimulants (Dong et al, 2004;
Vekovischeva et al, 2001).
While drugs of abuse have been observed to induce LTP
in the VTA, LTD has been observed in the NAc following
chronic in vivo cocaine administration (Thomas et al,
2001). Consistent with a functional role for this LTD in
addiction, injection of glutamate receptor antagonists into
the NAc abolishes the expression of behavioral sensitization
(Kelley, 2004). Furthermore, amphetamine-induced beha-
vioral sensitization and LTD in the NAc were both abolished
by injection into the NAc of inhibitors of AMPAR
endocytosis (Brebner et al, 2005). Interestingly, overexpres-
sion of GluR1 in the NAc (mimicking an ‘LTP’-like
condition) facilitates the extinction of cocaine-seeking
(Sutton et al, 2003) and even makes cocaine aversive in a
conditioned place preference assay (Kelz et al, 1999).
Recently, it has also been reported that cocaine self-
administration abolishes the ability to induce LTD in the

and
in
vivo
administration
of
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cocaine impairs the gene-
ration of eCB-LTD (Fourgeaud et al, 2004; Mato et al, 2004;
Robbe et al, 2002b). Thus, drugs of abuse may elicit certain
forms of synaptic plasticity in specific circuits while
simultaneously impairing plasticity in other circuits.
Synaptic plasticity in the dorsal striatum has also been
correlated with certain learned behaviors, in particular in
motor control (Gubellini et al, 2004; Pisani et al, 2005). In
this context, it is important to note that two independent
striatal circuits are thought to exist, the so-called ‘direct’
and ‘indirect’ pathways, which subserve different functions
in motor control (Bolam et al, 2000). Indirect pathway
medium spiny neurons (MSNs) project to the lateral globus
pallidus and primarily express D2 dopamine receptors while
direct pathway MSNs project to the substantia nigra and
express D1 dopamine receptors. As mentioned in the
section on eCB-LTD, this form of plasticity is primarily
restricted to the indirect pathway MSNs and is absent in
Parkinson’s disease models (Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007).
However,
in
slices
from
dopamine-depleted
animals,
indirect pathway eCB-LTD can be rescued by a D2 receptor
agonist or pharmacological inhibitors of endocannabinoid
degradation. Remarkably, administration of these drugs
together in vivo dramatically reduces Parkinsonian motor
deficits suggesting that endocannabinoid-mediated depres-
sion of indirect pathway synapses has a critical role in
motor control and may be a valuable target for therapy of
striatal-based brain disorders (Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007).
This works also points out the potential power of examining
the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and placing them in
the context of the neural circuits in which they are found.
Future Directions
We have attempted to briefly review the enormous field of
synaptic plasticity research in a concise and accessible
manner so that by the end of this article, readers will have a
reasonably up to date knowledge of current thinking about
the mechanisms underlying the major forms of synaptic
plasticity in the mammalian brain and a sense of what their
in vivo functions might be. By necessity we have had to
leave out important topics such as how synaptic activity
modulates NMDAR-mediated synaptic responses (eg, Mor-
ishita et al, 2005), inhibitory synaptic responses (Chevaleyre
et al, 2006), or the intrinsic excitability of neurons (Xu and
Kang, 2005; Zhang and Linden, 2003), all of which will have
profound effects on neural circuit function. Furthermore,
several
compelling
examples
that
correlate
long-term
synaptic plasticity with experience-dependent modifications
in behavior have been left out, such as the role of cerebellar
LTD in motor learning (Boyden et al, 2004; Ito, 2002;
Jorntell and Hansel, 2006).
This review should also make clear that while extensive
progress has been made, much remains unknown. Even for
the most established forms of plasticity, NMDAR-depen-
dent LTP and LTD in the CA1 region of the hippocampus,
we
still
know
little
about
the
details
of
the
signal
transduction pathways triggering these forms of plasticity
and which specific proteins are being modified to cause the
changes in synaptic efficacy. We also know little about the
molecular mechanisms underlying the structural changes in
synapses that seem to accompany LTP and LTD. With the
accumulation of evidence demonstrating that long-term
synaptic modifications do in fact play important roles in a
host of adaptive brain functions, we believe there is strong
justification to continue efforts toward establishing the
detailed molecular basis of the various forms of synaptic
plasticity. This is particularly important because, as we have
tried to make clear, such knowledge is likely to have a major
impact on our understanding and treatment of a wide range
of brain disorders.
What direction do we envision the field taking in the near
future? By definition, synaptic plasticity is an electrophy-
siological phenomenon. Only by recording synaptic re-
sponses can the investigator be sure that synaptic function
has been modified. Until relatively recently, most electro-
physiological studies depended on pharmacological manip-
ulations of proteins, an approach that was aided by the use
of genetically modified mice. Thus far, gene knockout
experiments addressing the function of B200 genes have
been reported and close to 80% of these report effects on
synaptic transmission or plasticity (Grant, 2006). With the
growing consensus that NMDAR-dependent LTP is primar-
ily mediated by an increase in postsynaptic AMPARs, while
LTD is associated with loss of AMPARs from the PSD, there
also has been an increased contribution of cell biologists
who have focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying
the changes in the levels of postsynaptic receptors as well as
the changes in synaptic structure that occur. Indeed, a close
interdependence has emerged between electrophysiologists
and cell biologists and this has dramatically impacted the
field. Thus, electrophysiologists are increasingly making use
of tools that enable overexpression, knockdown, and
molecular replacement of target proteins both in vitro and
in vivo (eg, Schluter et al, 2006). These advances are
enabling a true molecular dissection of the mechanisms
underlying plasticity of mammalian brain synapses.
Recent advances in high-throughput technologies, such as
gene-chip microarrays for mRNA profiling and advanced
mass spectrometry for identification of multiple proteins in
a mixed population, have enabled the identification of the
molecular components of many biological phenomena and
contributed significantly to understanding their regulation.
Furthermore, the recent advent of ‘systems biology’ has
contributed a number of conceptual advances that enable
clearer interpretation of the complex interaction networks
observed in signal transduction cascades (Alon, 2006).
These advances have so far only lightly impacted the field of
synaptic plasticity (Pocklington et al, 2006), but we envision
that they will have increasing influence in the near future,
despite the technical difficulties that are encountered when
trying to apply these approaches to the inherently complex
preparations used in the study of synaptic plasticity.
What might we gain from such studies? A clearer picture
of the molecules which participate in the processes under-
lying the different forms of synaptic plasticity, and the
dynamics of their activation and interactions, would enable
the formulation of much more sophisticated models of the
events underlying the triggering, expression, and main-
tenance of specific forms of synaptic plasticity. This in turn
would create a strong foundation for focused efforts aimed
at identifying the central pathways mediating synaptic

plasticity and assaying their relevance to the phenomenon
measured electrophysiologically.
By combining electrophysiological, molecular, cell biolo-
gical and proteomic approaches, we envision that the next
few decades will bring further clarification of the detailed
molecular mechanisms underlying the major forms of
synaptic plasticity that we have discussed in this review.
The use of more sophisticated molecular and genetic
manipulations, in particular, the development of mouse
lines with highly restricted expression of transgenes that
can be turned on or off with fine temporal control, will
simultaneously facilitate the examination of the neural
circuit basis of behavior. Together, we believe these
approaches will allow sophisticated manipulation of synap-
tic plasticity mechanisms in highly restricted neural circuits
and thereby greatly advance our understanding of how
synaptic plasticity mediates both adaptive and pathological
experience-dependent plasticity. Applying these same ap-
proaches to disease models should yield new insights into
the molecular pathology of diseases of the synapse such as
addiction, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s diseases and also
pave the way toward the development of novel and more
efficacious treatments.

Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) infiltrate adipose tissue during obesity and contribute to insulin resis-
tance. We hypothesized that macrophages migrating to adipose tissue upon high-fat feeding may differ from 
those that reside there under normal diet conditions. To this end, we found a novel F4/80+CD11c+ population 
of ATMs in adipose tissue of obese mice that was not seen in lean mice. ATMs from lean mice expressed many 
genes characteristic of M2 or “alternatively activated” macrophages, including Ym1, arginase 1, and Il10. Diet-
induced obesity decreased expression of these genes in ATMs while increasing expression of genes such as 
those encoding TNF-α and iNOS that are characteristic of M1 or “classically activated” macrophages. Interest-
ingly, ATMs from obese C-C motif chemokine receptor 2–KO (Ccr2-KO) mice express M2 markers at levels similar 
to those from lean mice. The antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10, which was overexpressed in ATMs from lean 
mice, protected adipocytes from TNF-α–induced insulin resistance. Thus, diet-induced obesity leads to a shift 
in the activation state of ATMs from an M2-polarized state in lean animals that may protect adipocytes from 
inflammation to an M1 proinflammatory state that contributes to insulin resistance.
Introduction
Recent investigations suggest that obesity gives rise to a state 
of chronic, low-grade inflammation that contributes to insulin 
resistance and type 2 diabetes (1, 2). Although the tissues and cell 
types involved in this inflammatory response are not fully under-
stood, there is significant interest in the role of adipose tissue 
macrophages (ATMs) in the inflammatory changes characteristic 
of obesity (3). In both humans and rodents, ATMs accumulate 
in adipose tissue with increasing body weight and their quantity 
correlates with measures of insulin resistance (4–6). In obese sub-
jects, ATM content is higher in visceral than subcutaneous adi-
pose tissue, consistent with the hypothesis that visceral fat plays 
a more prominent role in insulin resistance (7). Moreover, weight 
loss leads to a reduction in both inflammatory markers and ATM 
content (4, 7). ATMs are a prominent source of proinflammatory 
cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 that can block insulin action in 
adipocytes, providing a potential link between inflammation and 
insulin resistance (6, 8).
Mouse models have demonstrated that ATMs are both neces-
sary and sufficient for the development of insulin resistance with 
obesity. Mice with targeted deletions in the genes for monocyte 
chemoattractant protein–1 (Mcp1/Ccl2) and its receptor C-C motif 
chemokine receptor 2 (Ccr2) both have decreased ATM content, 
decreased inflammation in fat, and protection from high-fat 
diet–induced (HFD-induced) insulin resistance (9, 10). Converse-
ly, mice overexpressing MCP-1 have increased numbers of ATMs 
along with increased insulin resistance (9, 11). Moreover, myeloid-
specific KO of IκB kinase β (Ikbkb) produced mice with improved 
insulin sensitivity on HFD (12). Together, these data suggest that 
both the recruitment and proinflammatory activation of ATMs 
are required for the development of diabetes with obesity.
While quantitative changes in ATM content with obesity and 
diabetes are well supported, little is known about the range of 
ATM function and how this may change with obesity. ATMs are 
present in moderate quantities in adipose tissue of lean mice 
in which inflammatory signals are low or nonexistent (5, 6), 
and their role there is unclear. While Ccr2-KO (CCR2KO) and 
Mcp1-KO mice have lower inflammatory cytokine expression 
in fat, they retain significant macrophage content within adi-
pose tissue (9, 10). This suggests that factors both dependent 
and independent of the MCP-1/CCR2 axis are involved in mac-
rophage recruitment to fat and, further, that not all ATMs are 
programmed for proinflammatory signaling.
Macrophages show significant heterogeneity in function, as local 
environmental factors shape their properties and activation state 
(13, 14). Different stimuli activate macrophages to express distinct 
patterns of chemokines, surface markers, and metabolic enzymes 
that ultimately generate the diversity of macrophage function seen 
in inflammatory and noninflammatory settings. Macrophage acti-
vation has been operationally defined across 2 separate polarization 
states, M1 and M2 (13, 14). These states have largely been defined 
in vitro, and tissue macrophages are likely activated along a con-
tinuum between these states in vivo. M1 or “classically activated” 
macrophages are induced by proinflammatory mediators such as 
LPS and IFN-γ. M1 macrophages have enhanced proinflammatory 
cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12) and generate reactive oxy-
gen species such as NO via activation of iNOS (Nos2).
M2 or “alternatively activated” macrophages are generated in 
vitro by exposure to IL-4 and IL-13 (15). M2 macrophages have 
low proinflammatory cytokine expression and instead generate 
high levels of antiinflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-1 decoy 
receptor. Additionally, arginase production is increased in M2-
polarized macrophages. This enzyme blocks iNOS activity by a 
variety of mechanisms, including competing for the arginine sub-
strate that is required for NO production (16). Overall, M2 mac-

rophages are believed to participate in the blockade of inflam-
matory responses and in the promotion of tissue repair (13). M2 
polarization can occur in the absence of IL-4 or IL-13, suggesting 
that this state may be induced by several different factors (17). 
Moreover, recent studies have shown that IL-4–mediated M2 
polarization is associated with the activation of transcription fac-
tors involved in lipid oxidative metabolism that include PPARγ 
and PPARγ coactivator 1β (PGC-1β) (18).
In mice, distinct monocyte subsets contribute to tissue inflam-
matory responses (13, 19). Noninflamed tissues are populated 
with macrophages derived from CX3CR1hiCCR2– monocytes 
(20). In contrast, acute inflammation increases the levels of 
CX3CR1loCCR2+Ly-6Chi monocytes, which have a higher capac-
ity for migration into inflamed tissues compared with other 
monocyte populations (21). This model is consistent with obser-
vations that CCR2KO mice have decreased ATM content (10), 
presumably due to deficient recruitment of CX3CR1loCCR2+ 
monocytes with retention of the trafficking of CX3CR1hiCCR2– 
monocytes into adipose tissue.
The qualitative differences between these monocyte/macrophage 
subtypes in ATMs and obesity are unknown but may be impor-
tant in understanding the biology of these unique cells and their 
contribution to diabetes. In this regard, we show here that ATMs 
undergo a phenotypic switch from an antiinflammatory M2 polar-
ization state to a proinflammatory M1 polarization state upon 
high-fat feeding, in the process losing their protective capacity.
Results
F4/80+CD11b+CD11c+ macrophages accumulate in fat with diet-induced 
obesity. As the majority of previous studies have used F4/80 expres-
sion as a single marker to identify ATMs, we sought to examine 
ATM heterogeneity in lean and obese mice using additional known 
macrophage markers. Epididymal fat tissue plays a significant role 
in overall metabolism in rodents (22). We thus isolated stromal 
vascular fraction (SVF) cells from epididymal fat pads excised from 
male mice fed a normal diet (ND) or HFD and analyzed cells by 
flow cytometry. ATMs from both lean and obese mice coexpressed 
F4/80 and CD11b, and the majority of the F4/80+CD11b+ cells 
also expressed Mac-3 (data not shown). However, there was varia-
tion in the amount of CD11c expression within the F4/80+CD11b+ 
ATMs. The SVF from lean mice contained 17.8% F4/80+ cells, con-
sistent with other reports (5). Only a small percentage of these cells 
coexpressed CD11c (9.3% ± 7.5%; n = 3 pools of mice) (Figure 1A). 
In contrast, obese mice contained increased F4/80+ cell content 
within the SVF, with a significant increase in the percentage of 
F4/80+CD11c+ cells (38.4% ± 15% of F4/80+ cells; P = 0.04 versus 
lean mice). These cells also expressed CD11b. Similar results were 
seen in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, with 74% of the F4/80+ cells 
coexpressing CD11c (data not shown).

and F4/80+CD11c– cells (1.98 ± 0.42 × 106 cells/mouse versus

fat pads increased in mice fed an HFD compared with lean mice 
(Figure 1B). Normalizing this data to fat pad weight indicated 
that there was a 5.5-fold increase in the content of F4/80+CD11c+ 
cells in adipose tissue from HFD-fed compared with ND mice 
(Figure 1C). In contrast, there was no significant change in the 
quantity of F4/80+CD11c– cells in adipose tissue per milligram 
fat weight between ND and HFD mice. This demonstrates that 
F4/80+CD11c+ cells are a specific population of ATMs recruited 
to fat tissue upon HFD exposure.
Previous studies indicated that targeted deletion of the Ccr2 gene 
results in decreased macrophage content in adipose tissue and 
improved insulin sensitivity (10). Thus, CCR2KO mice were also 
examined for CD11c expression as a complementary mouse model. 
HFD-fed CCR2KO mice demonstrated a reduction in the content 
of F4/80+CD11c+ cells in the SVF compared with wild-type obese 
mice, with 14.4% ± 9.2% of the F4/80+ cells coexpressing CD11c 
(P = 0.08 versus HFD C57BL/6) (Figure 1D). Normalizing for cell 
number and fat weight indicated that there was a greater than 50% 
reduction in the level of F4/80+CD11c+ ATMs in the CCR2KO mice 
(HFD C57BL/6, 2.4 ± 0.46 × 103 cells/mg versus HFD CCR2KO, 
0.88 ± 0.98 × 103 cells/mg) (Figure 1C). The content of total 
F4/80+CD11c+ cells in fat pads from HFD CCR2KO mice was also 
lower than in obese controls after normalization to cell number 
(Figure 1B). Similar to what was observed previously (10), adipo-
cyte size was increased in HFD CCR2KO mice compared with con-
trol HFD mice (mean 7,933 ± 2,754 μm2 versus 6,704 ± 2,961 μm2,  
P = 0.041) and HFD CCR2KO mice were protected from hepatic 
steatosis (data not shown). Contrary to these observations, how-
ever, we noted increased fat pad weight in HFD CCR2KO mice  
(2.83 ± 0.57 g versus control, 1.41 ± 0.25 g; P = 0.011).
Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed the flow cytometry 
results; ND SVF cultures contained only F4/80+CD11c– cells (Fig-
ure 2A). SVF cells from HFD mice showed a mix of F4/80+CD11c+ 
and F4/80+CD11c– cells. Immunohistochemistry on epididymal 
fat pads from obese mice localized CD11c+ cells in macrophage 
clusters surrounding adipocytes (Figure 2B). The CD11c antibody 
stained a subset of cells in these crownlike structures, while F4/80 
stained nearly all of the cells in these clusters. Scattered individual 
CD11c+ ATMs were observed surrounding adipocytes in what may 
have been early ATM clusters (Figure 2C). Rare CD11c+ cells were 
seen in adipose tissue sections from lean mice.
Increased inflammatory gene expression in F4/80+CD11c+ ATMs. 
Because CD11c+ cells appear to accumulate in adipose tissue after 
high-fat feeding, we assessed expression of inflammatory genes in 
F4/80+CD11c+ ATMs compared with F4/80+CD11c– ATMs from 
obese mice. Real-time RT-PCR showed appropriate sorting of the 
CD11c populations based on expression of integrin, alpha X (Itgax, 
encoding CD11c) (Figure 3). F4/80+CD11c+ cells overexpressed 
the inflammatory genes Il6 (IL-6) and Nos2 (iNOS) compared with 
F4/80+CD11c– ATMs. Tnfa (TNF-α) was not differentially expressed 
between the cell types, while Apoe (apoE) was downregulated in the 
F4/80+CD11c+ population relative to F4/80+CD11c– cells.
ATMs from lean mice express markers of alternatively activated mac-
rophages. Given the low level of inflammatory cytokine expression 
in adipose tissue from lean mice, we examined the ATMs derived 
from lean mice for known markers of alternatively activated M2

macrophages (15, 23). ATMs from lean animals showed increased 
expression of M2-specific genes Il10 (IL-10), Arg1 (arginase I), Mrc2 
(mannose receptor, C type 2), Ym1/Chi3l3 (Ym1/chitinase 3–like 3),  
and Mgl1/2 (macrophage galactose N-acetyl-galactosamine–spe-
cific lectins 1 and 2) compared with the ATMs isolated from HFD 
mice (Figure 4A). In contrast, expression of proinflammatory 
genes such as Tnfa and Nos2 was considerably lower in ND ATMs 
compared with ATMs from obese animals (Figure 4B).
As macrophages make up only a portion of the stromal cells in 
adipose tissue, we examined expression of some of these genes in 
unsorted SVF isolates. Similar patterns of gene expression were 
seen in RNA prepared from SVF cells from lean and obese mice 
(Figure 4, C and D), with increased Ym1 and Il10 expression in ND 
mice and increased Tnfa and Nos2 expression in HFD mice.
Since inflammatory macrophage recruitment into fat tissue 
appears to be partially dependent on CCR2 (10), we hypothesized 
that ATMs in obese CCR2KO mice might retain properties of 
M2-polarized macrophages and thus evaluated gene expression 
in these cells. Indeed, ATMs isolated from obese CCR2KO mice 
expressed alternatively activated macrophage markers at levels that 
were similar to those seen in ATMs from lean mice. Furthermore, 
these were significantly elevated compared with levels in ATMs 
from obese mice (Figure 4A).
We confirmed gene expression data by examining protein lev-
els in the ATMs under study. Consistent with the RNA expression 
data, Ym1 was increased in SVF samples from lean compared with 
obese mice (Figure 4E). Additionally, purification of CD11b+ ATMs 
from SVF samples indicated that Ym1 is predominantly expressed 
in ATMs compared with non-macrophage CD11b– cells.
Another characteristic of the alternative macrophage activa-
tion state is increased arginase activity (15). Arginase activity was 
assessed in SVF and adipocyte samples from lean and obese mice. 
While the activity of this enzyme did not differ between the iso-
lated adipocytes from lean and obese mice, arginase activity was 
significantly diminished in the SVF fraction after HFD exposure 
(Figure 4F). This indicates that the arginase/iNOS balance in 
ATMs from lean animals is skewed toward an immunosuppres-
sive state that changes to a proinflammatory state with obesity 
(elevated iNOS and repressed arginase activity).
IL-10 protects adipocytes from the deleterious effects of TNF-α. The 
observation that the expression of Il10 is higher in the SVF and 
ATMs from lean compared with obese mice led us to examine the 
effects of the cytokine on adipocyte function. To explore the cellu-
lar effects of IL-10, we first examined the expression of its receptor. 
The IL-10 receptor α (IL-10Rα) was detected in adipose tissue by 
immunoblotting (Figure 5A). Separation of the SVF from adipo-
cytes in lean and obese animals indicated that the IL-10 receptor 
was expressed primarily in adipocytes, with minimal expression 
in the SVF (Figure 5B). No significant differences were seen in  
IL-10Rα expression between lean and obese mice.
We next examined IL-10 signaling in differentiated 3T3-L1 adi-
pocytes. STAT3 phosphorylation by the IL-10 receptor has been 
shown to be required for its antiinflammatory effects (24). Treat-
ment of adipocytes with IL-10 led to the tyrosine phosphorylation 
of STAT3 within 5 minutes. This effect peaked at 10 minutes and 
declined thereafter (Figure 5C). As IL-10 as been shown to activate 
the PI3K pathway via insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins (25), 
we examined phosphorylation of Akt in response to IL-10. IL-10 
treatment of adipocytes produced the rapid serine phosphoryla-
tion of Akt (Figure 5C).
IL-10 has a variety of antiinflammatory effects in macrophages 
and other cell types that includes the antagonism of the actions of 
TNF-α (26). To examine this in adipocytes, we first analyzed the 
effect of IL-10 on the secretion of the chemokine MCP-1, thought 
to be a major attractant for macrophages in states of obesity (9, 
11, 27). IL-10 treatment for 16 hours decreased MCP-1 secretion 
from adipocytes (Figure 6A). As reports suggest that IL-10 may 
mediate its antiinflammatory effects by antagonizing activation 
of NF-κB–mediated gene transcription (28), we examined the 
effects of IL-10 on TNF-α–stimulated NF-κB activity using an 
NF-κB–responsive luciferase reporter gene. While TNF-α induced 
reporter gene expression, IL-10 had no effect upon this activation 
(data not shown). This is consistent with other reports that show 
that IL-10 can alter the transcriptional rate of inflammatory genes 
independent of NF-κB activation (29).
We next examined the effects of IL-10 on insulin signal 
transduction in adipocytes in concert with TNF-α. Treatment 
of cells with TNF-α for 6 hours dramatically reduced the levels 
of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) protein, with a smaller reduc-
tion in the level of insulin receptor expression, similar to what has 
been reported previously (30). IL-10 pretreatment prevented the 
TNF-α–induced downregulation of both proteins (Figure 6B). 
Additionally, insulin-stimulated IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation 
was decreased with TNF-α treatment. This inhibitory effect was 
prevented by pretreatment with IL-10 (Figure 6C). IL-10 treat-
ment produced no significant changes in TNF-α–stimulated IRS1 
phosphorylation at Ser307, suggesting that the antagonism of  
TNF-α action by IL-10 occurs either downstream of or in parallel 
to reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1.
To determine whether IL-10 protects adipocytes from the physi-
ological effects of TNF-α, we examined insulin-stimulated glucose 
uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with and without IL-10 pretreatment. 
Treatment of cells with TNF-α for 3 hours produced a significant, 
30%–40% inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Pre-
treatment of the cells with IL-10 for 24 hours blocked these acute 
inhibitory effects of TNF-α (Figure 7A). Prolonged (72-hour), low-
dose TNF-α treatment increased basal glucose uptake but had no 
effect on insulin-stimulated levels, consistent with a dramatic

ditions (31). IL-10 blocked these effects of TNF-α and maintained 
cells in an insulin-sensitive state (Figure 7B). Moreover, insulin-
stimulated glucose uptake was dramatically enhanced in cells 
chronically treated with IL-10 compared with untreated cells.
Discussion
Recent data suggest that obesity may represent a state of chron-
ic, low-grade inflammation and that overnutrition is associated 
with the infiltration of adipose tissue by inflammatory cells (2). 
Although the precise cell types involved in this process remain 
uncertain, evidence is mounting that implicates ATMs as a sig-
nificant contributor to inflammation in obesity and a mediator 
of insulin resistance (3, 9, 32). Because the properties of ATMs are 
not well characterized, we performed a detailed examination of 
ATM subtypes and their gene expression in obese and lean mice. 
Based on the wide range of functions that macrophages display in 
normal and inflamed tissues (33), we hypothesized that ATMs are 
differentially activated depending on the degree of adiposity and, 
further, that in addition to quantitative differences, qualitative 
differences exist between ATMs in lean and obese animals.
We report here that ATMs isolated from white adipose tissue 
from lean animals express hallmarks of polarization toward an 
alternatively activated state (M2), suggesting a potentially ben-
eficial function of these cells. M2 polarization has been described 
in tumor-associated macrophages and parasitic infections and is 
believed to regulate tissue repair and prevent excess inflammation 
(15, 34). The markers of M2-polarized macrophages are still being 
described but include expression of the chitinase family member 
Ym1, the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10, arginase, and surface 
lectins Mgl1 and Mgl2 (15, 23). The genes encoding all of these pro-
teins were overexpressed in ATMs from lean compared with obese 
mice. Moreover, ATMs from obese CCR2KO mice, which display 
significantly lower inflammatory gene expression compared with 
their wild-type counterparts, express M2 markers at levels compa-
rable to those in lean mice. This observation is consistent with the 
evidence that resident tissue macrophages in normal conditions 
are derived from CCR2– monocytes, while macrophages recruited 
to sites of inflammation are derived from CCR2+ monocytes (20).
In the current paradigm of macrophage polarization, the prop-
erties of M2 macrophages contrast with the proinflammatory 
activities of classically activated M1 macrophages. One important 
difference between these polarization states involves the balance 
between arginase and iNOS activities. Arginase and iNOS both uti-
lize l-arginine as a substrate. However, while iNOS generates reac-
tive NO species with microbicidal and proinflammatory effects 
important in immune responses, arginase competes with iNOS for 
arginine as a substrate and generates l-ornithine, an important 
precursor for proline that enhances collagen biosynthesis (16).

Based both on gene expression analysis and direct measurement 
of activity, ATMs from lean mice exhibit enhanced arginase activ-
ity compared with obese mice. This balance in favor of arginase 
may play a critical role in repressing the generation of NO and 
other reactive oxygen species by iNOS and thus maintain adipo-
cyte function and promote tissue repair and remodeling.
The dramatic differences in IL-10 expression in lean compared 
with obese ATMs imply an important role for this cytokine as a 
homeostatic regulator in insulin sensitivity. Acute IL-10 infusion 
was shown to improve insulin sensitivity in whole animals (35), 
suggesting that this molecule may balance the effects of proin-
flammatory cytokines such as TNF-α. In humans, circulating IL-10  
levels correlate with markers of improved insulin sensitivity (36), 
and IL-10 levels increase along with insulin sensitivity after exer-
cise (37). Polymorphisms in the IL-10 promoter associated with low 
IL-10 expression are correlated with increased obesity and insulin 
resistance (38). Additionally, adiponectin has been shown to induce  
IL-10 expression in human leukocytes (39). Studies have also shown 
that in obese humans and rodents, both adipocyte and SVF com-
partments from adipose tissue are significant sources of IL-10 (40). 
As levels of proinflammatory cytokines are increased in obesity, 
this observation is consistent with the hypothesis that a balance 
exists between proinflammatory and antiinflamma-
tory factors that governs adipocyte function.
In vitro studies described here show that IL-10 
protects against TNF-α–dependent insulin resis-
tance in adipocytes. The mechanism underlying 
this effect remains uncertain. In macrophages,  
IL-10 attenuates TNF-α inflammatory signals via 
activation of STAT3 (24) and modulation of inflam-
matory gene transcription rates (29). We have not 
observed changes in TNF-α–stimulated NF-κB acti-
vation with IL-10 in adipocytes, although we did 
observe increased PI3K signaling with the cytokine. 
This observation agrees with previous reports that 
IL-10 can activate PI3K pathways via IRS (25) and 
suggests a possible mechanism by which IL-10 can 
antagonize the deleterious effects of TNF-α on 
insulin signaling in adipocytes.
Obesity leads to a shift in ATM phenotype exem-
plified by increased Tnfa and Nos2 expression, 
both characteristically activated in classically acti-
vated M1 macrophages (4–6). We have identified a 
unique subset of ATMs present only in obese animals that express 
F4/80+CD11b+CD11c+. These cells overexpress inflammatory 
genes compared with F4/80+CD11b+CD11c– ATMs and are the 
major ATM population that accumulates in fat with diet-induced 
obesity. These studies indicate a previously uncharacterized diver-
sity within the ATM population in obese mice that may have 
important functional consequences.
CD11c is a marker for DCs, which primarily function in 
phagocytosis, immune surveillance, and antigen presentation. 
F4/80+CD11c+ DCs have been termed interstitial dendritic cells; 
they were recently described in a kidney network that is believed 
to participate in immune surveillance (41). How these DCs par-
ticipate in inflammatory signals in adipose tissue is unknown. 
It is possible that DC activation is critical to the coordination of 
inflammatory events within fat tissue. An important role for DCs 
in obese adipose tissue is supported by the decreased expression of 
MHC class II genes in CCR2KO mice relative to controls (10). More-

over, we have observed an increased expression of MHC class II  
genes in ATMs specifically recruited to adipose tissue with HFD 
(42). These data suggest that DC-coordinated immunity may be 
crucial to the inflammatory events in adipose tissue that occur 
with obesity. Why such DCs are activated and what antigens they 
respond to is currently unknown.
Examining ATM infiltration into adipose tissue in the context 
of monocyte and macrophage heterogeneity leads us to propose 
a model for ATM biology that incorporates the diversity of these 
cells (Figure 8). In lean animals, resident macrophages are polar-
ized toward an M2 state (high IL-10 and arginase levels) derived 
from CCR2– monocytes that help maintain normal adipocyte 
function, perhaps by promoting tissue repair and angiogenesis in 
adipose tissue. Nutrient excess leads to adipocyte expansion, with 
increased secretion of monocyte chemoattractants that recruit 
inflammatory type CCR2+ monocytes to fat, where they differen-
tiate into M1-polarized activated macrophages and CD11c+ DCs. 
Alternatively activated M2 macrophages may be able to partially 
prevent the activation and accumulation of these classically acti-
vated M1 macrophages (43, 44), and the secretion of IL-10 helps 
protect adipocytes against the deleterious effects of TNF-α and 
related cytokines. However, with increasing adiposity, increased 
proinflammatory signals, continued recruitment of M1-polarized 
CCR2+ monocytes, and accumulation of CD11c+ ATMs all con-
tribute to overwhelm the protective effects of M2 macrophages, 
leading to a dominant role for M1-polarized, classically activated 
macrophages that generate high TNF-α, IL-6, and NO production. 
This model explains observations in obese CCR2KO and Mcp1/
Ccl2-KO mice that retain a population of ATMs with decreased 
inflammatory capacity (9, 10). We suspect that these KOs are 
deficient in the recruitment of CCR2+ monocytes during inflam-
mation in fat tissue, while the trafficking of CCR2– monocytes 
with M2 polarization remains intact. Studies aimed at determin-
ing whether enhancing M2 polarization in ATMs can block diet-
induced insulin resistance will be required in order to test this 
model. One limitation of the data leading to this model is that 
they are largely based on flow cytometric analysis of isolated SVF 
populations after collagenase digestion. This method of separa-
tion is an efficient one but may not fully capture all stromal cells 
from adipose tissue (5).
How diet-induced obesity leads to a change from M2 to M1 
polarization is currently unknown, but the mechanism is likely 
multifactorial. Our data suggest that the MCP-1/CCR2 axis con-
tributes to this polarization. We propose 2 potential models for 
this qualitative change in ATM activation: (a) Obesity may lead 
to an increase in the level of Ly-6ChiCCR2+ circulating monocytes 
that are primed for activation along an M1 polarization pattern. 
Factors such as MCP-1, TNF-α, and free fatty acids that activate 
TLR4 (45) may combine to influence this activation pattern as 
these monocytes enter adipose tissue. This model is supported 
by observations that obesity is associated with changes in acti-
vation state of circulating monocytes toward a more proinflam-
matory phenotype (46, 47). (b) Alternatively, obesity may change 
ATMs in adipose tissue from an M2 toward an M1 phenotype. 
Macrophages are reported to have the potential to switch from 
one polarization state to another depending upon environmental 
stimuli (48). However, this model depends upon a slow turnover 
of ATMs. Studies involving pulse labeling macrophages in vivo 
indicated that ATMs are largely replaced by 8 weeks in HFD-fed 
mice (42). Additionally, we have observed that the ATMs recruit-
ed to adipose tissue in HFD-fed mice overexpress Ccr2 and other 
proinflammatory mediators. These observations are consistent 
with the first hypothesis, according to which obesity leads to the 
recruitment of M1-polarized macrophages that gradually replace 
M2-polarized cells, which represents the default pathway of acti-
vation under lean conditions.
Our study frames ATM biology within the context of other 
known models of inflammation and macrophage recruitment. It 
may be possible to decrease inflammatory signals in adipose tis-
sue by modifying ATMs to retain an M2 polarization or by con-
verting M1 polarized macrophages to M2. Increasing IL-10 levels 
may represent one mechanism through which this could occur, 
since chronic IL-10 secretion can suppress classically activated M1 
macrophages (49). Future investigations will focus on identifying

factors that trigger the phenotypic switch of macrophage polariza-
tion in fat and whether these changes in polarization state are lim-
ited to fat or are generalizable to macrophages in other tissues.
Methods
Materials and reagents. For immunoblots, anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) and 
IRS1 antibodies were purchased from Upstate USA Inc. β-Actin monoclo-
nal antibody was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. GLUT4 antibodies were 
obtained from Alpha Diagnostics International. STAT3, phosphotyrosine-
STAT3, Akt, and phospho-Akt antibodies were purchased from Cell Signal-
ing Technology. Mouse recombinant TNF-α and IL-10 were obtained from 
Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-CD68, anti–IL-10 receptor α antibodies, and MCP-1  
ELISA kits were purchased from R&D Systems. Anti-F4/80 antibodies 
were from Abcam. Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated CD11b and unconjugated 
CD11c and CD11b antibodies were from AbD Serotec. PE-conjugated 
anti–Mac-3, PE/Cy5-conjugated anti-F4/80, APC-conjugated anti-CD11c, 
and isotype antibodies were purchased from eBioscience. Anti-Ym1 anti-
bodies were purchased from StemCell Technologies.
Animals and animal care. Male C57BL/6 mice were rendered insulin resis-
tant by feeding an HFD consisting of 45% of calories from fat (D12451; 
Research Diets Inc.) starting at 8 weeks of age for 20 weeks or indicated 
times. Control mice were fed a standard diet consisting of 4.5% fat (5002; 
LabDiet). ob/obJ mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. 
CCR2KO mice on a C57BL/6 background were kindly provided by S. Kun-
kel (University of Michigan). Animals were housed in a specific pathogen–
free facility with a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle and given free access 
to food and water. All animal use was in compliance with the Institute of 
Laboratory Animal Research Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory 
Animals and approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of 
Animals at the University of Michigan.
Cell culture. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were propagated and differentiated into 
adipocytes as described previously (50). Adipocytes were used in experi-
ments 8–10 days after differentiation. Adherent SVF cells were cultured on 
plastic or glass coverslips in DMEM supplemented with 10% endotoxin-
free FBS. For signaling experiments, the cells were starved overnight in 
0.5% serum media prior to stimulation with IL-10. For chronic treatment 
with IL-10 (20 ng/ml) and TNF-α (3 ng/mL), adipocyte media was replaced 
with fresh media every 24 hours.
SVF isolation and ATM purification. Epididymal fat pads from male 
C57BL/6 mice fed an ND or HFD were excised and minced in PBS with 
calcium chloride and 0.5% BSA. Tissue suspensions were centrifuged 
at 500 g for 5 minutes to remove erythrocytes and free leukocytes. Col-
lagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to 1 mg/ml and incubated at 37°C 
for 20 minutes with shaking. The cell suspension was filtered through a  
100-μm filter and then spun at 300 g for 5 minutes to separate floating 
adipocytes from the SVF pellet. To ensure proper isolation, adipocyte frac-
tions were examined by microscopy before and after plating on plastic to 
detect adherent cells. Samples were digested until adipocyte fractions were 
free of adherent cells by these 2 quality-control methods to ensure recovery 
of the majority of the SVF population.
For cell culture, the pellet containing the SVF cells was resuspended in 
growth media for further experiments. For flow cytometry, the SVF pellet 
was resuspended in 0.5 ml RBC Lysis Buffer (eBioscience) and incubated 
for 5 minutes prior to resuspension in sorting buffer (PBS with 0.5% endo-
toxin-free FBS, 2 mM EDTA, and 25 mM HEPES) at a concentration of 
107 cells/ml. Cells were incubated with Fc Block (BD Biosciences) prior to 
staining with conjugated antibodies for 15 minutes at 4°C followed by 2 
washes in 10× excess of sorting buffer. Cells were resuspended in sorting 
buffer supplemented with DAPI and then analyzed by FACS (FACSAria; BD 
Biosciences). Viable cells were sorted directly into RNA lysis buffer for RNA 
extraction. ATMs were identified by coexpression of F4/80 and CD11b.
Isolation of CD11b+ cells from SVF isolates was performed by magnetic 
immunoaffinity isolation with anti-CD11b antibodies conjugated to 
magnetic beads (MACS; Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were isolated using positive 
selection columns prior to preparation of whole-cell lysates.
Immunofluorescence staining. For immunofluorescence, SVF cells were plat-
ed onto glass coverslips for 2 hours, and nonadherent cells were removed by 
3 washes with PBS. After 24 hours, the cells were fixed by incubation with 
Figure 8
Proposed model for ATM polarization and its function in adipose tissue with progressive obesity. In lean, insulin-sensitive states, ATMs are polar-
ized toward an M2 state with IL-10 and arginase expression. Early during HFD treatment, adipocytes undergo hypertrophy, releasing chemokines 
that induce recruitment of M1-polarized ATMs with low IL-10 expression and increased iNOS and TNF-α production. In these early stages of mild 
obesity with retained insulin sensitivity, M2-polarized resident ATMs are able to partially protect adipocytes from these inflammatory factors and 
may block M1 polarization. With increased adiposity, recruited CCR2+ ATMs form crownlike structures (CLS) and overwhelm the protective effects 
of M2 macrophages, leading to a dominant role for TNF-α and iNOS. These factors generate insulin resistance in adipocytes, activate JNK and 
NF-κB, alter adipokine secretion, and lead to excess circulating levels of free fatty acids due to adipocyte lipolysis and impaired lipogenesis.

Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates were prepared 
by the addition of lysis buffer (150 mM sodium chloride, 50 mM Tris 
pH 8, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 
10 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium 
orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors [complete Mini tablets; Roche 
Applied Science]). Cells were lysed at 4°C for 30 minutes and clarified by 
centrifugation. For immunoprecipitations, lysates were incubated with 
1 μg of anti-IRS1 antibodies overnight at 4°C and immune complexes 
precipitated with Protein A/G–conjugated beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnol-
ogy Inc.). Beads were washed with lysis buffer and resuspended in sample 
buffer. Lysates and immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, 
transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with primary antibod-
ies followed by species-specific HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. 
HRP activity was detected by chemiluminescence.
Immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded adipose tissue 
sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated prior to antigen unmasking 
by boiling in 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0, with 0.05% Tween-20 for 30 
minutes. Sections were blocked in normal serum and incubated with pri-
mary antibodies for durations of 1 hour to overnight. Endogenous HRP 
activity was quenched with incubation with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 
minutes. Secondary antibody staining was performed using the Vecta-
stain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) and detected with 3,3′-diaminoben-
zidine (DAB). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin prior to 
dehydration and coverslip placement.
2-Deoxyglucose uptake assay. Adipocytes were starved in low-glucose 
DMEM with 0.5% serum for 3 hours prior to insulin stimulation. 2-Deoxy-
glucose uptake assays were performed as previously described (51).
Arginase assay. Arginase activity assays were performed as previously 
described (52). Briefly, cells were lysed in 0.1% Triton X-100. Tris-HCl was 
added to 12.5-mM and MnCl2 added to 1-mM final concentration. Argi-
nase was activated by heating for 10 minutes at 56°C, and l-arginine sub-
strate was added to 250-mM final concentration. Reactions were incubated 
at 37°C for 30 minutes and stopped by the addition of H2SO4/H3PO4. 
After addition of α-isonitrosopropiophenone and heating for 30 minutes 
at 95°C, urea production was measured by absorbance at 540 nm and nor-
malized to total protein content.
NF-κB activation assay. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected with lucifer-
ase reporter plasmid pBIIX-luc (containing 2 tandemly repeated NF-κB 
binding sites) along with Renilla luciferase control (100:1; Promega) as 
previously described (51). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were 
treated with vehicle or TNF-α (1 nM) with or without IL-10 (20 ng/ml) for 
16 hours prior to lysis and analysis using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter 
Assay System (Promega). Values were normalized to Renilla activities.
Statistics. Results are presented as the mean ± 1 SD. Statistical analyses 
were conducted using an unpaired 2-tailed Student’s t test, with signifi-
cance set at a P value of less than 0.05.

Introduction
Macrophages are an essential component of innate immunity and 
play a central role in inflammation and host defense (1). More-
over, these cells fulfill homeostatic functions beyond defense, 
including tissue remodeling in ontogenesis and orchestration of 
metabolic functions (1–3).
Cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage are characterized by 
considerable diversity and plasticity. In tissues, mononuclear phago-
cytes respond to environmental cues (e.g., microbial products, dam-
aged cells, activated lymphocytes) with the acquisition of distinct 
functional phenotypes. In response to various signals, macrophages 
may undergo classical M1 activation (stimulated by TLR ligands and 
IFN-γ) or alternative M2 activation (stimulated by IL-4/IL-13); these 
states mirror the Th1–Th2 polarization of T cells (2, 4).
The M1 phenotype is characterized by the expression of high 
levels of proinflammatory cytokines, high production of reactive 
nitrogen and oxygen intermediates, promotion of Th1 response, 
and strong microbicidal and tumoricidal activity. In contrast, M2 
macrophages are considered to be involved in parasite containment 
and promotion of tissue remodeling and tumor progression and to 
have immunoregulatory functions. They are characterized by effi-
cient phagocytic activity, high expression of scavenging molecules, 
the expression of mannose and galactose receptors, production of 
ornithine and polyamines through the arginase pathway, and an 
IL-12loIL-10hiIL-1decoyRhiIL-1RAhi phenotype (1, 4). M1-M2 mac-
rophages also are distinct in their chemokine expression profiles.
Signals including IL-10, glucocorticoid hormones, molecules 
released from apoptotic cells, and immune complexes also pro-
foundly affect monocyte-macrophage function. These signals induce 
expression of functional phenotypes that share selected properties 
with M2 cells (e.g., high mannose and scavenger receptor expression), 
but are distinct from them, for instance, in terms of the chemokine 
repertoire. Operationally, we refer to these cells as M2 like (5).
Plasticity and flexibility are key features of mononuclear 
phagocytes and of their activation states (2, 4, 6). The pheno-
type of polarized M1-M2 macrophages can, to some extent, be 
reversed in vitro and in vivo (7, 8). Moreover, pathology is fre-
quently associated with dynamic changes in macrophage activa-
tion, with classically activated M1 cells implicated in initiating 
and sustaining inflammation and M2 or M2-like cells associ-
ated with resolution or smoldering chronic inflammation (9). 
It remains unclear whether the mechanism of these switches 
involves the recruitment of circulating precursors or the reeduca-
tion of cells in situ. However, it is now apparent that specialized 
or polarized T cells (Th1, Th2, Tregs) that are key orchestrators 
of macrophage polarized activation (2) also exhibit previously 
unsuspected flexibility and plasticity (10).
Here, we will focus on recent progress in understanding the 
molecular basis underlying macrophage polarization, including 
signaling pathways, transcription factors, and epigenetic regula-
tion. Moreover, the dynamics and limitations in our understand-
ing of polarized macrophage activation in vivo will be discussed, 
focusing on selected pathological conditions (for references to 
pathology not discussed here, see Supplemental References; sup-
plemental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/
JCI59643DS1). Previous reviews also provide a framework for 
this work (1–3, 6, 11).
Molecular determinants of macrophage polarization
A network of signaling molecules, transcription factors, epigenetic 
mechanisms, and posttranscriptional regulators underlies the dif-
ferent forms of macrophage activation. Canonical IRF/STAT sig-
naling pathways are activated by IFNs and TLR signaling to skew 
macrophage function toward the M1 phenotype (via STAT1) or by 
IL-4 and IL-13 to skew toward the M2 phenotype (via STAT6) (3). 
M1 macrophages upregulate IRF5, which is essential for induction 
of cytokines (IL-12, IL-23, TNF) involved in eliciting Th1 and Th17 
responses (12). The IL-4 type I and type II receptors (1, 13) acti-
vate Stat6, which in turn activates transcription of genes typical 
of M2 polarization, e.g., mannose receptor (Mrc1), resistin-like α

Diversity and plasticity are hallmarks of cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. In response to 
IFNs, Toll-like receptor engagement, or IL-4/IL-13 signaling, macrophages undergo M1 (classical) 
or M2 (alternative) activation, which represent extremes of a continuum in a universe of activation 
states. Progress has now been made in defining the signaling pathways, transcriptional networks, 
and epigenetic mechanisms underlying M1-M2 or M2-like polarized activation. Functional skew-
ing of mononuclear phagocytes occurs in vivo under physiological conditions (e.g., ontogenesis 
and pregnancy) and in pathology (allergic and chronic inflammation, tissue repair, infection, and 
cancer). However, in selected preclinical and clinical conditions, coexistence of cells in different activation states 
and unique or mixed phenotypes have been observed, a reflection of dynamic changes and complex tissue-derived 
signals. The identification of mechanisms and molecules associated with macrophage plasticity and polarized acti-
vation provides a basis for macrophage-centered diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

(Retnla, Fizz1), and chitinase 3–like 3 (Chi3l3, Ym1) (14). IL-10 acti-
vates STAT3-mediated expression of genes (Il10, Tgfb1, Mrc1) asso-
ciated with an M2-like phenotype (4, 15, 16).
STAT-mediated activation of macrophages is regulated by mem-
bers of the SOCS family. IL-4 and IFN-γ, the latter in concert with 
TLR stimulation, upregulate SOCS1 and SOCS3, which in turn 
inhibit the action of STAT1 and STAT3, respectively (17, 18).
Downstream of, or in parallel with, the IRF/STAT/SOCS pathway, 
a panel of transcription factors orchestrates polarized macrophage 
activation. The nuclear receptors PPARγ (19) and PPARδ (20, 21) con-
trol distinct subsets of genes associated with M2 macrophage activa-
tion and oxidative metabolism (Figure 1). Interestingly, STAT6 coor-
dinates and synergizes with both PPARγ (22) and Krüppel-like factor 4  
(KLF4), a member of a family of proteins that contribute to macro-
phage function (23, 24). KLF4 cooperates with Stat6 to induce M2 
genes (Arg-1, Mrc1, Fizz1, PPARγ) and inhibit M1 genes (TNFa, Cox-2,  
CCL5, iNOS) via sequestration of coactivators required for NF-κB acti-
vation. KLF2 regulates macrophage activation by inhibiting NF-κB/ 
HIF-1α activities (25). IL-4 also induces c-Myc activity in human 
macrophages (26), which controls genes of M2 activation (Scarb1, 
Alox15, and Mrc1) as well as STAT6 and PPARγ activation (26).
TLR engagement leads to NF-κB activation and production of 
inflammatory mediators (27) associated with M1 macrophages. 
However, NF-κB activation also activates a genetic program essen-
tial for resolution of inflammation (28) and for M2 polarization of 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) (29). Moreover, induction of 
p50 NF-κB homodimers is essential for M2 polarization in vitro and 
in vivo (30). The hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α are 
expressed differentially in M1- and M2-polarized macrophages (31) 
and regulate inducible NOS2 (M1) and arginase 1 (M2), respectively.
Figure 1
Mechanisms of macrophage polarization. The major pathways of macrophage polarization are outlined. The crosstalk between the M1-M2 macro-
phage–polarizing pathways is also indicated. The balance between activation of STAT1 and STAT3/STAT6 finely regulates macrophage polariza-
tion and activity. A predominance of NF-κB and STAT1 activation promotes M1 macrophage polarization, resulting in cytotoxic and inflammatory 
functions. In contrast, a predominance of STAT3 and STAT6 activation results in M2 macrophage polarization, associated with immune suppres-
sion and tumor progression. PPARγ and PPARδ control distinct aspects of M2 macrophage activation and oxidative metabolism. KLF4 and KLF2 
participate in the promotion of M2 macrophage functions by cooperating with STAT6 and suppressing the NF-κB/HIF-1α–dependent transcription, 
respectively. IL-4–induced c-Myc activity controls a subset of M2-associated genes. IL-4 also induces the M2-polarizing Jmjd3-IRF4 axis to inhibit 
IRF5-mediated M1 polarization. IL-10 promotes M2 polarization through the induction of p50 NF-κB homodimer, c-Maf, and STAT3 activities.

Epigenetic changes and noncoding RNAs also participate 
in directing macrophage polarization (32–34). IL-4 induces 
upregulation of the histone demethylase JMJD3 in mouse macro-
phages, which alters chromatin modifications to promote expres-
sion of M2 genes and inhibit M1 genes. miR-155 was recently iden-
tified as targeting the IL-13Rα1 subunit, thus decreasing a set of 
M2 genes in human macrophages (35).
Pathology
Resolution of inflammation and repair. Remodeling and repair occur 
dynamically during ontogenesis and inflammation, and these pro-
cesses are orchestrated by macrophages.
Macrophages undergo dynamic changes during different phases 
of wound healing. M1-polarized macrophages mediate tissue dam-
age and initiate inflammatory responses (1, 2). During the early 
stages of the repair response after wounding the skin, infiltrating 
macrophages have an M2 phenotype and their depletion inhibits 
the formation of a highly vascularized, cellular granulation tissue 
and of scar tissues (36). Under these conditions, the removal of 
apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) (37, 38) and the presence of TGF-β  
(39) may skew macrophage function, though demonstration of 
actual in vivo relevance of these findings is lacking.
In a peritoneal model of inflammation, resolution phase macro-
phages expressed a unique mixed M1-M2 phenotype, and cAMP 
was essential to restrain M1 activation (40). In humans, chronic 
venous ulcers (CVU) represent a failure to resolve a chronic inflam-
matory condition (41). Correlative analysis in patients and a 
mouse model suggested that in CVU the infiltrating macrophages 
fail to switch from an M1 to an M2 phenotype (41). Notably, iron 
metabolism is differentially regulated in polarized macrophages 
(42). In CVU, the iron overload in macrophages sustained their M1 
activation, leading to ROS-mediated DNA damage, fibroblast cel-
lular senescence, and defective tissue repair (41). It is tempting to 
speculate that similar mechanisms may underlie M2 functions in 
patients with severe burns, where hemorrhage and tissue damage, 
along with the high release of iron by M2 macrophages (42), may 
result in high iron tissue levels (43).
Dynamic changes in the phenotype of recruited mononuclear 
phagocytes have been observed in models of ischemic heart disease 
(44), suggesting that this is a general feature of the natural history of 
repair processes. In a murine model of hind limb ischemia, haplode-
ficiency of the oxygen sensor prolyl-hydroxylase PHD2 induced the 
canonical NF-κB pathway in macrophages, which promoted their 
M2 polarization and proarteriogenic phenotype (45). This obser-
vation may suggest a functional link between oxygen deprivation, 
as occurring in wounds and tumors, and progressive induction of 
proarteriogenic M2 macrophages. Thus, although the macrophage 
phenotype in resolution need not be a phenocopy of in vitro–gener-
ated M2 cells, preclinical and clinical evidence support the long-held 
view of a key role of polarized macrophages in tissue repair.
In a model of retinal neuropathy, mononuclear phagocyte infil-
tration generates a neuroprotective microenvironment promot-
ing retinal progenitor cell survival (46). The interplay of polarized 
macrophages with stem and progenitor cells is likely a key com-
ponent of their role in repair and remodeling, although the actual 
tissue-protective significance of polarized macrophages in degen-
erative diseases and their involvement with stem and progenitor 
cells remain to be determined (see Supplemental References).
Macrophage activation has been found in autoimmune and 
inflammatory diseases and in particular in lupus nephritis 
(47). In a murine model of SLE, proinflammatory activation 
of macrophages was sustained by Notch signaling (48). Con-
versely, the acute phase protein serum amyloid P (SAP) skewed 
macrophages toward an antiinflammatory M2-like phenotype, 
thus alleviating lupus nephritis (49). In RA, a major source of 
M1 cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-12p70) (50) in the joints are 
the synovial macrophages, whose number correlate with the 
inflammatory disease activity (51). On this basis, PPARδ and 
PPARγ are considered potential disease-modifying drugs for RA 
(52, 53). In a murine model of experimental colitis, recruitment 
of CCL11-expressing Ly6ChiCCR2+ inflammatory monocytes 
into the colon correlates with eosinophil infiltration and his-
topathology (54).
Infection
Bacteria. M1 macrophages are generally considered responsible for 
resistance against intracellular pathogens and characterize infec-
tion with Listeria monocytogenes (55), Salmonella typhi, and Salmo-
nella typhimurium (56), as well as the early phases of infection with 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (57), Mycobacterium ulcerans, and Myco-
bacterium avium (58, 59). Uncontrolled M1 inflammation associ-
ated with acute infections with E. coli or Streptococcus sp. causes 
gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, neonatal meningitis, and 
sepsis (60). The M1-M2 switch observed during the transition 
from acute to chronic infection may provide protection against 
overwhelming uncontrolled inflammation; however, a phenotype 
switch can also favor pathogens that have evolved strategies to 
interfere with M1-associated killing (58, 61–64).
Chronic inflammation and granuloma formation are char-
acterized by the presence of macrophages with an epithelial 
morphology and by macrophage homotypic fusion with the 
formation of multinucleated giant cells (MNG) (65). IL-4–medi-
ated upregulation of E-cadherin, which engages in intercellular 
homotypic adhesion, is likely to underlie MNG formation. STAT6 
drives expression of E-cadherin and DC transmembrane protein 
(DC-STAMP; ref. 66) during MNG generation. The actual func-
tion and role of MNG remain elusive.
Parasites. In experimental and human parasite infections, macro-
phages generally undergo a dynamic switch toward M2 polariza-
tion (61, 67). The early and late phases of Taenia crassiceps infection 
are characterized by Th1-driven M1 and Th2-driven IL-4–mediat-
ed M2 polarization of macrophages, respectively (11, 68). A simi-
lar M1-M2 switch has been reported during Schistosoma mansoni 
and Trypanosoma congolense infection (69). In the chronic stage of 
T. crassiceps infection, the p50 NF-κB subunit (see above) promotes 
protective M2 macrophage polarization associated with decreased 
parasite burden (30).
The recurrent association of M2 polarization with parasite infec-
tions does not necessarily imply a generalized relevance in patho-
genesis. For instance, lineage-selective ablation of the IL-4α chain 
causes a dramatic increase in susceptibility to S. mansoni, but has 
no discernible effect on Nippostrongylus infection (70).
Viral infections. Polarized activation of macrophages has been 
associated with virus infection (e.g., HIV, Kaposi sarcoma–associ-
ated herpes virus, and others; see Supplemental References), and 
this polarization may be important in containing and limiting 
tissue damage. In particular, during severe respiratory syncytial 
virus–induced (RSV-induced) bronchiolitis, IL-4Rα/STAT6-
dependent M2 macrophage differentiation reduces inflammation 
and epithelial damage in lungs (71).

Allergy
Allergy is driven by Th2 cells and products and is associated with 
M2 polarization of macrophages (72, 73). IL-4–inducible che-
mokines acting on CCR4 (e.g., CCL22) have also been reported 
to promote skewing of macrophage function (74). Evidence now 
indicates that chitin- and arginase-dependent M2 pathways play 
an active role in pathogenesis (75, 76). Asthma is associated with 
tissue remodeling, including collagen deposition and goblet cell 
hyperplasia. IL-4–driven M2 polarization is likely to play a key role 
as an orchestrator of these processes (77).
Allergy represents a paradigm for IL-4/IL-13–driven type 2 
inflammation. However, there is evidence that the inflamma-
some/IL-1/Th17 pathway can also drive allergic inflammation 
(78, 79). Moreover, a Th1-associated cytokine, IL-18, has also 
been implicated in allergic inflammation (80). It is therefore per-
haps not surprising that mixed phenotype macrophages have 
been observed (81).
Cancer
Cancer-related inflammation is characterized by the recruitment 
of cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage to tumor tissues 
(2, 82, 83), which also condition the premetastatic niche, to 
favor secondary localization of cancer. Classically activated M1-
polarized macrophages have the potential to exhibit antitumor 
activity and to elicit tumor tissue disruption (4). At least in some 
models of carcinogenesis in the mouse, progression is associated 
with a phenotype switch from M1 to M2 (84). Th1-driven mac-
rophage activation was found to mediate elimination of senes-
cent hepatocytes, which drive subsequent carcinogenesis (85). 
It is therefore likely that classically activated M1 macrophages 
contribute to the T cell–mediated elimination and equilibrium 
phases during tumor progression (86).
At later stages of progression in mice and humans, TAMs gener-
ally have an M2-like phenotype with low IL-12 expression, high IL-10  
expression, and low tumoricidal activity and promotion of tissue 
remodeling and angiogenesis. TAM infiltration is generally associ-
ated with poor prognosis, as shown in Hodgkin disease, glioma, chol-
angiocarcinoma, and breast carcinoma (87, 88). However, TAMs with 
various functional states can coexist in the same tumor (2, 89). Vari-
ous pathways orchestrate the protumor function of myelomonocytic 
cells, including tumor-derived and host-derived signals (2). Lympho-
cytes are key orchestrators of TAM function (2), but pathways differ 
in tumors originating in different organs. For instance, skewing of 
macrophage function was found to be mediated by IL-4–producing 
Th2 cells in skin (90, 91) and by antibody-producing B cells in breast 
carcinogenesis (92, 93). B1 cells can promote cancer progression in 
the skin (5), and fibroblasts can also contribute to circuits driving 
macrophage polarization and tumor promotion (94).
Tumor cell products, including extracellular matrix compo-
nents, IL-10, CSF-1, and chemokines (CCL2, CCL18, CCL17, and 
CXCL4), set macrophages in an M2-like, cancer-promoting mode 
(82, 95–97). TAMs can also interact with and promote the tumori-
genicity of cancer stem cells (CSCs) via production of the milk-fat 
globule-epidermal growth factor–VIII (MFG-E8) by activation of 
the STAT3 and sonic hedgehog pathways (98).
The identification of the various cellular and molecular path-
ways that participate in inflammation in different human cancers 
will be required to translate our understanding of cancer-related 
inflammation to meaningful therapeutic advances.
Obesity and metabolism
Obesity-associated insulin resistance, diabetes, and metabolic 
syndrome are sustained by chronic subclinical inflammation 
(99). Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are a major component

of adipose tissue and are important players in obesity-associated 
pathology. In obese subjects and mice, adipocytes release media-
tors such as CCL2, TNF, or free fatty acids, which promote the 
recruitment and activation of ATMs (100–102). In turn, ATM-pro-
duced inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF, IL-6, IL-1β) counteract 
the insulin-sensitizing action of adiponectin and leptin, leading to 
insulin resistance. ATM infiltration correlates with the degree of 
obesity (101–103). ATM accumulation is orchestrated by selected 
chemokines and their receptors (e.g., CCL2/CCR2 or CCL5/CCR5) 
(101, 103, 104) and by the macrophage-derived apoptosis inhibitor 
of macrophages (AIM) (105).
ATMs from obese mice and humans are polarized toward an 
M1 phenotype, with upregulation of TNF and iNOS. In con-
trast “lean” ATMs express high levels of M2 genes, including 
IL-10, Ym1, and Arginase 1 (106, 107). Weight loss is associ-
ated with a shift back to an M2-like phenotype. However, evi-
dence indicates that the ATM population in obese patients is 
diverse, with a minor F4/80+CD11b+CD11c–, IL-10hi, M2-like 
population coexisting with M1 cells (106). Moreover, analysis 
of CD11c+ ATMs from obese mice revealed a mixed profile of 
several M1-M2 gene transcripts (108). Weight loss is associ-
ated with an increase in F4/80+CD11c–CD301+ M2-like macro-
phages, which promote lipolysis (109).
Progress has been made in defining the molecular pathways that 
account for polarization of ATMs (19, 20, 24, 110, 111) in obesity. 
Mice with macrophage-selective genetic inactivation of PPARγ, 
PPARδ, and KLF4 show inhibition of obesity-induced insulin 
resistance (19, 20, 24, 106, 110), although these results may be 
strain specific (112). The adipose tissue of obese subjects shows a 
marked reduction in KLF4 levels. Nguyen et al. have recently dem-
onstrated that adaptation to lower temperatures (thermogenesis) 
is associated with polarization of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and 
white adipose tissue (WAT) macrophages to the alternative state 
(M2), with increased expression of thermogenic genes (Ppargc1 
and Ucp1) (113). In response to cold, IL-4–driven M2 macrophages 
release noradrenaline in BAT and WAT, which coordinates fatty 
acid mobilization and energy expenditure (113). Although further 
work is needed to dissect the diversity and dynamics of ATMs,  
M2-like cells in nonobese individuals are likely involved in main-
taining adipose tissue homeostasis, preventing inflammation, and 
promoting insulin sensitivity. In contrast, M1-like ATMs drive 
obesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance (107). The 
role of macrophages in obesity and associated disorders underlines 
a homeostatic function of macrophages in metabolism as cells 
capable of reorienting their own metabolic activity and as orches-
trators of general metabolism.
Figure 2
Schematic representation of macrophage plasticity and polarization in pathology. Dynamic changes occur over time with evolution of pathology: 
for instance, a switch from M1 to M2 macrophage polarization characterizes the transition from early to chronic phases of infection. Moreover, 
mixed phenotypes or populations with different phenotypes can coexist. For pathologies not discussed in the text, see Supplemental References.

Therapeutic targets in polarized inflammation
Specific macrophage-targeted therapies are now taking the first 
steps into the clinical arena (Table 1). In addition, therapeutic 
approaches not originally designed as macrophage oriented or spe-
cific have been found to affect macrophage activation and polar-
ization. These off-target examples provide insights and lessons for 
the development of more specifically directed approaches.
Recruitment is a key determinant sustaining macrophage 
numbers at sites of inflammation and immunity. Monocyte 
attractants include members of the chemokine superfamily, 
CCL2/MCP-1 in particular, and growth factors interacting with 
tyrosine kinase receptors CSF-1 and VEGF (83, 114, 115). CSF-1 
receptor (c-fms) kinase inhibitors have been generated, and these 
molecules exhibit antiangiogenic and antimetastatic activity in 
acute myeloid leukemia and melanoma models (116, 117). Che-
mokines and CSF-1 are more than monocyte attractants; they 
also promote M2-like skewing of macrophage function (97, 
118, 119). Antibodies directed against CCL2/CCR2 have proven 
active in prostate and breast cancer (83, 120). A CCL2 inhibitor 
(bindarit) has proven active in preclinical models of cancer and 
vascular pathology, resulting in inhibition of monocyte recruit-
ment (121); this agent is now undergoing evaluation for clinical 
use. Anti–CSF-1 antibodies and antisense oligonucleotides sup-
press macrophage infiltration and xenograft mammary tumor 
growth in mice (122–124). VEGF inhibitors can decrease macro-
phage recruitment, and this effect may contribute to their anti-
angiogenic activity (125). In contrast, in response to neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, altered composition in the immune microenvi-
ronment was found in breast cancer patients, with increased per-
centage of infiltrating myeloid cells (126).
Recent results suggest that in situ, proliferation is a key deter-
minant of macrophage accumulation during inflammation in 
the peritoneum and lungs (127, 128). In the latter, IL-4 was found 
to sustain macrophage proliferation. If proliferation is indeed a 
major general mechanism sustaining macrophage accumulation, 
this may suggest novel approaches to reduce macrophage numbers 
in situ and a different perspective for anti–CSF-1/CSF-1R strate-
gies. However, determining the actual significance of macrophage 
proliferation in humans, in particular in Th2-mediated inflamma-
tion, is a major stumbling block in this perspective.
Reorienting and reshaping deranged macrophage polarization 
is the holy grail of macrophage therapeutic targeting (129). Polar-
ized phenotypes are reversible in vitro and in vivo (29, 130–132). 
In proof of concept and in a large clinical study in ovarian cancer 
patients, IFN-γ was found to activate TAM tumoricidal activity, 
inducing a phenotype switch with unequivocal evidence of clinical 
responses (133). In a model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 
CD40 agonist antibodies promoted a remarkable antitumor effect 
and induced high expression of M1 markers (MHC class II and 
CD86) in macrophages (132).
Modulation of macrophage function is an off-target effect for 
a number of diverse therapeutic agents. PPARγ agonists (thia-
zolidinediones) have long been used in the treatment of diabetes. 
The evidence linking PPARγ to M2 polarization and hence to the 
homeostatic role of ATMs sheds fresh new light on their mode 
of action. Preclinical evidence suggests that PPARγ promotes  
M2-like polarization and homeostatic metabolic function in ATMs 
and that alteration of this function is a key pathogenic feature in 
diabetes (134–136). Other therapeutic strategies that have been 
reported to affect macrophage polarization include zoledronic 
acid (an agent used for preventing recurrence of breast cancer bone 
metastasis), statins (137), trabectedin (138) and TLR ligands (e.g., 
imiquimod and CpG) (see also Supplemental References).
Concluding remarks
Progress has been made in defining the molecular networks 
underlying polarized activation of macrophages. Molecular 
determinants of M1 versus M2 polarization include members 
of the PPAR, KLF, IRF, STAT, NF-κB, and HIF families. Regu-
lation of skewing also involves epigenetic modifications with 
involvement of histone methylation and acetylation. miRNAs 
have emerged as regulators of phagocyte activation and function 
(34, 139), but their role in macrophage polarization needs to be 
further defined.
Functional polarization has now been observed in vivo under 
physiological and pathological conditions. The former include 
embryogenesis and pregnancy and normal maintenance of select-
ed tissues, such as testis and adipose. The latter include chronic 
inflammation and tissue repair, metabolic and vascular disorders, 
infection, and cancer. There is now evidence that macrophages are 
a key component of all of these processes (Figure 2).
Under condition such as parasite infections, allergy, and many 
cancers, the functional phenotypes of macrophages in vivo mirror 
those of canonical M1-M2 or M2-like polarized states as defined 
in vitro. However, in a number of pathological conditions, such as 
neurodegenerative disorders (140), this is not the case, and macro-
phage populations express mixed or unique phenotypes. The con-
tribution of coexisting cells with different phenotypes, the impact 
of dynamic changes during disease evolution, and the molecular 
networks orchestrating these mixed phenotypes need to be carefully 
dissected on a case-by-case basis. Indeed, this macrophage plasticity 
calls for in-depth analysis in different pathological conditions.
Therapeutic macrophage targeting is in its infancy. Selected 
clinically approved therapeutic strategies, such as use of PPARγ 
inhibitors, statins, zolendronic acid, and preventive activities such 
as weight loss may have an impact on the functional status of 
macrophages; however, the extent to which their effect on mac-
rophages explains their clinical efficacy remains to be defined. 
The identification of mechanisms and molecules associated with 
macrophage plasticity and polarized activation provides a basis for 
macrophage-centered diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

Experiences, whether they be learning in a classroom, a stressful event, or ingestion of a psychoactive substance, impact the
brain by modifying the activity and organization of specific neural circuitry. A major mechanism by which the neural activity
generated by an experience modifies brain function is via modifications of synaptic transmission; that is, synaptic plasticity.
Here, we review current understanding of the mechanisms of the major forms of synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses in
the mammalian brain. We also provide examples of the possible developmental and behavioral functions of synaptic plasticity
and how maladaptive synaptic plasticity may contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders.

INTRODUCTION
One of the most important and fascinating properties of the
mammalian brain is its plasticity; the capacity of the neural
activity generated by an experience to modify neural circuit
function and thereby modify subsequent thoughts, feelings,
and behavior. Synaptic plasticity specifically refers to the
activity-dependent modification of the strength or efficacy
of synaptic transmission at preexisting synapses, and for
over a century has been proposed to play a central role in
the capacity of the brain to incorporate transient experi-
ences into persistent memory traces. Synaptic plasticity is
also thought to play key roles in the early development of
neural circuitry and evidence is accumulating that impair-
ments in synaptic plasticity mechanisms contribute to
several prominent neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, eluci-
dating the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying
synaptic plasticity in any number of different brain regions
is critical for understanding the neural basis of many
aspects of normal and pathological brain function.
Given the diversity of the functions ascribed to synaptic
plasticity, it is not surprising that many forms and
mechanisms of synaptic plasticity have been described.
Synaptic transmission can be either enhanced or depressed
by activity, and these changes span temporal domains
ranging from milliseconds to hours, days, and presumably
even longer. Furthermore, virtually all excitatory synapses
in the mammalian brain simultaneously express a number
of different forms of synaptic plasticity. Here, we attempt to
provide a broad overview of the mechanisms of the most
prominent
forms
of
plasticity
observed
at
excitatory
synapses in the mammalian brain. After briefly reviewing
short-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity, we will emphasize
current understanding of the cellular mechanisms and
possible functions of the class of phenomena commonly
termed long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depres-
sion (LTD).
SHORT-TERM SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY
Numerous forms of short-term synaptic plasticity, lasting
on the order of milliseconds to several minutes, have been
observed at virtually every synapse examined in organisms
ranging from simple invertebrates to mammals (Zucker and
Regehr, 2002). These are thought to play important roles in
short-term adaptations to sensory inputs, transient changes
in behavioral states, and short-lasting forms of memory.
Most forms of short-term synaptic plasticity are triggered
by short bursts of activity causing a transient accumulation
of calcium in presynaptic nerve terminals. This increase in
presynaptic
calcium
in
turn
causes
changes
in
the
probability of neurotransmitter release by directly modify-
ing the biochemical processes that underlie the exocytosis
of synaptic vesicles.

depressed relative to the response to the first stimulus (Katz
and Miledi, 1968; Zucker and Regehr, 2002). Paired-pulse
depression is commonly observed at all synapses at short
(less than 20 ms) interstimulus intervals, and most probably
results from inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium or
calcium channels or from a transient depletion of the
release-ready pool of vesicles docked at the presynaptic
terminal. Many synapses exhibit paired-pulse facilitation at
longer
interstimulus
intervals
(20–500 ms).
A
simple
explanation for this phenomenon is that the residual
calcium left over from the invasion of the first action
potential contributes to additional release during the second
stimulation, but it is likely that additional mechanisms are
involved. These may involve activation of protein kinases
that modulate the activity of presynaptic phosphoproteins.
For example, mice in which the presynaptic phosphoprotein
synapsin (De Camilli et al, 1990) has been knocked out,
exhibit abnormal short-term plasticity (Rosahl et al, 1993,
1995).
Whether a synapse exhibits paired-pulse facilitation or
depression depends on the recent history of activation of
the synapse. Because these forms of plasticity largely result
from changes in the probability of transmitter release (p),
synapses that begin with a very high p tend to depress their
response to the second pulse (Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997).
In contrast, synapses with a low initial p normally exhibit an
increase in p in response to the second stimulus. Consistent
with this idea, manipulations that decrease p (eg, activation
of presynaptic autoreceptors) almost always cause an
increase in the magnitude of paired-pulse facilitation, or
even a conversion of paired-pulse depression to facilitation.
Thus, the same synapse can display either facilitation or
depression, depending on its recent history of activation
and modulation.
Facilitation and Depression Following Trains of
Stimuli
Longer-lasting forms of plasticity are observed following
repetitive or tetanic stimulation of synapses with prolonged
(approximately 200 ms to 5 s) trains of stimulation applied
at high frequencies (10–200 Hz) (Zucker and Regehr, 2002).
Augmentation and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) describe
an enhancement of transmitter release lasting from seconds
(augmentation) to several minutes (PTP). They also involve
an increase in the probability of transmitter release in
response to an action potential due, in large part, to the
buildup
of
calcium
concentration
in
the
presynaptic
terminal during the stimulus trains. This residual calcium
may combine with the calcium influx elicited by the
subsequent single action potential to enhance directly the
release of neurotransmitter, or may lead to biochemical
modifications of proteins in the presynaptic terminal
(Magleby and Zengel, 1982; Zucker and Regehr, 2002).
At some synapses, repetitive activation leads to depres-
sion that can last for several seconds or even minutes (Betz,
1970; Zucker and Regehr, 2002). As in paired-pulse
depression, this generally occurs in synapses that exhibit a
high probability of release, and is thought to result, at least
in part, from a transient depletion of the release-ready pool
of synaptic vesicles. The decrease in synaptic strength can
also arise from the release of modulatory substances from
the activated presynaptic terminals, postsynaptic cells, or
even neighboring cells, initiating a signaling cascade that
leads to inhibition of the presynaptic release machinery.
Finally, a postsynaptic mechanism of short-term plasticity
may involve desensitization of ligand-gated receptors,
making the target neuron less sensitive to neurotransmitter.
A key characteristic of depression at many synapses is use
dependence. Higher levels of transmission are associated
with larger depression, and reduction of baseline transmis-
sion (eg, by reducing external calcium concentration)
relieves depression.
Modulation of Transmission by Presynaptic
Receptors
Most presynaptic terminals possess a number of different
types of metabotropic G-protein-coupled receptors, as well
as ionotropic receptors (MacDermott et al, 1999). The
probability of transmitter release, a significant factor in
defining synaptic strength, is controlled in part by the
occupancy of these receptors, which in turn is set by the
extracellular concentrations of their agonists. In some cases,
tonic levels of endogenous ligands are sufficient to partially
activate the receptors. Nonetheless, synaptic activity can
further increase receptor occupancy by transiently elevating
the concentration of various presynaptic neuromodulators
(Thompson et al, 1993; Miller, 1998). Depending on their
specific properties, activation of these receptors can either
enhance or depress synaptic transmission.
Via the release of a number of different neuromodulators,
postsynaptic
cells
can
also
influence
the
release
of
transmitter from presynaptic terminals. A common scenar-
io is that in response to strong postsynaptic depolarization,
dendrites release retrograde messengers that act through G-
protein-coupled receptors located on presynaptic terminals
to influence neurotransmitter release. Retrograde messen-
gers that have been identified in specific cell types include
dopamine, dynorphin, glutamate, GABA, nitric oxide,
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and oxytocin
(Drake et al, 1994; Kombian et al, 1997; Llano et al, 1991;
Naggapan and Lu, 2005; Nugent et al, 2007; Pitler and Alger,
1992; Zilberter, 2000; Zilberter et al, 1999). Although
postsynaptic, calcium-dependent fusion of vesicles is one
common mechanism for the release of retrograde messen-
gers, they can also released by non-vesicular mechanisms.
For example, a widespread, extensively studied system for
mediating retrograde synaptic signaling involves the post-
synaptic release of endogenous cannabinoids, such as
anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, which are pro-
duced upon demand by cleavage of phospholipids and are
sensed by CB1 receptors on presynaptic terminals. The
mechanisms of endocannabinoid release are unclear and
may involve a transporter, which facilitates diffusion across
the plasma membrane (Chevaleyre et al, 2006) Such
retrograde signaling by postsynaptic release of endocanna-
binoids can be initiated by strong depolarization or
activation of postsynaptic metabotropic receptors and has
been shown to transiently suppress inhibitory and excita-
tory synapses in several brain regions (Chevaleyre et al,
2006). Importantly, in the striatum, there is a form of LTD
(to be discussed below) that is triggered by the release of
endocannabinoids.

Involvement of Glia in Short-Term Plasticity
There is growing realization that glia may be involved in
some forms of short-term plasticity (Araque et al, 2001;
Haydon,
2001).
With
their
intimate
association
with
synapses, astrocytes and perisynaptic Schwann cells are
well
positioned
to
regulate
synapses.
They
have
an
established role in clearance of neurotransmitter and may
participate in synaptic plasticity by controlling the speed
and extent of such clearance (Bergles et al, 1999; Danbolt,
2001). This can in turn impact on the degree of postsynaptic
receptor activation and desensitization. Another way that
glia may be involved in synaptic plasticity is by sensing
extracellular messengers and then releasing substances that
in turn can directly affect synaptic efficacy (Araque et al,
2001; Haydon, 2001). For example, glia express many
different neurotransmitter receptors (eg, glutamate recep-
tors), which when activated result in the release of
substances (eg, ATP) that can then act on presynaptic
terminals to regulate neurotransmitter release.
Functions of Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity
Short-term synaptic plasticity was originally established as
behaviorally important from studies of simple organisms
such as Aplysia (Kandel and Tauc, 1965). In the mammalian
brain, an important consequence of short-term synaptic
plasticity
is
to
influence
the
information
processing
function of synapses, enabling them to act as filters with a
wide range of properties. For example, synapses with a low
initial probability of release function as high-pass filters,
since they will facilitate during high-frequency action
potential bursts while low-frequency bursts will not be
transmitted with the same efficacy. In contrast, synapses
with a high initial probability of release function as low-pass
filters, since they will depress during high-frequency bursts
but will reliably relay low-frequency activity (Abbott and
Regehr, 2004). The filtering characteristics of a synapse can
be adjusted through modulation of the initial release
probability. This most commonly occurs due to the release
of neuromodulators that, via activation of presynaptic
receptors, reduce the probability of release. This changes
the filtering characteristics of the synapse, causing facilita-
tion to become predominant over depression. In this way,
presynaptic inhibition can convert a synapse from a low-
pass to a high-pass filter.
LONG-TERM SYNAPTIC PLASTICIY
It is widely believed that experience of any sort modifies
subsequent behavior at least in part through activity-
dependent, long-lasting modifications of synaptic strength.
The brain encodes external and internal events as complex,
spatio-temporal patterns of activity in large ensembles
of neurons that can be conceptualized as ‘neural circuits’.
A key feature defining the behavior of any given neural
circuit is the pattern of synaptic weights that connect
the individual neurons that comprise the circuit. A corollary
to this hypothesis is that new information is stored
(ie, memories are generated) when activity in a circuit
causes a long-lasting change in the pattern of synaptic
weights. This idea was put forward over 100 years ago
by the Spanish Nobel laureate Santiago Ramon y Cajal,
and was further advanced in the late 1940s by Donald
Hebb,
who
proposed
that
associative
memories
are
formed in the brain by a process of synaptic modification
that strengthens connections when presynaptic activity
correlates with postsynaptic firing (Hebb, 1949). This
proposed
function
for
synaptic
plasticity,
forming
a
memory trace following the detection of two coincident
events, suggests an appealing cellular basis for behavioral
phenomena
such
as
Pavlovian
classical
conditioning
(Pavlov, 1927).
Experimental support for the very existence of such
long-lasting,
activity-dependent
changes
in
synaptic
strength was lacking until the early 1970s when Bliss
and colleagues (Bliss and Gardner-Medwin, 1973; Bliss
and Lomo, 1973) reported that repetitive activation of
excitatory synapses in the hippocampus caused a potentia-
tion of synaptic strength that could last for hours or even
days. Over the last three decades, this phenomenon,
eventually termed LTP, has been the object of intense
investigation because it is widely believed that it provides an
important key to understanding some of the cellular and
molecular mechanisms by which memories are formed
(Martin et al, 2000; Pastalkova et al, 2006; Whitlock et al,
2006).
Although still considered prototypic, it is now clear that
hippocampal LTP is only one of several different forms of
long-term synaptic plasticity that exist in specific circuits in
the mammalian brain. Importantly, it is well established
that most synapses that exhibit LTP also express one or
more forms of LTD. Thus, a key concept is that synaptic
strength at excitatory synapses is bidirectionally modifiable
by different patterns of activity. Furthermore, it is now clear
that the terms ‘LTP’ and ‘LTD’ describe a class of
phenomena, the underlying mechanisms of which vary
depending on the circuits in which they function.
Additional forms of synaptic plasticity more recently
identified
include
homeostatic
plasticity
(Turrigiano
and
Nelson,
2004) and
metaplasticity
(Abraham
and
Bear, 1996). The major form of homeostatic plasticity is
‘synaptic scaling’, which describes phenomena whereby
the strength of all synapses on a given cell are adjusted in
response to prolonged changes in activity. Specifically,
prolonged decreases in overall activity cause a net scaling
up of total synaptic strengths while prolonged increases in
activity cause the opposite, a scaling down of synaptic
strengths. This form of plasticity operates on a much
slower timescale than LTP or LTD and may be parti-
cularly
important
during
the
development
of
neural
circuits. Metaplasticity refers to the effects that activity
can have on the capacity of synapses to express long-term
plasticity.
The most extensively studied and therefore prototypic
forms of synaptic plasticity are the LTP and LTD observed
in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (Figure 1), which are
triggered by activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptors (NMDARs). We will therefore begin with a
discussion of their underlying mechanisms. We will then
proceed to reviewing some of the other prominent forms of
LTP and LTD for which mechanisms have been most firmly
established.

NMDAR-Dependent LTP
No form of plasticity has generated more interest, or been
more extensively studied than LTP in the CA1 region of the
hippocampus. The excitement surrounding this phenom-
enon is due to compelling evidence from rodents, primates,
and humans associating the hippocampus with a neural
system involved in various forms of long-term memory
(Martin et al, 2000; Zola-Morgan and Squire, 1993).
Furthermore, several basic properties of LTP make it an
attractive cellular mechanism for rapid information storage.
Similar to memory, LTP can be generated rapidly and is
strengthened and prolonged by repetition. It also exhibits
cooperativity, associativity, and input specificity. (Nicoll
et al, 1988). Cooperativity means that LTP can be induced
by the coincident activation of a critical number of
synapses. Associativity is the capacity to potentiate a weak
input (a small number of synapses) when it is activated in
association with a strong input (a larger number of
synapses). As such, associativity is a cellular analogue of
classical conditioning and is an implicit property of the so-
called Hebbian synapse. Input specificity indicates that LTP
is elicited only at activated synapses and not at adjacent,
inactive synapses on the same postsynaptic cell. This feature
dramatically increases the storage capacity of individual
neurons since different synapses on the same cell can be
involved in separate circuits encoding different bits of
information.
A major technological advance in the study of synaptic
plasticity was the development of the hippocampal slice
preparation that made LTP accessible to rigorous experi-
mental analysis (Figure 1b). Indeed, the bulk of our
knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of LTP has been
derived from studies of LTP at excitatory synapses on CA1
pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices. Similar or
identical forms of LTP have been observed at excitatory
synapses throughout the brain. Thus, the conclusions drawn
from the study of LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region are
often applied to other brain regions.
Triggering NMDAR-dependent LTP. A major advance in
the understanding of excitatory synaptic function and LTP
was the demonstration that two major types of ionotropic
glutamate receptors contribute to the postsynaptic response
at glutamatergic synapses, a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-
isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors (AMPARs) and
NMDARs (Figure 1c). These receptors are often (although
not always, as will be elaborated upon later) found

both the NMDA and AMPARs. Na + flows through the AMPAR channel but not through the NMDAR channel because of the Mg2 + block of this channel.
Depolarization of the postsynaptic cell (right) relieves the Mg2 + block of the NMDAR channel and allows both Na + and Ca2 + to flow into the dendritic
spine. The resultant increase in Ca2 + in the dendritic spine is necessary for triggering the subsequent events that drive synaptic plasticity.

colocalized on individual dendritic spines. The AMPAR has
a channel that is permeable to monovalent cations (Na +
and K +), and activation of AMPARs provides most of the
inward current that generates the excitatory synaptic
response when the cell is close to its resting membrane
potential. In contrast to AMPARs, the NMDAR exhibits a
strong voltage dependence because of the block of its
channel at negative membrane potentials by extracellular
magnesium (Mayer et al, 1984; Nowak et al, 1984). As a
result,
NMDARs
contribute
little
to
the
postsynaptic
response during basal synaptic activity. However, when
the cell is depolarized, magnesium dissociates from its
binding site within the NMDAR channel, allowing ions to
enter the cell. Importantly, unlike AMPAR channels, the
NMDAR channel allows calcium as well as sodium to enter
the postsynaptic dendritic spine (Figure 1c).
It is firmly established that the triggering (also termed the
induction) of LTP in the CA1 region requires activation of
NMDARs during strong postsynaptic depolarization leading
to
a
increase
in
postsynaptic
calcium
concentration,
which likely has to reach some critical threshold value to
activate the biochemical processes necessary for LTP
(Malenka, 1991; Malenka and Nicoll, 1993). Experimentally,
this is normally achieved by applying high-frequency
tetanic stimulation to the synapses or by use of a ‘pairing-
protocol’ during which the postsynaptic cell is directly
depolarized while low-frequency synaptic activation is
sustained. An additional method for induction of LTP (as
well as LTD) involves protocols that generate so-called
‘spike-time dependent plasticity’ (STDP; Dan and Poo, 2006;
Markram et al, 1997). In studies of STDP, LTP is induced
if afferent stimulation generates a synaptic response within
a
discrete
time
window
prior
to
the
firing
of
the
postsynaptic cell.
Because its contribution to postsynaptic reponses re-
quires both presynaptic release of glutamate and post-
synaptic depolarization due to the simultaneous activation
of a population of synapses, the NMDAR is often referred to
as a ‘coincidence detector’. These properties of NMDARs
also explain the basic properties of LTP. Cooperativity and
associativity occur because of the requirement for multiple
synapses
to
be
activated
simultaneously
to
generate
adequate postsynaptic depolarization to remove the mag-
nesium block of the NMDAR. Input specificity is due to the
compartmentalized increase in calcium, which is limited to
the postsynaptic dendritic spine and does not influence
adjacent spines (Nicoll et al, 1988).
LTP
signal
transduction
mechanisms.
An
extensive
number
of
signal
transduction
molecules
have
been
suggested to play a role in translating the calcium signal
that is required to trigger LTP into the long-lasting increase
in synaptic strength (Malenka and Bear, 2004; Sanes and
Lichtman, 1999). However, only for a handful of these has
compelling evidence of a mandatory role in LTP been
presented. A major limitation of much of the literature on
this topic stems from inadequate distinctions between
molecules that are key components of the molecular
machinery directly responsible for the triggering of LTP
(‘mediators’), and those molecules which may modulate
the ability to generate LTP, or play a permissive role
(‘modulators’). Some basic criteria that can be suggested for
defining the role of a protein as a mediator of LTP induction
are: (1) blocking the activation of the molecule during LTP
induction blocks LTP; and (2) activation of the molecule
induces a potentiation of synaptic transmission, which
occludes further synaptic induction of LTP.
Strong
evidence
indicates
that
calcium/calmodulin
(CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) fulfills these
requirements and is a key component of the molecular
machinery for LTP. CaMKII undergoes autophosphoryla-
tion after the triggering of LTP (Barria et al, 1997; Fukunaga
et al, 1995), and LTP induction was prevented both in
knockout mice lacking a critical CaMKII subunit (Silva
et al, 1992), and in knock-in animals in which endogenous
CaMKII was replaced with a form lacking the autopho-
sphorylation site (Giese et al, 1998). Furthermore, inhibition
of CaMKII activity by directly loading postsynaptic cells
with peptides that impair CaMKII function blocks LTP
(Malenka et al, 1989; Malinow et al, 1989), whereas acutely
increasing the postsynaptic concentration of active CaMKII
increases synaptic strength and occludes LTP (Lledo et al,
1995; Pettit et al, 1994).
Several other kinases have been implicated in the
triggering of LTP, but the experimental evidence supporting
their role is not as well substantiated as that for CaMKII.
Activation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-depen-
dent protein kinase (PKA), perhaps by the activation of a
calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase, has been suggested
to boost the activity of CaMKII indirectly by decreasing
competing protein phosphatase activity (Blitzer et al, 1998;
Lisman, 1989; Makhinson et al, 1999). This presumably
happens by phosphorylation of inhibitor 1, an endogenous
inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). The extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
(Erk)/mitogen-activated
protein
kinase (MAPK) pathway has also been suggested to be
important for LTP, as well as some forms of learning and
memory (Sweatt, 2004; Thomas and Huganir, 2004). In
addition, Src kinase has been implicated in the enhance-
ment of NMDAR function during LTP induction (Kalia
et al, 2004). Finally, protein kinase C and in particular the
atypical
PKC
isozyme,
PKMz,
has
received
attention
because this isozyme is rapidly expressed upon induction
of LTP and recent studies have implicated PKMz in the
maintenance of the late phase of LTP both in hippocampal
slices and in vivo (Hrabetova and Sacktor, 1996; Ling et al,
2002; Pastalkova et al, 2006; Serrano et al, 2005).
Obviously, it remains a very challenging task to be able to
definitively identify the key intracellular signaling cascades
responsible for the triggering of LTP. Recent technical
advances in mass spectrometric techniques for the profiling
of post-transcriptional modifications in mixed populations
of proteins, as well as the practicality of RNAi approaches
for knockdown of candidate proteins, should help further
characterize the major LTP players and their dynamic
interplay.
Expression mechanisms of LTP. In the past, a major point
of contention was whether LTP was primarily expressed
postsynaptically as a change in AMPAR properties or
presynaptically, as a change in the probability of transmitter
release. This latter expression mechanism garnered sig-
nificant attention because it required the production of a
retrograde messenger that was released by postsynaptic

cells and acted on presynaptic terminals (for a thorough
review of the evidence for either locus of expression, see
Nicoll, 2003). To a large extent, this controversy has been
resolved, with the emerging consensus that the major
mechanism of expression of LTP at hippocampal CA1
synapses involves an increase in the numbers of AMPARs
within the postsynaptic density, driven through activity-
dependent changes in AMPAR trafficking (Bredt and Nicoll,
2003; Derkach et al, 2007; Malenka and Nicoll, 1999;
Malinow and Malenka, 2002; Song and Huganir, 2002).
A major contribution to ending the controversy was the
proposal of the silent synapse hypothesis and the evidence
supporting it (Durand et al, 1996; Isaac et al, 1995; Liao
et al, 1995; Malenka and Nicoll, 1997). Silent synapses are
synapses that contain only NMDARs with few or no
AMPARs, such that at normal resting membrane potentials
these synapses exhibit no detectable postsynaptic responses
to synaptically released glutamate. The ‘unsilencing’ of these
synapses during the induction of LTP is thought to occur
through the incorporation of AMPARs into the postsynaptic
plasma membrane. This hypothesis was quickly expanded
to include synapses that already contained AMPARs and
has led to a large investigative effort into the molecular
mechanisms regulating the trafficking of AMPARs (Bredt
and Nicoll, 2003; Collingridge et al, 2004; Malinow and
Malenka, 2002; Sheng and Kim, 2002; Song and Huganir,
2002).
Most
AMPARs
in
the
central
nervous
system
are
tetramers comprised of four glutamate receptor subunits,
GluR1–GluR4. Although these subunits are highly homo-
logous, both the functional properties of AMPARs and their
trafficking has been suggested to depend on their subunit
composition (Collingridge et al, 2004; Derkach et al, 2007;
Malinow and Malenka, 2002). In the adult hippocampus,
two forms of AMPARs are thought to predominate: GluR1/
GluR2 heteromers and GluR2/GluR3 heteromers (Wenthold
et al, 1996). Based on clever overexpression studies, one
prominent hypothesis suggests that subunit-specific rules
govern the synaptic delivery of AMPARs (Hayashi et al,
2000; Passafaro et al, 2001; Shi et al, 2001). Specifically, it
has been suggested that the insertion of GluR1-containing
AMPARs into synapses is slow under basal conditions and
is strongly stimulated by NMDAR activation, whereas
insertion of GluR2/3 heteromeric receptors may occur
constitutively on a much more rapid timescale.
Where do these new AMPARs come from and how is their
trafficking regulated at a molecular level? Current evidence
suggests that recycling endosomes in the dendrites contain
a reserve pool of AMPARs that are mobilized during LTP
via a process that requires the small GTP-binding protein,
Rab11a (Park et al, 2004) (Figure 2). Surprisingly, AMPARs
do not appear to be inserted directly into the postsynaptic
density (PSD) but rather are exocytosed at perisynaptic
sites. They then can laterally diffuse in the plasma
membrane and be trapped within the PSD due to their
interactions with so-called ‘slot proteins’, which function to
trap AMPARs and greatly reduce their lateral mobility.
Attractive candidates for these slot proteins are a family of
proteins found in the PSD termed MAGUKs (for mem-
brane-associated guanylate kinases). MAGUKS are defined
by
their
multiple
protein
interaction
domains,
most
importantly so-called PDZ domains. Prominent members
of the MAGUK family of PSD proteins include PSD-95,
SAP97, PSD-93, and SAP102 (Kim and Sheng, 2004;
Montgomery et al, 2004). PSD-95 has received the most
attention and its level appears to be particularly important
for controlling the number of AMPARs at individual
synapses as evidenced by the findings that overexpression
of PSD-95 increases synaptic strength and occludes LTP
(Ehrlich and Malinow, 2004; Stein et al, 2003), whereas
knockdown of PSD-95 decreases surface expression of
AMPARs and synaptic strength (Ehrlich et al, 2007; Schluter
et al, 2006).
The influence of PSD-95, as well as other MAGUKS (Elias
et al, 2006; Futai et al, 2007; Schluter et al, 2006), on
AMPARs was surprising given that PSD-95 was originally
isolated because of its strong interaction with NMDARs
(Kornau et al, 1995). Another major surprise was that
AMPARs do not directly bind to MAGUKs but rather do so
via a family of AMPAR auxiliary subunits termed trans-
membrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs). TARPs
are required for the delivery of AMPARs to the plasma
membrane at extrasynaptic sites (Chen et al, 2000; Nicoll
et al, 2006) and also influence their biophysical properties
(Tomita et al, 2005a). Importantly, they are also required
for the synaptic localization of AMPARs due to their direct
interaction with MAGUKs (Schnell et al, 2002).
The detailed molecular mechanisms by which activation
of protein kinases such as CaMKII lead to the synaptic
delivery of AMPARs remains to be determined. Phosphor-
ylation of AMPAR subunits themselves by CaMKII does not
appear critical (Esteban et al, 2003; Lee et al, 2003) although
other phosphorylation sites, such as the PKA or the PKC
sites on GluR1, may be important (Boehm et al, 2006;
Esteban et al, 2003). On the other hand, there is reasonable
evidence that phosphorylation of TARPs occurs following
CAMKII activation (Tsui and Malenka, 2006) and that this
may be critical for LTP (Tomita et al, 2005b). It is, however,
highly likely that AMPARs and TARPs are just a component
of a large complex of proteins, the phosphorylation of which
will be required for LTP expression.
LTP also appears to involve a phosphorylation-driven
increase in the single-channel conductance of AMPARs
themselves (Benke et al, 1998; Soderling and Derkach,
2000). Indeed, CaMKII phosphorylates Ser831 in the
intracellular C terminus of GluR1, resulting in a significant
increase in single-channel conductance of homomeric
GluR1 receptors (Derkach et al, 1999, 2007). However, one
important caveat of this conclusion is that synaptic GluR1-
containing AMPARs also contain GluR2, and in GluR1/2
heteromeric AMPARs, the enhanced conductance upon
phosphorylation by CaMKII is absent (Oh and Derkach,
2005).
Although the evidence to date suggests a more prominent
role for AMPAR exocytosis, the relative contribution of
AMPAR trafficking and changes in the biophysical proper-
ties of AMPARs to the increase in synaptic strength during
LTP are not well defined. One model for the successive
events occurring during the first hour of LTP involves
activation of calcium-dependent signal transduction path-
ways, notably CaMKII, resulting in phosphorylation of
GluR1-containing receptors and an increase in their single-
channel conductance. Roughly simultaneously, AMPARs
are translocated into the PSD via exocytosis and lateral

movement within the plasma membrane. Most investigators
believe that the incorporation of AMPARs into the PSD is
the more important change because it appears to be
accompanied by structural changes in the dendritic spines
and synapses themselves, an attractive mechanism for
maintaining LTP (see below). There are also experimental
findings consistent with rapid presynaptic changes during
LTP, but the retrograde messenger that is responsible
remains elusive, one prominent possibility being BDNF
(Bramham and Messaoudi, 2005).
Maintaining
LTP.
Much
of
the
work
on
NMDAR-
dependent LTP has focused on the mechanisms responsible
for its initial 30–60 min, to a large extent because of
technical limitations in the duration over which stable
electrophysiological recordings can be maintained. None-
theless, the mechanisms that allow LTP to persist for hours,
days, or even longer are of great importance. Like virtually
all cell biological phenomena, the persistence of LTP is
dependent upon new protein synthesis (Reymann and Frey,
2007). This so-called ‘late phase of LTP’ (defined as the
potentiation present more than 1–2 h after LTP induction)
is commonly assumed to depend upon local dendritic
protein synthesis, which supplies needed components to the
synapse (Sutton and Schuman, 2006), as well as transcrip-
tion in the nucleus (Zhou et al, 2006). The signaling to the
nucleus required for long-lasting LTP has been suggested to
depend on a number of protein kinases including PKA,
CaMKIV, and Erk-MAPK, which activate key transcription
factors that may include cAMP response element-binding
protein and immediate-early genes such as c-Fos and
Zif268/Egr-1 (Thomas and Huganir, 2004). These transcrip-
tional
complexes
presumably
promote
expression
of
effector genes that are required for maintaining the synaptic
enhancement.
Several mRNAs can be found in dendrites, including
those of the AMPARs themselves, CaMKII, Arc, and
proteins which may function to regulate receptor trafficking
(Grooms et al, 2006; Job and Eberwine, 2001; Ju et al, 2004;
Mayford et al, 1996; Schuman et al, 2006; Steward and
Schuman, 2001). The trafficking of some of these mRNAs
and their local translation seems to be highly regulated by
activity. Furthermore, other components of the translational
machinery are found in or adjacent to dendritic spines and
polyribosomes are recruited to spine heads following LTP
induction (Bourne et al, 2007). Thus, there is accumulating
evidence that the machinery to provide local, newly
synthesized proteins to synapses is available.
An intriguing hypothesis is that during the synaptic
activation to induce LTP a ‘synaptic tag’ is generated that
functions to capture or sequester plasticity related proteins,
which in turn are required to stabilize the increase in
synaptic strength (Frey and Morris, 1997). However, little is
known about the identity of the synaptic tag or the newly
synthesized proteins that are required to maintain LTP,
although it has been suggested that PKA, CAMKII, or PKMz
might function as the synaptic tag (Reymann and Frey,
2007; Sajikumar et al, 2005; Young et al, 2006).

Model of AMPAR trafficking during LTP and LTD. In the basal state (depicted on top), receptors cycle between the postsynaptic membrane and
intracellular compartments. This is achieved through lateral mobility of the receptors out of the synapse into endocytic zones, where they are endocytosed
into early endosomes in a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent manner. Normally, the receptors are transferred to recycling endosomes and returned to the
plasma membrane by exocytosis, followed by lateral movement into the synapse where they are retained through interaction with MAGUKs. Following
induction of LTP, there is enhanced receptor exocytosis and stabilization at the synapse through a calcium-driven process that involves CAMKII and fusion of
recycling endosomes mediated by Rab11a. Following the induction of LTD, enhanced endocytosis at extrasynaptic sites occurs in a process that is calcium-
dependent and involves protein phosphatases, primarily calcineurin and protein phosphatases 1 (PP1). While in the basal state endocytosis is presumably
balanced by receptor recycling, following LTD receptors are retained within the cell, and perhaps degraded.

potentiated synapses (Luscher et al, 2000). Spines come in a
variety of shapes and sizes, and can undergo rapid shape
changes
that
are
influenced
by
activity
(Yuste
and
Bonhoeffer, 2001). Morphological changes which have been
reported
to
accompany LTP
include
growth
of new
dendritic spines, enlargement of preexisiting spines and
their PSDs, and the splitting of single PSDs and spines into
two functional synapses (Abraham and Williams, 2003;
Matsuzaki et al, 2004; Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2001). An
attractive
model
suggests
that
during
LTP,
recycling
endosomes contribute AMPAR subunits to the synapse, as
well as lipids and constituents which enlarge the synapse
(Lisman and Zhabotinsky, 2001; Luscher et al, 2000; Park
et al, 2004, 2006). At some later time point, there is likely a
concomitant increase in the presynaptic active zone, the size
of which always closely matches that of the PSD (Lisman
and Harris, 1993). This presynaptic re-modeling must
involve post- and presynaptic protein interactions with
likely candidates being cell adhesion molecules such as the
cadherins or neuroligin/neurexin interactions.
Summary. The current view of the mechanisms underlying
this form of LTP can be summarized as follows (Figure 2). A
large
NMDAR-dependent
increase
in
dendritic
spine
calcium concentrations leads to activation of intracellular
signaling cascades involving a number of protein kinases,
most importantly CaMKII. This leads to an increase in the
single-channel conductance of synaptic AMPARs and more
importantly, promotes the incorporation of additional
AMPARs into the PSD. The new synaptic AMPARs are
stabilized through their TARP-mediated interaction with
PDZ domain-containing proteins such as PSD-95. In
parallel, structural changes within the synapse occur, such
that the size of the PSD and dendritic spine are increased.
This in turn drives an increase in the size of the presynaptic
active
zone
such
that
the
potentiated
synapses
are
‘permanently’ enlarged. The maintenance of these changes
for more than a few hours depends on de novo transcription
as well as local dendritic protein synthesis, presumbably to
provide the synapses with a supply of the critical proteins
necessary for maintaining synaptic strength.
NMDAR-Dependent LTD
An important advance in the study of long-term synaptic
plasticity was the establishment of an experimentally
reproducible form of NMDAR-dependent LTD at excitatory
synapses on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (Dudek and
Bear, 1992). This demonstrated that activity could bi-
directionally control synaptic strength (Mulkey and Malenka,
1992), thus providing support for the idea that memories or
experiences were encoded by the distribution of synaptic
weights in neural circuits, not simply by LTP. Shortly
thereafter,
a
similar
form
of
LTD
was
observed
at
neocortical synapses (Kirkwood et al, 1993) suggesting that
mechanistic studies in the hippocampal CA1 region could
provide
insights
that
applied
to
excitatory
synapses
throughout the brain. While that remains true to a large
extent, we now know that in addition to NMDAR-dependent
LTD, there are several other forms of LTD, which we will
discuss in later sections. Moreover, similar to LTP, evidence
is accumulating that LTD mechanisms may contribute to a
large number of brain phenomena including experience-
dependent development, learning and memory, addiction,
and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and
Parkinson’s disease (Malenka and Bear, 2004; Brebner et al,
2005; Kreitzer and Malenka 2007; Hsieh et al, 2006).
Triggering NMDAR-dependent LTD. The typical protocol
for
eliciting
LTD
involves
prolonged
repetitive
low-
frequency stimulation (B900 stimuli at 1 Hz; Dudek and
Bear, 1992; Mulkey and Malenka, 1992), although the
number of stimuli can be dramatically reduced and the
frequency changed if the postsynaptic neuron is modestly
depolarized (to B50 mV), partially relieving the Mg2 +
block of the NMDAR (Selig et al, 1995). NMDAR-dependent
LTD can also be induced by correctly timing the activation
of presynaptic axons and the postsynaptic neuron (STDP;
(Dan and Poo, 2006).
Like LTP, LTD is input-specific and depends upon an
NMDAR-dependent
increase
in
postsynaptic
calcium
(Mulkey and Malenka, 1992). The predominant current
hypothesis is that quantitative properties of the postsynap-
tic calcium signal within dendritic spines dictates whether
LTP or LTD is triggered, with LTD requiring a modest
increase in calcium (Cummings et al, 1996), whereas LTP
requires a increase beyond some critical threshold value
(Malenka and Nicoll, 1993). The temporal characteristics of
the increase in calcium may also be important since
changing the relative timing between pre- and postsynaptic
activation by just a few tens of milliseconds can reverse the
direction of synaptic modification (Dan and Poo, 2006).
Differential buffering of postsynaptic calcium levels has
been reported to enable a transition between LTP and LTD
(Harney et al, 2006; Nishiyama et al, 2000). These findings
demonstrate the thin line that lies between synaptic activity
eliciting a potentiation vs a depression and provide support
to the idea that both LTP and LTD are utilized in parallel for
encoding experiences in vivo.
LTD signal transduction mechanisms. An influential
hypothesis for the signal transduction pathway triggering
LTD suggested that while LTP was due to the preferential
activation of CaMKII, LTD involves activation of a calcium-
dependent protein phosphatase cascade consisting of the
calcium/calmodulin-dependent
phosphatase
calcineurin
(also known as protein phosphatase 2B), PP1, and a
phosphoprotein termed inhibitor-1 which functions to
inhibit PP1 until it is dephosphorylated by calcineurin
(Lisman, 1989). Consistent with this hypothesis, postsynap-
tic inhibition of these phosphatases prevents LTD (Kirk-
wood and Bear, 1994; Morishita et al, 2001; Mulkey et al,
1994, 1993), whereas directly loading CA1 pyramidal cells
with PP1 enhances LTD (Morishita et al, 2001). Although
signaling proteins other than phosphatases have been
suggested to play key roles in LTD (Bolshakov et al, 2000;
Dan and Poo, 2006; Palmer et al, 2005; Peineau et al, 2007),
the hypothesis that LTP involves preferential activation of
protein kinases while LTD involves activation of phospha-
tases remains predominant.

(Hrabetova and Sacktor, 1996; Kameyama et al, 1998; Lee
et al, 2000, 1998. The evidence in support of a role for
dephosphorylation
of
PKA
substrates
during
LTD
is
particularly convincing, as postsynaptic inhibition of PKA,
or its displacement from intracellular anchoring proteins,
cause a rundown of synaptic transmission that occludes
LTD. The mechanism underlying specific dephosphoryla-
tion of PKA substrates during LTD could involve the
NMDAR-dependent recruitment of PP1 to synapses (Mor-
ishita et al, 2001) or the selective loss of PKA from synapses
(Gomez et al, 2002; Snyder et al, 2005). Consistent with a
role for PKA, LTD is associated with selective depho-
sphorylation of Ser845 on GluR1, a PKA substrate site (Lee
et al, 2000). This dephosphorylation event may contribute
to the expression of LTD, as it decreases the AMPAR open-
channel probability (Banke et al, 2000), and mice with
knock-in alanine substitution of both Ser845 and Ser831 (a
CaMKII-substrate site) exhibit impaired NMDAR-depen-
dent LTD (Lee et al, 2003).
Expression mechanisms of LTD. The demonstration of
silent synapses and their conversion to functional synapses
during LTP by the incorporation of AMPARs (Malenka and
Nicoll, 1997) immediately gave credence to the idea that the
opposite might happen during LTD, that is, the removal or
endocytosis of AMPARs. Consistent with this idea, it was
demonstrated that pharmacological manipulations of activ-
ity in cultured neurons (Carroll et al, 1999; Lissin et al,
1998) or application of glutamate receptor agonists (Beattie
et al, 2000; Carroll et al, 1999; Ehlers, 2000; Heynen et al,
2000; Lin et al, 2000; Lissin et al, 1998) could cause a loss of
AMPARs from synapses due to dynamin- and clathrin-
dependent endocytosis (Carroll et al, 2001; Collingridge
et al, 2004; Derkach et al, 2007; Malinow and Malenka,
2002). Furthermore, postsynaptic inhibition of dynamin
activity impaired LTD in CA1 pyramidal cells in slices (Lee
et al, 2002; Luscher et al, 1999; Morishita et al, 2005). Based
in large part on these sorts of observations, the current
leading hypothesis is that the expression mechanism of
NMDAR-dependent LTD is due to activity-dependent
endocytosis of synaptic AMPARs (Bredt and Nicoll, 2003;
Collingridge et al, 2004; Derkach et al, 2007; Malenka and
Bear, 2004; Malinow and Malenka, 2002) (Figure 2).
The precise molecular mechanisms by which endocytosis
of AMPARs occurs during LTD is still not clear but one
likely scenario is that it involves dissociation of AMPARs
from their anchors within the PSD, followed by lateral
movement to the edge of the PSD where they undergo
clathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis (Ashby et al,
2004; Blanpied et al, 2002; Groc et al, 2004). Consistent with
a key role for protein phosphatases, the endocytosis of
AMPARs is regulated by calcium-dependent dephosphor-
ylation (Beattie et al, 2000; Carroll et al, 2001; Ehlers, 2000).
Key substrates for facilitating endocytosis may include
components of the endocytic machinery (Carroll et al, 2001;
Lai et al, 1999; Slepnev et al, 1998) as well as AMPAR
subunits themselves (Ehlers, 2000). Following endocytosis,
AMPARs exhibit increased colocalization with the clathrin
adaptor protein AP2 (Carroll et al, 1999), an interaction that
may be promoted by the Ca2 +-dependent adaptor protein
hippocalcin (Palmer et al, 2005).
Consistent with a role for ‘slot proteins’ in the regulation
of AMPAR surface levels, LTD has been reported to depend
on PP1-dependent dephosphorylation of stargazin (Tomita
et al, 2005b). This dephosphorylation might permit the
dissociation of stargazin from PSD-95 and its diffusion out
of the PSD, enabling LTD through loss of synaptic AMPARs
(Ziff, 2007). Ubiquitination (Colledge et al, 2003) or
depalmitoylation (El-Husseini et al, 2002) of PSD-95 has
also been suggested to be critical for agonist-induced
endocytosis of AMPARs but whether these events are
required for synaptically induced LTD has not been
determined. Additional proteins implicated in AMPAR
endocytosis include the AMPAR interacting protein PICK1
(Hanley and Henley, 2005; Kim et al, 2001), the small
GTPases Rap1 (Zhu et al, 2002, 2005) and Rab5 (Brown
et al, 2005), and a protein termed cpg2 (Cottrell et al, 2004).
It has been suggested that particular AMPAR subunits,
specifically GluR2, may be especially important for the
endocytosis of AMPARs during LTD, in part because of its
direct interaction with AP2 (Lee et al, 2002). One key
finding consistent with this hypothesis is that peptides that
selectively interfere with this interaction have been reported
to inhibit LTD (Lee et al, 2002). However, AP2 can bind
other AMPAR subunits (Kastning et al, 2007; Lee et al,
2002) and LTD is still observed in hippocampal slices
obtained from mice lacking GluR2 as well as GluR2 and
GluR3 (Jia et al, 1996; Meng et al, 2003). Thus, the
importance of specific AMPAR subunits for LTD is not
firmly established.
Summary. A current simplified view of the mechanisms
underlying NMDAR-dependent LTD can be summarized as
follows (Figure 2): a modest increase in postsynaptic
calcium concentration within dendritic spines due to
modest activation of NMDARs leads to preferential activa-
tion of protein phosphatases (as well as a few other key
signaling proteins). This leads to the dissociation of
AMPARs from their molecular scaffolds in the PSD and
their lateral movement to endocytic zones on the periphery
of the PSD, where they are endocytosed and potentially
degraded. We have not discussed the maintenance of LTD
because there is little work on this topic. There is evidence
that LTD is accompanied by a shrinkage in the size of
dendritic spines (Nagerl et al, 2004; Zhou et al, 2004) and
that this may be due to the loss of AMPARs (Hsieh et al,
2006). Furthermore, similar to LTP, protein translation may
be needed for the long-term stable expression of LTD
(Pfeiffer and Huber, 2006). Thus, it is generally believed that
the activity-dependent trafficking of AMPARs into and out
of synapses during LTP and LTD, respectively, is the first
critical step in the morphological growth or shrinkage of
synapses and that these structural modifications are the
mechanisms by which bidirectional changes in synaptic
strength are maintained. Indeed, the size of individual
synapses correlates closely with the number of AMPARs
they contain (Matsuzaki et al, 2001; Nusser et al, 1998;
Takumi et al, 1999).
Presynaptic LTP

for over 30 years, it is clear that a mechanistically distinct

REVIEW
form of plasticity coexists in the hippocampus at the so-
called mossy fiber synapses, the synapses between the axons
of dentate gyrus granule cells (ie, mossy fibers) and the
proximal apical dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells (Nicoll
and Malenka, 1995; Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005). Mossy fiber
LTP (MF-LTP) is of increasing interest due to the fact that it
appears to be a prototype for mechanistically similar forms
of LTP found in several other brain regions including the
thalamus at corticothalamic synapses (Castro-Alamancos
and Calcagnotto, 1999), the cerebellum at parallel fiber-
Purkinje cell synapses (Linden, 1997; Salin et al, 1996), and
perhaps in the striatum at cortico-striatal synapses (Spencer
and Murphy, 2002). Thus, like NMDAR-dependent LTP,
this form of LTP may play multiple functional roles in the
brain.
In contrast to NMDAR-dependent LTP, the triggering and
expression of this form of LTP is thought to be solely or
predominantly presynaptic, thus we refer to it as presynap-
tic LTP. While somewhat controversial, most experimental
evidence suggests that presynaptic LTP is triggered by high-
frequency tetanic stimulation, which causes a large, activity-
dependent increase in calcium concentration within pre-
synaptic axon terminals (Nicoll and Malenka, 1995; Nicoll
and Schmitz, 2005; Zalutsky and Nicoll, 1990). Presynaptic
voltage-dependent calcium channels are the critical source
of the calcium increase, although the triggering of this LTP
at MF synapses can be facilitated by the activation of
presynaptic kainate receptors, particularly GluR6 (Lauri
et al, 2001; Schmitz et al, 2003). Results from pharmaco-
logical manipulations and knockout mice are all consistent
with the hypothesis that the increase in presynaptic calcium
activates a calcium/calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase.
This leads to a increase in presynaptic cAMP and activation
of PKA, which phosphorylates critical presynaptic sub-
strates to cause a long-lasting enhancement in transmitter
release (Nicoll and Malenka, 1995; Nicoll and Schmitz,
2005). Although this sequence of events is consistent with
most of the results from all of the synapses that have been
reported to express presynaptic LTP, surprisingly, a very
different postsynaptic induction mechanism has been
proposed to occur at MF synapses. This involves trans-
synaptic interactions between postsynaptic EphB receptor
tyrosine kinases and presynaptic B-Ephrin ligands leading,
via an unknown mechanism, to a long-lasting enhancement
of transmitter release (Armstrong et al, 2006; Contractor
et al, 2002).
Despite some controversy concerning the mechanism
underlying the induction of presynaptic LTP at MF
synapses, there is general agreement that its expression is
due to an increase in neurotransmitter release. One
mechanism
for
mediating
a
long-lasting
increase
in
transmitter release is to enhance the calcium influx into
the presynaptic terminal when it is invaded by an action
potential; for example via a long-lasting modulation of
presynaptic calcium channels. However, direct imaging of
the action potential-dependent increase in presynaptic
calcium in MF boutons indicates that no change occurs
following the triggering of MF-LTP (Kamiya et al, 2002;
Regehr and Tank, 1991; Reid et al, 2004).
The other major mechanism for enhancing transmitter
release is via some modulation of the machinery responsible
for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. In this context, the focus has
been on presynaptic proteins known to be substrates for
PKA. Because presynaptic terminals are relatively inacces-
sible, an important approach has been examining knockout
mice lacking specific presynaptic proteins. Mice lacking
synapsins exhibited normal MF-LTP (Spillane et al, 1995)
indicating that these prominent PKA substrates were not
necessary. In contrast, knockout animals lacking the
synaptic vesicle protein Rab3A, a small GTPase (Castillo
et al, 1997; Lonart et al, 1998), or its binding partner, the
active zone protein Rim1a (Castillo et al, 2002; Powell et al,
2004) lack both MF-LTP as well as presynaptic LTP in the
cerebellum. Rim1a is a substrate of PKA and thus these
findings suggest that presynaptic LTP may require a GTP-
dependent interaction between Rab3a and Rim1a at the
interface of synaptic vesicles and the active zone. Indeed,
using cultures of cerebellar neurons in which presynaptic
LTP can be elicited, the critical residue phosphorylated by
PKA in Rim1a has been identified (Lonart et al, 2003). One
important caveat to this hypothesis, however, is that the
presynaptic enhancement of synaptic transmission seen
upon application of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin
is unaltered in knockout mice lacking Rab3a or Rim1a. This
provides a complication for the simple model implicating
Rim1a and Rab3a as the crucial mediators of the enhanced
transmission caused by presynaptic activation of PKA.
Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor-Dependent
LTD
Under the appropriate experimental conditions, low-fre-
quency stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural
inputs to CA1 pyramidal cells can trigger, in addition to
NMDAR-dependent LTD, a mechanistically distinct form of
LTD, that is dependent upon activation of metabotropic
glutamate receptors (mGluRs; mGLUR LTD) (Anwyl, 2006;
Bolshakov et al, 2000; Malenka and Bear, 2004; Oliet et al,
1997). Various forms of mGluR LTD have been observed in
many brain regions, most notably at the parallel fiber to
Purkinje cell synapse (Ito, 1989; Linden and Connor, 1995).
This so-called cerebellar LTD is elicited when parallel fibers
are activated coincident with climbing fiber activation and
has been suggested to be particularly important for certain
forms of motor learning.
Typically, the induction of mGluR LTD in the CA1 region
of the hippocampus requires bursts of afferent stimulation
or paired-pulse stimulation at modest frequencies. Pre-
sumably, this increases the likelihood of activating the
extrasynaptic group I mGluRs that are required to trigger
this form of plasticity. mGluR LTD can also be elicited by
bath application of group I mGluR agonists such as DHPG
(Bellone and Luscher, 2005; Huber et al, 2000, 2001). Group
I mGluRs (mGluR1 and mGluR5) are defined by their
capacity to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis and
thereby produce diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate.
Although mGluR1 is the principal receptor implicated in the
induction of mGluR LTD in the ventral tegmental area
(VTA), cerebellum, and neostriatum, mGluR5 has been
implicated
in
the
hippocampus,
cortex,
and
nucleus
accumbens (Anwyl, 2006).
The intracellular signaling pathways responsible for
mGluR LTD have not been extensively examined. PKC

(De Zeeuw et al, 1998; Linden and Connor, 1991) and the
VTA (Bellone and Luscher, 2005), but perhaps not in the
hippocampus (Huang and Hsu, 2006). Other signaling
proteins suggested to be important for mGluR LTD include
the MAPKs p38, Erk, and Jnk (Gallagher et al, 2004; Li et al,
2007; Rush et al, 2002), tyrosine phosphatases (Huang and
Hsu, 2006; Moult et al, 2006), and phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (Hou and Klann, 2004) but how these various
enzymes might lead to a long-lasting decrease in synaptic
strength is unknown.
Similar to NMDAR-dependent LTD, mGluR LTD in the
hippocampus and cerebellum appears to involve clathrin-
dependent endocytosis of AMPARs (Snyder et al, 2001;
Wang and Linden, 2000; Xiao et al, 2001). For cerebellar
mGluR LTD, a large body of work is consistent with a
specific molecular model in which mGluR activation due to
parallel fiber stimulation combined with calcium influx due
to climbing fiber activation results in activation of PKCa
and its targeting to synapses via the protein PICK1 (Jorntell
and Hansel, 2006; Perez et al, 2001; Steinberg et al, 2006).
PKCa then phosphorylates Ser880 on GluR2 causing GluR2
to dissociate from the AMPAR-binding proteins GRIP/ABP
and bind to PICK1. This then allows lateral diffusion of the
AMPARs and ultimately internalization (Chung et al, 2003;
Steinberg et al, 2006; Xia et al, 2000). This cascade of events
is significantly different than those believed to occur during
NMDAR-dependent LTD, pointing out that the molecular
mechanisms underlying apparently similar forms of plasti-
city may be cell type-specific. Indeed, mGluR LTD at
excitatory synapses onto dopamine cells in the VTA has
been suggested to involve a selective loss of AMPARs that
lack the GluR2 subunit (Bellone and Luscher, 2005, 2006),
rather than those that contain GluR2.
Another important feature of mGluR LTD, at least in the
hippocampus, is that it appears to be dependent on mGluR-
triggered protein synthesis (Hou and Klann, 2004; Huber
et al, 2000, 2001; Snyder et al, 2001). This link between
protein synthesis and mGluR LTD gained considerable
attention following the report that mice lacking the gene
encoding the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)
exhibited enhanced mGluR LTD in both the hippocampus
(Huber et al, 2002) and the cerebellum (Koekkoek et al,
2005). These mice serve as a model for the Fragile X
syndrome in humans, an X-linked form of mental retarda-
tion, and exhibit several features of the human disorder
(Bear et al, 2004). Surprisingly, the enhanced mGluR LTD
observed in the FMRP knockout mice is independent of
protein synthesis and proteasomal degradation (Hou et al,
2006; Nosyreva and Huber, 2006), cellular processes that
appear crucial for mGluR LTD in wild-type mice. Never-
theless, this potential link between an mGluR-triggered
form of synaptic plasticity and Fragile X syndrome has
focused
attention
on
mGluR
antagonists
as
possible
therapeutic agents for this and other developemental
disorders (Bear et al, 2004).
There are also results consistent with a presynaptic locus
of expression for mGluR LTD (Anwyl, 2006; Nosyreva and
Huber, 2005; Zakharenko et al, 2002). As these forms of
mGluR LTD are still triggered postsynaptically, they must
involve a retrograde messenger, one leading candidate being
12-lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid (Feinmark
et al, 2003). In an attempt to reconcile the observations of a
presynaptic locus of expression of mGluR LTD with the
bulk of the literature describing a postsynaptic locus of
expression, a developmental shift in the mechanisms of
mGluR LTD has been proposed (Nosyreva and Huber,
2005). Specifically, it has been suggested that in slices
prepared from neonatal (P8–P15) animals, mGluR-LTD is
independent of protein synthesis and is due to a presynaptic
modification, whereas in older animals (P21–P35) mGluR
LTD is mediated by a protein synthesis-dependent reduc-
tion in the postsynaptic levels of AMPARs.
Endocannabinoid-Mediated LTD
A major advance over the last decade has been the
demonstration of the existence of endogenous cannabinoids
(termed endocannabinoids) and their roles in modulating
synaptic function (Chevaleyre et al, 2006; Freund et al, 2003;
Kreitzer and Regehr, 2002; Piomelli, 2003; Wilson and
Nicoll, 2002). It is now well established that in a number of
brain regions endocannabinoids are retrograde messengers
that are released by postsynaptic cells in response to strong
depolarization
and/or
activation
of
G-protein-coupled
receptors (eg, mGluRs and muscarinic receptors) and
function to transiently inhibit transmitter release (for
B0.5–1 min) at either excitatory or inhibitory synpases
via activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors.
Much of the mechanistic work on the transient synaptic
effects of endocannabinioids was performed in the hippo-
campus and cerebellum, synapses that are often thought to
be prototypic of synapses throughout the brain. It was
therefore surprising when a form of LTD that required
endocannabinoids, (so-called endocannabinoid-mediated
LTD; eCB-LTD) was observed in the glutamatergic synapses
onto medium spiny neurons in the striatum as well as at
synapses between layer V pyramidal neurons (Gerdeman
et al, 2002; Robbe et al, 2002a; Sjostrom et al, 2003). In the
hippocampus, in contrast, endocannabinoids mediate a
form of LTD at inhibitory, but not excitatory, synapses
(Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2004). In the dorsal striatum, eCB-
LTD requires postsynaptic activation of group I mGluRs,
L-type calcium channels and D2 dopamine receptors (Choi
and Lovinger, 1997; Kreitzer and Malenka, 2005, 2007;
Pisani et al, 2005; Sung et al, 2001; Tang et al, 2001)
(Figure 3). This leads to the production most likely of
anandamide (Ade and Lovinger, 2007), which activates
presynaptic CB1 receptors. However, prolonged activation
of these CB1 receptors alone is not sufficient to elicit eCB-
LTD; concomitant presynaptic activity is also required, a
requirement that likely accounts for the input specificity of
this form of plasticity (Singla et al, 2007). Another
important feature of eCB-LTD in the dorsal striatum is
that it appears to be restricted to the medium spiny neurons
that primarily express D2 dopamine receptors and is not
present at excitatory synapses on cells expressing D1
receptors (Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007; but see Wang
et al, 2006). This cell-restricted expression of eCB-LTD
may have important functional implications, a topic to be
discussed below.
In the nucleus accumbens (NAc), eCB-LTD also requires
postsynaptic activation of group I mGluRs and is modulated
by drugs of abuse (Fourgeaud et al, 2004; Mato et al, 2004;
Robbe et al, 2002b). In the cortex, eCB-LTD can be elicited

by a spike-timing-dependent protocol (Sjostrom et al, 2003)
but does not depend on postsynaptic activation of mGluRs
and surprisingly, requires coincident activation of presy-
naptic NMDARs. LTD in the cerebellum was also reported
to depend on retrograde endocannabinoid signaling (Safo
and Regehr, 2005), but the mechanistic basis for this
observation is still unclear, since, as discussed above,
cerebellar LTD is expressed postsynaptically.
Metaplasticity
Metaplasticity refers to a higher-order form of synaptic
plasticity in which synaptic activity, which by itself does not
directly affect synaptic efficacy, leads to a persistent change
in the direction or magnitude of subsequent activity-
dependent synaptic plasticity. In other words, metaplasti-
city is the ‘plasticity of plasticity’ (Abraham and Bear, 1996;
Bear et al, 1987). The best-studied examples of metaplas-
ticity are those in which prior activity shifts the threshold
for LTP and LTD induction. For example, in the hippo-
campus, repetitive activation of NMDARs in a manner that
does not elicit LTP or LTD can nonetheless elicit a rapid
shift in plasticity thresholds such that LTP becomes difficult
to elicit and LTD induction is favored (Huang et al, 1992;
Wang and Wagner, 1999). A potential functional role for
metaplasticity has been demonstrated by modifying the
level of activity during the development of the visual cortex
in vivo (Philpot et al, 2001, 2003, 2007). This causes shifts in
the thresholds for LTP and LTD in cells in visual cortex
presumably due to changes in the stoichiometry of synaptic
NMDARs. As discussed below, such changes in synaptic
plasticity may importantly contribute to the experience-
dependent plasticity of ocular dominance following mani-
pulation of the visual environment.
Synaptic Scaling: A Form of Homeostatic
Plasticity
Theoretically, without additional stabilizing mechanisms,
activity-dependent forms of plasticity such as LTP and LTD
could drive neural circuit activity towards epileptogenic
excitation or complete quiescence. Synaptic scaling is
considered a form of homeostatic plasticity that counters
potentially maladaptive effects of long-term synapse-spe-
cific
plasticity
by
globally
affecting
the
transmission
through all synapses on a given neuron (Turrigiano and
Nelson, 2004). In terms of its basic properties and under-
lying mechanisms, this form of synaptic plasticity contrasts
dramatically with the forms of LTP and LTD we have
discussed thus far.
Synaptic scaling occurs when network activity is drama-
tically decreased or increased for prolonged (4B12–24 h)
periods of time. Decreased activity (due to blockade of
synaptic transmission or spiking) causes an increase in the
strength of all excitatory synapses onto excitatory neurons,
whereas increased activity (generally induced by partially
blocking inhibitory synapses) reduces the strength of all
excitatory synapses (Turrigiano et al, 1998). Importantly,
the relative strengths of individual synpases appear to be
maintained even though global synaptic input is signifi-
cantly altered.
Relatively little is known about the molecular mechan-
isms underlying synaptic scaling other than it involves
changes in the number of AMPARs (and NMDARs) at
individual synapses (Perez-Otano and Ehlers, 2005; Turri-
giano and Nelson, 2004; Watt et al, 2000) and likely
presynaptic changes as well (Burrone and Murthy, 2003;
Burrone et al, 2002). Recently, evidence has been presented
supporting a role for secreted factors in the induction of
homeostatic plasticity, suggesting that key triggers for this
form of plasticity may not be cell autonomous. Specifically,
secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis
factor-a from glial cells appears to be necessary for the
increase in the level of synaptic AMPARs caused by
extended periods of activity blockade (Beattie et al, 2002;
Stellwagen et al, 2005; Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006). In
addition, there is evidence suggesting a role for secreted
BDNF in driving the opposite form of synaptic scaling; the
decrease in synaptic strengths caused by extended periods
of increased network acitivity (Rutherford et al, 1998;
Turrigiano, 2006).
FUNCTIONAL ROLES OF LTP AND LTD
Although LTP and LTD are prime candidate mechanisms
underlying many different forms of experience-dependent
plasticity, it is important to remember that they are

What enzyme generates the endocannabinoids is not known; one
candidate is PLCb. Co-activation of postsynaptic dopamine D2-type
receptors (D2R) enhances endocannabinoid production and the subse-
quent induction of presynaptic LTD, mediated through activation of
presynaptic CB1 receptors (CB1R). (From Kreitzer and Malenka, 2005.)

patterns of activity can elicit bidirectional control over
synaptic strength. Establishing a causal connection between
a specific form of synaptic plasticity and the behavioral
consequences of specific experiences remains a daunting
task. Nevertheless, over the last decade, significant advances
have been made in connecting synaptic plasticity to a
number of different types of adaptive experience-dependent
plasticity. Furthermore, it has become increasingly clear
that understanding the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity
may provide important insights into the pathophysiology of
a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders and also point the
way toward novel therapeutic approaches. In the following
sections, we will briefly provide examples that demonstrate
that LTP and LTD do occur in vivo in response to
experience and may play a causal role in mediating the
consequences of experience.
Hippocampal-Dependent Plasticity and Learning
Given that LTP was first described in the hippocampus, a
structure well established to be critically important for
declarative memory (Squire et al, 2004), it is not surprising
that over the last three decades there has been a major effort
aimed at demonstrating a role for hippocampal LTP in
encoding new memories (Martin et al, 2000; Morris, 2006).
Correlations have been observed between defective hippo-
campal synaptic plasticity and defective hippocampal-
dependent memory tasks upon perturbation of a number
of proteins which function in synaptic plasticity, either
pharmacologically, or through gene knockout (Lynch, 2004;
Martin et al, 2000; Morris, 2006). For example, rodents in
which NMDAR antagonists were infused into the hippo-
campus (Morris and Frey, 1997), as well as mice lacking
expression of the NMDAR subunit NR1 in the forebrain
(Tsien et al, 1996), are defective both in LTP and certain
types of spatial learning. Furthermore, mice in which the
specific NMDAR subunit NR2B was overexpressed to
enhance
NMDAR
function
were
reported
to
display
enhanced LTP and enhanced spatial learning (Tang et al,
1999). Recently, more compelling evidence for a role of
synaptic plasticity in hippocampal-dependent learning has
been presented. During an inhibitory avoidance task, LTP
could be recorded in vivo in a subset of hippocampal CA1
pyramidal cells (Whitlock et al, 2006). This demonstrated
that the patterns of activity generated during a real learning
task were sufficient to elicit LTP. Perhaps even more
convincing was the demonstration that in vivo infusion of a
PKMz
inhibitor
into
the
hippocampus
abolished
the
maintenance of LTP and simultaneously the storage of a
long-lasting spatial memory (Pastalkova et al, 2006). These
findings strongly suggest that maintained LTP was required
for the engram that stored the key spatial information.
In addition to its role as a key component of the
mechanisms underlying the encoding of declarative mem-
ories, hippocampal NMDAR-dependent LTP (as well as
LTD) may provide important insights into the pathophy-
siology and potential treatment of major mental illnesses.
For example, a leading hypothesis for the pathophysiology
of schizophrenia posits a dysfunction in glutamatergic
synapses, in particular a hypofunction of NMDARs (Coyle
and Tsai, 2004; Javitt, 2006; McCullumsmith et al, 2004;
Tamminga, 1998). Thus, understanding the signaling events
downstream of NMDAR activation may provide important
insights into this devastating disease. A role for dysfunc-
tions in LTP and/or LTD mechanisms as possible con-
tributors
to
schizophrenia
is
also
attractive
in
that
schizophrenia likely involves neurodevelopmental abnorm-
alities (Lewis and Levitt, 2002) and these phenomena play
an important role in the early postnatal development of
neural circuitry (see below). Indeed, genetic variation in
calcineurin, which is thought to play an important role in
NMDAR-dependent LTD, has been associated with schizo-
phrenia (Gerber et al, 2003).
Another example of the potential importance of studying
LTP and LTD comes from investigation into the therapeutic
mechanisms of drugs used to treat bipolar disorder. Drugs
such as lithium, valproate, and lamotrigine have been
reported to have significant effects on the phosphorylation
of AMPAR subunits and affect their surface expression (Du
et al, 2003, 2004, 2007; Gray et al, 2003). These findings
suggest that these drugs may somehow tap into the same
mechanisms that have evolved to generate LTP and LTD
and also point to novel approaches for the development of
new therapeutic agents that may prove efficacious for
treatment of this illness.
Experience-Dependent Plasticity in the
Developing Sensory Cortex
Sensory receptive fields in the cortex are modified by early
postnatal
experience
and
the
link
between
synaptic
plasticity and these forms of experience-dependent plasti-
city in sensory systems is becoming increasingly established
(Foeller and Feldman, 2004; Karmarkar and Dan, 2006;
Malenka and Bear, 2004). For example, a strong connection
between
synaptic
plasticity
and
experience-dependent
plasticity has been established in the visual system during
the shift in ocular dominance caused by monocular
deprivation (MD) (Foeller and Feldman, 2004; Karmarkar
and Dan, 2006; Malenka and Bear, 2004). MD induces
biochemical changes in AMPAR subunits in visual cortex
that appear identical to those elicited during NMDAR-
dependent LTD (Heynen et al, 2003) and visual cortical
slices obtained from monocularly deprived animals show
greatly reduced LTD (Crozier et al, 2007; Heynen et al,
2003), suggesting that LTD was elicited in vivo. Further-
more, in vivo recordings demonstrated that MD caused a
rapid decrease in the visually evoked potential (VEP) from
the deprived eye and a slower enhancement of the VEP from
the open eye (Frenkel and Bear, 2004). Importantly,
completely blocking activity in the deprived eye prevented
the depression of the VEP demonstrating that this depres-
sion required retinal activity and, like LTD, was therefore
activity-dependent (Frenkel and Bear, 2004).
Similar results have been obtained in somatosensory
barrel cortex in that sensory deprivation by whisker
trimming or plucking causes a weakening of synaptic
responses in layer 2/3 cells and an occlusion of LTD (Allen
et al, 2003). This appears to be due to alterations in the
patterns of pre- and postsynaptic spiking in vivo in a
manner that is ideal for generating spike-timing-dependent
LTD (Celikel et al, 2004). LTP mechanisms, on the other
hand, appear to be important for the strengthening of
synapses in developing barrel cortex due to early postnatal

experience. In vivo experience drives recombinant GluR1
into barrel cortex synapses in a manner similar to that
which occurs during NMDAR-dependent LTP, whereas
expression of a short peptide that inhibits delivery of
endogenous AMPARs blocks the experience-dependent
increase in synaptic strength (Takahashi et al, 2003) as
does a dominant-negative form of the synaptic scaffold
protein PSD-95 (Ehrlich and Malinow, 2004). Thus, as
predicted by theoretical considerations (Bienenstock et al,
1982; Stent, 1973), LTP and LTD mechanisms appear to be
critically involved in early neural circuit development and it
is not difficult
to
imagine how disruption
in these
mechanisms might contribute to a host of neurodevelope-
mental disorders such as autism (Geschwind and Levitt,
2007; Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003).
Synaptic Plasticity and Fear Conditioning
Pavlovian fear conditioning is a form of associative memory
that depends on the amygdala for its induction and
maintenance (Sigurdsson et al, 2007). It occurs when a
neutral stimulus (such as a tone) is temporally paired with a
strong noxious stimulus (such as an electric shock) creating
a memory trace, the consequences of which are that the
neutral stimulus elicits the learned fear response. Consider-
able evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that LTP at
sensory inputs to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala is
necessary and perhaps sufficient for establishing this
engram (Sigurdsson et al, 2007). NMDAR-dependent LTP
can be induced at cortical and thalamic inputs into the
lateral amygdala, both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, fear
conditioning induces synaptic potentiation at these sy-
napses, and this increase in synaptic strength occludes
further induction of LTP (McKernan and Shinnick-Galla-
gher, 1997; Rogan et al, 1997; Tsvetkov et al, 2002). Like
NMDAR-dependent LTP in the hippocampus, fear con-
ditioning has also been shown to lead to the insertion of
new AMPARs at thalamic input synapses onto lateral
amygdala neurons (Rumpel et al, 2005) and perhaps most
convincingly, expression of a peptide that prevents the LTP-
induced incorporation of AMPARs at synapses abolished
acquisition of this form of associative memory (Rumpel
et al, 2005).
NMDARs in the amgydala are also involved in the
extinction of learned fear, which can be conceptualized as a
different form of learning (Myers and Davis, 2002).
Furthermore, acute treatment with D-cycloserine, a partial
agonist of NMDARs, enhances the learning processes that
are responsible for fear extinction via actions in the
amygdala (Walker et al, 2002). On the basis of these
observations, clinical trials have been initiated using D-
cycloserine in combination with behavioral therapy to
enhance the extinction of fear in phobic patients (Hofmann
et al, 2006; Otto et al, 2007; Ressler et al, 2004). Results to
date suggest that the administration of D-cycloserine either
before or shortly after exposure to fearful cues does in fact
enhance the extinction of the anxiety previously associated
with specific cues. Thus, the study of the neural substrates
of learned fear and its extinction is a compelling example of
how research on the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity has
directly led to a potential novel treatment for common
psychiatric disorders.
Synaptic Plasticity in Dopamine Circuits
The defining characteristic of drug addiction is persistent
and compulsive seeking and ingestion of drugs despite
adverse consequences. Over the last decade, a leading
hypothesis has been that an important neural substrate
of
addiction,
in
particular
relapse,
is
long-term
associative memory processes occurring in several neural
circuits
that
receive
input
from
midbrain
dopamine
neurons (Everitt and Robbins, 2005; Hyman et al, 2006).
In other words, it is thought that addictive drugs can usurp
the normal adaptive mechanisms underlying reward-based
learning.
The most well-established key site of action of addictive
drugs is the mesolimbic dopamine system consisting of the
VTA and the NAc. Excitatory synaptic transmission in these
structures is critical for mediating several forms of long-
lasting, drug-induced behavioral plasticity (Everitt and
Wolf, 2002; Hyman and Malenka, 2001). It, therefore, has
been reasonable to hypothesize that plasticity at these
synapses plays an important role in mediating some of the
behavioral consequences of exposure to drugs of abuse
(Wolf, 1998).
Indeed, it is now established that various forms of LTP
and LTD can be elicited at excitatory synapses in the VTA
and NAc (Gerdeman et al, 2003; Kauer, 2004; Kelley, 2004;
Thomas and Malenka, 2003). Furthermore, administration
of a single dose of several different classes of drugs of abuse
causes
a significant increase
in synaptic strength at
excitatory synapses onto dopamine cells in the VTA (Faleiro
et al, 2004; Saal et al, 2003; Ungless et al, 2001). This
increase shares mechanisms with LTP in the VTA and
appears to involve upregulation of AMPARs (Ungless et al,
2001). This drug-induced ‘LTP’ appears to play a functional
role in triggering or mediating some drug-induced beha-
vioral adaptations, as both conditioned place preference
and behavioral sensitization are blocked by injection of
glutamate receptor antagonists into the VTA (Harris and
Aston-Jones, 2003; Vanderschuren and Kalivas, 2000). In
addition, conditioned place preference, as well as the
synaptic potentiation that is observed following cocaine
administration, are impaired in GluR1 knockout mice
(Dong et al, 2004), with the caveat that these mice still
exhibit robust behavioral sensitization in response to
repeated exposure to psychostimulants (Dong et al, 2004;
Vekovischeva et al, 2001).
While drugs of abuse have been observed to induce LTP
in the VTA, LTD has been observed in the NAc following
chronic in vivo cocaine administration (Thomas et al,
2001). Consistent with a functional role for this LTD in
addiction, injection of glutamate receptor antagonists into
the NAc abolishes the expression of behavioral sensitization
(Kelley, 2004). Furthermore, amphetamine-induced beha-
vioral sensitization and LTD in the NAc were both abolished
by injection into the NAc of inhibitors of AMPAR
endocytosis (Brebner et al, 2005). Interestingly, overexpres-
sion of GluR1 in the NAc (mimicking an ‘LTP’-like
condition) facilitates the extinction of cocaine-seeking
(Sutton et al, 2003) and even makes cocaine aversive in a
conditioned place preference assay (Kelz et al, 1999).
Recently, it has also been reported that cocaine self-
administration abolishes the ability to induce LTD in the

administration
of
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cocaine impairs the gene-
ration of eCB-LTD (Fourgeaud et al, 2004; Mato et al, 2004;
Robbe et al, 2002b). Thus, drugs of abuse may elicit certain
forms of synaptic plasticity in specific circuits while
simultaneously impairing plasticity in other circuits.
Synaptic plasticity in the dorsal striatum has also been
correlated with certain learned behaviors, in particular in
motor control (Gubellini et al, 2004; Pisani et al, 2005). In
this context, it is important to note that two independent
striatal circuits are thought to exist, the so-called ‘direct’
and ‘indirect’ pathways, which subserve different functions
in motor control (Bolam et al, 2000). Indirect pathway
medium spiny neurons (MSNs) project to the lateral globus
pallidus and primarily express D2 dopamine receptors while
direct pathway MSNs project to the substantia nigra and
express D1 dopamine receptors. As mentioned in the
section on eCB-LTD, this form of plasticity is primarily
restricted to the indirect pathway MSNs and is absent in
Parkinson’s disease models (Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007).
However,
in
slices
from
dopamine-depleted
animals,
indirect pathway eCB-LTD can be rescued by a D2 receptor
agonist or pharmacological inhibitors of endocannabinoid
degradation. Remarkably, administration of these drugs
together in vivo dramatically reduces Parkinsonian motor
deficits suggesting that endocannabinoid-mediated depres-
sion of indirect pathway synapses has a critical role in
motor control and may be a valuable target for therapy of
striatal-based brain disorders (Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007).
This works also points out the potential power of examining
the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and placing them in
the context of the neural circuits in which they are found.
Future Directions
We have attempted to briefly review the enormous field of
synaptic plasticity research in a concise and accessible
manner so that by the end of this article, readers will have a
reasonably up to date knowledge of current thinking about
the mechanisms underlying the major forms of synaptic
plasticity in the mammalian brain and a sense of what their
in vivo functions might be. By necessity we have had to
leave out important topics such as how synaptic activity
modulates NMDAR-mediated synaptic responses (eg, Mor-
ishita et al, 2005), inhibitory synaptic responses (Chevaleyre
et al, 2006), or the intrinsic excitability of neurons (Xu and
Kang, 2005; Zhang and Linden, 2003), all of which will have
profound effects on neural circuit function. Furthermore,
several
compelling
examples
that
correlate
long-term
synaptic plasticity with experience-dependent modifications
in behavior have been left out, such as the role of cerebellar
LTD in motor learning (Boyden et al, 2004; Ito, 2002;
Jorntell and Hansel, 2006).
This review should also make clear that while extensive
progress has been made, much remains unknown. Even for
the most established forms of plasticity, NMDAR-depen-
dent LTP and LTD in the CA1 region of the hippocampus,
we
still
know
little
about
the
details
of
the
signal
transduction pathways triggering these forms of plasticity
and which specific proteins are being modified to cause the
changes in synaptic efficacy. We also know little about the
molecular mechanisms underlying the structural changes in
synapses that seem to accompany LTP and LTD. With the
accumulation of evidence demonstrating that long-term
synaptic modifications do in fact play important roles in a
host of adaptive brain functions, we believe there is strong
justification to continue efforts toward establishing the
detailed molecular basis of the various forms of synaptic
plasticity. This is particularly important because, as we have
tried to make clear, such knowledge is likely to have a major
impact on our understanding and treatment of a wide range
of brain disorders.
What direction do we envision the field taking in the near
future? By definition, synaptic plasticity is an electrophy-
siological phenomenon. Only by recording synaptic re-
sponses can the investigator be sure that synaptic function
has been modified. Until relatively recently, most electro-
physiological studies depended on pharmacological manip-
ulations of proteins, an approach that was aided by the use
of genetically modified mice. Thus far, gene knockout
experiments addressing the function of B200 genes have
been reported and close to 80% of these report effects on
synaptic transmission or plasticity (Grant, 2006). With the
growing consensus that NMDAR-dependent LTP is primar-
ily mediated by an increase in postsynaptic AMPARs, while
LTD is associated with loss of AMPARs from the PSD, there
also has been an increased contribution of cell biologists
who have focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying
the changes in the levels of postsynaptic receptors as well as
the changes in synaptic structure that occur. Indeed, a close
interdependence has emerged between electrophysiologists
and cell biologists and this has dramatically impacted the
field. Thus, electrophysiologists are increasingly making use
of tools that enable overexpression, knockdown, and
molecular replacement of target proteins both in vitro and
in vivo (eg, Schluter et al, 2006). These advances are
enabling a true molecular dissection of the mechanisms
underlying plasticity of mammalian brain synapses.
Recent advances in high-throughput technologies, such as
gene-chip microarrays for mRNA profiling and advanced
mass spectrometry for identification of multiple proteins in
a mixed population, have enabled the identification of the
molecular components of many biological phenomena and
contributed significantly to understanding their regulation.
Furthermore, the recent advent of ‘systems biology’ has
contributed a number of conceptual advances that enable
clearer interpretation of the complex interaction networks
observed in signal transduction cascades (Alon, 2006).
These advances have so far only lightly impacted the field of
synaptic plasticity (Pocklington et al, 2006), but we envision
that they will have increasing influence in the near future,
despite the technical difficulties that are encountered when
trying to apply these approaches to the inherently complex
preparations used in the study of synaptic plasticity.
What might we gain from such studies? A clearer picture
of the molecules which participate in the processes under-
lying the different forms of synaptic plasticity, and the
dynamics of their activation and interactions, would enable
the formulation of much more sophisticated models of the
events underlying the triggering, expression, and main-
tenance of specific forms of synaptic plasticity. This in turn
would create a strong foundation for focused efforts aimed
at identifying the central pathways mediating synaptic

REVIEW
plasticity and assaying their relevance to the phenomenon
measured electrophysiologically.
By combining electrophysiological, molecular, cell biolo-
gical and proteomic approaches, we envision that the next
few decades will bring further clarification of the detailed
molecular mechanisms underlying the major forms of
synaptic plasticity that we have discussed in this review.
The use of more sophisticated molecular and genetic
manipulations, in particular, the development of mouse
lines with highly restricted expression of transgenes that
can be turned on or off with fine temporal control, will
simultaneously facilitate the examination of the neural
circuit basis of behavior. Together, we believe these
approaches will allow sophisticated manipulation of synap-
tic plasticity mechanisms in highly restricted neural circuits
and thereby greatly advance our understanding of how
synaptic plasticity mediates both adaptive and pathological
experience-dependent plasticity. Applying these same ap-
proaches to disease models should yield new insights into
the molecular pathology of diseases of the synapse such as
addiction, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s diseases and also
pave the way toward the development of novel and more
efficacious treatments.

Limb proportions show 
developmental plasticity in 
response to embryo movement

Animals have evolved limb proportions adapted to different environments, but it is not yet clear to what 
extent these proportions are directly influenced by the environment during prenatal development. The 
developing skeleton experiences mechanical loading resulting from embryo movement. We tested the 
hypothesis that environmentally-induced changes in prenatal movement influence embryonic limb 
growth to alter proportions. We show that incubation temperature influences motility and limb bone 
growth in West African Dwarf crocodiles, producing altered limb proportions which may, influence post-
hatching performance. Pharmacological immobilisation of embryonic chickens revealed that altered 
motility, independent of temperature, may underpin this growth regulation. Use of the chick also 
allowed us to merge histological, immunochemical and cell proliferation labelling studies to evaluate 
changes in growth plate organisation, and unbiased array profiling to identify specific cellular and 
transcriptional targets of embryo movement. This disclosed that movement alters limb proportions 
and regulates chondrocyte proliferation in only specific growth plates. This selective targeting is related 
to intrinsic mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) pathway activity in individual growth plates. Our 
findings provide new insights into how environmental factors can be integrated to influence cellular 
activity in growing bones and ultimately gross limb morphology, to generate phenotypic variation 
during prenatal development.
A huge diversity of limb specializations exists in nature. All tetrapods (vertebrates with limbs having digits, ances-
trally) possess an equivalent basic limb design, comprising skeletal elements that originate during embryonic 
development from the three major limb regions (the stylopod, zeugopod and autopod)1. These elements are 
tailored in their proportions to fulfil a range of roles2–4, first emerge during prenatal development to characterise 
each species5,6, and also vary to some extent within species7–10. It is well established that natural selection has led 
to limb proportions that are adapted to improve locomotor performance in specific environments on an evolu-
tionary time-scale11–14. However, the extent to which these limb proportions are also influenced by shorter-term 
alterations in the environment within the lifetime of a single organism has historically not been as well resolved.
Dramatic evidence has recently emerged which indicates that environmental cues engender profound changes 
in behaviour and musculoskeletal form post-natally. These changes are analogous to adaptive changes inferred 
in evolution and are seen, for example, in the modification of bone shape and limb function necessary for the 
terrestrialization of Polypterus fish15. Morphological changes including alterations in limb/extremity proportions 
have also been observed in mammals raised in different climates16,17. We speculate that this phenotypic plasticity 
during prenatal periods of ontogeny could also confer an ability to incorporate shorter-term environmental input 
into the generation of variation even prior to birth/hatching. Whether such interactions between environmental 
input and ‘intrinsic’ aspects of developmental regulation facilitate phenotypic variation in limb morphology dur-
ing prenatal development has not however previously been explored.
Morphological diversity is observed across locations with divergent climates in a variety of species, such as extinct 
crocodylomorphs (relatives of extant Crocodylia)18. Inter-specific adaptation for smaller surface area to body size 
ratios in cooler climates (“Allen’s rule”), often achieved through reductions in limb length, is also widespread16,19. 
Intriguingly, intra-species variation in limb form in individuals from thermally divergent locations has also

been observed in lizards but has yet to be explained8. Phenotypic differences seen in the North American lizard 
Sceloporus occidentalis include longer limbs relative to body size in individuals from warmer locations, and a 
reduction in relative limb length in cooler, more northern populations. Like many reptilian species, Sceloporus 
is not incubated by a parent and its incubation conditions are determined by the environment. Incubation tem-
perature has previously been shown to influence embryonic motility and skeletal growth in chickens20. Changes 
in embryonic limb bone growth induced by pharmacologically stimulating embryo motility alone suggest that 
mechanical input, rather than temperature per se, regulates skeletal growth in embryonic limbs21–25.
Herein, we explore the hypothesis that developmental plasticity during prenatal stages of ontogeny allows for 
variation in limb proportions to emerge via environmentally-triggered alterations in movement. This hypothesis 
was tested in experiments using embryonic crocodiles (Osteolaemus tetraspis Cope 1861) and chickens (Gallus 
gallus). Previous studies in embryonic chickens indicate that altered incubation temperature modulates motil-
ity and limb growth20. This species uses contact incubation by a parent, however, and many birds alter their 
behaviours in different climates to maintain relatively constant incubation temperatures. Incubation at different 
temperatures within chickens is thus less likely to occur naturally26,27. Use of crocodiles, which are ectothermic, 
oviparous and not directly incubated by a parent, in contrast, provide an opportunity to explore whether motility 
and limb proportions are modified by incubation temperature in a model where such thermal variation could 
occur naturally. We specifically tested whether West African Dwarf crocodile embryos incubated at the extremes 
of the normal range for this species (32 °C and 28 °C) exhibited alterations in motility and limb proportions; we 
therefore made measurements of body size, limb length and stylopod, zeugopod and autopod element length. 
The relatively small number of eggs produced in a single Osteolaemus clutch limited our experiment to a single 
time-point, and did not allow for optimization of pharmacological manipulation of embryo movement in this 
species to separate the effects of temperature and embryo motility on limb growth.
Embryonic chickens, a commonly used model for mechanistic studies in limb development in which methods 
for pharmacological alteration of motility are well established and for which species-specific reagents are read-
ily available27–29, were used to further explore our hypothesis. Specifically, we tested whether pharmacological 
immobilization alone alters limb proportions, when temperature is maintained constant to remove any influence 
it may have on embryo movement as a variable. Accordingly, limb element lengths were measured at selected 
time-points during development and their growth monitored in some experiments by repeat MRI imaging of 
individual control and immobilised chicken embryos to examine whether pharmacologically-induced alterations 
in movement alone produced modifications in limb proportions.
During early limb development, individual skeletal elements are laid down as cartilage condensations. Limb 
proportions emerge as a result of the size of the initial condensation28 and primarily due to later changes in their 
growth by endochondral ossification5, the process by which limb skeletal elements grow longitudinally29. Each 
element forms initially as a cartilage model that elongates via a controlled process of chondrocyte proliferation, 
maturation and hypertrophy before replacement by bone during ossification30–32. Muscle contraction has been 
implicated as a regulator of embryonic long bone growth by endochondral ossification25,33–36, but the molecular 
and cellular targets of such regulation have not been fully characterised. Use of the embryonic chick as a model 
allowed us to identify the mechanisms which underpin regulation of limb proportions by embryonic move-
ment by examining the impact of altered embryo movement on both cellular behaviour and gene expression in 
individual growth plates. Measurements of growth plate zones widths, the expression of proliferative markers 
in the growth plate were made, and the size of hypertrophic chondrocytes from control and immobilised limbs 
was used to investigate the primary effect of embryo immobilisation on longitudinal growth. Unbiased array 
profiling was then used to evaluate gene expression in control and immobilised femur and tibiotarsus growth 
plates at selected time points during development. Using an inducible method for embryo immobilisation along 
with longitudinal tracking of limb growth has allowed us to investigate, and separate, changes in gene expression 
which are associated with determining the capacity of a growth plate cartilage to respond, sense and coordinate 
a subsequent growth response to mechanical cues. Our findings provide evidence that environmental factors, 
and not only genetic pre-specification may differentially influence limb element growth during prenatal develop-
ment and thereby introduce phenotypic variation, which provides a novel insight into the potential evolutionary

Temperature influences embryonic crocodile limb proportions. 
We investigated whether temper-
ature alters motility and limb growth in the West African Dwarf crocodile. Embryos were incubated at 28 °C 
and 32 °C from embryonic day (E) 10–70. Embryo motility was monitored at E44, 48, 51 and 55. Snout-vent 
length, total limb length and total limb and limb element lengths corrected against body size were measured from 
embryos euthanised at E70. Embryos incubated at 28 °C were less motile when monitored at stage E51, close 
to mid-gestation (88% decrease in frequency of movement, P <​ 0.05, Fig. 1). The relatively heightened activity 
of embryos incubated at 32 °C persisted up until E55, when their large body size may have restricted in ovo 
movement.
Total body size at E70, around hatching age, was significantly smaller in embryos incubated at lower temper-
atures (38% smaller P <​ 0.05). Staging of embryos according to Ferguson’s37 staging series revealed that embryos 
incubated at 28 °C corresponded to stage 27 and E60–63, while those incubated at 32 °C corresponded to stage 
28, which corresponds to E64–70 (with E70 considered hatching age). Staging at these late developmental stages 
is not based on morphological parameters but rather relative absorption of the yolk sac. A reduction in overall 
limb length was also observed (38% shorter snout-to-vent length and 44% reduction of limb length, P <​ 0.001 and 
0.0001). Critically, the lower incubation temperature did not generate a uniform deficit in growth, where all ele-
ments might be expected to be affected equally, but rather disproportionately affected the length of specific skel-
etal elements over others, to change relative limb proportions. The hindlimbs in less motile embryos incubated at

28 °C were shorter when corrected for overall body size (10%, P <​ 0.05) and exhibited disproportionately shorter 
tibiae (11%, P <​ 0.05) but longer digits (9%, P <​ 0.05) compared to incubation at 32 °C. Examination at euthanasia 
revealed that all embryos were female, which rules out the possibility of sexual dimorphism in growth between 
temperature groups.
Embryo movement is responsible for altered limb proportions. 
Our data from crocodile embryos 
indicate that some limb regions may be more severely affected than others, but did not establish whether this 
reflected temperature per se or altered movement. Chicken embryos were used for immobilisation studies, during 
which embryo movement was altered pharmacologically while constant 37 °C incubation temperature was main-
tained. Total limb and individual limb element lengths were measured in chicks immobilised between E10–14, 
13–17 and 15–18 and compared to controls. Additionally, total limb and limb element lengths were measured 
in embryos immobilised from E10 onwards by daily MRI imaging between E14–18. Despite the onset of overt 
movement from E4.5 in the chick embryo, and “coordinated” movement from E7 onwards38, micro-CT-based 
measurements showed that total limb growth was unchanged by immobility imposed between E10–14.
Pelvic limb length was reduced by the absence of movement only at later time points, between E13–16 and 
E15–18 (by 22% and 12% vs. vehicle-treated control, P <​ 0.001 and <​ 0.05 respectively; Fig. 2). Intriguingly,

immobility between E13–17 significantly reduced both femur (24%, P <​ 0.001) and tarsometatarsus (TMT; 38%, 
P <​ 0.001) lengths while the tibiotarsus (TBT) was not significantly affected (Fig. 3). The TMT was most affected 
by immobilization between E15–18 (16% shorter compared to 12% in the TBT, P <​ 0.05), whereas in contrast the 
femur was not significantly reduced at this late time point.
MRI allows for non-invasive, longitudinal monitoring of chick development39,40. We used daily MRI scans to 
achieve repeat measures of limb growth between E14 to E18 in individual chicks immobilized from E10. These 
measures of limb and skeletal element length confirmed the existence of a period between E10–13 when lack of 
motility does not modify chick limb growth (see Fig. 2). Immobilisation between E15–18 achieved reductions in 
limb length without modification in eye diameter (a gross index of chick skull development41; note that HH-based 
staging after E13 relies on beak and 3rd digit lengths which are both affected by immobilization. Such staging was 
thus not appropriate). We therefore staged only control chick embryos upon euthanasia after the final scan at E18 
to assess whether cooling of eggs during MR imaging had an impact on development. Measurements of beak and 
3rd digit lengths from these chick embryos corresponded to those of E16 embryos42, indicating that these methods 
introduce a level of developmental delay. The altered limb proportions seen in MR-imaged embryos do however 
correspond closely with measurements made using microCT at E17; their altered limb proportions are consistent 
with selective modification of longitudinal growth by embryo movement.
Longitudinal MRI scans were used to explore the differing effects of chick immobilisation seen in individual 
limb elements at E13–17 and E15–18, and revealed that modifications in growth of each element in response 
to altered movement first emerge at different stages in each element. Longitudinal growth of the TBT showed 
significant reliance on movement only after E17, and the femur prior to E17, whereas TMT length was markedly 
modified by E15 (Fig. 3). Together these data indicate that different elements exhibit differential sensitivity to the 
removal of normal chick motility, which is seemingly unrelated to the proximo-distal sequence of limb element 
emergence.
Growth plate dynamics are influenced by embryo movement. 
We next sought to relate the 
immobilisation-induced changes in limb proportions to modifications in the dynamics of specific growth 
plates. We quantified the widths of the distinct growth plate zones (proliferative/maturing, pre-hypertrophic 
and hypertrophic) in proximal and distal ends of the femur, TBT and TMT in sections from control and

immobilized (from E10 onwards) chick pelvic limbs. Zone width was expressed as a percentage of the total 
growth plate width. Immobilization altered growth plate dynamics selectively in the distal region of both the 
femur and TMT, but not TBT, at E18 (Fig. 4). In contrast, the proximal regions of all elements were unaffected. 
Each growth plate in a given element does not contribute equally to longitudinal growth, and the changes we 
observed were targeted to the growth plate deemed responsible for >​50% longitudinal growth43. No signifi-
cant impact on either TBT growth plate was observed. Thus, differences in sensitivity to external input may be 
intrinsic to different limb regions.
The impact of chick immobility in the affected growth plates at E18 was characterised by a relative expansion 
in the proliferative/maturing zone, with a corresponding narrowing of the pre-hypertrophic zone in femur and 
TMT (Fig. 5). We observed no impact of immobilization in any growth plate at E14 (Fig. 4f). These data suggest a 
correlation between modified growth plate dynamics and the changes in longitudinal growth of specific elements 
and limb proportions observed in immobilized chicks.
Movement drives cellular progression in the growth plate. 
We tested the hypothesis that there is a 
correlation between chick embryo motility and changes in growth plate dynamics by examining cellular behav-
iour in the growth plate in response to immobilisation. We examined the regulation of chondrocyte proliferation, 
apoptosis and hypertrophy in the distal femoral growth plate of chicks immobilized from E10 onwards in com-
parison with control chick embryos. We compared the distribution of cells positive for proliferating cell nuclear 
antigen (PCNA, an S-phase marker) and phosphohistone H3 (a marker of mitosis), expressed as a percentage of 
the total number of cells (DAPI labelled).
Immobility from E10 produced a loss of PCNA labelling at the articular surface, little change in the prolifer-
ative zone and an increase in the number of PCNA positive cells in the prehypertrophic/hypertrophic zone, thus 
widening the region of PCNA labelling (normally restricted to the proliferative zone) by E14 (Fig. 5a–e). This 
was accompanied by a diminution in the number of phosphohistone H3-positive cells (Fig. 5f–j), indicating that

the enlarged population of PCNA-positive cells do not complete the cell cycle and advance normally through the 
growth plate but rather accumulate. These changes were observed at E14, before any measurable impact of motil-
ity on femur length was evident, and were still apparent at E18 (see Supplementary Fig. S1).
Tracking of proliferating cells by BrdU incorporation in E16 chick limbs, 6 days after the onset of immobiliza-
tion, confirmed that immobilisation slowed cellular progression through the growth plate; BrdU-positive cells in 
normal limbs had progressed to the prehypertrophic zone within 4 hours of BrdU administration, but were largely 
restricted to the proliferating zone in immobilised limbs (Fig. 5k–o). The rate of uptake of BrdU (cells per hour) 
was unchanged with immobilisation, suggesting that proliferative arrest in these cells occurs after completion of 
S-phase but prior to mitosis (Supplementary Fig. S2).
We found no alteration in number or distribution of TUNEL-positive cells in control and immobilized chick 
limbs at any time-point (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating no impact on apoptosis. Measurement of chon-
drocyte cell area in regions of the hypertrophic zone adjacent to the chondro-osseous junction also showed no 
modification in hypertrophic expansion after 4 days of immobilization at E14. However, chondrocyte size was 
reduced by more prolonged lack of movement at E18 (21% reduction, P <​ 0.05, see Supplementary Fig. S4). These 
data indicate that movement initially targets specific growth plates by driving completion of the cell cycle within 
the proliferative zone.
Molecular features of the growth response to mechanics. 
Our data suggest that longitudinal growth 
of embryonic limb elements is initially intrinsically regulated; “mechano-sensitive” limb growth is not always a 
feature of ontogeny but is acquired relatively late in development. Our data also suggest that, in the embryonic 
chicken, limb growth becomes responsive to altered embryo movement between E13–15 in the femur, but growth 
of the TBT is affected less severely by mechanics, and not until later time-points. This was exploited in an attempt 
to identify the molecular factors responsible for mechanical regulation of cartilage growth. Transcriptional profil-
ing was performed to identify changes in coordinated gene expression associated with the switch from intrinsic to 
mechanical regulation of cartilage growth. Transcriptional profiles were compared in the distal femur and prox-
imal TBT growth plates of control chicks at E12, 13 and 15 to explore whether changes in gene expression occur 
during the time period when femur growth becomes sensitive to movement but the growth of the TBT does not. 
Additionally, gene expression was compared in the distal femur and proximal TBT of chicks immobilised between 
E10–15 and compared to E15 controls, to explore whether any genes identified by the previous comparison were 
also regulated in expression by embryo movement.
A comparison of control femur and TBT limb elements at E12 and E13 did not reveal any differentially 
expressed genes or pathways between these limb elements. Gene expression in pooled TBT and femur elements 
at E12 and E13 (to maximise statistical power) revealed a small number of modestly differentially expressed 
genes between the two time-points, 4 of which, namely Scube2, BTF3L4 and indirectly HMBG3 (via HMBG2) 
and IGF2BP3 (via links with IFG2), have known associations with endochondral ossification (Table 1). However, 
gene ontology (GO) analysis of these genes revealed enrichment of no distinct pathways or cellular components, 
suggesting this was a stochastic observation. Differences in expression specific to individual limb regions did, 
however, emerge by E15; 58 genes (4 upregulated and 54 downregulated) were found to differ in expression in 
the femur relative to the TBT at this time-point, and belong to specific biological pathways. GO analysis revealed 
enrichment of genes associated with Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signalling among those down-
regulated specifically in the femur at E15 (Fig. 6a,b). The mTOR complex has diverse roles in the regulation of cell 
proliferation and growth and in our analysis appears to be the primary pathway altered between the femur and 
TBT elements at E15, suggesting it may regulate the emergence of limb proportions by specifically modulating the 
growth of those elements sensitive to movement.
We further sought to identify whether the genes which are associated with the acquisition of 
“mechano-responsive” cartilage growth are also involved in the mechano-sensory process, and in coordinating 
the growth response to mechanical stimuli. We compared gene expression in the femur and TBT elements in 
control and DMB-treated limbs at E15. The mTOR associated genes identified by the previous comparison were 
not significantly altered in their expression in either the femur or TBT in response to drug-induced immobilisa-
tion. In contrast, we found that a number of traditionally ‘myogenic’ genes associated with MEF2c were down-
regulated in both the femur and TBT in response to immobilisation (Fig. 7a). These genes are associated with 
actin-mediated cell contraction and have previously been implicated in the mechano-transduction process during 
embryonic limb growth44. However, although the skeletal muscle genes downregulated in response to immobi-
lisation were very similar between limb elements, a number of genes associated with the regulation of chondro-
genesis were altered in expression in the femur but not the TBT. Upstream analysis, which statistically links a 
combined pattern of up/down regulated set of RNAs with pre-existing signatures of drug or protein induced tran-
scriptional responses45,46, identified that these changes are consistent with increased Wnt3a activity in the femur 
in response to immobilisation (Figs 5 and 7b,c). Our data suggest that genes associated with actin-mediated cell 
contraction are regulated in chondrocytes by embryo movement and may, as previously suggested44, contribute 
to sensing and transducing mechanical signals. Our data also suggest that Wnt3a is involved in coordinating 
chondrocyte responses to embryo movement in growth plate cartilage. However, such regulation of growth by 
movement only occurs in limb elements which have lower intrinsic mTOR pathway activity. Our analysis did not 
reveal which effectors of mTOR were responsible for the differences in intrinsic activity.
Discussion
Our data provide evidence to support the hypothesis that the environment influences developmental pathways 
to produce phenotypic variation in limb form during embryonic development. Altered embryo behaviour and 
growth in response to incubation temperature in West African Dwarf crocodiles results in the emergence of 
hindlimb proportions that may, in turn, influence locomotor performance upon hatching, as well as survival in

varying environments9,12,47. There are unfortunately no studies describing adaptive differences in extant crocodil-
ian morphology to warmer or cooler environments. Nonetheless, similar correlation between limb length relative 
to body size and latitude (which is strongly linked to climate) has been observed in extant lizards7, suggesting 
that there is scope for such adaptive prenatal changes to occur in ectothermic, oviparous species. We observed 
that hind limbs in less motile embryos incubated at 28 °C were shorter when corrected for overall body size, with 
relatively shorter tibiae but longer digits compared to those incubated at 32 °C. Extant crocodilian embryos have 
been shown to scale limb proportions isometrically with body size after the very earliest stages of development, 
with negative allometry in the zeugopod (ulna) and positive allometry of the forelimb autopod providing the 
exceptions to this general isometric scaling48. A study which quantified the contribution of the femur, tibia and 
3rd metatarsal to total limb length (digits were excluded) in Alligator mississippiensis from 8 days into incubation 
until hatching age (~70 days) showed that throughout prenatal ontogeny, the femur consistently contributes 43%, 
tibia 36% and 3rd metatarsal 21% to limb length, suggesting that their proportions do not to change39. Applying 
these methods of comparison to our data, we find that the values calculated from Osteolaemus embryos incubated 
at 32 °C are similar, with the femur contributing 40 ±​ 0.3%, tibia 39 ±​ 0.7% and metatarsal 21 ±​ 0.8% to total limb 
length. There are some differences in the values calculated from embryos incubated at 28 °C, in which the femur 
contributes 41 ±​ 1.1%, tibia 34 ±​ 0.9% and metatarsal 24 ±​ 0.9%. It remains to be established whether all autopod 
elements adhere to such isometric scaling during Osteolaemus ontogeny, but we speculate that it is unlikely that 
the differences observed in the relative length of the digits between embryos incubated at 28 °C and 32 °C can be 
explained solely on the basis that development is delayed.
The number of crocodile embryos available limited our study to a single time-point. To date, most studies into 
the embryonic development and limb scaling of crocodilians have focused on Alligator mississippiensis, likely 
due to their availability. Further studies to monitor limb growth throughout prenatal ontogeny in other species 
like Osteolaemus are required to fully understand how incubation temperature influences limb scaling in other 
crocodilians. However, the trend for isometric scaling of hindlimb proportions in Alligator suggests that the 
shorter tibiae and longer digits of Osteolaemus incubated at relatively cool temperatures may be due to differential 
regulation of limb growth at this temperature.
The observed reduction in hindlimb length relative to body size, and the proportional shortening of zeugopod 
and lengthening of autopod elements in crocodile embryos incubated at low temperatures, could be extrapolated 
to produce more “paddle-like” limbs in an extreme case. This has remarkable correspondence to limb adaptations 
to more aquatic environments observed in extinct crocodylomorphs (e.g. those adapted to more aquatic environ-
ments such as thalattosuchians show a trend for reduced zeugopod elements, including ulna, tibia and fibula49). 
The fossil record indicates that climate may have driven phenotypic diversity in crocodilian-line archosaurs, 
with less diverse, more terrestrial adaptations occurring at latitudes closer to the equator, while a greater range of 
diversity was associated with higher latitudes18. Correlation between morphology (i.e. limb length) and latitude/
climate has also been reported in other reptiles and is reminiscent of Allen’s rule in mammals7,8,50. Direct regula-
tion of cartilage growth by temperature has recently been proposed as a potentially comprehensive explanation 
for reduced extremity length and altered limb proportions in cooler climates51. However, direct temperature

Figure 6.  Differential expression of mTOR associated genes characterise femur and TBT elements at E15. 
(a) Upon analysis of E15 femur versus TBT (SAMR analysis), it was noted that 59 genes were differentially 
regulated between these limbs. These included ‘structural constituent of ribosome’ (p <​ 1E-08) and metabolic 
genes. Ingenuity up-stream analysis of this gene-list noted that less mTOR activity (p <​ 1E-09) was predicted 
in the femur, compared with the TBT (i.e. rapamycin being the inhibitor of mTOR) based on analysis of 54/59 
genes in the database. mTOR regulated genes, shown in blue, are expressed at a lower level in E15 femur than 
E15 TBT. (b) The expression of these mTOR regulated genes was not significantly different between limbs 
at E12/13. Note that SLC38A3 expression is omitted from this graph due to its disproportionately higher 
expression level in the femur obscuring the other gene expression values. (c) Expression of the mTOR associated

regulation of limb element growth does not fully explain the proportions we observe in the less motile crocodile 
embryos incubated at cooler temperatures. Although absolute growth of all elements was reduced at the lower 
28 °C incubation temperature and a proportional reduction was seen in zeugopod length, the most peripheral 
autopod elements, which we would expect to be most severely ‘shortened’ by temperature regulation of cartilage 
growth, are instead proportionally elongated, rather than shortened. We suggest that mechanical regulation of 
embryonic bone growth also contributes to the variation in limb form seen in different climates by differentially 
regulating the growth of individual limb regions.
Pharmacological immobilization of embryonic chickens revealed that modulation in pelvic limb growth can 
be achieved by alteration of embryo motility alone, independent of incubation temperature. Our data suggest 
that this can be achieved via selective targeting of chondrocyte proliferation and progression in specific growth 
plates by embryo movement, to achieve changes in limb proportions. Our findings suggest that embryo motil-
ity acts to regulate limb proportions by exerting a differential impact on the growth of individual limb regions. 
This supports the findings of previous studies which showed that the impact of immobilisation on the growth of 
embryonic limb elements is complex, differs in individual limb regions and is partially dependent on the day at 
which immobilisation commences23,24,35,36,52–54. Previous studies by Lamb, et al.36 and Heywood, et al.21 which also 
reported an impact on limb length at E14 or later are consistent with this view. In contrast, Hosseini and Hogg23 
reported an impact on femur and TBT/tibia length from E11 but did not observe any alteration in growth carti-
lage volume until 3 days later, at E14. Germiller and Goldstein55, on the other hand, showed an impact on element 
length and proliferation, without any changes in growth plate zone widths later than E11, from E13 onwards. Our 
use of 5μ​m resolution microCT to make measurements of element length found a significant impact of embryo 
movement only after E14. Despite examining limb growth in response to immobilisation across a very extensive 
period spanning E8–E20, these studies together appear to identify a comparatively short developmental period 
(potentially from E11 to E14) when sensitivity to movement commences. This variation may reflect inaccuracies 
introduced by the different methods used for measuring limb length, variation in the incubation temperature 
maintained between studies, the difficulty of accurately staging immobilised embryos (to allow for consistency) 
or even variation in growth rate between strains of domestic chicken used.
We observed that in limb elements which are not growing rapidly (e.g. the chicken femur between E15–18, 
Fig. 3), there is little scope to alter growth in response to immobilization. However, the differential impact of 
movement on each limb region cannot be fully explained by the region’s growth rate alone; e.g. the length of the 
TMT in chicks is severely affected by immobilization, even at developmental stages when other elements are 
growing more rapidly. Furthermore, our data suggest that “mechano-responsiveness” of longitudinal limb growth 
is not always a feature of ontogeny but is acquired during development. Our longitudinal data gathered from 
MRI analysis support the notion that different limb elements acquire mechanically-driven plasticity in growth 
at different stages. The developmental delay introduced by our imaging protocol means that we cannot ascertain 
exactly when mechano-sensitive growth is likely acquired in each limb element during normal chick develop-
ment, but it certainly seems to differ within each of the individual stylopod, zeugopod and autopod limb regions. 
This developmental delay was ascertained by staging of control embryos after 4 days of MRI imaging, at E18, 
according to the Hamburger and Hamilton staging series42. Staging of DMB-treated embryos using this method 
was not possible as the growth of the traditional anatomical landmarks upon which the grading of late stages is 
based (beak and 3rd digit length) is influenced by embryo immobilisation. However, we observed no difference 
in eye diameter (chosen as a gross index of skull development, as previous studies have identified that the growth 
of craniofacial bones is not influenced by embryo paralysis54) between control and immobilised embryos, which 
suggests that embryo paralysis does not cause an overall developmental delay but rather influences the growth of 
selected musculoskeletal elements. Investigating the impact of immobility on chick growth plate dynamics con-
firmed an impact of altered movement in the distal femur and TMT, but not in either TBT growth plate by E14, 
suggesting that differences in responsiveness to mechanical stimuli are instead intrinsic to different limb regions. 
The impact of altered motility on each individual element, however, differs between the chicken and crocodile 
species considered in this study.
Our analysis identified a population of cells in the proliferative zone of specific growth plates which progress 
slowly through the cell cycle in the absence of movement, and that cell cycle progression is accelerated to com-
plete mitosis, and later differentiate, upon embryonic limb movement. A deficit in hypertrophic expansion, which 
appears to be secondary to the impact on proliferation, is also observed in the absence of normal mechanical 
input. The IGF-1-dependent phase of hypertrophy in particular is known to underpin the differential growth of 
limb elements in species which exhibit dramatic differences in limb proportions56; our data highlight that this 
may also be subject to regulation by movement depending on the intrinsic level of activation of canonical growth 
regulating pathways.
Transcriptional profiling by microarray analysis offers an explanation for why the growth of some elements 
is more severely affected by embryo immobilisation than others at the time-points chosen for this study. The 
inducible nature of pharmacological immobilisation of embryonic chicks, coupled with longitudinal monitoring 
of limb growth, allowed us to identify factors that determine whether a limb element is capable of responding 
to mechanics during prenatal growth. Previous embryo immobilisation studies have identified genes potentially 
involved in mechano-sensation and transduction and the response of embryonic limb growth to paralysis44. It 
was not possible in this study to separate the influence of spontaneous neuronal activity on gene expression from 
the consequent muscle activity that it stimulates. There are compounds which may be used to increase the fre-
quency of embryonic movement, such as 4-aminopyridine, but these also provoke actions at the neuromuscular 
junction. However, the cytoskeleton-associated genes which we found to be altered in expression in immobilised 
limbs (Fig. 7a) have previously been implicated in chondrocyte mechano-transduction in vitro57,58, suggesting 
that this response at least is not dependent upon neuronal activity. Perhaps with the advent of newer methods for

non-invasive imaging and monitoring of embryo movement in ovo39,59,60 it will be possible to better distinguish 
the contributions from muscle-induced mechanical stimuli from those induced by spontaneous neuronal activity.
Our analysis suggests that mechano-sensation and the growth response to mechanical stimuli can be 
de-coupled, and that additional factors exist which determine whether a growth response to mechanical stimuli 
will occur in individual limb regions. One such factor appears, on the basis of our transcriptional profiling of 
these elements, to be the intrinsic degree of mTOR pathway related activity.mTOR is a known regulator of the 
cell cycle and forms two multi-protein complexes known as mTORC1 and mTORC2, which perform different 
functions (Rokutanda, Fujita et al. 2009, Guan, Yang et al. 2014). mTORC1 is known to regulate protein syn-
thesis in response to intrinsic factors such as nutrient and growth factor availability (Chen and Long 2014). 
The function of mTORC2 is less well characterised, but is also thought to regulate cellular metabolism through 
activation of Akt/PKB, and may play a role in cell adhesion or cytoskeletal organisation due to its stimulation of 
cytoskeletal-associated genes including paxillin and F-actin (Chen, Holguin et al. 2015). These complexes there-
fore function to integrate aspects of energy metabolism with the translation of mRNA during cell division. mTOR 
has previously been implicated as a regulator of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation; the Akt-mTOR 
pathway positively regulates chondrocyte proliferation, maturation, matrix production and growth during skel-
etal development (Rokutanda, Fujita et al. 2009). There are, however, conflicting reports on the role of mTORC 
in the growth plate, with some studies reporting that inhibition of mTORC results in impaired chondrocyte 
proliferation, while others report only an impact on hypertrophy (Yang, Yang et al. 2013, Guan, Yang et al. 2014). 
These differences may reflect the relative impact on mTORC1 and mTORC2 signalling following mTOR inhibi-
tion. In our analysis, evidence for significantly lower mTOR pathway activity in the femur but not the TBT at E15 
coincides with our findings showing onset of mechanosensitive growth in the femur only. These analyses also 
reveal a lack of any significant modification in transcriptional signature across E12 and E13 in the TBT and femur, 
suggesting that no marked change in their behaviour is likely to have occurred during this earlier timeframe. 
We propose that reduced mTOR-stimulated growth, likely to occur in response to other intrinsic factors such as 
nutrient availability, confers the ability for cells to be influenced by external, mechanical cues.
Activation of mTOR itself has also been shown by previous studies to be regulated by mechanical stimuli. 
Its activation is stimulated by cyclic loading in primary growth plate chondrocytes, and has been shown to be 
reduced in growth cartilage of pharmacologically immobilised chicks at E17 and in cases of postnatal limb immo-
bilisation in humans52,61,62. However, while mTOR activation status appeared lower in the control femur relative to 
TBT at E15, the expression of genes associated with the mTOR pathway were not altered by immobilisation at E15 
in our study; i.e. the difference between E15 femur and TBT was intrinsic to the femur and appears insensitive to 
gross changes in movement. This suggests that mTOR is likely not directly responsible for mechano-responsive 
growth. Rather, reduction in its activation in the femur may instead allow the influence of other factors, such as 
movement, to impact on growth. This is consistent with our observed changes in the expression of cytoskeletal 
genes associated with actin-mediated cell contraction with immobilisation in both TBT and femur, which previ-
ous studies have identified as a potential mediator in ‘sensing’ or transducing altered mechanical stimuli44. Our 
examination of changes in gene expression by immobilisation are also consistent with previous studies44 in that 
they suggest that the growth response to immobilisation is likely coordinated via Wnt3a activity. Indeed, these 
Wnt-related changes in expression occur in only the femur with immobilisation, consistent with Wnt’s proposed 
function in coordinating the growth response to embryo movement.
Thus, differential intrinsic mTOR activity in individual growth plates appears to help determine whether 
growth responds to external mechanical cues or is regulated only by intrinsic factors such as amino acid availabil-
ity and growth factors. mTOR’s known regulation of protein synthesis during the cell cycle points to its potential 
to impact events in the growth plate proliferative zone. Our exploration of immobilisation-induced changes in 
the proliferative zone suggest that chondrocytes are arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, which involves 
rapid protein synthesis in preparation for mitosis. Our observation that proliferative zone chondrocytes in the 
femur reach S phase at a normal rate (they incorporate BrdU during DNA replication) but fail to, or take longer 
to undergo mitosis strengthens this connection. We therefore propose that developmental downregulation of 
intrinsic mTOR activity results in reduced growth in the absence of embryo movement, and appears to allow the 
capacity for mechanical stimuli to instead drive cell cycle progression in the proliferative zone. Previous studies 
indicate that selection for intrinsic growth regulation can indeed occur at the expense of adaptability to mechan-
ical loading63,64, although it is currently not clear how mTOR signalling would interact with Wnt3a mediation of 
the growth response (this need not be a direct interaction). Selection for different levels of intrinsic mTOR activity 
may offer an explanation for why different elements are more susceptible to growth regulation by mechanical 
stimuli in different species, such as the chicken and crocodile considered in this study.
In mammals, and to a lesser extent birds, the embryonic environment is controlled by a parent and, in the 
absence of pharmacological intervention or pathology, this appears to secure an optimal range of embryo motility 
to produce suitable limb forms, although at a major metabolic cost to the mother65. Many ectothermic oviparous 
species adopt a different reproductive strategy by producing larger numbers of eggs that are not incubated by a 
parent66. The incubation conditions of these eggs are dependent upon the environment and a single animal may 
produce multiple clutches of eggs in a season, and/or bury a single clutch of eggs in a nest containing a temper-
ature gradient67, thereby increasing the chance that at least some embryos will experience ‘optimal’ incubation 
conditions. However, our data suggest that the reproductive strategy of these animals does not rely entirely on 
chance, but that developmental plasticity during the embryonic phase may also engender a robust capacity for 
the embryos of reptiles such as crocodiles (and perhaps other tetrapod species) to adapt their limb proportions 
in ways that may be beneficial in their post-hatching environment. Our findings also suggest that regulation of 
prenatal growth in response to embryo motility is achieved by the control of proliferation in limb growth plates 
which are specified by a mechanism involving intrinsic reduction in mTOR pathway activation.

Materials and Methods
Manipulation of embryo movement. 
All procedures complied with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) 
Act 1986 and were approved by the RVC animal welfare and ethical review body.
Crocodiles.  Crocodile (Osteolaemus tetraspis) eggs from a single clutch were obtained from Crocodiles of the 
World conservation and education centre (Witney, UK) at E10. They were randomly assigned into groups and 
incubated at 28 °C or 32 °C (n =​ 3 per group) with 90% relative humidity. Osteolaemus are a threatened spe-
cies not commonly bred in captivity, which limited the number of fertilised eggs available. Prior data indicate a 
small degree of variation in the limb element lengths of wild crocodilians sampled from the same geographical 
location68. Dupont and Plummer’s method for power and sample size calculations69 therefore indicate that the 
number of embryos required per group to detect a 10% change in limb element length with a power of 0.8 and 
type I error of 0.05 with varying temperature is ≥​1. The chosen temperatures are within the ranges which produce 
viable, predominantly female hatchlings in captivity.
Embryo movement was monitored at intervals throughout incubation by candling the eggs and recording the 
number of visible movements during a 3 minute period20. Mean frequency of movement values were compared 
using Welch’s t-test. Embryos were euthanised at E70. Snout to cloaca length was measured with a tape measure 
and mean values compared by Welch’s t-test. The hindlimbs were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.
Chickens.  Fertilised eggs were incubated at 37 °C with 45% relative humidity. Eggs were ‘windowed’ on E4 using 
standard protocols70,71: briefly, a small section of shell and shell membrane were removed using sterile forceps and 
the shell was resealed with adhesive tape. Chicken embryos were immobilized with decamethonium bromide 
(DMB), which induces rigid paralysis35. Embryos were immobilized between E10–14, 10–18 13–16 and15–18. 
Sterile filtered 5 mg/ml DMB in 100 μ​l Tyrode’s solution was injected through the egg window onto the cho-
rioallantoic membrane to induce immobilization. On each subsequent day, 100 μ​l of 1 mg/ml DMB in TS was 
administered to maintain paralysis. Embryos were monitored by viewing through the egg window on each day of 
treatment and any DMB-treated embryos which were not fully paralysed were excluded from the study. Control 
animals received equivalent volumes of TS. The embryos were euthanized on the final day of treatment, hind-
limbs removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The sex of chicken embryos used for this study was unknown, 
but previous studies indicate that sexual dimorphism in the growth of domestic chickens only occurs postnatally; 
body mass and growth hormone expression do not diverge between males and females until 2–4 weeks post 
hatching72,73.
Ex vivo measurements of limb length from microCT scans. 
Limbs from crocodiles incubated at 28 °C 
or 32 °C (n =​ 3) and chickens treated with DMB or TS between E10–14, 13–16 and 15–18 (n =​ 5 per group) were 
stained with the contrast agent phosphotungstic acid (PTA) by immersing in a solution of 1% PTA 70% etha-
nol for 72 hours, to allow visualisation of cartilage by micro-computed tomography (microCT)74. Limbs were 
scanned with a SkyScan 1172 microCT system (Bruker, Belgium) with a resolution of 5 μ​m, voltage of 40 kv, 
current of 250 μ​A, exposure time of 1600 ms and a 0.5 mm aluminium filter. Images were reconstructed using 
NRecon and whole limb lengths and length of the femur, TBT and TMT elements measured using DataViewer 
software (Bruker, Belgium). Limb measurements from the different chicken and crocodile groups were compared 
using Mann-Whitney U-tests and Welch’s t-tests, respectively.
Noninvasive monitoring of embryonic limb growth in ovo. 
Chicken embryos treated with TS (n =​ 6) 
or DMB (n =​ 4) between E10–18 were imaged daily between E14–18 with a Philips Intera 1.5 T MR system with 
a SENSE flex spinal coil (Philips Medical Systems). The eggs were cooled for 10 minutes at 4 °C prior to imaging 
to temporarily reduce embryo movement in TS treated chicks. The eggs were imaged in the dorsal plane using a 
fast field echo sequence with a flip angle of 60 °C, echo time of 3.41 ms and repetition time of 7.62 ms. Time out of 
the incubator for imaging did not vary between TS and DMB treated groups. The embryos were euthanized after 
the final scan on E18 and staged according to the Hamburger and Hamilton staging series42 to assess the impact 
that removing the eggs from the incubator daily and cooling had on embryonic development; staging was based 
on third digit and beak length, which were measured with digital callipers. The scan images were imported into 
ImageJ75 as image stacks and total limb length and element length were calculated by identifying the most prox-
imal and distal bone points in the image stack76. Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to compare the DMB-treated 
embryo values to controls at each timepoint.
Sectioning and growth plate histology. 
Fixed, dissected limbs from embryonic chicks treated with TS/
DMB between E10–14 and E10–18 were processed to paraffin for embedding and sectioning. 6 μ​m sections were 
stained with Toluidine blue. Sections were imaged using a DM4000B upright microscope and DC500 colour cam-
era, both controlled through Leica Application Suite software version 2.8.1 (all from Leica Microsystems, Milton 
Keynes, UK). The objective used was a 10x HC PL FLUOTAR PH1 (NA =​ 0.3). Growth plate zones (proliferating/
maturing, prehypertrophic and hypertrophic) were identified based on cell morphology and organisation, meas-
ured and expressed as a proportion of the total growth plate width77 using ImageJ. All growth plate zones were 
identified and measured by the same observer, and the growth plate images were temporarily assigned a random 
ID number unrelated to treatment group during analysis to minimise bias. Mean growth plate widths were com-
pared using Welch’s t-test.
Assessment of cellular kinetics in the growth plate. 
We performed immunohistochemistry to detect 
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and phosphohistone H3 using sections from the distal femoral growth

plate of embryonic chicks treated with TS/DMB between E10–14 and −​18 (n =​ 5 per group, full method includ-
ing antibody dilutions in Supplementary Methods). The epiphysis was divided into 4 zones to assess distribution 
of PCNA-labelled cells: the articular cartilage, “resting” zone, proliferating zone and prehyperophic/hypertrophic 
zone. The proportion of PCNA labelled cells to total DAPI labelled cells was calculated in each zone for PCNA, 
and in a representative view of the growth plate for phosphohistone H3. BrdU incorporation by proliferating cells 
was assessed in TS/DMB treated embryos at E16, in embryos euthanised 4 hours after BrdU administration (see 
Supplementary methods). We quantified the number of BrdU-positive cells, expressed as a proportion of total 
DAPI-labelled cells, in the proliferative zone and prehypertrophic/hypertrophic zones using Image J. Sections 
were imaged using a DM4000B upright microscope with samples illuminated using an EBQ100 light source and 
filter cubes A4, L5, and TX2 (all from Leica Microsystems, Milton Keynes, UK) and an AxioCam MRm mon-
ochrome camera controlled through Axiovision software version 4.8.2 (Carl Zeiss Ltd, Cambridge, UK). The 
objectives used were: 5x HC PL FLUOTAR (NA =​ 0.15); 10x HC PL FLUOTAR PH1 (NA =​ 0.3). Mean values 
from control and immobilized limbs were compared using Mann-Whitney U-test.
The size of chondrocytes from the distal femoral hypertrophic zone adjacent to the chondro-osseous junction 
was assessed in freshly killed chicken embryos treated with TS or DMB between E10–14 and E10–18 (n =​ 6 in 
each group). One femur from each chick was removed and bisected sagitally78. The tissue was maintained at 
37 °C in standard culture media until required, then incubated with 5 μ​M calcein AM for 15 minutes at 37 °C to 
fluorescently label viable cells. A representative area from the base of the hypertrophic zone was then collected 
as an image stack in 3D using an SP5 confocal microscope using Leica Application Suite advanced fluorescence 
software version 2.6 (Leica Microsystems, Milton Keynes, UK). The objective used was a 40x HCX PL FLUOTAR 
PH2 (NA =​ 0.75). The average maximum cell area of calcein AM labelled hypertrophic chondrocytes was quanti-
fied from image stacks from representative regions from the hypertrophic zone in control and immobilized chicks 
( >​ 20 cells per growth plate) using ImageJ and compared using Mann-Whitney U-test. Apoptosis was evaluated 
using TUNEL assay (see Supplementary Methods).
RNA extraction and Microarray analysis. 
The hindlimbs were dissected from freshly killed embryos 
treated with either TS or DMB from E10 onwards. The growth cartilage from the distal femur and proximal 
TBT was dissected. Any fully ossified bone, bone marrow and red blood cells were excluded. The tissue was 
snap-frozen by immersing in liquid nitrogen and stored at −​80 °C until required. The tissue was not allowed 
to thaw prior to RNA isolation. The following samples were collected: control femur and TBT RNA from E12, 
control femur and TBT RNA from E13, control femur and TBT RNA from E15, immobilised femur and TBT 
RNA from E15 (n =​ 3 biological replicates in each group. Each biological replicate contained the pooled growth 
cartilage from 4 individual chicken embryos.
Total RNA was isolated using TRizol®​ (Life Technologies). RNA was dissolved in 20 μ​l RNAse-free water. 
Affymetrix DNA microarrays (Chicken) were processed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (BEA Core 
facility, Huddinge Hospital, Sweden). From the twenty four samples processed, 1 sample was excluded as an 
outlier by visually evaluating principal component analysis prior to down-stream analysis. The raw data has been 
deposited at the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession no.: GSE77412). Aroma.affymetrix79 and Bioconductor80 
packages in R were used to preprocess the CEL files and generate summarized expression matrices. A standard 
deviation filter (SD =​ 10) was applied to remove low expressed invariant probe-sets (which reflect background 
signal or poorly functioning probesets) and this value is array type specific (obtained by first plotting the distri-
bution of SD values). For annotation, the Chicken_Gg_ENST, binary.cdf was used. For comparing various groups 
an unpaired SAMR (significance analysis of microarrays) analysis was used to estimate the false discovery rate 
(FDR) using 5,000 permutations. The nearest FDR value to 5% was utilized in the pathway or ontology analysis. 
There are limitations to the usefulness of pathway or gene ontology (GO) analysis for identifying enrichments 
of biological functions among genes in a list of regulated genes81. Thus, to interpret a significant p-value for GO 
analysis as being evidence of specific enrichment, the ‘regulated gene list’ (in this case genes with AEU events) 
must be contrasted with a list of the detectable genes in the experiment (and not all the genes in the genome or on 
the gene-chip). Only when the experimentally regulated list contains enriched p-values well above those observed 
due to bias did we consider the observation reliable. As well as Ingenuity IPA analysis we utilized GOstats package 
in R with current GO categories (GO.db) to confirm the IPA analysis. Input gene lists, and related background 
expression gene lists were used in IPA and GO with an ~5% FDR and no-fold change filter. The latter is used 
because it is well established that a large number of coordinated but modest gene expression changes can mean-
ingfully underlie shifts in pathway regulation.

Environment: Towards a Predictive Theory

Summary
Many species are experiencing sus-
tained environmental change mainly due
to human activities. The unusual rate and
extent of anthropogenic alterations of the
environment may exceed the capacity of
developmental, genetic, and demographic
mechanisms that populations have evolved
to deal with environmental change. To
begin to understand the limits to popula-
tion persistence, we present a simple
evolutionary model for the critical rate of
environmental change beyond which a
population must decline and go extinct.
We use this model to highlight the major
determinants
of
extinction
risk
in
a
changing environment, and identify re-
search needs for improved predictions
based on projected changes in environ-
mental variables. Two key parameters
relating the environment to population
biology have not yet received sufficient
attention. Phenotypic plasticity, the direct
influence of environment on the develop-
ment of individual phenotypes, is increas-
ingly considered an important component
of phenotypic change in the wild and
should be incorporated in models of
population
persistence.
Environmental
sensitivity of selection, the change in the
optimum phenotype with the environ-
ment, still crucially needs empirical assess-
ment. We use environmental tolerance
curves and other examples of ecological
and evolutionary responses to climate
change to illustrate how these mechanistic
approaches can be developed for predic-
tive purposes.
Introduction
Global climate change, over-exploita-
tion, and habitat alteration are causing
sustained and consistent pressures on wild
populations [1]. Because of habitat frag-
mentation, many species will not be able
to track their preferred environment in
space, and must therefore adapt in situ to
avoid extinction. What determines the
maximum rate of environmental change
that populations can cope with? Under-
standing this will inform both models and
management plans about where critical
thresholds lie or what might affect the
potential resilience of particular species or
ecological communities.
Two main approaches exist for studying
the impact of environmental change on
species persistence—niche modelling and
mechanistic population modelling. On the
one hand, ‘‘climate envelope models’’ (or
‘‘niche models’’) are correlative and fo-
cused on the environment. Their concep-
tual background traces to Hutchinson’s
multidimensional representation of the
niche [2]. They use measurements of
environmental variables and records of
species presence and absence to infer
abiotic correlates of the realized niche of
a species. By projecting this niche on a
map with environmental data, the spatial
locations that satisfy the basic require-
ments of the species are identified. Niche
models have been combined with climate
projections to predict range shifts and
extinction
rates
[3].
Aside
from
the
methodological caveats of this approach
(changing covariance of environmental
variables [4], population demography not
in equilibrium with changing climate [5],
spatial scale of the analysis [6,7], and
source-sink dynamics allowing individuals
to exist outside their niche [8]), its major
drawback is that it does not account for
the biological processes underlying adap-
tation of a species to its environment. It
cannot identify or incorporate the biolog-
ical differences among species that deter-
mine whether or not they can persist in
situ. While a new generation of ‘‘process-
based’’ (or ‘‘mechanistic’’) niche models is
being developed to overcome these limi-
tations [9–11], they currently rely on
simplified
demographic
processes
and
generally overlook evolution in response
to climate change (but see [12]). Niche
modelling is thus currently more suited to
understand changes in the distribution of
suitable environments for a species at a
continental scale than to predict popula-
tion persistence or guide conservation
plans.
On the other hand, mechanistic popu-
lation modelling focuses on the biological
processes that underlie population persis-
tence. By combining evolutionary genetics
and
demography,
the
conditions
that
allow a population to maintain a positive
intrinsic
growth
rate
in
the
face
of
environmental change can be predicted
theoretically [13,14] and studied empiri-
cally [15]. The main focus of mechanistic
population studies is not environmental
variables, but ecologically important phe-
notypic traits (morphology, physiology,
phenology, or behaviour) that affect pop-
ulation growth through their influence on
life history. In contrast to niche modelling,
this
approach
allows
identification
of
Essays articulate a specific perspective on a topic of
broad interest to scientists.

factors that potentially limit population
persistence in a changing environment.
However, unless environmental variables
are included, as well as phenotypic traits,
this approach cannot be used to project
the fate of populations.
Here, we propose a model of evolution
and population growth to address how
demographic and evolutionary constraints
limit the persistence of a geographically
isolated population under sustained envi-
ronmental change. This model generaliz-
es an earlier one by Lynch and Lande
[13] by including phenotypic plasticity
(see Box 1–Glossary) and an explicit
environmental variable such as tempera-
ture. We use it to highlight the determi-
nants of extinction risk and to identify
research needs for a more predictive
approach to population persistence in a
changing environment. Research directed
towards key determinants of extinction
risk that are often overlooked in current
empirical work may allow population
biologists to take advantage of abundant
environmental data in order to begin
developing predictions about population
persistence under alternative scenarios of
climate change [16], which can help to
guide conservation policies and manage-
ment plans.
Extinction Risk under Sustained
Environmental Change
There are three mechanisms by which a
population can persist when its local
environment changes: dispersal to track
its preferred environment in space, genetic
evolution to the new local conditions, or
phenotypic plasticity [17,18]. Using the
model in Box 2 and Text S1, we give an
overview of the determinants of extinction
risk for an isolated population with a
restricted geographic range under sus-
tained environmental change, assuming
dispersal is not possible. We consider cases
where all other possible factors influencing
extinction risk (demographic and environ-
mental stochasticity, inbreeding depres-
sion, genetic drift [19]) can be ignored
relative to the impact of sustained envi-
ronmental change. The determinants of
extinction risk then belong to three main
classes.
(1) Demographic properties of the population.
These are components of the population
growth rate that are not affected by
adaptation to the changing environment.
They include the generation time, T, and
the maximum intrinsic rate of increase rmax
(per unit time) of a population with
optimum mean phenotype. Even if these
parameters are not affected by the envi-
ronmental change, they do constrain the
rate of adaptation. Populations with longer
generations must evolve faster per gener-
ation to adapt to a given rate of environ-
mental change, and populations with a
low rmax will reach extinction before they
can adapt to rapid environmental change
[13–15,20]. The specific influence of each
of these variables on extinction risk across
taxa also depends on their covariation.
Broad-scale studies of life-history traits
indicate that the per-generation intrinsic
rate of increase is of the same order of
magnitude across several taxa, whereas
rmax per unit time is roughly inversely
proportional
to
the
generation
time
[21–23]. As a consequence, the critical
rate of environmental change should be
generally lower for species with longer
generation times, which will be at greater
extinction risk.
(2) Evolutionary potential. This measures
how fast genetic evolution occurs for a
given deviation of the mean phenotype
from
the
optimum.
The
strength
of
stabilizing selection c measures how the
mean fitness decreases with the squared
deviation from the optimum and also
determines the strength of directional
selection for a given deviation from the
optimum. Stronger stabilizing selection
(larger
c),
although
causing
increased
mortality,
allows
faster
environmental
change to be tolerated by causing faster
evolution [13]. The genetic variance, the
product of phenotypic variance s2 and
heritability
h2,
determines
how
much
genetic evolution is caused by a given
strength of selection. Higher genetic var-
iance allows persistence under stronger
environmental change, because it allows
the population to track its phenotypic
optimum more closely. Although we focus
on a single trait for simplicity, this may
actually
be
a
linear
combination
of
measurable traits. In this case, the genetic
variances of the original traits and their
genetic covariances affect the magnitude

of the genetic response to selection in any
phenotypic direction [24,25].
(3) Biological impact of the environment. This
links the environment to the biology of
individuals
in
the
species.
Phenotypic
plasticity describes the direct impact of
the environment on the development of
individual phenotypes. It may involve
morphological, physiological or behav-
ioural responses, which can occur on
different
time
scales.
For
continuous
environmental variables, plasticity usually
is modelled using reaction norms, where
the phenotype of a given genotype is
plotted as a function of the environment
[26]. We focus on linear reaction norms
for simplicity, although reaction norms
can be non-linear [27,28] (see below).
With linear reaction norms, the slope b
quantifies the degree of plasticity. The
environmental sensitivity of selection, B,
measures how the optimum phenotype
changes with the environment, which for
simplicity we also assume is a linear
relationship. With no cost of plasticity,
populations with b closer to B are likely to
persist under higher rates of environmen-
tal change.
A Research Program
This model can be combined with
environmental projections to ask whether
future rates of environmental change will
threaten
the
persistence
of
particular
populations or species. Application of the
model
requires
multiple
steps,
which
previously have been undertaken in isola-
tion or in combination, although all have
rarely been completed together.
Identify Ecologically Important Traits
Affecting Population Growth
Ecological investigation in the field is
needed to identify traits that potentially
determine adaptation to a specific envi-
ronment. For instance, for ectotherms
such
as
insects
and
reptiles,
thermal
adaptation may occur not only through
physiological traits governing energy me-
tabolism, but also through behavioural
and
morphological
traits
involved
in
movement between shaded and sunny
patches [29]. For many bird species,
adaptation to global warming involves
adjusting their breeding date so that
reproduction coincides with a peak in
prey density [30].
The strength (and direction) of natural
selection c has been estimated in many
plant and animal taxa by regressing the
fitness of individuals on their phenotypes
[31,32]. Most of these studies focus on
relative fitness, which determines the evo-
lutionary dynamics. However, absolute
fitness and rmax are needed to understand
how phenotypic traits influence population
dynamics. Analysis of natural selection has
been extended to age- or stage-structured
populations, allowing identification of parts
of the life cycle where phenotypes most
strongly influence demography [33–36].
Box 2. A Model of Phenotypic Evolution and Persistence under
Sustained Environmental Change
We assume that a continuous environmental parameter e (e.g., temperature or
precipitation) changes at a constant rate g in time. Adaptation to this changing
environment is mediated by a quantitative trait z that determines fitness. Selection
on multiple correlated traits also can be incorporated [20], but for simplicity we focus
on single trait. Population growth is assumed to be density-independent, which can
be a good approximation even with density dependence, if the population remains
well below the carrying capacity because of maladaptation. In contrast to the original
model and its recent extensions [13,20], we include phenotypic plasticity in the trait z,
such that a given change in the environment directly modifies the phenotype of each
individual by a constant amount. The rate of environmental change is expressed per
unit time (e.g., uC per year) instead of per generation.
Under
sustained
environmental
change,
assuming
constant
genetic
and
phenotypic variance and strength of stabilizing selection, the rate of phenotypic
evolution eventually reaches a steady state where the mean phenotype lags a
constant distance behind the changing optimum phenotype (Text S1). If this
distance is such that the population has a negative growth rate, extinction occurs.
The maximum rate of environmental change that allows long-term persistence of
the population (or critical rate of environmental change) is

The original model [13] revealed how the phenotypic variance s2 and heritability
h2 of the trait, the strength of stabilizing selection c, and the maximum intrinsic
rate of population growth rmax determined the critical rate of environmental
change in the absence of phenotypic plasticity.
Three other parameters included here emphasize important factors affecting
persistence
when
the
directional
environmental
change
is
expressed
in
environmental units per unit time. First is the generation time T. The remaining
two parameters are the environmental sensitivity of selection B, which measures
how changes in the environment influence the optimum phenotype, and
phenotypic plasticity b, which quantifies the direct impact of the environment on
development of individual phenotypes. The critical rate of environmental change
for long-term persistence increases with decreasing absolute difference between
the environmental sensitivity of selection and phenotypic plasticity. Although
plasticity causes weaker natural selection on the trait and smaller genetic
response to selection, this is more than compensated by the plastic phenotypic
change that brings the mean phenotype closer to the optimum (Text S1).
Plasticity may also entail a fitness cost [59]. The cost of plasticity decreases rmax,
which can then be formulated as

b quantifies the magnitude of the cost for a
given plasticity b. By decreasing rmax, the cost of plasticity decreases the critical
rate of environmental change, thus opposing the beneficial effect of plasticity on
gc. The overall effect of phenotypic plasticity on the critical rate of environmental
change is shown in Figure 2 for several values of the cost of plasticity. When the
cost of plasticity is above a threshold (v2
bvv2
lim), there is an intermediate value of
plasticity that maximizes the critical rate of environmental change.

Estimate Genetic Variance and
Plasticity
The question of whether genetic varia-
tion (h2s2) along the direction of natural
selection limits the rate of evolution has
motivated many studies. For instance, in
the North American prairie plant Chamae-
crista fasciculate, small genetic variance for a
linear combination of traits has been
predicted to limit the response to selection
caused by climate change [25]. Similarly,
it was suggested that lack of genetic
variation for desiccation and cold resis-
tance restricts the geographic range of
several Drosophila species [37] and would
limit the response to projected climate
change in one of them [38]. Changes in
the genetic and phenotypic variation with
the environment may also be important.
For example, the response to selection on
body weight in wild Soay sheep is reduced
because of lower heritability in environ-
ments where selection is stronger [39].
The importance of phenotypic plasticity
for rapid evolution in response to direc-
tional environmental change has only
recently been fully appreciated. Many
authors have observed adaptive phenotyp-
ic evolution without being able to firmly
attribute it to genetic change (reviewed in
[40]), but relatively
few studies have
progressed from considering plasticity as
a nuisance parameter to measuring norms
of reaction, and their slopes b, in the
context of climate change [41]. This was
done recently for reproductive timing in
mammals [42] and birds [43,44].
Measure the Environmental
Sensitivity of Selection
Few investigators have measured the
environmental sensitivity of phenotypic
selection as described by parameter B in
Box 2. The most relevant studies have
measured selection in a small number of
discrete environments. This approach has
been applied to birds to describe the
influence of changing seasonality on selec-
tion on breeding date [45], and in plants
to examine the impact of drought on
selection on physiological traits [46,47]. It
has also been combined with experimental
manipulation of the environment, mainly
in plants, using either abiotic [48] or biotic
factors,
such
as
crowding
[49,50]
or
natural enemies [51,52]. Other studies
have employed ecological criteria to iden-
tify changes in the optimum phenotype
without actually measuring selection. For
instance, the optimum egg-laying date for
birds can be deduced from the temporal
peak in food availability determined by the
population dynamics of insects on which
they feed [53].
What emerges from this brief outline is
that two key areas of study are lacking: the
quantification of the environmental sensi-
tivity of selection across continuous envi-
ronments and the detailed investigation of
phenotypic plasticity, including its costs
and limits under sustained environmental
change.
Further
work,
such
as
that
outlined below, would begin to make
predictive approaches possible.
Phenotypic Selection along an
Environmental Gradient
A relationship between an environmen-
tal variable and a measure of selection,
either observed in the wild or derived from
an experiment, has been argued to be the
strongest evidence for the cause of natural
selection [54]. Quantification of this rela-
tionship is required to predict population
evolution and persistence in a changing
environment. Most of the studies high-
lighted above compared selective pressures
among discrete environmental states, often
interpreted
as
stresses
(but
see
[39]).

Current global change, however, mainly
involves continuous environmental vari-
ables for which precise time series and
projections are available. The environ-
mental
sensitivity
of
selection
should
therefore
be
estimated
by
measuring
phenotypic selection along a continuous
environmental gradient. Apart from mea-
suring a fundamental parameter of the
model, this would also allow its basic
assumptions to be tested. In particular, our
model (like previous ones) assumes that
environmental change primarily alters the
optimum phenotype with little impact on
the width of the fitness function (Figure 1),
but this assumption has hardly ever been
tested empirically.
Measurement of selection in several
environments may be difficult to carry
out in the field because of lack of con-
trol over environmental parameters. For
some species such measurements could be
performed in controlled laboratory con-
ditions, provided the relationship between
fitness in the laboratory and in the wild
can be established. Alternatively, perfor-
mance can be measured in the laboratory
and
the
relationship
between
perfor-
mance and fitness assessed in the wild
[55].
Studies of thermal tolerance curves in
ectotherms commonly measure fitness in
continuous environments. However, these
studies generally relate fitness (or perfor-
mance)
directly
to
the
environment,
which
makes
it
difficult
to
produce
evolutionary predictions and to test them
experimentally [56]. Modelling tolerance
curves with an underlying phenotypic
trait subject to natural selection and
phenotypic plasticity may prove more
fruitful, since it should allow predictions
about the dynamics of tolerance curve
evolution (Box 3).
Costs and Limits of Plasticity in
a Changing Environment
Plasticity in Extreme Environments
The model in Box 2 assumes a linear
reaction norm, implying that a given
amount of environmental change always
produces
the same plastic phenotypic
change. Plasticity is generally studied in
the context of environments that vary in
space or fluctuate in time with a stationary
distribution, but little is known about
plastic responses outside the usual range
of variation. Extreme environments may
disrupt the plastic response, such that the
reaction norm may take any shape in
environments that were rarely encoun-
tered before [57]. This argument is based
on the theory of the evolution of reaction
norm
in
heterogeneous
environments,
assuming little genetic constraint on reac-
tion norm shape. However, reaction norm
shapes are likely to be genetically con-
strained. For many traits, plastic pheno-
typic responses should reach a physiolog-
ical
limit
and
‘‘saturate’’
in
extreme
environments [58]. For instance, body size
or metabolic rate obviously cannot in-
crease
or
decrease
indefinitely
under
sustained environmental change. For oth-
er traits, disruption of homeostasis may
cause the plastic response to be amplified
in extreme environments. Both of these
mechanisms could generate skewed toler-
ance curves like those observed for re-
sponse to temperature, even when pheno-
typic selection is symmetric (Box 3).
Costs of Plasticity and the Generalist
versus Specialist Trade-Off
Phenotypic plasticity may entail several
types of fitness costs to the organism
independent of the expressed phenotype
[59]. Here, we shall only distinguish two
kinds of costs of plasticity: constitutive and
induced. A constitutive cost reduces indi-
vidual
fitness depending only on the
degree of plasticity. This includes the cost
of maintaining physiological machinery
that allows phenotypic plasticity or acquir-
ing information about the environment
[59]. The model in Box 2 focuses on such
costs. In contrast an induced cost is a
reduction in fitness that depends on the
amount of plastic phenotypic change. This
kind of cost is physiological and can be
Box 3. Tolerance Curves and Phenotypic Plasticity
Environmental tolerance curves relating fitness (or performance) to abiotic
environmental variables such as temperature [56] or salinity [77] have been
studied for a wide variety of organisms, ranging from reptiles and amphibians to
insects and plants [56]. They are generally characterized by a few descriptive
variables, such as critical environments (where fitness or performance vanishes),
optimum environment (where fitness is maximized), and skewness. Previous
models investigated the benefits of broad versus narrow tolerance curves under
several forms of environmental change [61,62,78], but they failed to produce
predictions about the dynamics of and constrains on tolerance curve evolution.
Recently there have been calls for new theoretical developments with clearer
empirically testable outcomes [56].
We propose that incorporating phenotypically plastic traits, which are under
stabilizing selection through their influence on lifetime fitness [33,34,79], can
clarify how tolerance curves emerge and evolve (Figure 1). With linear reaction
norms and constant strength of stabilizing selection across environments (ridge
with constant width in the adaptive landscape), the reaction norm slope
determines tolerance breadth, while the reaction norm intercept (or elevation)
determines the optimum environment (first column in Figure 1). With genetic
variation in the slope of reaction norms, the tolerance breadth may evolve as a
consequence of evolving phenotypic plasticity in the underlying trait. Including a
cost of plasticity, where fitness decreases with reaction norm slope regardless of
the trait value [80,81], produces a generalist–specialist trade-off between
tolerance breadth and maximum fitness, corresponding to the intuitive idea that
a ‘‘Jack-of-all-trades is a master of none.’’ This is illustrated in the bottom left
panel of Figure 1—with cost an increasing function of plasticity (dashed lines), the
red dashed tolerance curve has a lower maximum fitness than the green dashed
curve, because the former reaction norm has greater plasticity. This approach can
be used to make testable predictions in specific cases based on measures of the
variability, inheritance, and plasticity of phenotypic traits.
Thermal tolerance curves generally are strongly skewed, with fitness decreasing
steeply as temperature approaches the critical thermal maximum [56]. This could
be caused by non-linear reaction norms for underlying traits, as illustrated by the
second column in Figure 1. Plastic phenotypic responses that saturate (yellow
genotype) or increase exponentially (green genotype) in extreme environments
could both induce skewed tolerance curves. Alternatively, skewed tolerance
curves could be caused by the strength of stabilizing selection (width of the
fitness ridge) changing with the environment (third column in Figure 1). Finally,
the fitness function acting on the trait may itself be skewed in all environments,
the height of the fitness ridge may depend on the environment, or the optimum
phenotype may change non-linearly with the environment (not shown). These
five possible causes of skewness have different implications for the evolution of
thermal tolerance in a changing environment, and need to be tested empirically.

understood in terms of constraints on
energy allocation. It applies mainly to
labile traits that may change repeatedly
during the lifetime of an individual, such
as breeding date for birds [60].
In the literature on tolerance curves, the
cost of plasticity is generally expressed as a
trade-off between tolerance breadth and
fitness
in
the
optimum
environment,
corresponding to the intuitive idea that
the
‘‘Jack-of-all-trades
is
a
master
of
none.’’ This has been modelled [61,62],
but the empirical evidence is still contro-
versial
[56,63]
and
based
mainly
on
comparative data among taxa rather than
on within-species variation (but see [64]).
We propose that this trade-off may be a
consequence of the cost of plasticity for an
underlying
phenotypic
trait
(Box
3,
Figure 1).
In the model of Box 2 and Figure 2, we
show how a constitutive cost of plasticity
can limit the critical rate of environmental
change for population persistence. An
induced cost would yield a similar result
in
this
model
since
the
environment
changes at a constant rate. The cost of
plasticity may thus limit population per-
sistence in a changing environment, yet
little is known about its importance in
natural
populations.
A
recent
review
showed that such costs may be widespread
but weak [65]. Further research is needed
to measure costs of plasticity for organisms
with
long
generations
(such
as
large
mammals and trees) or with life cycles
that depend on seasonal timing (e.g.,
interaction of temperature and photoperi-
od [66]), which rely most on plasticity to
persist in a rapidly changing environment.
Limitations of the Model
Our
model
includes
a
number
of
simplifying assumptions. We assume a
constant shape of the fitness function
across environments, allowing only the
optimum phenotype to change with the
environment. However, the strength of
stabilizing selection around the optimum
phenotype c may depend on the environ-
ment (Figure 1, third column, second row).
Furthermore the maximum fitness rmax
may generally be lower in more extreme
environments
because
of
physiological
constraints,
such
that
the
ridge
in
Figure 1 would have an intermediate
maximum. This was shown to occur in a
recent
comparative
study
of
thermal
tolerance curves among several insect
taxa, where the maximum fitness was
lower for species that had their optimum
at
a
lower
temperature
[67].
Other
demographic parameters including the
generation time T may change with the
environment. Genotype 6 environment
interaction (or genetic variance in plastic-
ity) can cause the genetic variance (h2s2) to
depend
on
the
environment
[68–71].
Although these mechanisms are not in-
cluded in our simple model, they all can be
analyzed theoretically and studied empir-
ically, and should be included where they
are suspected to be important.
Plasticity itself may evolve if it varies
genetically, and new environments can
cause directional selection on plasticity
[72,73]. However, more information is
needed about plasticity and its inheritance
in extreme environments before the evo-
lution of plasticity can be included in the
analysis of persistence under sustained
environmental change.
Finally, we considered a population that
cannot disperse nor receive migrants from
other populations experiencing different
environments. We focused on this situa-
tion
because
it
is
one
that
is
most
commonly overlooked in niche modelling
studies. Our model thus applies best to
species with habitats restricted by dispersal
barriers or species which disperse slowly
relative to the rate of environmental
change [74]. At the other extreme, a
population may be able to persist by
following its preferred environment in
space without any evolution, as assumed
in niche modelling, but this is very unlikely
for species occupying fragmented habitats.
For populations that can both disperse and
evolve in response to a changing environ-
ment, gene flow among populations with
different environments may limit local
adaptation and restrict the geographic
range of the population or even cause
extinction [74,75].
Conclusion
Our aim was to describe an approach
based on evolutionary and demographic
mechanisms that can be used to make
predictions on population persistence in a
changing environment and to highlight
the most important variables to measure.
While this approach is obviously more
costly and time-consuming than niche
modelling, its results are also likely to be
more useful for specific purposes because it
explicitly incorporates the factors that limit
population
response
to
environmental
change.
The feasibility of such a mechanistic
approach has been demonstrated by a few
recent studies. Deutsch et al. [76] used
thermal tolerance curves to predict the
fitness consequence of climate change for
many species of terrestrial insects across
latitudes, but without explicitly consider-
ing phenotypic plasticity or genetic evolu-
tion.

Egg
desiccation was treated as a threshold
trait, but the possibility of phenotypic
plasticity or evolution of the threshold
was not considered. These encouraging
efforts call for more empirical studies
where genetic evolution and phenotypic
plasticity are combined with demography
to make predictions about population
persistence in a changing environment.
The simple approach we have outlined is a
necessary step towards a more specific and
comprehensive understanding of the influ-
ence of environmental change on popula-
tion extinction.

Despite the abundance of research reporting the neurophysiological and behavioral effects
of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in healthy young adults and clinical
populations, the extent of potential neuroplastic changes induced by tDCS in healthy older
adults is not well understood. The present study compared the extent and time course
of anodal tDCS-induced plastic changes in primary motor cortex (M1) in young and older
adults. Furthermore, as it has been suggested that neuroplasticity and associated learning
depends on the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene polymorphisms, we also
assessed the impact of BDNF polymorphism on these effects. Corticospinal excitability
was examined using transcranial magnetic stimulation before and following (0, 10, 20,
30 min) anodal tDCS (30 min, 1 mA) or sham in young and older adults. While the overall
extent of increases in corticospinal excitability induced by anodal tDCS did not vary reliably
between young and older adults, older adults exhibited a delayed response; the largest
increase in corticospinal excitability occurred 30 min following stimulation for older adults,
but immediately post-stimulation for the young group. BDNF genotype did not result in
signiﬁcant differences in the observed excitability increases for either age group. The
present study suggests that tDCS-induced plastic changes are delayed as a result of healthy
aging, but that the overall efﬁcacy of the plasticity mechanism remains unaffected.

INTRODUCTION
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive
brain stimulation (NIBS) technique that induces transmem-
brane neuronal potential and thus inﬂuences the level of cortical
excitability (see review Nitsche et al., 2008; Zaghi et al., 2010). It is
thought that the neuronal changes associated with the persisting
effects of tDCS are analogous to activity-dependent synaptic plas-
ticity, i.e., long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression
(LTD; Di Lazzaro et al., 2012). There are a number of lines of
evidence for the induction of LTP by DC stimulation. Fritsch
et al. (2010) showed that the synaptic effects of direct current
stimulation which induced LTP in mouse motor cortex (M1)
slices is dependent on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
activation. Ranieri et al. (2012) further demonstrated that DC
stimulation applied to rat brain slices modulated LTP in a polar-
ity speciﬁc manner, i.e., modulation of LTP was increased by
anodal and reduced by cathodal DC stimulation. Pharmacolog-
ical studies have also shown that tDCS after-effects are affected
by NMDA receptor antagonist dextromethorphane (Nitsche et al.,
2003a; Ranieri et al., 2012). These results strongly indicate that the
effects induced by tDCS share similarities with activity-dependent
synaptic plasticity, such as LTP and LTD (Di Lazzaro et al., 2012).
Furthermore, DC stimulation also modulates LTP induced by
other NIBS techniques and interferes with learning and mem-
ory processes which are strongly associated with LTP (Kim and
Linden, 2007). Thus tDCS is considered to have capacity to induce
LTP/LTD-like plasticity.
The application of tDCS over M1 elicits changes in corti-
cospinal excitability in a polarity speciﬁc manner: motor evoked
potentials (MEPs) evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS) are potentiated by anodal tDCS and suppressed by catho-
dal tDCS (Nitsche and Paulus, 2000). Furthermore, the technique
is extremely well tolerated by most individuals and allows an easily
applied sham condition to which the participant is readily blinded.
Finally, it has been shown that tDCS can be combined with motor
and cognitive tasks to facilitate learning.
Despite the abundance of research on the behavioral effects
of tDCS on motor function (see review Reis and Fritsch, 2011)
showing increased levels of performance in both healthy (Nitsche
et al., 2003b; Antal et al., 2004; Vines et al., 2006) and clini-
cal populations, such as stroke patients (Hummel et al., 2005;
Kim et al., 2009), only a limited number of studies have inves-
tigated the effects of tDCS over M1 in healthy older adults
(Hummel et al., 2010; Zimerman et al., 2013). These two studies
did not, however, assess the tDCS-induced changes in corti-
cospinal excitability. While the behavioral improvements suggest
that the plastic changes within M1 induced by tDCS were sub-
stantial enough to elicit behavioral change, it is unknown whether
these neural changes varied relative to the changes expected in
young adults. Indeed, there is some evidence that older individuals

may have reduced neuroplasticity (Fathi et al., 2010), at least when
assessed by the paired-associative stimulation (PAS) technique.
The overall conclusion that can be drawn is that there is no con-
sensus on the degree to which neuroplasticity is affected by healthy
aging (Oliviero, 2010).
Recently, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) a neu-
rotrophin within the secretory protein family, has been suggested
to play a crucial role in neuroplasticity and associated learning
(Pascual-Leone et al., 2011). The most common forms of BDNF
polymorphism are Val66Met and Val66Val (Lu, 2003). These
BDNF polymorphisms have been shown to differentially mod-
ulate human cortical plasticity as a response to training (Kleim
et al., 2006), brain stimulation (Cheeran et al., 2008), and motor
learning (Fritsch et al., 2010). Thus, the BDNF example suggests
that individuals with a certain genetic predisposition may show a
different response to interventions that modulate brain plasticity –
either in a use-dependent manner (i.e., motor or cognitive train-
ing) or induced via NIBS techniques. The relationship between
tDCS induced aftereffects and BDNF genotype, however, is still
unclear.
Given the current uncertainty as to the effects of aging on neu-
roplasticity in M1 and its interaction with BDNF genotype, the
present study investigated, for the ﬁrst time, age-related changes
in the degree of plasticity following anodal tDCS (facilitatory)
and the inﬂuence of BDNF gene polymorphisms on neuroplastic-
ity in the aging brain. Recently, large inter-individual variability
in response to NIBS techniques has been recognized (Müller-
Dahlhaus et al., 2008; Datta et al., 2012; Hamada et al., 2012;
López-Alonso et al., 2014; Wiethoff et al., 2014). Of further inter-
est in the present study, therefore, was to determine whether the
responsiveness to anodal tDCS is affected by age and explore
whether this inter-individual variation is associated with BDNF
genotype.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
PARTICIPANTS
Forty healthy volunteers, consisting of 20 older adults recruited
from the local community (7 males, 13 females, age M = 68.3,
SD = 7.9 years) and 20 young adults recruited from stu-
dents at the University of Tasmania (10 males, 10 females, age
M = 22.7, SD = 3.3 years), participated in the study. Within
the older group, participants had similar socio-economic sta-
tus and were involved in active social activities and/or paid
employment. All participants completed at least high school
education. The Mini-Mental State Examination (Dick et al.,
1984) was used to screen for cognitive deﬁcits in the sam-
ple of older adults. All participants scored within the normal
range (score ≥26) and were free of any neurological, symp-
tomatic cardiovascular disease, diabetes or hypertension. Ethics
approval for the study was obtained from the Human Research
Ethics (Tasmania) Network and written informed consent was
obtained prior to participation in the study. All participants
were screened for contra-indications to TMS. We also consid-
ered the effect of physical activity on the response to tDCS.
Participants completed the International Physical Activity Ques-
tionnaire (IPAQ) which assesses the amount of time during
the previous seven days spent engaging in a range of physical
activities. The IPAQ has been shown to produce reliable and
repeatable measures of physical activities in young (Craig et al.,
2003; Hagstromer et al., 2006) and older adults (Tomioka et al.,
2011).
BDNF GENOTYPING
Three young and one older participant did not feel com-
fortable undergoing the characterization of the genotype.
The remaining 36 participants gave written informed con-
sent prior to participation in the DNA sampling. ARMS-PCR
(Sheikh et al., 2010) was performed to amplify the BDNF gene
region containing rs6265.
Using the four primers P1 for-
ward CCTACAGTTCCACCAGGTGAGAAGAGTG, P2 (reverse)
TCATGGACATGTTTGCAGCATCTAGGTA, P3 (G allele speciﬁc)
CTGGTCCTCATCCAACAGCTCTTCTATAAC and P4 (A allele
speciﬁc) ATCATTGGCTGACACTTTCGAACCCA we could dis-
tinguish two allele speciﬁc amplicons 253 bp (val) and/or 201 bp
(met) along with the 401 bp amplicon (entire rs6265 region
as internal control). The ARMS-PCR reaction was carried out
in a total volume of 12 μl containing 1× REDExtract-N-
AmpTM PCR ReadyMixTM (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 1 μM of
each of the four primers (P1, P2, P3, and P4) and 10 ng
of genomic DNA. Thermocycling conditions were:
denatu-
ration at 94◦C for 3 min,
30 cycles of 95◦C for 45 s,
62◦C for 60 s and 72◦C for 60 s,
with a ﬁnal exten-
sion at 72◦C for 2 min.
ARMS-PCR products were then
resolved on a 4% agarose gel. The samples could then be
classiﬁed as Val/Val (253/253 bp), Val/Met (253/201 bp), or
Met/Met (201/201 bp) based on the observed banding pat-
tern.
All samples should have the rs6265 internal control
(401 bp) band present. Every sample was genotyped from at
least two independent PCR reactions to ensure ﬁdelity. Par-
ticipants were divided into two groups according to their
genotype, either (i) homozygous for the val allele (Val/Val)
or (ii) homozygous and heterozygous for the Met allele
(Met/Met, Val/Met), respectively. Participants and examiner were
blinded with respect to the genotype at the time of examina-
tion.
TMS PROCEDURE AND EMG RECORDING
TMS was used to compare corticospinal excitability of projections
from the cortical representation of the right forearm ﬂexor, ﬂexor
carpi radialis (FCR),within the left M1, before (baseline), immedi-
ately after and at 10, 20, and 30 min intervals following tDCS (see
Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation section below). Single-
pulse TMS was applied using a standard ﬁgure of eight coil (7 cm
diameter of each wing) connected to a Magstim 200 (Magstim
Company, Dyfed, UK). The TMS coil was held tangentially over
the scalp to induce a posterior–anterior current ﬂow and to opti-
mally elicit MEPs in the right FCR. We chose a forearm ﬂexor
muscle rather than an intrinsic hand muscle, as proximal muscles
of the upper limb are often the targets of rehabilitation (Carson
et al., 2013). EMG surface electrodes (Ag/AgCl) were placed over
the right FCR in a belly tendon montage and signals were ampliﬁed
with a gain of 1000, band pass ﬁltered (10–500 Hz) and sampled
at 2000 Hz using a 16-bit AD system (CED 1902, Cambridge, UK).
EMG data were fed to disk for ofﬂine analysis. At the beginning

of each session each individual’s resting motor threshold (rMT)
was determined as the lowest intensity that evoked MEPs of greater
than 50 μV in at least three out of ﬁve consecutive trials for the FCR
(e.g., Carroll et al.,2008). The optimal scalp position for induction
of MEPs in the right FCR was marked on the participant’s head
using a felt tip pen. With both upper limbs relaxed and resting on
a pillow in the participant’s lap, baseline MEP recruitment curves
were constructed by applying stimuli in steps of 10% between 90%
and 160% of rMT. At each intensity, six pulses were delivered with
an inter-stimulus interval of 5 s (Carson et al., 2013); thus each
recruitment curve took approximately 4 min to collect. For thirty
participants, the order of stimulus intensities was randomized;
however, due to a technical problem, for the 10 participants (ﬁve
males), the randomization of intensities was replaced with coun-
terbalanced intensity steps. As no differences between recruitment
curves obtained in a ramping (systematically increased stimu-
lus intensity) and random manner have been observed (Pearce
et al., 2013), it is unlikely that the changes to recruitment curve
acquisition inﬂuenced the results obtained.
TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION (tDCS)
The direct current was generated by a battery-driven constant-
direct current stimulator (Magstim Company, Dyfed, UK).
The current was delivered to the participant through anodal
(5 cm × 5 cm) and cathodal (6 cm × 8.5 cm) conductive rub-
ber electrodes that were placed inside pre-saline soaked and gelled
sponges with conductive gel. Following the baseline measure-
ment, either anodal stimulation or sham stimulation was applied.
The anodal stimulation involved an initial two-second “ramp-
up” period during which the current was brought from 0 to
1 mA. The current then remained at 1 mA for 30 min (Lin-
denberg et al., 2013). The sham stimulation involved the same
initial ramp. However, the current was then immediately ramped
down to zero over a 30 s period (Nitsche et al., 2008). The
participants were blinded to tDCS conditions and were instructed
in both sessions that they may feel a mild itching sensation
under the electrodes. That is, the participants were led to believe
they were receiving tDCS in both sessions (Kessler et al., 2012).
For both anodal tDCS and sham conditions the center of the
anodal electrode was placed over the FCR representation in the
left primary motor cortex, the location of which was identiﬁed
in the initial setup phase of the experiment, while the catho-
dal electrode was positioned over the contralateral supraorbital
region.
PROCEDURE
Participants received sham and anodal tDCS in two separate ses-
sions, one week apart at a similar time of day. The order of sham
and anodal tDCS was counterbalanced across participants. Dur-
ing each session the participants were comfortably seated in a chair
with their left arm supported and stabilized on a pillow with the
elbow in a semi-ﬂexed position to ensure no muscle activations
in the forearm and hand muscles. After establishing the rMT, the
baseline MEP recruitment curve was recorded. This was followed
by 30 min of either sham or anodal tDCS. MEP recruitment curves
were then obtained immediately (0 min), 10, 20, and 30 min after
cessation of tDCS (Figure 1).
DATA PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS
In presenting the results,
the data are expressed as mean
(M) ± 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI). Using spearman’s bivariate
correlations we investigated whether IPAQ score was linearly cor-
related with normalized area under the recruitment curve (AURC)
values. We also considered gender in responses to tDCS, given
that there is evidence that PAS-induced neuroplasticity may be
reduced in older females (Tecchio et al., 2008). Resting motor
thresholds were examined by a 2(AGE: Young, Older) × 2(SEX:
male, female) × 2(GENOTYPE:Val66Val, met-carrier) × 2(STIM:
anodal tDCS, Sham) repeated measures ANOVA.

subsequently averaged across all trials at each stimulation intensity
at each time point (pre, post 0, post 10, post 20, post 30) and for
each participant. Trials in which root mean square (RMS) EMG
exceeded 10 μV (Carson et al.,2004) during the 40 ms immediately
preceding the TMS pulse were discarded. The mean MEP ampli-
tude at each intensity and time point was then used to calculate
the AURC for each time point. The curve was bounded by TMS
intensity using the trapezoidal rule (Potteiger et al., 2002; Carson
et al., 2013). More speciﬁcally, the following formula was used,

stimulus intensities, e.g., 90% rMT and 100% rMT. AURC for each
post-stimulation time point was then normalized for each partici-
pant to AURC obtained at the baseline pre stimulation (anodal or
sham) for that participant.
A mixed factorial ANOVA was undertaken to assess post-
stimulation normalized AURC (dependent variable) using AGE
(Young, Older), SEX (Male, Female), GENOTYPE (Val66Val, met-
carrier), STIM (anodal tDCS, Sham), and TIME (post 0, post
10, post 20, post 30) as independent variables. If the sphericity
assumption was violated, Greenhouse-Geisser’s degrees of free-
dom adjustment was applied. Planned contrasts between groups
(AGE, SEX, and GENOTYPE) at each time point and across
time points for each group separately were conducted to explore
signiﬁcant main and interaction effects.
We performed chi-square tests to evaluate the percentage of
responders and non-responders in two groups divided on the basis
of BDNF, age, or sex. Non-responders were deﬁned operationally
according to the ratio between pre and grand average of the post-
anodal tDCS AURC values across time points (post 0, 10, 20,
and 30) below 1 (Hamada et al., 2012). We chose this criterion to
accept any increases in AURC as a possible neuroplastic response
to anodal tDCS.
The critical p-value was set at 0.05. Cohen’s d, Cramer’s V and
partial eta squared (η2
p) values are provided as measure of effect
size, where appropriate. Cut-offs ≥0.1 small, ≥0.3 medium, ≥0.5
large were applied for Cramer’s V, ≥0.2 small, ≥0.5 medium, ≥0.8
large were applied for Cohen’s d and ≥0.01 small, ≥0.06 medium,
and ≥0.14 large were applied for η2
p (Sink and Stroh, 2006).
RESULTS
Due to a technical error resulting in MEPs not being recorded,
data from one young participant was excluded from all analyses.
Table 1 summarizes demographic information, BDNF geno-
type, and motor thresholds in each session. The BDNF genotype
analysis for the remaining 35 participants for whom we had
genetic data revealed that 24 were homozygous for the Val allele
(Val66Val), while 11 were Met-carriers including seven Val66Met
heterozygotes and four homozygous for the Met allele.
RESTING MOTOR THRESHOLD
Resting motor threshold (deﬁned as a percentage of maxi-
mum stimulator output) was signiﬁcantly higher in Met car-
riers (51.27 ± 3.25%) than Val66Val group (46.48 ± 2.01%),

THE EFFECT OF AGE AND GENOTYPE ON PLASTICITY INDUCED BY
ANODAL tDCS
Repeated measures ANOVA for normalized AURC data revealed
that there was a main effect of STIM, F1,30 = 4.97, p = 0.03,
η2
p = 0.12, indicating, as expected, that the increase in AURC
induced by anodal tDCS (1.34 ± 0.16; +34%, signiﬁcant increase,
p < 0.001, d = 0.70) was signiﬁcantly larger than AURC changes
following sham tDCS (1.14 ± 0.16). The main effect of AGE
was not signiﬁcant, F1,30 = 0.11, p = 0.74, η2
p = 0.002, indi-
cating that overall the magnitude of changes in post-tDCS AURC
values were not statistically different between young and older
adults. However, young and older adults showed different pat-
terns in the modulation of AURC post-tDCS as indicated by a
signiﬁcant interaction of AGE x TIME, F3,90 = 4.68, p = 0.004,
η2
p = 0.11, which is best interpreted with reference to the signiﬁ-
cant three-way interaction of AGE x STIM x TIME, F3,90 = 2.84,
p = 0.04, η2
p = 0.07. For young adults, although within the
anodal condition AURC values were not signiﬁcantly differ-
ent between the different time points (ps > 0.17, ds < 0.32),
AURC values at only post 0 and post 10 following tDCS were
signiﬁcantly higher than respective time points in the sham
condition (ps < 0.008, ds > 0.41). A different response pat-
tern was observed in older adults with AURC values at post
20 (1.40 ± 0.33) and post 30 (1.53 ± 0.35) being signiﬁcantly
higher than post 0 (1.04 ± 0.14) and post 10 (1.13 ± 0.20;
ps < 0.02, ds > 0.58) as well as at the respective post-sham time
points (ps < 0.02, ds > 0.34; Figure 2). Within the sham con-
dition, AURC values at each time point were not signiﬁcantly
different, ps > 0.13, ds < 0.22. Finally, an important ﬁnd-
ing was that the only between-group difference was observed
at post 0 where the AURC value in young adults was signif-
icantly larger than the value obtained for older adults at that
time point (p = 0.01, d = 0.85; Figure 2). Thus, the interaction
between AGE and TIME was predominantly driven by older group
showing AURC value changes in time-dependent manner (i.e.,
delayed response to anodal stimulation), whereas the responses
in young group were unchanged across time points following
stimulation.
Interestingly, all main effects and interactions including SEX
and/orBDNFasafactorwerenotstatisticallysigniﬁcant,Fs<1.47,
ps > 0.23, η2
p < 0.04, and all were associated with small effect
sizes, suggesting that these factors may not be associated with the
neuroplastic changes following anodal tDCS.

INTER-INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY OF RESPONSES TO ANODAL tDCS
Inspection of each individual’s data revealed that despite group
effects indicating a signiﬁcant effect of stimulation, there were
some individuals who did not display the anticipated increase in
AURC following anodal tDCS (Figure 3). Approximately 20% of
total participants, speciﬁcally four young (two males, two females,
M = 24.5, SD = 3.3 years) and four older females (M = 69.0,
SD = 9.3 years), were identiﬁed as non-responders exhibit-
ing AURC values across post-anodal tDCS time points below
1. Responders consisted of 16 (seven males and nine females)
older adults (age range: 60–88 years, M = 67.7, SD = 7.8)
and 15 young (nine males and six females) participants (age
range: 19–29 years, M = 23.0, SD = 3.1). Response to anodal
tDCS did not differ by BDNF genotype (17 Val66Val and 10
Met-carriers in responders), χ2(1, N = 35) = 1.72, p = 0.19,
V = 0.22, age, χ2(1, N = 39) = 0.01, p = 0.94, V = 0.01,
or sex, χ2(1, N = 39) = 0.82, p = 0.37, V = 0.15. In non-
responders, normalized AURC values between anodal and sham
conditions at each time point were not statistically different
(ps > 0.16, ds < 0.41). In both older and younger respon-
ders, there were no signiﬁcant correlations between total IPAQ
score and AURC values at any time point following anodal tDCS
(rs < 0.38, ps > 0.16). Physical activity, therefore, did not appear
to be associated with corticospinal excitability changes induced
by tDCS.
DISCUSSION
The present study was designed to investigate the age-related
changes in the extent of neural plasticity of the corticospinal pro-
jections from primary M1 in response to anodal tDCS. For young

adults the largest potentiation in excitability was observed imme-
diately following a 30 min application of anodal tDCS. Although
AURC values were not signiﬁcantly different between the post-
stimulation time points, only up to 10 min post-anodal tDCS
showed signiﬁcantly higher corticospinal excitability than sham
condition. Although this result is inconsistent with a recent ﬁnd-
ing (Monte-Silva et al., 2013), in which a reduction in corticospinal
excitability relative to baseline was observed following a 26 min
period of anodal stimulation, consistent with the present data is
a report of increased corticospinal excitability following a 40 min
bout of anodal tDCS (Williams et al., 2010). Although we believe
it is extremely unlikely that the single-blinded approach utilized
in the current study affected the results, it may be desirable to
use double-blinded approach in the future studies to remove the
possibility of any confound.
For older adults, in contrast, post-stimulation potentiation was
delayed with the largest response occurring 30 min after the stim-
ulation. Indeed, potentiation immediately after stimulation and
10 min thereafter was signiﬁcantly different to neither sham nor
baseline. Importantly, neither BDNF nor sex appeared to inﬂuence
the neuroplastic changes induced by anodal tDCS. In light of this
ﬁnding, implications for the use of tDCS in older populations are
discussed below.
DELAYED INCREASE IN CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY FOLLOWING
ANODAL tDCS IN OLDER ADULTS
We found that the magnitude of anodal tDCS-induced plasticity
in older adults was not signiﬁcantly reduced (as inferred by way of
inferential statistics) relative to young adults. Although the aver-
age level of potentiation (averaged over the four post-tDCS time
points) was lower in older adults (29% relative to pre-stimulation
levels) than younger adults (41%), the difference was not statisti-
cally signiﬁcant. What was most striking, however, was our novel,
and potentially important, ﬁnding that older adults exhibited a
delayed response to anodal tDCS relative to young adults. As seen
in Figure 2, corticospinal excitability in older adults did not peak
until 30 min after cessation of stimulation, whereas young adults
exhibited their peak potentiation immediately following stimula-
tion. Indeed, at 0 and 10 min after tDCS older adults’corticospinal
excitability was not different from baseline, while young adults
showed signiﬁcant potentiation at these early time points. At 20
and 30 min post-anodal tDCS both groups exhibited signiﬁcant
potentiation relative to baseline.
A number of previous studies have reported a decreased capac-
ity for neuroplastic changes within the motor network with
advancing age, both in response to motor training (Sawaki et al.,
2003; Rogasch et al., 2009 ) and in response to NIBS techniques
including PAS (Fathi et al., 2010) and repetitive TMS (rTMS;
Müller-Dahlhaus et al., 2008; Fathi et al., 2010; Todd et al., 2010).
While PAS and rTMS, including theta burst stimulation (TBS),
protocols are thought to elicit LTP- or LTD-like plasticity by
changing NMDA-dependent glutamatergic transmission (Stefan
et al., 2000; Wolters et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2005, 2007; Zie-
mann et al., 2008), tDCS inﬂuences resting membrane potentials
by affecting sodium and calcium channels or by shifting electri-
cal gradients which inﬂuence the electrical balance of ions across
the neural membrane (Liebetanz et al., 2002). It could therefore
be the case that the delayed, but not diminished, tDCS-induced
plastic changes evident in older adults is a result of the stimula-
tion targeting different plasticity mechanisms than those targeted
by rTMS, TBS and PAS, where age-related declines in plasticity
have been observed. That said, it must be noted that age-related
decline in plasticity is not a ubiquitous ﬁnding, as a number of
papers indicate preserved neural plasticity in response to motor
training (Cirillo et al., 2010, 2011; Hinder et al., 2011, 2013a,b) or
NIBS paradigms (e.g., TBS; Di Lazzaro et al., 2008). These dis-
crepancies between individual studies may perhaps reﬂect large
inter-individual variability in response to training programs or
brain stimulation interventions.
VARIABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS’ RESPONSE TO tDCS
Consistent with recent reports using tDCS (Datta et al., 2012;
López-Alonso et al., 2014; Wiethoff et al., 2014), rTMS (Maeda
et al., 2000; Hamada et al., 2012; López-Alonso et al., 2014), and
PAS (Müller-Dahlhaus et al., 2008; López-Alonso et al., 2014), we
observed that a number (8 out of 39, or approximately 20% of par-
ticipants) of participants did not show the expected corticospinal
excitablity increase following anodal tDCS. The aftereffects of
rTMS protocols including TBS have also been reported to be
highly variable between individuals, irrespective of age (Hamada
et al., 2012). As a consequence, some recent studies have separated
participants into responders and non-responders (e.g., Müller-
Dahlhaus et al., 2008; Hamada et al., 2012). It should be noted that
all those participants in the current study who exhibited reduc-
tions in excitability following anodal tDCS lie within 2 SDs of
the mean response for their age group. As such, given a spread
of responses within a normal distribution, it might be that these
participants did not necessarily display atypical responses. That is,
there was not a bimodal distribution in the present data reﬂecting
those individuals who responded to tDCS in the expected manner,
and those who showed the opposite effect. We suggest, therefore,
that rather than indicating a clear pattern of “responders” and
“non-responders,” the present data indicate variability around the
expected response.
Recently, it has been hypothesized that the inter-individual
variability in response to NIBS may be the result of different popu-
lations of neurons being stimulated more easily in different people
at different times (Hamada et al., 2012). Variability in the response
to TMS may not be due to differences between individuals in the
plasticity of cortical synapses, but instead may result from indi-
vidual differences in the recruitment of cortical neurons (Hamada
et al., 2012). Furthermore, recent modeling analysis has shown
that the current ﬂowing from anodal tDCS is highly inﬂuenced by
variations in cortical gyri/sulci, suggesting that the effects may not
be homogeneous throughout the stimulated area for an individual
and depend on the anatomical characteristics in the individual M1
(Datta et al., 2012). Therefore, the observed variability to anodal
stimulation in the present study could, at least in part, be explained
by individual differences in the anatomical structure of the brain.
In addition, we cannot rule out a possibility that other factors
played roles in the inter-individual variability in the response to
anodal stimulation. Since, for example, emotional states (Baum-
gartner et al., 2007; Coombes et al., 2009) and motor activities
(Koeneke et al., 2006) modulate corticospinal excitability, it may

be useful to apply a questionnaire to investigate emotional state
and activities prior to the assessment.
We also examined whether BDNF gene polymorphism affects
the efﬁcacy of anodal tDCS to induce plasticity. In the human
brain, BDNF is thought to modulate NMDA receptor-dependent
LTP and LTD (Antal et al., 2010). Neuronal activity in response
to experience and environmental demand appears to enhance
the local synthesis/secretion of neurotrophins, which in turn
regulates synaptic efﬁcacy or growth (Rossini et al., 2007). In
contrast to Antal et al. (2010), we did not ﬁnd that individu-
als carrying the Val66Met polymorphism had enhanced anodal
tDCS-induced plasticity compared to Val66Val carriers. Rather,
our results are consistent with two previous studies showing no
difference between BDNF genotypes with regard to corticospinal
excitability changes following cathodal tDCS over M1 (Cheeran
et al., 2008; Di Lazzaro et al., 2012). In the present study, the only
group difference observed was in rMT, with Met carriers showing
signiﬁcantly higher rMT than theVal66Val group. Similarly, we did
not ﬁnd any sex difference in response to anodal tDCS. Although
the present sample was larger than previous studies examining the
relationshipbetweenNIBSinducedplasticityandBDNFgenotype,
studies using much larger sample sizes with a balanced number of
participants across the polymorphism are clearly required before
a deﬁnite conclusion can be drawn regarding the impact of BDNF
on neuroplasticity mechanisms.
POSSIBLE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING DELAYED RESPONSE TO tDCS
AND IMPLICATIONS
Although the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the
delayed response to anodal stimulation in older adults are
unknown, one possibility is that deterioration at the microstruc-
tural level in the aging brain may contribute to the delayed
response. During aging there is progressive accumulation of dam-
aged molecules and impaired energy metabolism in brain cells (Yu
et al., 2002). The aging process compromises neuroprotective and
neurorestorative mechanisms involving glial cells (Yu et al., 2002).
Recently, it has been speculated that tDCS may affect glial cells
rather than neurons directly (Ruohonen and Karhu, 2012). There-
fore, the degradation process with advancing age in glial cells may
be associated with the delayed response to anodal stimulation in
older adults. The next important question is whether the observed
response to anodal tDCS in older adults is as long lasting as the
increased corticospinal excitability relative to baseline in young
adults which persisted for up to 30 min after the stimulation.
Recent studies investigating the effect of tDCS on motor learn-
ing have utilized a “gating” strategy in which the excitability of
M1 is transiently increased via DC stimulation concurrent with
motor task performance(Ziemann and Siebner, 2008). In gating
studies, tDCS is often applied at the initial stage of the learning
(e.g.,Waters-Metenier et al.,2014). Given that older adults showed
delayed potentiation in corticospinal excitability, it may be worth
considering the application of stimulation prior to motor training
in older adults to elicit greatest changes in behavior during motor
performance.
In summary, young adults exhibited the largest potentiation in
corticospinal excitability immediately after the anodal tDCS,while
the potentiation in corticospinal excitability was delayed in older
adults. Notably, we failed to observe differences in neuroplastic
changes following atDCS by BDNF subtypes and sex, suggesting
neuroplastic response following atDCS is possibly independent
from these factors. Future work is warranted to investigate the
association between neuroplasticity induced by NIBS techniques
and skill acquisition in older adults. Further understanding of
the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying neuroplasticity in
older adults has signiﬁcant clinical implications for the improving
of motor function in aging populations and recovery following
stroke.

Abstract
Background: Adaptive shifts in gut microbiome composition are one route by which animals adapt to seasonal
changes in food availability and diet. However, outside of dietary shifts, other potential environmental drivers of gut
microbial composition have rarely been investigated, particularly in organisms living in their natural environments.
Results: Here, we generated the largest wild nonhuman primate gut microbiome dataset to date to identify the
environmental drivers of gut microbial diversity and function in 758 samples collected from wild Ethiopian geladas
(Theropithecus gelada). Because geladas live in a cold, high-altitude environment and have a low-quality grass-based
diet, they face extreme thermoregulatory and energetic constraints. We tested how proxies of food availability
(rainfall) and thermoregulatory stress (temperature) predicted gut microbiome composition of geladas. The gelada
gut microbiome composition covaried with rainfall and temperature in a pattern that suggests distinct responses to
dietary and thermoregulatory challenges. Microbial changes were driven by differences in the main components of
the diet across seasons: in rainier periods, the gut was dominated by cellulolytic/fermentative bacteria that
specialized in digesting grass, while during dry periods the gut was dominated by bacteria that break down
starches found in underground plant parts. Temperature had a comparatively smaller, but detectable, effect on the
gut microbiome. During cold and dry periods, bacterial genes involved in energy, amino acid, and lipid metabolism
increased, suggesting a stimulation of fermentation activity in the gut when thermoregulatory and nutritional stress
co-occurred, and potentially helping geladas to maintain energy balance during challenging periods.
Conclusion: Together, these results shed light on the extent to which gut microbiota plasticity provides dietary
and metabolic flexibility to the host, and might be a key factor to thriving in changing environments. On a longer
evolutionary timescale, such metabolic flexibility provided by the gut microbiome may have also allowed members
of Theropithecus to adopt a specialized diet, and colonize new high-altitude grassland habitats in East Africa.

Background
Obtaining sufficient nutrients is a fundamental challenge
for most animals. Yet, the availability and nutritional
content of food can vary temporally and spatially in re-
sponse to changes in climate and geography. Nutritional
demands further vary in response to thermoregulatory
needs and life history processes, such as growth and
reproduction [1, 2]. Animals have evolved a variety of
behavioral and physiological strategies to cope with
these shifting demands, including altered feeding and ac-
tivity patterns and increased mobilization of stored fat to
fuel energetic demands [3–6]. Recently, the gut micro-
biome has been proposed as an additional avenue by
which animals can cope with changing dietary land-
scapes and energetic challenges [7–9]. The gastrointes-
tinal
tract
of
animals
harbors
a
dense
microbial
community that helps to break down and ferment plant
structural carbohydrates, producing short-chain fatty
acids (SCFAs) that can be used as an energy source by
hosts [10–12]. The absorption of SCFAs in the gut may
be particularly important for herbivorous species, such
as foregut and hindgut fermenters, which obtain as
much as 40-90% of their energy requirements from bac-
terial degradation of complex plant polysaccharides [13–
16]. Additionally, variation in gut microbiome compos-
ition affects the efficiency of caloric harvest and the
metabolic programming of the host [11, 17–20]. For in-
stance, in mice (Mus musculus) and humans, obese and
lean individuals have strikingly different gut microbiota
composition, with obese phenotypes being associated
with higher energy extraction from diet and increased
lipogenesis [21–23].
In wild mammals, the gut microbiome responds rapidly
to seasonal and dietary changes [7, 24–29], presumably to
buffer seasonal energetic challenges [7, 26]. For example, a
simultaneous increase in bacterial taxa involved in fiber
fermentation and in SCFA concentrations during the dry
season
may
allow
Mexican
black
howler
monkeys
(Alouatta pigra) to maintain energy balance during ener-
getic shortfalls without changes in activity or ranging pat-
terns [7]. Moreover, gut bacteria increase intestinal
absorptive capacity, energy homeostasis, and fat burning
during cold periods in mice [30], and improve digestive ef-
ficiency and SCFA production in energetically challenged
ruminants living in cold environments and at high-
altitude [31, 32]. These microbial shifts likely come at
some cost. For instance, increases in microbes that im-
prove host metabolism under certain conditions may re-
duce the abundance of microbes that support host
immune function [33, 34]. However, in seasonal and nutri-
tionally challenging environments, enduring these trade-
offs may be necessary for host survival and reproduction.
Geladas (Theropithecus gelada) represent an excellent
system to
investigate
the
relationship between gut
microbiota composition and seasonal variation in host
diet and energy needs. Despite being the only graminiv-
orous primate with up to 90% of their diet comprised of
grass [35, 36], their gastrointestinal tract appears poorly
adapted to this specialization (but see [37, 38] for dental,
manual, and locomotor adaptations), closely resembling
their
closest
phylogenetic
relatives,
baboons
(Papio
spp.)—a taxon that is omnivorous [39]. To compensate,
geladas may rely heavily on their gut microbiota to
maximize
nutrient
extraction
from
grasses,
likely
through hindgut fermentation [39, 40]. Moreover, gela-
das live in a high-altitude, energetically demanding en-
vironment that exhibits marked inter- and intra-annual
fluctuation in rainfall and temperature [35, 41]. During
rainier months, when grass is abundant, they forage al-
most exclusively on aboveground graminoid leaves and
seeds, and during drier months, when grass availability
decreases, they shift heavily to underground foods (rhi-
zomes, roots, corms, bulbs) [35, 42]. This diet provides
distinct challenges. Underground foods are considered a
fallback food for geladas since they take additional time
and effort to harvest, are harder to process, and are re-
lied upon only when grasses are less abundant [35, 38].
Despite being considered a fallback food, these under-
ground foods are rich in starches and carbohydrates,
suggesting that they contain more nutritional energy
than grass [43]. This high amount of energy, however,
comes at some cost: roots and rhizomes are generally
higher in fibers and lignin—and thus harder to digest
than grasses. In addition to these nutritional challenges,
ambient temperatures frequently drop to near freezing,
and the metabolic costs of thermoregulation are known
to strongly influence gelada physiology [44] and the tim-
ing of reproduction [41, 45]. Thus, seasonal dietary shifts
and temperature variation may lead to distinct digestive
and thermoregulatory challenges.
One previous study on geladas from Guassa, Ethiopia,
found that gut microbial communities of adult females
shifted across seasons [40], supporting the hypothesis
that the gut microbiome may help hosts confront envir-
onmental challenges. This study focused on adult fe-
males and assessed seasonal variation by separating the
samples into two categorical seasons (i.e., rainy, dry).
Our study expands on this study by including adult
males, incorporating continuous climatic data across
several years, and examining proxies of thermoregulatory
stress (in addition to diet) as factors that can influence
the composition and function of the gelada gut micro-
biome. Indeed, rainfall and temperature vary independ-
ently of each other and represent distinct ecological
challenges in gelada ecosystems. Therefore, we were
interested in further testing which aspect of gelada
ecology more strongly determines seasonal microbiome
shifts.

The

Mountains
Gelada Research Project (SMGRP) has been collecting
detailed climatologic, demographic, and behavioral data
from this study population since 2006, allowing us to
examine how ecological (rainfall and temperature) and
individual (group membership, sex, reproductive status,
and age) factors influence gelada gut microbiome com-
position. We hypothesized that ecological factors would
be more strongly associated with variation in the gelada
microbiome than individual factors, and that rainfall and
temperature would have independent effects. In particu-
lar, we expected that rainfall, which is a good proxy for
grass availability [35], would have the strongest effect on
the gelada gut microbiome. We predicted that the taxo-
nomic changes associated with rainfall would mainly re-
flect a shift to grass-based versus underground food-
based diet, in order to allow individuals to maximize en-
ergy extraction from those seasonal foods. We found
that the gelada microbiome exhibited drastic shifts re-
lated to climatological variables; but individual variables,
like age and sex, had minimal effects. Rainfall and
temperature exerted independent effects on the micro-
bial composition and predicted function—with rainfall
having a stronger effect on the gelada gut microbiome.
High rainfall, which is correlated with grass availability
[35], was associated with more cellulolytic and fibrolytic
bacterial taxa, when graminoid leaves were the main
food source. Dry periods, when geladas consume more
underground foods [35], were associated with more am-
ylolytic and methanogenic taxa. Cold periods were fur-
ther characterized by more amylolytic taxa, and hot
periods by more methanogenic taxa. In both drier and
colder periods, the gut microbiome shifted to predicted
functions that suggested increased digestive efficiency,
including energy, amino acid, and lipid metabolism.
Overall, gelada gut microbial composition covaried with
diet and temperature in a pattern that suggests plastic but
distinct responses to dietary and metabolic challenges.
Results
The gelada gut microbiome
We identified 3295 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs)
in 758 fecal samples (mean ± SD = 813 ± 243 ASVs per
sample, range = 92-1730) using deep 16S rRNA gene
amplicon sequencing. Most ASVs could be taxonomic-
ally assigned to the phylum (100%), class (99%), and
order level (99%), but assignments decreased substan-
tially at the family (85%) and genus (61%) levels. These
3295 ASVs came from 16 different phyla, 65 families,
and 200 genera (Table S1, Fig. 1, Figures S1-S2). Of the

3295 ASVs, 170 (5%) were present in at least 90% of
samples and form what can be considered the “core
microbiota” of geladas (Table S2). The four most abun-
dant bacterial phyla were Firmicutes (32%), Kiritimatiel-
laeota (formerly called Verrucomicrobiota subdivision 5;
26%), Bacteroidetes (23%), and Spirochaetes (5%) (Table
S1, Fig. 1a). All microbes assigned to Kiritimatiellaeota
were part of the RFP12 family and represent almost one
quarter of the gelada gut microbiome (mean 26%, range
0.02-70%, Fig. 1b). Despite the abundance of RFP12, the
78 ASVs belonging to this group could not be assigned
below the family level. We therefore queried these se-
quences against the NCBI database using BLAST [46, 47].
These RFP12 sequences were most similar (~ 97%) to bac-
terial sequences previously found in the feces of hindgut
herbivorous species (Asiatic elephant, domesticated horse,
Somali wild ass, zebra, and black rhinoceros) [48] and, to
a lesser extent, the rumen of several foregut fermenters
(cattle, yak, red kangaroo; Table S3). Taken together, this
indicates that the RFP12 family is a key microbe for herb-
ivorous species, particularly hindgut fermenters, and likely
plays an important fermentative role in plant digestion in
geladas. Other taxa found at high frequency in the guts of
ruminants and herbivorous hindgut fermenters were also
prevalent in the gelada gut, including many cellulolytic/
fibrolytic (13% Ruminococcaceae, 6% Lachnospiraceae, 4%
Clostridiales vadinBB60 group, 1.5% Fibrobacteraceae)
and fermentative families (5.3% Rikenellaceae, 5% Prevo-
tellaceae, 4.1% Bacteroidales F082) (Table S1, Fig. 1b and
S1). The Spirochaetes phylum was mostly composed of
Treponema (3.5%), a genus involved in lignocellulose deg-
radation [49].
Dietary changes
To examine how seasonal variation in rainfall and
temperature was associated with changes in the gelada gut
microbiome, we used measures of true climatic condi-
tions, including monthly cumulative rainfall (an appropri-
ate proxy of grass availability in the Simiens: [35]) and
average monthly minimum temperature (a proxy of
thermoregulatory constraint: [41, 44]). At the level of
within-sample community diversity (“alpha diversity”), we
found that cumulative rainfall was positively associated
with Shannon evenness (Table 1, Fig. 2a, c) but had no ef-
fect on bacterial richness or Faith’s phylogenetic diversity
(Table S4, Figure S3). Thus, rainfall was associated with
the relative abundance of ASVs within a sample but not
the absolute number of ASVs or their phylogenetic
diversity.
Cumulative rainfall significantly explained 3.3% of the
overall compositional dissimilarity—or beta diversity—
between samples (as measured by Aitchison distance)
(Table 2), which was less than that explained by two
demographic variables: individual identity and unit (so-
cial group) membership (20% and 6%, respectively; Table
2). The first principal component of beta diversity, which
explained 15% of variation, was strongly associated with
rainfall (r = 0.43, t = 12.93, df = 756, p < 0.001, Fig. 2b).
The ASVs that loaded positively on PC1 (i.e., correlated
with higher rainfall, Fig. 2d) were primarily from the
families Prevotellaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnos-
piraceae (Table S5 and S6). By contrast, the ASVs that
loaded negatively on PC1 (i.e., more abundant in low
rainfall, Fig. 2d) belonged to the family RFP12 and a dif-
ferent subset of Ruminococcaceae that were not abun-
dant during the wet season (Table S5 and S6).
Cumulative rainfall predicted the relative abundance
of gut microbes at all taxonomic levels and was signifi-
cantly associated with the relative abundance of 63% of
bacterial families tested (59-81% of taxa at other taxo-
nomic levels, Fig. 3, Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p
values: pBH < 0.05). Thus, across most taxa, there was a
clear contrast in the relative abundance of gut bacteria
between the wet and dry periods (Table S7, Fig. 4). In
wetter periods, there was an increase in several import-
ant fermentative families from the Bacteroides order (in-
cluding Prevotellaceae and Bacteroidaceae), as well as in
several
cellulolytic/fibrolytic
taxa
(Lachnospiraceae,
Fibrobacteraceae, Spirochaetaceae, and several genera
from the Ruminococcaceae; Figs. 4 and 5a), suggesting
improved digestive efficiency of plant cell wall polysac-
charides at a time when the gelada diet consists mainly
of grasses. In particular, nine Prevotella genera as well as
the Bacteroides genus were at higher abundance during
wetter periods than drier periods (Table S7, Fig. 4b).

(Table S7, Fig. 4b). By contrast, the dry season was char-

known to increase the rate of fermentation and digestive
efficiency (Table S7, and Figs. 4 and 5b). Consistent with
our beta diversity analyses, we also found an increase in
the relative abundance of the RFP12 family during the
dry season (Table S7, Fig. 5b).
The taxonomic changes associated with rainfall also
corresponded to changes in the predicted function of
the gelada gut microbiome (as assessed by PICRUSt2:
[50]). During wetter periods, functional changes tended
to reflect the activity of the cellulolytic and fermentative
bacterial taxa. Microbial pathways involved in the trans-
port of molecules through bacterial membranes (e.g.,
ions, sugars, lipids, peptides), DNA replication and re-
pair, and cell motility (Tables S8-S9, Figs. 6, S4 and
S5A) increased. We also found an increase in the metab-
olism of sugars (e.g., starch and sucrose metabolism,
fructose, mannose, and galactose) (Figure S4 and S5A).
Such activity probably reflects the exportation of sugar-
cleaving enzymes and cellulosome complex across the
outer membrane [12, 51] of fibrolytic bacteria (complex
polysaccharides are too big to penetrate directly inside
bacteria and have to be cleaved first) and the absorption
of the soluble oligosaccharides back across the bacterial
membrane [12, 51].
During drier periods, the gelada gut harbored a greater
abundance of bacterial genes involved in energy, amino
acid, and lipid metabolism (Tables S8-S9 and Fig. 6a, c).
In particular, cellular energy production and cellular

activity were enhanced during this period, as evidenced
by increases in pathways involved in the citric acid cycle,
oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid synthesis and
metabolism (Figure S4 and S5B). Other energy metabol-
ism pathways also increased during drier periods, includ-
ing the methane pathway and the carbon fixation
pathways, which are important for generating energy in
anaerobic bacteria (Figure S4 and S5B). Finally, drier
periods were associated with an increase in functions re-
lated to the synthesis of proteinogenic amino acids (e.g.,
tryptophan), the translation and synthesis of proteins
(Figure S4), and the synthesis of lipopolysaccharide.
Note, however, that the average weighted Nearest
Sequence Taxon Index (NSTI) value across all samples
(a measure of how similar bacteria from a sample are to
reference genome sequences) was relatively high in our
sample (mean ± SD = 0.60 ± 0.13) compared to other
mammals [50]. Our results should therefore be inter-
preted with caution, in that they provide a general idea
of the predicted gene family profiles based on bacteria
that were functional characterized in previous studies.
Temperature
Compared to rainfall, minimum temperature had a
much smaller impact on the gut microbiome. Average
minimum temperature did not influence any metric of
alpha diversity (Table 1 and S4, Figure S6A), and ex-
plained only 0.33% of the variation in beta diversity
(Table 2, Figure S6B). Changes in temperature were sig-
nificantly associated with the relative abundance of 5%
of the families (5-22% at other taxonomic levels; Fig. 3;
pBH < 0.05). More specifically, colder temperatures were
characterized by a greater abundance of two amylolytic
genera
(Lactobacillus
and
Streptococcus);

ium sensu stricto 1, Coprococcus 1) and cellulose-
degrading bacteria (Marvinbryantia and two genera
from the Ruminococcaceae family) (Table S7, Figure S7).
By contrast, hotter temperatures were associated with an
increase in Verrucomicrobia, in the methane-producer
Methanobrevibacter, and in several cellulolytic/fibrolytic
genera from the Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae
families (Table S7, Figure S7).
Similar to our taxonomic analysis, we found that
temperature had a much smaller effect on the predicted
function of the gelada gut microbiome (Tables S8-S9,
Figure S8). During colder periods, we found a predicted
increase in bacterial pathways involved in lipid metabol-
ism and energy production (notably in oxidative phos-
phorylation pathway; Figure S8). Other pathways that
increased during colder periods involved DNA repair and
recombination and the bacterial secretion system. During
hotter weather, pathways were more poorly characterized
and less specific, with predicted increases in methane me-
tabolism and ABC transport (a membrane transporter).
Sex, reproductive state, and age
The gut microbiome of females exhibited higher alpha
diversity compared to males, regardless of the metric
(richness, evenness, and Shannon index) (Table 1 and
S4, Figure S9A). Across samples, however, sex explained
little between-sample variation (i.e., < 1%) (Table 2, Fig-
ure S9B). We detected only a handful of bacterial taxa
that were differentially abundant according to sex (Table
S7, Fig. 3). At the phylum level, females harbored more
Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria (particularly from
class Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and
Alphaproteobacteria). At the family and genus levels, fe-
males had more taxa involved in lactic acid metabolism
(Lactobacillaceae, Anaerovibrio), cellulolysis (Saccharo-
fermentans), and regulation of glucose and fat transport
(Erysipelatoclostridium). Males, on the other hand, only
harbored more Pirellulales. No predicted metabolic
pathway differed in abundance between males and
females (Tables S8-S9).
Female reproductive state did not influence any alpha
diversity metric (Table S10, Figure S10A) and was not a
significant factor influencing beta diversity between sam-
ples (Table S11, Figure S10B). Very few taxa were differ-
entially abundant according to female reproductive state
(Table S12 and S13). Pregnant females harbored more
Verrucomicrobiota (class Verrucomicrobiae) and Epsilon-
bacteraeota than cycling and lactating females (Table
S13). In particular, the genus Helicobacter (within the
family Epsiolonbacteroaeto)—a presumed pathogen—was
highly prevalent in pregnant females (Table S13). No

predicted metabolic pathways were found to differ based
on reproductive state (Table S14-S15). Age did not influ-
ence any metric of alpha diversity (Table 1 and S4, Fig-
ure S11A) or beta diversity (Table 2, Figure S11B), and
no bacterial taxa (Table S7) or predicted metabolic path-
ways (Table S8-S9) were differentially abundant between
young and old adults.
Discussion
Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that
changes in the gelada gut microbiome may help animals
cope with seasonal changes in food availability and
thermoregulatory demands. First, the gelada gut micro-
biome was highly plastic and responded rapidly to sea-
sonal fluctuations in climate—particularly rainfall (a
proxy for available foods). Second, an increase in pre-
dicted bacterial functions involved in energy, amino acid,
and lipid metabolism during both drier and colder pe-
riods suggested increased production of SCFAs, and
more
efficient
digestion
during
energetically
and
thermoregulatory challenging periods. We further found
that individual identity and social group explained nearly
a third of the variation of the gelada microbiome, while
other individual traits such as sex, reproductive state,
and age had little effect on gut microbiome composition
and function.
Rainfall was the strongest ecological factor influencing
changes in the gelada gut microbiome, explaining ~ 3.3%
of overall microbiome composition. In particular, cellu-
lolytic/fibrolytic
and
fermentative
bacterial
taxa
in-
creased during wetter periods when grass, which is
mostly composed of cellulose, was the primary food
source, while amylolytic and methanogenic bacterial taxa
increased during drier periods, when geladas incorpo-
rated more starch (i.e., amylose) and lignified food into
their diet. This effect of rainfall on the gut microbiome
was strong, despite the fact that geladas exhibit only
moderate dietary changes across season (i.e., from only
grass to less grass and more underground organs—but
from the same plant species) compared to other mam-
mals living in more seasonal environments, e.g., that
switch from ripe fruits to more folivorous diets [7, 52,
53]. This pattern highlights the importance of the gut
microbiome for geladas in processing their unique diet
across seasons.
The efficiency of grass digestion in wet periods seems
to rely on a syntropy between the first cellulolytic de-
graders (Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Fibrobac-
teraceae, Spirochaetes) and a high diversity of secondary
fermenters (Prevotellaceae and Bacteroidales), which all
increase in abundance during the wet season. The first
degraders attach to the plant cell walls and hydrolyze
cellulose, hemicellulose, and xylan into smaller polysac-
charides and oligosaccharides [12, 51], while secondary
fermenters ferment those soluble polysaccharides into
more simple sugars [10, 54]. Ruminococcaceae and Lach-
nospiraceae are the two main cellulolytic taxa in the
mammalian gut and commonly increase in prevalence
when animals eat more leaves and plants [7, 29]. In
terms of secondary fermenters, Prevotella are widely
known for their role in breaking down non-cellulosic
polysaccharides and pectin [10, 12]. They are the major
constituent (~ 70%) of rumen bacteria [55], and com-
monly increase in high fiber or fruit diets [29, 53, 56,
57]. Members of Bacteroidales—and particularly from
the Bacteroides genus—have some of the largest reper-
toires of carbohydrate degrading activities and are able
to ferment a broad range of plant polysaccharides [10,
58–60]. The increase in these cellulolytic/fibrolytic taxa
and the high versatility of the secondary fermenters
likely allow geladas to optimally extract nutrients from
grasses eaten during wet periods.
In contrast, during drier periods, when geladas relied
more on underground storage organs, we found a corre-
sponding increase in microbial families involved in amy-
lolytic and saccharolytic activities (Succinivibrionaceae,
Streptococcaceae, Christensenellaceae). Interestingly, Suc-
cinivibrionaceae also increased during periods of ener-
getic stress in Tibetan macaques (Macaca thibetana)
[26] and during the dry season in the Hazda hunter
gatherers of Tanzania [61], suggesting that it might help
hosts cope with diet-related energy shortfalls. The gelada
microbiome during the dry season was also character-
ized by an increase in Methanobrevibacter, a genus
containing
hydrogenotrophic
archaea
that
converts
hydrogen and formate into methane [62]. The simultan-
eous enrichment of efficient hydrogen-producers (e.g.,
Christensenellaceae
[63],
Hydrogenoanaerobacterium:
[64]) and formate-producers (Succinivibrionaceae: [65]),
combined with methanogens during the dry season sug-
gest that these taxa work together in syntropy to im-
prove the efficiency of polysaccharide fermentation from
starch in the gut in dry periods [66, 67]. In mice and
humans, a higher abundance of methanogenic archaea
increases calorie harvest from diet, facilitates SCFA pro-
duction by other fermentative bacteria, and stimulates
lipogenesis [66–69].
Finally, drier periods were also characterized by a large
increase in the RFP12 family (i.e., ~ 30% versus ~ 18% in
wetter periods) from the Kiritimatiellaeota phylum. The
RFP12 family remains poorly characterized but is in-
creasingly recognized as being a keystone bacterial group
in the hindgut of horses (Equus ferus caballus) [70–72],
and a common inhabitant of the rumen of sheep (Ovis
aries) or cattle [73–75]. The bacterial sequences belong-
ing to the RFP12 family found in the gelada feces were,
on average, 97% similar to bacterial sequences found in
the feces of various hindgut herbivorous fermenters [48]
Baniel et al. Microbiome            (2021) 9:26 
Page 9 of 20
and, to a lesser extent, in the rumen of foregut fermen-
ters (Table S3). This suggests that the RFP12 family
plays a particularly important, but thus far uncharacter-
ized, digestive role for herbivorous species. In the case of
geladas, it further suggests that it might be a keystone
bacterial group for the digestion of some underground
food components commonly eaten by the geladas during
dry periods.
Overall, the gut microbes present in geladas are poorly
represented by reference bacterial genomes in the two
most common microbial databases: SILVA (updated
2017) [76] and Greengenes 13_8 (updated 2013) [77].
Taxonomic assignment of bacteria beyond the family
level is relatively low (only 65% of our reads were
assigned to genus level) compared to assignment of se-
quences found in captive animals and humans. This
poor taxonomic characterization limits our ability to
understand the metabolic activities of gut microbiome
communities, and highlights the need to generate more
molecular microbial data from a wider range of non-
model
and
wild
organisms.
The
Kiritimatiellaeota
phylum (and in particular the RFP12 family) would be a
good candidate to focus on.
At the functional level, bacterial genes involved in en-
ergy, amino acid, and lipid metabolism increased in
prevalence during the dry season. In particular, meta-
bolic pathways linked to cellular respiration, methano-
genesis, and carbon fixation pathways of prokaryotes
became more common, strongly suggesting that both
bacterial energy production and cellular activity were
stimulated during this time. One interpretation of this
data is that the increase in cellular activity simply re-
flects a dietary switch to starch, which is easier to
hydrolyze than cellulose, and thus might more readily
provoke a stimulation of bacterial activity and carbohy-
drate fermentation. Alternatively, the stimulation of bac-
terial energy metabolism and cellular activity could
reflect a higher production of SCFAs by gut bacteria,
supplying the host with additional energy in periods of
nutrient restriction (when relying on fallback foods) [31,
78]. Similar increases in predicted bacterial energy me-
tabolism have been found in energetically challenging
environments (e.g., high altitude) in several other mam-
malian species and were correlated with higher SCFA
production [31, 32]. Analysis of fecal SCFA profiles in
geladas would help to identify if this is also the case in
this high-altitude species. One caveat to our analysis is
that the accuracy of the PICRUSt2 functional predictions
may be lower than in other studies, especially when
compared to published NSTI values in other mammals
[50]. Previous studies of mammalian gut microbiomes
conducted PICRUSt analyses on bacterial sequences
grouped by OTUs, instead of ASVs. Because OTUs
group sequences with 97% of similarity together, it
removes 3% of genetic variation; and thus by definition
OTUs will be closer to samples from reference genomes,
potentially leading to lower NSTI values. Thus, although
our analyses are reflecting only a limited portion of the
bacterial community of geladas, it is not necessarily a
worse representation than found in previous studies
clustering bacteria by OTUs. Overall, while our pre-
dicted functions might give us a broad profile of the
differences in metabolic activities of gut bacteria in
the dry and wet seasons, they are not as precise as
functional
characterization
from
metagenomic
or
metabolomic data.
While it is clear that the gelada diet shifts during drier
periods, it remains unknown if (and to what extent)
geladas are nutritionally or energetically constrained
during this time. Grass availability declines and geladas
spend more time foraging and digging for underground
plant parts during the dry season [35, 42]. Such under-
ground foods are usually considered fallback foods be-
cause individuals rely on them only when grass is less
available and because they require long processing times
[35, 38]. However, one study [42] found that geladas
obtain just as much, or even more, calories from under-
ground storage organs as they do from grass. Whether
this increased caloric intake is offset by increased for-
aging costs is currently unknown. However, even if in-
creased foraging costs were demonstrated, our data
suggests that the gut microbiota may increase digestive
efficiency from starchy food and thereby help geladas
maintain or improve energetic status during the dry
season. Future studies on seasonal changes in energy
balance will help resolve this issue.
In contrast to the effect of rainfall, we found mixed
evidence for the effect of temperature on the gut micro-
biome. Temperature only explained ~ 0.33% of variation
in the gelada gut microbiome composition. Furthermore,
few taxa shifted in abundance between the coldest and
hottest months, and most taxa affected by temperature
were also affected by rainfall. This might be explained by
the fact that rainfall (and thus diet) covaries with
temperature to some extent (Pearson’s correlation coeffi-
cient = 0.20): geladas rely the most on underground
foods in the hot-dry season (Feb. to May) and the most
on grass on the cold-wet season (Jun. to Sep.) [35]. The
cold-dry season (Oct. to Jan.), however, displays a mixed
pattern of diet and temperature: grass availability is still
high in Oct.-Nov. (following the rainy season) but de-
creases markedly in Dec.-Jan. [35, 41]. These 2 months
are thus characterized by the introduction of under-
ground foods in the diet and are also the coldest months
of the year, making them likely the most challenging
times for geladas (compounding nutritional and thermo-
regulatory challenges). Accordingly, cold periods were
characterized by an increase in two amylolytic and

taxa
(Streptococcus,
Lactobacillus),
presumably to more efficiently extract starch from the
underground foods. At the functional level, the energy
and lipid metabolism of bacteria were also stimulated in
the cold months, further suggesting some role of gut
bacteria in stimulating host digestive efficiency and en-
ergy metabolism during thermoregulatory-demanding
times.
These seasonal changes that increase energy pro-
duction during colder periods may come at some
cost. Such trade-offs have been proposed where shifts
that benefit one aspect of host physiology conse-
quently lead to a decrease in other microbes that may
also be necessary for the host. For example, microbes
that promote host digestive efficiency and energy me-
tabolism may also promote inflammation or even sup-
press immune function [33, 79]. We did not detect
any obvious evidence of these tradeoffs in geladas,
but future work that incorporates detailed host im-
munological and functional microbial data is needed
to help determine if such trade-offs exist.
Finally, the present study found that the gelada gut
microbiome was largely explained by individual identity
(20%), a pattern consistent with data from a range of
vertebrates [40, 80–82], including humans [83, 84].
However, the effect of social group was lower in geladas
than reported for other social mammals (geladas: 6.0%
vs., e.g., yellow baboon, Papio cynocephalus: 18.6% of
variation explained [85], black howler monkey: 14% [86],
ring-tailed lemurs, Lemur catta: 21% [87], Welsh Moun-
tain ponies: 14%: [82]). The combination of large indi-
vidual effects with weak social group effects closely
resembles data reported for the Guassa gelada popula-
tion [40], suggesting a general, but consistent pattern.
The weak unit-level effects may result from the unique
social system of geladas: Because social units often ag-
gregate into large bands whose composition changes
regularly, geladas may have a higher rate of inter-unit
microbial transmission compared with other primates.
Future studies should explore in more detail the intra-
individual fluctuation in gut microbiome composition,
and whether group differences in ranging patterns may
explain these differences.
Other individual predictors, namely, age, sex, and female
reproductive state, had a very limited effect on the gut
microbiome, mirroring results in other mammals (yellow
baboons: [28, 85], ring-tailed lemurs: [87], Verreaux’s si-
fakas, Propithecus verreauxi: [29], chimpanzees, Pan trog-
lodytes schweinfurthii: [88], rhesus monkeys, Macaca
mulatta: [89], Welsh Mountain ponies [82], domestic dog,
Canis lupus familiaris: [90], but see black howler mon-
keys: [34] or Egyptian fruit bats, Rousettus aegyptiacus:
[80]). Although female geladas harbored higher microbial
richness than males, this resulted in minimal differences
in gut microbial composition and predicted function.
Compared to males, females had higher abundance of Pro-
teobacteria and Lactobacillus. These two bacterial taxa
were previously reported to increase during pregnancy
and lactation in humans and non-human primates [27,
91], and act as early colonizers of the infant gut [92–94].
Additionally, pregnant female geladas harbored more
Helicobacter, a potentially pathogenic genus [95, 96]. An
increase in potentially pathogenic microbes in pregnant
females was also observed in black howler monkeys [34]
and was hypothesized to be the consequence of a trade-off
between reproduction and immunity. These dynamics
warrant further investigation.
Overall, the gut microbiome of geladas seems to be
highly plastic and can respond rapidly to changes in host
diet and thermoregulatory demands. Stimulation of bac-
teria cellular activity could allow geladas to maintain ad-
equate or even improved energetic balance during dry
and cold periods. Our study adds to an increasing body
of literature suggesting that the gut microbiota is an im-
portant system providing dietary and metabolic flexibil-
ity for the host and might be a key factor influencing the
acclimatization to changing environments [8, 48, 97, 98].
In addition to fostering phenotypic plasticity, the gut
microbiome is increasingly hypothesized to contribute to
host evolution and speciation [97–99] given the strong
host phylogenetic signal in mammalian microbiome
composition and function [100, 101] and evidence of
microbiome heritability [102–104]. To the extent that
microbiomes affect host phenotypes under selection,
they will also affect host evolutionary trajectories. In the
case of geladas, a shift in gut microbiome composition
was probably an important adaptive mechanism that
allowed members of the Theropithecus genus to adopt a
specialized dietary niche and diversify rapidly from Papio
~ 5 million years ago [105]. Contrary to host adaptive
genetic mutations, which occur over the course of many
generations, the gut microbiota can shift in response to
changes in host diet in a matter of days [9]. Given that
the common ancestor of Theropithecus and Papio was
omnivorous [106, 107], dietary flexibility provided by the
gut microbiome may have been an important first step
allowing members of Theropithecus to exploit new grass-
land habitats in East Africa, leading to the evolution of a
specialized diet and, ultimately, further genetic and
phenotypic adaptation.
Conclusion
The gut microbiome of geladas is plastic and responds
rapidly to changes in host diet and thermoregulatory de-
mands. These shifts appear to help geladas cope with
seasonal fluctuations in nutrient intake and energy
homeostasis, potentially allowing them to maintain en-
ergy balance in challenging seasonal environments. Our

study adds to an increasing body of literature suggesting
that the gut microbiota is an important system that pro-
vides metabolic flexibility for the host, and is key to
helping hosts adapt and shift to fluctuating environ-
ments. Future research in geladas and other animals will
further uncover how the gut microbiota allows hosts to
occupy unique dietary niches, potentially allowing host
lineages to expand into new habitats, and facilitating
speciation.
Material and methods
Study population and fecal sample collection
We collected fecal samples from a wild population of
geladas living in the Simien Mountains National Park, in
northern Ethiopia (13° 15′ N, 38° 00′ E). Samples were
collected over a 4-year period between Jan. 2015 and
Feb. 2019. Geladas live in multi-level societies, where re-
productive units (comprising a leader male, several adult
females, their offspring, and occasionally 1–2 follower
males) and bachelor groups (comprising between 1 and
10 adult males) form the smallest levels of the society
that forage and sleep together in a “band” sharing the
same home range [108]. Since Jan. 2006, the Simien
Mountains Gelada Research Project (SMGRP) has col-
lected demographic and behavioral data on over 200 in-
dividuals from two bands. All individuals are habituated
to
human
observers
on
foot
and
are
individually
recognizable. Dates of birth of individuals were estab-
lished using a combination of known (N = 42) and esti-
mated (N = 89) birth dates. Estimated birth dates were
calculated by using the mean individual age at major
life-history milestones in our population (e.g., sexual
maturation or first birth for females and canine eruption
for males) [109, 110]. Birth dates of unknown immigrant
males were estimated using an established protocol
based on body size and other age-related morphological
characteristics [110]. Here, we focused only on samples
from
adult
males
and
females.
Adult
males
were
included when they reached 7 years of age. At this age,
males have reached adult body size in stature but not in
weight [110, 111], and most males have dispersed into a
non-natal group (i.e., 96% of our male samples, males
could thus be leaders, followers, bachelors, or natals).
Adult females were included after they had experienced
their first sex skin swelling, a marker of reproductive
maturation (which is around 4.65 years old in our
population [109]).
Fecal samples of known adult and subadult male and
female subjects were collected regularly and opportunis-
tically
during
the
study
period.
Immediately
upon
defecation, approximately 1.5 g of feces was collected in 3
ml of RNA later [112, 113], stored at room temperature
for up to 2 months, and subsequently shipped to the Uni-
versity of Washington (UW). At UW, samples were stored
at −80 °C until the sequencing libraries were prepared. A
total of 758 samples (620 female samples, 138 male sam-
ples) were collected from 131 individuals (83 females, 48
males) (mean ± SD = 5.79 ± 6.14 samples per individual,
range = 1-21) from 28 reproductive units and 4 bachelors
groups (mean ± SD = 4.69 ± 2.97 number of individuals
sampled per unit, range = 1-11).
The reproductive state of females at the date of sample
collection was assigned based on daily monitoring of in-
dividuals for the status of sex skin swellings and the
birth of infants. We assigned the three reproductive
states as follows: (1) Cycling began at the first sign of
postpartum sex skin swelling and ended when a female
conceived—with conception defined as 183 days (mean
gestation length) before the birth of a subsequent infant
[109]. (2) Pregnancy started on the date of conception
and ended the day before parturition. (3) Finally, lacta-
tion started on the day of parturition and ended the day
before the female’s first postpartum swelling. Lactating
females were further categorized as being in early lacta-
tion (infant < 1 year old) or late lactation (infant > 1 year
old). When testing the effect of reproductive state, late
lactating females were removed from the lactating cat-
egory to include only females that were still nursing at
the time of sample collection (females resume cycling
when infants are ~ 1.5 years old in our population, which
is presumably accompanied by infant weaning around
the same time [109]). Furthermore, because pregnant fe-
males can abort their fetus during male takeover of their
reproductive unit [114], some pregnancies might have
been misidentified as cycling based on our method of
back-calculating from the date of birth. We therefore re-
moved cycling females that experienced a takeover in
the previous 6 months before the date of sample collec-
tion (N = 55 samples) to avoid any misclassification of
reproductive state in our analyses.
Study site and climatic data
The study area is located at 3200 m above sea level and
is characterized as an Afroalpine grassland ecosystem,
consisting of grassland plateaus, scrublands, and Erica-
ceous forests [115]. Fecal samples were collected across
the year, with roughly equal coverage across seasons
(244 in cold-dry, 298 in cold-wet, and 216 in hot-dry
season as defined above). As part of the long-term moni-
toring of the SMGRP, daily cumulative rainfall and mini-
mum and maximum temperature are recorded on a
near-daily basis. We used the total cumulative rainfall
over the 30 days prior to the date of fecal sample collec-
tion as a proxy for grass availability at the time of sample
collection [35]. In addition, we used the average mini-
mum daily temperatures in the 30 days preceding the
date of sample collection as a proxy of thermoregulatory
constraints. The average minimum temperature is less

correlated with cumulative monthly rainfall than the
average maximum temperature in the previous 30 days
(correlation coefficient: 0.25 versus −0.56) and, more im-
portantly, is more likely to reflect the physiological effect
of thermoregulation on the body [41, 44].
DNA extraction, sequencing, and data processing
We prepared 16S sequencing libraries using the proto-
cols developed and optimized by the Earth Microbiome
Project and the University of Minnesota Genomics Core
(UMGC [116];). We extracted microbial DNA from the
fecal samples using Qiagen’s PowerLyzer PowerSoil
DNA Isolation kit (Qiagen #12855) following the stand-
ard protocol. We amplified the hypervariable V4 region
of the 16S rRNA gene using PCR primer set 515F
(TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG
GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 806R (GTCTCG
TGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGGAC
TACNVGGGTWTCTAA
T) from The Human Microbiome Project and a dual-
indexing approach [116]. Details of the amplification
protocol can be accessed at https://smack-lab.com/
protocols/. The first PCR round aimed at amplifying the
V4 region. Each 25 μl PCR reaction well consisted of
12.5 μl of Nebnext Ultra II Q5 mastermix, 1.0 μl of each
primer, and 25 ng of total DNA in 10.5 μl of nuclease-
free water. PCR was performed in an Eppendorf thermo-
cycler with a 100 °C heated lid using the following cyc-
ling steps: an initial denaturing for 5 min at 95 °C;
followed by 15 cycles of 20 s at 98 °C, 15 s at 62 °C, 60 s
at 72 °C, and a final hold at 4 °C. We cleaned up the
PCR reaction with a 2:1 ratio of SPRI beads to PCR
amplified DNA. The second PCR round aimed at adding
a unique index primer combination to molecularly bar-
code each sample. We took 4 μl of product from the first
PCR and added 6 μl of Nebnext Ultra II Q5 mastermix
and 1 μl of n5 and n7 indexing primers, with each sam-
ple being assigned a unique n5/n7 index primer combin-
ation. This 12 μl reaction was placed in an Eppendorf
thermocycler with a 100 °C heated lid, denatured for 5
min at 95 °C, and amplified with 10 cycles of 20 s at
98 °C, 15 s at 55 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C with a final hold at
4 °C. After a 2:1 SPRI bead clean-up, amplification of the
V4 region was confirmed in a few samples using an
AATI fragment analyzer, and all libraries were quantified
using a qubit fluorometer. The libraries were then
pooled in roughly equimolar amounts (each with their
own unique indexing primer combination), spiked with
10% PhiX to increase library complexity, and sequenced
together on a single Illumina NovaSeq 6000 SP 250 bp
paired-end sequence flowcell.
We analyzed the resulting data using the Quantitative
Insights Into Microbial Ecology 2 (QIIME2) platform
[117, 118]. After trimming low-quality bases from the
de-multiplexed reads, we merged overlapping paired-end
reads, and denoised the sequencing data by filtering and
correcting Illumina amplicon sequencing errors using
the Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm 2 (DADA2:
[119]) plugin incorporated in QIIME2. DADA2 infers se-
quences exactly resulting in amplicon sequence variants
(ASVs). Forward and reverse reads were trimmed to 220
and 180 bases, respectively, to remove the low-quality
portion of the sequences. The forward and reverse reads
were then merged together and chimeric sequences were
removed. Only samples with more than 20,000 reads
were retained for analyses (following observation of rar-
efaction curves, Figure S12). After filtering, trimming,
merging, and chimera removal, we retained a total of
348,390,395 reads across the 758 fecal samples (459,618
± 815,020 reads per sample, range = 20,109-10,735,588).
ASVs were taxonomically assigned using the q2-feature
classifier in QIIME2 against version 132 of the SILVA
database (updated December 2017) [76] based on 100%
similarity.
Uninformative
taxonomic
assignments
of
ASVs found in SILVA (e.g., “wallaby metagenome,” “un-
assigned bacteria,” etc.) were converted to “NA” to sim-
plify analyses at higher taxonomic levels. All ASVs
belonging to the order WCHB1-41 (phylum Kiritimatiel-
laeota) were not assigned at the family level in the
SILVA classification. However, in the Greengene classifi-
cation (version 13_8) [77], all ASVs from this order in
the gelada gut were assigned to the RFP12 family. Thus,
we attribute the family RFP12 to all ASVs from the
order WCHB1-41 in SILVA classification. The 78 ASVs
from the RFP12 family were found in particular high
proportion in the gelada feces, but we did not have taxo-
nomic
information
about
those bacterial
sequences
below the family level. We thus mined previously pub-
lished data to identify bacterial sequences most similar
to the 78 RPF12 ASVs in geladas by using the NCBI
BLAST search engine [46, 47]. For each of those 78
ASV, we searched for the most similar nucleotide se-
quences previously published, extracted its top five hits
(i.e., most similar sequences based on the E value), and
summarized the distribution of those top hits per ASV
across the 78 ASVs (including in which animal species
those hits were found, see Table S3). The five top hits
had an average of 97% nucleotide similarity (range, 93-
100%) with their respective similar gelada ASVs.
Statistical analyses
The count and taxonomy files generated by QIIME2 were
imported into R version 3.5.2 [120] using the qiime2R
package [121] and analyzed using the phyloseq package
[122]. The majority of the 19,606 ASVs in our dataset
were found at very low frequency or only in one sample
(71% of ASVs were found in only one sample and 6.2% of
ASVs were not assigned at the phylum level). Thus, we
Baniel et al. Microbiome            (2021) 9:26 
Page 13 of 20
further filtered the count table to retain only ASVs that
had at least 500 reads in total in the dataset (i.e., 0.00014%
relative abundance) to eliminate potentially artifactual se-
quences. With this filtering criteria, only 3295 ASVs
remained, with all of them assigned at the phylum level
and most (97%) observed in at least two samples (Figure
S13). The use of rarefaction (i.e., subsampling of the read
count in each sample to a common sequencing depth) has
been discouraged due to the loss of information and preci-
sion [123], as well as the use of count normalization
methods from the RNA-seq field (e.g., DESeq2 or edgeR).
However, microbiome datasets are more sparse (zero-in-
flated) and more asymmetrical than genetic expression
datasets [124, 125]. Thus, we used a compositional
approach
when
possible
(e.g.,
centered-log-ratio
normalization of the counts and Aitchison distance for
beta diversity analysis) [125, 126], controlling for sample
sequencing depth in multivariate analyses to account for
repeated samples from the same individual.
We replicated alpha- and beta-diversity analyses using
traditional rarefaction methods to facilitate comparisons
with other studies. To generate the rarefied dataset, we
randomly sampled 20,000 reads from the raw fastq files
of each sample and processed this new rarefied dataset
into the DADA2 pipeline. This dataset was further fil-
tered to remove the low-frequency ASVs (i.e., ASVs not
included in the pool of 3295 ASVs retained in the full
dataset). This resulted in a dataset containing the same
758
samples,
with
2853
ASVs
and
with
relatively
homogenous sequencing depth (18205 ± 1415 reads per
sample, range = 7460-19444). We rarefied reads from
the raw fastq files prior to DADA2 processing instead of
the traditional approach of rarefying after DADA2 using
the rarefy_even_depth function of the phyloseq package
[122] because the traditional approach did not eliminate
the effect of sequencing depth (post-DADA2) on the
alpha diversity metrics in the rarefied dataset. Sub-
sampling the raw fastq files allowed us to better gen-
erate indices of alpha diversity per sample that did
not depend on the total number of reads obtained
initially for the sample.
All mixed models described below were run using
either the lmer (for linear mixed models, LMMs) or
glmer (for binomial and negative binomial generalized
linear mixed models, GLMMs) functions of the lme4
package [127]. All quantitative variables (i.e., cumulative
rainfall,
averaged
temperature,
and
age)
were
z-
transformed to have a mean of zero and a standard devi-
ation of one to facilitate model convergence. The signifi-
cance of the fixed factors was tested using a likelihood
ratio test, LRT (assuming an asymptotic chi-square dis-
tribution of the test statistic) via the drop1 function. To
test for significant pairwise differences between levels of
multilevel categorical variables (i.e., reproductive state),
post hoc Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference tests
were carried out using the multcomp package in R
[128].
Alpha-diversity analyses
We calculated three measures of alpha diversity: observed
richness (the total number of different ASVs in a sample),
Shannon diversity index (accounts for both richness and
evenness of ASVs in a sample), and Faith’s phylogenetic
diversity (accounts for phylogenetic distance between bac-
terial species, using the picante package [129]). We mod-
eled each alpha diversity metric using linear mixed
models: (i) as a function of age, sex, cumulative monthly
rainfall, average monthly minimum temperature, and se-
quencing depth of the sample (N = 758 samples), and (ii)
as a function of reproductive state (cycling, early lactating,
and pregnant), age, cumulative monthly rainfall, and aver-
age monthly minimum temperature in samples collected
from females (N = 439). Individual identity and unit mem-
bership were included as random effects to control for in-
dividual and unit repetition across samples. We also ran
the same models on the rarefied dataset (Table S16).
Beta-diversity analyses
We then assessed how the same predictors were associ-
ated with between-sample community dissimilarity. To
account for differences in sequencing depth between
samples, the counts were normalized using the centered-
log-ratio (CLR) method (and using a pseudo count of
0.65 for zero counts) from the “compositions” package
[130]. We then calculated the Aitchison distance be-
tween
samples
(i.e.,
simply
the
Euclidean
distance
between samples after clr transformation of the counts)
[131] and conducted a Principal Component Analysis
(PCA)
(function
“prcomp”)
to
visually
represent
between-samples dissimilarity according to the predic-
tors. This approach has been recommended for micro-
biome datasets [125] and allows for the projection of
each sample onto individual principal components (PCS)
and the variable loadings of ASVs onto each PC. While
the first axis of variation correlated mostly with rainfall
(Fig. 2b), the second PCA axis was correlated with se-
quencing depth and explained 11% of the variation (Fig-
ure S14). We used Permutational Multivariate Analysis
of Variance (PERMANOVA) tests to assess the effect of
the predictors on the Aitchison distance between sam-
ples (using 10,000 permutations and the “adonis2” func-
tion from the “vegan” package [132]). We ran three
different models: (1) including all samples where we
tested only the effect of individual identity and sequen-
cing depth, (2) including all samples where we tested the
effect of unit, age, sex, cumulative monthly rainfall, aver-
age monthly minimum temperature, and sequencing
depth of the sample, and (3) including only female

samples where we tested the effect of unit, reproductive
state, age, cumulative monthly rainfall, and average
monthly minimum temperature. In models 2 and 3, indi-
vidual
identity
was
included
as
a
blocking
factor
(“strata”) to control for repeated sampling. We also rep-
licated beta diversity analysis on the rarefied dataset. We
ran PERMANOVA tests using three complementary
pairwise dissimilarity metrics (Bray-Curtis distance, un-
weighted and weighted UniFrac distances) to assess
between-sample variation according to the same predic-
tors (the same three models). Beta diversity results
remained qualitatively similar (Table S17).
Differential abundance testing
We examined how our predictors were associated with
differential abundance of bacteria (at the phylum, class,
order, family, and genus levels) using negative binomial
GLMMs. Compared to LMMs, negative binomial mixed
models are better equipped to handle over-dispersed
and zero-inflated distributions that often characterize
microbiome datasets [133]. They also facilitate tests of
several independent predictors while taking into account
longitudinal designs including random effects. We first
aggregated the counts (i.e., the number of reads per taxa
and per sample) at the taxonomic level of interest. Only
taxa that had an average relative abundance across sam-
ples ≥0.01% were tested. Then, for a given taxa, the
count per sample was modeled as a function of (1) age,
sex, cumulative monthly rainfall and averaged monthly
minimum temperature (all samples), or (2) female repro-
ductive state, age, cumulative monthly rainfall, and aver-
aged monthly minimum temperature (female samples
only). The log-transformed number of reads per sample
was included as an offset term to control for variation in
sequencing depth across samples. Individual identity and
unit membership were included as random effects in all
models. When negative binomial models failed to con-
verge in some taxa, we converted the counts in pres-
ence/absence and modeled them with binomial GLMMs.

Functional profiling of microbiota
We estimated the bacterial and archaeal genes present
in the metagenomes of each sample using Phylogenetic
Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of
Unobserved States version 2 (PICRUSt2) [50]. In brief,
ASVs were aligned to reference sequences using HMME
R [134] and placed into a reference tree using EPA-NG
[135] and Gappa [136]. PICRUSt2 normalizes for mul-
tiple 16S gene copies in bacteria using castor, a hidden
state prediction tool [137]. The normalized data were
used to predict gene family profiles, and mapped onto
gene pathways using MinPath [138]. We followed the
default protocols outlined on the PICRUSt2 GitHub
page (https://github.com/picrust/picrust2/wiki). We in-
vestigated the predicted gene families using the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthology
(KO) database. The accuracy of the PICRUSt2 predic-
tions for each sample was assessed by calculating the
weighted Nearest Sequence Taxon Index (NSTI) score, a
measure of how similar the bacteria from the sample are
to reference genome sequences. Five ASVs (out of 3295)
had a NSTI score > 2 and were removed from our final
predictions. The association between the relative abun-
dance of functional categories as estimated by PICRUSt2
and the predictors (on all samples or female samples
only) were examined using LMMs. Only functional path-
ways that had ≥0.1% relative abundance across samples
were tested. Individual identity and unit membership
were included as random effects in all models.

core ASVs (i.e. present in at least 90% of samples) in the gelada gut at
the order level. Table S3. Summary of the most similar bacterial
sequences to the 78 ASVs belonging to the RFP12 family found in
geladas feces. For each gelada RFP12 ASV, we searched the most similar
nucleotide sequences found previously on NCBI BLAST, extracted its top
five hits (i.e. most similar sequences based on Evalue) and summarized
the distribution of those top hits across the 78 ASVs (identifying those
animals in which similar sequences were found). Table S4. Predictors of
observed richness and Faith’s phylogenetic diversity (PD). Estimates with
p-values <0.05 are highlighted in bold. Table S5. Loading scores of ASVs

taxa preceded by a “*” were modeled with a binomial GLMM, with pres-
ence/absence as the outcome variable. Table S8. Differential abundance

sample dissimilarity. 10000 permutations were carried out and individual
identity was added as a strata in the model. The R-squared values indi-
cate the amount of between-sample variation explained by each variable.

represent the partial residuals from the LMM (i.e. showing the association
between cumulative rainfall and alpha diversity, while controlling for all
other predictors). The blue line and confidence intervals come from a lin-
ear regression (for representation only). One and 5 outlier samples (with
a particularly low diversity) were omitted for panel A and B respectively
for clarity of representation. Supplemental Figure 4. Bacterial functional
pathways that significantly associated with cumulative rainfall at KO level

on the relative abundance of each pathway per sample. Only pathways
with pBH < 0.05 were considered significant. For ease of representation,
only pathways with effect sizes > |0.006| are represented. The full list can
be found in Table S9. Classification of KO level 3 pathways in broader cat-

(both level 3 and initially in Genetic Information Processing at level 2)
were reclassified in “Transcription & Translation"" and ""Replication and Re-
pair"" respectively. The category “Membrane Transport & Cellular Signal-

Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) infiltrate adipose tissue during obesity and contribute to insulin resis-
tance. We hypothesized that macrophages migrating to adipose tissue upon high-fat feeding may differ from 
those that reside there under normal diet conditions. To this end, we found a novel F4/80+CD11c+ population 
of ATMs in adipose tissue of obese mice that was not seen in lean mice. ATMs from lean mice expressed many 
genes characteristic of M2 or “alternatively activated” macrophages, including Ym1, arginase 1, and Il10. Diet-
induced obesity decreased expression of these genes in ATMs while increasing expression of genes such as 
those encoding TNF-α and iNOS that are characteristic of M1 or “classically activated” macrophages. Interest-
ingly, ATMs from obese C-C motif chemokine receptor 2–KO (Ccr2-KO) mice express M2 markers at levels similar 
to those from lean mice. The antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10, which was overexpressed in ATMs from lean 
mice, protected adipocytes from TNF-α–induced insulin resistance. Thus, diet-induced obesity leads to a shift 
in the activation state of ATMs from an M2-polarized state in lean animals that may protect adipocytes from 
inflammation to an M1 proinflammatory state that contributes to insulin resistance.
Introduction
Recent investigations suggest that obesity gives rise to a state 
of chronic, low-grade inflammation that contributes to insulin 
resistance and type 2 diabetes (1, 2). Although the tissues and cell 
types involved in this inflammatory response are not fully under-
stood, there is significant interest in the role of adipose tissue 
macrophages (ATMs) in the inflammatory changes characteristic 
of obesity (3). In both humans and rodents, ATMs accumulate 
in adipose tissue with increasing body weight and their quantity 
correlates with measures of insulin resistance (4–6). In obese sub-
jects, ATM content is higher in visceral than subcutaneous adi-
pose tissue, consistent with the hypothesis that visceral fat plays 
a more prominent role in insulin resistance (7). Moreover, weight 
loss leads to a reduction in both inflammatory markers and ATM 
content (4, 7). ATMs are a prominent source of proinflammatory 
cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 that can block insulin action in 
adipocytes, providing a potential link between inflammation and 
insulin resistance (6, 8).
Mouse models have demonstrated that ATMs are both neces-
sary and sufficient for the development of insulin resistance with 
obesity. Mice with targeted deletions in the genes for monocyte 
chemoattractant protein–1 (Mcp1/Ccl2) and its receptor C-C motif 
chemokine receptor 2 (Ccr2) both have decreased ATM content, 
decreased inflammation in fat, and protection from high-fat 
diet–induced (HFD-induced) insulin resistance (9, 10). Converse-
ly, mice overexpressing MCP-1 have increased numbers of ATMs 
along with increased insulin resistance (9, 11). Moreover, myeloid-
specific KO of IκB kinase β (Ikbkb) produced mice with improved 
insulin sensitivity on HFD (12). Together, these data suggest that 
both the recruitment and proinflammatory activation of ATMs 
are required for the development of diabetes with obesity.
While quantitative changes in ATM content with obesity and 
diabetes are well supported, little is known about the range of 
ATM function and how this may change with obesity. ATMs are 
present in moderate quantities in adipose tissue of lean mice 
in which inflammatory signals are low or nonexistent (5, 6), 
and their role there is unclear. While Ccr2-KO (CCR2KO) and 
Mcp1-KO mice have lower inflammatory cytokine expression 
in fat, they retain significant macrophage content within adi-
pose tissue (9, 10). This suggests that factors both dependent 
and independent of the MCP-1/CCR2 axis are involved in mac-
rophage recruitment to fat and, further, that not all ATMs are 
programmed for proinflammatory signaling.
Macrophages show significant heterogeneity in function, as local 
environmental factors shape their properties and activation state 
(13, 14). Different stimuli activate macrophages to express distinct 
patterns of chemokines, surface markers, and metabolic enzymes 
that ultimately generate the diversity of macrophage function seen 
in inflammatory and noninflammatory settings. Macrophage acti-
vation has been operationally defined across 2 separate polarization 
states, M1 and M2 (13, 14). These states have largely been defined 
in vitro, and tissue macrophages are likely activated along a con-
tinuum between these states in vivo. M1 or “classically activated” 
macrophages are induced by proinflammatory mediators such as 
LPS and IFN-γ. M1 macrophages have enhanced proinflammatory 
cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12) and generate reactive oxy-
gen species such as NO via activation of iNOS (Nos2).
M2 or “alternatively activated” macrophages are generated in 
vitro by exposure to IL-4 and IL-13 (15). M2 macrophages have 
low proinflammatory cytokine expression and instead generate 
high levels of antiinflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-1 decoy 
receptor. Additionally, arginase production is increased in M2-
polarized macrophages. This enzyme blocks iNOS activity by a 
variety of mechanisms, including competing for the arginine sub-
strate that is required for NO production (16). Overall, M2 mac-

rophages are believed to participate in the blockade of inflam-
matory responses and in the promotion of tissue repair (13). M2 
polarization can occur in the absence of IL-4 or IL-13, suggesting 
that this state may be induced by several different factors (17). 
Moreover, recent studies have shown that IL-4–mediated M2 
polarization is associated with the activation of transcription fac-
tors involved in lipid oxidative metabolism that include PPARγ 
and PPARγ coactivator 1β (PGC-1β) (18).
In mice, distinct monocyte subsets contribute to tissue inflam-
matory responses (13, 19). Noninflamed tissues are populated 
with macrophages derived from CX3CR1hiCCR2– monocytes 
(20). In contrast, acute inflammation increases the levels of 
CX3CR1loCCR2+Ly-6Chi monocytes, which have a higher capac-
ity for migration into inflamed tissues compared with other 
monocyte populations (21). This model is consistent with obser-
vations that CCR2KO mice have decreased ATM content (10), 
presumably due to deficient recruitment of CX3CR1loCCR2+ 
monocytes with retention of the trafficking of CX3CR1hiCCR2– 
monocytes into adipose tissue.
The qualitative differences between these monocyte/macrophage 
subtypes in ATMs and obesity are unknown but may be impor-
tant in understanding the biology of these unique cells and their 
contribution to diabetes. In this regard, we show here that ATMs 
undergo a phenotypic switch from an antiinflammatory M2 polar-
ization state to a proinflammatory M1 polarization state upon 
high-fat feeding, in the process losing their protective capacity.
Results
F4/80+CD11b+CD11c+ macrophages accumulate in fat with diet-induced 
obesity. As the majority of previous studies have used F4/80 expres-
sion as a single marker to identify ATMs, we sought to examine 
ATM heterogeneity in lean and obese mice using additional known 
macrophage markers. Epididymal fat tissue plays a significant role 
in overall metabolism in rodents (22). We thus isolated stromal 
vascular fraction (SVF) cells from epididymal fat pads excised from 
male mice fed a normal diet (ND) or HFD and analyzed cells by 
flow cytometry. ATMs from both lean and obese mice coexpressed 
F4/80 and CD11b, and the majority of the F4/80+CD11b+ cells 
also expressed Mac-3 (data not shown). However, there was varia-
tion in the amount of CD11c expression within the F4/80+CD11b+ 
ATMs. The SVF from lean mice contained 17.8% F4/80+ cells, con-
sistent with other reports (5). Only a small percentage of these cells 
coexpressed CD11c (9.3% ± 7.5%; n = 3 pools of mice) (Figure 1A). 
In contrast, obese mice contained increased F4/80+ cell content 
within the SVF, with a significant increase in the percentage of 
F4/80+CD11c+ cells (38.4% ± 15% of F4/80+ cells; P = 0.04 versus 
lean mice). These cells also expressed CD11b. Similar results were 
seen in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, with 74% of the F4/80+ cells 
coexpressing CD11c (data not shown).

fat pads increased in mice fed an HFD compared with lean mice 
(Figure 1B). Normalizing this data to fat pad weight indicated 
that there was a 5.5-fold increase in the content of F4/80+CD11c+ 
cells in adipose tissue from HFD-fed compared with ND mice 
(Figure 1C). In contrast, there was no significant change in the 
quantity of F4/80+CD11c– cells in adipose tissue per milligram 
fat weight between ND and HFD mice. This demonstrates that 
F4/80+CD11c+ cells are a specific population of ATMs recruited 
to fat tissue upon HFD exposure.
Previous studies indicated that targeted deletion of the Ccr2 gene 
results in decreased macrophage content in adipose tissue and 
improved insulin sensitivity (10). Thus, CCR2KO mice were also 
examined for CD11c expression as a complementary mouse model. 
HFD-fed CCR2KO mice demonstrated a reduction in the content 
of F4/80+CD11c+ cells in the SVF compared with wild-type obese 
mice, with 14.4% ± 9.2% of the F4/80+ cells coexpressing CD11c 
(P = 0.08 versus HFD C57BL/6) (Figure 1D). Normalizing for cell 
number and fat weight indicated that there was a greater than 50% 
reduction in the level of F4/80+CD11c+ ATMs in the CCR2KO mice 
(HFD C57BL/6, 2.4 ± 0.46 × 103 cells/mg versus HFD CCR2KO, 
0.88 ± 0.98 × 103 cells/mg) (Figure 1C). The content of total 
F4/80+CD11c+ cells in fat pads from HFD CCR2KO mice was also 
lower than in obese controls after normalization to cell number 
(Figure 1B). Similar to what was observed previously (10), adipo-
cyte size was increased in HFD CCR2KO mice compared with con-
trol HFD mice (mean 7,933 ± 2,754 μm2 versus 6,704 ± 2,961 μm2,  
P = 0.041) and HFD CCR2KO mice were protected from hepatic 
steatosis (data not shown). Contrary to these observations, how-
ever, we noted increased fat pad weight in HFD CCR2KO mice  
(2.83 ± 0.57 g versus control, 1.41 ± 0.25 g; P = 0.011).
Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed the flow cytometry 
results; ND SVF cultures contained only F4/80+CD11c– cells (Fig-
ure 2A). SVF cells from HFD mice showed a mix of F4/80+CD11c+ 
and F4/80+CD11c– cells. Immunohistochemistry on epididymal 
fat pads from obese mice localized CD11c+ cells in macrophage 
clusters surrounding adipocytes (Figure 2B). The CD11c antibody 
stained a subset of cells in these crownlike structures, while F4/80 
stained nearly all of the cells in these clusters. Scattered individual 
CD11c+ ATMs were observed surrounding adipocytes in what may 
have been early ATM clusters (Figure 2C). Rare CD11c+ cells were 
seen in adipose tissue sections from lean mice.
Increased inflammatory gene expression in F4/80+CD11c+ ATMs. 
Because CD11c+ cells appear to accumulate in adipose tissue after 
high-fat feeding, we assessed expression of inflammatory genes in 
F4/80+CD11c+ ATMs compared with F4/80+CD11c– ATMs from 
obese mice. Real-time RT-PCR showed appropriate sorting of the 
CD11c populations based on expression of integrin, alpha X (Itgax, 
encoding CD11c) (Figure 3). F4/80+CD11c+ cells overexpressed 
the inflammatory genes Il6 (IL-6) and Nos2 (iNOS) compared with 
F4/80+CD11c– ATMs. Tnfa (TNF-α) was not differentially expressed 
between the cell types, while Apoe (apoE) was downregulated in the 
F4/80+CD11c+ population relative to F4/80+CD11c– cells.
ATMs from lean mice express markers of alternatively activated mac-
rophages. Given the low level of inflammatory cytokine expression 
in adipose tissue from lean mice, we examined the ATMs derived 
from lean mice for known markers of alternatively activated M2

macrophages (15, 23). ATMs from lean animals showed increased 
expression of M2-specific genes Il10 (IL-10), Arg1 (arginase I), Mrc2 
(mannose receptor, C type 2), Ym1/Chi3l3 (Ym1/chitinase 3–like 3),  
and Mgl1/2 (macrophage galactose N-acetyl-galactosamine–spe-
cific lectins 1 and 2) compared with the ATMs isolated from HFD 
mice (Figure 4A). In contrast, expression of proinflammatory 
genes such as Tnfa and Nos2 was considerably lower in ND ATMs 
compared with ATMs from obese animals (Figure 4B).
As macrophages make up only a portion of the stromal cells in 
adipose tissue, we examined expression of some of these genes in 
unsorted SVF isolates. Similar patterns of gene expression were 
seen in RNA prepared from SVF cells from lean and obese mice 
(Figure 4, C and D), with increased Ym1 and Il10 expression in ND 
mice and increased Tnfa and Nos2 expression in HFD mice.
Since inflammatory macrophage recruitment into fat tissue 
appears to be partially dependent on CCR2 (10), we hypothesized 
that ATMs in obese CCR2KO mice might retain properties of 
M2-polarized macrophages and thus evaluated gene expression 
in these cells. Indeed, ATMs isolated from obese CCR2KO mice 
expressed alternatively activated macrophage markers at levels that 
were similar to those seen in ATMs from lean mice. Furthermore, 
these were significantly elevated compared with levels in ATMs 
from obese mice (Figure 4A).
We confirmed gene expression data by examining protein lev-
els in the ATMs under study. Consistent with the RNA expression 
data, Ym1 was increased in SVF samples from lean compared with 
obese mice (Figure 4E). Additionally, purification of CD11b+ ATMs 
from SVF samples indicated that Ym1 is predominantly expressed 
in ATMs compared with non-macrophage CD11b– cells.
Another characteristic of the alternative macrophage activa-
tion state is increased arginase activity (15). Arginase activity was 
assessed in SVF and adipocyte samples from lean and obese mice. 
While the activity of this enzyme did not differ between the iso-
lated adipocytes from lean and obese mice, arginase activity was 
significantly diminished in the SVF fraction after HFD exposure 
(Figure 4F). This indicates that the arginase/iNOS balance in 
ATMs from lean animals is skewed toward an immunosuppres-
sive state that changes to a proinflammatory state with obesity 
(elevated iNOS and repressed arginase activity).
IL-10 protects adipocytes from the deleterious effects of TNF-α. The 
observation that the expression of Il10 is higher in the SVF and 
ATMs from lean compared with obese mice led us to examine the 
effects of the cytokine on adipocyte function. To explore the cellu-
lar effects of IL-10, we first examined the expression of its receptor. 
The IL-10 receptor α (IL-10Rα) was detected in adipose tissue by 
immunoblotting (Figure 5A). Separation of the SVF from adipo-
cytes in lean and obese animals indicated that the IL-10 receptor 
was expressed primarily in adipocytes, with minimal expression 
in the SVF (Figure 5B). No significant differences were seen in  
IL-10Rα expression between lean and obese mice.
We next examined IL-10 signaling in differentiated 3T3-L1 adi-
pocytes. STAT3 phosphorylation by the IL-10 receptor has been 
shown to be required for its antiinflammatory effects (24). Treat-
ment of adipocytes with IL-10 led to the tyrosine phosphorylation 
of STAT3 within 5 minutes. This effect peaked at 10 minutes and 
declined thereafter (Figure 5C). As IL-10 as been shown to activate 
the PI3K pathway via insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins (25), 
we examined phosphorylation of Akt in response to IL-10. IL-10 
treatment of adipocytes produced the rapid serine phosphoryla-
tion of Akt (Figure 5C).
IL-10 has a variety of antiinflammatory effects in macrophages 
and other cell types that includes the antagonism of the actions of 
TNF-α (26). To examine this in adipocytes, we first analyzed the 
effect of IL-10 on the secretion of the chemokine MCP-1, thought 
to be a major attractant for macrophages in states of obesity (9, 
11, 27). IL-10 treatment for 16 hours decreased MCP-1 secretion 
from adipocytes (Figure 6A). As reports suggest that IL-10 may 
mediate its antiinflammatory effects by antagonizing activation 
of NF-κB–mediated gene transcription (28), we examined the 
effects of IL-10 on TNF-α–stimulated NF-κB activity using an 
NF-κB–responsive luciferase reporter gene. While TNF-α induced 
reporter gene expression, IL-10 had no effect upon this activation 
(data not shown). This is consistent with other reports that show 
that IL-10 can alter the transcriptional rate of inflammatory genes 
independent of NF-κB activation (29).
We next examined the effects of IL-10 on insulin signal 
transduction in adipocytes in concert with TNF-α. Treatment 
of cells with TNF-α for 6 hours dramatically reduced the levels 
of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) protein, with a smaller reduc-
tion in the level of insulin receptor expression, similar to what has 
been reported previously (30). IL-10 pretreatment prevented the 
TNF-α–induced downregulation of both proteins (Figure 6B). 
Additionally, insulin-stimulated IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation 
was decreased with TNF-α treatment. This inhibitory effect was 
prevented by pretreatment with IL-10 (Figure 6C). IL-10 treat-
ment produced no significant changes in TNF-α–stimulated IRS1 
phosphorylation at Ser307, suggesting that the antagonism of  
TNF-α action by IL-10 occurs either downstream of or in parallel 
to reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1.
To determine whether IL-10 protects adipocytes from the physi-
ological effects of TNF-α, we examined insulin-stimulated glucose 
uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with and without IL-10 pretreatment. 
Treatment of cells with TNF-α for 3 hours produced a significant, 
30%–40% inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Pre-
treatment of the cells with IL-10 for 24 hours blocked these acute 
inhibitory effects of TNF-α (Figure 7A). Prolonged (72-hour), low-
dose TNF-α treatment increased basal glucose uptake but had no 
effect on insulin-stimulated levels, consistent with a dramatic 
upregulation of the glucose transporter GLUT1 under these con-
Figure 3

lated by FACS and total RNA isolated. Expression of Itgax (CD11c), 
Tnfa (TNF-α), Il6 (IL-6), Nos2 (iNOS), and Apoe (apoE) was analyzed 
by real-time RT-PCR in F4/80+CD11c+ (white bars) and F4/80+CD11c–

ditions (31). IL-10 blocked these effects of TNF-α and maintained 
cells in an insulin-sensitive state (Figure 7B). Moreover, insulin-
stimulated glucose uptake was dramatically enhanced in cells 
chronically treated with IL-10 compared with untreated cells.
Discussion
Recent data suggest that obesity may represent a state of chron-
ic, low-grade inflammation and that overnutrition is associated 
with the infiltration of adipose tissue by inflammatory cells (2). 
Although the precise cell types involved in this process remain 
uncertain, evidence is mounting that implicates ATMs as a sig-
nificant contributor to inflammation in obesity and a mediator 
of insulin resistance (3, 9, 32). Because the properties of ATMs are 
not well characterized, we performed a detailed examination of 
ATM subtypes and their gene expression in obese and lean mice. 
Based on the wide range of functions that macrophages display in 
normal and inflamed tissues (33), we hypothesized that ATMs are 
differentially activated depending on the degree of adiposity and, 
further, that in addition to quantitative differences, qualitative 
differences exist between ATMs in lean and obese animals.
We report here that ATMs isolated from white adipose tissue 
from lean animals express hallmarks of polarization toward an 
alternatively activated state (M2), suggesting a potentially ben-
eficial function of these cells. M2 polarization has been described 
in tumor-associated macrophages and parasitic infections and is 
believed to regulate tissue repair and prevent excess inflammation 
(15, 34). The markers of M2-polarized macrophages are still being 
described but include expression of the chitinase family member 
Ym1, the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10, arginase, and surface 
lectins Mgl1 and Mgl2 (15, 23). The genes encoding all of these pro-
teins were overexpressed in ATMs from lean compared with obese 
mice. Moreover, ATMs from obese CCR2KO mice, which display 
significantly lower inflammatory gene expression compared with 
their wild-type counterparts, express M2 markers at levels compa-
rable to those in lean mice. This observation is consistent with the 
evidence that resident tissue macrophages in normal conditions 
are derived from CCR2– monocytes, while macrophages recruited 
to sites of inflammation are derived from CCR2+ monocytes (20).
In the current paradigm of macrophage polarization, the prop-
erties of M2 macrophages contrast with the proinflammatory 
activities of classically activated M1 macrophages. One important 
difference between these polarization states involves the balance 
between arginase and iNOS activities. Arginase and iNOS both uti-
lize l-arginine as a substrate. However, while iNOS generates reac-
tive NO species with microbicidal and proinflammatory effects 
important in immune responses, arginase competes with iNOS for 
arginine as a substrate and generates l-ornithine, an important 
precursor for proline that enhances collagen biosynthesis (16).

Based both on gene expression analysis and direct measurement 
of activity, ATMs from lean mice exhibit enhanced arginase activ-
ity compared with obese mice. This balance in favor of arginase 
may play a critical role in repressing the generation of NO and 
other reactive oxygen species by iNOS and thus maintain adipo-
cyte function and promote tissue repair and remodeling.
The dramatic differences in IL-10 expression in lean compared 
with obese ATMs imply an important role for this cytokine as a 
homeostatic regulator in insulin sensitivity. Acute IL-10 infusion 
was shown to improve insulin sensitivity in whole animals (35), 
suggesting that this molecule may balance the effects of proin-
flammatory cytokines such as TNF-α. In humans, circulating IL-10  
levels correlate with markers of improved insulin sensitivity (36), 
and IL-10 levels increase along with insulin sensitivity after exer-
cise (37). Polymorphisms in the IL-10 promoter associated with low 
IL-10 expression are correlated with increased obesity and insulin 
resistance (38). Additionally, adiponectin has been shown to induce  
IL-10 expression in human leukocytes (39). Studies have also shown 
that in obese humans and rodents, both adipocyte and SVF com-
partments from adipose tissue are significant sources of IL-10 (40). 
As levels of proinflammatory cytokines are increased in obesity, 
this observation is consistent with the hypothesis that a balance 
exists between proinflammatory and antiinflamma-
tory factors that governs adipocyte function.
In vitro studies described here show that IL-10 
protects against TNF-α–dependent insulin resis-
tance in adipocytes. The mechanism underlying 
this effect remains uncertain. In macrophages,  
IL-10 attenuates TNF-α inflammatory signals via 
activation of STAT3 (24) and modulation of inflam-
matory gene transcription rates (29). We have not 
observed changes in TNF-α–stimulated NF-κB acti-
vation with IL-10 in adipocytes, although we did 
observe increased PI3K signaling with the cytokine. 
This observation agrees with previous reports that 
IL-10 can activate PI3K pathways via IRS (25) and 
suggests a possible mechanism by which IL-10 can 
antagonize the deleterious effects of TNF-α on 
insulin signaling in adipocytes.
Obesity leads to a shift in ATM phenotype exem-
plified by increased Tnfa and Nos2 expression, 
both characteristically activated in classically acti-
vated M1 macrophages (4–6). We have identified a 
unique subset of ATMs present only in obese animals that express 
F4/80+CD11b+CD11c+. These cells overexpress inflammatory 
genes compared with F4/80+CD11b+CD11c– ATMs and are the 
major ATM population that accumulates in fat with diet-induced 
obesity. These studies indicate a previously uncharacterized diver-
sity within the ATM population in obese mice that may have 
important functional consequences.
CD11c is a marker for DCs, which primarily function in 
phagocytosis, immune surveillance, and antigen presentation. 
F4/80+CD11c+ DCs have been termed interstitial dendritic cells; 
they were recently described in a kidney network that is believed 
to participate in immune surveillance (41). How these DCs par-
ticipate in inflammatory signals in adipose tissue is unknown. 
It is possible that DC activation is critical to the coordination of 
inflammatory events within fat tissue. An important role for DCs 
in obese adipose tissue is supported by the decreased expression of 
MHC class II genes in CCR2KO mice relative to controls (10). More-

over, we have observed an increased expression of MHC class II  
genes in ATMs specifically recruited to adipose tissue with HFD 
(42). These data suggest that DC-coordinated immunity may be 
crucial to the inflammatory events in adipose tissue that occur 
with obesity. Why such DCs are activated and what antigens they 
respond to is currently unknown.
Examining ATM infiltration into adipose tissue in the context 
of monocyte and macrophage heterogeneity leads us to propose 
a model for ATM biology that incorporates the diversity of these 
cells (Figure 8). In lean animals, resident macrophages are polar-
ized toward an M2 state (high IL-10 and arginase levels) derived 
from CCR2– monocytes that help maintain normal adipocyte 
function, perhaps by promoting tissue repair and angiogenesis in 
adipose tissue. Nutrient excess leads to adipocyte expansion, with 
increased secretion of monocyte chemoattractants that recruit 
inflammatory type CCR2+ monocytes to fat, where they differen-
tiate into M1-polarized activated macrophages and CD11c+ DCs. 
Alternatively activated M2 macrophages may be able to partially 
prevent the activation and accumulation of these classically acti-
vated M1 macrophages (43, 44), and the secretion of IL-10 helps 
protect adipocytes against the deleterious effects of TNF-α and 
related cytokines. However, with increasing adiposity, increased 
proinflammatory signals, continued recruitment of M1-polarized 
CCR2+ monocytes, and accumulation of CD11c+ ATMs all con-
tribute to overwhelm the protective effects of M2 macrophages, 
leading to a dominant role for M1-polarized, classically activated 
macrophages that generate high TNF-α, IL-6, and NO production. 
This model explains observations in obese CCR2KO and Mcp1/
Ccl2-KO mice that retain a population of ATMs with decreased 
inflammatory capacity (9, 10). We suspect that these KOs are 
deficient in the recruitment of CCR2+ monocytes during inflam-
mation in fat tissue, while the trafficking of CCR2– monocytes 
with M2 polarization remains intact. Studies aimed at determin-
ing whether enhancing M2 polarization in ATMs can block diet-
induced insulin resistance will be required in order to test this 
model. One limitation of the data leading to this model is that 
they are largely based on flow cytometric analysis of isolated SVF 
populations after collagenase digestion. This method of separa-
tion is an efficient one but may not fully capture all stromal cells 
from adipose tissue (5).
How diet-induced obesity leads to a change from M2 to M1 
polarization is currently unknown, but the mechanism is likely 
multifactorial. Our data suggest that the MCP-1/CCR2 axis con-
tributes to this polarization. We propose 2 potential models for 
this qualitative change in ATM activation: (a) Obesity may lead 
to an increase in the level of Ly-6ChiCCR2+ circulating monocytes 
that are primed for activation along an M1 polarization pattern. 
Factors such as MCP-1, TNF-α, and free fatty acids that activate 
TLR4 (45) may combine to influence this activation pattern as 
these monocytes enter adipose tissue. This model is supported 
by observations that obesity is associated with changes in acti-
vation state of circulating monocytes toward a more proinflam-
matory phenotype (46, 47). (b) Alternatively, obesity may change 
ATMs in adipose tissue from an M2 toward an M1 phenotype. 
Macrophages are reported to have the potential to switch from 
one polarization state to another depending upon environmental 
stimuli (48). However, this model depends upon a slow turnover 
of ATMs. Studies involving pulse labeling macrophages in vivo 
indicated that ATMs are largely replaced by 8 weeks in HFD-fed 
mice (42). Additionally, we have observed that the ATMs recruit-
ed to adipose tissue in HFD-fed mice overexpress Ccr2 and other 
proinflammatory mediators. These observations are consistent 
with the first hypothesis, according to which obesity leads to the 
recruitment of M1-polarized macrophages that gradually replace 
M2-polarized cells, which represents the default pathway of acti-
vation under lean conditions.
Our study frames ATM biology within the context of other 
known models of inflammation and macrophage recruitment. It 
may be possible to decrease inflammatory signals in adipose tis-
sue by modifying ATMs to retain an M2 polarization or by con-
verting M1 polarized macrophages to M2. Increasing IL-10 levels 
may represent one mechanism through which this could occur, 
since chronic IL-10 secretion can suppress classically activated M1 
macrophages (49). Future investigations will focus on identifying

IL-10 prevents the effects of TNF-α on blocking insulin-
stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes. (A) Pretreat-
ment of adipocytes with IL-10 blocks TNF-α effects on 
glucose uptake. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with 
IL-10 (20 ng/ml) for 24 hours prior to treatment with 
TNF-α (17 ng/ml) for 3 hours. 2-Deoxyglucose (2-DG) 
uptake was assessed after 30 minutes without (white 
bars) or with (black bars) insulin (100 nM) stimulation. 
Data are expressed as mean ± SD of triplicate experi-
ments repeated 3 times. *P < 0.05. (B) Insulin-stimulated 
glucose uptake in adipocytes chronically treated with  
IL-10 and TNF-α. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were 
treated with low-dose TNF-α (3 ng/ml) for 72 hours in 
the presence or absence of IL-10 (20 ng/ml). After insu-
lin stimulation (black bars), 2-DG uptake (upper panel) 
and fold change in glucose uptake (lower panel) were 
assessed, and the results demonstrated that IL-10 blocks 
the effects of TNF-α. Data are expressed as mean ± SD 
of triplicate experiments repeated 2 times. *P < 0.05.

factors that trigger the phenotypic switch of macrophage polariza-
tion in fat and whether these changes in polarization state are lim-
ited to fat or are generalizable to macrophages in other tissues.
Methods
Materials and reagents. For immunoblots, anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) and 
IRS1 antibodies were purchased from Upstate USA Inc. β-Actin monoclo-
nal antibody was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. GLUT4 antibodies were 
obtained from Alpha Diagnostics International. STAT3, phosphotyrosine-
STAT3, Akt, and phospho-Akt antibodies were purchased from Cell Signal-
ing Technology. Mouse recombinant TNF-α and IL-10 were obtained from 
Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-CD68, anti–IL-10 receptor α antibodies, and MCP-1  
ELISA kits were purchased from R&D Systems. Anti-F4/80 antibodies 
were from Abcam. Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated CD11b and unconjugated 
CD11c and CD11b antibodies were from AbD Serotec. PE-conjugated 
anti–Mac-3, PE/Cy5-conjugated anti-F4/80, APC-conjugated anti-CD11c, 
and isotype antibodies were purchased from eBioscience. Anti-Ym1 anti-
bodies were purchased from StemCell Technologies.
Animals and animal care. Male C57BL/6 mice were rendered insulin resis-
tant by feeding an HFD consisting of 45% of calories from fat (D12451; 
Research Diets Inc.) starting at 8 weeks of age for 20 weeks or indicated 
times. Control mice were fed a standard diet consisting of 4.5% fat (5002; 
LabDiet). ob/obJ mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. 
CCR2KO mice on a C57BL/6 background were kindly provided by S. Kun-
kel (University of Michigan). Animals were housed in a specific pathogen–
free facility with a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle and given free access 
to food and water. All animal use was in compliance with the Institute of 
Laboratory Animal Research Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory 
Animals and approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of 
Animals at the University of Michigan.
Cell culture. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were propagated and differentiated into 
adipocytes as described previously (50). Adipocytes were used in experi-
ments 8–10 days after differentiation. Adherent SVF cells were cultured on 
plastic or glass coverslips in DMEM supplemented with 10% endotoxin-
free FBS. For signaling experiments, the cells were starved overnight in 
0.5% serum media prior to stimulation with IL-10. For chronic treatment 
with IL-10 (20 ng/ml) and TNF-α (3 ng/mL), adipocyte media was replaced 
with fresh media every 24 hours.
SVF isolation and ATM purification. Epididymal fat pads from male 
C57BL/6 mice fed an ND or HFD were excised and minced in PBS with 
calcium chloride and 0.5% BSA. Tissue suspensions were centrifuged 
at 500 g for 5 minutes to remove erythrocytes and free leukocytes. Col-
lagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to 1 mg/ml and incubated at 37°C 
for 20 minutes with shaking. The cell suspension was filtered through a  
100-μm filter and then spun at 300 g for 5 minutes to separate floating 
adipocytes from the SVF pellet. To ensure proper isolation, adipocyte frac-
tions were examined by microscopy before and after plating on plastic to 
detect adherent cells. Samples were digested until adipocyte fractions were 
free of adherent cells by these 2 quality-control methods to ensure recovery 
of the majority of the SVF population.
For cell culture, the pellet containing the SVF cells was resuspended in 
growth media for further experiments. For flow cytometry, the SVF pellet 
was resuspended in 0.5 ml RBC Lysis Buffer (eBioscience) and incubated 
for 5 minutes prior to resuspension in sorting buffer (PBS with 0.5% endo-
toxin-free FBS, 2 mM EDTA, and 25 mM HEPES) at a concentration of 
107 cells/ml. Cells were incubated with Fc Block (BD Biosciences) prior to 
staining with conjugated antibodies for 15 minutes at 4°C followed by 2 
washes in 10× excess of sorting buffer. Cells were resuspended in sorting 
buffer supplemented with DAPI and then analyzed by FACS (FACSAria; BD 
Biosciences). Viable cells were sorted directly into RNA lysis buffer for RNA 
extraction. ATMs were identified by coexpression of F4/80 and CD11b.
Isolation of CD11b+ cells from SVF isolates was performed by magnetic 
immunoaffinity isolation with anti-CD11b antibodies conjugated to 
magnetic beads (MACS; Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were isolated using positive 
selection columns prior to preparation of whole-cell lysates.
Immunofluorescence staining. For immunofluorescence, SVF cells were plat-
ed onto glass coverslips for 2 hours, and nonadherent cells were removed by 
3 washes with PBS. After 24 hours, the cells were fixed by incubation with 
Figure 8
Proposed model for ATM polarization and its function in adipose tissue with progressive obesity. In lean, insulin-sensitive states, ATMs are polar-
ized toward an M2 state with IL-10 and arginase expression. Early during HFD treatment, adipocytes undergo hypertrophy, releasing chemokines 
that induce recruitment of M1-polarized ATMs with low IL-10 expression and increased iNOS and TNF-α production. In these early stages of mild 
obesity with retained insulin sensitivity, M2-polarized resident ATMs are able to partially protect adipocytes from these inflammatory factors and 
may block M1 polarization. With increased adiposity, recruited CCR2+ ATMs form crownlike structures (CLS) and overwhelm the protective effects 
of M2 macrophages, leading to a dominant role for TNF-α and iNOS. These factors generate insulin resistance in adipocytes, activate JNK and 
NF-κB, alter adipokine secretion, and lead to excess circulating levels of free fatty acids due to adipocyte lipolysis and impaired lipogenesis.

10% formalin for 20 minutes at room temperature. Cells were blocked in 
2% BSA in PBS and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking 
buffer. Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated 
at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. Coverslips were mounted on slides with 
VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories) and imaged on a confocal fluores-
cence microscope (Olympus FV300).
Real-time RT-PCR. RNA extraction was performed with an RNeasy kit 
(Qiagen). RT reactions were performed using standard methods (Strat-
agene) and real-time PCR analysis was performed using SYBR Green 
normalized to GAPDH (ABI Prism 7200 Sequence Detection System; 
Applied Biosystems). PCR primers used were: Apoe For, 5′-CTGACAG-

the comparative CT method correcting for amplification efficiency of the 
primers and performed in triplicate.
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates were prepared 
by the addition of lysis buffer (150 mM sodium chloride, 50 mM Tris 
pH 8, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 
10 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium 
orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors [complete Mini tablets; Roche 
Applied Science]). Cells were lysed at 4°C for 30 minutes and clarified by 
centrifugation. For immunoprecipitations, lysates were incubated with 
1 μg of anti-IRS1 antibodies overnight at 4°C and immune complexes 
precipitated with Protein A/G–conjugated beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnol-
ogy Inc.). Beads were washed with lysis buffer and resuspended in sample 
buffer. Lysates and immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, 
transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with primary antibod-
ies followed by species-specific HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. 
HRP activity was detected by chemiluminescence.
Immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded adipose tissue 
sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated prior to antigen unmasking 
by boiling in 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0, with 0.05% Tween-20 for 30 
minutes. Sections were blocked in normal serum and incubated with pri-
mary antibodies for durations of 1 hour to overnight. Endogenous HRP 
activity was quenched with incubation with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 
minutes. Secondary antibody staining was performed using the Vecta-
stain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) and detected with 3,3′-diaminoben-
zidine (DAB). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin prior to 
dehydration and coverslip placement.
2-Deoxyglucose uptake assay. Adipocytes were starved in low-glucose 
DMEM with 0.5% serum for 3 hours prior to insulin stimulation. 2-Deoxy-
glucose uptake assays were performed as previously described (51).
Arginase assay. Arginase activity assays were performed as previously 
described (52). Briefly, cells were lysed in 0.1% Triton X-100. Tris-HCl was 
added to 12.5-mM and MnCl2 added to 1-mM final concentration. Argi-
nase was activated by heating for 10 minutes at 56°C, and l-arginine sub-
strate was added to 250-mM final concentration. Reactions were incubated 
at 37°C for 30 minutes and stopped by the addition of H2SO4/H3PO4. 
After addition of α-isonitrosopropiophenone and heating for 30 minutes 
at 95°C, urea production was measured by absorbance at 540 nm and nor-
malized to total protein content.
NF-κB activation assay. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected with lucifer-
ase reporter plasmid pBIIX-luc (containing 2 tandemly repeated NF-κB 
binding sites) along with Renilla luciferase control (100:1; Promega) as 
previously described (51). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were 
treated with vehicle or TNF-α (1 nM) with or without IL-10 (20 ng/ml) for 
16 hours prior to lysis and analysis using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter 
Assay System (Promega). Values were normalized to Renilla activities.
Statistics. Results are presented as the mean ± 1 SD. Statistical analyses 
were conducted using an unpaired 2-tailed Student’s t test, with signifi-
cance set at a P value of less than 0.05.

Abstract
Introduction: In breast cancer, gene expression analyses have defined five tumor subtypes (luminal A, luminal B,
HER2-enriched, basal-like and claudin-low), each of which has unique biologic and prognostic features. Here, we
comprehensively characterize the recently identified claudin-low tumor subtype.
Methods: The clinical, pathological and biological features of claudin-low tumors were compared to the other
tumor subtypes using an updated human tumor database and multiple independent data sets. These main
features of claudin-low tumors were also evaluated in a panel of breast cancer cell lines and genetically
engineered mouse models.
Results: Claudin-low tumors are characterized by the low to absent expression of luminal differentiation markers,
high enrichment for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers, immune response genes and cancer stem cell-
like features. Clinically, the majority of claudin-low tumors are poor prognosis estrogen receptor (ER)-negative,
progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (triple negative)
invasive ductal carcinomas with a high frequency of metaplastic and medullary differentiation. They also have a
response rate to standard preoperative chemotherapy that is intermediate between that of basal-like and luminal
tumors. Interestingly, we show that a group of highly utilized breast cancer cell lines, and several genetically
engineered mouse models, express the claudin-low phenotype. Finally, we confirm that a prognostically relevant
differentiation hierarchy exists across all breast cancers in which the claudin-low subtype most closely resembles
the mammary epithelial stem cell.
Conclusions: These results should help to improve our understanding of the biologic heterogeneity of breast
cancer and provide tools for the further evaluation of the unique biology of claudin-low tumors and cell lines.
Introduction
Genomic studies have established four major breast can-
cer intrinsic subtypes (luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-
enriched, basal-like) and a normal breast-like group that
show significant differences in incidence, survival and
response to therapy [1-3]. However, as gene expression
studies evolve, further subclassification of breast tumors
into new molecular entities is expected to occur. In 2007,
we identified a new molecular subtype, referred to as
claudin-low, using 13 samples [5]. These distinct tumors
were found in both human and murine breast tumor data
sets and were characterized by the low gene expression of
tight junction proteins claudin 3, 4 and 7 and E-cadherin,
a calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion glycoprotein.
More recently, a tumor initiating cell (TIC) genomic sig-
nature derived from CD44+/CD24-/low-sorted cells and
mammospheres obtained from primary human breast
tumors was found to be exclusively enriched by gene
expression in the claudin-low subtype [6,7], and the
expression of this CD44+/CD24-/low/claudin-low profile
increased in posttreatment samples after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy or hormone therapy [7]. Overall, these
studies suggest that the claudin-low tumor subtype lacks
common epithelial cell features and is enriched for TIC
features.
In this study, we comprehensively characterize the
claudin-low subtype using an updated human tumor

the pathological and chemotherapy response characteris-
tics of this subtype of “triple negative” breast cancers. In
contrast to the basal-like subtype, we provide evidence
that claudin-low tumors are more enriched in epithelial-
to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) features, immune
system responses, and stem cell-associated biological
processes. The molecular characterization of the clau-
din-low intrinsic subtype in tumors and cell lines reveals
a breast cancer differentiation hierarchy that resembles
the normal epithelial mammary developmental cascade.
Materials and methods
Human breast tumor microarray data sets
All human tumor and normal tissue samples were col-
lected using Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved
protocols and were obtained from fresh frozen invasive
breast carcinomas that were profiled as described pre-
viously using oligo microarrays (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA, USA) [8]; we used all the microarrays
from Herschkowitz et al. [5], Parker et al. [9] and Hen-
nessy et al. [6], plus 39 new additional samples pre-
sented here. All microarray and patient clinical data are
available in the University of North Carolina (UNC)
Microarray Database [10] and have been deposited in
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the acces-
sion number GEO:GSE18229 (referred to here as the
UNC337 set). The probes or genes for all analyses were
filtered by requiring the lowest normalized intensity
values in both sample and control to be > 10. The nor-
malized log2 ratios (Cy5 sample/Cy3 control) of probes
mapping to the same gene (Entrez ID as defined by the
manufacturer) were averaged to generate independent
expression estimates. In the resulting UNC337 matrix,
no significant batch effects were observed. We also used
publicly available microarray and patient clinical data
from the following breast cancer data sets: NKI295
[11,12],
MDACC133
[13]
and
NKI113
[14].
In
MDACC133, raw data were normalized using the robust
multiarray analysis (RMA) normalization approach. In
all data sets, genes were median-centered within each
data set and samples were standardized to zero mean
and unit variance before other analyses were performed.
Gene expression signatures
We analyzed the mean expression of multiple previously
published gene signatures [7,15-19]. Briefly, these signa-
tures include leukocyte-related signatures from Palmer
et al. [17]: CD8 (n = 10 genes), B_Cell (n = 286), T_Cell
(n = 178), and GRANS (n = 353). Stromal-related signa-
tures were obtained from West et al. [16] (n = 402; DTF
and SFT signatures combined) and Beck et al. [19] (n =
174). Genes enriched more than twofold in mammo-
sphere-derived cells compared with differentiated cells
were obtained from Dontu et al. [15] (n = 58). From Shi-
pitsin et al. [18], we calculated the mean expression of
the upregulated (n = 357) and downregulated (n = 353)
genes from CD44+ versus CD24+ breast cancer cells from
metastatic pleural effusions. From Creighton et al. [7], we
calculated the mean expression of the CD44+/CD24-/low/
mammosphere signature reported (n = 119 upregulated
genes; n = 279 downregulated genes). Finally, the prolif-
eration and luminal gene cluster signatures were hand-
picked (node correlation > 0.75) from the unsupervised
intrinsic hierarchical clustering of the UNC337 using the
intrinsic list of Parker et al. [9] and average linkage clus-
tering using Cluster v2.12 (M. Eisen) [20] as shown in
Figure S1 in Additional file 1. Gene lists from all genomic
signatures are displayed in Supplemental Data in Addi-
tional file 2.
Breast cancer cell line microarray data set
We analyzed a data set that included Affymetrix U133A
gene expression microarrays of 52 breast cancer cell lines
[21]. Raw data were normalized using RMA, and genes
were median-centered before analyses. Among the 52
breast cancer cell lines analyzed, DU4475, HCC1008 and
HCC1599 cell lines were not included in Neve et al. [21].
Mouse breast tumor microarray data set
All mouse samples from the UNC were collected from
fresh frozen invasive breast carcinomas as described pre-
viously [5] using Agilent mouse oligo microarrays. Data
normalization and preprocessing were identical to that
described for the UNC337 data set. We used only sam-
ples (n = 104) from our previous publication that were
included in 1 of the 10 mouse classes [5].
Claudin-low and normal breast Euclidian centroid-based
predictors
To robustly identify claudin-low samples, we built two
predictors on the basis of either our human tumor data
or the cell line data of Neve et al. [21]. To build a predic-
tor, we first selected those genes that were significantly
differentially expressed between claudin-low tumors
defined by SigClust [22] (or cell lines) and all other sub-
types using a two-class, unpaired SAM, with < 5% false
discovery rate (FDR). Then we used these gene lists and
calculated a claudin-low centroid and an “others” cen-
troid from the training data. For every sample, we calcu-
lated the Euclidean distances to the two centroids and
assigned the class of the nearest centroid. Using the same
methodology, we also built a normal breast predictor by
selecting those genes that were significantly differentially
expressed between normal breast tissues and breast
tumors using a two-class, unpaired SAM, with 0% FDR.
Note that these gene lists are also included in Supple-
mental Data in Additional file 2.

Intrinsic subtype classification
For all human breast tumor studies, intrinsic subtype
classification was performed using the PAM50 predictor
[9]. Human claudin-low tumor samples were identified
using either SigClust [22] or the nine-cell line claudin-
low predictor. Samples identified by SigClust [22] or the
nine-cell line claudin-low predictor were called claudin-
low, regardless of the PAM50 call. For breast cancer cell
lines, the claudin-low subtype classification was based
on unsupervised hierarchical clustering using the intrin-
sic list of Parker et al. [9] and the node identified in
Figure S4 in Additional file 1. The complete gene list of
the nine-cell line claudin-low predictor can be found in
Supplemental Data in Additional file 2.
Mammary developmental analyses
Public data sets from Raouf et al. [23] and Lim et al. [24]
were downloaded from GEO and assigned NCBI Entrez
gene identifiers as available in GEO. Samples were scaled
to mean zero and variance of 1. Features were then col-
lapsed to the mean of each gene identifiers. In Lim et al.
[24], three epithelial cell-enriched subpopulations were
profiled on DNA microarrays: mammary stem cells
(MaSC), luminal progenitors (pL) and mature luminal
cells (mL). We created a differentiation predictor for
each sample as a measure of any sample’s position along
a MaSC ® pL ® mL axis as defined by gene expression.
Distance-weighted discrimination (DWD) was used to
determine the direction of greatest variation from MaSC
to pL and pL to mL. To map a sample onto this axis of
differentiation, the pL centroid was set as the origin, and
the MaSC and mL centroids were transformed to length
1 (sum of squares equals 1) to map a sample onto this
axis of differentiation. Before mapping a sample onto this
axis, it is assumed that the test data set covers the range
of differentiation, which allows median centering of
genes to correct for platform bias. Test samples are then
adjusted using the parameters for placing pL at the origin
and are transformed to length 1. Each sample is then
projected onto the MaSC ® pL axis and the pL ® mL
axis by calculating the inner product of the sample and
the MaSC or mL vectors identified by DWD. The differ-
ence of the two projected positions of each sample along
the MaSC ® pL ® mL axis is referred to as the differen-
tiation score. In the UNC microarray database web site
[10], we have provided the detailed R commands and
files regarding the differentiation predictor.
Mammospheres from normal breast tissues
Fourteen normal breast tissues were dissociated mechani-
cally and enzymatically as described in Stingl et al. [25].
The samples were procured and used according to
approved IRB protocols for research in human subjects.
Mammospheres were cultured according to Dontu et al.
[15], and single cells were plated onto ultralow attachment
plates (Corning) at a density of 20,000 viable cells/ml.
RNA was purified using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) after 14
to 20 days in primary culture (first passage), and microar-
rays were performed as described above.
Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections
(~5 μm thick) were processed using standard immuno-
histochemistry methods as previously described [26].
The sections were incubated for 60 min at room tem-
perature with primary antibody to claudin 3 (dilution
1:100; Invitrogen, Catalog No. 18-7340) or E-cadherin
(Clone No. ECH-6, pre-diluted; Cell Marque). The slides
were incubated for 45 min with diluted biotinylated sec-
ondary antibody (1:250 dilution) for 30 min with Vectas-
tain Elite ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories). Sections
were incubated in peroxidase substrate solution for
visualization. Slides were counterstained with hematoxy-
lin and examined by light microscopy. Tumor immunor-
eactivity was scored in a blinded fashion by two
investigators (JIH and XH) into two categories: negative/
weak positive and moderate/strong positive.
Immunofluorescence
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections (~5 μm
thick) were processed using standard immunostaining
methods as previously described [5]. The primary anti-
bodies and their dilution were vimentin (mouse anti-
vimentin IgG1-, dilution 1:100; Invitrogen, Catalog No.
18-0052), keratin 5 (rabbit anti-human, dilution 1:500;
Abcam, Catalog No. ab24647), and keratin 19 (Abcam,
Catalog No. ab7754, mouse anti-human IgG2a; dilution
1:200). Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence
were conjugated with Alexa Fluor-568 (Red, keratin 5
and 19) or Alexa Fluor-488 (Green, vimentin) fluoro-
phores (1:200; Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Dual posi-
tivity was scored in a blinded fashion by XH into two
categories: negative meaning no dual positive cells and
positive meaning the presence of dual positive cells.
Cell lines
SUM159PT cells (Asterand) were maintained in Ham’s
F-12 medium with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), insulin
(5 μg/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 μg/ml). MCF-7 was
cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS [27], and SUM149PT
was maintained in HuMEC media with supplements
(Gibco) with and without 5% FBS [28]. All cell lines
were grown at 37°C and 5% carbon dioxide.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and
microarray analysis
Nonconfluent cell cultures were trypsinized and filtered
to produce single cell suspension, counted, washed with

Hanks’ balanced salt solution (Stem Cell Technologies)
containing 2% FBS and stained with antibodies specific
for human cell surface markers: EPCAM-fluorescein iso-
thiocyanate (Stem Cell Technologies) and CD49f-
phycoerythrin (BD Pharmingen). A total of 500,000 cells
were incubated with antibodies for 30 min at 4°C. Cells
were washed from unbound antibodies and immediately
analyzed using Beckman-Coulter (Dako) CyAn ADP or
sorted using BD FACScan. RNA was purified from
sorted cells using the RNeasy Mini kit, and microarrays
were performed as described above.
Statistical analyses
All microarray cluster analyses were displayed using Java
Treeview version 1.1.3. Average linkage hierarchical
clustering was performed using Cluster v2.12 [20]. Bio-
logic analysis of microarray data was performed with the
DAVID annotation tool [29]. ANOVA and Student’s
t-tests for gene expression data, Fisher’s exact test for
neoadjuvant clinical data, c2 tests for pathological data,
and the Cox model were performed using R [30]. Survi-
val curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method
and compared by the log-rank test using WinStat
v2007.1. Reported P values are two-sided.
Results
Molecular characterization of the claudin-low breast
tumor subtype
To identify the molecular characteristics of claudin-low
tumors, we created a large genomic data set by com-
bining three of our previously published data sets
[5,6,9] and included 37 new tumor samples (n = 337;
UNC337, GEO series GSE18229). Hierarchical cluster-
ing analysis of this data set using the ~1,900 intrinsic
gene list of Parker et al. [9] identified the major intrin-
sic molecular subtypes, including the claudin-low sub-
type (Figure S1 in Additional file 1). The validity of
the claudin-low sample cluster was confirmed by par-
sing the dendogram with SigClust [22] (P < 0.001);
notably, this clustering analysis placed the claudin-low
tumors in close proximity to the basal-like subtype and
was composed of 32 arrays, representing 32 patients
(~12% of all patients). Compared to the luminal A,
luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like subtypes,
claudin-low tumors showed inconsistent expression of
basal keratins (keratins 5, 14 and 17) and low expres-
sion of HER2 and luminal markers such as ER, PR,
GATA3, keratins 18 and 19 and the luminal gene clus-
ter (Figure 1a). Despite the apparent similarity to
basal-like tumors, claudin-low tumors as a group did
not show high expression of proliferation genes and
thus are likely slower-cycling tumors. Indeed, signifi-
cantly lower messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of
the cell cycle gene Ki67 was observed in claudin-low
tumors when compared with basal-like tumors (P <
0.0001, Student’s t-test; Figure S2 and Table S1 in
Additional file 1).
To better characterize the claudin-low molecular sub-
type, we identified those genes differentially expressed in
claudin-low tumors compared with other tumors or
subtypes. We found 1,308 and 359 genes significantly
higher and lower in expression in claudin-low tumors,
respectively (Table S2 in Additional file 1). Overall, clau-
din-low tumors highly expressed genes involved in
immune system response (i.e. CD79b, CD14 and vav1),
cell communication (chemokine [C-X-C motif] ligand
12), extracellular matrix (vimentin, fibroblast growth
factor 7), cell differentiation (Krüppel-like factor 2,
interleukin 6), cell migration (integrin a5, moesin) and
angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor C,
matrix metallopeptidase 9) [29]. Conversely, expression
of various epithelial cell-cell adhesion genes such as
claudin 3, claudin 4, claudin 7, occludin and E-cadherin
was significantly lower as previously reported [5] (Figure
1b). Further immunohistochemical analysis of 103 breast
tumors of the UNC337 data set revealed that compared
to the basal-like subtype, the claudin-low tumor subtype
had a preponderance for low to absent expression of
E-cadherin and claudin 3 (45% vs. 11% for E-cadherin,
P < 0.05; 59% vs. 11% for claudin 3, P < 0.005; c2 test).
Similarly, when compared to all other tumors (basal-
like, HER2-enriched, luminal A, luminal B and normal
breast-like) as a single group, the claudin-low tumor
subtype maintained its characteristic for low to absent
expression of E-cadherin and claudin 3 (45% vs. 15% for
E-cadherin, P < 0.005; 59% vs. 22% for claudin 3, P <
0.001; c2 test) (Figure S3 in Additional file 1).
Concordant with the expression of markers of
mesenchyme and immunity, we observed high expres-
sion of stromal-specific and lymphocyte- or granulocyte-
specific gene signatures in claudin-low tumors compared
to the other intrinsic subtypes [16,17,19] (Figure 1b,
Figure S2 in Additional file 1). These findings, together
with the low expression of epithelial cell-cell adhesion
molecules such as E-cadherin, are consistent with an
EMT (changes in cell phenotype between epithelial and
mesenchymal states) [31] in claudin-low tumors and a
potential recruitment of multiple types of leukocytes
into these tumors.
We next explored the mRNA expression of the TIC
gene markers CD44 and CD24 and cell surface markers
of epithelial differentiation such as MUC1, CD49f, and
epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) across the
intrinsic subtypes (basal-like, claudin-low, luminal A,
luminal B, HER2-enriched) and the normal breast-like
group to determine their differentiation status. Overall,
claudin-low tumors showed low mRNA expression of
differentiated luminal cell surface markers (CD24,
Prat et al. Breast Cancer Research 2010, 12:R68

EpCAM and MUC1), while markers CD44 and CD49f
were higher when compared to differentiated luminal
tumors (P < 0.05, Student’s t-test; Figure 1c, Figure S2
in Additional file 1). The expression pattern of these
gene markers is concordant with CD44+/CD24-/low and
CD49f+/EpCAM-/low antigenic phenotypes, which have
been previously shown to be enriched in breast TICs
[32,33] and mammary stem cells (MaSCs) [24]. Second,
we observed that claudin-low tumors compared to the
other tumor subtypes, except for the normal breast-like
group, showed the highest mRNA expression of
ALDH1A1, which has recently been proposed to be
another marker of breast stem cells and TICs [34] but
also noted in stromal cells [24,34,35]. Conversely, basal-
like tumors did not show significantly lower expression
of CD24 as a group, nor did they show high mRNA
expression of ALDH1A1 (Figure 1b and Figure S2 in
Additional file 1). This contrasts with other studies that
have linked the basal-like subtype with stem cell- or
embryonic cell-like features [36,37]; however, these

other studies did not examine claudin-low tumors as a
separate group, and in the absence of a claudin-low pre-
dictor, claudin-low tumors are typically classified as
basal-like (or normal breast-like) by the PAM50 gene
expression assay [9].
To further explore the potential enrichment for breast
stem cells and TIC features, we evaluated the expression
of three breast stem cell-like signatures [7,15,18] across
the different subtypes. All signatures were highly
enriched (P < 0.0001, Student’s t-test; Supplementary
Material in Additional file 2) in the claudin-low subtype
despite the various derivations used of each signature
(Figure 1c, Figure S2 in Additional file 1). Interestingly,
these three stem cell-like signatures were representative
of distinct gene expression subsets, among which < 10%
of the genes overlapped. These data suggest that differ-
ent biological processes associated with TICs converge
in the claudin-low tumor subtype.
Identification of the claudin-low profile in a panel of
breast cancer cell lines
To investigate if potential in vitro counterparts for these
tumors exist, we analyzed a data set of 52 breast cancer
cell lines [21] by hierarchical cluster analysis using our
most recent human breast tumor intrinsic classification
list [9]. The three major subgroups (luminal, basal B
and basal A) identified previously by Neve et al. [21]
were evident, with nine basal B cell lines clustering
together with a node correlation of 0.59 (Figure S4 in
Additional file 1). These cell lines showed low expres-
sion of the ER, HER2 and claudin 3, claudin 4 and clau-
din 7 (Figure S4 in Additional file 1). We identified
those genes whose expression distinguished each human
tumor subtype using significance analysis of microarrays
(SAM) in our UNC337 tumor database, including a list
defining the normal breast-like group (Figure 2a). These
nine cell lines (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-436, Hs578T,
BT549, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, SUM1315MO2,
SUM159PT and HBL100) showed a gene expression
pattern similar to the claudin-low tumor subtype with
the lowest expression of genes involved in epithelial
cell-cell adhesion (i.e., E-cadherin and claudins 3, 4 and
7), luminal differentiation (i.e., CD24, EpCAM) and high
values for the CD44/CD24 and CD49f/EpCAM mRNA
ratios (Figure S4, Table S3 in Additional file 1). To com-
plement these clustering analyses, we developed a clau-
din-low centroid-based predictor using the UNC337
tumor data set and the SigClust-defined claudin-low
group versus all others, and objectively classified the 52
cell lines as claudin-low or not; as expected, the human

tumor-based claudin-low predictor identified these nine
cell lines as claudin-low (Figure S5 in Additional file 1).
The gene cluster that identifies the in vivo defined
normal
breast-like
group
was
not
differentially
expressed by any of the 52 cell lines, suggesting overall
that none of these cell lines show a normal breast-like
phenotype (Figure 2b). The normal breast-like group of
primary specimens is usually composed of actual nor-
mal breast samples and a small number of primary
tumors [9,38], the latter of which we believe show the
high expression of true normal tissue genes due to sig-
nificant normal breast contamination [9]. In cell culture,
however, there is no such contamination by normal
epithelial or nonepithelial cells, and thus this lack of
contamination may explain why normal breast-like
tumor cell lines are not identified as such by the clus-
tering. To be more objective, we applied a normal
breast centroid-based predictor (normal breast versus all
tumors using the UNC337 database) to the cell line
data, and no cell line was classified as normal breast
(Figure S5 in Additional file 1). Contamination with
other tissues or cells is not uncommon in other tumor
subtypes [1]. For example, within the top highly
expressed genes in claudin-low tumors versus all others,
there are several wound response-related genes (i.e.,
CD28, CD52) that are not expressed by the breast can-
cer cell lines (Figure 2b), potentially due to significant
immune or stromal cell content in the tumor. Overall,
these data suggest that the nine previously described
breast cancer cell lines are most similar to claudin-low
tumors in in vivo specimens.
Building a Cell-line claudin-low centroid-based predictor
Because primary human claudin-low tumors are highly
enriched for immune system genes (and lymphocytes)
when supervised analyses are performed, the expression
of nonepithelial cell genes would likely increase the false
positivity of the human claudin-low predictor when
applied to other tumor data sets, because, for instance,
tumors would be called claudin-low or not based upon
the high expression of immune cell genes. Therefore, we
developed a claudin-low centroid-based predictor using
the cell line database of Neve et al. [21]. First, we evalu-
ated its accuracy by applying the predictor onto our
human tumor database (UNC337). The nine-cell line
claudin-low predictor identified 37 samples (~11%) as
claudin-low, including the 28 claudin-low samples pre-
viously identified by hierarchical clustering. The remain-
ing nine samples identified by the predictor were
previously called basal-like (n = 7), normal breast-like (n
= 1) and HER2-enriched (n = 1) by the PAM50 predic-
tor [9]. Overall, the nine-cell line claudin-low predictor
showed 87.5% sensitivity, 97.0% specificity, and 75.7%
and 98.7% positive and negative predictive values,
respectively, if the SigClust-defined claudin-low group is
considered the gold standard.
We then used the nine-cell line claudin-low predic-
tor to identify this subtype in a mouse tumor database
[5], which represents 13 different mouse models
grouped in 10 different classes on the basis of their
gene expression profiles (Groups I to X). Interestingly,
all claudin-low samples identified by the centroid pre-
dictor (n = 9) were included in Group II, which we
previously highlighted for its mesenchymal features
(i.e., spindle-shaped cells). These nine murine claudin-
low tumor samples were derived from six different
mouse models (Brca1Co/Co;TgMMTV-Cre;p53+/-,
DMBA-induced,
p53-/-
transplant,
p53+/-
IR,
TgMMTV-Neu and TgWAP-T121) and overall showed
similar enrichment for EMT markers and human
mesenchymal and stem cell-like signatures, including
decreased expression of proliferative- and luminal-
associated genes (Figure S6 in Additional file 1). No
murine normal mammary tissue sample was classified
as claudin-low. These analyses suggest that a cell line
centroid-based approach, by focusing on genes
expressed in epithelial cells only, might give more
accurate classification of tumors, which could be evalu-
ated in future studies focused on tumor subtyping.
Clinical-pathological characteristics of claudin-low
breast tumors
To determine for the first time the clinical-pathological
characteristics of human claudin-low breast tumors, we
evaluated our breast cancer patient database (UNC337)
and two independent gene expression data sets (NKI295
and MDACC133) [11-13] using the nine-cell line clau-
din-low predictor and the previously published PAM50
subtype predictor (Figure 3a) because these two objec-
tive centroid predictors have been demonstrated to be
the most robust to classify breast tumors into discrete
subtypes. Across all three databases, claudin-low tumors
showed a prevalence of 7 to 14%, and were mostly ER-/
PR-/HER2- (also known as triple-negative tumors, 61 to
71%). Conversely, the majority of triple-negative tumors
were either basal-like (39 to 54%) or claudin-low (25 to
39%), followed by HER2-enriched (7 to 14%), luminal B
(4 to 7%), luminal A (4 to 5%) and normal breast-like
(1%). In terms of prognosis, Kaplan-Meier survival ana-
lysis revealed that claudin-low tumors have a worse
prognosis compared to luminal A tumors in both the
UNC337 (hazard ratio [HR] of 2.83 and 5.66 for
relapse-free survival [RFS] and overall survival [OS],
respectively; P < 0.05) and NKI295 data sets (HR of 4.71
and 17.98 for RFS and OS, respectively; P < 0.001). Con-
versely, similar survival curves were observed between
claudin-low tumors and the other poor prognosis sub-
types such as luminal B, HER2-enriched and basal-like

tumors (Figure 3b). Normal breast-like samples were
omitted from survival analyses because they are likely
significantly contaminated by normal breast tissue, and
thus their true tumor biology is masked.
We also evaluated the potential association between
claudin-low tumors and treatment response by using the
MDACC breast cancer patient data set (133 pretreated
samples) of tumors treated with neoadjuvant anthracy-
cline/taxane-based chemotherapy [13]. Notably, claudin-
low tumors showed a lower pathological complete
response (pCR) rate after anthracycline/taxane-based
chemotherapy compared to basal-like tumors (38.9% vs.
73.3% pCR rates; P = 0.08, Fisher’s exact test), but their
pCR rate was higher than luminal A or B tumors;
interestingly, the apparent pCR rate of the basal-like
tumors increased from 59% (reported in Parker et al. [9])
to ~73% when the claudin-low subtype was included,
because among 18 claudin-low tumors identified in this
set, 12 (67%) of 18 of them were previously identified as
basal-like and the response rate of this subgroup of
patients was 41.7%. These findings suggest that claudin-
low tumors show some chemotherapy sensitivity but
overall have a poor prognosis and may not be managed
effectively with existing chemotherapy regimens.
Twenty-one claudin-low samples were examined his-
tologically by a pathologist (CL; Table S4 in Additional
file 1) to further clinically characterize claudin-low
tumors. Among the samples evaluated, 9 (43%) of 21

had noteworthy histological differentiation patterns,
including medullary-like features (5/21, 24%) such as
pushing margins and brisk tumor lymphocytic infiltra-
tion, two samples (2 of 21, 10%) showed metaplastic dif-
ferentiation, one sample showed mixed ductal/lobular
features, and one sample was a pure micropapillary car-
cinoma. The remaining 12 samples (12 of 21, 57%) were
invasive ductal carcinomas not otherwise specified.
Overall, lymphoid infiltration was evident in a total of
seven samples (total of 7 of 19, 37%), which might
explain the high mRNA expression of immune response
genes present in these tumors. Among the other clau-
din-low samples that could not be examined histologi-
cally (n = 16), 50% (8/16) had a previous diagnosis of
metaplastic tumors. It is interesting to note that two
claudin-low cell lines, Hs578T and MDA-MB-157, were
derived from metaplastic [39] and medullary [40]
carcinomas.
Since the pathological examination of claudin-low
tumors identified special histological features, we applied
the nine-cell line claudin-low predictor to a publicly
available database of histologically diverse subtypes of
breast cancer (n = 113, NKI113) [14], which includes 10
medullary carcinomas, 20 metaplastic carcinomas and
22 invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC). Indeed, 8 (57%) of
14 and 2 (14%) of 14 claudin-low samples were identi-
fied as metaplastic and medullary carcinomas, respec-
tively (Figure 4f and Table S5 in Additional file 1).
Conversely, only 2 of a total of 22 ILCs were identified
as claudin-low despite the lack of E-cadherin expression
in lobular tumors [41].
Claudin-low subtype resembles the MaSC profile
We hypothesized, as did Lim et al. [24], that a mam-
mary differentiation program starting from a MaSC ®
luminal progenitor (pL) ® mature luminal cells (mLs)
exists, and therefore we built a differentiation model
using data from Lim et al. [24]. For this predictor,
higher scores represent greater differentiation status
along this axis that culminates in ER+ mLs (Figure 4a).
First, we applied this predictor onto similar subpopula-
tions of purified human mammary epithelial cells that
were separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) and profiled as part of the independent study
of Raouf et al. [23] using different surface makers (Fig-
ure S7 in Additional file 1). The differentiation predic-
tor showed 100% (8 of 8) accuracy with the bipotent
progenitor subpopulation from Raouf et al. [23]

[CD49f+(MUC1/CD133)-(CD10/THY1)+] showing the
lowest differentiation score (and thus most similar to
the MaSC fraction of Lim et al. [24]), followed by the
luminal-restricted progenitor [CD49f+(MUC1/CD133)
+(CD10/THY1)-] and then the mLs [CD49f-(MUC1/
CD133)+(CD10/THY1)-]. In addition, we established
and
expression-profiled
mammosphere
cultures
obtained from 14 different normal breast tissues
because these cultures enrich for cells with stem or
self-renewal capacity [15]. As expected, mammospheres
showed a low differentiation score close to the MaSC
profile (Figure 4b).
Notably, and as shown by Lim et al. [24], the breast
cancer subtypes segregate along the normal mammary
epithelial differentiation hierarchy starting with undif-
ferentiated claudin-low tumors, followed by basal-like,
then HER2-enriched tumors, and finally both luminal
tumor subtypes (Figure 4c). As expected, we observed
the same pattern using the breast cancer cell line data
[21] (Figure 4d). Conversely, the nine-cell line claudin-
low predictor identified the MaSC and stromal
(CD49flow/EpCAM-) subpopulations of Lim et al. [24]
as claudin-low, and as expected, both subpopulations
showed the highest and lowest expression of the up-
and downregulated genes that define the nine-cell line
claudin-low predictor (Figure S8 in Additional file 1).
Moreover, we applied the differentiation predictor to
the mouse data set of Herschkowitz et al. [5] (Figure
4e) and observed that the previously identified claudin-
low murine samples scored the lowest, while the
MMTV-Neu and MMTV-PyMT models, which are
known luminal mammary adenocarcinoma models,
scored the highest. In addition, among 113 histological
special types of breast cancer [14], medullary, adenoid
cystic and metaplastic tumors showed the lowest score
in the differentiation axis (Figure 4f), which is consis-
tent with our previous reports of commonalities
between metaplastic carcinomas, claudin-low tumors
and breast cancer TICs [6].
Finally, we evaluated the prognostic ability of the
differentiation predictor in the UNC337 and NKI295
breast cancer patient data sets. Low differentiation
scores were statistically significantly associated with
poorer RFS and OS in univariate (Figure 5a) and mul-
tivariate analyses after adjusting for the main clinical-
pathological parameters (i.e., size, grade, node and ER
status), including tumor subtype (Figure 5b). These
data suggest that tumors with an undifferentiated
phenotype similar to the normal MaSC and/or early
progenitors have a poorer prognosis compared to
tumors with a more mature luminal phenotype, and
this association is independent of the luminal B and
HER2-enriched subtypes and the common clinical
variables.
Claudin-low and basal-like tumors are enriched with
undifferentiated or mesenchymal cells
Next, we sought to determine whether tumor cells with
undifferentiated or mesenchymal features (as defined by
immunofluorescence) exist within the different breast
cancer intrinsic subtypes, similar to that performed by
Creighton et al. [7]. Eighty-six breast tumors and one
normal breast sample from the UNC337 database,
including 20 claudin-low tumors, were evaluated using
dual immunofluorescence (IF) staining with epithelial
(keratin 5/19) and mesenchymal (vimentin) markers.
Staining of the normal breast sample revealed that the
antibody to vimentin stains the mesenchyme or stroma,
whereas the antibody to keratin 5/19 stains the ducts,
and no dual positive cells were seen (Figure 6). Conver-
sely, 33% (28 of 86) of all tumor samples showed some
degree of dual positivity, but 89% (25 of 28) of all sam-
ples with dual immunofluorescence positivity were
either claudin-low (n = 11) or basal-like (n = 14). The
remaining dual positive samples were identified in the
HER2-enriched (n = 1) and luminal A subtypes (n = 2).
Claudin-low tumors showed higher percentages of dual
positive tumors than the other tumor subtypes when
these are considered as a group (55% vs. 26%; P = 0.014,
c2 test); however, no statistically significant differences
in dual positivity were observed between claudin-low
and basal-like tumors (55% vs. 78%; P = 0.14, c2 test).
These data show that some epithelial tumor cells
express mesenchymal features, these features are not
due to contamination by adjacent stromal cells and
almost all tumors with these features are basal-like or
claudin-low tumors.
We attempted to identify undifferentiated/mesenchy-
mal epithelial cells within breast cancer cell lines. First,
we analyzed the expression of surface markers CD49f
and EpCAM (chosen based upon the studies of Lim et
al. [24]) in three different cell lines: MCF-7 (luminal),
SUM149PT (basal-like) and SUM159PT (claudin-low)
(Figure 7). As expected on the basis of our previous
genomic analysis of the differentiation status of these
cell lines, virtually all claudin-low SUM159PT cells
showed a stromal or MaSC antigenic phenotype (CD49f
+/EpCAM-), ~98% of MCF-7 cells showed a mL pheno-
type (CD49f-/low/EpCAM+), and ~83% of SUM149PT
cells showed a pL phenotype (CD49f+/EpCAM+/high).
About 10% and ~2% of cells from SUM149PT and
MCF-7 cell lines, respectively, showed low expression of
EpCAM, suggesting that some cells within basal-like
and luminal cell lines might have a more undifferen-
tiated state. However, a clear EpCAM-/low subpopulation
was identified only in the SUM149PT cell line.
To further determine the differentiation status of the
various cell subpopulations within MCF-7 (CD49f-/
EpCAM+, CD49f+/EpCAM+, and CD49f-/lowEpCAM-/low),

low) and SUM159PT (CD49f-/low/EpCAM- and CD49f
+/high/EpCAM-), we sorted and profiled these seven subpo-
pulations using gene expression microarrays. The
EpCAM-/low cells derived from MCF-7 or SUM149PT
lines showed a statistically significant undifferentiated
state when compared with their EpCAM+/high cell counter-
parts (Figure 7b); however, for MCF-7 cells, the EpCAM-/
low cells still showed high differentiation scores. Conver-
sely, the CD49f+/EpCAM-/low cells from the basal-like
SUM149PT cell line showed the presence of a mesenchy-
mal/claudin-low-like gene expression profile, with

high expression of genes involved in wound response (i.e.,
interleukin 6, chemokine [C-X-C motif], ligand 1),
angiogenesis (i.e., VEGFA) and extracellular matrix (i.e.,
vimentin, SNAI1), while genes involved in luminal differ-
entiation (i.e., keratin 19, CD24) and cell-cell adhesion
such as E-cadherin or claudin 7 were low (Figure 7c and
Supplemental Data in Additional file 2). Since both clau-
din-low (CD49f+/EpCAM-/low) and basal-like (CD49f+/high/
EpCAM+) cells exist within the SUM149PT cell line, we
wished to determine whether one cell type gave rise to the
other. When sorted and plated separately, 5 to 10% of the
CD49f+/EpCAM-/low SUM149PT cells differentiated
into CD49f+/high/EpCAM+ basal-like cells, whereas the
CD49f+/high/EpCAM+ basal-like cells maintained their dif-
ferentiated status during in vitro culture (Figure 7d).
Discussion
Here, claudin-low tumors were comprehensively charac-
terized, and many important biological and clinical fea-
tures were identified. Specifically, we addressed four
topics for claudin-low tumors including (1) molecular
features, (2) clinical and histological characteristics, (3)
relation to established breast cancer cell lines and
genetically engineered mouse models and (4) differentia-
tion status based on analyses of purified normal mam-
mary epithelial cell subpopulations.
Molecular characterization of the claudin-low sub-
type reveals that these tumors are significantly enriched
in EMT and stem cell-like features while showing a low
expression of luminal and proliferation-associated
genes. Among these molecular characteristics, EMT
and stem cell features have recently been linked to one
another [18,33,42,43]. Indeed, expression of EMT-indu-
cing transcription factors SNAI1 [33] or TWIST1 [33]
or repression of E-cadherin [43] in mammary epithelial
cells increases the number of stem cells, and these and
other EMT-inducing transcription factors such as
ZEB2 and TWIST2, as well as the mesenchymal
marker vimentin, are expressed at higher levels in
CD44+CD24-/low stem cell-like cells than in more dif-
ferentiated epithelial CD44-CD24+ cells [18,33]. Consis-
tent with this finding, we observed a high mRNA
expression of known transcriptional repressors of E-
cadherin such as SNAI1, SNAI2, TWIST1, TWIST2,
ZEB1 and ZEB2, and other EMT-inducing factors such
as hypoxia-inducible factor-1a in claudin-low tumors
[31] (Figure 1b, Figure S2 in Additional file 1). Thus,
our data suggest that claudin-low tumors, compared
with the other intrinsic breast tumor subtypes, are the
most enriched for stem cell and/or TIC features, and
on the basis of our vimentin immunofluorescence
staining, it appears that these mesenchymal features
are present within epithelial cells, which is a feature
not seen in normal breast tissues.
Acquisition of EMT and/or stem cell-like biological
processes has been associated with therapeutic resis-
tance [7,43,44]. We observed that claudin-low tumors
do show a lower pCR rate than basal-like tumors (Fig-
ure 3a); however, the pCR rate of claudin-low tumors
was roughly equivalent to that of the HER2-enriched
subtype (without anti-HER2 therapies) and much higher
than luminal A or luminal B tumors. Thus, as has been
described for basal-like tumors [4], claudin-low tumors
show some chemotherapy sensitivity, yet patients with
these tumors still have poor survival outcomes overall
(Figure 3b). A potential explanation for this similar sce-
nario of basal-like and claudin-low tumors is that che-
moresistant cells with TIC or mesenchymal properties
are present at diagnosis in these two tumor subtypes as
suggested by our immunofluorescence dual staining
(Figure S9 in Additional file 1). This is also in concor-
dance with a previous immunohistochemical study of
491 breast tumors where high expression of mesenchy-
mal markers (i.e., vimentin, N-cadherin) and low expres-
sion of CDH1 were found almost exclusively in the
triple-negative subgroup of tumors [45]. However, our
treatment response data suggest that these tumor cells
with mesenchymal properties within basal-like and clau-
din-low subtypes might not have the same treatment
sensitivity to anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy.
Thus, further studies are needed to better characterize
the treatment sensitivity of claudin-low and basal-like
tumors to specific chemotherapeutics and/or targeted
therapies. The claudin-low nine-cell line centroid pre-
dictor developed here will assist immediately in identify-
ing the claudin-low subtype and its possible predictive
value in any neoadjuvant clinical trial with associated
microarray data. However, we acknowledge a potential
caveat of the nine-cell line claudin-low predictor, which
is that tumors with high stromal content might also be
identified as claudin-low. It is possible that the signature
set of genes that are high in claudin-low tumors (and
cell lines) are also high in nonepithelial cells, including
fibroblasts and other mesenchyme-derived cells. Thus,
we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the clau-
din-low tumors identified in this study are tumors with
low epithelial and high myofibroblast content. It is also
possible that this signature is one that can occur within
epithelial cells, within stromal cells, or both. Special
attention to the percentage of tumor cellularity of the
sample being analyzed and/or strategies that can differ-
entiate tumor cells with mesenchymal properties (i.e.,
immunoflourescence assays) from normal or tumor-
associated fibroblasts with mesenchymal properties are
needed for the further evaluation of this signature.
Finally, from a translational point of view, it is interest-
ing to note that the publicly available NCI-60 in vitro
drug-screening database includes six breast cancer cell
Prat et al. Breast Cancer Research 2010, 12:R68

lines, four of which are claudin-low (BT549, MDA-MB-
231, MDA-MB-435 and Hs578T) and two of which are
luminal (MCF-7 and T47D). Among them, MDA-MB-
435 cells have been shown to have melanoma character-
istics [46], which is still a controversial topic [47].
Nonetheless, there is a need to develop better screening
programs of drug sensitivity in breast cancer cell lines
that resemble the basal-like subtype, as this subtype is
missing from the NCI-60 set.
Invasive ductal, metaplastic and medullary or medul-
lary-like claudin-low carcinomas share important biolo-
gical relationships as defined by gene expression,
suggesting that yet to be discovered common oncogenic
changes might exist. Metaplastic and medullary carcino-
mas both have a high incidence of methylation of
BRCA1 [48,49], and ~50% of breast tumors from
BRCA1 mutation carriers show medullary-like features
[50]. In addition, MDA-MB-436 and SUM1315MO2
claudin-low cell lines have mutations in BRCA1 [51].
Moreover, we have shown that BRCA1 mutant basal-
like SUM149PT cell line has a small subpopulation of
cells with mesenchymal/claudin-low-like features, and
that these cells give rise to the basal-like cells that domi-
nate these cultures. These data suggest that BRCA1 defi-
ciency, which has been implicated in the differentiation
of MaSC or bipotent progenitors into ER-positive lumi-
nal cells [52], might also contribute to the development
or progression of undifferentiated claudin-low tumors
and cell lines.
Although we have not performed functional tumor
cell repopulating assays on human claudin-low tumors
to show their enrichment for TICs because of the low
incidence of these tumors (i.e., ~7 to 14%), there is,
however, evidence that the claudin-low cell lines identi-
fied here show stem cell properties and may be highly
enriched for TICs. For example, Charafe-Jauffret et al.
[53] reported that in addition to having EMT features
and high expression of stem cell markers such as
ALDH1, many of these cell lines contain functional
TICs. This is in concordance with another report [54]
that showed that MDA-MB-231, SUM159PT and
SUM1315MO2 have a high proportion (>90%) of CD44
+/CD24-/low cells, and that the CD44+/CD24-/low subpo-
pulation obtained from these cell lines was capable of
self-renewal, forming tumors in nonobese diabetic
severe combined immunodeficient mice, and were more
resistant to chemotherapy.
Lim et al. [24] delineated a human mammary epithe-
lial hierarchy by performing cell sorting on the basis of
two cell surface markers (CD49f and EpCAM) and a
series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, including
gene expression profiling of different subpopulations of
the normal breast. Using their microarray data, we
developed a genomic differentiation predictor that
classifies breast tumors on the basis of their differentia-
tion status along a continuous MaSC ® pL ® mL
epithelial hierarchy. We observed that the information
provided by the differentiation status adds prognostic
value even when considered with intrinsic subtype and
the classical clinical variables. However, as developmen-
tal studies further characterize the normal mammary
differentiation hierarchy, approaches such as the one
reported here can be improved. For example, much less
is known about other cell types in the normal breast,
such as the myoepithelial progenitors and other poten-
tial intermediate progenitors, which may be responsible
for the development of other rare breast cancer subtypes
such as medullary carcinomas. Finally, a similar genomic
approach based on FACS data coming from other devel-
opmental studies such as the ones by Lim et al. [24] or
Raouf et al. [23] might prove useful in leukemia [55] or
other solid tumors [56], where similar differentiation
hierarchies have been identified, and thus this differen-
tiation predictor algorithm may show benefit in cancers
other than breast cancer.
Integration of the claudin-low tumor subtype together
with the known intrinsic subtypes delineates a differen-
tiation hierarchy that resembles the normal epithelial
development. These data point to different cells of ori-
gin for each intrinsic subtype, or different stages of
developmental arrest for each subtype with a common
cell type of transformation, or some combination of the
two as different processes may be occurring for each dif-
ferent subtype. Indeed, Lim et al. [24] suggested that the
potential cell of origin of the basal-like subtype in
BRCA1 carriers might be the pL instead of the MaSC.
Alternatively, as suggested by our in vitro analyses of
the SUM149PT cell line, BRCA1-mutated basal-like
tumors might arise from transformation of a MaSC that
is similar to claudin-low tumors or cell lines, but the
claudin-low tumors stay arrested in this undifferentiated
state, while MaSC or claudin-low cells in basal-like
tumors are able to divide asymmetrically and give off
differentiated progeny that then arrest at the pL state
[57]. The therapeutic implication of the claudin-low
subtype will require additional retrospective and pro-
spective evaluations, but what does appear clearer is
that the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer may be
reflective of distinct stages of mammary epithelial cell
development and that the claudin-low tumors (and cell
lines) show the least differentiated phenotype.
Conclusions
It has become appreciated that breast cancer is not one
disease, but in fact represents multiple disease types,
each of which may require a unique treatment. In this
article, we characterize an important new disease group,
namely the claudin-low subtype of breast cancer, and

show that these tumors have a poor prognosis and fea-
tures of mesenchymal and mammary stem cells. We
also provide new tools for the identification and study
of this subtype in tumors and cell lines.

Studies on monocyte and macrophage biology and differentiation have revealed the
pleiotropic activities of these cells. Macrophages are tissue sentinels that maintain tis-
sue integrity by eliminating/repairing damaged cells and matrices. In this M2-like mode,
they can also promote tumor growth. Conversely, M1-like macrophages are key effector
cells for the elimination of pathogens, virally infected, and cancer cells. Macrophage dif-
ferentiation from monocytes occurs in the tissue in concomitance with the acquisition of
a functional phenotype that depends on microenvironmental signals, thereby accounting
for the many and apparently opposed macrophage functions. Many questions arise. When
monocytes differentiate into macrophages in a tissue (concomitantly adopting a speciﬁc
functional program, M1 or M2), do they all die during the inﬂammatory reaction, or do some
of them survive? Do those that survive become quiescent tissue macrophages, able to
react as naïve cells to a new challenge? Or, do monocyte-derived tissue macrophages con-
serve a “memory” of their past inﬂammatory activation? This review will address some
of these important questions under the general framework of the role of monocytes and
macrophages in the initiation, development, resolution, and chronicization of inﬂammation.
Keywords: monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, tissue-resident macrophages, functional phenotypes,

INTRODUCTION
In the healthy organism, the innate immune system provides the
ﬁrst line of defense against external or internal danger signals, by
initiating a protective inﬂammatory response that develops during
time through different phases, from initiation and full inﬂamma-
tion, to resolution and re-establishment of tissue integrity. The
ﬁrst phase of an inﬂammatory response is aimed at destroying
pathogens, and is followed by a phase in which dead and dying
cells, damaged extracellular matrix material, and cellular debris
are removed, to end up with a recovery phase in which the tissue
is repaired and restored to a healthy fully functional condition. In
fact, if the defense against harmful threats is a priority for avoiding
tissue damage, maintaining homeostasis (i.e., maintaining tissue
morphology and tissue function) is the ultimate goal of a tissue
in multicellular organisms (1). In this perspective, inﬂammation
presumably evolved as an adaptive response to tissue malfunction
or homeostatic imbalance (2). Thus,while the disease state is a dis-
placement from homeostasis, inﬂammation is the tissue response
for restoring homeostasis. However, since the inﬂammatory activ-
ities are potentially harmful to the host, these need to be tightly
controlled to avoid excessive tissue damage (3).
The mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) plays major roles
in development, scavenging, inﬂammation, and anti-pathogen
defenses, both by the direct elimination of foreign agents and
in organizing each different phase of the inﬂammatory process
(4). Under the term, MPS are grouped lineage-committed bone
marrow precursors, circulating monocytes, resident macrophages,
and dendritic cells (DC) (5). The development, homeostatic
maintenance, proliferation, differentiation, and function of the
MPS are regulated by the growth factors colony-stimulating fac-
tor (CSF)-1 and interleukin (IL)-34, the second ligand for the
CSF-1R (6, 7).
The issue of heterogeneity in the MPS still leads to a confusion
and debate about DC as truly distinct cells from macrophages,
with separate lineage and functions (8). In fact, macrophages and
myeloid DC possibly represent alternative differentiation options
of bone marrow progenitors and blood monocytes (9), with over-
lapping functions and marker expression. Reviewing this issue
is beyond the scope of this essay [we refer the reader to recent
excellent reviews on the topic; (9–11)], and will only focus on
monocytes and their relationship with macrophages.
The traditional view of the MPS suggests that recruited mono-
cytes (that become macrophages in tissues) are key players during
inﬂammation and pathogen challenge, whereas tissue-resident
macrophages have important roles in development, tissue home-
ostasis, and the resolution of inﬂammation. A basic concept of
the MPS is that blood monocytes are precursors that replace tis-
sue macrophages within a single developmental lineage (4). This
dogma needs now to be revised in the light of new evidence that
macrophages are endowed with self-renewal capacity and can pop-
ulate tissues before birth, deriving from early hematopoiesis in the
yolk sac (12, 13). The discovery of new macrophage progenitors
of embryonic origin forces us to reassess deﬁnitions, functions,
and cell–cell relationships within the MPS. We can synthesize it in
three key new questions:
1. Are monocytes more than circulating precursors and can they
have effector functions?

2. Is there a functional difference between the monocyte-derived
macrophages and the yolk sac-derived self-renewing resident
macrophages?
3. What is the relationship between monocytes and macrophages
and which are their mutual roles in different phases of
inﬂammatory reactions?
Another new perspective arises from the description of
macrophage polarization, i.e., the ability of macrophages to
acquire different functional phenotypes, enabling them to steer
adaptive immunity in different directions. This highlights the
central role of macrophages in immune defense, overturning
the long-held notion that macrophages need to be activated by
T-cells (14).
This review will summarize what has been so far investigated
and established on monocyte/macrophage biology, highlighting
what remains outstanding, and which questions are still unan-
swered. We will consider key studies that have been carried out in
mice, with reference to the human situation when data are avail-
able. We will review the various aspects (monocyte recruitment,
monocyte functions, macrophage polarization) before (homeo-
static conditions), during (inﬂammatory reaction), and after a
damaging event (resolution/repair).
MONOCYTES
MONOCYTE DEVELOPMENT AND HETEROGENEITY
Monocytes are a group of cells circulating in the blood, bone
marrow, and spleen, and constituting ~10% of the total leuko-
cytes in human beings and only 2–4% in mice. They have typi-
cal morphological features, such as irregular cell shape, oval- or
kidney-shaped nucleus, cytoplasmic vesicles, and high cytoplasm-
to-nucleus ratio. Monocytes can remain in the circulation for up
to 1–2 days, after which time, if they have not been recruited into
a tissue for facing a danger, they die and are removed. Mono-
cytes originate in the bone marrow from hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs) and develop through a series of sequential differentia-
tion stages: the common myeloid progenitor (CMP) (15), the
granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) (15), the common
macrophage and DC precursor (MDP) (16), and ﬁnally the com-
mitted monocyte progenitor (cMoP), a recently identiﬁed bone
marrow precursor that differs from MDP as it lacks CD135 expres-
sion (17). MDP gives rise also to common DC progenitors (CDP),
whose differentiation potential is restricted to the DC lineage
(18). Monocytes have been considered as the systemic reservoir
of myeloid precursors for renewal of tissue macrophages and DC.
However, many DC and macrophage subpopulations [for exam-
ple, lymphoid organ DC, plasmacytoid DC, skin Langerhans cells
(LC), and brain microglia] originate from the MDP independent
of monocytes (11, 18), and in some cases, they can even develop
directly from the bone marrow (19).
Homeostatic control of monocyte/macrophage development is
mostly inﬂuenced by CSF-1 (also known as M-CSF), produced by
stromalcellswithinthebloodandintissues(20).Maturemononu-
clear phagocytes in turn express CSF-1 receptors (CSF-1R) and
remove circulating CSF-1, allowing a feedback loop responsi-
ble for monocyte proliferation decrease (21, 22). Recently, the
cytokine IL-34 has been identiﬁed as able to bind and signal
through the CSF-1R (6, 23). Unlike broadly expressed CSF-1,
IL-34 expression is restricted to the epidermis and central ner-
vous system (24), where it supports the steady-state proliferation
of macrophages (LC and microglia, respectively). Granulocyte-
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is another fac-
tor involved in the development of mononuclear phagocytes but
only during the inﬂammatory state and not under homeostatic
conditions (25, 26).
Abundant experimental evidence indicates that recruited
monocytes are innate effectors of the inﬂammatory response to
microbes, and they kill pathogens via phagocytosis, production
of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), myeloperox-
idase, and inﬂammatory cytokines (27). In some circumstances,
monocytes can trigger and polarize T-cell responses (27, 28) and
may also contribute to angiogenesis and atherogenesis (29).
Human peripheral blood monocytes are not a homogeneous
population. Monocyte heterogeneity was ﬁrst reported with
the identiﬁcation of a minor population of CD16 (FcγRIII)-
expressing cells within circulating human monocytes (30). In
recent years, investigators have identiﬁed three functional sub-
sets of human monocytes, the characterization of which is still
in its infancy. Likewise, it is still unclear which are the speciﬁc
roles that they exert in homeostasis and inﬂammation in vivo,
in comparison with those of the previously described classically
and alternatively activated macrophages (see below). The new
nomenclature that groups monocytes into three subsets, based
on the expression of the surface markers CD14 and CD16, has
recently been approved by the Nomenclature Committee of the
International Union of Immunologic Societies (31). Based on
this nomenclature, the major population of human monocytes
(90%) with high CD14 but no CD16 expression (CD14++CD16−
or CD14+CD16−) are termed classical monocytes, whereas the
minor population of human monocytes (10%) is further sub-
divided into the intermediate subset, with low CD16 and high
CD14 (CD14++CD16+ or CD14+CD16+), and the non-classical
subset, with high CD16 but with relatively lower CD14 expression
(CD14+CD16++ or CD14dimCD16+) (31). In this review,we refer
only to the main difference, terming classical monocytes simply as
CD14+, and non-classical as CD16+.
Over the recent years, an increasing amount of knowledge
has been gained in the ﬁeld of monocyte subpopulations. Many
authors demonstrated that the three subsets express different tran-
scriptomes (32–38), although discrepancies between studies were
evident. These discrepancies may be due to differences in cell isola-
tionmethodologyandinthepurityof thecellpopulationsisolated,
and the microarray methodologies, which use different amounts
of total RNA for the hybridization, different probes to identify
the genes, and even distinct solid supports for the probes (39).
However, there is stronger agreement for the proximity of rela-
tionship between the intermediate and non-classical monocyte
subsets, while the classical subset is the most distant subset (36).
The close relationship between intermediate and non-classical
monocytes suggests a direct developmental relationship between
them, although this has yet to be formally proven. Also, it needs to
be clariﬁed how the characteristics previously ascribed to CD16+
monocytes are distributed between intermediate and non-classical
subsets (36). Recent data suggested a sequential developmental

relationship between the two subsets based on the observation
that, in time course studies in inﬂammatory diseases, an increase
in the intermediate monocytes is followed by an increase of
non-classical monocytes (40).
The physiological role of the monocyte subsets in vivo is not
fully deﬁned. They might have different roles during the home-
ostasis, immune defense/inﬂammation, and tissue repair, in terms
of their capacity to become activated and secrete inﬂammatory
cytokines in response to different stimuli, antigen processing and
presentation, pro-angiogenic and patrolling behavior. The phe-
notypic and functional differences between the monocyte sub-
sets were recently discussed in an exhaustive review (41). The
authors of this review report a complete and referenced list
of studies on bacterial and viral infections, autoimmune dis-
eases, and inﬂammatory conditions, in which an expansion of
CD16+ cells in respect to other subsets has been observed. In
general terms, both human classical and intermediate monocytes
have inﬂammatory properties reminiscent of the murine Ly6C+
monocytes (also termed “inﬂammatory” monocytes) (42), while
non-classical monocytes display patrolling properties similar to
those of murine Ly6C−monocytes (also termed “alternative” or
“patrolling” monocytes) (43). Both human and mouse inﬂam-
matory monocytes express high levels of the chemokine receptor
CCR2 and low levels of the chemokine receptor CX3CR1, whereas
patrolling monocytes show a reverse pattern. Accordingly, inﬂam-
matory monocytes respond to the chemokine CCL2 that mediates
Ly6C+/CD14+ monocyte recruitment to inﬂammatory sites (44),
while patrolling monocytes respond to CX3C-chemokine ligand
1 [CX3CL1, the human fractalkine and mouse neurotactin; (45)],
a chemokine present both as soluble protein and as membrane-
bound chemokine form that is expressed on endothelial cells and
in tissues. Overall, it is clear that the subsets between human being
and mouse are similar but not identical (42, 46). Table 1 summa-
rizes the main features of monocytes in human beings and mice.
Of note, there is a clear difference in the proportion of the two
monocyte subsets,as Ly6C−cells represent about half of the circu-
lating monocytes in mice, whereas CD16+ monocytes account for
less than 15% in human beings (30). However, Ziegler-Heitbrock
hypothesized that the higher proportion of the Ly6C−in mouse
blood could be due to stressful blood drawing (cardiac puncture
under terminal anesthesia) that mobilizes these monocytes from
the marginal pool (46). This hypothesis still needs experimental
proof.
To date,a relevant question that is still open concerns the origin
of the various monocyte subpopulations. It should be kept in mind
that the majority of current knowledge derives from mouse stud-
ies. It is unknown if the monocyte subpopulations are end stages of
different differentiation paths of a common precursor, or whether
they represent subsequent maturation stages in a common path of
differentiation, where the intermediate subset could be a pheno-
typical and/or developmental intermediate between the classical
and non-classical subsets. The latter hypothesis seems to be the
most reliable. While initial studies suggested that Ly6C+ cells were
recruited under inﬂammatory conditions and did not serve as pre-
cursors to Ly6C−cells [which in turn were originally considered
the immediate precursors of resident macrophages; (43)], recent
evidence suggests that, in steady state, Ly6C+ monocytes are pre-
cursors of Ly6C−monocytes (48, 49), as shown in experiments in
which grafted Ly6C+ monocytes spontaneously differentiated into
Ly6C−inthebloodof recipientmice(48).Thisconversioncanalso
occur in the bone marrow, where Ly6C+ monocytes apparently
return in the absence of inﬂammation (47–49). More recently, it
has been suggested that CSF-1R signaling was required for the
maturation of monocytes from Ly6C+ to Ly6C−, as blockade of
this receptor leads to decrease in the number of Ly6C−cells,short-
ens their lifespan (48), and concomitantly increases the number
of Ly6C+ monocytes (50).
It has also been observed that development of the Ly6C−popu-
lation depends on the transcription factor NR4A1 (Nurr77) (51).
NR4A1 deletion alters the number of Ly6C−monocytes in the

Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
bone marrow but not in blood or spleen (52), but does not alter
the number of macrophages within tissues (53). This suggests that
either Ly6C−monocytes can develop from MDP within the bone
marrow, or that Ly6C−monocytes are a functional end stage. In
this regard,given that Ly6C−monocytes exhibit a long steady-state
half-life of 5–7 days [which in the absence of their renewal from
Ly6C+ monocytes can extend to 2 weeks; (48)] compared to ~8 h
for Ly6C+cells, Ly6C−monocytes might be considered as termi-
nally differentiated blood-resident macrophages or “vasculature
macrophages,” rather than bona ﬁde monocytes (48). Indeed, the
primary function of these cells seems to be that of patrolling the
vascular endothelium and monitoring its integrity (45, 51). Con-
versely,andinparallelwithhumanCD14+ cells,Ly6C+ monocytes
because of their short half-life are unlikely to have other functions,
and thus are more likely to be the direct precursors of the tis-
sue macrophages/peripheral mononuclear phagocytes described
in the original MPS model.
FUNCTION OF MONOCYTE SUBSETS DURING HOMEOSTASIS
(CLASSICAL VS. ANTIGEN-PRESENTING TISSUE MONOCYTES VS.
PATROLLING MONOCYTES)
The original concept of MPS implicated that classical mono-
cytes are recruited in the tissue to become tissue-resident
macrophages in homeostatic conditions, and inﬂammatory acti-
vated macrophages during an infection (27, 54). We will examine
more in detail the role of recruited cells during the inﬂamma-
tory response later, while here we will focus on the recruitment of
monocytes in homeostasis and their contribution to maintaining
the pool of tissue macrophages. In order to avoid misunderstand-
ings, it is important to agree on the deﬁnition of monocyte. In
our view, bona ﬁde monocytes are restricted to the blood com-
partment, and to the bone marrow and spleen (55), where they
wait to be released in the blood. For obvious reasons, in both
these compartments, monocytes should not initiate any inﬂam-
matory reaction, but they must be ready to be recruited into
the blood ﬁrst and subsequently to all organs and tissues. A
phenomenon was recently reported, termed “anticipatory inﬂam-
mation,” whereby Ly6C+ classical monocytes are released from
the bone marrow in diurnal rhythmic waves under the control
of circadian gene Bmal1 (or Arntl) (56) to provide an adequate
innate response to environmental challenges that are expected
to occur with a evolutionarily predicted frequency. Despite new
evidence supports the view that Ly6C+ classical monocytes are
not precursors of resident macrophages in all tissues and dur-
ing certain types of inﬂammation (see below), it is clear that
circulating monocytes contribute to the repopulation of tissue-
resident macrophages under homeostatic conditions in tissues
like the lamina propria of the small intestine and healthy skin.
Studies based on functional and lineage tracing and adoptive
transfer have revealed that Ly6C+ monocytes are precursors of
intestinal macrophages that have a short half-life of only 3 weeks
(57–59). Conversely, in the dermis are present both resident der-
mal macrophages and monocyte-derived macrophages (60, 61). A
recent work suggests that the number of macrophages is partially
replenished by monocytes also in the heart (62) and in the lung
(63). It is unknown why some tissue macrophages are constantly
maintained by circulating monocytes, whereas other populations
are independent on circulating monocytes (see below). The notion
that monocyte-derived macrophages derive from Ly6C+ cells sug-
gests that the repopulation/maintenance of resident macrophages
in steady-state conditions follows the same mechanism as that
occurring during inﬂammation.
The function of Ly6C+ monocytes in circulation remains
poorly deﬁned. In the attempt to identify an effective role of
monocytes in the blood in homeostatic conditions (besides being
precursor cells), a recent work has suggested a distinct surveil-
lance phenotype for Ly6C+ monocytes (64). These monocytes
can enter non-lymphoid organs without obligatory differentiation
into macrophages or DC. The authors propose that these mono-
cytes can upregulate MHC class II expression and subsequently
recirculate to lymph nodes, where they are able to present antigens
to T-cells. Considering that these cells retain a monocyte-like gene
expression proﬁle,the authors term them“tissue monocytes”(64).
This study contributes to revising the role of circulating mono-
cytes, suggesting that they are not only precursors of macrophages
but also effector cells.
Regarding the role of the Ly6C−subset in the blood in steady-
state conditions, intravital microscopy studies have established
that these cells display a “patrolling” phenotype, being able to
crawl on the luminal surface of the vascular endothelium (45,
51). This patrolling behavior, along with the ability to phagocy-
tose endothelial-associated particles, suggests that a primary role
of these monocytes is sensing and scanning the endothelial surface
for damage and/or the presence of pathogens (51). The patrolling
monocytes mainly respond via Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) to local
danger signals (while they are poorly responsive to bacterial prod-
uctssuchasLPS)byproducinginﬂammatorymediators(51).They
are able to induce the intravascular recruitment of neutrophils,
which trigger endothelial necrosis, and subsequently they clear the
resulting debris (51). A similar patrolling feature and TLR7/TLR8-
dependent reactivity were also detected in human CD14+CD16++
monocytes (35).
Consistent with their functional role of surveillance of the
endothelium integrity and with the fact that they are terminally
differentiated cells, we agree with the view that Ly6C−/CD16+
can be considered as the tissue-resident macrophages of the blood.
Regarding their ability to produce inﬂammatory factors,we specu-
late that the patrolling monocytes have a higher activation thresh-
old than Ly6C+ monocytes; therefore, they should be able to
produce an amount of inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines
sufﬁcient for coordinating the repair of a damaged endothelium,
but not enough to initiate a strong inﬂammatory reaction.
A summary of the roles of monocyte subsets in steady state vs.
inﬂammatory conditions is reported in Table 2.

Resident macrophages are heterogeneous and versatile cells found
in virtually all tissues of adult mammals, where they can represent
up to 10–15% of the total cell number in quiescent conditions.
This number can increase further in response to inﬂamma-
tory stimuli. The specialization of macrophages in particular
microenvironments explains their heterogeneity. Macrophages

Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
take different names according to their tissue location, such as
osteoclasts (bone) (see Box 1), alveolar macrophages (lung),
microglial cells (CNS), histiocytes (connective tissue), Kupffer
cells (liver), and LC (skin). These populations have such highly
different transcriptional proﬁles that they could be considered
as many different and unique classes of macrophages (74). On
the other hand, the functions of macrophages are the same in
all tissues. They are key players in tissue development (by shap-
ing the tissue architecture), in immune response to pathogens (by
generating and resolving the inﬂammatory reaction), in surveil-
lance and monitoring of tissue changes (by acting as sentinel and
effector cells), and especially in maintenance of tissue homeostasis
(by clearing apoptotic or senescent cells, and by remodeling and
repairing tissues).

The view that tissue macrophages originate from circulating
peripheral blood monocytes that migrate into tissues under a vari-
ety of stimuli, proposed and strongly supported by van Furth in
the 1970s (4, 75, 76), needs to be reconsidered. In addition to
a wealth of old data (77, 78), two new pieces of evidence have
further weakened the view that monocytes are the precursors
of tissue macrophages in steady-state conditions: (1) the ﬁnd-
ing of the macrophage origin from embryonic progenitors that
seed developing tissues before birth and give rise to fetal tissue
macrophages (79) and (2) the self-maintaining ability of tissue-
resident macrophages through local proliferation in adulthood
(13). The latter ﬁnding will be discussed hereafter.
Two main phases of embryonic hematopoiesis have been
described in the mouse: primitive hematopoiesis and deﬁnitive
hematopoiesis. The former takes place in the ectoderm of the
yolk sac and gives rise to macrophages without going through
a monocytic progenitor. The latter takes place in the fetal liver,
which is initially seeded by hematopoietic progenitors from the
yolk sac and subsequently by HSCs from endothelium of the
aorta-gonads-mesonephros (80, 81). The fetal liver subsequently
becomes the source of deﬁnitive hematopoiesis that generates cir-
culating monocytes during embryogenesis. Spleen and bone mar-
row are also colonized via the circulatory system by hematopoietic
progenitors that will ultimately differentiate there. After birth,
upon bone formation, hematopoiesis passes from the fetal liver
to the bone marrow. The deﬁnitive bone marrow hematopoiesis is
the source of both Ly6C+ and Ly6C−circulating monocytes, from
which resident tissue macrophages were thought to derive (10).
The human embryonic hematopoietic system is organized
roughly in the same way as in the mouse (82), and early studies
propose that macrophages could arise in the embryo independent
of bone marrow progenitors in human beings [for more extensive
reading, see Ref. (83, 84)]. In summary, macrophages in fetal and
adult tissues derive from at least three sources: yolk sac (giving rise
to some tissue-resident yolk sac-derived macrophages), fetal liver
Box 1 A hint on osteoclasts.
Osteoclasts are multinuclear giant cells with a hematopoietic origin, commonly known as bone macrophages.They function in bone resorp-
tion and are involved in a normal skeletal development, growth, and modeling, for the maintenance of its integrity throughout life, and for
remodeling through calcium metabolism (65). Moreover, osteoclasts are able to interact with the hematopoietic system and the adaptive
immune system (66). Excessive bone loss mediated by osteoclasts plays a major role in certain pathologic conditions, such as rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) and osteoporosis (67, 68). On the other hand, insufﬁcient bone resorption due to the lack of functional osteoclasts (as in CSF-1R
knock-out mice) leads to excessive bone apposition and osteopetrosis (69).
Osteoclasts really seem a class of macrophages on their own.They are generated from mononuclear phagocyte lineage progenitors in the
bone marrow, and their differentiation from an osteoclast precursor (PreOC) depends on CSF-1 and the engagement of receptor activator
of nuclear factor-κB (RANK) and its ligand (RANKL), a speciﬁc osteoclast differentiation factor (70). Recently, it has been shown that also
IL-34 is involved in the osteoclast development (71).
Osteoclasts can differentiate in vitro from a cell population named monocyte-derived multipotential cells (MOMCs), which seem to originate
from circulating CD14+ monocytes (72). In vitro induction of MOMCs from circulating CD14+ monocytes apparently requires their binding
to ﬁbronectin, and exposure to soluble factor(s) derived from peripheral blood CD14dim monocytes (72).
Thus, culture of unfractionated peripheral blood monocytes with M-CSF and RANKL is sufﬁcient to induce their differentiation into
osteoclasts, and it has been assumed that osteoclast precursors are monocytes, although this has not been shown in vivo.
The question arises as to why osteoclasts, unlike other macrophages, have their own lineage of commitment and differentiation. Possibly,
the reason may lie in the fact that they are phylogenically closely linked to the presence of bone, a tissue that develops late as com-
pared to other organs and tissues during embryonic/fetal development, as in fact vertebrates are the most recent phylogenic step in the
evolution (73).

Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
(giving rise to fetal liver-derived macrophages), and bone marrow
(giving rise to tissue-resident bone marrow-derived macrophages
and inﬂammatory bone marrow-derived macrophages, see below)
(Figure 1). The primitive yolk sac-derived macrophages have
two distinct characteristics: (1) their pattern of differentiation
does not go through a monocytic intermediate state but they
directly become mature macrophages in fetal tissues (85) and
(2) unlike macrophages derived from deﬁnitive c-Myb-dependent
hematopoiesis, they are independent of the transcriptional factor
c-Myb during development, while depending on the transcrip-
tional factor PU.1 (12).
Based on different experimental approaches, from lineage trac-
ing (12, 48) to experiments carried out in parabiotic mice (64,
86), it is evident that monocytes do not contribute or con-
tribute only minimally to the maintenance of peripheral tissue-
resident macrophages in steady-state conditions in many adult
tissues. Fate-mapping experiments have shown that the adult
microglial cell population is exclusively derived from yolk sac
progenitors (87, 88), whereas for LC in adult skin it was clearly
demonstrated a mixed origin, from the yolk sac and from the
fetal liver (12, 89). Moreover, using Myb-deﬁcient mice that
lack development of HSCs, followed by transplantation with
genetically dissimilar bone marrow together with fate mapping,
it has been observed that yolk sac macrophages can generate
macrophages with a characteristically high expression of the F4/80
marker (F4/80 bright macrophages) in brain (microglia), skin
(LC), liver (Kupffer cells), pancreas, and spleen (12). In kid-
ney and lung, tissue-resident macrophages have a double origin,
encompassing F4/80high macrophages, derived from yolk sac, and
F4/80low macrophages, which have a hematopoietic origin and are
continuously replaced by bone marrow-derived progenitors (12).
Moreover,F4/80high shares a common gene signature with yolk sac
macrophages, unlike F4/80low cells, as shown by global transcrip-
tional analysis (12). Also, for splenic red pulp macrophages, alve-
olar, and peritoneal macrophages, an embryonic origin has been
conﬁrmed, rather than a monocyte origin (48). All these experi-
mentsshowthatearlyembryonicprogenitor-derivedmacrophages
can persist in tissues to adulthood. As mentioned previously, an
exception is the gut, which contains a large population of resi-
dent macrophages that are all blood monocyte-derived cells, in
steady-state conditions (57). How the mutual contribution of yolk
sac-derived macrophages and fetal liver-derived monocytes is reg-
ulated in each tissue is unknown, and likewise it is not known
how these two distinct populations of macrophages are func-
tionally and ontogenically related. Regarding how much yolk sac
progenitors contribute to originating adult tissue macrophages vs.
fetal liver hematopoiesis,there are different opinions. One hypoth-
esis is that fetal liver-derived monocytes proliferate and differen-
tiate into adult tissue macrophages markedly diluting the popula-
tion of yolk sac-derived macrophages (e.g.,in lung and heart). This
hypothesis stems from the observation that generation of yolk sac-
derived macrophages does not go through a monocytic intermedi-
ate, therefore being in contrast with normal adult hematopoiesis,
while a fetal liver origin for tissue macrophages would be reminis-
cent of the adult scenario in inﬂammation (90). Conversely,others
believe that all tissue macrophages derive from yolk sac during the
embryonic development, and circulating monocytes do not seed
the majority of the adult tissues in mice (except kidney and lung)
(12, 91) (Figure 2). This concept is strengthened by ﬁndings in
human beings, where a complete loss of CD16+ monocytes seems
to be of little consequence (92), and many tissue macrophage pop-
ulationsappeartobeintactinpatientswithmonocytopeniacaused
FIGURE 1 | Origin of tissue-resident macrophages in the mouse. In adult
tissues, macrophages derive from three sources. The ﬁrst is the yolk sac in
the embryo, where primitive hematopoiesis occurs giving rise to progenitors
that seed tissues with F4/80high macrophages. Later during fetal development,
hematopoiesis shifts from the yolk sac to the fetal liver (that seems to
contribute to the LC pool in the skin, possibly through a yolk sac-derived
progenitor). It is unknown whether other resident macrophages in other
tissues may also derive from fetal liver hematopoiesis. The third source is the
bone marrow, where deﬁnitive hematopoiesis occurs in the fetus and in the
adult, giving rise to monocytes and to monocyte-derived F4/80low
macrophages. Expression of murine F4/80 (the human EMR1) is an
insufﬁcient marker to discriminate between monocyte-derived macrophages
and tissue-resident macrophages. It seems that Ly6C+ monocytes are the
precursors of tissue macrophages, while the exact contribution of Ly6C−
monocytes remains unclear. HSC, hematopoietic stem cell; GMP,
granulocyte-macrophage progenitor; MDP, macrophage–dendritic cell
progenitor; LC, Langerhans cell; CSF-1, colony-stimulating factor 1; IL-34,

Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
FIGURE 2 | Distribution of tissue-resident macrophages and
monocyte-derived macrophages in tissues and organs. Monocyte
contribution to resident macrophages is highly tissue-dependent and varies
from no contribution for brain microglia and epidermal LC to complete
monocyte origin for intestinal lamina propria macrophages. The tissues
listed in the middle are those at the center of ongoing controversy (see the
main text), and for which a mixed contribution is probable. Here, we deﬁne
yolk sac-derived macrophages as tissue-resident macrophages, and both
fetal liver-derived macrophages and bone marrow-derived macrophages as
monocyte-derived macrophages (considering that bone marrow
hematopoiesis derives from fetal liver hematopoiesis). LC, Langerhans

by immune deﬁciency syndromes (93,94). In conclusion,to which
extent different populations of yolk sac-derived macrophages may
be later replaced by fetal liver-derived macrophages or monocytes,
and how yolk sac-derived tissue-resident macrophages can prolif-
erate locally through life to maintain their own pool independently
of adult monocyte input, these issues remain a matter of debate
(90, 91, 95). Thus, three main issues arise from all these ﬁndings:
1. The origin of adult macrophages in steady-state conditions can
vary considerably between tissues.
2. The exact role of the patrolling Ly6C−monocytes remains
unclear, while Ly6C+ monocytes are recruited predominantly
to sites of infection or injury, or to the organs and tissues that
have continuous cyclic recruitment of macrophages (such as
the uterus), or that are exposed to microbiota (such as the gut
and the skin).
3. Due to some limits and weaknesses of the published studies
(whole blood irradiation or other myelo-ablative treatments,
parabiotic mice, engrafted bone marrow or monocytes, adop-
tive transfer of radiolabeled cells,Cre-loxP-based fate mapping,
CCR2 or CSF-1 inactivation, etc.) (9, 90), none of such studies
provides conclusive evidence against a role for monocytes in
tissue macrophage homeostasis. Thus, more efﬁcient and spe-
ciﬁcfate-mappingmodelsof yolksac-derivedmacrophagesand
fetal liver-derived monocytes are needed, along with further
investigation, to determine which tissue macrophage popula-
tions are constantly replenished by circulating monocytes and
which are not.
SELF-RENEWAL/PROLIFERATION CAPACITY OF TISSUE-RESIDENT
MACROPHAGES IN HOMEOSTASIS
Given that it is currently not possible to discriminate the
two populations of tissue macrophages (yolk sac-derived and
monocyte-derived) during homeostasis,we will report their ability
to proliferate without considering them as distinct subpopula-
tions. In any case, we will bear in mind the notion that the tissue
macrophages can maintain their number in the absence of mono-
cyte precursors both in steady-state conditions (12, 48, 64, 86) as
well as in genetically or experimentally monocytopenic situations
(94, 95).
It is important to clarify the difference between self-renewal
and proliferative capacity. As stated by Sieweke and Allen (13), in
immunology, self-renewal is understood as a replacement of a cer-
tain cell population, while in stem cell research as the capacity to
generate with a cell division a daughter cell showing the same iden-
tity as the parental cell. Local proliferation of tissue macrophages
can be considered as self-renewal in both senses [see Ref. (12,
13)], since macrophages can proliferate without change of their
differentiated phenotype (96). Having said that, recent evidence
demonstratedthatmacrophageswithintheadulttissuesself-renew
via proliferation in homeostatic conditions rather than through an
inﬂux of progenitors. This has been shown for LC, which are able
to proliferate (97) both in human beings (98) and in mice (99),
for brain microglia (19), resident peritoneal macrophages (100),
and alveolar macrophages (101). The self-renewal process is regu-
lated by growth factors and cytokines such as CSF-1 and GM-CSF
(Box 2).
Resident macrophages can proliferate at low levels in steady-
state conditions, but proliferation rates strongly increase after
macrophage depletion (86) or under inﬂammatory challenge (13).
Regarding their proliferative ability, Ginhoux and Jung (90) raise
the interesting question as to “whether all macrophages within
a tissue possess equal self-renewal potential, or whether there
are macrophage subpopulations that differ in their capacity of
survival and proliferation, which would imply the existence of
macrophages subpopulations with stem cell-like features.” The
questionarisesfromobservationsthatphysiologicalorexperimen-
tal depletion of LC leads to a clonal expansion of LC by adjacent
proliferative cell clusters with stem cell-like features (120), and
that among lung macrophages, different cells can proliferate to
maintain the population (87). To solve this issue, there is evi-
dence that a macrophage that had previously divided has the same
probability of entering the cell cycle as a cell that had not, sug-
gesting the same proliferative ability for all macrophages (87).
This is consistent with the observation that macrophages geneti-
cally modiﬁed to have an indeﬁnite self-renewal potential can be
efﬁciently cloned (96).
During inﬂammation, things are quite different, espe-
cially because the tissue is enriched with monocyte-derived
macrophages. We will discuss later the replenishment of tissue
macrophages by monocyte-derived macrophages and their ability
to proliferate.

the main body tissues. These functions, mirroring different phe-
notypes (74, 143), are speciﬁc because depending on different

Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
Box 2
Factors driving monocyte/macrophage self-renewal, proliferation, and functional differentiation.
Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF, also known as CSF-1) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) drive
the monocyte/macrophage development, differentiation, and proliferation along with cytokines such as IL-4 (102) and the recently discov-
ered IL-34 (103). Macrophages and circulating monocytes express the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) (42, 43), and mouse deﬁcient in CSF-1R
(osteopetropic mice, op/op) have a decreased number of monocytes in the bone marrow and in circulation, in addition to a decrease in
osteoclasts (69, 104). Experimentally blocking CSF-1R with antibodies leads to a reduction in Ly6C−monocytes (69) and to an associated
increase in Ly6C+ monocytes, suggesting the involvement of CSF-1 in the maturation of monocytes from Ly6C+ to Ly6C−(48, 104). CSF-1 is
constitutively produced by mesenchymal cells (105) and is detectable in circulation in resting conditions (20). Under homeostatic conditions
(106), CSF-1 promotes monocyte development and macrophage proliferation (107), which is controlled in a negative feedback loop. In fact,
mature mononuclear phagocytes express high level of CSF-1R and are responsible for the clearance of CSF-1. The decreased CSF-1 levels
lead to a decrease in mononuclear cell proliferation, thereby maintaining the cell number to normal levels both systemically and locally [(21,
22); a model of CSF-1-dependent local homeostasis of macrophage density has been described by Jenkins and Hume (9)]. Thus, elevated
production of CSF-1 can drive both an increased proliferation of resident macrophages and an increased recruitment of monocytes (103, 108)
via macrophage production of CCL2 (109). CSF-1 deﬁciency in mice affects distinct tissues by different degrees, ranging from marked cell
loss in the gut, kidney, peritoneal cavity, and in circulation, as compared to liver (86). CSF-1 is also involved in the proliferation of splenic red
pulp macrophages and bone marrow macrophages (110). GM-CSF is also critical for macrophage homeostasis and proliferation, especially
in the lung (111) and in the peritoneal cavity in vivo (112), but it is less important in hematopoiesis, and, therefore, for monocyte development
(113). GM-CSF can support monocyte expansion and differentiation in vitro (25, 114), and it seems to be mainly involved in induction of
hematopoiesis during inﬂammation rather than in homeostasis (115, 116). CSF-1 and GM-CSF are also involved in monocyte/macrophage
functional differentiation programs: CSF-1 stimulation leads to a homeostatic or anti-inﬂammatory M2-like phenotype (25, 117, 118), whereas
GM-CSF leads to an M1-like inﬂammatory phenotype (25, 117–119).Thus, CSF-1 stimulation represents a default homeostatic/M2 pathway
of monocyte development (119). In summary, CSF-1 is mainly involved in self-renewal of tissue macrophages, consistent with its role in
M2 polarization, while GM-CSF is involved in proliferation of monocyte-derived inﬂammatory macrophages, consistent with its role in M1
polarization.

Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
bone marrow (10), phenotypes that are necessary for the tissue-
speciﬁc needs of defending, maintaining, and regaining home-
ostasis (144). These homeostatic functions may be altered by
chronic insults, which may lead to an anomalous prolonga-
tion/ampliﬁcationof themacrophageattempttoregainhomeosta-
sis and to a consequent causal association between macrophages
and diseases (Table 3). In pathological conditions, the distinction
between tissue-resident macrophages and recruited inﬂamma-
tory macrophages has not yet been possible. For an in-depth
analysis of these issues, the reader can refer to recent exhaustive
reviews (99, 144, 145). Apart from tissue-speciﬁc functions, tissue
macrophages share a series of common functions encompass-
ing clearance of cell debris, immune surveillance, wound healing,
defense against pathogens, and the initiation and resolution of
inﬂammation. In this review, we will only focus on the role of
macrophages in inﬂammatory responses, considering their capac-
ity to polarize into different functional phenotypes in response
to the tissue microenvironmental changes that occur during the
different phases of an inﬂammatory response. This polarization
process is based on the M1–M2 paradigm (see below).
PLASTICITY OF MONOCYTES/MACROPHAGES DURING
INFLAMMATORY REACTION
MONOCYTE RECRUITMENT DURING THE INFLAMMATORY REACTION:
INFLAMMATORY MONOCYTE-DERIVED MACROPHAGES VS.
TISSUE-RESIDENT MACROPHAGES AND THEIR PROLIFERATIVE ABILITY
During the ﬁrst phases of an inﬂammatory reaction, there is
in the tissue an increase of the effector cell number, necessary
for increasing the immune defensive ﬁrepower. These cells are
monocyte-derived macrophages. The concomitant drastic loss of
resident macrophages, due to tissue adherence, emigration, or
death, is a phenomenon termed “the macrophages disappearance
reaction”(146), and it is especially evident for peritoneal and alve-
olar macrophages. To cope with the need of increasing the number
of effector cells, two strategies come into play.
First is the recruitment of blood monocytes, driven by resident
macrophages alongside with other tissue cells. Recruited blood
monocytes are a source of inﬂammatory macrophages, which
take the name of bone marrow-derived or monocyte-derived
inﬂammatory macrophages. The other strategy is the increase of
tissue-resident macrophage proliferation by enhancement of their
self-renewal ability.
Central to the issue of monocyte recruitment is the difference in
monocyte subset trafﬁcking. Such differences have been observed
to occur during acute and chronic inﬂammation in mice, and
underline the fact that the monocyte subsets are under the con-
trol of distinct trafﬁcking mechanisms, with the classical subset
being recruited via CCR2 and the non-classical one utilizing a
CXCR1-dependent pathway (see Box 3).
In a model of Listeria monocytogenes infection, non-classical
monocytes (Ly6C−) extravasate rapidly within 1 h, invade the sur-
rounding tissues, and develop a very early inﬂammatory response
by producing chemokines responsible for recruiting other effec-
tors cells (granulocytes, NK cells, T-cells), and cytokines such
as TNF-α (central to macrophage-mediated inﬂammation and
innate responses) (45). This inﬂammatory response is transient,
and 8 h after infection, the main producers of inﬂammatory
cytokines in the tissue are the classical monocytes (Ly6C+). As
Box 3
Chemokines and monocyte recruitment mechanisms.
The two main chemokines and related receptors involved in the inﬂammation-dependent recruitment of the Ly6C+ and Ly6C−monocyte
subsets from the blood, bone marrow, and spleen, are CCL2/CCR2 and CX3CL1/CX3CR1, respectively (45, 46). Fibroblasts, epithelial, and
endothelial cells produce CCL2 in response to inﬂammatory cytokines or microbial molecules, and generate a high level of this chemokine
in the inﬂamed tissue (to allow egress of monocytes from the blood and entry in the tissues) and/or in blood (to allow entry of bone marrow
monocytes) (44, 147). Recently, it has been proposed that both mesenchymal cells and progenitor cells closely apposed to bone marrow
vessels can produce CCL2 in inﬂammatory situations, to allowing the egress of monocytes from the tissue and their subsequent entry
into the blood (148). During a bacterial infection, Ly6C+ monocytes require CCR2 for being recruited from the bone marrow into the blood
(149). In mice lacking CX3CR1, a reduction of patrolling by Ly6C−was observed (45), and a reduction of their number in infracted heart
(150), suggesting an impaired recruitment from the blood. Genetic destruction of CCR2 reduces the accumulation of both Ly6C+ and Ly6C−
monocytes in injured skeletal muscle, but it does not alter the recruitment of Ly6C−monocytes in the heart after myocardial infarction
(150). A reduction was also observed in skin wounds on the ﬁrst day from injury, when Ly6C+ cells are those principally involved in the early
repair phases, but not during the late stage of tissue repair, when Ly6C−cells are dominant (151). These studies underline the importance
of monocyte recruitment from blood to the tissue in the injured cardiac or skeletal muscle. Regarding the role of in situ differentiation,
in addition to the data mentioned above (150), a reduction of Ly6C−monocytes has been observed also in the blood of CCR2-deﬁcient
mice, despite the fact that they do not express this receptor (48). Macrophage accumulation in skin wounds is also reduced in mice lacking
CX3CR1 (152). CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 provide a survival or anti-apoptotic signal to Ly6C−cells (153). Two models have been proposed for
the CCL2-dependent Ly6C+ cell recruitment from the bone marrow: CCL2 increases monocyte chemokinesis and contact with blood ves-
sels; CCL2 associates with tissue glycosaminoglycans and forms a gradient driving monocytes to exit the bone marrow for entering into
circulation (54). Intravenous administration of CCL2 leads to the mobilization of monocytes into the circulation, which is consistent with a
role for peripheral CCL2 production responsible for replenishment of circulating monocytes from bone marrow (154).
Under steady-state conditions, the release of Ly6C+ and Ly6C−monocytes from bone marrow depends on two genes, the circadian clock
gene Bmal1 for Ly6C+ cells (55), and the G-coupled receptor for sphingosine-1-phosphate S1PR5 for Ly6C−monocytes (155). In mice with
myeloid cell-restricted Bmal1-deﬁciency, the rhythmic release of CCL2 was ablated along with monocyte pools.Thus, myeloid cells produce
low diurnal levels of CCL2 in a circadian fashion, and CCL2 in turn stimulates the release of CCR2-expressing monocytes from the bone
marrow into the blood. On the other hand, in S1PR5-deﬁcient mice, Ly6C−monocytes are retained in the bone marrow and are not released
in the blood and spleen.

Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
previously mentioned (45), it has been observed that the two
subsets of monocytes differentiate into two distinct cells types.
Ly6C−patrolling monocytes initiate a macrophage differentiation
programthatresemblesthatof M2macrophages(seebelow),while
Ly6C+ monocytes differentiate into DC-like cells that resemble
Tip-DC (45). However, in other systems, this double recruit-
ment of different monocyte subsets has not been observed. Only
Ly6C+ monocytes were observed to migrate to the injured tis-
sue in a model of skeletal muscle injury and be responsible for
early inﬂammatory responses (156). Generally, classical mono-
cytes inﬁltrate inﬂamed tissues more robustly than their non-
classical counterparts, and their number is signiﬁcantly increased
in the circulation during systemic or chronic infection (27). After
engulﬁng dying cells in the tissue, the recruited classical mono-
cytes differentiate into cells that resemble Ly6C−monocytes, and
become involved in tissue repair mechanisms (156). Likewise, in
a mouse model of sterile wound (subcutaneous polyvinyl alco-
hol sponge implantation), it has been recently demonstrated that
Ly6C+ monocytes recruited from the circulation into the skin
acquired an inﬂammatory function and, despite time of mat-
uration was long, they matured into Ly6C−macrophages with
repair functions (157). Yet, another situation is that of myocar-
dial infarction, during which both monocyte subsets appear to
home to the same tissue at different stages of inﬂammation
(150). Speciﬁcally, the Ly6C+ subset ﬁrst inﬁltrates the infracted
heart and exhibits inﬂammatory functions, while the Ly6C−sub-
set is recruited at a later stage and promotes tissue healing by
expressing high amounts of vascular endothelial growth fac-
tor, exhibiting angiogenic capacity, and promoting deposition of
collagen (150).
In atherosclerosis, as a model of chronic inﬂammation, both
monocyte subsets are recruited at the same time to the acti-
vated endothelium/plaques, and healing seems to be correlated
with a reduction in total monocyte recruitment (158). However,
it was recently demonstrated that the maintenance and accumula-
tion of monocyte-derived macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques
mainly depend on local proliferation of bone marrow-derived
macrophages rather than on the inﬂux of circulating monocytes
(127, 159). In an atopic dermatitis model and in experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a massive proliferation of LC and
microglia cells has been observed (160, 161), despite a signiﬁ-
cant monocyte inﬂux (161). In the peritoneal cavity and in the
lung, where the macrophage disappearance phenomenon occurs
upon bacterial and virus insults, the few remaining macrophages
are responsible for repopulating the tissue (86, 101, 106). Sim-
ilarly, in the context of Th2-mediated immunity against nema-
tode infection, IL-4 drives tissue-resident macrophage expansion
in the pleural cavity in the absence of peripheral monocyte
recruitment (102).
Proliferation of macrophages is observed in a variety of human
diseases [see Ref. (91)], including tumor-associated macrophages
in solid tumors (162), and adipose tissue-associated macrophages
in obesity (163).
In this context, a question is still open. Having established
that monocytes are recruited into tissues during an inﬂamma-
tory event, to what extent are they capable to differentiate in
tissue macrophages and to proliferate? As proposed by Jenkins
and Hume, the negligible contribution of monocytes to the pool
of resident macrophages could be due to the fact that mono-
cyte recruitment is speciﬁcally aiming at providing a population
of functionally differentiated cells needed for resolving an acute
inﬂammatory event, rather than being triggered by the home-
ostatic need of maintaining the autonomous pool of resident
macrophages (9). This view is supported by another interesting
hypothesis, i.e., in inﬂammatory conditions, monocyte-derived
macrophages are mostly end-type killer cells, as the non-speciﬁc
toxic molecules they produce will also cause their own death (164).
The gastrointestinal tract provides evidence in favor of this
hypothesis. In the gut, blood monocytes are constantly recruited
to the tissue where they contribute to maintaining the resi-
dent macrophage population, but during an inﬂammatory event
they re-program their differentiation plan toward adopting an
inﬂammatory phenotype (57, 165).
Thus, we should consider that monocyte-derived macrophages
adopt different and opposing phenotypes based on microenvi-
ronmental signals. Adoption of a phenotype or another depends
on the time by which the sequential waves of recruited Ly6C+
monocytes reach the tissue during the course of the inﬂamma-
tory reaction, since the incoming monocytes will ﬁnd a different
microenvironment in different phases of the reaction. In this con-
text, it is conceivable that monocytes entering the tissue at later
times could ﬁnd conditions favorable to adopting an M2-like phe-
notype (see above), thereby becoming tissue macrophages over
time.
Inﬂammatory monocyte-derived macrophages (12,86) and tis-
sue monocytes (64) can be phenotypically and functionally distin-
guished from resident macrophages in many tissues. In the central
nervous system, inﬂammatory monocyte-derived macrophages
do not contribute to the resident population (161). In con-
trast, fate-mapping experiments revealed that monocyte-derived
macrophages recruited to the peritoneal cavity upon thioglycol-
late injection differentiate into resident macrophages and persist
over time (48). The fraction of monocyte-derived macrophages
that do not die upon inﬂammation and become tissue-resident
macrophages share gene proﬁling with resident macrophages (45,
64, 165), but there is no information as to whether they are
functionally different or not.
The accumulation of inﬂammatory monocytes in an inﬂamed
tissue is due to their inﬂux from blood rather than by their prolif-
erative ability, and in fact inﬂammatory signals of microbial origin
generally prevent their proliferation. An exception to this general
paradigm comes from a recent study that has demonstrated that
also inﬂammatory monocyte-derived macrophages can prolifer-
ate at certain stages during the resolution of zymosan-induced
peritonitis (106).
All these ﬁndings are summarized in Figure 3.
Finally, two issues should be reminded:
1. The precise nature and extent of the contribution of monocyte-
derived macrophages to tissue macrophages could depend on
how,and to which extent,inﬂammation or its cause has affected
the tissue-resident macrophages. In this view, as proposed by
Ginhoux and Jung (90), tissue-resident macrophages are more
involved in tissue macrophage repopulation after mild injury,

Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
FIGURE 3 | Schematic representation of monocyte and macrophage
populations in homeostasis and inﬂammation. Under homeostatic
conditions (left panel), Ly6C+ monocytes derive from the bone marrow and
circulate via the blood into the tissue. A minor fraction of these cells lose
Ly6C expression and become Ly6C−monocytes in the blood or in the bone
marrow where some of them might return in the absence of inﬂammation.
Ly6C+ blood monocytes enter tissues and become either macrophages, for
example, in the gut, lung, and dermis (monocyte-derived macrophages or
monocyte-derived tissue-resident macrophages). Some tissue
macrophages derive directly from yolk sac during the embryogenesis (e.g.,
LC, microglia, liver Kupffer cells, and alveolar macrophages), are long lived,
and are mainly maintained by self-renewal (tissue-resident macrophages).
Ly6C−monocytes act as resident macrophages of the vasculature,
patrolling, and monitoring the endothelial surface in the blood vessel lumen.
In the ﬁgure, the presence of “trained” macrophages is also considered,
which we deﬁne as “memory macrophages,” i.e., the tissue macrophages
that retain the memory of a previous inﬂammation and are in a quiescent
state in the tissue. During an inﬂammatory reaction (right panel), the
number of blood Ly6C+ monocytes recruited to an inﬂamed tissue increases
considerably. The large majority of these cells gives rise to the inﬂammatory
monocyte-derived macrophages, while some of them do not differentiate
into macrophages and remain monocyte-like cells, are able to take up
antigens, and to migrate to the draining lymph nodes (tissue monocytes).
These are the antigen-uptaking and -presenting cells of the tissue. During
inﬂammation, all macrophages (tissue-resident macrophages,
monocyte-derived tissue macrophages, inﬂammatory monocyte-derived
macrophages) are activated and differentiate into M1-like inﬂammatory cells
following interaction with pathogenic and damaged signals/insults in
surrounding microenvironment. These cells produce a series of cytokines
and other inﬂammatory factors. Tissue-resident macrophages increase their
capacity of proliferation to compensate the loss of macrophages caused by
the inﬂammatory reaction. Recent evidence demonstrates that also
inﬂammatory monocyte-derived macrophages are able to proliferate in a late
phase of the inﬂammatory reaction. Memory macrophages are important
players in the inﬂammatory reaction, as they can react to inﬂammatory
stimuli with a faster and stronger inﬂammatory cytokine production.The role
of circulating Ly6C−cells during an inﬂammatory reaction is not fully
identiﬁed. They probably remain in the blood vessels as sentinels, and in
some cases they could enter in the tissue, as it has been reported in the
case of myocardial infarction, to take up a repair function. HSC,

Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
while monocyte-derived macrophages are more involved in
severe inﬂammatory injuries.
2. In the mouse it seems that non-classical monocytes contribute
to the resident macrophage population. It is possible (although
there is little evidence in this respect) that when non-classical
monocytes are recruited in the inﬂamed tissue, they may differ-
entiate into alternatively activated macrophages, while classical
monocytes would give rise to classically activated macrophages.
In this context, the developmental relationship between the
different monocyte subsets and the different macrophage func-
tional phenotypes has yet to be fully and formally proven. No
evidence in this sense has been generated yet in human being
(see below).
MACROPHAGE DIFFERENTIATION AND FUNCTIONAL PHENOTYPES
Macrophage polarization occurs through different activation pro-
grams by which macrophages carry out their defensive functions.
In this way, macrophages become able to respond with appro-
priate functions in distinct contexts, functional diversity becom-
ing the key feature of these cells. Essentially, macrophages can
modify their metabolic functions from a heal/growth promoting
setting (M2 macrophages), to a killing/inhibitory capacity (M1
macrophages) (145, 166). The main difference between these cells
is that in M2 macrophages the arginine metabolism is shifted to
ornithine and polyamines, while in M1 cells it is shifted to NO
and citrulline (166). M2-produced ornithine can promote cell
proliferation and repair through polyamine and collagen synthe-
sis, ﬁbrosis and other tissue remodeling functions (167), while
M1-produced NO is an important effector molecule with micro-
bicidal activity and cell proliferation inhibitory capacity (168).
Interestingly, polyamine production per se has been reported to
be a driver of M2 polarization (169), and M2 is the normal
“default” program adopted by resident macrophages (170). More-
over, M1 and M2 macrophages have distinct features in terms
of chemokine production proﬁles (171), and iron and glucose
metabolism (172, 173).
The description of macrophages polarization is leading immu-
nologists to take a step back and revise their concept on how
the immune system works (14, 145). The M1 and M2 deﬁ-
nition was formulated by mirroring the Th1/Th2 polarization
concept. However, this deﬁnition might be misleading in that
it may suggest that Th1/Th2 cells do instruct M1/M2 polar-
ization, whereas it is now obvious that the reverse is true, i.e.,
macrophages are initiating and directing T-cell polarization. Since
it has been shown that distinct populations of macrophages pro-
mote and control CD4+ T-cell-dependent type 1 and type 2
immune inﬂammatory responses (i.e., those against viruses and
bacteria, and against multicellular parasites, respectively), not
surprisingly they have been termed M1 and M2 (166). Thus,
considering that macrophages recognize pathogens directly (174,
175), while T-cell do not, and considering that T-cells prolif-
erate through interaction with macrophages (176), it is logical
to think that macrophages are the cells that initiate and direct
T-cell response, and that the adaptive immune response needs
the triggering and guidance of innate immunity (14). Notably,
M1 and M2 macrophage activities do not need the presence of
lymphocytes (145). The fact that T-cell-derived cytokines such
as IFN-γ and IL-4 may amplify macrophage polarization (see
below) should not deceive us into believing that macrophage
polarization cannot occur without lymphocytes, as this is not
the case. In vitro, macrophages are activated toward an M1 func-
tional program by infectious microorganism-related molecules
(e.g., the gram-negative product LPS) and by inﬂammation-
related cytokines TNF-α or IFN-γ, alone or in combination. M1
macrophages are characterized in vitro by an IL-12hiIL-23hiIL-
10lo phenotype; are efﬁcient producers of toxic effector molecules
(ROS and NO) and inﬂammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF, IL-
6); participate as inducers and effector cells in polarized Th1
responses; and mediate resistance against intracellular parasites
and tumors (177). Conversely, M2-like polarization has been
observed in vitro in response to the Th2-related cytokines IL-4
or IL-13 (178), to the concomitant triggering of Fcγ receptors
and Toll-like receptors (TLR), to immune complexes, and to
anti-inﬂammatory molecules such as IL-10, TGF-β, and gluco-
corticoids (115). The variety of functional programs adopted by
macrophages in response to the stimuli listed above has been
termed M2a (IL-4 and IL-13; alternative inﬂammation), M2b
(immunecomplexes,FcγR/TLRtriggering),andM2c(IL-10,TGF-
β, glucocorticoids; deactivation) (178, 179). M2 cells are charac-
terized in vitro by an IL-12loIL-23loIL-10hiTGF-βhi phenotype and
generally have high levels of scavenger, mannose, and galactose-
typereceptors.Ingeneral,thesemacrophagestakepartinpolarized
Th2 responses, allergy, parasites clearance, dampening of inﬂam-
mation, tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, immunoregulation, and
tumor promotion (180).
Macrophage taxonomy is an attempt to rationally categorize an
extended variety of cell functions. Indeed, the M1/M2 paradigm
is a limited attempt to deﬁne the complexity and plasticity of
mononuclear phagocytes. In vivo, macrophages can adopt a vari-
ety of functional phenotypes depending on subtle and continuous
changes in the tissue microenvironment. So, the M1/M2 polariza-
tion of macrophage functions may be taken as a simpliﬁed con-
ceptual framework describing a continuum of diverse functional
states, of which M1 and M2 activation states are not ontogeni-
cally deﬁned subsets but represent the extremes (180–182). In this
regard, Mosser and Edwards (181) have suggested a macrophage
classiﬁcation that takes into account the three functions of these
cells in maintaining homeostasis: host defense, wound healing,
and immune regulation. Classifying macrophages according to
these functions provides three basic macrophage populations:
classically activated macrophages, wound-healing macrophages,
and regulatory macrophages (183, 184). The authors believe that
this classiﬁcation also helps to illustrate how macrophages can
evolve to exhibit characteristics that are shared by more than one
macrophage population (181).
Without going into details [for which we refer the reader
to other reviews; (14, 185)], the M1/M2 classiﬁcation in differ-
ent subsets can create the illusory perception of a heterogeneity,
which is not proven to exist in vivo. Thus, as already mentioned
above, it is logical to hypothesize that the subsets are varying mix-
tures of M1- and M2-type macrophages, as observed in the lung
and in the peritoneal cavity, where tissue-speciﬁc variations in
the balance of M1- and M2-type responses have been revealed
(74, 186). This situation has also been observed in pathological

conditions, where macrophages can develop mixed M1 and M2
phenotypes (187,188). Moreover,it has also been proposed to con-
sider the heterogeneity of macrophage functions as a consequence
of interaction with different immunological pathways (e.g., inter-
action with different growth and survival factors, interaction with
lymphoid and myeloid cytokines, interaction with pathogens, res-
olution), rather than attributing them to distinct macrophages
subsets (185).
In summary, the initial inﬂammatory response is carried out
by activated macrophages in classical or alternative modality
(depending on the triggering events),aiming at eliminating invad-
ing microbes by promoting the inﬂammatory response. Then, the
resolution phase is carried out by macrophages in deactivated
modality, unresponsive to inﬂammatory stimuli, and active in the
elimination of the injured cells and tissue components, in pro-
moting angiogenesis, cell proliferation, matrix deposition, and in
general in tissue remodeling. The mechanisms that account for
macrophage deactivation play a key role in maintaining home-
ostasis and keeping the immune response under control (189).
Both innate and adaptive signals can inﬂuence the macrophage
functional phenotype, which can have potentially dangerous con-
sequences if not appropriately regulated. For example, classically
activated M1 macrophages can cause damage to host tissues,
predispose surrounding tissue to neoplastic transformation and
inﬂuence glucose metabolism by promoting insulin resistance.
Macrophages that are normally involved in wound healing can
promote ﬁbrosis,exacerbate allergic responses,and be exploited by
pathogens for intracellular survival. These M2-type macrophages
cancontributetotheprogressionof neoplasiabypromotingtumor
survival (see Table 3).
CURRENT HYPOTHESIS ON MACROPHAGE POLARIZATION
Plasticity and ﬂexibility are key features of macrophages and of
their activation states. A controversial issue is whether a pheno-
typic and functional evolution of macrophages occurs in vivo, and
how it happens. As mentioned above, it has been observed in mice
that the M1 to M2 switch during the progression of the inﬂamma-
tory response enables macrophages to perform different activities
in the different phases of the reaction. The controversy refers to
the mechanisms underlying this switch, i.e., whether M1 and M2
macrophages are phenotypically distinct subpopulations that can
serve different functions in different phases of an inﬂammatory
reaction (45, 150), or the same cells can shift from one to another
functional phenotype in response to microenvironmental signals
(156, 157).
Several hypotheses are attempting to explain the issue. A ﬁrst
hypothesis is that different subsets of monocytes or macrophages
can adopt a different functional phenotype. Thus, Ly6C+ mono-
cytes and/or monocyte-derived macrophages in the tissue become
M1 macrophages, and Ly6C−monocytes and/or tissue-resident
macrophages become M2 macrophages. It is possible that resi-
dent macrophages maintain cytoprotective and reparative func-
tions, whereas macrophages derived from circulating inﬂamma-
tory monocytes perform mainly M1 type functions. This hypoth-
esis is not fully supported by the studies previously cited, where in
different situations it was possible to observe both the differentia-
tion of Ly6C+ cells in M1 and of Ly6C−cells in M2 (45, 150) and
the transdifferentiation from Ly6C+ M1 cells to Ly6C−M2 cells
(156, 157).
A second hypothesis is that there are sequential waves of
monocyte recruitment into a tissue throughout the course of
an inﬂammatory reaction. Therefore, monocytes recruited into
the tissue at different times encounter different microenviron-
ments with different signals that can polarize them in M1 dur-
ing early phases and in M2 in late phases (156). In this case,
cytokines and other microenvironmental signals in the tissue play
a key role in determining the different functional phenotypes
of macrophages. Although the role of cytokines in steering the
macrophage functional phenotypes has been proven in vitro (179),
the situation could be very different in vivo, where M2 activity
is strongly increased in sterile wounds (157) or injured kidney
(190) in absence of Th2-like cytokines IL-4 or IL-13 (which in
any case do not induce the typical M2 phenotype, i.e., the deacti-
vated healing/repairing functional phenotype). In these cases, M2
macrophages derive largely from M1 macrophages, with mono-
cytes recruited from the circulation ﬁrst acquiring an inﬂamma-
tory phenotype, and then persisting in the tissue and maturing
into repair macrophages.
Based on the latter data, a third hypothesis is that polarized
macrophage populations can switch one to the other in response
to different conditions. Data from in vitro studies demonstrate
that human monocytes can acquire the phenotype of polarized
M1 macrophages and then mature into M2 repair macrophages
upon exposure in culture to sequential changes in the microen-
vironmental conditions (191). Other studies demonstrated that
M2 macrophages are reprogramed to express M1 genes following
exposure to TLR ligands or IFN-γ (192, 193).
A related question is whether both tissue-resident macrophages
and monocyte-derived macrophages can polarize in M1 or/and
M2 functional phenotypes. We have described above that tissue
macrophages have basically an M2-like phenotype, whereas inﬁl-
trating recruited monocytes differentiate in M1 or M2 depending
on the tissue conditions. For instance, it has been shown that
tissue-resident macrophages, rather than recruited monocytes, are
alternatively activated in the tissue during infection with Lito-
mosoides sigmodondis (102). Also, recruited monocytes can be
directly polarized into an anti-inﬂammatory M2 phenotype by
basophil-derived IL-4, in order to alleviate allergic inﬂamma-
tion in the skin (194). Although it is not possible discriminat-
ing between tissue-resident and monocyte-derived macrophages
in steady-state conditions, it seems that alternatively activated
tissue macrophages have a transcriptional proﬁle and pheno-
type different from that of alternatively activated monocyte-
derived macrophages, with the latter having immunoregulatory
properties (195).
It should be considered that in vitro studies do not fully
recapitulate in vivo differentiation for two main reasons:
1. These studies are generally based on an heterogeneous popula-
tion of monocytes, encompassing all the blood subsets (Ly6C+
and Ly6C−in the mouse, and CD14+ and CD16+ in human
being),thus it cannot be deﬁned whether upon different stimuli
the same cells can pass from a phenotype to another or whether
different subsets are activated in response to different stimuli.

Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
2. While M2 macrophages can convert to the M1 phenotype, the
reverse generally does not occur, or it may only occur in par-
ticular conditions (e.g., in very mild inﬂammatory responses).
In fact, M1 is probably an end-stage killer cell that dies during
the inﬂammatory response, possibly succumbing to its own
NO production, as it was demonstrated in vitro (196). So, their
selective death may give the impression that they convert in
M2 cells, which in fact proportionally increase (145). It seems
that M1 vs. M2 polarization correlates with the capacity of
macrophages to produce NO (166) as opposed to the important
M2 driver TGF-β (164, 197, 198), thus the decrease in NO-
producing macrophages would increase TGF-β production and
amplify M2 polarization.
There are cases in which a phenotypic switch in the macrophage
population occurs over time, often associated with pathology (91,
141). Three speciﬁc examples of this phenotypic switch are the
following:
endotoxin tolerance, an altered state of responsiveness to sec-
ondary stimulation with LPS, resulting in a global and sustained
switch of the gene expression program from an inﬂammatory
M1 signature to an anti-inﬂammatory phenotype (199);
obesity-induced insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes, and ather-
osclerosis lesions. These are metabolic syndromes that can lead
to a switch in the phenotype of adipose tissue macrophages
from wound healing (as in healthy non-obese human beings)
to classically activated macrophages (200, 201);
cancer,
where
the
tumor-inﬁltrating
classically
activated
macrophages have the potential to contribute to the earliest stages
of neoplasia (202–204), and then, as the tumor progresses, can
progressively differentiate to a regulatory phenotype and eventu-
ally become cells that share the characteristics of both regulatory
and wound-healing macrophages (181).
Although the pathology provides the proof-of-principle that
macrophages can undergo dynamic transitions between differ-
ent functional states, it is possible that a mixture of M1/M2
phenotypes underlies these conditions (14, 145, 166). In the
past few years, gene expression proﬁling techniques and genetic
approaches have been used to cast some light on the plas-
ticity of macrophage activation. The commonly held view is
that macrophage polarization is driven by cues in the tissue
microenvironment, which can include cytokines, growth fac-
tors, and microorganism-associated molecular patterns. These
signals are thought to dictate a transcriptional response that
shapes the phenotype and function of macrophages based on the
physiological or pathological context. Progress has been made
in deﬁning the molecular mechanism underlying macrophage
polarization, including signaling pathways, miRNA, epigenetic
modiﬁcation, post-transcriptional regulators, and transcriptional
factors (189, 205–207). However, the data are still incomplete
and far from being systematic, and our knowledge of the
mechanistic basis of macrophage diversity in different tissues
or in response to changing environment is to a large extent
unknown.
POST-INFLAMMATION FATE OF
MONOCYTES/MACROPHAGES
ANTIGEN PRESENTATION IN NON-LYMPHOID ORGANS
The capacity of taking up and presenting antigen (i.e., the link-
ing function between innate and adaptive immunity) is one of
the most important features of tissue macrophages (208). It has
been mentioned above that some monocytes that enter the tissue
during inﬂammation do not differentiate into macrophages, and
are able to take up antigen in the tissue and carry it to lymph
nodes where they can present it to naïve T-cells (64). In addi-
tion to this population of monocyte-like cells, tissue macrophages
are also able to present antigen, despite the fact that they do
not recirculate to lymph nodes after antigen uptake. That tissue
macrophages are highly phagocytic and can take up microorgan-
isms and other matter in the tissue is well known, as this is their
major function both in homeostasis and during inﬂammation.
That antigen presentation may occur also in non-lymphoid organs
has been suggested by several experimental evidence describing
antigen-speciﬁc local activation and expansion of primed T-cells,
but not of naïve T-cells (209–215). Based on this evidence, the
hypothesis proposed by Ley is that initial priming of naïve T-
cells occurs in the lymph node (to which antigen-loaded tissue
monocytes recirculate), but that the full activation and effector
functions of T-cells occur in the tissue where the inﬂammatory
reaction is taking place, upon the productive interaction and for-
mation of immunological synapse between primed T-cells and the
antigen-presenting tissue macrophages (the difference between
monocyte-derived tissue DC and tissue macrophages is bleared,
as they seem to be not much more than slightly different func-
tional differentiation states from a common precursor). Most
likely, the inﬂammatory monocyte-derived cells with an M1-like
functional phenotype are the antigen-presenting cells (APC) that
induce activation/polarization of effector Th1 and Th17 cells upon
production of IL-12 and IL-23, respectively, and in a TNFRSF
and TNFSF-dependent fashion (but independent of CD80, CD86,
and CD28 co-stimulation). Likewise, M2-like tissue macrophages,
which produce TGF-β and express the αVβ8 integrin are likely
involved in the polarization of iTreg cells, whereas their role in
Th2 polarization is less clear (208).
FATE OF ACTIVATED RESIDENT MACROPHAGES AND RECRUITED
MONOCYTES: PROLIFERATION, REPLACEMENT, AND M2-LIKE
POLARIZATION
Based on what described above, the cell populations present in the
tissue during the acute phase of an inﬂammatory reaction are the
following:
• Tissue-residentmacrophagesandmonocyte-derivedmacrophages.
These, after initial recognition of microbial or damage-
associated molecules, drive the inﬂux of blood-derived mono-
cytes, which will become inﬂammatory macrophages. Their role
in initiating the inﬂammatory reaction possibly depends on the
nature and grade of challenge.
• Monocyte-derived macrophages, newly recruited and rapidly
occupying the inﬂammatory lesion, becoming the majority of
the macrophages present in the tissue. These cells induce the

inﬂammatory response by differentiating in the M1 functional
phenotype.
• Tissue monocytes, the recently described cells that can take up
antigens in the tissue and move to lymph nodes, where they are
able to present antigens to naïve T-cells.
• Memory macrophages, or trained monocytes, cells functionally
programed by a previously stimulus for either enhanced (train-
ing) or decreased (tolerance) cytokine production, depending
on the type and concentration of the stimulus they encoun-
tered [(216); see below]. Here, we consider them as a kind
of resident inﬂammatory monocyte-derived macrophage, able
to react in a faster and stronger manner compared to other
macrophages.
A summary of the different macrophage types and of their fate
after the acute inﬂammatory phase is given in Figure 4.
In general, tissue-resident macrophages are maintained locally
by proliferative self-renewal (100,106),and retain an M2-like phe-
notype, for example, in the peritoneal cavity, brain, and lung (86,
100, 161). The fate of monocyte-derived resident macrophages is
hard to follow, considering that it is not possible to fully discrim-
inate between them. However, we may hypothesize that they have
the same fate of tissue-resident macrophages, i.e., they maintain
an M2-like phenotype and a low self-renewal capacity. A number
of cells of both populations probably die during inﬂammation,
the extent of their survival possibly depending on the nature and
magnitude of the insult.
Generally, the inﬂammatory monocyte-derived macrophages
are polarized toward M1, and the majority of them dies, killed
by their own NO production (see above). In an experimen-
tal acute lung injury model, these cells undergo Fas-mediated
death, while the resident alveolar cells persist (217). From that,
we can argue that M1 likely is a terminal differentiation pheno-
type. However, there are reports that they can also undergo in situ
phenotype conversation to become tissue-resident macrophages
either during inﬂammation or after experimental deletion of tissue
macrophages (48,86). This underlines the notion that macrophage
polarization is both transient and plastic.
The survival in the tissue of inﬂammatory monocyte-derived
macrophages raises important questions that need to be answered.
Do monocyte-derived tissue macrophages conserve a “mem-
ory” of their past inﬂammatory activation, thereby becoming
memory macrophages? And, do tissue macrophages resume their
previous functional phenotype in response to a new inﬂammatory
challenge? Or, do they react as naïve cells?
Memory macrophages (also recently termed “trained mono-
cytes”) have been described, which retain a memory of past chal-
lenges (see below). Their fate in the tissue is, however, unknown,
since no long-term experiments have been performed in mam-
mals. It is possible that a part of them dies after reacting to a
new inﬂammatory challenge. If some of them survive (again, this
possibly depends on the type and magnitude of the new chal-
lenge), they would probably behave like inﬂammatory monocyte-
derived macrophages,i.e.,they could become M2-like cells,having
a low level of self-renewal, and may also form a new popula-
tion of memory macrophages that retain the memory of multiple
challenges.
FIGURE 4 | Fate of the different monocyte/macrophage populations in
the tissue during the post-inﬂammatory phase. Tissue-resident
macrophages are in general maintained locally by proliferative self-renewal,
and retain an M2-like functional phenotype. The same situation is
hypothesized for monocyte-derived resident macrophages, since it is not
possible to fully discriminate between the two populations. A number of
cells of these two populations probably die during the inﬂammatory
reaction. Inﬂammatory monocyte-derived macrophages can die killed by
the NO they have produced, and the surviving cells can undergo in situ
phenotype conversion and become M2-like tissue-resident macrophages.
In addition, a number of these cells can conserve a “memory” of their past
inﬂammatory activation, and become trained monocytes/memory
macrophages. Monocytes recruited from the blood during the
post-inﬂammatory phase can lose the expression of Ly6C and become
Ly6C−cells, subsequently differentiating in M2 macrophages. They may
also become memory macrophages. Memory macrophages that are
present in the tissue, reminiscent of previous inﬂammatory events, would
probably behave like naïve macrophages upon a new inﬂammatory
challenge, except for a much quicker reaction, and will, therefore, mostly
die or generate M2-like macrophages or again memory macrophages. Their
life span in the tissue is presently unknown.

Another population that should be considered is that of mono-
cytes recruited from the blood during the post-inﬂammatory
phase. It is possible that these cells lose Ly6C expression when
in the tissue, thereby becoming Ly6C−cells that subsequently
differentiate in M2 macrophages.
MEMORY MACROPHAGES
It is long known that innate immune responses are higher to a
secondary infection/challenge, and that this higher reactive occurs
whether the new challenge is the same or different from the ﬁrst
one (cross-protection).An old example is that of mouse peritoneal
macrophages from BCG-infected mice that have little/no activ-
ity 7 days after infection, and acquire signiﬁcant citocydal activity
upon in vitro challenge with LPS or with a wealth of other stimuli,
while naïve macrophages do not (218). Recently, this phenom-
enon has been re-named trained innate immunity (219). Innate
memory plays an important defensive role in organisms lack-
ing adaptive immunity, such as plants and invertebrates, but it
is evident also in vertebrates lacking functional T and B lympho-
cytes (220). In these animals, this innate memory mechanism was
shown to involve innate immune cells with low turnover [such as
macrophages and NK cells; (221, 222)] that would be responsible
for improved pathogen recognition through pathogen recognition
receptors, and for an enhanced protective inﬂammatory response
(223, 224). NK cells could generate a memory response to viruses,
while macrophages retain memory of both bacterial and viral chal-
lenges. A logical possibility is that the microorganisms encoun-
tered by the host on a regular basis may serve to differentiating
and continually renewing a pool of memory-like macrophages
with enhanced reactivity to infectious challenges. The molecular
mechanisms responsible for shifting macrophages toward a mem-
ory status have not yet been elucidated. Putative mechanisms may
involve differences in the monocyte/macrophage population (i.e.,
CD14+ and CD16−) or changes in the expression of lectin recep-
tors on cell membrane (221), or in the functional phenotype (e.g.,
phagocytosis or protein production), but all are probably under-
lain by epigenetic reprograming that, through modiﬁcation of
DNA, post-translational modiﬁcations of histones (methylation),
or microRNA, regulates gene expression by inducing dynamic
alterations in the chromatin structure (220). Establishment of
macrophage memory, depending on the experienced challenges,
is likely to rely on epigenetic changes, as these can be at the basis
of a rapid evolution of responsiveness and adaptation to incur-
ring events, thereby allowing to surviving to new environmental
threats (220, 225). Efﬁcacy of many vaccines probably implies the
induction of non-speciﬁc macrophage memory that contributes
to the increased resistance to infections. Research in the ﬁeld of
memory macrophages needs a thorough re-assessment of a large
body of old evidence accumulated in the past decades in the areas
of macrophage activation and of adjuvanticity.
CONCLUSION
An increasing amount of evidence supports four revolutionary
concepts/discoveries on monocytes/macrophages that will force
the researcher to rewrite the books of immunology:
1. The embryonic origin of tissue-resident macrophages, which
raises the need to better understand the features/properties
of monocytes (that are no longer simple precursors of tissue
macrophages), and those of macrophages, which are capable of
self-renewal without loss of their differentiated cellular identity.
2. The capacity of monocytes/macrophages to polarize into distinct
functional phenotypes able to initiate and direct virtually all
immune responses, including adaptive ones.
3. The notion of innate memory, an old concept that has been
recently revived with the description of the so-called trained
innate immunity.
4. The importance of macrophage-mediated antigen presentation
in tissue responses, with the identiﬁcation of antigen-uptaking,
recirculating, and presenting “tissue monocytes,” and with the
notion that tissue macrophages are probably the major APC
upon a second challenge at the tissue level, without need of
recirculation to the lymph nodes.
The central role of monocytes/macrophages in this new view of
immunity implies that innate immunity has a major role in induc-
ing and modulating adaptive immunity (including the induction
of polarized T-cell responses), while on the other hand taking
advantage of adaptive immune mechanisms (e.g., T-cell-derived
cytokines) for modulating its own activity. Thus, new knowledge
on macrophage biology and functions will have a direct impact
on our understanding of immune responses and on the design
of novel therapeutic strategies. For this reason, it is necessary
to overcome several experimental obstacles that delay the full
understanding of the new dynamics and relationships within the
immune system, and that have been identiﬁed by the researchers
cited in the review.
For example, to date, transcriptome analysis of monocyte sub-
sets has been done at the basal unstimulated level, showing dra-
matic differences consistent with a different functional repertoire
for the three types of human monocytes. Circulating monocytes
are most likely “quiescent” (their quiescent status is needed in
order to avoid developing a deleterious intravascular inﬂamma-
tion), while their effector functions only develop after relocation
and activation in the tissue. Thus, the true role of the different
monocyte subsets could be only understood after activation, and
the stimulus-induced transcriptome of these cells will be required.
Further, the models of inﬂammation used to test the prolifera-
tive capacity of resident macrophages have so far been limited
to one or two rounds of tissue repopulation or relatively acute
periods of infection/inﬂammation. This obviously cannot provide
reliable information on the long-term capacity of macrophage
self-renewal. Moreover, when studying the plasticity and inter-
changeability of M1 and M2 macrophages, since mixed M1/M2
phenotypes can be found especially in pathological conditions,it is
capital to focus not only on populations but also either at the single
cell level or by lineage-tracking studies (e.g., with mice expressing
Cre ricombinase under the iNOS or arginase promoters, to track
M1 and M2 lineages, respectively). Precautions need to be taken
when drastic experimental procedures such as monocyte deple-
tion or parabiosis are used to study macrophages self-renewal.
These treatments can alter the concentration of circulating CSF-
1 and CSFR1 signaling, which are important for self-renewal of
resident macrophages under homeostatic conditions, and crit-
ical for differentiation of monocytes into tissue macrophages.

Italiani and Boraschi
Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
Likewise, precautions and appropriate controls need to be imple-
mented when using CCR2-deﬁcient mouse for studying monocyte
recruitment to the tissue, since the CCL2/CCR2 chemokine sys-
tem is also responsible of the release of monocytes from bone
marrow. Thus, the lack of recruitment of monocytes from the
blood to the tissue could be due to lack of release of monocytes
from bone marrow to the blood, where circulating monocytes are
decreased.
Our ﬁnal recommendation, therefore, is probably obvious, but
it is anyway important to state it again. We need to re-evaluate
patiently and critically a huge body of experimental evidence that
is already present in the literature. In particular, we need to over-
come the lack of consensus in deﬁning and describing the different
macrophage phenotypes (226). Many old studies have already gen-
erated information that, in light of our present knowledge, can
become very important and help us to clarify the general picture.
Second recommendation is that of designing experiments very
carefully, keeping in mind that the immune system is redundant
and that the same factor can have different activities, and that the
same activity can be carried out by different factors. Third recom-
mendation: monocytes and macrophages are never isolated in the
body, and what they do and what they become are totally inﬂu-
encedbythesurroundingcellsandtissue.Invitro systemsmayonly
partially reproduce this complexity. Last recommendation: con-
sider evolution as an incommensurable and most precious source
of information that can greatly help us understand the ontology
and behavior of monocytes and macrophages. Common mech-
anisms are many, and also species-speciﬁc differences exist, thus
we should be able to pick up the relevant common information
without, however, forgetting that human being is not a mouse or
a mosquito.
