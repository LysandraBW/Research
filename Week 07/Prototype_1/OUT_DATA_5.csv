Introduction
Macrophages are an essential component of innate immunity and 
play a central role in inflammation and host defense (1). More-
over, these cells fulfill homeostatic functions beyond defense, 
including tissue remodeling in ontogenesis and orchestration of 
metabolic functions (1–3).
Cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage are characterized by 
considerable diversity and plasticity. In tissues, mononuclear phago-
cytes respond to environmental cues (e.g., microbial products, dam-
aged cells, activated lymphocytes) with the acquisition of distinct 
functional phenotypes. In response to various signals, macrophages 
may undergo classical M1 activation (stimulated by TLR ligands and 
IFN-γ) or alternative M2 activation (stimulated by IL-4/IL-13); these 
states mirror the Th1–Th2 polarization of T cells (2, 4).
The M1 phenotype is characterized by the expression of high 
levels of proinflammatory cytokines, high production of reactive 
nitrogen and oxygen intermediates, promotion of Th1 response, 
and strong microbicidal and tumoricidal activity. In contrast, M2 
macrophages are considered to be involved in parasite containment 
and promotion of tissue remodeling and tumor progression and to 
have immunoregulatory functions. They are characterized by effi-
cient phagocytic activity, high expression of scavenging molecules, 
the expression of mannose and galactose receptors, production of 
ornithine and polyamines through the arginase pathway, and an 
IL-12loIL-10hiIL-1decoyRhiIL-1RAhi phenotype (1, 4). M1-M2 mac-
rophages also are distinct in their chemokine expression profiles.
Signals including IL-10, glucocorticoid hormones, molecules 
released from apoptotic cells, and immune complexes also pro-
foundly affect monocyte-macrophage function. These signals induce 
expression of functional phenotypes that share selected properties 
with M2 cells (e.g., high mannose and scavenger receptor expression), 
but are distinct from them, for instance, in terms of the chemokine 
repertoire. Operationally, we refer to these cells as M2 like (5).
Plasticity and flexibility are key features of mononuclear 
phagocytes and of their activation states (2, 4, 6). The pheno-
type of polarized M1-M2 macrophages can, to some extent, be 
reversed in vitro and in vivo (7, 8). Moreover, pathology is fre-
quently associated with dynamic changes in macrophage activa-
tion, with classically activated M1 cells implicated in initiating 
and sustaining inflammation and M2 or M2-like cells associ-
ated with resolution or smoldering chronic inflammation (9). 
It remains unclear whether the mechanism of these switches 
involves the recruitment of circulating precursors or the reeduca-
tion of cells in situ. However, it is now apparent that specialized 
or polarized T cells (Th1, Th2, Tregs) that are key orchestrators 
of macrophage polarized activation (2) also exhibit previously 
unsuspected flexibility and plasticity (10).
Here, we will focus on recent progress in understanding the 
molecular basis underlying macrophage polarization, including 
signaling pathways, transcription factors, and epigenetic regula-
tion. Moreover, the dynamics and limitations in our understand-
ing of polarized macrophage activation in vivo will be discussed, 
focusing on selected pathological conditions (for references to 
pathology not discussed here, see Supplemental References; sup-
plemental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/
JCI59643DS1). Previous reviews also provide a framework for 
this work (1–3, 6, 11).
Molecular determinants of macrophage polarization
A network of signaling molecules, transcription factors, epigenetic 
mechanisms, and posttranscriptional regulators underlies the dif-
ferent forms of macrophage activation. Canonical IRF/STAT sig-
naling pathways are activated by IFNs and TLR signaling to skew 
macrophage function toward the M1 phenotype (via STAT1) or by 
IL-4 and IL-13 to skew toward the M2 phenotype (via STAT6) (3). 
M1 macrophages upregulate IRF5, which is essential for induction 
of cytokines (IL-12, IL-23, TNF) involved in eliciting Th1 and Th17 
responses (12). The IL-4 type I and type II receptors (1, 13) acti-
vate Stat6, which in turn activates transcription of genes typical 
of M2 polarization, e.g., mannose receptor (Mrc1), resistin-like α

Diversity and plasticity are hallmarks of cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. In response to 
IFNs, Toll-like receptor engagement, or IL-4/IL-13 signaling, macrophages undergo M1 (classical) 
or M2 (alternative) activation, which represent extremes of a continuum in a universe of activation 
states. Progress has now been made in defining the signaling pathways, transcriptional networks, 
and epigenetic mechanisms underlying M1-M2 or M2-like polarized activation. Functional skew-
ing of mononuclear phagocytes occurs in vivo under physiological conditions (e.g., ontogenesis 
and pregnancy) and in pathology (allergic and chronic inflammation, tissue repair, infection, and 
cancer). However, in selected preclinical and clinical conditions, coexistence of cells in different activation states 
and unique or mixed phenotypes have been observed, a reflection of dynamic changes and complex tissue-derived 
signals. The identification of mechanisms and molecules associated with macrophage plasticity and polarized acti-
vation provides a basis for macrophage-centered diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

(Retnla, Fizz1), and chitinase 3–like 3 (Chi3l3, Ym1) (14). IL-10 acti-
vates STAT3-mediated expression of genes (Il10, Tgfb1, Mrc1) asso-
ciated with an M2-like phenotype (4, 15, 16).
STAT-mediated activation of macrophages is regulated by mem-
bers of the SOCS family. IL-4 and IFN-γ, the latter in concert with 
TLR stimulation, upregulate SOCS1 and SOCS3, which in turn 
inhibit the action of STAT1 and STAT3, respectively (17, 18).
Downstream of, or in parallel with, the IRF/STAT/SOCS pathway, 
a panel of transcription factors orchestrates polarized macrophage 
activation. The nuclear receptors PPARγ (19) and PPARδ (20, 21) con-
trol distinct subsets of genes associated with M2 macrophage activa-
tion and oxidative metabolism (Figure 1). Interestingly, STAT6 coor-
dinates and synergizes with both PPARγ (22) and Krüppel-like factor 4  
(KLF4), a member of a family of proteins that contribute to macro-
phage function (23, 24). KLF4 cooperates with Stat6 to induce M2 
genes (Arg-1, Mrc1, Fizz1, PPARγ) and inhibit M1 genes (TNFa, Cox-2,  
CCL5, iNOS) via sequestration of coactivators required for NF-κB acti-
vation. KLF2 regulates macrophage activation by inhibiting NF-κB/ 
HIF-1α activities (25). IL-4 also induces c-Myc activity in human 
macrophages (26), which controls genes of M2 activation (Scarb1, 
Alox15, and Mrc1) as well as STAT6 and PPARγ activation (26).
TLR engagement leads to NF-κB activation and production of 
inflammatory mediators (27) associated with M1 macrophages. 
However, NF-κB activation also activates a genetic program essen-
tial for resolution of inflammation (28) and for M2 polarization of 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) (29). Moreover, induction of 
p50 NF-κB homodimers is essential for M2 polarization in vitro and 
in vivo (30). The hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α are 
expressed differentially in M1- and M2-polarized macrophages (31) 
and regulate inducible NOS2 (M1) and arginase 1 (M2), respectively.
Figure 1
Mechanisms of macrophage polarization. The major pathways of macrophage polarization are outlined. The crosstalk between the M1-M2 macro-
phage–polarizing pathways is also indicated. The balance between activation of STAT1 and STAT3/STAT6 finely regulates macrophage polariza-
tion and activity. A predominance of NF-κB and STAT1 activation promotes M1 macrophage polarization, resulting in cytotoxic and inflammatory 
functions. In contrast, a predominance of STAT3 and STAT6 activation results in M2 macrophage polarization, associated with immune suppres-
sion and tumor progression. PPARγ and PPARδ control distinct aspects of M2 macrophage activation and oxidative metabolism. KLF4 and KLF2 
participate in the promotion of M2 macrophage functions by cooperating with STAT6 and suppressing the NF-κB/HIF-1α–dependent transcription, 
respectively. IL-4–induced c-Myc activity controls a subset of M2-associated genes. IL-4 also induces the M2-polarizing Jmjd3-IRF4 axis to inhibit 
IRF5-mediated M1 polarization. IL-10 promotes M2 polarization through the induction of p50 NF-κB homodimer, c-Maf, and STAT3 activities.

Epigenetic changes and noncoding RNAs also participate 
in directing macrophage polarization (32–34). IL-4 induces 
upregulation of the histone demethylase JMJD3 in mouse macro-
phages, which alters chromatin modifications to promote expres-
sion of M2 genes and inhibit M1 genes. miR-155 was recently iden-
tified as targeting the IL-13Rα1 subunit, thus decreasing a set of 
M2 genes in human macrophages (35).
Pathology
Resolution of inflammation and repair. Remodeling and repair occur 
dynamically during ontogenesis and inflammation, and these pro-
cesses are orchestrated by macrophages.
Macrophages undergo dynamic changes during different phases 
of wound healing. M1-polarized macrophages mediate tissue dam-
age and initiate inflammatory responses (1, 2). During the early 
stages of the repair response after wounding the skin, infiltrating 
macrophages have an M2 phenotype and their depletion inhibits 
the formation of a highly vascularized, cellular granulation tissue 
and of scar tissues (36). Under these conditions, the removal of 
apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) (37, 38) and the presence of TGF-β  
(39) may skew macrophage function, though demonstration of 
actual in vivo relevance of these findings is lacking.
In a peritoneal model of inflammation, resolution phase macro-
phages expressed a unique mixed M1-M2 phenotype, and cAMP 
was essential to restrain M1 activation (40). In humans, chronic 
venous ulcers (CVU) represent a failure to resolve a chronic inflam-
matory condition (41). Correlative analysis in patients and a 
mouse model suggested that in CVU the infiltrating macrophages 
fail to switch from an M1 to an M2 phenotype (41). Notably, iron 
metabolism is differentially regulated in polarized macrophages 
(42). In CVU, the iron overload in macrophages sustained their M1 
activation, leading to ROS-mediated DNA damage, fibroblast cel-
lular senescence, and defective tissue repair (41). It is tempting to 
speculate that similar mechanisms may underlie M2 functions in 
patients with severe burns, where hemorrhage and tissue damage, 
along with the high release of iron by M2 macrophages (42), may 
result in high iron tissue levels (43).
Dynamic changes in the phenotype of recruited mononuclear 
phagocytes have been observed in models of ischemic heart disease 
(44), suggesting that this is a general feature of the natural history of 
repair processes. In a murine model of hind limb ischemia, haplode-
ficiency of the oxygen sensor prolyl-hydroxylase PHD2 induced the 
canonical NF-κB pathway in macrophages, which promoted their 
M2 polarization and proarteriogenic phenotype (45). This obser-
vation may suggest a functional link between oxygen deprivation, 
as occurring in wounds and tumors, and progressive induction of 
proarteriogenic M2 macrophages. Thus, although the macrophage 
phenotype in resolution need not be a phenocopy of in vitro–gener-
ated M2 cells, preclinical and clinical evidence support the long-held 
view of a key role of polarized macrophages in tissue repair.
In a model of retinal neuropathy, mononuclear phagocyte infil-
tration generates a neuroprotective microenvironment promot-
ing retinal progenitor cell survival (46). The interplay of polarized 
macrophages with stem and progenitor cells is likely a key com-
ponent of their role in repair and remodeling, although the actual 
tissue-protective significance of polarized macrophages in degen-
erative diseases and their involvement with stem and progenitor 
cells remain to be determined (see Supplemental References).
Macrophage activation has been found in autoimmune and 
inflammatory diseases and in particular in lupus nephritis 
(47). In a murine model of SLE, proinflammatory activation 
of macrophages was sustained by Notch signaling (48). Con-
versely, the acute phase protein serum amyloid P (SAP) skewed 
macrophages toward an antiinflammatory M2-like phenotype, 
thus alleviating lupus nephritis (49). In RA, a major source of 
M1 cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-12p70) (50) in the joints are 
the synovial macrophages, whose number correlate with the 
inflammatory disease activity (51). On this basis, PPARδ and 
PPARγ are considered potential disease-modifying drugs for RA 
(52, 53). In a murine model of experimental colitis, recruitment 
of CCL11-expressing Ly6ChiCCR2+ inflammatory monocytes 
into the colon correlates with eosinophil infiltration and his-
topathology (54).
Infection
Bacteria. M1 macrophages are generally considered responsible for 
resistance against intracellular pathogens and characterize infec-
tion with Listeria monocytogenes (55), Salmonella typhi, and Salmo-
nella typhimurium (56), as well as the early phases of infection with 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (57), Mycobacterium ulcerans, and Myco-
bacterium avium (58, 59). Uncontrolled M1 inflammation associ-
ated with acute infections with E. coli or Streptococcus sp. causes 
gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, neonatal meningitis, and 
sepsis (60). The M1-M2 switch observed during the transition 
from acute to chronic infection may provide protection against 
overwhelming uncontrolled inflammation; however, a phenotype 
switch can also favor pathogens that have evolved strategies to 
interfere with M1-associated killing (58, 61–64).
Chronic inflammation and granuloma formation are char-
acterized by the presence of macrophages with an epithelial 
morphology and by macrophage homotypic fusion with the 
formation of multinucleated giant cells (MNG) (65). IL-4–medi-
ated upregulation of E-cadherin, which engages in intercellular 
homotypic adhesion, is likely to underlie MNG formation. STAT6 
drives expression of E-cadherin and DC transmembrane protein 
(DC-STAMP; ref. 66) during MNG generation. The actual func-
tion and role of MNG remain elusive.
Parasites. In experimental and human parasite infections, macro-
phages generally undergo a dynamic switch toward M2 polariza-
tion (61, 67). The early and late phases of Taenia crassiceps infection 
are characterized by Th1-driven M1 and Th2-driven IL-4–mediat-
ed M2 polarization of macrophages, respectively (11, 68). A simi-
lar M1-M2 switch has been reported during Schistosoma mansoni 
and Trypanosoma congolense infection (69). In the chronic stage of 
T. crassiceps infection, the p50 NF-κB subunit (see above) promotes 
protective M2 macrophage polarization associated with decreased 
parasite burden (30).
The recurrent association of M2 polarization with parasite infec-
tions does not necessarily imply a generalized relevance in patho-
genesis. For instance, lineage-selective ablation of the IL-4α chain 
causes a dramatic increase in susceptibility to S. mansoni, but has 
no discernible effect on Nippostrongylus infection (70).
Viral infections. Polarized activation of macrophages has been 
associated with virus infection (e.g., HIV, Kaposi sarcoma–associ-
ated herpes virus, and others; see Supplemental References), and 
this polarization may be important in containing and limiting 
tissue damage. In particular, during severe respiratory syncytial 
virus–induced (RSV-induced) bronchiolitis, IL-4Rα/STAT6-
dependent M2 macrophage differentiation reduces inflammation 
and epithelial damage in lungs (71).

Allergy
Allergy is driven by Th2 cells and products and is associated with 
M2 polarization of macrophages (72, 73). IL-4–inducible che-
mokines acting on CCR4 (e.g., CCL22) have also been reported 
to promote skewing of macrophage function (74). Evidence now 
indicates that chitin- and arginase-dependent M2 pathways play 
an active role in pathogenesis (75, 76). Asthma is associated with 
tissue remodeling, including collagen deposition and goblet cell 
hyperplasia. IL-4–driven M2 polarization is likely to play a key role 
as an orchestrator of these processes (77).
Allergy represents a paradigm for IL-4/IL-13–driven type 2 
inflammation. However, there is evidence that the inflamma-
some/IL-1/Th17 pathway can also drive allergic inflammation 
(78, 79). Moreover, a Th1-associated cytokine, IL-18, has also 
been implicated in allergic inflammation (80). It is therefore per-
haps not surprising that mixed phenotype macrophages have 
been observed (81).
Cancer
Cancer-related inflammation is characterized by the recruitment 
of cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage to tumor tissues 
(2, 82, 83), which also condition the premetastatic niche, to 
favor secondary localization of cancer. Classically activated M1-
polarized macrophages have the potential to exhibit antitumor 
activity and to elicit tumor tissue disruption (4). At least in some 
models of carcinogenesis in the mouse, progression is associated 
with a phenotype switch from M1 to M2 (84). Th1-driven mac-
rophage activation was found to mediate elimination of senes-
cent hepatocytes, which drive subsequent carcinogenesis (85). 
It is therefore likely that classically activated M1 macrophages 
contribute to the T cell–mediated elimination and equilibrium 
phases during tumor progression (86).
At later stages of progression in mice and humans, TAMs gener-
ally have an M2-like phenotype with low IL-12 expression, high IL-10  
expression, and low tumoricidal activity and promotion of tissue 
remodeling and angiogenesis. TAM infiltration is generally associ-
ated with poor prognosis, as shown in Hodgkin disease, glioma, chol-
angiocarcinoma, and breast carcinoma (87, 88). However, TAMs with 
various functional states can coexist in the same tumor (2, 89). Vari-
ous pathways orchestrate the protumor function of myelomonocytic 
cells, including tumor-derived and host-derived signals (2). Lympho-
cytes are key orchestrators of TAM function (2), but pathways differ 
in tumors originating in different organs. For instance, skewing of 
macrophage function was found to be mediated by IL-4–producing 
Th2 cells in skin (90, 91) and by antibody-producing B cells in breast 
carcinogenesis (92, 93). B1 cells can promote cancer progression in 
the skin (5), and fibroblasts can also contribute to circuits driving 
macrophage polarization and tumor promotion (94).
Tumor cell products, including extracellular matrix compo-
nents, IL-10, CSF-1, and chemokines (CCL2, CCL18, CCL17, and 
CXCL4), set macrophages in an M2-like, cancer-promoting mode 
(82, 95–97). TAMs can also interact with and promote the tumori-
genicity of cancer stem cells (CSCs) via production of the milk-fat 
globule-epidermal growth factor–VIII (MFG-E8) by activation of 
the STAT3 and sonic hedgehog pathways (98).
The identification of the various cellular and molecular path-
ways that participate in inflammation in different human cancers 
will be required to translate our understanding of cancer-related 
inflammation to meaningful therapeutic advances.
Obesity and metabolism
Obesity-associated insulin resistance, diabetes, and metabolic 
syndrome are sustained by chronic subclinical inflammation 
(99). Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are a major component

of adipose tissue and are important players in obesity-associated 
pathology. In obese subjects and mice, adipocytes release media-
tors such as CCL2, TNF, or free fatty acids, which promote the 
recruitment and activation of ATMs (100–102). In turn, ATM-pro-
duced inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF, IL-6, IL-1β) counteract 
the insulin-sensitizing action of adiponectin and leptin, leading to 
insulin resistance. ATM infiltration correlates with the degree of 
obesity (101–103). ATM accumulation is orchestrated by selected 
chemokines and their receptors (e.g., CCL2/CCR2 or CCL5/CCR5) 
(101, 103, 104) and by the macrophage-derived apoptosis inhibitor 
of macrophages (AIM) (105).
ATMs from obese mice and humans are polarized toward an 
M1 phenotype, with upregulation of TNF and iNOS. In con-
trast “lean” ATMs express high levels of M2 genes, including 
IL-10, Ym1, and Arginase 1 (106, 107). Weight loss is associ-
ated with a shift back to an M2-like phenotype. However, evi-
dence indicates that the ATM population in obese patients is 
diverse, with a minor F4/80+CD11b+CD11c–, IL-10hi, M2-like 
population coexisting with M1 cells (106). Moreover, analysis 
of CD11c+ ATMs from obese mice revealed a mixed profile of 
several M1-M2 gene transcripts (108). Weight loss is associ-
ated with an increase in F4/80+CD11c–CD301+ M2-like macro-
phages, which promote lipolysis (109).
Progress has been made in defining the molecular pathways that 
account for polarization of ATMs (19, 20, 24, 110, 111) in obesity. 
Mice with macrophage-selective genetic inactivation of PPARγ, 
PPARδ, and KLF4 show inhibition of obesity-induced insulin 
resistance (19, 20, 24, 106, 110), although these results may be 
strain specific (112). The adipose tissue of obese subjects shows a 
marked reduction in KLF4 levels. Nguyen et al. have recently dem-
onstrated that adaptation to lower temperatures (thermogenesis) 
is associated with polarization of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and 
white adipose tissue (WAT) macrophages to the alternative state 
(M2), with increased expression of thermogenic genes (Ppargc1 
and Ucp1) (113). In response to cold, IL-4–driven M2 macrophages 
release noradrenaline in BAT and WAT, which coordinates fatty 
acid mobilization and energy expenditure (113). Although further 
work is needed to dissect the diversity and dynamics of ATMs,  
M2-like cells in nonobese individuals are likely involved in main-
taining adipose tissue homeostasis, preventing inflammation, and 
promoting insulin sensitivity. In contrast, M1-like ATMs drive 
obesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance (107). The 
role of macrophages in obesity and associated disorders underlines 
a homeostatic function of macrophages in metabolism as cells 
capable of reorienting their own metabolic activity and as orches-
trators of general metabolism.

Therapeutic targets in polarized inflammation
Specific macrophage-targeted therapies are now taking the first 
steps into the clinical arena (Table 1). In addition, therapeutic 
approaches not originally designed as macrophage oriented or spe-
cific have been found to affect macrophage activation and polar-
ization. These off-target examples provide insights and lessons for 
the development of more specifically directed approaches.
Recruitment is a key determinant sustaining macrophage 
numbers at sites of inflammation and immunity. Monocyte 
attractants include members of the chemokine superfamily, 
CCL2/MCP-1 in particular, and growth factors interacting with 
tyrosine kinase receptors CSF-1 and VEGF (83, 114, 115). CSF-1 
receptor (c-fms) kinase inhibitors have been generated, and these 
molecules exhibit antiangiogenic and antimetastatic activity in 
acute myeloid leukemia and melanoma models (116, 117). Che-
mokines and CSF-1 are more than monocyte attractants; they 
also promote M2-like skewing of macrophage function (97, 
118, 119). Antibodies directed against CCL2/CCR2 have proven 
active in prostate and breast cancer (83, 120). A CCL2 inhibitor 
(bindarit) has proven active in preclinical models of cancer and 
vascular pathology, resulting in inhibition of monocyte recruit-
ment (121); this agent is now undergoing evaluation for clinical 
use. Anti–CSF-1 antibodies and antisense oligonucleotides sup-
press macrophage infiltration and xenograft mammary tumor 
growth in mice (122–124). VEGF inhibitors can decrease macro-
phage recruitment, and this effect may contribute to their anti-
angiogenic activity (125). In contrast, in response to neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, altered composition in the immune microenvi-
ronment was found in breast cancer patients, with increased per-
centage of infiltrating myeloid cells (126).
Recent results suggest that in situ, proliferation is a key deter-
minant of macrophage accumulation during inflammation in 
the peritoneum and lungs (127, 128). In the latter, IL-4 was found 
to sustain macrophage proliferation. If proliferation is indeed a 
major general mechanism sustaining macrophage accumulation, 
this may suggest novel approaches to reduce macrophage numbers 
in situ and a different perspective for anti–CSF-1/CSF-1R strate-
gies. However, determining the actual significance of macrophage 
proliferation in humans, in particular in Th2-mediated inflamma-
tion, is a major stumbling block in this perspective.
Reorienting and reshaping deranged macrophage polarization 
is the holy grail of macrophage therapeutic targeting (129). Polar-
ized phenotypes are reversible in vitro and in vivo (29, 130–132). 
In proof of concept and in a large clinical study in ovarian cancer 
patients, IFN-γ was found to activate TAM tumoricidal activity, 
inducing a phenotype switch with unequivocal evidence of clinical 
responses (133). In a model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 
CD40 agonist antibodies promoted a remarkable antitumor effect 
and induced high expression of M1 markers (MHC class II and 
CD86) in macrophages (132).
Modulation of macrophage function is an off-target effect for 
a number of diverse therapeutic agents. PPARγ agonists (thia-
zolidinediones) have long been used in the treatment of diabetes. 
The evidence linking PPARγ to M2 polarization and hence to the 
homeostatic role of ATMs sheds fresh new light on their mode 
of action. Preclinical evidence suggests that PPARγ promotes  
M2-like polarization and homeostatic metabolic function in ATMs 
and that alteration of this function is a key pathogenic feature in 
diabetes (134–136). Other therapeutic strategies that have been 
reported to affect macrophage polarization include zoledronic 
acid (an agent used for preventing recurrence of breast cancer bone 
metastasis), statins (137), trabectedin (138) and TLR ligands (e.g., 
imiquimod and CpG) (see also Supplemental References).
Concluding remarks
Progress has been made in defining the molecular networks 
underlying polarized activation of macrophages. Molecular 
determinants of M1 versus M2 polarization include members 
of the PPAR, KLF, IRF, STAT, NF-κB, and HIF families. Regu-
lation of skewing also involves epigenetic modifications with 
involvement of histone methylation and acetylation. miRNAs 
have emerged as regulators of phagocyte activation and function 
(34, 139), but their role in macrophage polarization needs to be 
further defined.
Functional polarization has now been observed in vivo under 
physiological and pathological conditions. The former include 
embryogenesis and pregnancy and normal maintenance of select-
ed tissues, such as testis and adipose. The latter include chronic 
inflammation and tissue repair, metabolic and vascular disorders, 
infection, and cancer. There is now evidence that macrophages are 
a key component of all of these processes (Figure 2).
Under condition such as parasite infections, allergy, and many 
cancers, the functional phenotypes of macrophages in vivo mirror 
those of canonical M1-M2 or M2-like polarized states as defined 
in vitro. However, in a number of pathological conditions, such as 
neurodegenerative disorders (140), this is not the case, and macro-
phage populations express mixed or unique phenotypes. The con-
tribution of coexisting cells with different phenotypes, the impact 
of dynamic changes during disease evolution, and the molecular 
networks orchestrating these mixed phenotypes need to be carefully 
dissected on a case-by-case basis. Indeed, this macrophage plasticity 
calls for in-depth analysis in different pathological conditions.
Therapeutic macrophage targeting is in its infancy. Selected 
clinically approved therapeutic strategies, such as use of PPARγ 
inhibitors, statins, zolendronic acid, and preventive activities such 
as weight loss may have an impact on the functional status of 
macrophages; however, the extent to which their effect on mac-
rophages explains their clinical efficacy remains to be defined. 
The identification of mechanisms and molecules associated with 
macrophage plasticity and polarized activation provides a basis for 
macrophage-centered diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

Experiences, whether they be learning in a classroom, a stressful event, or ingestion of a psychoactive substance, impact the
brain by modifying the activity and organization of specific neural circuitry. A major mechanism by which the neural activity
generated by an experience modifies brain function is via modifications of synaptic transmission; that is, synaptic plasticity.
Here, we review current understanding of the mechanisms of the major forms of synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses in
the mammalian brain. We also provide examples of the possible developmental and behavioral functions of synaptic plasticity
and how maladaptive synaptic plasticity may contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders.

INTRODUCTION
One of the most important and fascinating properties of the
mammalian brain is its plasticity; the capacity of the neural
activity generated by an experience to modify neural circuit
function and thereby modify subsequent thoughts, feelings,
and behavior. Synaptic plasticity specifically refers to the
activity-dependent modification of the strength or efficacy
of synaptic transmission at preexisting synapses, and for
over a century has been proposed to play a central role in
the capacity of the brain to incorporate transient experi-
ences into persistent memory traces. Synaptic plasticity is
also thought to play key roles in the early development of
neural circuitry and evidence is accumulating that impair-
ments in synaptic plasticity mechanisms contribute to
several prominent neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, eluci-
dating the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying
synaptic plasticity in any number of different brain regions
is critical for understanding the neural basis of many
aspects of normal and pathological brain function.
Given the diversity of the functions ascribed to synaptic
plasticity, it is not surprising that many forms and
mechanisms of synaptic plasticity have been described.
Synaptic transmission can be either enhanced or depressed
by activity, and these changes span temporal domains
ranging from milliseconds to hours, days, and presumably
even longer. Furthermore, virtually all excitatory synapses
in the mammalian brain simultaneously express a number
of different forms of synaptic plasticity. Here, we attempt to
provide a broad overview of the mechanisms of the most
prominent
forms
of
plasticity
observed
at
excitatory
synapses in the mammalian brain. After briefly reviewing
short-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity, we will emphasize
current understanding of the cellular mechanisms and
possible functions of the class of phenomena commonly
termed long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depres-
sion (LTD).
SHORT-TERM SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY
Numerous forms of short-term synaptic plasticity, lasting
on the order of milliseconds to several minutes, have been
observed at virtually every synapse examined in organisms
ranging from simple invertebrates to mammals (Zucker and
Regehr, 2002). These are thought to play important roles in
short-term adaptations to sensory inputs, transient changes
in behavioral states, and short-lasting forms of memory.
Most forms of short-term synaptic plasticity are triggered
by short bursts of activity causing a transient accumulation
of calcium in presynaptic nerve terminals. This increase in
presynaptic
calcium
in
turn
causes
changes
in
the
probability of neurotransmitter release by directly modify-
ing the biochemical processes that underlie the exocytosis
of synaptic vesicles.
Paired-Pulse Facilitation and Depression
When two stimuli are delivered within a short interval, the
response to the second stimulus can be either enhanced or

depressed relative to the response to the first stimulus (Katz
and Miledi, 1968; Zucker and Regehr, 2002). Paired-pulse
depression is commonly observed at all synapses at short
(less than 20 ms) interstimulus intervals, and most probably
results from inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium or
calcium channels or from a transient depletion of the
release-ready pool of vesicles docked at the presynaptic
terminal. Many synapses exhibit paired-pulse facilitation at
longer
interstimulus
intervals
(20–500 ms).
A
simple
explanation for this phenomenon is that the residual
calcium left over from the invasion of the first action
potential contributes to additional release during the second
stimulation, but it is likely that additional mechanisms are
involved. These may involve activation of protein kinases
that modulate the activity of presynaptic phosphoproteins.
For example, mice in which the presynaptic phosphoprotein
synapsin (De Camilli et al, 1990) has been knocked out,
exhibit abnormal short-term plasticity (Rosahl et al, 1993,
1995).
Whether a synapse exhibits paired-pulse facilitation or
depression depends on the recent history of activation of
the synapse. Because these forms of plasticity largely result
from changes in the probability of transmitter release (p),
synapses that begin with a very high p tend to depress their
response to the second pulse (Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997).
In contrast, synapses with a low initial p normally exhibit an
increase in p in response to the second stimulus. Consistent
with this idea, manipulations that decrease p (eg, activation
of presynaptic autoreceptors) almost always cause an
increase in the magnitude of paired-pulse facilitation, or
even a conversion of paired-pulse depression to facilitation.
Thus, the same synapse can display either facilitation or
depression, depending on its recent history of activation
and modulation.
Facilitation and Depression Following Trains of
Stimuli
Longer-lasting forms of plasticity are observed following
repetitive or tetanic stimulation of synapses with prolonged
(approximately 200 ms to 5 s) trains of stimulation applied
at high frequencies (10–200 Hz) (Zucker and Regehr, 2002).
Augmentation and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) describe
an enhancement of transmitter release lasting from seconds
(augmentation) to several minutes (PTP). They also involve
an increase in the probability of transmitter release in
response to an action potential due, in large part, to the
buildup
of
calcium
concentration
in
the
presynaptic
terminal during the stimulus trains. This residual calcium
may combine with the calcium influx elicited by the
subsequent single action potential to enhance directly the
release of neurotransmitter, or may lead to biochemical
modifications of proteins in the presynaptic terminal
(Magleby and Zengel, 1982; Zucker and Regehr, 2002).
At some synapses, repetitive activation leads to depres-
sion that can last for several seconds or even minutes (Betz,
1970; Zucker and Regehr, 2002). As in paired-pulse
depression, this generally occurs in synapses that exhibit a
high probability of release, and is thought to result, at least
in part, from a transient depletion of the release-ready pool
of synaptic vesicles. The decrease in synaptic strength can
also arise from the release of modulatory substances from
the activated presynaptic terminals, postsynaptic cells, or
even neighboring cells, initiating a signaling cascade that
leads to inhibition of the presynaptic release machinery.
Finally, a postsynaptic mechanism of short-term plasticity
may involve desensitization of ligand-gated receptors,
making the target neuron less sensitive to neurotransmitter.
A key characteristic of depression at many synapses is use
dependence. Higher levels of transmission are associated
with larger depression, and reduction of baseline transmis-
sion (eg, by reducing external calcium concentration)
relieves depression.
Modulation of Transmission by Presynaptic
Receptors
Most presynaptic terminals possess a number of different
types of metabotropic G-protein-coupled receptors, as well
as ionotropic receptors (MacDermott et al, 1999). The
probability of transmitter release, a significant factor in
defining synaptic strength, is controlled in part by the
occupancy of these receptors, which in turn is set by the
extracellular concentrations of their agonists. In some cases,
tonic levels of endogenous ligands are sufficient to partially
activate the receptors. Nonetheless, synaptic activity can
further increase receptor occupancy by transiently elevating
the concentration of various presynaptic neuromodulators
(Thompson et al, 1993; Miller, 1998). Depending on their
specific properties, activation of these receptors can either
enhance or depress synaptic transmission.
Via the release of a number of different neuromodulators,
postsynaptic
cells
can
also
influence
the
release
of
transmitter from presynaptic terminals. A common scenar-
io is that in response to strong postsynaptic depolarization,
dendrites release retrograde messengers that act through G-
protein-coupled receptors located on presynaptic terminals
to influence neurotransmitter release. Retrograde messen-
gers that have been identified in specific cell types include
dopamine, dynorphin, glutamate, GABA, nitric oxide,
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and oxytocin
(Drake et al, 1994; Kombian et al, 1997; Llano et al, 1991;
Naggapan and Lu, 2005; Nugent et al, 2007; Pitler and Alger,
1992; Zilberter, 2000; Zilberter et al, 1999). Although
postsynaptic, calcium-dependent fusion of vesicles is one
common mechanism for the release of retrograde messen-
gers, they can also released by non-vesicular mechanisms.
For example, a widespread, extensively studied system for
mediating retrograde synaptic signaling involves the post-
synaptic release of endogenous cannabinoids, such as
anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, which are pro-
duced upon demand by cleavage of phospholipids and are
sensed by CB1 receptors on presynaptic terminals. The
mechanisms of endocannabinoid release are unclear and
may involve a transporter, which facilitates diffusion across
the plasma membrane (Chevaleyre et al, 2006) Such
retrograde signaling by postsynaptic release of endocanna-
binoids can be initiated by strong depolarization or
activation of postsynaptic metabotropic receptors and has
been shown to transiently suppress inhibitory and excita-
tory synapses in several brain regions (Chevaleyre et al,
2006). Importantly, in the striatum, there is a form of LTD
(to be discussed below) that is triggered by the release of
endocannabinoids.

Involvement of Glia in Short-Term Plasticity
There is growing realization that glia may be involved in
some forms of short-term plasticity (Araque et al, 2001;
Haydon,
2001).
With
their
intimate
association
with
synapses, astrocytes and perisynaptic Schwann cells are
well
positioned
to
regulate
synapses.
They
have
an
established role in clearance of neurotransmitter and may
participate in synaptic plasticity by controlling the speed
and extent of such clearance (Bergles et al, 1999; Danbolt,
2001). This can in turn impact on the degree of postsynaptic
receptor activation and desensitization. Another way that
glia may be involved in synaptic plasticity is by sensing
extracellular messengers and then releasing substances that
in turn can directly affect synaptic efficacy (Araque et al,
2001; Haydon, 2001). For example, glia express many
different neurotransmitter receptors (eg, glutamate recep-
tors), which when activated result in the release of
substances (eg, ATP) that can then act on presynaptic
terminals to regulate neurotransmitter release.
Functions of Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity
Short-term synaptic plasticity was originally established as
behaviorally important from studies of simple organisms
such as Aplysia (Kandel and Tauc, 1965). In the mammalian
brain, an important consequence of short-term synaptic
plasticity
is
to
influence
the
information
processing
function of synapses, enabling them to act as filters with a
wide range of properties. For example, synapses with a low
initial probability of release function as high-pass filters,
since they will facilitate during high-frequency action
potential bursts while low-frequency bursts will not be
transmitted with the same efficacy. In contrast, synapses
with a high initial probability of release function as low-pass
filters, since they will depress during high-frequency bursts
but will reliably relay low-frequency activity (Abbott and
Regehr, 2004). The filtering characteristics of a synapse can
be adjusted through modulation of the initial release
probability. This most commonly occurs due to the release
of neuromodulators that, via activation of presynaptic
receptors, reduce the probability of release. This changes
the filtering characteristics of the synapse, causing facilita-
tion to become predominant over depression. In this way,
presynaptic inhibition can convert a synapse from a low-
pass to a high-pass filter.
LONG-TERM SYNAPTIC PLASTICIY
It is widely believed that experience of any sort modifies
subsequent behavior at least in part through activity-
dependent, long-lasting modifications of synaptic strength.
The brain encodes external and internal events as complex,
spatio-temporal patterns of activity in large ensembles
of neurons that can be conceptualized as ‘neural circuits’.
A key feature defining the behavior of any given neural
circuit is the pattern of synaptic weights that connect
the individual neurons that comprise the circuit. A corollary
to this hypothesis is that new information is stored
(ie, memories are generated) when activity in a circuit
causes a long-lasting change in the pattern of synaptic
weights. This idea was put forward over 100 years ago
by the Spanish Nobel laureate Santiago Ramon y Cajal,
and was further advanced in the late 1940s by Donald
Hebb,
who
proposed
that
associative
memories
are
formed in the brain by a process of synaptic modification
that strengthens connections when presynaptic activity
correlates with postsynaptic firing (Hebb, 1949). This
proposed
function
for
synaptic
plasticity,
forming
a
memory trace following the detection of two coincident
events, suggests an appealing cellular basis for behavioral
phenomena
such
as
Pavlovian
classical
conditioning
(Pavlov, 1927).
Experimental support for the very existence of such
long-lasting,
activity-dependent
changes
in
synaptic
strength was lacking until the early 1970s when Bliss
and colleagues (Bliss and Gardner-Medwin, 1973; Bliss
and Lomo, 1973) reported that repetitive activation of
excitatory synapses in the hippocampus caused a potentia-
tion of synaptic strength that could last for hours or even
days. Over the last three decades, this phenomenon,
eventually termed LTP, has been the object of intense
investigation because it is widely believed that it provides an
important key to understanding some of the cellular and
molecular mechanisms by which memories are formed
(Martin et al, 2000; Pastalkova et al, 2006; Whitlock et al,
2006).
Although still considered prototypic, it is now clear that
hippocampal LTP is only one of several different forms of
long-term synaptic plasticity that exist in specific circuits in
the mammalian brain. Importantly, it is well established
that most synapses that exhibit LTP also express one or
more forms of LTD. Thus, a key concept is that synaptic
strength at excitatory synapses is bidirectionally modifiable
by different patterns of activity. Furthermore, it is now clear
that the terms ‘LTP’ and ‘LTD’ describe a class of
phenomena, the underlying mechanisms of which vary
depending on the circuits in which they function.
Additional forms of synaptic plasticity more recently
identified
include
homeostatic
plasticity
(Turrigiano
and
Nelson,
2004) and
metaplasticity
(Abraham
and
Bear, 1996). The major form of homeostatic plasticity is
‘synaptic scaling’, which describes phenomena whereby
the strength of all synapses on a given cell are adjusted in
response to prolonged changes in activity. Specifically,
prolonged decreases in overall activity cause a net scaling
up of total synaptic strengths while prolonged increases in
activity cause the opposite, a scaling down of synaptic
strengths. This form of plasticity operates on a much
slower timescale than LTP or LTD and may be parti-
cularly
important
during
the
development
of
neural
circuits. Metaplasticity refers to the effects that activity
can have on the capacity of synapses to express long-term
plasticity.
The most extensively studied and therefore prototypic
forms of synaptic plasticity are the LTP and LTD observed
in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (Figure 1), which are
triggered by activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptors (NMDARs). We will therefore begin with a
discussion of their underlying mechanisms. We will then
proceed to reviewing some of the other prominent forms of
LTP and LTD for which mechanisms have been most firmly
established.

NMDAR-Dependent LTP
No form of plasticity has generated more interest, or been
more extensively studied than LTP in the CA1 region of the
hippocampus. The excitement surrounding this phenom-
enon is due to compelling evidence from rodents, primates,
and humans associating the hippocampus with a neural
system involved in various forms of long-term memory
(Martin et al, 2000; Zola-Morgan and Squire, 1993).
Furthermore, several basic properties of LTP make it an
attractive cellular mechanism for rapid information storage.
Similar to memory, LTP can be generated rapidly and is
strengthened and prolonged by repetition. It also exhibits
cooperativity, associativity, and input specificity. (Nicoll
et al, 1988). Cooperativity means that LTP can be induced
by the coincident activation of a critical number of
synapses. Associativity is the capacity to potentiate a weak
input (a small number of synapses) when it is activated in
association with a strong input (a larger number of
synapses). As such, associativity is a cellular analogue of
classical conditioning and is an implicit property of the so-
called Hebbian synapse. Input specificity indicates that LTP
is elicited only at activated synapses and not at adjacent,
inactive synapses on the same postsynaptic cell. This feature
dramatically increases the storage capacity of individual
neurons since different synapses on the same cell can be
involved in separate circuits encoding different bits of
information.
A major technological advance in the study of synaptic
plasticity was the development of the hippocampal slice
preparation that made LTP accessible to rigorous experi-
mental analysis (Figure 1b). Indeed, the bulk of our
knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of LTP has been
derived from studies of LTP at excitatory synapses on CA1
pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices. Similar or
identical forms of LTP have been observed at excitatory
synapses throughout the brain. Thus, the conclusions drawn
from the study of LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region are
often applied to other brain regions.
Triggering NMDAR-dependent LTP. A major advance in
the understanding of excitatory synaptic function and LTP
was the demonstration that two major types of ionotropic
glutamate receptors contribute to the postsynaptic response
at glutamatergic synapses, a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-
isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors (AMPARs) and
NMDARs (Figure 1c). These receptors are often (although
not always, as will be elaborated upon later) found

NMDAR-dependent LTP and LTD at hippocampal CA1 synapses. (a) Sample experiments illustrating LTP and LTD in the CA1 region of the
hippocampus. Synaptic strength, defined as the initial slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP; normalized to baseline) is plotted as a
function of time. Left panel demonstrates LTP elicited by high-frequency tetanic stimulation (100 Hz stimulation for 1 s; black arrowhead). Right panel
illustrates LTD elicited by low-frequency stimulation (5 Hz stimulation for 3 min given twice with a 3 min interval; open arrow). Data traces were taken at the
times indicated by the numbers on the graphs (scale bar: 0.5 mV; 10 ms) (courtesy of W Morishita). (b) A schematic diagram of the rodent hippocampal slice

placements for studying synaptic plasticity at Schaffer collateral synapses onto CA1 neurons are indicated (Stim ¼ stimulating electrode; Rec ¼ recording
electrode). (c) Model of synaptic transmission at excitatory synapses. During basal synaptic transmission (left panel), synaptically released glutamate binds
both the NMDA and AMPARs. Na + flows through the AMPAR channel but not through the NMDAR channel because of the Mg2 + block of this channel.
Depolarization of the postsynaptic cell (right) relieves the Mg2 + block of the NMDAR channel and allows both Na + and Ca2 + to flow into the dendritic
spine. The resultant increase in Ca2 + in the dendritic spine is necessary for triggering the subsequent events that drive synaptic plasticity.

colocalized on individual dendritic spines. The AMPAR has
a channel that is permeable to monovalent cations (Na +
and K +), and activation of AMPARs provides most of the
inward current that generates the excitatory synaptic
response when the cell is close to its resting membrane
potential. In contrast to AMPARs, the NMDAR exhibits a
strong voltage dependence because of the block of its
channel at negative membrane potentials by extracellular
magnesium (Mayer et al, 1984; Nowak et al, 1984). As a
result,
NMDARs
contribute
little
to
the
postsynaptic
response during basal synaptic activity. However, when
the cell is depolarized, magnesium dissociates from its
binding site within the NMDAR channel, allowing ions to
enter the cell. Importantly, unlike AMPAR channels, the
NMDAR channel allows calcium as well as sodium to enter
the postsynaptic dendritic spine (Figure 1c).
It is firmly established that the triggering (also termed the
induction) of LTP in the CA1 region requires activation of
NMDARs during strong postsynaptic depolarization leading
to
a
increase
in
postsynaptic
calcium
concentration,
which likely has to reach some critical threshold value to
activate the biochemical processes necessary for LTP
(Malenka, 1991; Malenka and Nicoll, 1993). Experimentally,
this is normally achieved by applying high-frequency
tetanic stimulation to the synapses or by use of a ‘pairing-
protocol’ during which the postsynaptic cell is directly
depolarized while low-frequency synaptic activation is
sustained. An additional method for induction of LTP (as
well as LTD) involves protocols that generate so-called
‘spike-time dependent plasticity’ (STDP; Dan and Poo, 2006;
Markram et al, 1997). In studies of STDP, LTP is induced
if afferent stimulation generates a synaptic response within
a
discrete
time
window
prior
to
the
firing
of
the
postsynaptic cell.
Because its contribution to postsynaptic reponses re-
quires both presynaptic release of glutamate and post-
synaptic depolarization due to the simultaneous activation
of a population of synapses, the NMDAR is often referred to
as a ‘coincidence detector’. These properties of NMDARs
also explain the basic properties of LTP. Cooperativity and
associativity occur because of the requirement for multiple
synapses
to
be
activated
simultaneously
to
generate
adequate postsynaptic depolarization to remove the mag-
nesium block of the NMDAR. Input specificity is due to the
compartmentalized increase in calcium, which is limited to
the postsynaptic dendritic spine and does not influence
adjacent spines (Nicoll et al, 1988).
LTP
signal
transduction
mechanisms.
An
extensive
number
of
signal
transduction
molecules
have
been
suggested to play a role in translating the calcium signal
that is required to trigger LTP into the long-lasting increase
in synaptic strength (Malenka and Bear, 2004; Sanes and
Lichtman, 1999). However, only for a handful of these has
compelling evidence of a mandatory role in LTP been
presented. A major limitation of much of the literature on
this topic stems from inadequate distinctions between
molecules that are key components of the molecular
machinery directly responsible for the triggering of LTP
(‘mediators’), and those molecules which may modulate
the ability to generate LTP, or play a permissive role
(‘modulators’). Some basic criteria that can be suggested for
defining the role of a protein as a mediator of LTP induction
are: (1) blocking the activation of the molecule during LTP
induction blocks LTP; and (2) activation of the molecule
induces a potentiation of synaptic transmission, which
occludes further synaptic induction of LTP.
Strong
evidence
indicates
that
calcium/calmodulin
(CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) fulfills these
requirements and is a key component of the molecular
machinery for LTP. CaMKII undergoes autophosphoryla-
tion after the triggering of LTP (Barria et al, 1997; Fukunaga
et al, 1995), and LTP induction was prevented both in
knockout mice lacking a critical CaMKII subunit (Silva
et al, 1992), and in knock-in animals in which endogenous
CaMKII was replaced with a form lacking the autopho-
sphorylation site (Giese et al, 1998). Furthermore, inhibition
of CaMKII activity by directly loading postsynaptic cells
with peptides that impair CaMKII function blocks LTP
(Malenka et al, 1989; Malinow et al, 1989), whereas acutely
increasing the postsynaptic concentration of active CaMKII
increases synaptic strength and occludes LTP (Lledo et al,
1995; Pettit et al, 1994).
Several other kinases have been implicated in the
triggering of LTP, but the experimental evidence supporting
their role is not as well substantiated as that for CaMKII.
Activation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-depen-
dent protein kinase (PKA), perhaps by the activation of a
calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase, has been suggested
to boost the activity of CaMKII indirectly by decreasing
competing protein phosphatase activity (Blitzer et al, 1998;
Lisman, 1989; Makhinson et al, 1999). This presumably
happens by phosphorylation of inhibitor 1, an endogenous
inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). The extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
(Erk)/mitogen-activated
protein
kinase (MAPK) pathway has also been suggested to be
important for LTP, as well as some forms of learning and
memory (Sweatt, 2004; Thomas and Huganir, 2004). In
addition, Src kinase has been implicated in the enhance-
ment of NMDAR function during LTP induction (Kalia
et al, 2004). Finally, protein kinase C and in particular the
atypical
PKC
isozyme,
PKMz,
has
received
attention
because this isozyme is rapidly expressed upon induction
of LTP and recent studies have implicated PKMz in the
maintenance of the late phase of LTP both in hippocampal
slices and in vivo (Hrabetova and Sacktor, 1996; Ling et al,
2002; Pastalkova et al, 2006; Serrano et al, 2005).
Obviously, it remains a very challenging task to be able to
definitively identify the key intracellular signaling cascades
responsible for the triggering of LTP. Recent technical
advances in mass spectrometric techniques for the profiling
of post-transcriptional modifications in mixed populations
of proteins, as well as the practicality of RNAi approaches
for knockdown of candidate proteins, should help further
characterize the major LTP players and their dynamic
interplay.
Expression mechanisms of LTP. In the past, a major point
of contention was whether LTP was primarily expressed
postsynaptically as a change in AMPAR properties or
presynaptically, as a change in the probability of transmitter
release. This latter expression mechanism garnered sig-
nificant attention because it required the production of a
retrograde messenger that was released by postsynaptic

cells and acted on presynaptic terminals (for a thorough
review of the evidence for either locus of expression, see
Nicoll, 2003). To a large extent, this controversy has been
resolved, with the emerging consensus that the major
mechanism of expression of LTP at hippocampal CA1
synapses involves an increase in the numbers of AMPARs
within the postsynaptic density, driven through activity-
dependent changes in AMPAR trafficking (Bredt and Nicoll,
2003; Derkach et al, 2007; Malenka and Nicoll, 1999;
Malinow and Malenka, 2002; Song and Huganir, 2002).
A major contribution to ending the controversy was the
proposal of the silent synapse hypothesis and the evidence
supporting it (Durand et al, 1996; Isaac et al, 1995; Liao
et al, 1995; Malenka and Nicoll, 1997). Silent synapses are
synapses that contain only NMDARs with few or no
AMPARs, such that at normal resting membrane potentials
these synapses exhibit no detectable postsynaptic responses
to synaptically released glutamate. The ‘unsilencing’ of these
synapses during the induction of LTP is thought to occur
through the incorporation of AMPARs into the postsynaptic
plasma membrane. This hypothesis was quickly expanded
to include synapses that already contained AMPARs and
has led to a large investigative effort into the molecular
mechanisms regulating the trafficking of AMPARs (Bredt
and Nicoll, 2003; Collingridge et al, 2004; Malinow and
Malenka, 2002; Sheng and Kim, 2002; Song and Huganir,
2002).
Most
AMPARs
in
the
central
nervous
system
are
tetramers comprised of four glutamate receptor subunits,
GluR1–GluR4. Although these subunits are highly homo-
logous, both the functional properties of AMPARs and their
trafficking has been suggested to depend on their subunit
composition (Collingridge et al, 2004; Derkach et al, 2007;
Malinow and Malenka, 2002). In the adult hippocampus,
two forms of AMPARs are thought to predominate: GluR1/
GluR2 heteromers and GluR2/GluR3 heteromers (Wenthold
et al, 1996). Based on clever overexpression studies, one
prominent hypothesis suggests that subunit-specific rules
govern the synaptic delivery of AMPARs (Hayashi et al,
2000; Passafaro et al, 2001; Shi et al, 2001). Specifically, it
has been suggested that the insertion of GluR1-containing
AMPARs into synapses is slow under basal conditions and
is strongly stimulated by NMDAR activation, whereas
insertion of GluR2/3 heteromeric receptors may occur
constitutively on a much more rapid timescale.
Where do these new AMPARs come from and how is their
trafficking regulated at a molecular level? Current evidence
suggests that recycling endosomes in the dendrites contain
a reserve pool of AMPARs that are mobilized during LTP
via a process that requires the small GTP-binding protein,
Rab11a (Park et al, 2004) (Figure 2). Surprisingly, AMPARs
do not appear to be inserted directly into the postsynaptic
density (PSD) but rather are exocytosed at perisynaptic
sites. They then can laterally diffuse in the plasma
membrane and be trapped within the PSD due to their
interactions with so-called ‘slot proteins’, which function to
trap AMPARs and greatly reduce their lateral mobility.
Attractive candidates for these slot proteins are a family of
proteins found in the PSD termed MAGUKs (for mem-
brane-associated guanylate kinases). MAGUKS are defined
by
their
multiple
protein
interaction
domains,
most
importantly so-called PDZ domains. Prominent members
of the MAGUK family of PSD proteins include PSD-95,
SAP97, PSD-93, and SAP102 (Kim and Sheng, 2004;
Montgomery et al, 2004). PSD-95 has received the most
attention and its level appears to be particularly important
for controlling the number of AMPARs at individual
synapses as evidenced by the findings that overexpression
of PSD-95 increases synaptic strength and occludes LTP
(Ehrlich and Malinow, 2004; Stein et al, 2003), whereas
knockdown of PSD-95 decreases surface expression of
AMPARs and synaptic strength (Ehrlich et al, 2007; Schluter
et al, 2006).
The influence of PSD-95, as well as other MAGUKS (Elias
et al, 2006; Futai et al, 2007; Schluter et al, 2006), on
AMPARs was surprising given that PSD-95 was originally
isolated because of its strong interaction with NMDARs
(Kornau et al, 1995). Another major surprise was that
AMPARs do not directly bind to MAGUKs but rather do so
via a family of AMPAR auxiliary subunits termed trans-
membrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs). TARPs
are required for the delivery of AMPARs to the plasma
membrane at extrasynaptic sites (Chen et al, 2000; Nicoll
et al, 2006) and also influence their biophysical properties
(Tomita et al, 2005a). Importantly, they are also required
for the synaptic localization of AMPARs due to their direct
interaction with MAGUKs (Schnell et al, 2002).
The detailed molecular mechanisms by which activation
of protein kinases such as CaMKII lead to the synaptic
delivery of AMPARs remains to be determined. Phosphor-
ylation of AMPAR subunits themselves by CaMKII does not
appear critical (Esteban et al, 2003; Lee et al, 2003) although
other phosphorylation sites, such as the PKA or the PKC
sites on GluR1, may be important (Boehm et al, 2006;
Esteban et al, 2003). On the other hand, there is reasonable
evidence that phosphorylation of TARPs occurs following
CAMKII activation (Tsui and Malenka, 2006) and that this
may be critical for LTP (Tomita et al, 2005b). It is, however,
highly likely that AMPARs and TARPs are just a component
of a large complex of proteins, the phosphorylation of which
will be required for LTP expression.
LTP also appears to involve a phosphorylation-driven
increase in the single-channel conductance of AMPARs
themselves (Benke et al, 1998; Soderling and Derkach,
2000). Indeed, CaMKII phosphorylates Ser831 in the
intracellular C terminus of GluR1, resulting in a significant
increase in single-channel conductance of homomeric
GluR1 receptors (Derkach et al, 1999, 2007). However, one
important caveat of this conclusion is that synaptic GluR1-
containing AMPARs also contain GluR2, and in GluR1/2
heteromeric AMPARs, the enhanced conductance upon
phosphorylation by CaMKII is absent (Oh and Derkach,
2005).
Although the evidence to date suggests a more prominent
role for AMPAR exocytosis, the relative contribution of
AMPAR trafficking and changes in the biophysical proper-
ties of AMPARs to the increase in synaptic strength during
LTP are not well defined. One model for the successive
events occurring during the first hour of LTP involves
activation of calcium-dependent signal transduction path-
ways, notably CaMKII, resulting in phosphorylation of
GluR1-containing receptors and an increase in their single-
channel conductance. Roughly simultaneously, AMPARs
are translocated into the PSD via exocytosis and lateral

movement within the plasma membrane. Most investigators
believe that the incorporation of AMPARs into the PSD is
the more important change because it appears to be
accompanied by structural changes in the dendritic spines
and synapses themselves, an attractive mechanism for
maintaining LTP (see below). There are also experimental
findings consistent with rapid presynaptic changes during
LTP, but the retrograde messenger that is responsible
remains elusive, one prominent possibility being BDNF
(Bramham and Messaoudi, 2005).
Maintaining
LTP.
Much
of
the
work
on
NMDAR-
dependent LTP has focused on the mechanisms responsible
for its initial 30–60 min, to a large extent because of
technical limitations in the duration over which stable
electrophysiological recordings can be maintained. None-
theless, the mechanisms that allow LTP to persist for hours,
days, or even longer are of great importance. Like virtually
all cell biological phenomena, the persistence of LTP is
dependent upon new protein synthesis (Reymann and Frey,
2007). This so-called ‘late phase of LTP’ (defined as the
potentiation present more than 1–2 h after LTP induction)
is commonly assumed to depend upon local dendritic
protein synthesis, which supplies needed components to the
synapse (Sutton and Schuman, 2006), as well as transcrip-
tion in the nucleus (Zhou et al, 2006). The signaling to the
nucleus required for long-lasting LTP has been suggested to
depend on a number of protein kinases including PKA,
CaMKIV, and Erk-MAPK, which activate key transcription
factors that may include cAMP response element-binding
protein and immediate-early genes such as c-Fos and
Zif268/Egr-1 (Thomas and Huganir, 2004). These transcrip-
tional
complexes
presumably
promote
expression
of
effector genes that are required for maintaining the synaptic
enhancement.
Several mRNAs can be found in dendrites, including
those of the AMPARs themselves, CaMKII, Arc, and
proteins which may function to regulate receptor trafficking
(Grooms et al, 2006; Job and Eberwine, 2001; Ju et al, 2004;
Mayford et al, 1996; Schuman et al, 2006; Steward and
Schuman, 2001). The trafficking of some of these mRNAs
and their local translation seems to be highly regulated by
activity. Furthermore, other components of the translational
machinery are found in or adjacent to dendritic spines and
polyribosomes are recruited to spine heads following LTP
induction (Bourne et al, 2007). Thus, there is accumulating
evidence that the machinery to provide local, newly
synthesized proteins to synapses is available.
An intriguing hypothesis is that during the synaptic
activation to induce LTP a ‘synaptic tag’ is generated that
functions to capture or sequester plasticity related proteins,
which in turn are required to stabilize the increase in
synaptic strength (Frey and Morris, 1997). However, little is
known about the identity of the synaptic tag or the newly
synthesized proteins that are required to maintain LTP,
although it has been suggested that PKA, CAMKII, or PKMz
might function as the synaptic tag (Reymann and Frey,
2007; Sajikumar et al, 2005; Young et al, 2006).

Model of AMPAR trafficking during LTP and LTD. In the basal state (depicted on top), receptors cycle between the postsynaptic membrane and
intracellular compartments. This is achieved through lateral mobility of the receptors out of the synapse into endocytic zones, where they are endocytosed
into early endosomes in a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent manner. Normally, the receptors are transferred to recycling endosomes and returned to the
plasma membrane by exocytosis, followed by lateral movement into the synapse where they are retained through interaction with MAGUKs. Following
induction of LTP, there is enhanced receptor exocytosis and stabilization at the synapse through a calcium-driven process that involves CAMKII and fusion of
recycling endosomes mediated by Rab11a. Following the induction of LTD, enhanced endocytosis at extrasynaptic sites occurs in a process that is calcium-
dependent and involves protein phosphatases, primarily calcineurin and protein phosphatases 1 (PP1). While in the basal state endocytosis is presumably
balanced by receptor recycling, following LTD receptors are retained within the cell, and perhaps degraded.

potentiated synapses (Luscher et al, 2000). Spines come in a
variety of shapes and sizes, and can undergo rapid shape
changes
that
are
influenced
by
activity
(Yuste
and
Bonhoeffer, 2001). Morphological changes which have been
reported
to
accompany LTP
include
growth
of new
dendritic spines, enlargement of preexisiting spines and
their PSDs, and the splitting of single PSDs and spines into
two functional synapses (Abraham and Williams, 2003;
Matsuzaki et al, 2004; Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2001). An
attractive
model
suggests
that
during
LTP,
recycling
endosomes contribute AMPAR subunits to the synapse, as
well as lipids and constituents which enlarge the synapse
(Lisman and Zhabotinsky, 2001; Luscher et al, 2000; Park
et al, 2004, 2006). At some later time point, there is likely a
concomitant increase in the presynaptic active zone, the size
of which always closely matches that of the PSD (Lisman
and Harris, 1993). This presynaptic re-modeling must
involve post- and presynaptic protein interactions with
likely candidates being cell adhesion molecules such as the
cadherins or neuroligin/neurexin interactions.
Summary. The current view of the mechanisms underlying
this form of LTP can be summarized as follows (Figure 2). A
large
NMDAR-dependent
increase
in
dendritic
spine
calcium concentrations leads to activation of intracellular
signaling cascades involving a number of protein kinases,
most importantly CaMKII. This leads to an increase in the
single-channel conductance of synaptic AMPARs and more
importantly, promotes the incorporation of additional
AMPARs into the PSD. The new synaptic AMPARs are
stabilized through their TARP-mediated interaction with
PDZ domain-containing proteins such as PSD-95. In
parallel, structural changes within the synapse occur, such
that the size of the PSD and dendritic spine are increased.
This in turn drives an increase in the size of the presynaptic
active
zone
such
that
the
potentiated
synapses
are
‘permanently’ enlarged. The maintenance of these changes
for more than a few hours depends on de novo transcription
as well as local dendritic protein synthesis, presumbably to
provide the synapses with a supply of the critical proteins
necessary for maintaining synaptic strength.
NMDAR-Dependent LTD
An important advance in the study of long-term synaptic
plasticity was the establishment of an experimentally
reproducible form of NMDAR-dependent LTD at excitatory
synapses on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (Dudek and
Bear, 1992). This demonstrated that activity could bi-
directionally control synaptic strength (Mulkey and Malenka,
1992), thus providing support for the idea that memories or
experiences were encoded by the distribution of synaptic
weights in neural circuits, not simply by LTP. Shortly
thereafter,
a
similar
form
of
LTD
was
observed
at
neocortical synapses (Kirkwood et al, 1993) suggesting that
mechanistic studies in the hippocampal CA1 region could
provide
insights
that
applied
to
excitatory
synapses
throughout the brain. While that remains true to a large
extent, we now know that in addition to NMDAR-dependent
LTD, there are several other forms of LTD, which we will
discuss in later sections. Moreover, similar to LTP, evidence
is accumulating that LTD mechanisms may contribute to a
large number of brain phenomena including experience-
dependent development, learning and memory, addiction,
and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and
Parkinson’s disease (Malenka and Bear, 2004; Brebner et al,
2005; Kreitzer and Malenka 2007; Hsieh et al, 2006).
Triggering NMDAR-dependent LTD. The typical protocol
for
eliciting
LTD
involves
prolonged
repetitive
low-
frequency stimulation (B900 stimuli at 1 Hz; Dudek and
Bear, 1992; Mulkey and Malenka, 1992), although the
number of stimuli can be dramatically reduced and the
frequency changed if the postsynaptic neuron is modestly
depolarized (to B50 mV), partially relieving the Mg2 +
block of the NMDAR (Selig et al, 1995). NMDAR-dependent
LTD can also be induced by correctly timing the activation
of presynaptic axons and the postsynaptic neuron (STDP;
(Dan and Poo, 2006).
Like LTP, LTD is input-specific and depends upon an
NMDAR-dependent
increase
in
postsynaptic
calcium
(Mulkey and Malenka, 1992). The predominant current
hypothesis is that quantitative properties of the postsynap-
tic calcium signal within dendritic spines dictates whether
LTP or LTD is triggered, with LTD requiring a modest
increase in calcium (Cummings et al, 1996), whereas LTP
requires a increase beyond some critical threshold value
(Malenka and Nicoll, 1993). The temporal characteristics of
the increase in calcium may also be important since
changing the relative timing between pre- and postsynaptic
activation by just a few tens of milliseconds can reverse the
direction of synaptic modification (Dan and Poo, 2006).
Differential buffering of postsynaptic calcium levels has
been reported to enable a transition between LTP and LTD
(Harney et al, 2006; Nishiyama et al, 2000). These findings
demonstrate the thin line that lies between synaptic activity
eliciting a potentiation vs a depression and provide support
to the idea that both LTP and LTD are utilized in parallel for
encoding experiences in vivo.
LTD signal transduction mechanisms. An influential
hypothesis for the signal transduction pathway triggering
LTD suggested that while LTP was due to the preferential
activation of CaMKII, LTD involves activation of a calcium-
dependent protein phosphatase cascade consisting of the
calcium/calmodulin-dependent
phosphatase
calcineurin
(also known as protein phosphatase 2B), PP1, and a
phosphoprotein termed inhibitor-1 which functions to
inhibit PP1 until it is dephosphorylated by calcineurin
(Lisman, 1989). Consistent with this hypothesis, postsynap-
tic inhibition of these phosphatases prevents LTD (Kirk-
wood and Bear, 1994; Morishita et al, 2001; Mulkey et al,
1994, 1993), whereas directly loading CA1 pyramidal cells
with PP1 enhances LTD (Morishita et al, 2001). Although
signaling proteins other than phosphatases have been
suggested to play key roles in LTD (Bolshakov et al, 2000;
Dan and Poo, 2006; Palmer et al, 2005; Peineau et al, 2007),
the hypothesis that LTP involves preferential activation of
protein kinases while LTD involves activation of phospha-
tases remains predominant.

(Hrabetova and Sacktor, 1996; Kameyama et al, 1998; Lee

dephosphorylation

substrates
during

particularly convincing, as postsynaptic inhibition of PKA,

(Gomez et al, 2002; Snyder et al, 2005). Consistent with a
role for PKA, LTD is associated with selective depho-
sphorylation of Ser845 on GluR1, a PKA substrate site (Lee
et al, 2000). This dephosphorylation event may contribute
to the expression of LTD, as it decreases the AMPAR open-
channel probability (Banke et al, 2000), and mice with
knock-in alanine substitution of both Ser845 and Ser831 (a
CaMKII-substrate site) exhibit impaired NMDAR-depen-
dent LTD (Lee et al, 2003).
Expression mechanisms of LTD. The demonstration of
silent synapses and their conversion to functional synapses
during LTP by the incorporation of AMPARs (Malenka and
Nicoll, 1997) immediately gave credence to the idea that the
opposite might happen during LTD, that is, the removal or
endocytosis of AMPARs. Consistent with this idea, it was
demonstrated that pharmacological manipulations of activ-
ity in cultured neurons (Carroll et al, 1999; Lissin et al,
1998) or application of glutamate receptor agonists (Beattie
et al, 2000; Carroll et al, 1999; Ehlers, 2000; Heynen et al,
2000; Lin et al, 2000; Lissin et al, 1998) could cause a loss of
AMPARs from synapses due to dynamin- and clathrin-
dependent endocytosis (Carroll et al, 2001; Collingridge
et al, 2004; Derkach et al, 2007; Malinow and Malenka,
2002). Furthermore, postsynaptic inhibition of dynamin
activity impaired LTD in CA1 pyramidal cells in slices (Lee
et al, 2002; Luscher et al, 1999; Morishita et al, 2005). Based
in large part on these sorts of observations, the current
leading hypothesis is that the expression mechanism of
NMDAR-dependent LTD is due to activity-dependent
endocytosis of synaptic AMPARs (Bredt and Nicoll, 2003;
Collingridge et al, 2004; Derkach et al, 2007; Malenka and
Bear, 2004; Malinow and Malenka, 2002) (Figure 2).
The precise molecular mechanisms by which endocytosis
of AMPARs occurs during LTD is still not clear but one
likely scenario is that it involves dissociation of AMPARs
from their anchors within the PSD, followed by lateral
movement to the edge of the PSD where they undergo
clathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis (Ashby et al,
2004; Blanpied et al, 2002; Groc et al, 2004). Consistent with
a key role for protein phosphatases, the endocytosis of
AMPARs is regulated by calcium-dependent dephosphor-
ylation (Beattie et al, 2000; Carroll et al, 2001; Ehlers, 2000).
Key substrates for facilitating endocytosis may include
components of the endocytic machinery (Carroll et al, 2001;
Lai et al, 1999; Slepnev et al, 1998) as well as AMPAR
subunits themselves (Ehlers, 2000). Following endocytosis,
AMPARs exhibit increased colocalization with the clathrin
adaptor protein AP2 (Carroll et al, 1999), an interaction that
may be promoted by the Ca2 +-dependent adaptor protein
hippocalcin (Palmer et al, 2005).
Consistent with a role for ‘slot proteins’ in the regulation
of AMPAR surface levels, LTD has been reported to depend
on PP1-dependent dephosphorylation of stargazin (Tomita
et al, 2005b). This dephosphorylation might permit the
dissociation of stargazin from PSD-95 and its diffusion out
of the PSD, enabling LTD through loss of synaptic AMPARs
(Ziff, 2007). Ubiquitination (Colledge et al, 2003) or
depalmitoylation (El-Husseini et al, 2002) of PSD-95 has
also been suggested to be critical for agonist-induced
endocytosis of AMPARs but whether these events are
required for synaptically induced LTD has not been
determined. Additional proteins implicated in AMPAR
endocytosis include the AMPAR interacting protein PICK1
(Hanley and Henley, 2005; Kim et al, 2001), the small
GTPases Rap1 (Zhu et al, 2002, 2005) and Rab5 (Brown
et al, 2005), and a protein termed cpg2 (Cottrell et al, 2004).
It has been suggested that particular AMPAR subunits,
specifically GluR2, may be especially important for the
endocytosis of AMPARs during LTD, in part because of its
direct interaction with AP2 (Lee et al, 2002). One key
finding consistent with this hypothesis is that peptides that
selectively interfere with this interaction have been reported
to inhibit LTD (Lee et al, 2002). However, AP2 can bind
other AMPAR subunits (Kastning et al, 2007; Lee et al,
2002) and LTD is still observed in hippocampal slices
obtained from mice lacking GluR2 as well as GluR2 and
GluR3 (Jia et al, 1996; Meng et al, 2003). Thus, the
importance of specific AMPAR subunits for LTD is not
firmly established.
Summary. A current simplified view of the mechanisms
underlying NMDAR-dependent LTD can be summarized as
follows (Figure 2): a modest increase in postsynaptic
calcium concentration within dendritic spines due to
modest activation of NMDARs leads to preferential activa-
tion of protein phosphatases (as well as a few other key
signaling proteins). This leads to the dissociation of
AMPARs from their molecular scaffolds in the PSD and
their lateral movement to endocytic zones on the periphery
of the PSD, where they are endocytosed and potentially
degraded. We have not discussed the maintenance of LTD
because there is little work on this topic. There is evidence
that LTD is accompanied by a shrinkage in the size of
dendritic spines (Nagerl et al, 2004; Zhou et al, 2004) and
that this may be due to the loss of AMPARs (Hsieh et al,
2006). Furthermore, similar to LTP, protein translation may
be needed for the long-term stable expression of LTD
(Pfeiffer and Huber, 2006). Thus, it is generally believed that
the activity-dependent trafficking of AMPARs into and out
of synapses during LTP and LTD, respectively, is the first
critical step in the morphological growth or shrinkage of
synapses and that these structural modifications are the
mechanisms by which bidirectional changes in synaptic
strength are maintained. Indeed, the size of individual
synapses correlates closely with the number of AMPARs
they contain (Matsuzaki et al, 2001; Nusser et al, 1998;
Takumi et al, 1999).
Presynaptic LTP

for over 30 years, it is clear that a mechanistically distinct

form of plasticity coexists in the hippocampus at the so-
called mossy fiber synapses, the synapses between the axons
of dentate gyrus granule cells (ie, mossy fibers) and the
proximal apical dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells (Nicoll
and Malenka, 1995; Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005). Mossy fiber
LTP (MF-LTP) is of increasing interest due to the fact that it
appears to be a prototype for mechanistically similar forms
of LTP found in several other brain regions including the
thalamus at corticothalamic synapses (Castro-Alamancos
and Calcagnotto, 1999), the cerebellum at parallel fiber-
Purkinje cell synapses (Linden, 1997; Salin et al, 1996), and
perhaps in the striatum at cortico-striatal synapses (Spencer
and Murphy, 2002). Thus, like NMDAR-dependent LTP,
this form of LTP may play multiple functional roles in the
brain.
In contrast to NMDAR-dependent LTP, the triggering and
expression of this form of LTP is thought to be solely or
predominantly presynaptic, thus we refer to it as presynap-
tic LTP. While somewhat controversial, most experimental
evidence suggests that presynaptic LTP is triggered by high-
frequency tetanic stimulation, which causes a large, activity-
dependent increase in calcium concentration within pre-
synaptic axon terminals (Nicoll and Malenka, 1995; Nicoll
and Schmitz, 2005; Zalutsky and Nicoll, 1990). Presynaptic
voltage-dependent calcium channels are the critical source
of the calcium increase, although the triggering of this LTP
at MF synapses can be facilitated by the activation of
presynaptic kainate receptors, particularly GluR6 (Lauri
et al, 2001; Schmitz et al, 2003). Results from pharmaco-
logical manipulations and knockout mice are all consistent
with the hypothesis that the increase in presynaptic calcium
activates a calcium/calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase.
This leads to a increase in presynaptic cAMP and activation
of PKA, which phosphorylates critical presynaptic sub-
strates to cause a long-lasting enhancement in transmitter
release (Nicoll and Malenka, 1995; Nicoll and Schmitz,
2005). Although this sequence of events is consistent with
most of the results from all of the synapses that have been
reported to express presynaptic LTP, surprisingly, a very
different postsynaptic induction mechanism has been
proposed to occur at MF synapses. This involves trans-
synaptic interactions between postsynaptic EphB receptor
tyrosine kinases and presynaptic B-Ephrin ligands leading,
via an unknown mechanism, to a long-lasting enhancement
of transmitter release (Armstrong et al, 2006; Contractor
et al, 2002).
Despite some controversy concerning the mechanism
underlying the induction of presynaptic LTP at MF
synapses, there is general agreement that its expression is
due to an increase in neurotransmitter release. One
mechanism
for
mediating
a
long-lasting
increase
in
transmitter release is to enhance the calcium influx into
the presynaptic terminal when it is invaded by an action
potential; for example via a long-lasting modulation of
presynaptic calcium channels. However, direct imaging of
the action potential-dependent increase in presynaptic
calcium in MF boutons indicates that no change occurs
following the triggering of MF-LTP (Kamiya et al, 2002;
Regehr and Tank, 1991; Reid et al, 2004).
The other major mechanism for enhancing transmitter
release is via some modulation of the machinery responsible
for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. In this context, the focus has
been on presynaptic proteins known to be substrates for
PKA. Because presynaptic terminals are relatively inacces-
sible, an important approach has been examining knockout
mice lacking specific presynaptic proteins. Mice lacking
synapsins exhibited normal MF-LTP (Spillane et al, 1995)
indicating that these prominent PKA substrates were not
necessary. In contrast, knockout animals lacking the
synaptic vesicle protein Rab3A, a small GTPase (Castillo
et al, 1997; Lonart et al, 1998), or its binding partner, the
active zone protein Rim1a (Castillo et al, 2002; Powell et al,
2004) lack both MF-LTP as well as presynaptic LTP in the
cerebellum. Rim1a is a substrate of PKA and thus these
findings suggest that presynaptic LTP may require a GTP-
dependent interaction between Rab3a and Rim1a at the
interface of synaptic vesicles and the active zone. Indeed,
using cultures of cerebellar neurons in which presynaptic
LTP can be elicited, the critical residue phosphorylated by
PKA in Rim1a has been identified (Lonart et al, 2003). One
important caveat to this hypothesis, however, is that the
presynaptic enhancement of synaptic transmission seen
upon application of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin
is unaltered in knockout mice lacking Rab3a or Rim1a. This
provides a complication for the simple model implicating
Rim1a and Rab3a as the crucial mediators of the enhanced
transmission caused by presynaptic activation of PKA.
Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor-Dependent
LTD
Under the appropriate experimental conditions, low-fre-
quency stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural
inputs to CA1 pyramidal cells can trigger, in addition to
NMDAR-dependent LTD, a mechanistically distinct form of
LTD, that is dependent upon activation of metabotropic
glutamate receptors (mGluRs; mGLUR LTD) (Anwyl, 2006;
Bolshakov et al, 2000; Malenka and Bear, 2004; Oliet et al,
1997). Various forms of mGluR LTD have been observed in
many brain regions, most notably at the parallel fiber to
Purkinje cell synapse (Ito, 1989; Linden and Connor, 1995).
This so-called cerebellar LTD is elicited when parallel fibers
are activated coincident with climbing fiber activation and
has been suggested to be particularly important for certain
forms of motor learning.
Typically, the induction of mGluR LTD in the CA1 region
of the hippocampus requires bursts of afferent stimulation
or paired-pulse stimulation at modest frequencies. Pre-
sumably, this increases the likelihood of activating the
extrasynaptic group I mGluRs that are required to trigger
this form of plasticity. mGluR LTD can also be elicited by
bath application of group I mGluR agonists such as DHPG
(Bellone and Luscher, 2005; Huber et al, 2000, 2001). Group
I mGluRs (mGluR1 and mGluR5) are defined by their
capacity to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis and
thereby produce diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate.
Although mGluR1 is the principal receptor implicated in the
induction of mGluR LTD in the ventral tegmental area
(VTA), cerebellum, and neostriatum, mGluR5 has been
implicated
in
the
hippocampus,
cortex,
and
nucleus
accumbens (Anwyl, 2006).
The intracellular signaling pathways responsible for
mGluR LTD have not been extensively examined. PKC
appears to be required for mGluR LTD in the cerebellum

(De Zeeuw et al, 1998; Linden and Connor, 1991) and the
VTA (Bellone and Luscher, 2005), but perhaps not in the
hippocampus (Huang and Hsu, 2006). Other signaling
proteins suggested to be important for mGluR LTD include
the MAPKs p38, Erk, and Jnk (Gallagher et al, 2004; Li et al,
2007; Rush et al, 2002), tyrosine phosphatases (Huang and
Hsu, 2006; Moult et al, 2006), and phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (Hou and Klann, 2004) but how these various
enzymes might lead to a long-lasting decrease in synaptic
strength is unknown.
Similar to NMDAR-dependent LTD, mGluR LTD in the
hippocampus and cerebellum appears to involve clathrin-
dependent endocytosis of AMPARs (Snyder et al, 2001;
Wang and Linden, 2000; Xiao et al, 2001). For cerebellar
mGluR LTD, a large body of work is consistent with a
specific molecular model in which mGluR activation due to
parallel fiber stimulation combined with calcium influx due
to climbing fiber activation results in activation of PKCa
and its targeting to synapses via the protein PICK1 (Jorntell
and Hansel, 2006; Perez et al, 2001; Steinberg et al, 2006).
PKCa then phosphorylates Ser880 on GluR2 causing GluR2
to dissociate from the AMPAR-binding proteins GRIP/ABP
and bind to PICK1. This then allows lateral diffusion of the
AMPARs and ultimately internalization (Chung et al, 2003;
Steinberg et al, 2006; Xia et al, 2000). This cascade of events
is significantly different than those believed to occur during
NMDAR-dependent LTD, pointing out that the molecular
mechanisms underlying apparently similar forms of plasti-
city may be cell type-specific. Indeed, mGluR LTD at
excitatory synapses onto dopamine cells in the VTA has
been suggested to involve a selective loss of AMPARs that
lack the GluR2 subunit (Bellone and Luscher, 2005, 2006),
rather than those that contain GluR2.
Another important feature of mGluR LTD, at least in the
hippocampus, is that it appears to be dependent on mGluR-
triggered protein synthesis (Hou and Klann, 2004; Huber
et al, 2000, 2001; Snyder et al, 2001). This link between
protein synthesis and mGluR LTD gained considerable
attention following the report that mice lacking the gene
encoding the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)
exhibited enhanced mGluR LTD in both the hippocampus
(Huber et al, 2002) and the cerebellum (Koekkoek et al,
2005). These mice serve as a model for the Fragile X
syndrome in humans, an X-linked form of mental retarda-
tion, and exhibit several features of the human disorder
(Bear et al, 2004). Surprisingly, the enhanced mGluR LTD
observed in the FMRP knockout mice is independent of
protein synthesis and proteasomal degradation (Hou et al,
2006; Nosyreva and Huber, 2006), cellular processes that
appear crucial for mGluR LTD in wild-type mice. Never-
theless, this potential link between an mGluR-triggered
form of synaptic plasticity and Fragile X syndrome has
focused
attention
on
mGluR
antagonists
as
possible
therapeutic agents for this and other developemental
disorders (Bear et al, 2004).
There are also results consistent with a presynaptic locus
of expression for mGluR LTD (Anwyl, 2006; Nosyreva and
Huber, 2005; Zakharenko et al, 2002). As these forms of
mGluR LTD are still triggered postsynaptically, they must
involve a retrograde messenger, one leading candidate being
12-lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid (Feinmark
et al, 2003). In an attempt to reconcile the observations of a
presynaptic locus of expression of mGluR LTD with the
bulk of the literature describing a postsynaptic locus of
expression, a developmental shift in the mechanisms of
mGluR LTD has been proposed (Nosyreva and Huber,
2005). Specifically, it has been suggested that in slices
prepared from neonatal (P8–P15) animals, mGluR-LTD is
independent of protein synthesis and is due to a presynaptic
modification, whereas in older animals (P21–P35) mGluR
LTD is mediated by a protein synthesis-dependent reduc-
tion in the postsynaptic levels of AMPARs.
Endocannabinoid-Mediated LTD
A major advance over the last decade has been the
demonstration of the existence of endogenous cannabinoids
(termed endocannabinoids) and their roles in modulating
synaptic function (Chevaleyre et al, 2006; Freund et al, 2003;
Kreitzer and Regehr, 2002; Piomelli, 2003; Wilson and
Nicoll, 2002). It is now well established that in a number of
brain regions endocannabinoids are retrograde messengers
that are released by postsynaptic cells in response to strong
depolarization
and/or
activation
of
G-protein-coupled
receptors (eg, mGluRs and muscarinic receptors) and
function to transiently inhibit transmitter release (for
B0.5–1 min) at either excitatory or inhibitory synpases
via activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors.
Much of the mechanistic work on the transient synaptic
effects of endocannabinioids was performed in the hippo-
campus and cerebellum, synapses that are often thought to
be prototypic of synapses throughout the brain. It was
therefore surprising when a form of LTD that required
endocannabinoids, (so-called endocannabinoid-mediated
LTD; eCB-LTD) was observed in the glutamatergic synapses
onto medium spiny neurons in the striatum as well as at
synapses between layer V pyramidal neurons (Gerdeman
et al, 2002; Robbe et al, 2002a; Sjostrom et al, 2003). In the
hippocampus, in contrast, endocannabinoids mediate a
form of LTD at inhibitory, but not excitatory, synapses
(Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2004). In the dorsal striatum, eCB-
LTD requires postsynaptic activation of group I mGluRs,
L-type calcium channels and D2 dopamine receptors (Choi
and Lovinger, 1997; Kreitzer and Malenka, 2005, 2007;
Pisani et al, 2005; Sung et al, 2001; Tang et al, 2001)
(Figure 3). This leads to the production most likely of
anandamide (Ade and Lovinger, 2007), which activates
presynaptic CB1 receptors. However, prolonged activation
of these CB1 receptors alone is not sufficient to elicit eCB-
LTD; concomitant presynaptic activity is also required, a
requirement that likely accounts for the input specificity of
this form of plasticity (Singla et al, 2007). Another
important feature of eCB-LTD in the dorsal striatum is
that it appears to be restricted to the medium spiny neurons
that primarily express D2 dopamine receptors and is not
present at excitatory synapses on cells expressing D1
receptors (Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007; but see Wang
et al, 2006). This cell-restricted expression of eCB-LTD
may have important functional implications, a topic to be
discussed below.
In the nucleus accumbens (NAc), eCB-LTD also requires
postsynaptic activation of group I mGluRs and is modulated
by drugs of abuse (Fourgeaud et al, 2004; Mato et al, 2004;
Robbe et al, 2002b). In the cortex, eCB-LTD can be elicited

by a spike-timing-dependent protocol (Sjostrom et al, 2003)
but does not depend on postsynaptic activation of mGluRs
and surprisingly, requires coincident activation of presy-
naptic NMDARs. LTD in the cerebellum was also reported
to depend on retrograde endocannabinoid signaling (Safo
and Regehr, 2005), but the mechanistic basis for this
observation is still unclear, since, as discussed above,
cerebellar LTD is expressed postsynaptically.
Metaplasticity
Metaplasticity refers to a higher-order form of synaptic
plasticity in which synaptic activity, which by itself does not
directly affect synaptic efficacy, leads to a persistent change
in the direction or magnitude of subsequent activity-
dependent synaptic plasticity. In other words, metaplasti-
city is the ‘plasticity of plasticity’ (Abraham and Bear, 1996;
Bear et al, 1987). The best-studied examples of metaplas-
ticity are those in which prior activity shifts the threshold
for LTP and LTD induction. For example, in the hippo-
campus, repetitive activation of NMDARs in a manner that
does not elicit LTP or LTD can nonetheless elicit a rapid
shift in plasticity thresholds such that LTP becomes difficult
to elicit and LTD induction is favored (Huang et al, 1992;
Wang and Wagner, 1999). A potential functional role for
metaplasticity has been demonstrated by modifying the
level of activity during the development of the visual cortex
in vivo (Philpot et al, 2001, 2003, 2007). This causes shifts in
the thresholds for LTP and LTD in cells in visual cortex
presumably due to changes in the stoichiometry of synaptic
NMDARs. As discussed below, such changes in synaptic
plasticity may importantly contribute to the experience-
dependent plasticity of ocular dominance following mani-
pulation of the visual environment.
Synaptic Scaling: A Form of Homeostatic
Plasticity
Theoretically, without additional stabilizing mechanisms,
activity-dependent forms of plasticity such as LTP and LTD
could drive neural circuit activity towards epileptogenic
excitation or complete quiescence. Synaptic scaling is
considered a form of homeostatic plasticity that counters
potentially maladaptive effects of long-term synapse-spe-
cific
plasticity
by
globally
affecting
the
transmission
through all synapses on a given neuron (Turrigiano and
Nelson, 2004). In terms of its basic properties and under-
lying mechanisms, this form of synaptic plasticity contrasts
dramatically with the forms of LTP and LTD we have
discussed thus far.
Synaptic scaling occurs when network activity is drama-
tically decreased or increased for prolonged (4B12–24 h)
periods of time. Decreased activity (due to blockade of
synaptic transmission or spiking) causes an increase in the
strength of all excitatory synapses onto excitatory neurons,
whereas increased activity (generally induced by partially
blocking inhibitory synapses) reduces the strength of all
excitatory synapses (Turrigiano et al, 1998). Importantly,
the relative strengths of individual synpases appear to be
maintained even though global synaptic input is signifi-
cantly altered.
Relatively little is known about the molecular mechan-
isms underlying synaptic scaling other than it involves
changes in the number of AMPARs (and NMDARs) at
individual synapses (Perez-Otano and Ehlers, 2005; Turri-
giano and Nelson, 2004; Watt et al, 2000) and likely
presynaptic changes as well (Burrone and Murthy, 2003;
Burrone et al, 2002). Recently, evidence has been presented
supporting a role for secreted factors in the induction of
homeostatic plasticity, suggesting that key triggers for this
form of plasticity may not be cell autonomous. Specifically,
secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis
factor-a from glial cells appears to be necessary for the
increase in the level of synaptic AMPARs caused by
extended periods of activity blockade (Beattie et al, 2002;
Stellwagen et al, 2005; Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006). In
addition, there is evidence suggesting a role for secreted
BDNF in driving the opposite form of synaptic scaling; the
decrease in synaptic strengths caused by extended periods
of increased network acitivity (Rutherford et al, 1998;
Turrigiano, 2006).
FUNCTIONAL ROLES OF LTP AND LTD

underlying many different forms of experience-dependent

receptors (D2R) enhances endocannabinoid production and the subse-
quent induction of presynaptic LTD, mediated through activation of
presynaptic CB1 receptors (CB1R). (From Kreitzer and Malenka, 2005.)

patterns of activity can elicit bidirectional control over
synaptic strength. Establishing a causal connection between
a specific form of synaptic plasticity and the behavioral
consequences of specific experiences remains a daunting
task. Nevertheless, over the last decade, significant advances
have been made in connecting synaptic plasticity to a
number of different types of adaptive experience-dependent
plasticity. Furthermore, it has become increasingly clear
that understanding the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity
may provide important insights into the pathophysiology of
a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders and also point the
way toward novel therapeutic approaches. In the following
sections, we will briefly provide examples that demonstrate
that LTP and LTD do occur in vivo in response to
experience and may play a causal role in mediating the
consequences of experience.
Hippocampal-Dependent Plasticity and Learning
Given that LTP was first described in the hippocampus, a
structure well established to be critically important for
declarative memory (Squire et al, 2004), it is not surprising
that over the last three decades there has been a major effort
aimed at demonstrating a role for hippocampal LTP in
encoding new memories (Martin et al, 2000; Morris, 2006).
Correlations have been observed between defective hippo-
campal synaptic plasticity and defective hippocampal-
dependent memory tasks upon perturbation of a number
of proteins which function in synaptic plasticity, either
pharmacologically, or through gene knockout (Lynch, 2004;
Martin et al, 2000; Morris, 2006). For example, rodents in
which NMDAR antagonists were infused into the hippo-
campus (Morris and Frey, 1997), as well as mice lacking
expression of the NMDAR subunit NR1 in the forebrain
(Tsien et al, 1996), are defective both in LTP and certain
types of spatial learning. Furthermore, mice in which the
specific NMDAR subunit NR2B was overexpressed to
enhance
NMDAR
function
were
reported
to
display
enhanced LTP and enhanced spatial learning (Tang et al,
1999). Recently, more compelling evidence for a role of
synaptic plasticity in hippocampal-dependent learning has
been presented. During an inhibitory avoidance task, LTP
could be recorded in vivo in a subset of hippocampal CA1
pyramidal cells (Whitlock et al, 2006). This demonstrated
that the patterns of activity generated during a real learning
task were sufficient to elicit LTP. Perhaps even more
convincing was the demonstration that in vivo infusion of a
PKMz
inhibitor
into
the
hippocampus
abolished
the
maintenance of LTP and simultaneously the storage of a
long-lasting spatial memory (Pastalkova et al, 2006). These
findings strongly suggest that maintained LTP was required
for the engram that stored the key spatial information.
In addition to its role as a key component of the
mechanisms underlying the encoding of declarative mem-
ories, hippocampal NMDAR-dependent LTP (as well as
LTD) may provide important insights into the pathophy-
siology and potential treatment of major mental illnesses.
For example, a leading hypothesis for the pathophysiology
of schizophrenia posits a dysfunction in glutamatergic
synapses, in particular a hypofunction of NMDARs (Coyle
and Tsai, 2004; Javitt, 2006; McCullumsmith et al, 2004;
Tamminga, 1998). Thus, understanding the signaling events
downstream of NMDAR activation may provide important
insights into this devastating disease. A role for dysfunc-
tions in LTP and/or LTD mechanisms as possible con-
tributors
to
schizophrenia
is
also
attractive
in
that
schizophrenia likely involves neurodevelopmental abnorm-
alities (Lewis and Levitt, 2002) and these phenomena play
an important role in the early postnatal development of
neural circuitry (see below). Indeed, genetic variation in
calcineurin, which is thought to play an important role in
NMDAR-dependent LTD, has been associated with schizo-
phrenia (Gerber et al, 2003).
Another example of the potential importance of studying
LTP and LTD comes from investigation into the therapeutic
mechanisms of drugs used to treat bipolar disorder. Drugs
such as lithium, valproate, and lamotrigine have been
reported to have significant effects on the phosphorylation
of AMPAR subunits and affect their surface expression (Du
et al, 2003, 2004, 2007; Gray et al, 2003). These findings
suggest that these drugs may somehow tap into the same
mechanisms that have evolved to generate LTP and LTD
and also point to novel approaches for the development of
new therapeutic agents that may prove efficacious for
treatment of this illness.
Experience-Dependent Plasticity in the
Developing Sensory Cortex
Sensory receptive fields in the cortex are modified by early
postnatal
experience
and
the
link
between
synaptic
plasticity and these forms of experience-dependent plasti-
city in sensory systems is becoming increasingly established
(Foeller and Feldman, 2004; Karmarkar and Dan, 2006;
Malenka and Bear, 2004). For example, a strong connection
between
synaptic
plasticity
and
experience-dependent
plasticity has been established in the visual system during
the shift in ocular dominance caused by monocular
deprivation (MD) (Foeller and Feldman, 2004; Karmarkar
and Dan, 2006; Malenka and Bear, 2004). MD induces
biochemical changes in AMPAR subunits in visual cortex
that appear identical to those elicited during NMDAR-
dependent LTD (Heynen et al, 2003) and visual cortical
slices obtained from monocularly deprived animals show
greatly reduced LTD (Crozier et al, 2007; Heynen et al,
2003), suggesting that LTD was elicited in vivo. Further-
more, in vivo recordings demonstrated that MD caused a
rapid decrease in the visually evoked potential (VEP) from
the deprived eye and a slower enhancement of the VEP from
the open eye (Frenkel and Bear, 2004). Importantly,
completely blocking activity in the deprived eye prevented
the depression of the VEP demonstrating that this depres-
sion required retinal activity and, like LTD, was therefore
activity-dependent (Frenkel and Bear, 2004).
Similar results have been obtained in somatosensory
barrel cortex in that sensory deprivation by whisker
trimming or plucking causes a weakening of synaptic
responses in layer 2/3 cells and an occlusion of LTD (Allen
et al, 2003). This appears to be due to alterations in the
patterns of pre- and postsynaptic spiking in vivo in a
manner that is ideal for generating spike-timing-dependent
LTD (Celikel et al, 2004). LTP mechanisms, on the other
hand, appear to be important for the strengthening of
synapses in developing barrel cortex due to early postnatal

experience. In vivo experience drives recombinant GluR1
into barrel cortex synapses in a manner similar to that
which occurs during NMDAR-dependent LTP, whereas
expression of a short peptide that inhibits delivery of
endogenous AMPARs blocks the experience-dependent
increase in synaptic strength (Takahashi et al, 2003) as
does a dominant-negative form of the synaptic scaffold
protein PSD-95 (Ehrlich and Malinow, 2004). Thus, as
predicted by theoretical considerations (Bienenstock et al,
1982; Stent, 1973), LTP and LTD mechanisms appear to be
critically involved in early neural circuit development and it
is not difficult
to
imagine how disruption
in these
mechanisms might contribute to a host of neurodevelope-
mental disorders such as autism (Geschwind and Levitt,
2007; Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003).
Synaptic Plasticity and Fear Conditioning
Pavlovian fear conditioning is a form of associative memory
that depends on the amygdala for its induction and
maintenance (Sigurdsson et al, 2007). It occurs when a
neutral stimulus (such as a tone) is temporally paired with a
strong noxious stimulus (such as an electric shock) creating
a memory trace, the consequences of which are that the
neutral stimulus elicits the learned fear response. Consider-
able evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that LTP at
sensory inputs to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala is
necessary and perhaps sufficient for establishing this
engram (Sigurdsson et al, 2007). NMDAR-dependent LTP
can be induced at cortical and thalamic inputs into the
lateral amygdala, both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, fear
conditioning induces synaptic potentiation at these sy-
napses, and this increase in synaptic strength occludes
further induction of LTP (McKernan and Shinnick-Galla-
gher, 1997; Rogan et al, 1997; Tsvetkov et al, 2002). Like
NMDAR-dependent LTP in the hippocampus, fear con-
ditioning has also been shown to lead to the insertion of
new AMPARs at thalamic input synapses onto lateral
amygdala neurons (Rumpel et al, 2005) and perhaps most
convincingly, expression of a peptide that prevents the LTP-
induced incorporation of AMPARs at synapses abolished
acquisition of this form of associative memory (Rumpel
et al, 2005).
NMDARs in the amgydala are also involved in the
extinction of learned fear, which can be conceptualized as a
different form of learning (Myers and Davis, 2002).
Furthermore, acute treatment with D-cycloserine, a partial
agonist of NMDARs, enhances the learning processes that
are responsible for fear extinction via actions in the
amygdala (Walker et al, 2002). On the basis of these
observations, clinical trials have been initiated using D-
cycloserine in combination with behavioral therapy to
enhance the extinction of fear in phobic patients (Hofmann
et al, 2006; Otto et al, 2007; Ressler et al, 2004). Results to
date suggest that the administration of D-cycloserine either
before or shortly after exposure to fearful cues does in fact
enhance the extinction of the anxiety previously associated
with specific cues. Thus, the study of the neural substrates
of learned fear and its extinction is a compelling example of
how research on the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity has
directly led to a potential novel treatment for common
psychiatric disorders.
Synaptic Plasticity in Dopamine Circuits
The defining characteristic of drug addiction is persistent
and compulsive seeking and ingestion of drugs despite
adverse consequences. Over the last decade, a leading
hypothesis has been that an important neural substrate
of
addiction,
in
particular
relapse,
is
long-term
associative memory processes occurring in several neural
circuits
that
receive
input
from
midbrain
dopamine
neurons (Everitt and Robbins, 2005; Hyman et al, 2006).
In other words, it is thought that addictive drugs can usurp
the normal adaptive mechanisms underlying reward-based
learning.
The most well-established key site of action of addictive
drugs is the mesolimbic dopamine system consisting of the
VTA and the NAc. Excitatory synaptic transmission in these
structures is critical for mediating several forms of long-
lasting, drug-induced behavioral plasticity (Everitt and
Wolf, 2002; Hyman and Malenka, 2001). It, therefore, has
been reasonable to hypothesize that plasticity at these
synapses plays an important role in mediating some of the
behavioral consequences of exposure to drugs of abuse
(Wolf, 1998).
Indeed, it is now established that various forms of LTP
and LTD can be elicited at excitatory synapses in the VTA
and NAc (Gerdeman et al, 2003; Kauer, 2004; Kelley, 2004;
Thomas and Malenka, 2003). Furthermore, administration
of a single dose of several different classes of drugs of abuse
causes
a significant increase
in synaptic strength at
excitatory synapses onto dopamine cells in the VTA (Faleiro
et al, 2004; Saal et al, 2003; Ungless et al, 2001). This
increase shares mechanisms with LTP in the VTA and
appears to involve upregulation of AMPARs (Ungless et al,
2001). This drug-induced ‘LTP’ appears to play a functional
role in triggering or mediating some drug-induced beha-
vioral adaptations, as both conditioned place preference
and behavioral sensitization are blocked by injection of
glutamate receptor antagonists into the VTA (Harris and
Aston-Jones, 2003; Vanderschuren and Kalivas, 2000). In
addition, conditioned place preference, as well as the
synaptic potentiation that is observed following cocaine
administration, are impaired in GluR1 knockout mice
(Dong et al, 2004), with the caveat that these mice still
exhibit robust behavioral sensitization in response to
repeated exposure to psychostimulants (Dong et al, 2004;
Vekovischeva et al, 2001).
While drugs of abuse have been observed to induce LTP
in the VTA, LTD has been observed in the NAc following
chronic in vivo cocaine administration (Thomas et al,
2001). Consistent with a functional role for this LTD in
addiction, injection of glutamate receptor antagonists into
the NAc abolishes the expression of behavioral sensitization
(Kelley, 2004). Furthermore, amphetamine-induced beha-
vioral sensitization and LTD in the NAc were both abolished
by injection into the NAc of inhibitors of AMPAR
endocytosis (Brebner et al, 2005). Interestingly, overexpres-
sion of GluR1 in the NAc (mimicking an ‘LTP’-like
condition) facilitates the extinction of cocaine-seeking
(Sutton et al, 2003) and even makes cocaine aversive in a
conditioned place preference assay (Kelz et al, 1999).
Recently, it has also been reported that cocaine self-
administration abolishes the ability to induce LTD in the

and
in
vivo
administration
of
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cocaine impairs the gene-
ration of eCB-LTD (Fourgeaud et al, 2004; Mato et al, 2004;
Robbe et al, 2002b). Thus, drugs of abuse may elicit certain
forms of synaptic plasticity in specific circuits while
simultaneously impairing plasticity in other circuits.
Synaptic plasticity in the dorsal striatum has also been
correlated with certain learned behaviors, in particular in
motor control (Gubellini et al, 2004; Pisani et al, 2005). In
this context, it is important to note that two independent
striatal circuits are thought to exist, the so-called ‘direct’
and ‘indirect’ pathways, which subserve different functions
in motor control (Bolam et al, 2000). Indirect pathway
medium spiny neurons (MSNs) project to the lateral globus
pallidus and primarily express D2 dopamine receptors while
direct pathway MSNs project to the substantia nigra and
express D1 dopamine receptors. As mentioned in the
section on eCB-LTD, this form of plasticity is primarily
restricted to the indirect pathway MSNs and is absent in
Parkinson’s disease models (Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007).
However,
in
slices
from
dopamine-depleted
animals,
indirect pathway eCB-LTD can be rescued by a D2 receptor
agonist or pharmacological inhibitors of endocannabinoid
degradation. Remarkably, administration of these drugs
together in vivo dramatically reduces Parkinsonian motor
deficits suggesting that endocannabinoid-mediated depres-
sion of indirect pathway synapses has a critical role in
motor control and may be a valuable target for therapy of
striatal-based brain disorders (Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007).
This works also points out the potential power of examining
the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and placing them in
the context of the neural circuits in which they are found.
Future Directions
We have attempted to briefly review the enormous field of
synaptic plasticity research in a concise and accessible
manner so that by the end of this article, readers will have a
reasonably up to date knowledge of current thinking about
the mechanisms underlying the major forms of synaptic
plasticity in the mammalian brain and a sense of what their
in vivo functions might be. By necessity we have had to
leave out important topics such as how synaptic activity
modulates NMDAR-mediated synaptic responses (eg, Mor-
ishita et al, 2005), inhibitory synaptic responses (Chevaleyre
et al, 2006), or the intrinsic excitability of neurons (Xu and
Kang, 2005; Zhang and Linden, 2003), all of which will have
profound effects on neural circuit function. Furthermore,
several
compelling
examples
that
correlate
long-term
synaptic plasticity with experience-dependent modifications
in behavior have been left out, such as the role of cerebellar
LTD in motor learning (Boyden et al, 2004; Ito, 2002;
Jorntell and Hansel, 2006).
This review should also make clear that while extensive
progress has been made, much remains unknown. Even for
the most established forms of plasticity, NMDAR-depen-
dent LTP and LTD in the CA1 region of the hippocampus,
we
still
know
little
about
the
details
of
the
signal
transduction pathways triggering these forms of plasticity
and which specific proteins are being modified to cause the
changes in synaptic efficacy. We also know little about the
molecular mechanisms underlying the structural changes in
synapses that seem to accompany LTP and LTD. With the
accumulation of evidence demonstrating that long-term
synaptic modifications do in fact play important roles in a
host of adaptive brain functions, we believe there is strong
justification to continue efforts toward establishing the
detailed molecular basis of the various forms of synaptic
plasticity. This is particularly important because, as we have
tried to make clear, such knowledge is likely to have a major
impact on our understanding and treatment of a wide range
of brain disorders.
What direction do we envision the field taking in the near
future? By definition, synaptic plasticity is an electrophy-
siological phenomenon. Only by recording synaptic re-
sponses can the investigator be sure that synaptic function
has been modified. Until relatively recently, most electro-
physiological studies depended on pharmacological manip-
ulations of proteins, an approach that was aided by the use
of genetically modified mice. Thus far, gene knockout
experiments addressing the function of B200 genes have
been reported and close to 80% of these report effects on
synaptic transmission or plasticity (Grant, 2006). With the
growing consensus that NMDAR-dependent LTP is primar-
ily mediated by an increase in postsynaptic AMPARs, while
LTD is associated with loss of AMPARs from the PSD, there
also has been an increased contribution of cell biologists
who have focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying
the changes in the levels of postsynaptic receptors as well as
the changes in synaptic structure that occur. Indeed, a close
interdependence has emerged between electrophysiologists
and cell biologists and this has dramatically impacted the
field. Thus, electrophysiologists are increasingly making use
of tools that enable overexpression, knockdown, and
molecular replacement of target proteins both in vitro and
in vivo (eg, Schluter et al, 2006). These advances are
enabling a true molecular dissection of the mechanisms
underlying plasticity of mammalian brain synapses.
Recent advances in high-throughput technologies, such as
gene-chip microarrays for mRNA profiling and advanced
mass spectrometry for identification of multiple proteins in
a mixed population, have enabled the identification of the
molecular components of many biological phenomena and
contributed significantly to understanding their regulation.
Furthermore, the recent advent of ‘systems biology’ has
contributed a number of conceptual advances that enable
clearer interpretation of the complex interaction networks
observed in signal transduction cascades (Alon, 2006).
These advances have so far only lightly impacted the field of
synaptic plasticity (Pocklington et al, 2006), but we envision
that they will have increasing influence in the near future,
despite the technical difficulties that are encountered when
trying to apply these approaches to the inherently complex
preparations used in the study of synaptic plasticity.
What might we gain from such studies? A clearer picture
of the molecules which participate in the processes under-
lying the different forms of synaptic plasticity, and the
dynamics of their activation and interactions, would enable
the formulation of much more sophisticated models of the
events underlying the triggering, expression, and main-
tenance of specific forms of synaptic plasticity. This in turn
would create a strong foundation for focused efforts aimed
at identifying the central pathways mediating synaptic

plasticity and assaying their relevance to the phenomenon
measured electrophysiologically.
By combining electrophysiological, molecular, cell biolo-
gical and proteomic approaches, we envision that the next
few decades will bring further clarification of the detailed
molecular mechanisms underlying the major forms of
synaptic plasticity that we have discussed in this review.
The use of more sophisticated molecular and genetic
manipulations, in particular, the development of mouse
lines with highly restricted expression of transgenes that
can be turned on or off with fine temporal control, will
simultaneously facilitate the examination of the neural
circuit basis of behavior. Together, we believe these
approaches will allow sophisticated manipulation of synap-
tic plasticity mechanisms in highly restricted neural circuits
and thereby greatly advance our understanding of how
synaptic plasticity mediates both adaptive and pathological
experience-dependent plasticity. Applying these same ap-
proaches to disease models should yield new insights into
the molecular pathology of diseases of the synapse such as
addiction, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s diseases and also
pave the way toward the development of novel and more
efficacious treatments.

Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) infiltrate adipose tissue during obesity and contribute to insulin resis-
tance. We hypothesized that macrophages migrating to adipose tissue upon high-fat feeding may differ from 
those that reside there under normal diet conditions. To this end, we found a novel F4/80+CD11c+ population 
of ATMs in adipose tissue of obese mice that was not seen in lean mice. ATMs from lean mice expressed many 
genes characteristic of M2 or “alternatively activated” macrophages, including Ym1, arginase 1, and Il10. Diet-
induced obesity decreased expression of these genes in ATMs while increasing expression of genes such as 
those encoding TNF-α and iNOS that are characteristic of M1 or “classically activated” macrophages. Interest-
ingly, ATMs from obese C-C motif chemokine receptor 2–KO (Ccr2-KO) mice express M2 markers at levels similar 
to those from lean mice. The antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10, which was overexpressed in ATMs from lean 
mice, protected adipocytes from TNF-α–induced insulin resistance. Thus, diet-induced obesity leads to a shift 
in the activation state of ATMs from an M2-polarized state in lean animals that may protect adipocytes from 
inflammation to an M1 proinflammatory state that contributes to insulin resistance.
Introduction
Recent investigations suggest that obesity gives rise to a state 
of chronic, low-grade inflammation that contributes to insulin 
resistance and type 2 diabetes (1, 2). Although the tissues and cell 
types involved in this inflammatory response are not fully under-
stood, there is significant interest in the role of adipose tissue 
macrophages (ATMs) in the inflammatory changes characteristic 
of obesity (3). In both humans and rodents, ATMs accumulate 
in adipose tissue with increasing body weight and their quantity 
correlates with measures of insulin resistance (4–6). In obese sub-
jects, ATM content is higher in visceral than subcutaneous adi-
pose tissue, consistent with the hypothesis that visceral fat plays 
a more prominent role in insulin resistance (7). Moreover, weight 
loss leads to a reduction in both inflammatory markers and ATM 
content (4, 7). ATMs are a prominent source of proinflammatory 
cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 that can block insulin action in 
adipocytes, providing a potential link between inflammation and 
insulin resistance (6, 8).
Mouse models have demonstrated that ATMs are both neces-
sary and sufficient for the development of insulin resistance with 
obesity. Mice with targeted deletions in the genes for monocyte 
chemoattractant protein–1 (Mcp1/Ccl2) and its receptor C-C motif 
chemokine receptor 2 (Ccr2) both have decreased ATM content, 
decreased inflammation in fat, and protection from high-fat 
diet–induced (HFD-induced) insulin resistance (9, 10). Converse-
ly, mice overexpressing MCP-1 have increased numbers of ATMs 
along with increased insulin resistance (9, 11). Moreover, myeloid-
specific KO of IκB kinase β (Ikbkb) produced mice with improved 
insulin sensitivity on HFD (12). Together, these data suggest that 
both the recruitment and proinflammatory activation of ATMs 
are required for the development of diabetes with obesity.
While quantitative changes in ATM content with obesity and 
diabetes are well supported, little is known about the range of 
ATM function and how this may change with obesity. ATMs are 
present in moderate quantities in adipose tissue of lean mice 
in which inflammatory signals are low or nonexistent (5, 6), 
and their role there is unclear. While Ccr2-KO (CCR2KO) and 
Mcp1-KO mice have lower inflammatory cytokine expression 
in fat, they retain significant macrophage content within adi-
pose tissue (9, 10). This suggests that factors both dependent 
and independent of the MCP-1/CCR2 axis are involved in mac-
rophage recruitment to fat and, further, that not all ATMs are 
programmed for proinflammatory signaling.
Macrophages show significant heterogeneity in function, as local 
environmental factors shape their properties and activation state 
(13, 14). Different stimuli activate macrophages to express distinct 
patterns of chemokines, surface markers, and metabolic enzymes 
that ultimately generate the diversity of macrophage function seen 
in inflammatory and noninflammatory settings. Macrophage acti-
vation has been operationally defined across 2 separate polarization 
states, M1 and M2 (13, 14). These states have largely been defined 
in vitro, and tissue macrophages are likely activated along a con-
tinuum between these states in vivo. M1 or “classically activated” 
macrophages are induced by proinflammatory mediators such as 
LPS and IFN-γ. M1 macrophages have enhanced proinflammatory 
cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12) and generate reactive oxy-
gen species such as NO via activation of iNOS (Nos2).
M2 or “alternatively activated” macrophages are generated in 
vitro by exposure to IL-4 and IL-13 (15). M2 macrophages have 
low proinflammatory cytokine expression and instead generate 
high levels of antiinflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-1 decoy 
receptor. Additionally, arginase production is increased in M2-
polarized macrophages. This enzyme blocks iNOS activity by a 
variety of mechanisms, including competing for the arginine sub-
strate that is required for NO production (16). Overall, M2 mac-

rophages are believed to participate in the blockade of inflam-
matory responses and in the promotion of tissue repair (13). M2 
polarization can occur in the absence of IL-4 or IL-13, suggesting 
that this state may be induced by several different factors (17). 
Moreover, recent studies have shown that IL-4–mediated M2 
polarization is associated with the activation of transcription fac-
tors involved in lipid oxidative metabolism that include PPARγ 
and PPARγ coactivator 1β (PGC-1β) (18).
In mice, distinct monocyte subsets contribute to tissue inflam-
matory responses (13, 19). Noninflamed tissues are populated 
with macrophages derived from CX3CR1hiCCR2– monocytes 
(20). In contrast, acute inflammation increases the levels of 
CX3CR1loCCR2+Ly-6Chi monocytes, which have a higher capac-
ity for migration into inflamed tissues compared with other 
monocyte populations (21). This model is consistent with obser-
vations that CCR2KO mice have decreased ATM content (10), 
presumably due to deficient recruitment of CX3CR1loCCR2+ 
monocytes with retention of the trafficking of CX3CR1hiCCR2– 
monocytes into adipose tissue.
The qualitative differences between these monocyte/macrophage 
subtypes in ATMs and obesity are unknown but may be impor-
tant in understanding the biology of these unique cells and their 
contribution to diabetes. In this regard, we show here that ATMs 
undergo a phenotypic switch from an antiinflammatory M2 polar-
ization state to a proinflammatory M1 polarization state upon 
high-fat feeding, in the process losing their protective capacity.
Results
F4/80+CD11b+CD11c+ macrophages accumulate in fat with diet-induced 
obesity. As the majority of previous studies have used F4/80 expres-
sion as a single marker to identify ATMs, we sought to examine 
ATM heterogeneity in lean and obese mice using additional known 
macrophage markers. Epididymal fat tissue plays a significant role 
in overall metabolism in rodents (22). We thus isolated stromal 
vascular fraction (SVF) cells from epididymal fat pads excised from 
male mice fed a normal diet (ND) or HFD and analyzed cells by 
flow cytometry. ATMs from both lean and obese mice coexpressed 
F4/80 and CD11b, and the majority of the F4/80+CD11b+ cells 
also expressed Mac-3 (data not shown). However, there was varia-
tion in the amount of CD11c expression within the F4/80+CD11b+ 
ATMs. The SVF from lean mice contained 17.8% F4/80+ cells, con-
sistent with other reports (5). Only a small percentage of these cells 
coexpressed CD11c (9.3% ± 7.5%; n = 3 pools of mice) (Figure 1A). 
In contrast, obese mice contained increased F4/80+ cell content 
within the SVF, with a significant increase in the percentage of 
F4/80+CD11c+ cells (38.4% ± 15% of F4/80+ cells; P = 0.04 versus 
lean mice). These cells also expressed CD11b. Similar results were 
seen in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, with 74% of the F4/80+ cells 
coexpressing CD11c (data not shown).

and F4/80+CD11c– cells (1.98 ± 0.42 × 106 cells/mouse versus

fat pads increased in mice fed an HFD compared with lean mice 
(Figure 1B). Normalizing this data to fat pad weight indicated 
that there was a 5.5-fold increase in the content of F4/80+CD11c+ 
cells in adipose tissue from HFD-fed compared with ND mice 
(Figure 1C). In contrast, there was no significant change in the 
quantity of F4/80+CD11c– cells in adipose tissue per milligram 
fat weight between ND and HFD mice. This demonstrates that 
F4/80+CD11c+ cells are a specific population of ATMs recruited 
to fat tissue upon HFD exposure.
Previous studies indicated that targeted deletion of the Ccr2 gene 
results in decreased macrophage content in adipose tissue and 
improved insulin sensitivity (10). Thus, CCR2KO mice were also 
examined for CD11c expression as a complementary mouse model. 
HFD-fed CCR2KO mice demonstrated a reduction in the content 
of F4/80+CD11c+ cells in the SVF compared with wild-type obese 
mice, with 14.4% ± 9.2% of the F4/80+ cells coexpressing CD11c 
(P = 0.08 versus HFD C57BL/6) (Figure 1D). Normalizing for cell 
number and fat weight indicated that there was a greater than 50% 
reduction in the level of F4/80+CD11c+ ATMs in the CCR2KO mice 
(HFD C57BL/6, 2.4 ± 0.46 × 103 cells/mg versus HFD CCR2KO, 
0.88 ± 0.98 × 103 cells/mg) (Figure 1C). The content of total 
F4/80+CD11c+ cells in fat pads from HFD CCR2KO mice was also 
lower than in obese controls after normalization to cell number 
(Figure 1B). Similar to what was observed previously (10), adipo-
cyte size was increased in HFD CCR2KO mice compared with con-
trol HFD mice (mean 7,933 ± 2,754 μm2 versus 6,704 ± 2,961 μm2,  
P = 0.041) and HFD CCR2KO mice were protected from hepatic 
steatosis (data not shown). Contrary to these observations, how-
ever, we noted increased fat pad weight in HFD CCR2KO mice  
(2.83 ± 0.57 g versus control, 1.41 ± 0.25 g; P = 0.011).
Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed the flow cytometry 
results; ND SVF cultures contained only F4/80+CD11c– cells (Fig-
ure 2A). SVF cells from HFD mice showed a mix of F4/80+CD11c+ 
and F4/80+CD11c– cells. Immunohistochemistry on epididymal 
fat pads from obese mice localized CD11c+ cells in macrophage 
clusters surrounding adipocytes (Figure 2B). The CD11c antibody 
stained a subset of cells in these crownlike structures, while F4/80 
stained nearly all of the cells in these clusters. Scattered individual 
CD11c+ ATMs were observed surrounding adipocytes in what may 
have been early ATM clusters (Figure 2C). Rare CD11c+ cells were 
seen in adipose tissue sections from lean mice.
Increased inflammatory gene expression in F4/80+CD11c+ ATMs. 
Because CD11c+ cells appear to accumulate in adipose tissue after 
high-fat feeding, we assessed expression of inflammatory genes in 
F4/80+CD11c+ ATMs compared with F4/80+CD11c– ATMs from 
obese mice. Real-time RT-PCR showed appropriate sorting of the 
CD11c populations based on expression of integrin, alpha X (Itgax, 
encoding CD11c) (Figure 3). F4/80+CD11c+ cells overexpressed 
the inflammatory genes Il6 (IL-6) and Nos2 (iNOS) compared with 
F4/80+CD11c– ATMs. Tnfa (TNF-α) was not differentially expressed 
between the cell types, while Apoe (apoE) was downregulated in the 
F4/80+CD11c+ population relative to F4/80+CD11c– cells.
ATMs from lean mice express markers of alternatively activated mac-
rophages. Given the low level of inflammatory cytokine expression 
in adipose tissue from lean mice, we examined the ATMs derived 
from lean mice for known markers of alternatively activated M2

macrophages (15, 23). ATMs from lean animals showed increased 
expression of M2-specific genes Il10 (IL-10), Arg1 (arginase I), Mrc2 
(mannose receptor, C type 2), Ym1/Chi3l3 (Ym1/chitinase 3–like 3),  
and Mgl1/2 (macrophage galactose N-acetyl-galactosamine–spe-
cific lectins 1 and 2) compared with the ATMs isolated from HFD 
mice (Figure 4A). In contrast, expression of proinflammatory 
genes such as Tnfa and Nos2 was considerably lower in ND ATMs 
compared with ATMs from obese animals (Figure 4B).
As macrophages make up only a portion of the stromal cells in 
adipose tissue, we examined expression of some of these genes in 
unsorted SVF isolates. Similar patterns of gene expression were 
seen in RNA prepared from SVF cells from lean and obese mice 
(Figure 4, C and D), with increased Ym1 and Il10 expression in ND 
mice and increased Tnfa and Nos2 expression in HFD mice.
Since inflammatory macrophage recruitment into fat tissue 
appears to be partially dependent on CCR2 (10), we hypothesized 
that ATMs in obese CCR2KO mice might retain properties of 
M2-polarized macrophages and thus evaluated gene expression 
in these cells. Indeed, ATMs isolated from obese CCR2KO mice 
expressed alternatively activated macrophage markers at levels that 
were similar to those seen in ATMs from lean mice. Furthermore, 
these were significantly elevated compared with levels in ATMs 
from obese mice (Figure 4A).
We confirmed gene expression data by examining protein lev-
els in the ATMs under study. Consistent with the RNA expression 
data, Ym1 was increased in SVF samples from lean compared with 
obese mice (Figure 4E). Additionally, purification of CD11b+ ATMs 
from SVF samples indicated that Ym1 is predominantly expressed 
in ATMs compared with non-macrophage CD11b– cells.
Another characteristic of the alternative macrophage activa-
tion state is increased arginase activity (15). Arginase activity was 
assessed in SVF and adipocyte samples from lean and obese mice. 
While the activity of this enzyme did not differ between the iso-
lated adipocytes from lean and obese mice, arginase activity was 
significantly diminished in the SVF fraction after HFD exposure 
(Figure 4F). This indicates that the arginase/iNOS balance in 
ATMs from lean animals is skewed toward an immunosuppres-
sive state that changes to a proinflammatory state with obesity 
(elevated iNOS and repressed arginase activity).
IL-10 protects adipocytes from the deleterious effects of TNF-α. The 
observation that the expression of Il10 is higher in the SVF and 
ATMs from lean compared with obese mice led us to examine the 
effects of the cytokine on adipocyte function. To explore the cellu-
lar effects of IL-10, we first examined the expression of its receptor. 
The IL-10 receptor α (IL-10Rα) was detected in adipose tissue by 
immunoblotting (Figure 5A). Separation of the SVF from adipo-
cytes in lean and obese animals indicated that the IL-10 receptor 
was expressed primarily in adipocytes, with minimal expression 
in the SVF (Figure 5B). No significant differences were seen in  
IL-10Rα expression between lean and obese mice.
We next examined IL-10 signaling in differentiated 3T3-L1 adi-
pocytes. STAT3 phosphorylation by the IL-10 receptor has been 
shown to be required for its antiinflammatory effects (24). Treat-
ment of adipocytes with IL-10 led to the tyrosine phosphorylation 
of STAT3 within 5 minutes. This effect peaked at 10 minutes and 
declined thereafter (Figure 5C). As IL-10 as been shown to activate 
the PI3K pathway via insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins (25), 
we examined phosphorylation of Akt in response to IL-10. IL-10 
treatment of adipocytes produced the rapid serine phosphoryla-
tion of Akt (Figure 5C).
IL-10 has a variety of antiinflammatory effects in macrophages 
and other cell types that includes the antagonism of the actions of 
TNF-α (26). To examine this in adipocytes, we first analyzed the 
effect of IL-10 on the secretion of the chemokine MCP-1, thought 
to be a major attractant for macrophages in states of obesity (9, 
11, 27). IL-10 treatment for 16 hours decreased MCP-1 secretion 
from adipocytes (Figure 6A). As reports suggest that IL-10 may 
mediate its antiinflammatory effects by antagonizing activation 
of NF-κB–mediated gene transcription (28), we examined the 
effects of IL-10 on TNF-α–stimulated NF-κB activity using an 
NF-κB–responsive luciferase reporter gene. While TNF-α induced 
reporter gene expression, IL-10 had no effect upon this activation 
(data not shown). This is consistent with other reports that show 
that IL-10 can alter the transcriptional rate of inflammatory genes 
independent of NF-κB activation (29).
We next examined the effects of IL-10 on insulin signal 
transduction in adipocytes in concert with TNF-α. Treatment 
of cells with TNF-α for 6 hours dramatically reduced the levels 
of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) protein, with a smaller reduc-
tion in the level of insulin receptor expression, similar to what has 
been reported previously (30). IL-10 pretreatment prevented the 
TNF-α–induced downregulation of both proteins (Figure 6B). 
Additionally, insulin-stimulated IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation 
was decreased with TNF-α treatment. This inhibitory effect was 
prevented by pretreatment with IL-10 (Figure 6C). IL-10 treat-
ment produced no significant changes in TNF-α–stimulated IRS1 
phosphorylation at Ser307, suggesting that the antagonism of  
TNF-α action by IL-10 occurs either downstream of or in parallel 
to reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1.
To determine whether IL-10 protects adipocytes from the physi-
ological effects of TNF-α, we examined insulin-stimulated glucose 
uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with and without IL-10 pretreatment. 
Treatment of cells with TNF-α for 3 hours produced a significant, 
30%–40% inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Pre-
treatment of the cells with IL-10 for 24 hours blocked these acute 
inhibitory effects of TNF-α (Figure 7A). Prolonged (72-hour), low-
dose TNF-α treatment increased basal glucose uptake but had no 
effect on insulin-stimulated levels, consistent with a dramatic

ditions (31). IL-10 blocked these effects of TNF-α and maintained 
cells in an insulin-sensitive state (Figure 7B). Moreover, insulin-
stimulated glucose uptake was dramatically enhanced in cells 
chronically treated with IL-10 compared with untreated cells.
Discussion
Recent data suggest that obesity may represent a state of chron-
ic, low-grade inflammation and that overnutrition is associated 
with the infiltration of adipose tissue by inflammatory cells (2). 
Although the precise cell types involved in this process remain 
uncertain, evidence is mounting that implicates ATMs as a sig-
nificant contributor to inflammation in obesity and a mediator 
of insulin resistance (3, 9, 32). Because the properties of ATMs are 
not well characterized, we performed a detailed examination of 
ATM subtypes and their gene expression in obese and lean mice. 
Based on the wide range of functions that macrophages display in 
normal and inflamed tissues (33), we hypothesized that ATMs are 
differentially activated depending on the degree of adiposity and, 
further, that in addition to quantitative differences, qualitative 
differences exist between ATMs in lean and obese animals.
We report here that ATMs isolated from white adipose tissue 
from lean animals express hallmarks of polarization toward an 
alternatively activated state (M2), suggesting a potentially ben-
eficial function of these cells. M2 polarization has been described 
in tumor-associated macrophages and parasitic infections and is 
believed to regulate tissue repair and prevent excess inflammation 
(15, 34). The markers of M2-polarized macrophages are still being 
described but include expression of the chitinase family member 
Ym1, the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10, arginase, and surface 
lectins Mgl1 and Mgl2 (15, 23). The genes encoding all of these pro-
teins were overexpressed in ATMs from lean compared with obese 
mice. Moreover, ATMs from obese CCR2KO mice, which display 
significantly lower inflammatory gene expression compared with 
their wild-type counterparts, express M2 markers at levels compa-
rable to those in lean mice. This observation is consistent with the 
evidence that resident tissue macrophages in normal conditions 
are derived from CCR2– monocytes, while macrophages recruited 
to sites of inflammation are derived from CCR2+ monocytes (20).
In the current paradigm of macrophage polarization, the prop-
erties of M2 macrophages contrast with the proinflammatory 
activities of classically activated M1 macrophages. One important 
difference between these polarization states involves the balance 
between arginase and iNOS activities. Arginase and iNOS both uti-
lize l-arginine as a substrate. However, while iNOS generates reac-
tive NO species with microbicidal and proinflammatory effects 
important in immune responses, arginase competes with iNOS for 
arginine as a substrate and generates l-ornithine, an important 
precursor for proline that enhances collagen biosynthesis (16).

Based both on gene expression analysis and direct measurement 
of activity, ATMs from lean mice exhibit enhanced arginase activ-
ity compared with obese mice. This balance in favor of arginase 
may play a critical role in repressing the generation of NO and 
other reactive oxygen species by iNOS and thus maintain adipo-
cyte function and promote tissue repair and remodeling.
The dramatic differences in IL-10 expression in lean compared 
with obese ATMs imply an important role for this cytokine as a 
homeostatic regulator in insulin sensitivity. Acute IL-10 infusion 
was shown to improve insulin sensitivity in whole animals (35), 
suggesting that this molecule may balance the effects of proin-
flammatory cytokines such as TNF-α. In humans, circulating IL-10  
levels correlate with markers of improved insulin sensitivity (36), 
and IL-10 levels increase along with insulin sensitivity after exer-
cise (37). Polymorphisms in the IL-10 promoter associated with low 
IL-10 expression are correlated with increased obesity and insulin 
resistance (38). Additionally, adiponectin has been shown to induce  
IL-10 expression in human leukocytes (39). Studies have also shown 
that in obese humans and rodents, both adipocyte and SVF com-
partments from adipose tissue are significant sources of IL-10 (40). 
As levels of proinflammatory cytokines are increased in obesity, 
this observation is consistent with the hypothesis that a balance 
exists between proinflammatory and antiinflamma-
tory factors that governs adipocyte function.
In vitro studies described here show that IL-10 
protects against TNF-α–dependent insulin resis-
tance in adipocytes. The mechanism underlying 
this effect remains uncertain. In macrophages,  
IL-10 attenuates TNF-α inflammatory signals via 
activation of STAT3 (24) and modulation of inflam-
matory gene transcription rates (29). We have not 
observed changes in TNF-α–stimulated NF-κB acti-
vation with IL-10 in adipocytes, although we did 
observe increased PI3K signaling with the cytokine. 
This observation agrees with previous reports that 
IL-10 can activate PI3K pathways via IRS (25) and 
suggests a possible mechanism by which IL-10 can 
antagonize the deleterious effects of TNF-α on 
insulin signaling in adipocytes.
Obesity leads to a shift in ATM phenotype exem-
plified by increased Tnfa and Nos2 expression, 
both characteristically activated in classically acti-
vated M1 macrophages (4–6). We have identified a 
unique subset of ATMs present only in obese animals that express 
F4/80+CD11b+CD11c+. These cells overexpress inflammatory 
genes compared with F4/80+CD11b+CD11c– ATMs and are the 
major ATM population that accumulates in fat with diet-induced 
obesity. These studies indicate a previously uncharacterized diver-
sity within the ATM population in obese mice that may have 
important functional consequences.
CD11c is a marker for DCs, which primarily function in 
phagocytosis, immune surveillance, and antigen presentation. 
F4/80+CD11c+ DCs have been termed interstitial dendritic cells; 
they were recently described in a kidney network that is believed 
to participate in immune surveillance (41). How these DCs par-
ticipate in inflammatory signals in adipose tissue is unknown. 
It is possible that DC activation is critical to the coordination of 
inflammatory events within fat tissue. An important role for DCs 
in obese adipose tissue is supported by the decreased expression of 
MHC class II genes in CCR2KO mice relative to controls (10). More-

over, we have observed an increased expression of MHC class II  
genes in ATMs specifically recruited to adipose tissue with HFD 
(42). These data suggest that DC-coordinated immunity may be 
crucial to the inflammatory events in adipose tissue that occur 
with obesity. Why such DCs are activated and what antigens they 
respond to is currently unknown.
Examining ATM infiltration into adipose tissue in the context 
of monocyte and macrophage heterogeneity leads us to propose 
a model for ATM biology that incorporates the diversity of these 
cells (Figure 8). In lean animals, resident macrophages are polar-
ized toward an M2 state (high IL-10 and arginase levels) derived 
from CCR2– monocytes that help maintain normal adipocyte 
function, perhaps by promoting tissue repair and angiogenesis in 
adipose tissue. Nutrient excess leads to adipocyte expansion, with 
increased secretion of monocyte chemoattractants that recruit 
inflammatory type CCR2+ monocytes to fat, where they differen-
tiate into M1-polarized activated macrophages and CD11c+ DCs. 
Alternatively activated M2 macrophages may be able to partially 
prevent the activation and accumulation of these classically acti-
vated M1 macrophages (43, 44), and the secretion of IL-10 helps 
protect adipocytes against the deleterious effects of TNF-α and 
related cytokines. However, with increasing adiposity, increased 
proinflammatory signals, continued recruitment of M1-polarized 
CCR2+ monocytes, and accumulation of CD11c+ ATMs all con-
tribute to overwhelm the protective effects of M2 macrophages, 
leading to a dominant role for M1-polarized, classically activated 
macrophages that generate high TNF-α, IL-6, and NO production. 
This model explains observations in obese CCR2KO and Mcp1/
Ccl2-KO mice that retain a population of ATMs with decreased 
inflammatory capacity (9, 10). We suspect that these KOs are 
deficient in the recruitment of CCR2+ monocytes during inflam-
mation in fat tissue, while the trafficking of CCR2– monocytes 
with M2 polarization remains intact. Studies aimed at determin-
ing whether enhancing M2 polarization in ATMs can block diet-
induced insulin resistance will be required in order to test this 
model. One limitation of the data leading to this model is that 
they are largely based on flow cytometric analysis of isolated SVF 
populations after collagenase digestion. This method of separa-
tion is an efficient one but may not fully capture all stromal cells 
from adipose tissue (5).
How diet-induced obesity leads to a change from M2 to M1 
polarization is currently unknown, but the mechanism is likely 
multifactorial. Our data suggest that the MCP-1/CCR2 axis con-
tributes to this polarization. We propose 2 potential models for 
this qualitative change in ATM activation: (a) Obesity may lead 
to an increase in the level of Ly-6ChiCCR2+ circulating monocytes 
that are primed for activation along an M1 polarization pattern. 
Factors such as MCP-1, TNF-α, and free fatty acids that activate 
TLR4 (45) may combine to influence this activation pattern as 
these monocytes enter adipose tissue. This model is supported 
by observations that obesity is associated with changes in acti-
vation state of circulating monocytes toward a more proinflam-
matory phenotype (46, 47). (b) Alternatively, obesity may change 
ATMs in adipose tissue from an M2 toward an M1 phenotype. 
Macrophages are reported to have the potential to switch from 
one polarization state to another depending upon environmental 
stimuli (48). However, this model depends upon a slow turnover 
of ATMs. Studies involving pulse labeling macrophages in vivo 
indicated that ATMs are largely replaced by 8 weeks in HFD-fed 
mice (42). Additionally, we have observed that the ATMs recruit-
ed to adipose tissue in HFD-fed mice overexpress Ccr2 and other 
proinflammatory mediators. These observations are consistent 
with the first hypothesis, according to which obesity leads to the 
recruitment of M1-polarized macrophages that gradually replace 
M2-polarized cells, which represents the default pathway of acti-
vation under lean conditions.
Our study frames ATM biology within the context of other 
known models of inflammation and macrophage recruitment. It 
may be possible to decrease inflammatory signals in adipose tis-
sue by modifying ATMs to retain an M2 polarization or by con-
verting M1 polarized macrophages to M2. Increasing IL-10 levels 
may represent one mechanism through which this could occur, 
since chronic IL-10 secretion can suppress classically activated M1 
macrophages (49). Future investigations will focus on identifying

factors that trigger the phenotypic switch of macrophage polariza-
tion in fat and whether these changes in polarization state are lim-
ited to fat or are generalizable to macrophages in other tissues.
Methods
Materials and reagents. For immunoblots, anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) and 
IRS1 antibodies were purchased from Upstate USA Inc. β-Actin monoclo-
nal antibody was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. GLUT4 antibodies were 
obtained from Alpha Diagnostics International. STAT3, phosphotyrosine-
STAT3, Akt, and phospho-Akt antibodies were purchased from Cell Signal-
ing Technology. Mouse recombinant TNF-α and IL-10 were obtained from 
Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-CD68, anti–IL-10 receptor α antibodies, and MCP-1  
ELISA kits were purchased from R&D Systems. Anti-F4/80 antibodies 
were from Abcam. Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated CD11b and unconjugated 
CD11c and CD11b antibodies were from AbD Serotec. PE-conjugated 
anti–Mac-3, PE/Cy5-conjugated anti-F4/80, APC-conjugated anti-CD11c, 
and isotype antibodies were purchased from eBioscience. Anti-Ym1 anti-
bodies were purchased from StemCell Technologies.
Animals and animal care. Male C57BL/6 mice were rendered insulin resis-
tant by feeding an HFD consisting of 45% of calories from fat (D12451; 
Research Diets Inc.) starting at 8 weeks of age for 20 weeks or indicated 
times. Control mice were fed a standard diet consisting of 4.5% fat (5002; 
LabDiet). ob/obJ mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. 
CCR2KO mice on a C57BL/6 background were kindly provided by S. Kun-
kel (University of Michigan). Animals were housed in a specific pathogen–
free facility with a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle and given free access 
to food and water. All animal use was in compliance with the Institute of 
Laboratory Animal Research Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory 
Animals and approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of 
Animals at the University of Michigan.
Cell culture. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were propagated and differentiated into 
adipocytes as described previously (50). Adipocytes were used in experi-
ments 8–10 days after differentiation. Adherent SVF cells were cultured on 
plastic or glass coverslips in DMEM supplemented with 10% endotoxin-
free FBS. For signaling experiments, the cells were starved overnight in 
0.5% serum media prior to stimulation with IL-10. For chronic treatment 
with IL-10 (20 ng/ml) and TNF-α (3 ng/mL), adipocyte media was replaced 
with fresh media every 24 hours.
SVF isolation and ATM purification. Epididymal fat pads from male 
C57BL/6 mice fed an ND or HFD were excised and minced in PBS with 
calcium chloride and 0.5% BSA. Tissue suspensions were centrifuged 
at 500 g for 5 minutes to remove erythrocytes and free leukocytes. Col-
lagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to 1 mg/ml and incubated at 37°C 
for 20 minutes with shaking. The cell suspension was filtered through a  
100-μm filter and then spun at 300 g for 5 minutes to separate floating 
adipocytes from the SVF pellet. To ensure proper isolation, adipocyte frac-
tions were examined by microscopy before and after plating on plastic to 
detect adherent cells. Samples were digested until adipocyte fractions were 
free of adherent cells by these 2 quality-control methods to ensure recovery 
of the majority of the SVF population.
For cell culture, the pellet containing the SVF cells was resuspended in 
growth media for further experiments. For flow cytometry, the SVF pellet 
was resuspended in 0.5 ml RBC Lysis Buffer (eBioscience) and incubated 
for 5 minutes prior to resuspension in sorting buffer (PBS with 0.5% endo-
toxin-free FBS, 2 mM EDTA, and 25 mM HEPES) at a concentration of 
107 cells/ml. Cells were incubated with Fc Block (BD Biosciences) prior to 
staining with conjugated antibodies for 15 minutes at 4°C followed by 2 
washes in 10× excess of sorting buffer. Cells were resuspended in sorting 
buffer supplemented with DAPI and then analyzed by FACS (FACSAria; BD 
Biosciences). Viable cells were sorted directly into RNA lysis buffer for RNA 
extraction. ATMs were identified by coexpression of F4/80 and CD11b.
Isolation of CD11b+ cells from SVF isolates was performed by magnetic 
immunoaffinity isolation with anti-CD11b antibodies conjugated to 
magnetic beads (MACS; Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were isolated using positive 
selection columns prior to preparation of whole-cell lysates.
Immunofluorescence staining. For immunofluorescence, SVF cells were plat-
ed onto glass coverslips for 2 hours, and nonadherent cells were removed by 
3 washes with PBS. After 24 hours, the cells were fixed by incubation with 
Figure 8
Proposed model for ATM polarization and its function in adipose tissue with progressive obesity. In lean, insulin-sensitive states, ATMs are polar-
ized toward an M2 state with IL-10 and arginase expression. Early during HFD treatment, adipocytes undergo hypertrophy, releasing chemokines 
that induce recruitment of M1-polarized ATMs with low IL-10 expression and increased iNOS and TNF-α production. In these early stages of mild 
obesity with retained insulin sensitivity, M2-polarized resident ATMs are able to partially protect adipocytes from these inflammatory factors and 
may block M1 polarization. With increased adiposity, recruited CCR2+ ATMs form crownlike structures (CLS) and overwhelm the protective effects 
of M2 macrophages, leading to a dominant role for TNF-α and iNOS. These factors generate insulin resistance in adipocytes, activate JNK and 
NF-κB, alter adipokine secretion, and lead to excess circulating levels of free fatty acids due to adipocyte lipolysis and impaired lipogenesis.

Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates were prepared 
by the addition of lysis buffer (150 mM sodium chloride, 50 mM Tris 
pH 8, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 
10 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium 
orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors [complete Mini tablets; Roche 
Applied Science]). Cells were lysed at 4°C for 30 minutes and clarified by 
centrifugation. For immunoprecipitations, lysates were incubated with 
1 μg of anti-IRS1 antibodies overnight at 4°C and immune complexes 
precipitated with Protein A/G–conjugated beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnol-
ogy Inc.). Beads were washed with lysis buffer and resuspended in sample 
buffer. Lysates and immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, 
transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with primary antibod-
ies followed by species-specific HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. 
HRP activity was detected by chemiluminescence.
Immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded adipose tissue 
sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated prior to antigen unmasking 
by boiling in 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0, with 0.05% Tween-20 for 30 
minutes. Sections were blocked in normal serum and incubated with pri-
mary antibodies for durations of 1 hour to overnight. Endogenous HRP 
activity was quenched with incubation with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 
minutes. Secondary antibody staining was performed using the Vecta-
stain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) and detected with 3,3′-diaminoben-
zidine (DAB). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin prior to 
dehydration and coverslip placement.
2-Deoxyglucose uptake assay. Adipocytes were starved in low-glucose 
DMEM with 0.5% serum for 3 hours prior to insulin stimulation. 2-Deoxy-
glucose uptake assays were performed as previously described (51).
Arginase assay. Arginase activity assays were performed as previously 
described (52). Briefly, cells were lysed in 0.1% Triton X-100. Tris-HCl was 
added to 12.5-mM and MnCl2 added to 1-mM final concentration. Argi-
nase was activated by heating for 10 minutes at 56°C, and l-arginine sub-
strate was added to 250-mM final concentration. Reactions were incubated 
at 37°C for 30 minutes and stopped by the addition of H2SO4/H3PO4. 
After addition of α-isonitrosopropiophenone and heating for 30 minutes 
at 95°C, urea production was measured by absorbance at 540 nm and nor-
malized to total protein content.
NF-κB activation assay. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected with lucifer-
ase reporter plasmid pBIIX-luc (containing 2 tandemly repeated NF-κB 
binding sites) along with Renilla luciferase control (100:1; Promega) as 
previously described (51). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were 
treated with vehicle or TNF-α (1 nM) with or without IL-10 (20 ng/ml) for 
16 hours prior to lysis and analysis using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter 
Assay System (Promega). Values were normalized to Renilla activities.
Statistics. Results are presented as the mean ± 1 SD. Statistical analyses 
were conducted using an unpaired 2-tailed Student’s t test, with signifi-
cance set at a P value of less than 0.05.
