EFFECTS OF TOP PREDATOR SPECIES ON DIRECT AND INDIRECT INTERACTIONS IN A FOOD WEB,"Current theory on trophic interactions in food webs assumes thatecologically similar species can be treated collectively as a single functional unit such as a guild or trophic level. This theory implies that all species within that unit transmit identical direct and indirect effects throughout the community. We evaluated this assumption by conducting experiments to compare the direct and indirect effects of three top-predator species, be longing to the same hunting spider guild, on the same species of grasshopper and on old field grasses and herbs. Observations under field conditions revealed that each spiderspecies exhibited different hunting behavior (i.e., sit-and-wait, sit-and-pursue, and active hunting) and occupied different locations within the vegetation canopy. These differences resulted in different direct effects on grasshopper prey. Grasshoppers demonstrated significant be havioral (diet) shifts in the presence of sit-and-wait and sit-and-pursue species but not when faced with actively hunting species. Grasshopper density was significantly reduced byspider species that occupied lower parts of the vegetation canopy (sit-and-pursue and actively hunting species), but it was not significantly reduced by the sit-and-wait spider species that occupied the upper parts of the canopy. These direct effects manifested themselves differ ently in the plant trophic level. The sit-and-wait spider caused indirect effects on plants by changing grasshopper foraging behavior (a trait-mediated effect). The sit-and-pursue spider caused indirect effects by reducing grasshopper density (density-mediated effects); the effects of changes in grasshopper behavior were thus not reflected in the plant trophic level. The actively hunting spiders had strictly density-mediated indirect effects on plants. The study offers mechanistic insight into how predator species within the same guild can have very different trophic effects in food webs. Thus classical modeling approaches that treat all predator species as a single functional unit may not adequately capture biologically relevant details that influence community dynamics.",,0,0.75,3
Dynamic population stage structure due to juvenile–adult asymmetry stabilizes complex ecological communities,"Using food web models that account for juvenile and adult individuals of species, I show that commonly observed differences between juveniles and adults in foraging capacity and predation risk result in larger, more complex communities than predicted by models without stage structure. Based on their species interaction networks these complex and diverse communities would be expected to be unstable, but these destabilizing effects of species interactions are overruled by stabilizing changes in juvenile–adult stage structure. Differences between juvenile and adult individuals hence offer a natural resolution to the diversity–stability enigma of ecological communities.",,0,0.0,1
Higher-Order Interaction between Species Inhibits Bacterial Invasion of a Phototroph-Predator Microbial Community,"The composition of an ecosystem is thought to be important for determining its resistance to invasion. Studies of natural ecosystems, from plant to microbial communities, have found that more diverse communities are more resistant to invasion. In some cases, more diverse communities resist invasion by more completely consuming the resources necessary for the invader. We show that Escherichia coli can successfully invade cultures of the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (phototroph) or the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila (predator) but cannot invade a community where both are present. The invasion resistance of the algae-ciliate community arises from a higher-order interaction between species (interaction modification) that is unrelated to resource consumption. We show that the mode of this interaction is the algal inhibition of bacterial aggregation, which leaves bacteria vulnerable to predation. This mode requires both the algae and the ciliate to be present and provides an example of invasion resistance through an interaction modification.",,0,0.0,1
Multiple predator effects result in risk reduction for prey across multiple prey densities,"Investigating how prey density influences a prey’s combined predation risk from multiple predator species is critical for understanding the widespread importance of multiple predator effects. We conducted experiments that crossed six treatments consisting of zero, one, or two predator species (hellgrammites, greenside darters, and creek chubs) with three treat ments in which we varied the density of mayfly prey. None of the multiple predator effects in our system were independent, and instead, the presence of multiple predator species resulted in risk reduction for the prey across both multiple predator combinations and all three levels of prey density. Risk reduction is likely to have population-level consequences for the prey, resulting in larger prey populations than would be pre dicted if the effects of multiple predator species were independent. For one of the two multiple predator combinations, the magnitude of risk reduction margin ally increased with prey density. As a result, models predicting the combined risk from multiple predator species in this system will sometimes need to account for prey density as a factor influencing per-capita prey death rates.",,0,0.0,1
