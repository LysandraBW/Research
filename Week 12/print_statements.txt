Adjusting Species
Sentence of Final Adjusted Species: However, we present a few possible interpretations of this result: (1) Algae suppresses bacterial invasion by secreting a toxic compound, one that they only begin producing when they sense the presence of bacteria (microbes can be stimulated to emit toxins by presence of other microbes (Kearns and Hunter, 2000))

Adjusting Species
Sentence of Final Adjusted Species: In this linear model, following previous convention (Fenchel, 1980a) we refer to the feeding rate as the per ciliate uptake rate of bacteria at low bacterial densities e.g. F = fmax=U. Second, we claim that the feeding rate of ciliates on bacteria (F) has a value of 1 3 105 mL h1.

Sentence of Final Adjusted Species: The motivation for doing this study was to evaluate the assumption that aggregating species that have putatively similar functional roles into the same guild (e.g., cursorial hunting spiders) is a reasonable starting point for purposes of modeling complex food webs (e.g., Yodzis 1996).

Sentence of Final Adjusted Species: Current theory assumes that these indirect effects emerge either from direct density reductions of herbivores due to predation (Rosenzweig 1973, Oksanen et al. 1981, Carpenter et al. 1985, Menge and Sutherland 1987, Leibold 1989, Schmitz 1992) or from reductions in feeding activity by herbivores to increase vigilance (Abrams 1992, 1995).
