https://doi.org/10.1086/723413,Canonical Host-Pathogen Trade-Offs Subverted by Mutations with Dual Benefits,"Host-parasite coevolution is expected to drive the evolution of genetic diversity because the traits used in arms races—namely, host range and parasite resistance—are hypothesized to trade off with traits used in resource competition. We therefore tested data for several trade-offs among 93 isolates of bacteriophage λ and 51 Escherichia coli genotypes that coevolved during a laboratory experiment. Surprisingly, we found multiple trade-ups (positive trait correlations) but little evidence of several canonical trade-offs. For example, some bacterial genotypes evaded a trade-off between phage resistance and absolute fitness, instead evolving simultaneous improvements in both traits. This was surprising because our experimental design was predicted to expose resistance-fitness trade-offs by culturing E. coli in a medium where the phage receptor, LamB, is also used for nutrient acquisition. On reflection, LamB mediates not one but many trade-offs, allowing for more complex trait interactions than just pairwise trade-offs. Here, we report that mathematical reasoning and laboratory data highlight how trade-ups should exist whenever an evolutionary system exhibits multiple interacting trade-offs. Does this mean that coevolution should not promote genetic diversity? No, quite the contrary. We deduce that whenever positive trait correlations are observed in multidimensional traits, other traits may trade off and so provide the right circumstances for diversity maintenance. Overall, this study reveals that there are predictive limits when data account only for pairwise trait correlations, and it argues that a wider range of circumstances than previously anticipated can promote genetic and species diversity.",0116074f232ccc0abe38fa7d62eb0d6240287de5,False,0.35025879740715027

Theory shows that the positive frequency-dependent effects of such costly errors in mate recognition can dictate species coexistence or exclusion even with countervailing resource competition differences between species. While usually framed in terms of pre-mating or post-zygotic costs, reproductive interference manifests between individual Caenorhabditis nematodes from negative interspecies gametic interactions: sperm cells from interspecies matings can migrate ectopically to induce female sterility and premature death. The potential for reproductive interference to exert population level effects on Caenorhabditis trait evolution and community structure, however, remains unknown.ResultsHere we test whether a species that is superior in individual-level reproductive interference (C. nigoni) can exact negative demographic effects on competitor species that are superior in resource competition (C. briggsae and C. elegans). We observe coexistence over six generations and find evidence of demographic reproductive interference even under conditions unfavorable to its influence. C. briggsae and C. elegans show distinct patterns of reproductive interference in competitive interactions with C. nigoni.ConclusionsThese results affirm that individual level negative effects of reproductive interference mediated by gamete interactions can ramify to population demography, with the potential to influence patterns of species coexistence separately from the effects of direct resource competition.",02b4e51f2488263c9459baf19bef4015ea714fc5,False,0.7221014499664307

Pollination by non‐syrphid flies, such as bee flies (Bombylius major L., Bombyliidae, Diptera), has often been underappreciated. Bee flies represent a diverse group of long‐tongue nectar‐feeding insects that are often reported as generalists who visit flowers indiscriminately. Here, we used individual‐based pollen transport networks to assess patterns of individual foraging in bee flies over two flowering seasons in a diverse co‐flowering community. Using this approach, we uncover the structure (e.g., modular vs. nested) of bee fly individual foraging and the degree of individual specialisation. We further evaluate the role of resource availability (floral abundance) and intraspecific trait variation (proboscis length and body size) in shaping individual specialisation. Overall, bee flies visited 20 different plant species. However, network analysis shows that individuals are more specialised and tend to partition the floral resource as reflected by the high degree of network modularity. Most bee fly individuals concentrate their foraging on only a few floral resources (two to four plant species) suggesting strong niche partitioning in this group of pollinators. This modular foraging pattern was not explained by differences in resource availability over the season. Proboscis length, however, was negatively related to the level of individual specialisation. Individuals with larger proboscis had larger foraging niches (less specialisation) perhaps due to easier access to a wide range of plant species with different floral tube sizes. Overall, our study reveals high individual specialisation and niche partitioning in bee‐fly interactions, mediated by differences in proboscis length, and with important implications for pollen transfer dynamics, plant–plant competition and plant reproductive success in diverse co‐flowering communities.",10738526b7a883caa08d359d83eaabc103b0b988,False,0.8610900044441223

Here we examine the potential that root traits may evolve as a target of selection from interspecific competition using Ipomoea purpurea and I. hederacea, two closely related morning glory species that commonly co-occur in the United States. We show that belowground competitive interactions between the two species can alter the pattern of selection on root traits in each species. Specifically, competition with I. purpurea changes the pattern of selection on root angle in I. hederacea, and competitive interactions with I. hederacea changes the pattern of selection on root size in I. purpurea. However, we did not uncover evidence that intraspecific competition altered the pattern of selection on any root traits within I. hederacea. Overall, our results suggest that belowground competition between closely related species can influence the phenotypic evolution of root traits in natural populations. Our findings provide a microevolutionary perspective of how competitive belowground interactions may impact plant fitness, potentially leading to patterns of plant community structure.",1728c6fcaa718504355c873c75634ff57272ff0d,False,0.842055082321167
https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.14107,Mutualist- and antagonist-mediated selection contribute to trait diversification of flowers,"Flowers are generally short-lived, and they all face a multidimensional challenge because they have to attract mutualists, compel them to vector pollen with minimal investment in rewards, and repel floral enemies during this short time window. Their displays are under complex selection, either consistent or conflicting, to maximize reproductive fitness under heterogeneous environments. The phenological or morphological mismatches between flowers and visitors will influence interspecific competition, resource access, mating success and, ultimately, population and community dynamics. To better understand the effects of the plant visitors on floral traits, it is necessary to determine the functional significance of specific floral traits for the visitors; how plants respond to both mutualists and antagonists through adaptive changes; and to evaluate the net fitness effects of biological mutualisms and antagonism on plants. In this review, we bring together insights from fields as diverse as floral biology, insect behavioral responses, and evolutionary biology to explain the processes and patterns of floral diversity evolution. Then, we discuss the ecological significance of plant responses to mutualists and antagonists from a community perspective, and propose a set of research questions that can guide the research field to integrate studies of plant defense and reproduction.",1da7e68d31be999c2736648eef01200dc5141cb0,False,0.555680513381958
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13487,"Sexual dimorphism driven by intersexual resource competition: Why is it rare, and where to look for it?","Abstract Sexes often differ more obviously in secondary sexual characteristics than in traits that appear naturally selected, despite conceivable benefits to intersexual niche partitioning. Genetic constraints may play a role in limiting sex‐specific niche evolution; however, it is not clear why this limit should apply to naturally selected traits more than those under sexual selection; the latter routinely produces dimorphism. We ask whether ecological factors and/or features of the mating system limit dimorphism in resource use, or conversely, what conditions are the most permissible ones for sexual niche differences. The scale of mating competition and spatial variation in resource availability can help predict sexually dimorphic niches or the lack thereof. We investigate why and when dimorphism might fail to evolve even if genetic covariation between the sexes posed no constraint. Our analytical model incorporates the first aspect of spatial interactions (scale of mating competition). It is followed by simulations that explore broader conditions, including multiple resources with habitat heterogeneity, genetic correlations and non‐Gaussian resource‐use efficiency functions. We recover earlier known conditions for favourable conditions for the evolution of niche partitioning between sexes, such as narrow individual niche and low degrees of genetic constraint. We also show spatial considerations to alter this picture. Sexual niche divergence occurs more readily when local mating groups are small and different resources occur reliably across habitats. Polygyny (medium‐sized or large mating groups) can diminish the prospects for dimorphism even if no genetic constraints are present. Habitat heterogeneity typically also disfavours niche dimorphism but can also lead to polymorphism within a sex, if it is beneficial to specialize to be very competitive in one habitat, even at a cost to performance in the other. Sexual conflict is usually used to explain dimorphic traits or behaviours. Our models highlight that introducing conflict (achieved by switching from monogamy to polygamy) can also be responsible for sexual monomorphism. Under monogamy, males benefit from specializing to consume other resources than what feeds the female best. Polygyny makes males disregard this female benefit, and both sexes compete for the most profitable resource, leading to overlapping niches.",26080d5c546081ccb8a59f012f5435b4053c9eb4,False,0.4972165822982788

Competition and aggression among morphs can contribute to polymorphism maintenance and color badges are useful signals in intraspecific communication, because they convey information about alternative strategies and avoid unnecessary conflicts. This could lead to an uneven spatial distribution of morphs in a population, because the local frequency of each morph establishes the intensity of the competition in that neighborhood, and then the fitness of each male. We used a polymorphic lizard, Podarcis muralis, to assess if aggression varies among morphs under two contrasting hypotheses: a heteromorphic vs. a homomorphic aggression. We used laboratory mirror tests after lizard color manipulation and we verified the results consistency with the analysis of the spatial distribution of morphs in a wild population. Both the experiments confirmed that aggression is morph-specific and notably homomorphic. The adoption of behavioral alternative strategies that minimize risks and costs of unwanted conflicts could facilitate the stable coexistence of the phenotypes and reduce the resource competition. A bias in aggression to like-coloured males would advantage rarer morph, which would suffer less harassment by common morphs and obtain a fitness advantage. This process would be negatively-frequency-dependent and would stabilize polymorphism in the populations, possibly leading to sympatric speciation.",2f38dcf02d539b98631caf4e327260ff376e1f85,False,0.6851083636283875
https://doi.org/10.1137/22m1503099,Similarity Suppresses Cyclicity: Why Similar Competitors Form Hierarchies,"Competitive systems can exhibit both hierarchical (transitive) and cyclic (intransitive) structures. Despite theoretical interest in cyclic competition, which offers richer dynamics, and occupies a larger subset of the space of possible competitive systems, most real-world systems are predominantly transitive. Why? Here, we introduce a generic mechanism which promotes transitivity, even when there is ample room for cyclicity. Consider a competitive system where outcomes are mediated by competitor attributes via a performance function. We demonstrate that, if competitive outcomes depend smoothly on competitor attributes, then similar competitors compete transitively. We quantify the rate of convergence to transitivity given the similarity of the competitors and the smoothness of the performance function. Thus, we prove the adage regarding apples and oranges. Similar objects admit well ordered comparisons. Diverse objects may not. To test that theory, we run a series of evolution experiments designed to mimic genetic training algorithms. We consider a series of canonical bimatrix games and an ensemble of random performance functions that demonstrate the generality of our mechanism, even when faced with highly cyclic games. We vary the training parameters controlling the evolution process, and the shape parameters controlling the performance function, to evaluate the robustness of our results. These experiments illustrate that, if competitors evolve to optimize performance, then their traits may converge, leading to transitivity.",3016ded0bb37b5feef5ee05682bd6aa49c9445dc,False,0.0032362358178943396

While plant disease resistance has traditionally been understood as the trait determined by the plant innate immune system and the pathogen virulence system, recent research underscores the pivotal role of the plant microbiome in disease resistance. Plant-associated microbiomes confer protection against pathogens through direct pathogen inhibition, resource competition, and activation of plant immune responses. Agricultural practices such as crop rotation, intercropping, disease-resistant breeding, biocontrol, and organic farming modulate plant microbiomes, thereby influencing disease resistance. This review synthesizes the latest advancements in understanding the intricate interactions among plants, pathogens, and microbiomes.

Sexual dimorphism driven by intersexual resource competition: Why is it rare, and where to look for it? Journal of Animal Ecology, 00, 1-13. Ecological sexual dimorphism, that is differences between the sexes in traits that are naturally selected as opposed to sexually selected, is gaining increasing attention after having often been dismissed as the 'less-parsimonious' explanation for differences between sexes. One potential driver of ecological sexual dimorphism is intersexual resource competition, in a process analogous to ecological character displacement between species; yet, clear empirical examples are scarce. Li and Kokko present mathematical models that introduce novel pieces to the puzzle: the role of the scale of mating competition and the spatial variation in resource availability. They show that ecological sexual dimorphism evolves when local mating groups are small (e.g. monogamous pairs) and when different resources are homogeneously available across habitats. Counterintuitively, larger mating groups (e.g. polygyny), and consequently higher intralocus sexual conflict, lead to sexual monomorphism. Habitat heterogeneity also leads to overlapping niches, although it can sometimes drive polymorphism within sexes. This study highlights why the conditions for intrasexual resource competition to drive evolution of sexual dimorphism are stringent, even in the absence of genetic constraints or competing species. Crucially, it highlights the importance of considering the mating system and the spatial scale of resource competition for understanding the occurrence of ecological sexual dimorphism, showing a large potential for future work considering different aspects of species' life histories and spatial dynamics.",3f086f7e66cf7a17de08aef7861ed1220b2b34fc,False,0.677118182182312
https://doi.org/10.1137/20m1321012,The Network HHD: Quantifying Cyclic Competition in Trait-Performance Models of Tournaments,"Competitive tournaments appear in sports, politics, population ecology, and animal behavior. All of these fields have developed methods for rating competitors and ranking them accordingly. A tournament is intransitive if it is not consistent with any ranking. Intransitive tournaments contain rock-paper-scissor type cycles. The discrete Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition (HHD) is well adapted to describing intransitive tournaments. It separates a tournament into perfectly transitive and perfectly cyclic components, where the perfectly transitive component is associated with a set of ratings. The size of the cyclic component can be used as a measure of intransitivity. Here we show that the HHD arises naturally from two classes of tournaments with simple statistical interpretations. We then discuss six different sets of assumptions that define equivalent decompositions. This analysis motivates the choice to use the HHD among other existing methods. Success in competition is typically mediated by the traits of the competitors. A trait-performance model assumes that the probability that one competitor beats another can be expressed as a function of their traits. We show that, if the traits of each competitor are drawn independently and identically from a trait distribution then the expected degree of intransitivity in the network can be computed explicitly. Using this result we show that increasing the number of pairs of competitors who could compete promotes cyclic competition, and that increasing the correlation in the performance of $A$ against $B$ with the performance of $A$ against $C$ promotes transitive competition. The expected size of cyclic competition can thus be understood by analyzing this correlation. An illustrative example is provided.",4194f1f304a6c09317fa720c4e43afa7ca92014a,False,0.44487908482551575
https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9792,Life history and habitat do not mediate temporal changes in body size due to climate warming in rodents,"Temporal changes in body size have been documented in a number of vertebrate species, with different contested drivers being suggested to explain these changes. Among these are climate warming, resource availability, competition, predation risk, human population density, island effects and others. Both life history traits (intrinsic factors such as lifespan and reproductive rate) and habitat (extrinsic factors such as vegetation type, latitude and elevation) are expected to mediate the existence of a significant temporal response of body size to climate warming but neither have been widely investigated. Using examples of rodents, we predicted that both life history traits and habitat might explain the probability of temporal response using two tests of this hypothesis. Firstly, taking advantage of new data from museum collections spanning the last 106 years, we investigated geographical and temporal variation in cranial size (a proxy for body size) in six African rodent species of two murid subfamilies (Murinae and Gerbillinae) of varying life history, degree of commensality, range size, and habitat. Two species, the commensal Mastomys natalensis, and the non-commensal Otomys unisulcatus showed significant temporal changes in body size, with the former increasing and the latter decreasing, in relation with climate warming. Commensalism could explain the increase in size with time due to steadily increasing food availability through increased agricultural production. Apart from this, we found no general life history or habitat predictors of a temporal response in African rodents. Secondly, in order to further test this hypothesis, we incorporated our data into a meta-analysis based on published literature on temporal responses in rodents, resulting in a combined dataset for 50 species from seven families worldwide; among these, 29 species showed no significant change, eight showed a significant increase in size, and 13 showed a decline in size. Using a binomial logistic regression model for these metadata, we found that none of our chosen life history or habitat predictors could significantly explain the probability of a temporal response to climate warming, reinforcing our conclusion based on the more detailed data from the six African species.",4399fcf6da6546e6c28af32b1c14e138b96ec2e5,False,0.7018570899963379

A Case–Control Study,"A new postmodern depression type, named “Modern-Type Depression” (MTD), is emerging in Western countries. MTD is often underdiagnosed, mainly due to potentially higher comorbidity with technology-based addictions, including Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD). However, the definition of the relationship between MTD and IGD is still controversial, as few data have been published thus far. In particular, there are no data specifically investigating the prevalence of MTD within Italian young subjects with IGD, as well as their mutual association. Hence, within the SWATCH (Social Withdrawal and TeCno-mediated mental Health issues) project, our study aimed to identify the prevalence of MTD in a sample of Italian young adults who play video games by providing a clinical characterization of MTD within a group of IGD individuals (IGD+) versus a group without IGD (IGD−) who play video games. Our cross-sectional case–control study recruited a sample of 543 Italian young video-gaming players (aged 18–35) from the larger SWATCH database, stratified as IGD+ versus IGD−. Subjects were administered the 22-item Tarumi’s Modern-Type Depression Trait Scale (TACS-22), the Motives for Online Gaming Questionnaire (MOGQ), and the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short Form (IGDS9-SF). Around 21.7% of the total sample was represented by MTD individuals, while within the IGD sample, around 34% of subjects had MTD. Within the MTD group, significantly higher scores at IGDS-9SF (p < 0.001), MOGQ “Escape from reality” (p < 0.001), “Fantasy” (p < 0.001), and MOGQ total score (p = 0.003) were found compared to MTD−. According to the multivariate regression model, controlled for sex and age, higher scores in the TACS-22 were positively predicted by the total score of IGDS9-SF (p = 0.003), the MOGQ “Escape from Reality” subscale (p = 0.014), and MOGQ “Fantasy” (p = 0.011), and negatively predicted by the MOGQ “Competition” subscale (p = 0.035) [F (4538) = 17.265; p < 0.001]. Our findings suggested that MTD displays a strong association with IGD. Video-gaming players who do not have IGD appear to be less prone to MTD; this suggests that further studies could be carried out to specifically investigate whether pathological use of video games could also be determined by the presence of MTD.",4526600b760ac778e1b2b87450f3a5da342532a7,False,0.1423024982213974

Mathematical coinfection models have addressed specific systems, focusing on the criteria leading to stable coexistence or competitive exclusion, however, due to their complexity and nonlinearity, analytical solutions in coinfection models remain rare. Here we study a 2-strain SIS compartmental model with co-infection/co-colonization, incorporating multiple fitness dimensions under the same framework: variation in transmissibility, duration of carriage, pairwise susceptibilities to coinfection, coinfection duration, and transmission priority effects from mixed coinfection. Taking advantage of a singular perturbation approach, under the assumption of strain similarity, we expose how strain dynamics on a slow timescale are explicitly governed by a replicator equation which encapsulates all traits and their interplay. This allows us to predict explicitly not only the final epidemiological outcome of a given 2-player competition, but moreover, their entire frequency dynamics as a direct function of their relative variation and of strain-transcending global parameters. Based on mutual invasion fitnesses, we analyze and report rigorous results on transition phenomena in the 2-strain system, strongly mediated via coinfection prevalence. We show that coinfection is not always a promoter of coexistence; instead, its effect to favour or prevent polymorphism is non-monotonic and depends on the type and level of phenotypic differentiation between strains. This framework offers a deeper analytical understanding of 2-strain competitive games in coinfection, with theoretical and practical applications in epidemiology, ecology and evolution.",454b74faedc5bcb00833ba7832bbfefb5273faf8,False,0.1350838840007782

Quorum sensing-dependent traits of the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa allow it to survive and thrive in the presence of other microbes. Here, we report a unique mechanism that P. aeruginosa employs specifically against Klebsiella pneumoniae to displace it on solid surfaces. Interestingly, P. aeruginosa employs neither proteases nor toxic secondary metabolites against K. pneumoniae. Rhamnolipid biosurfactant under the control of the RhlR quorum sensing system appears to be the primary factor required to displace Klebsiella effectively. Under conditions of iron limitation, both bacteria produce iron-scavenging molecules, while P. aeruginosa also produces rhamnolipid biosurfactant, allowing it to push Klebsiella cells away from the substratum. Our study describes a unique quorum and iron-responsive mechanism in P. aeruginosa to support its own growth during resource competition on a solid surface. IMPORTANCE Competition is common among organisms in nature. Bacteria have been known to deal with their neighbors using toxins and enzymes that kill or disable the latter.

Allelopathy appears to be one of the invasion mechanisms, however, the effects could be masked by resource competition among target plants. The difficulty of distinguishing allelopathy from resource competition among plants has hindered investigations of the role of phytotoxic allelochemicals in plant communities. This has been addressed via experiments conducted in both the greenhouse and laboratory by growing associated plants, Melaleuca ericifolia, Rumex conglomeratus, and model plant, Lactuca sativa at varying densities with the allelopathic plant, P. australis, its litter and leachate of P. australis litter. This study investigated the potential interacting influences of allelopathy and resource competition on plant growth–density relationships.ResultsIn greenhouse, the root exudates mediated effects showed the strongest growth inhibition of M. ericifolia at high density whereas litter mediated results revealed increased growth at medium density treatments compared to low and high density. Again, laboratory experiments related to seed germination and seedling growth of L. sativa and R. conglomeratus exhibited phytotoxicity decreased showing positive growth as plant density increased and vice versa. Overall, the differential effects were observed among experiments but maximum individual plant biomass and some other positive effects on plant traits such as root and shoot length, chlorophyll content occurred at an intermediate density. This was attributed to the sharing of the available phytotoxin among plants at high densities which is compatible to density-dependent phytotoxicity model.ConclusionsThe results demonstrated that plant–plant interference is the combined effect of allelopathy and resource competition with many other factors but this experimental design, target-neighbor mixed-culture in combination of plant grown at varying densities with varying level of phytotoxins, mono-culture, can successfully separate allelopathic effects from competition.",4e5edb95401244c59018627c967ca8d6ede1948b,False,0.8209230303764343

We investigated the role of specificity, relative virulence and relative dose in determining the competitive outcome of multiple infections in the Daphnia magna-Pasteuria ramosa host-parasite system.ResultsWe found that infections by P. ramosa clones (single genotype) were less virulent and produced more spores than infections by P. ramosa isolates (possibly containing multiple genotypes). We also found that two similarly virulent isolates of P. ramosa differed considerably in their within-host competitiveness and their effects on host offspring production when faced with coinfecting P. ramosa isolates and clones. Although the relative virulence of a P. ramosa isolate/clone appears to be a good indicator of its competitiveness during multiple infections, the relative dose may alter the competitive outcome. Moreover, spore counts on day 20 post-infection indicate that the competitive outcome is largely decided early in the parasite’s growth phase, possibly mediated by direct interference or apparent competition.ConclusionsOur results emphasize the importance of epidemiology as well as of various parasite traits in determining the outcome of within-host competition. Incorporating realistic epidemiological and ecological conditions when testing theoretical models of multiple infections, as well as using a wider range of host and parasite genotypes, will enable us to better understand the course of virulence evolution.",5c92e6bccd050b8c2f54433ec2e967c7aa729006,False,0.820052981376648

However, it has also been critiqued for its focus on traits (e.g. well-defined system boundaries) that are increasingly threatened by social and environmental trends. Fisheries are a key example of this challenge. While small-scale fisheries are critically important to the diets and livelihoods of millions, industrial fisheries from developed countries now dominate fishing around the world. While these two systems are governed separately, there is substantial overlap between them, conceptualized as the growing influence of globalization on local common pool resource (CPR) systems. One of the most impactful, but least understood consequences of this convergence are the emerging conflicts and competition between small-scale and industrial fisheries. In these systems, the interaction between small-scale CPRs and globalized commodity chains has meant the creation of a new, hybrid resource system, addressed by neither conventional industrial nor traditional small-scale governance approaches. We use empirical data from 396 cases of interactions at sea between globalized industrial and local small-scale fishers in Ghana from 1984 to 2013 to examine the conditions under which resource users conflict or cooperate, linking them to broader political and economic dynamics across scales. We consider the institutional factors that mediate these interactions, identifying policies to promote cooperative, and avert conflictual incidents. We further consider the long-term effects of these patterns of conflict and cooperation for the resilience or vulnerability of the resource base, the fishers, and the institutions governing the system. We suggest that specific governance arrangements that reduce disparities between groups, promote bridging social capital, and enhance hybrid and cross-scale institutions offer the best potential to govern resource systems where traditional CPRs and market-oriented industries converge.",5d9aae6efa2182b0743dc8455a96b4c3b654d4ad,False,0.008203129284083843

Pygmy grasshoppers (Tetrix subulata) are characterized by extensive polymorphism in colour pattern, morphology, behaviour and physiology. We studied experimental groups founded by different numbers of mothers and found that survival was higher in low than in high density, that survival peaked at intermediate colour morph diversity in high density, and that survival was independent of diversity in low density where competition was less intense. We further demonstrate that survival was enhanced by relatedness, as expected if antagonistic and competitive interactions are discriminately directed towards non-siblings. We therefore also performed behavioural observations and staged encounters which confirmed that individuals recognized and responded differently to siblings than to non-siblings. We conclude that negative effects associated with competition are less manifest in diverse groups, that there is conflicting selection for and against genetic diversity occurring simultaneously, and that diversity and relatedness may facilitate the productivity and ecological success of groups of interacting individuals.",65769989315f89c770907d78a483a56ef9121154,False,0.7050389647483826

Arctic char (Salvelinus sp.) are a Holarctic fish often forming morphologically, and sometimes genetically, divergent morphs. In this study, we assessed the morphological and genetic diversity and divergence of 263 individuals from seven populations of arctic char with varying length‐frequency distributions across two distinct groups of lakes in northern Alaska. Despite close geographic proximity, each lake group occurs on landscapes with different glacial ages and surface water connectivity, and thus was likely colonized by fishes at different times. Across lakes, a continuum of physical (e.g., lake area, maximum depth) and biological characteristics (e.g., primary productivity, fish density) exists, likely contributing to characteristics of present‐day char populations. Although some lakes exhibit bimodal size distributions, using model‐based clustering of morphometric traits corrected for allometry, we did not detect morphological differences within and across char populations. Genomic analyses using 15,934 SNPs obtained from genotyping by sequencing demonstrated differences among lake groups related to historical biogeography, but within lake groups and within individual lakes, genetic differentiation was not related to total body length. We used PERMANOVA to identify environmental and biological factors related to observed char size structure. Significant predictors included water transparency (i.e., a primary productivity proxy), char density (fish·ha‐1), and lake group. Larger char occurred in lakes with greater primary production and lower char densities, suggesting less intraspecific competition and resource limitation. Thus, char populations in more productive and connected lakes may prove more stable to environmental changes, relative to food‐limited and closed lakes, if lake productivity increases concomitantly. Our findings provide some of the first descriptions of genomic characteristics of char populations in arctic Alaska, and offer important consideration for the persistence of these populations for subsistence and conservation.",6c9ac6acbc37f6cd41f706e39d12d5a9fbe96a8d,False,0.89472496509552

In a recent review article written for Science, Scott Carroll et al. take on the now monumental task of synthesizing the many ways that evolutionary biology can be used to address global challenges (Carroll et al. 2014). They comprehensively explore the main problems being tackled with an evolutionary approach, ranging from populations evolving too quickly (such as emerging pathogens or pests evolving resistance to treatment) to populations not evolving quickly enough (for example those being negatively affected by human-mediated change). 
 
The authors begin by identifying what they see as the two key paradigms of applied evolutionary biology: (i) managing contemporary evolution (i.e., manipulating the rapid evolutionary response of short-lived organisms with large population sizes, such as bacterial pathogens) and (ii) altering the phenotype–environment mismatch (i.e., responding to populations of long-lived organisms such as trees that are no longer well adapted to their local environment due to shifts in climatic conditions or changes in biotic interactions). As a great example of such a mismatch, the authors highlight the increasing rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease in the human populations as a result of a more sedentary lifestyle with diets rich in sugars and fat. They then identify a number of promising research avenues that either have addressed or have the potential to address current global challenges, covering a wide range of approaches including the use of genetic engineering to more appropriately match genomes to their environment, the use of ‘refuges’ in agriculture and combination treatments against pests and pathogens to hinder the evolution of resistance, and introducing nonlocal genotypes which are predicted to perform better under given environmental conditions into natural populations to increase local adaptation. 
 
The article nicely separates these conceptual approaches into strategies for slowing unwanted evolution or directly influencing fitness of pests and pathogens, strategies for reducing the mismatch between phenotype and the local environment, and strategies for increasing group performance by selecting on group-level traits. For example, the authors discuss the success of artificially selecting for group yield in agricultural plots rather than individual fitness as a means for decreasing competition among plants. Critically, the piece also emphasizes the need to take a unified approach in meeting international objectives for sustainable development and suggests a need for stricter enforcement of guidelines in order to ensure best practice is achieved despite temptation to put profit or immediate success ahead of sustainable solutions. 
 
Overall, the review acts as a unique and remarkable resource both for researchers and students who are new to the field of applied evolution and those who actively contribute to the field.",72a4ba5a40ffa4c0af3290a32b4a8a30e9ac996b,False,0.35826370120048523

Here, we establish a method for high-throughput phenotyping of mixed cultures, in which the pattern of naturally occurring single-nucleotide polymorphisms in each isolate is used as intrinsic barcodes which can be read out by sequencing. We demonstrate that our method can correctly deconvolute strain proportions in simulated mixed-strain pools. As an experimental test of our method, we perform whole genome sequencing of 66 natural isolates of the thermally dimorphic pathogenic fungus Coccidioides posadasii and infer the strain compositions for large mixed pools of these strains after competition at 37°C and room temperature. We validate the results of these selection experiments by recapitulating the temperature-specific enrichment results in smaller pools. Additionally, we demonstrate that strain fitness estimated by our method can be used as a quantitative trait for genome-wide association studies. We anticipate that our method will be broadly applicable to natural populations of microbes and allow high-throughput phenotyping to match the rate of genomic data acquisition. Author summary The diversity of the gene pool in natural populations encodes a wealth of information about its molecular biology. This is an especially valuable resource for non-model organisms, from humans to many microbial pathogens, lacking traditional genetic approaches. An effective method for reading out this population genetic information is a genome wide association study (GWAS) which searches for genotypes correlated with a phenotype of interest. With the advent of cheap genotyping, high throughput phenotyping is the primary bottleneck for GWAS, particularly for microbes that are difficult to manipulate. Here, we take advantage of the fact that the naturally occurring genetic variation within each individual strain can be used as an intrinsic barcode, which can be used to read out relative abundance of each strain as a quantitative phenotype from a mixed culture. Coccidioides posadasii, the causative agent of Valley Fever, is a fungal pathogen that must be manipulated under biosafety level 3 conditions, precluding many high-throughput phenotyping approaches. We apply our method to pooled competitions of C. posadasii strains at environmental and host temperatures. We identify robustly growing and temperature-sensitive strains, confirm these inferences in validation pooled growth experiments, and successfully demonstrate their use in GWAS.",76f0245d6de36968ca830ea2d1c413059f04f98b,False,0.03296451270580292

This study was conducted in Moso bamboo plantations in Zhejiang Province, China. We measured rhizome-system absorptive roots, leaf properties, and soil nutrient contents to explore acquisition-resorption relationships. We also examined how management practices (abandonment [AM], conventional biennial [CM], and high-intensity annual plus understory planting [HM]) influence the traits and processes in Moso bamboo forests. Key novel findings include: (1) A consistent trade-off emerged for nitrogen [N] (negative relationships between root N absorption and leaf N resorption) but not phosphorus [P]. (2) Principal component analysis revealed root traits economics structured along two axes: first (PC1), specific root length [SRL]and root tissue density [RTD] (root lifespan) and second (PC2), cortex thickness [CT] and branching intensity [BI] (fungal independence). Interestingly, the PC1 was positively correlated with N absorption potential, and negatively correlated with N resorption efficiency. (3) HM significantly enhanced SRL (+75% vs. CM) and resorption efficiency (+23% for N, +37% for P), likely driven by interspecific competition under herb planting. While AM treatment showed relatively slight effects on traits and processes, compared with CM treatment. Our findings advance functional trait theory by decoding how clonal integration reconfigures traditional acquisition-resorption relationships, offering critical insights for bamboo forest management under global change and management.",79791c4ed6ac097f0febcc06d8da43e5d429d19c,False,0.29510945081710815

This realisation has fuelled great interest in the effects of microbes on the health of plant [1–3] and animal hosts [4–6] and has revealed that microbe-mediated protection against infectious disease is a widespread phenomenon (Table 1) [7–11]. Defensive microbes can protect hosts from infection by parasites (including pathogens and parasitoids) by direct or host-mediated means (Box 1). Such protective traits have made these microbes attractive candidates for disease control. In fact, defensive microbes are already being applied in phage therapy and bacteriotherapy for humans, as well as to control vector-borne and agricultural diseases (Table 2). 
 
 
Box 1. Mechanisms of Defensive Microbes 
Direct 
Hyperparasitism or predation: Microbes can parasitise or predate upon the parasite [39]. 
 
Interference competition: Microbes can produce toxic compounds, such as antibiotics or bacteriocins, that may either kill the parasite or reduce its growth rate [40–42]. 
 
Resource competition: Microbes can compete with parasites for host resources [10,42], usually via the rate of resource acquisition [40,41]. 
 
 
Host-mediated 
Host immune-mediation: Microbes can elicit a host immune response to which the parasite is not resistant [40,42]. 
 
Host tolerance-mediation: Microbes can increase the fitness of their host during infection without reducing the fitness of the parasite by enhancing host tolerance (e.g., via tissue damage prevention and/or repair) [43,44].

Despite the impact defensive microbes can have on host and parasite fitness, our current perspective of host–parasite evolution is largely based upon pairwise species interactions [12]. By combining knowledge of defensive microbe–parasite interactions at the mechanistic level with evolutionary theory, we can predict how defensive microbes might alter the evolution of host and parasite traits, such as resistance and virulence. This will not only shape how we understand patterns of host–parasite coevolution in nature but will inform our decisisons in utilising defensive microbes as disease control agents. We propose three potential evolutionary implications of defensive microbes on host–parasite interactions.",7cac63bea8687bd7903e0d5913bf4445c63551c4,False,0.49640902876853943

Yet, when investigating individual differences in behaviour, studies tend to measure animals in isolation from other conspecifics—even in social species. Surprisingly, whether behavioural traits measured in isolation are predictive of individual-level behaviour when in social groups is still poorly understood. Here, we repeatedly measured risk-taking behaviour (i.e. boldness; 741 total trials) in both the presence and absence of conspecifics in a social lizard, the delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata). Further, we manipulated food availability during group trials to test whether the effect of the social environment on risk-taking behaviour was mediated by competition over resources. Using 105 lizards collected from three independent populations, we found that individual risk-taking behaviour was repeatable when measured in either social isolation or within groups both with and without food resources available. However, lizards that were bolder during individual trials were not also bolder when in groups, regardless of resource availability. This was largely driven by individual differences in social behavioural plasticity, whereby individual skinks responded differently to the presence of conspecifics. Together, this resulted in a rank order change of individual behavioural types across the social conditions. Our results highlight the importance of the social environment in mediating animal personality traits across varying levels of resource availability. Further, these findings suggest that behavioural traits when measured in isolation, may not reflect individual variation in behaviour when measured in more ecologically realistic social groups.",8851190ab39fe9072d84202912196e7e0f39bafe,False,0.7867702841758728

The Big Five personality traits significantly impact organizational commitment, and organizational commitment significantly impacts employee performance, in which the organizational commitment serves as a complete mediation. In addition, attitudes towards digital work as quasi-moderating can strengthen the influence of the Big Five personality traits on employee performance.

Its comparative analysis may reveal insight on what shapes shape, being a useful approach when other evidence is lacking. Here we investigated evolutionary patterns of body shape in the highly diverse phytophagous chafers (Scarabaeidae: Pleurosticti), a polyphagous group utilizing different parts of angiosperms. Because the reasons of their successful diversification are largely unknown, we used a phylogenetic tree and multivariate analysis on twenty linear measurements of body morphology including all major Pleurosticti lineages to infer patterns of morphospace covariation and divergence. The chafer's different feeding types resulted to be not distinguishable in the described morphospace which was largely attributed to large occupancy of the morphospace of some feeding types and to multiple convergences of feeding behavior (particularly of anthophagy). Low correlation between molecular and morphological rates of evolution, including significant rate shifts for some lineages, indicated directed selection within feeding types. This is supported by morphospace divergence within feeding types and convergent evolution in Australian Melolonthinae. Traits driving morphospace divergence were extremities and traits linked with locomotion behavior, but also body size. Being highly adaptive for burrowing and locomotion these traits showed major changes in the evolution of pleurostict scarabs. These activities also affected another trait, the metacoxal length, which is highly influenced by key innovations of the metacoxa (extended mesal process, secondary closure) particularly in one lineage, the Sericini. Significant shape divergence between major lineages and a lack of strong differentiation among closely related lineages indicated that the question about the presence or absence of competition-derived directed selection needs to be addressed for different time scales. Striking divergence between some sister lineages at their origin revealed strong driven selection towards morphospace divergence, possibly linked with resource partitioning.",8f995ca8f520dbe5ef3c6c20ca7495a5514467aa,False,0.3036523163318634

However, in this study, we reported the secondary partitioning of oviposition resources without resource competition in the damselfly Ischnura senegalensis. In this species, females show color polymorphism that has been evolved as counteradaptation against sexual conflict. One of the female morphs is a blue-green (andromorph, male-like morph), whereas the other morph is brown (gynomorph). These female morphs showed alternative preferences for oviposition resources (plant tissues); andromorphs used fresh (greenish) plant tissues, whereas gynomorphs used decaying (brownish) plants tissues, suggesting that they chose oviposition resources on which they are more cryptic. In addition, the two-color morphs had different egg morphologies. Andromorphs have smaller and more elongated eggs, which seemed to adapt to hard substrates compared with those of gynomorphs. The resource partitioning in this species is achieved by morphological and behavioral differences between the color morphs that allow them to effectively exploit different resources. Resource partitioning in this system may be a by-product of phenotypic integration with body color that has been sexually selected, suggesting an overlooked mechanism of the evolution of resource partitioning. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary and ecological consequences of such resource partitioning.",96e78d06e4192f4eaface956259023e212fde680,False,0.3243767023086548

In the last 20 years, it has become apparent that small vesicles released by cancer cells, referred to as extracellular vesicles (EVs), are key players in cell–cell communication in the tumor environment, and as a consequence, research in this area has increased dramatically. This review summarizes the recent advances in our understanding of how EVs serve as mediators of communication between cancer cells and with their surroundings in order to promote the acquisition of specific characteristics that permit their aberrant behavior. In addition, we dwell on how EVs aid in the development of drug resistance, which is a frequent cause of treatment failure in chemotherapy. Finally, we discuss an exciting new area of research that envisions harnessing the unique characteristics of EVs for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes (theranostics). Taken together, the available literature suggests that advances in our understanding of EV biology in the next decades will likely be critical to achieving more effective treatments in cancer patients. Abstract Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide despite decades of intense efforts to understand the molecular underpinnings of the disease. To date, much of the focus in research has been on the cancer cells themselves and how they acquire specific traits during disease development and progression. However, these cells are known to secrete large numbers of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are now becoming recognized as key players in cancer. EVs contain a large number of different molecules, including but not limited to proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs, and they are actively secreted by many different cell types. In the last two decades, a considerable body of evidence has become available indicating that EVs play a very active role in cell communication. Cancer cells are heterogeneous, and recent evidence reveals that cancer cell-derived EV cargos can change the behavior of target cells. For instance, more aggressive cancer cells can transfer their “traits” to less aggressive cancer cells and convert them into more malignant tumor cells or, alternatively, eliminate those cells in a process referred to as “cell competition”. This review discusses how EVs participate in the multistep acquisition of specific traits developed by tumor cells, which are referred to as “the hallmarks of cancer” defined by Hanahan and Weinberg. Moreover, as will be discussed, EVs play an important role in drug resistance, and these more recent advances may explain, at least in part, why pharmacological therapies are often ineffective.

Accordingly, adaptive sexual dimorphism depends on mechanisms such as genotype‐by‐sex interaction (G×S) and sex‐specific plasticity to alleviate this constraint. We tested these mechanisms in a population of Xiphophorus birchmanni (sheepshead swordtail), where the intensity of male competition is expected to mediate intersexual conflict over age and size at maturity. Combining quantitative genetics with density manipulations and analysis of sex ratio variation, we confirm that maturation traits are dimorphic and heritable, but also subject to large G×S. Although cross‐sex genetic correlations are close to zero, suggesting sex‐linked genes with important effects on growth and maturation are likely segregating in this population, we found less evidence of sex‐specific adaptive plasticity. At high density, there was a weak trend towards later and smaller maturation in both sexes. Effects of sex ratio were stronger and putatively adaptive in males but not in females. Males delay maturation in the presence of mature rivals, resulting in larger adult size with subsequent benefit to competitive ability. However, females also delay maturation in male‐biased groups, incurring a loss of reproductive lifespan without apparent benefit. Thus, in highly competitive environments, female fitness may be limited by the lack of sex‐specific plasticity. More generally, assuming that selection does act antagonistically on male and female maturation traits in the wild, our results demonstrate that genetic architecture of homologous traits can ease a major constraint on the evolution of adaptive dimorphism.",9f80231e734826e54b28b8cab4545a39bc03d811,False,0.21020738780498505
https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.12.873315,Selection for rapid uptake of scarce or fluctuating resource explains vulnerability of glycolysis to imbalance,"Glycolysis is a conserved central pathway in energy metabolism that converts glucose to pyruvate with net production of two ATP molecules. Because ATP is produced only in the lower part of glycolysis (LG), preceded by an initial investment of ATP in the upper glycolysis (UG), achieving robust start-up of the pathway upon activation presents a challenge: a sudden increase in glucose concentration can throw a cell into a self-sustaining imbalanced state in which UG outpaces LG, glycolytic intermediates accumulate and the cell is unable to maintain high ATP concentration needed to support cellular functions. Such metabolic imbalance can result in “substrate-accelerated death”, a phenomenon observed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes when cells are exposed to an excess of substrate that previously limited growth. Here, we address why evolution has apparently not eliminated such a costly vulnerability and propose that it is a manifestation of an evolutionary trade-off, whereby the glycolysis pathway is adapted to quickly secure scarce or fluctuating resource at the expense of vulnerability in an environment with ample resource. To corroborate this idea, we perform evolutionary simulations of a simplified yeast glycolysis pathway consisting of UG, LG, phosphate transport between a vacuole and a cytosol, and a general ATP demand reaction. The pathway is evolved in constant or fluctuating resource environments by allowing mutations that affect the (maximum) reaction rate constants, reflecting changing expression levels of different glycolytic enzymes. We demonstrate that under limited constant resource, the population evolves to a genotype that is balanced but exhibits strongly imbalanced dynamics under ample resource conditions. Furthermore, when resource availability is fluctuating, the imbalanced phenotype enjoys a fitness advantage over balanced dynamics: when glucose is abundant, imbalanced pathways can quickly accumulate glycolytic intermediate FBP as intracellular storage that is used during periods of starvation to maintain high ATP concentration needed for growth. Our model further predicts that in environments with fluctuating resource, competition for glucose can result in stable coexistence of balanced and imbalanced cells, as well as repeated cycles of population crashes and recoveries that depend on such polymorphism. Overall, we demonstrate the importance of ecological and evolutionary arguments for understanding seemingly maladaptive aspects of cellular metabolism.",a0c808d9d951f18e74e58d16a63218ebfe7ba75b,False,0.2925187051296234

However, it is unclear whether social rank is associated with other traits that also predispose to addiction and whether social status similarly predicts cocaine self-administration in rats.ObjectivesThe objective of this study is to investigate whether social ranking assessed using a resource competition task affects (i) the acquisition, maintenance and reinstatement of cocaine self-administration; (ii) the dopaminergic markers in the striatum; and (iii) the expression of ancillary traits for addiction.MethodsSocial ranking was determined in group-housed rats based upon drinking times during competition for a highly palatable liquid. Rats were then evaluated for cocaine self-administration and cue-induced drug reinstatement or individual levels of impulsivity, anxiety and novelty-induced locomotor activity. Finally, dopamine content, dopamine transporter (DAT) and dopamine D2/D3 (D2/3) receptor binding were measured postmortem in the dorsal and ventral striatum.ResultsRats deemed socially dominant showed enhanced novelty reactivity but were neither more impulsive nor anxious compared with subordinate rats. Dominant rats additionally maintained higher rates of cocaine self-administration but showed no differences in the acquisition, extinction and reinstatement of this behaviour. D2/3 binding was elevated in the nucleus accumbens shell and dorsal striatum of dominant rats when compared to subordinate rats, and was accompanied by elevated DAT and reduced dopamine content in the nucleus accumbens shell.ConclusionsThese findings show that social hierarchy influences the rate of self-administered cocaine but not anxiety or impulsivity in rats.

Traditionally, trade-offs are understood in terms of competition for limited resources among traits within an organism, which could be mediated by signal transduction pathways at the level of cellular metabolism. Nevertheless, trade-offs are also thought to be produced as a consequence of the performance of one activity generating negative consequences for other traits, or the result of genes or pathways that simultaneously regulate two life-history traits in opposite directions (antagonistic pleiotropy), independent of resource allocation. Yet examples of genes with antagonistic effects on life-history traits are limited. This study provides direct evidence for a gene—RLS1, that is involved in increasing survival in nutrient-limiting environments at a cost to immediate reproduction in the single-celled photosynthetic alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Specifically, we show that RLS1 mutants are unable to properly suppress their reproduction in phosphate-deprived conditions. Although these mutants have an immediate reproductive advantage relative to the parental strain, their long-term survival is negatively affected. Our data suggest that RLS1 is a bona fide life-history trade-off gene that suppresses immediate reproduction and ensures survival by downregulating photosynthesis in limiting environments, as part of the general acclimation response to nutrient deprivation in photosynthetic organisms.",ade6e9daf05e6878c69dfb1da090899bac2b8de2,False,0.758966863155365

We use a genetic algorithm approach and an individual’s biomass as a fitness surrogate to explore the foraging strategy diversity of evolving guilds under clonal versus hermaphroditic sexual reproduction. We first present the resource exploitation processes, movement on cellular arrays, and genetic algorithm components of the model. We then discuss their implementation on the Nova software platform. This platform seamlessly combines the dynamical systems modeling of consumer-resource interactions with agent-based modeling of individuals moving over a landscapes, using an architecture that lays transparent the following four hierarchical simulation levels: 1.) within-patch consumer-resource dynamics, 2.) within-generation movement and competition mitigation processes, 3.) across-generation evolutionary processes, and 4.) multiple runs to generate the statistics needed for comparative analyses. The focus of our analysis is on the question of how the biomass production efficiency and the diversity of guilds of foraging strategy types, exploiting resources over a patchy landscape, evolve under clonal versus random hermaphroditic sexual reproduction. Our results indicate greater biomass production efficiency under clonal reproduction only at higher population densities, and demonstrate that polymorphisms evolve and are maintained under random mating systems.

While spatial heterogeneity can generate spatially disruptive selection favoring variation between patches, local competition can lead to locally disruptive selection promoting variation within patches. So far, almost all theory has studied these two processes in isolation. Here, we use mathematical modeling to investigate how resource variation within and between habitats influences the evolution of variation in a consumer population where individuals compete in finite patches connected by dispersal. We find that locally and spatially disruptive selection typically act in concert, favoring polymorphism under a wider range of conditions than when in isolation. But when patches are small and dispersal between them is low, kin competition inhibits the emergence of polymorphism, especially when the latter is driven by local competition for resources. We further use our model to clarify what comparisons between trait and neutral genetic differentiation (QST/FST comparisons) can tell about the nature of selection. Overall, our results help us understand the interaction between two major drivers of polymorphism: locally and spatially disruptive selection, and how this interaction is modulated by the unavoidable effects of kin selection under limited dispersal.",c0e299333e5f144b40ebff1358c9a52b2ec08b4a,False,0.8553945422172546
https://doi.org/10.7551/978-0-262-32621-6-CH005,Coevolution in Hide and Seek: Camouflage and Vision,"Predator-prey interactions are one of the most common coevolutionary dynamics in Nature. We consider a model of the coevolution of prey appearance and predator vision, where a successful result is visually apparent. While using a neurophysiologically-based model of vision and a rich developmental process for prey patterning, we show that predatorprey coevolution can maintain engagement. Backgrounds with large regional differences generally lead to prey that appear as mixtures of the regions. Finally, we find that engagement between predators and prey is supported by greater background complexity. One of the most visually-striking phenomena in predatorprey coevolution is prey crypsis, the ability of prey to avoid detection by predators. Chameleons and cuttlefish take this behavior to the extreme and physically alter their pigmentation to match their environment, which can even be realized synthetically in robots (Morin et al., 2012). However, prey crypsis is often manifested as static pigmentations, such as stationary Turing patterns (Turing, 1952), that are selected for being advantageous in particular environments. Inspired by Bond and Kamil (2002), where blue jays are used to interactively evolve moth phenotypes, we study the effect of background complexity on the coevolution of prey appearance and predator vision. There is an intimate coevolutionary relationship between predator vision and prey appearance. Visual systems are generally adapted for stimuli that exert selective pressure on the organism, such as food, prey, predators, and mates. Even when visual systems have adapted to attenuate visual signals from their relevant stimuli, there is still the challenge of visual attention. Visual attention can be roughly thought of as a way of prioritizing a visual field based on interest. Improper allocation of visual attention can mean the difference between catching dinner or going home hungry. In this research we study the coevolution of prey appearance and visual attention in predators. Prey appearance is evolved via genetic programming, such as in (Sims, 1991a; Reynolds, 2011). Predator vision is evolved using a neurophysiologically-based model of visual attention (Itti and Koch, 2001). We focus on the effects of environmental complexity on this coevolutionary interaction. Merilaita (2003) shows that greater background complexity can increase prey detection times by predators. In even earlier work on background matching in camouflage, it was suggested that visual complexity may favor color polymorphism, because there will often be many polymorphisms that can achieve similar patterns (Endler, 1984). These and other works focus on camouflage via background matching, but there are alternative forms of camouflage, in particular, disruptive colorations. In contrast to background matching, where an entity attempts to blend in with the background, disruptive and distractive colorations are patterns that attempt to draw the observer away from the pattern. Disruptive colorations have been shown to be an effective tool for camouflage when tested against live predators (Schaefer and Stobbe, 2006; Cuthill et al., 2005). A number of visual properties significant to predator-prey interactions have been identified in these contexts, including background complexity, prey contrast, and object density (Dimitrova and Merilaita, 2010, 2012, 2014). In our model, the capacity for complexity in prey is greatly enhanced by utilizing a developmental mechanism to produce color images of moderate dimensions, as compared to previous work which explores the selective favorability of simple patterns (Dimitrova and Merilaita, 2014) or directly-represented greyscale images (Bond and Kamil, 2002). In previous work, we have explored the coevolution of predators and prey (Ficici and Pollack, 1996), finding that such systems are often subject to pathologies such as convergence to mediocre stable states (Ficici and Pollack, 1998), loss of gradient, incorrect focusing, and relativism (Watson and Pollack, 1996). Within the ecology literature, predator-prey systems are commonly studied, including analytical and computational models as well as empirical studies. However, analytical models of predator-prey systems can quickly become infeasible for study as the number of species increases. Furthermore, analysis of phenomena such as predator preference runs into difficulty when accounting for alternative food sources under ecological dynamics (van (a) T = 1 (b) T = 5 (c) T = 10 (d) T = 15 (e) T = 20 (f) T = 25 (g) Prey in context (h) T = 1 (i) T = 5 (j) T = 10 (k) T = 15 (l) T = 20 (m) T = 25 (n) Prey in context (o) T = 1 (p) T = 5 (q) T = 10 (r) T = 15 (s) T = 20 (t) T = 25 (u) Prey in context Figure 1: Time-series of prey morphogenesis. Baalen et al., 2001; Leeuwen and Brännström, 2013). The pathologies of competitive coevolution can be readily explained in the language of predator-prey systems. Loss of gradient, when one population becomes worse such that it no longer exherts selective pressure on the competing population, or better such that the competing population can no longer maintain engagement. Examples of this would include evolutionary advances in a predator-prey ecosystem where prey can achieve greater escape velocities, leading to diminished returns for predators, and in real ecosystems, probably triggering the predators to seek another food source. Incorrect focusing is when members of one population overspecialize in interactions with specific competitors such that they fail to generalize to other competitive interactions and are prone to extinction. Examples of incorrect focusing are not as common in real ecosystems, where a large number of coevolutionary interactions continually apply selective pressure. In competitive coevolutionary interactions, the quality of an individual is a function of its competitors. This relativism in scoring means that an individual that appears to be more fit to an external observer, may be just as fit as a lower quality individual relative to a given set of competitors. In Nature, this is less of an issue for similar reasons to incorrect focusing, there are continual pressures from many aspects of the ecosystem and environment such that these disambiguations will occur infrequently. Predator-Prey Coevolution When simulating predator-prey coevolution, we use a 2population competitive coevolution model. The prey population consists of a set of genetic programs that encode a generative function for their visual appearance. The predator population consists of a set of numerical weights for a saliency detection algorithm. Prey receive points for not being detected, or causing the predator to incorrectly classify the background as prey. Predators receive points based upon the accuracy of how they perceive the environment. There are a number of ways to compute the fitness in coevolving populations. We focus on pairwise competitions. Sims uses best v. best competitive coevolution (Sims, 1994), where each population competes against the best individual of the competing population. However, best v. best can lead to incorrect focusing and disengagement by assigning greater fitness to individuals that overspecialize in defeating the champion competitor. Tournaments can reduce the number of comparisons from O(N) to O(NlogN), but still represent approximations of a full pairwise competition (Angeline and Pollack, 1993). All v. all competitive coevolution reduces the tendency for focusing, but comes at great computational cost. Nevertheless, we compute the complete payoff matrix via all v. all pairwise competitions to facilitate coevolutionary engagement between all species.",cea57702ea9092454b46c8bc83a69d96085f190b,False,0.6304023265838623
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0026599,Cryptic Fitness Advantage: Diploids Invade Haploid Populations Despite Lacking Any Apparent Advantage as Measured by Standard Fitness Assays,"Ploidy varies tremendously within and between species, yet the factors that influence when or why ploidy variants are adaptive remains poorly understood. Our previous work found that diploid individuals repeatedly arose within ten replicate haploid populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and in each case we witnessed diploid takeover within 1800 asexual generations of batch culture evolution in the lab. The character that allowed diploids to rise in frequency within haploid populations remains unknown. Here we present a number of experiments conducted with the goal to determine what this trait (or traits) might have been. Experiments were conducted both by sampling a small number of colonies from the stocks frozen every two weeks (93 generations) during the original experiment, as well through sampling a larger number of colonies at the two time points where polymorphism for ploidy was most prevalent. Surprisingly, none of our fitness component measures (lag phase, growth rate, biomass production) indicated an advantage to diploidy. Similarly, competition assays against a common competitor and direct competition between haploid and diploid colonies isolated from the same time point failed to indicate a diploid advantage. Furthermore, we uncovered a tremendous amount of trait variation among colonies of the same ploidy level. Only late-appearing diploids showed a competitive advantage over haploids, indicating that the fitness advantage that allowed eventual takeover was not diploidy per se but an attribute of a subset of diploid lineages. Nevertheless, the initial rise in diploids to intermediate frequency cannot be explained by any of the fitness measures used; we suggest that the resolution to this mystery is negative frequency-dependent selection, which is ignored in the standard fitness measures used.",eed9dab92d7dcb4ce77af06357c96fd9173c0d0e,False,0.2042447179555893

We conducted a chemical mutagenesis and screen to recover new mutations that affect cell competition between wild-type and RpS3 heterozygous cells. Mutations were identified by whole-genome sequencing, making use of software tools that greatly facilitate the distinction between newly induced mutations and other sources of apparent sequence polymorphism, thereby reducing false-positive and false-negative identification rates. In addition, we utilized iPLEX MassARRAY for genotyping recombinant chromosomes. These approaches permitted the mapping of a new mutation affecting cell competition when only a single allele existed, with a phenotype assessed only in genetic mosaics, without the benefit of complementation with existing mutations, deletions, or duplications. These techniques expand the utility of chemical mutagenesis and whole-genome sequencing for mutant identification. We discuss mutations in the Atm and Xrp1 genes identified in this screen.",f3c6523b6efc82ed141ec89cdd58a8bbcc0f277a,False,0.0008175663533620536
https://doi.org/10.3390/biology12050741,Generation of Herbicide-Resistant Soybean by Base Editing,"Simple Summary Soybean is a prominent grain and oil crop in the world. The production of soybean is threatened by weed competition. Recently, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated base editing, which can cause irreversible nucleotide changes in target loci, has been widely used in basic plant science and breeding. However, until now, herbicide-resistant traits in soybean have not been created by the base editor. The objective of this study was to modify different AHAS homologous alleles by base editor to generate a novel AHAS-inhibiting herbicide-resistant soybean. Our results showed that the GmAHAS4 P180S mutants have apparent resistance to AHAS-inhibiting herbicides, which will be beneficial for weed control in soybean production. Abstract Weeds cause the largest yield loss in soybean production. The development of herbicide-resistant soybean germplasm is of great significance for weed control and yield improvement. In this study, we used the cytosine base editor (BE3) to develop novel herbicide-resistant soybean. We have successfully introduced base substitutions in GmAHAS3 and GmAHAS4 and obtained a heritable transgene-free soybean with homozygous P180S mutation in GmAHAS4. The GmAHAS4 P180S mutants have apparent resistance to chlorsulfuron, flucarbazone-sodium, and flumetsulam. In particular, the resistance to chlorsulfuron was more than 100 times that of with wild type TL-1. The agronomic performance of the GmAHAS4 P180S mutants showed no significant differences to TL-1 under natural growth conditions. In addition, we developed allele-specific PCR markers for the GmAHAS4 P180S mutants, which can easily discriminate homozygous, heterozygous mutants, and wild-type plants. This study demonstrates a feasible and effective way to generate herbicide-resistant soybean by using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated base editing.",ff29c1f5e428404258554d4b3c89431b899885dc,False,0.010367031209170818
