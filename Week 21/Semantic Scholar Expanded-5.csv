These differences can result from interspecies competition leading to character shifts, a process referred to as character displacement. While character displacement is often interpreted as a consequence of genetically fixed trait differences between species, it can also be mediated by phenotypic plasticity in response to the presence of another species. Here, we test whether phenotypic plasticity leads to a shift in proteome allocation during co-occurrence of two bacterial species from the abundant, leaf-colonizing families Sphingomonadaceae and Rhizobiaceae in their natural habitat. Upon mono-colonizing of the phyllosphere, both species exhibit specific and shared protein functions indicating a niche overlap. During co-colonization, quantitative differences in the protein repertoire of both bacterial populations occur as a result of bacterial coexistence in planta. Specifically, the Sphingomonas strain produces enzymes for the metabolization of xylan, while the Rhizobium strain reprograms its metabolism to beta-oxidation of fatty acids fueled via the glyoxylate cycle and adapts its biotin acquisition. We demonstrate the conditional relevance of cross-species facilitation by mutagenesis leading to loss of fitness in competition in planta. Our results show that dynamic character displacement and niche facilitation mediated by phenotypic plasticity can contribute to species coexistence. In this study, the concept of dynamic character displacement among interacting bacterial species from leaf-colonizing families was empirically tested using a proteomics approach. A phenotypic shift towards the utilization of alternative carbon sources was observed during coexistence, thereby minimizing niche overlap.",0250d8de5a0511b8e5f8f4625211ed02b4a6fbdc,True,0.9537636041641236
https://doi.org/10.1038/srep24369,Fine-scale behavioural differences distinguish resource use by ecomorphs in a closed ecosystem,"Temporal differences in habitat use and foraging specialisms between ecomorphs represent aspects of behavioural phenotype that are poorly understood with regard to the origin and maintenance of ecological diversity. We tested the role of behaviour in resource use divergence of two Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) phenotypes, a slim, putatively pelagic-dwelling morph and a robust, putatively littoral-dwelling generalist morph, over an annual cycle, using biotelemetry and stable isotopes. Pelagic morph charr exhibited significantly greater δC13 depletion, concordant with increased zooplanktivory, than for the Littoral morph. Although three-dimensional space-use of the morphs strongly overlapped, on average, the Littoral morph used that habitat 19.3% more than the Pelagic morph. Pelagic morph fish were significantly more active, further from the lake bed and at greater depth than Littoral fish (annual means respectively, Pelagic, 0.069BLs−1, 8.21 m and 14.11 m; Littoral, 0.047BLs−1, 5.87 m and 10.47 m). Patterns of habitat use differed between ecomorphs at key times, such as during autumn and at ice break, likely related to spawning and resumption of intensive foraging respectively. Extensive space-use overlap, but fine-scale differences in habitat use between charr ecomorphs, suggests the importance of competition for generating and maintaining polymorphism, and its potential for promoting reproductive isolation and evolution in sympatry.",04aea2d671ba70122f0c2e0dde8c95e54b84608a,True,0.9881508946418762
https://doi.org/10.3390/d17060421,Seed Traits and Curculio Weevil Infestation: A Study in Quercus mongolica,"Exploring host preference and resource partitioning among seed predator species is essential for understanding the coexistence mechanisms and guiding effective forest pest management. This study aimed to elucidate how seed traits influence infestation dynamics and species interactions, focusing on acorn weevils infesting Quercus mongolica. Species identification and clarification of their evolutionary relationships within the Curculio genus were performed through phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene sequences. The seed infestation patterns were assessed by comparing the infestation rates across various seed size classes. Furthermore, the correlations between the seed morphological traits (length, width, aspect ratio, and weight) and weevil abundance were analyzed. The phylogenetic results revealed well-supported monophyletic clades corresponding to Curculio arakawai and Curculio sikkimensis. This confirmed the clear genetic separation between these two distinct weevil species, thereby substantiating the divergence observed in weevil populations correlated with different seed hosts. The infestation patterns revealed the association of weevil species-specific preferences with seed size: C. arakawai predominantly infested larger acorn seeds, whereas C. sikkimensis predominantly infested smaller acorn seeds. C. sikkimensis favored smaller ones. Both species exhibited positive correlations between abundance and seed length and width in larger seeds; however, the seed weight displayed no significant effect. These results indicate niche differentiation mediated by seed size and morphology, which likely reduced interspecific competition and facilitated coexistence. This study elucidates species-specific host selection patterns in acorn weevils and highlights acorn traits as crucial factors shaping seed predator assemblages. The findings provide valuable insights for developing targeted pest management strategies and supporting sustainable oak forest regeneration.",07808f9ca2a186d5d649471839944b8f2ca81202,True,0.9918982982635498
https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.1838,Biotic interactions shape trait assembly of marine communities across time and latitude,"Assembly processes are highly dynamic with biotic filters operating more intensely at local scales, yet the strength of biotic interactions can vary across time and latitude. Predation, for example, can be stronger at lower latitudes, while competition can intensify at later stages of assembly due to resource limitation. Since biotic filters act upon functional traits of organisms, we explored trait-mediated community assembly in diverse marine assemblages from four regions along the Pacific coast of North and Central America. Using predator exclusion experiments and two assembly stages, we tested the hypotheses that non-random trait patterns would emerge during late assembly at all regions due to competition and at lower latitude regions regardless of assembly stage due to predation. As expected, trait divergence occurred in late assembly but only at higher latitude regions, while in tropical Panama, relaxed predation caused trait divergence during late assembly. Moreover, colonizing trait strategies were common during early assembly while competitive strategies were favoured during late assembly at higher latitude regions. Predation-resistant traits were only favoured in Panama during both assembly stages. Our large-scale manipulative study demonstrates that different biotic interactions across time and latitude can have important consequences for trait assembly.",0b1b88cdf20ca66859eec1b9d8f8b08138980548,True,0.9765257835388184
https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.224824,Conspecific chemical cues drive density-dependent metabolic suppression independently of resource intake,"ABSTRACT Within species, individuals of the same size can vary substantially in their metabolic rate. One source of variation in metabolism is conspecific density – individuals in denser populations may have lower metabolism than those in sparser populations. However, the mechanisms through which conspecifics drive metabolic suppression remain unclear. Although food competition is a potential driver, other density-mediated factors could act independently or in combination to drive metabolic suppression, but these drivers have rarely been investigated. We used sessile marine invertebrates to test how food availability interacts with oxygen availability, water flow and chemical cues to affect metabolism. We show that conspecific chemical cues induce metabolic suppression independently of food and this metabolic reduction is associated with the downregulation of physiological processes rather than feeding activity. Conspecific cues should be considered when predicting metabolic variation and competitive outcomes as they are an important, but underexplored, source of variation in metabolic traits. Summary: Conspecific chemical cues induce metabolic suppression independently of food, and this metabolic reduction is associated with the downregulation of physiological processes rather than feeding activity.",0c5dd6ad9fe6509c596895205ae2a66e9a3c5a5d,True,0.9000982046127319
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029487,Selection against Accumulating Mutations in Niche-Preference Genes Can Drive Speciation,"Our current understanding of sympatric speciation is that it occurs primarily through disruptive selection on ecological genes driven by competition, followed by reproductive isolation through reinforcement-like selection against inferior intermediates/heterozygotes. Our evolutionary model of selection on resource recognition and preference traits suggests a new mechanism for sympatric speciation. We find speciation can occur in three phases. First a polymorphism of functionally different phenotypes is established through evolution of specialization. On the gene level, regulatory functions have evolved in which some alleles are conditionally switched off (i.e. are silent). These alleles accumulate harmful mutations that potentially may be expressed in offspring through recombination. Second mating associated with resource preference invades because harmful mutations in parents are not expressed in the offspring when mating assortatively, thereby dividing the population into two pre-zygotically isolated resource-specialist lineages. Third, silent alleles that evolved in phase one now accumulate deleterious mutations over the following generations in a Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller fashion, establishing a post-zygotic barrier to hybridization.",0e25a18b01af535f7a0fb2621719700201751362,True,0.9805545210838318
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013245,Evolution of foraging behaviour induces variable complexity-stability relationships in mutualist-exploiter-predator communities,"Early ecological theory predicts that complex ecological networks are unstable and are unlikely to persist, despite many empirical studies of such complexity in nature. This inconsistency has fascinated ecologists for decades. To resolve the complexity-stability debate, coupling population dynamics and trait dynamics is considered to be an important way to understand the long-term stability of ecological community assemblages. However, we still do not know how eco-evolutionary feedbacks affect the relationship between complexity and stability in ecologically realistic networks with both antagonistic and mutualistic interactions. Here, we explored an adaptive network model to evaluate how the evolution of foraging preference to determine the relationship between network complexity (i.e., connectance) and stability (i.e., community persistence at steady state) in mutualist-exploiter-predator communities (MEST). Our theoretical results showed: (i) adaptive foraging of the top predator contributes to the stability of mutualism and intermediate intensity of foraging adaptations can lead to chaotic dynamics in a four-species MEST community; (ii) the complexity-stability relationship may show positive monotonic, negative monotonic, peaked and double-peaked patterns in general MEST communities, while the double-peaked pattern is only obtained when both the adaptation intensity and interspecific competition are high. Furthermore, model predictions may be consistent with both the negative monotonic pattern revealed in freshwater communities and the peaked pattern revealed in marine communities. Finally, we infer that foraging adaptations of the top predator may alter positive or/and negative feedback loops (trait-mediated indirect effects) to affect the stability of general MEST communities. Our adaptive network framework may provide an effective way to address the complexity-stability debate in real ecosystems.",0e76d546d355fe15e230cae355a0ac49bc386933,True,0.9951501488685608
https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2103162118,Growth–defense trade-offs shape population genetic composition in an iconic forest tree species,"Significance Genetic diversity is critical for ecological resilience and is maintained when different traits are advantageous in different environments. Traits are not entirely independent, however: When trade-offs occur, selection on one trait may indirectly act on another. Here we examine how environmentally mediated selection for growth interacts with a trade-off between growth and herbivore defense in experimental aspen stands. We show that even an environmentally fixed trait trade-off can lead to real-time divergence in population genetic composition between environments. The underlying growth–defense trade-off led to an eco-evolutionary dynamic wherein high-competition environments selected for fast-growing trees and thus ultimately selected against herbivore resistance. This discovery reveals how patterns of genetic covariation, coupled with environmental variation, can link ecological and evolutionary processes. All organisms experience fundamental conflicts between divergent metabolic processes. In plants, a pivotal conflict occurs between allocation to growth, which accelerates resource acquisition, and to defense, which protects existing tissue against herbivory. Trade-offs between growth and defense traits are not universally observed, and a central prediction of plant evolutionary ecology is that context-dependence of these trade-offs contributes to the maintenance of intraspecific variation in defense [Züst and Agrawal, Annu. Rev. Plant Biol., 68, 513–534 (2017)]. This prediction has rarely been tested, however, and the evolutionary consequences of growth–defense trade-offs in different environments are poorly understood, especially in long-lived species [Cipollini et al., Annual Plant Reviews (Wiley, 2014), pp. 263–307]. Here we show that intraspecific trait trade-offs, even when fixed across divergent environments, interact with competition to drive natural selection of tree genotypes corresponding to their growth–defense phenotypes. Our results show that a functional trait trade-off, when coupled with environmental variation, causes real-time divergence in the genetic architecture of tree populations in an experimental setting. Specifically, competitive selection for faster growth resulted in dominance by fast-growing tree genotypes that were poorly defended against natural enemies. This outcome is a signature example of eco-evolutionary dynamics: Competitive interactions affected microevolutionary trajectories on a timescale relevant to subsequent ecological interactions [Brunner et al., Funct. Ecol. 33, 7–12 (2019)]. Eco-evolutionary drivers of tree growth and defense are thus critical to stand-level trait variation, which structures communities and ecosystems over expansive spatiotemporal scales.",14c9352609fd2cfb8e78eddf51613281890ad75b,True,0.9931265711784364
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2003563,Contrasting impacts of competition on ecological and social trait evolution in songbirds,"Competition between closely related species has long been viewed as a powerful selective force that drives trait diversification, thereby generating phenotypic diversity over macroevolutionary timescales. However, although the impact of interspecific competition has been documented in a handful of iconic insular radiations, most previous studies have focused on traits involved in resource use, and few have examined the role of competition across large, continental radiations. Thus, the extent to which broad-scale patterns of phenotypic diversity are shaped by competition remain largely unclear, particularly for social traits. Here, we estimate the effect of competition between interacting lineages by applying new phylogenetic models that account for such interactions to an exceptionally complete dataset of resource-use traits and social signaling traits for the entire radiation of tanagers (Aves, Thraupidae), the largest family of songbirds. We find that interspecific competition strongly influences the evolution of traits involved in resource use, with a weaker effect on plumage signals, and very little effect on song. Our results provide compelling evidence that interspecific exploitative competition contributes to ecological trait diversification among coexisting species, even in a large continental radiation. In comparison, signal traits mediating mate choice and social competition seem to diversify under different evolutionary models, including rapid diversification in the allopatric stage of speciation.",15ab0c31c232d716ffe48f6a25eac008e2bbe64c,True,0.9780389666557312
https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.71466,Effect of Resource Abundance on Woodland Rodents' Demography at Latitudinal Extremes in Europe,"ABSTRACT Climate change effects on primary productivity are especially evident along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. Some of the species with a fast reproductive cycle strategy and relying on primary productivity may rapidly respond to such changes with alterations to demographic parameters. However, how these bottom‐up effects may emerge in systems with different population dynamics has not been elucidated. We aimed to assess the role of food availability on rodent demography in populations characterised by different dynamics, that is multiannual cycles in Northern European populations and mast‐driven outbreaks in Southern European populations, both driven by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We live‐trapped woodland rodents at these latitudinal extremes in two study systems (Norway, Italy) while deploying control/treatment designs of food manipulation providing ad libitum trophic resource availability, albeit not reflecting the natural resource fluctuations. We applied a multistate open robust design model to estimate population patterns and survival rates while controlling for seasonal variation, intrinsic traits, and co‐occurrence of sympatric species. Yellow‐necked and wood mouse (Apodemus spp.) were sympatric with bank vole ( Clethrionomys glareolus ) in Italy, while only the latter was trapped in Norway. Food provisioning increased both survival and population size of bank vole in Norway, where temperatures are harsher and snow cover persists in winter. In milder Italian habitats, the wood mouse abundance was boosted by food availability, increasing also survival rates (but only in females), whereas the bank vole showed a decrease in both parameters across sexes. We speculate that overabundant food resources may trigger some forms of competition between sympatric wood mouse and bank vole, although other types of interactions, such as predation and parasitism, may also contribute. By manipulating food availability in two systems where rodents have different population dynamics, we showed how resource availability exerted bottom‐up effects on rodent demography, especially in the context of climate change, although being mediated by other intrinsic and extrinsic factors.",1639ff2351a63e233b9d163e7c2cadf5c1d82cbf,True,0.9423165917396544

We investigated the effects of competition regime on the uptake of different N forms by two hygrophytes, Carex thunbergii and Polygonum criopolitanum, by conducting a hydroponic test of excised roots and an in situ experiment in a subtropical wetland ecosystem. The two species were grown either in monocultures or mixtures with various neighbor densities. Root functional traits and N uptake rates of different N forms were measured. Our results showed that N uptake was mainly determined by N form, rather than species identity. Both species were able to use organic N sources, but they took up relatively more N supplied as NO3- than as NH4+ or glycine, irrespective of competition treatments. Both species preferred NO3- when grown in monoculture, but in the presence of competitors, the preference of fast-growing C. thunbergii persisted while P. criopolitanum acquired more NH4+ and glycine, with stronger responses being observed at the highest neighbor density. The hydroponic test suggested that these divergences in N acquisition between two species might be partially explained by different root functional traits. To be specific, N uptake rates were significantly positively correlated with root N concentration and specific root length, but negatively correlated with root dry matter content. Our results implicated that C. thunbergii has a competitive advantage with relatively more stable N acquisition strategy despite a lower N recovery than P. criopolitanum, whereas P. criopolitanum could avoid competition with C. thunbergii via a better access to organic N sources, partly mediated by competition regimes.",1ca37a2a3ff3da1199d17847f1bca294d50c90e1,True,0.9912357926368712

To guide effective conservation policies, it is essential to understand the relationship between species diversity and carbon storage in this unique ecosystem. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the response of aboveground carbon (AGC) to species and functional diversity and their effects on AGC in the Yayu Coffee Forest Biosphere Reserve (YCFBR). Using different plot sizes, we collected vegetation data from the core, buffer, and transitional zones of the reserve. We selected traits related to plant‐life strategy, competition ability, response to disturbances, and climate change. Structural equation models (SEMs) were employed to assess the effects of species diversity, functional diversity, and functional dominance on AGC. Data analysis was conducted using R software. Our results revealed that the effects of species richness on AGC were mediated through functional diversity and functional dominance, as demonstrated by both the full mediation and partial mediation models. This suggests that the selection effects and niche complementarity are mutually exclusive yet equally important for predicting AGC. The findings further indicate that functional diversity and functional dominance together accounted for significant predictors of the AGC by 21% in the YCFBR. From a practical standpoint, findings highlight the importance of conserving species diversity as a means to maintain higher AGC in the tropical moist Afromontane forests. In conclusion, this research significantly contributes to the scientific literature by providing valuable insights into the complex relationship between species diversity and carbon storage. The results emphasize the crucial role of functional diversity and dominance in predicting AGC, underscoring the importance of biodiversity conservation for climate mitigation efforts. These findings have practical implications for the development of effective conservation policies tailored to protect and sustain the carbon storage potential of this unique ecosystem.",22abec31a313ba9e3afc571f6bab5b8c1ec882c8,True,0.9937657713890076
https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.13746,Competitive interactions affect introgression and population viability amidst maladaptive hybridization,"The deliberate release of captive‐bred individuals, the accidental escape of domesticated strains, or the invasion of closely related conspecifics into wild populations can all lead to introgressive hybridization, which poses a challenge for conservation and wildlife management. Rates of introgression and the magnitude of associated demographic impacts vary widely across ecological contexts. However, the reasons for this variation remain poorly understood. One rarely considered phenomenon in this context is soft selection, wherein relative trait values determine success in intraspecific competition for a limiting resource. Here we develop an eco‐genetic model explicitly focussed on understanding the influence of such competitive interactions on the eco‐evolutionary dynamics of wild populations experiencing an influx of foreign/domesticated individuals. The model is applicable to any taxon that experiences natural or human‐mediated inputs of locally maladapted genotypes (‘intrusion’), in addition to phenotype‐dependent competition for a limiting resource (e.g. breeding sites, feeding territories). The effects of both acute and chronic intrusion depended strongly on the relative competitiveness of intruders versus locals. When intruders were competitively inferior, density‐dependent regulation limited their reproductive success (ability to compete for limited spawning sites), which prevented strong introgression or population declines from occurring. In contrast, when intruders were competitively superior, this amplified introgression and led to increased maladaptation of the admixed population. This had negative consequences for population size and population viability. The results were sensitive to the intrusion level, the magnitude of reproductive excess, trait heritability and the extent to which intruders were maladapted relative to locals. Our findings draw attention to under‐appreciated interactions between phenotype‐dependent competitive interactions and maladaptive hybridization, which may be critical to determining the impact captive breeding programmes and domesticated escapees can have on otherwise self‐sustaining wild populations.",26d2ebe06be830fb622c83a09b21bef76271feae,True,0.9948760867118835
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4950,Competition between mixo‐ and heterotrophic ciliates under dynamic resource supply,"The outcome of species competition strongly depends on the traits of the competitors and associated trade‐offs, as well as on environmental variability. Here, we investigate the relevance of consumer trait variation for species coexistence in a ciliate consumer–microalgal prey system under fluctuating regimes of resource supply. We focus on consumer competition and feeding traits, and specifically on the consumer's ability to overcome periods of resource limitation by mixotrophy, that is, the ability of photosynthetic carbon fixation via algal symbionts in addition to phagotrophy. In a 48‐day chemostat experiment, we investigated competitive interactions of different heterotrophic and mixotrophic ciliates of the genera Euplotes and Coleps under different resource regimes, providing prey either continuously or in pulses under constant or fluctuating light, entailing periods of resource depletion in fluctuating environments, but overall providing the same amount of prey and light. Although ultimate competition results remained unaffected, population dynamics of mixotrophic and heterotrophic ciliates were significantly altered by resource supply mode. However, the effects differed among species combinations and changed over time. Whether mixotrophs or heterotrophs dominated in competition strongly depended on the genera of the competing species and thus, species‐specific differences in the minimum resource requirements that are associated with feeding on shared prey, nutrient uptake, light harvesting, and access to additional resources such as bacteria. Potential differences in the curvature of the species' resource‐dependent growth functions may have further mediated the species‐specific responses to the different resource supply modes. Overall, our study demonstrates that genus‐ or species‐specific traits other than that related to nutritional mode may override the relevance of acquired phototrophy by heterotrophs in competitive interactions, and that the potential advantage of photosynthetic carbon fixation of symbiont‐bearing mixotrophs in competition with pure heterotrophs may differ greatly among different mixotrophs, playing out under different environmental conditions and depending on the specific requirements of the species. Complex trophic interactions determine the outcome of competition, which can only be understood by taking on a multidimensional trait perspective.",283cf8989c67d0c0c4e81a1f19e954fe939f24af,True,0.965358316898346

Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) inhabiting stream reaches with different predation regimes have rapidly evolved divergent life history traits. Here, we investigated the effects of both predation and resource availability on guppy trophic niches by evaluating their gut contents, resource standing stocks, and δ15N and δ13C stable isotopes across five streams during the wet season. We found that guppies from low predation (LP) sites had a consistently higher trophic position and proportion of invertebrates in their guts and assimilate less epilithon than guppies from high predation (HP) sites. Higher trophic position was also associated with lower benthic invertebrate availability. Our results suggest that LP guppies could be more efficient invertebrate consumers, possibly as an evolutionary response to greater intraspecific competition for higher quality food. This may be intensified by seasonality, as wet season conditions can alter resource availability, feeding rates, and the intensity of intraspecific competition. Understanding how guppy diets vary among communities is critical to elucidating the role of niche shifts in mediating the link between environmental change and the evolution of life histories.",2b6e7fade1df25e10afca55a0fc82a25c957d0db,True,0.9823307394981384

Higher-order ecological effects beyond pairwise interactions may be key to complex ecosystems, but mechanisms to produce these effects remain poorly understood. Here we model microbial growth and competition to show that higher-order effects can arise from variation in multiple microbial growth traits, such as lag times and growth rates, on a single limiting resource with no other interactions. These effects produce a range of ecological phenomena: an unlimited number of strains can exhibit multistability and neutral coexistence, potentially with a single keystone strain; strains that coexist in pairs do not coexist all together; and a strain that wins all pairwise competitions can go extinct in a mixed competition. Since variation in multiple growth traits is ubiquitous in microbial populations, our results indicate these higher-order effects may also be widespread, especially in laboratory ecology and evolution experiments.Higher-order interactions occur when one species mediates the interaction between two others. Here, the authors model microbial growth and competition to show that higher-order interactions can arise from tradeoffs in growth traits, leading to neutral coexistence and other complex dynamics.",2c00165cc717678ca3cfa47016791380206e1a60,True,0.933366060256958

Understanding the environmental context and species traits that give rise to these divergent outcomes is a major challenge to the generality of both theoretical and applied ecology. In aquatic systems, nutrient-mediated eutrophication has led to major declines in species diversity, motivating us to seek terrestrial analogues using a large-mammal system across 598 000 km2 of the Canadian boreal forest. These forests are undergoing some of the most rapid rates of land-use change on Earth and are home to declining caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations. Using satellite-derived estimates of primary productivity, coupled with estimates of moose (Alces alces) and wolf (Canis lupus) abundance, we used path analyses to discriminate among hypotheses explaining how habitat alteration can affect caribou population growth. Hypotheses included food limitation, resource dominance by moose over caribou, and apparent competition with predators shared between moose and caribou. Results support apparent competition and yield estimates of wolf densities (1.8 individuals 1000 km−2) above which caribou populations decline. Our multi-trophic analysis provides insight into the cascading effects of habitat alteration from forest cutting that destabilize terrestrial predator–prey dynamics. Finally, the path analysis highlights why conservation actions directed at the proximate cause of caribou decline have been more successful in the near term than those directed further along the trophic chain.",2eb292d5549e1aa6b1a5d59e71a8d5fda358326a,True,0.988999605178833

Competitive species must partition their ecological niches for sympatry, while the extent of niche overlaps is mediated by either the ecological traits (e.g., body size differences) or environmental features. We aimed to elucidate the patterns of spatial and temporal niche overlaps in mesocarnivore guilds, which are mediated by their ecological traits, regional environments, and anthropogenic disturbances. We investigated the spatial occurrence and diel activities of six mesocarnivore species and estimated their spatial and temporal overlap indices in various landscapes with different anthropogenic disturbances in central Bulgaria. Statistical modeling demonstrated that spatial overlap among mesocarnivores declined when mesocarnivore pairs were within the same family and when large carnivores (particularly wolves, Canis lupus) were present. Furthermore, we found that the extent of their temporal overlaps was associated with taxonomic and body size differences in mesocarnivore pairs as well as their trophic competitions. Our findings indicated that the intensity of interferences among mesocarnivore species was key for the decline of spatial or temporal niche overlap to relax antagonistic interactions.",3003361b35e6ec7695f569a88a2848e7f2de1a17,True,0.9901580810546876
https://doi.org/10.1111/1749-4877.12543,Palatability and profitability of co-occurring seeds alter indirect interactions among rodent-dispersed trees.,"Beyond direct species interactions, seed dispersal is potentially affected by indirect seed-seed interactions among co-occurring nut-bearing trees which are mediated by scatter-hoarding animals as shared seed dispersers. A relevant question in such systems is to what extent different functional traits related to food palatability and profitability affect the kinds of indirect interactions that occur among co-occurring seeds, and the consequences for seed dispersal. We used field experiments to track seed dispersal with individually-tagged seeds in both monospecific and mixed seed communities. We measured indirect effects based on three seed-seed species pairs from the Family Fagaceae with contrasting seed size, tannin level, and dormancy in a subtropical forest in Southwest China. When all else was equal, the presence of adjacently-placed seeds with contrasting seed traits created different indirect effects measured through a variety of dispersal-related indicators. Apparent mutualism was reciprocal due to increasing seed dispersal in mixed seed patches with mixed differences in seed tannins and dormancy. However, differences in either seed size or dormancy in co-occurring adjacently placed seeds caused apparent competition with reduced seed removal or seed dispersal (distance) in at least one species. Our study supports the hypothesis that different functional traits related to food palatability and profitability in co-occurring seeds modify foraging decisions of scatter-hoarding animals, and subsequently cause indirect effects on seed dispersal among rodent-dispersed trees.

https://doi.org/10.1086/408437,"The Comparative Evolutionary Biology of the Sibling Species, Drosophila melanogaster and D. Simulans","1. D. melanogaster and D. simulans are sibling species; they are morphologically almost identical and genetically very similar. Whereas their sexual behavior patterns are qualitatively similar, hybrids are rarely produced and when they are, they are sterile. 2. Although not all data are in agreement, D. melanogaster generally exhibits more chromosomal, enzyme, and protein polymorphism than does D. simulans. Utilizin this relationship, as well as arguments presented in the literature, one can argue for an association between genetic variability and level of ecological heterogeneity. This association is found for two major environmental variables, temperature and light dependence. 3. On a seasonal basis, D. melanogaster achieves large population numbers early in the summer, as D. simulans does in the autumn. The ratio of D. melanogaster to D. simulans increases with temperature and more importantly, with temperature fluctuation. Macroenvironmental temperature is an important factor involved in numerical changes within the two species. Both species from Brisbane, Queensland, are genetically heterogeneous for resistance to desiccation, with additive genetic effects and directional dominance for resistance, whereas at Melbourne, Victoria, D. melanogaster is similar, but the genetic architecture of D. simulans is additive only. Desiccation resistance in the D. simulans Melbourne population varies cyclically on an annual basis but not in the other populations-apparently different genotypes are selected differentially at different times of the year. Between-species generalizations, as in (2) above, are therefore made difficult because of variations within species. 4. From collections at a vineyard and maturation wine cellar coupled with subsequent laboratory experiments, it is clear that an environment in which D. melanogaster occurs exclusive of D. simulans is one of an alcohol-associated resource. On the other hand, in certain places D. simulans has displaced D. melanogaster, for reasons as yet unknown. 5. In the laboratory, a number of experiments at the intraspecific and interspecific levels show differences in fitness-associated traits, such as viability at different stages of the life cycle, oviposition sites, and pupation sites. The results are difficult to interpret, often being dependent upon strain, temperature, or level of competition. Studies over a series of temperatures assessing fitness parameters for many strains of both species are needed before extrapolation to the natural environment is possible. The same problem occurs when population-cage competition experiments betweeen the two species are considered, although some of these experiments have shown that competition itself is controlled by natural selection. 6. The differences between the two species are, in general, quantitative rather than qualitative, so that, with the exception of alcohol, both species use rather similar environmental resources. The potential for rapid increases in the spring suggests that both species are more r strategists than K strategists. In the wild, while some niches, such as alcohol-associated resources, can be defined, it is imperative to define the resources used in nature in order to achieve a more complete comparative evolutionary biology of the two species. The value of the two species in linking behavior, ecology, and genetics is only just now being realized after over half a century of studying them exclusively in various laboratory containers.",32f6e54727da002c8487406b2f6451d037afe676,True,0.940267026424408

However, few microbial ecological models address this trait, particularly concerning multiple enzyme functional groups that regulate complex biogeochemical processes. Here, we aim to fill this gap by developing a COmpetitive Dynamic Enzyme ALlocation (CODEAL) scheme for six enzyme groups that act as indicators of inorganic nitrogen (N) transformations in the Microbial-ENzyme Decomposition (MEND) model. This allocation scheme employs time-variant allocation coefficients for each enzyme group, fostering mutual competition among the multiple groups. We show that the principle of enzyme cost minimization is achieved by using the substrate’s saturation level as the factor for enzyme allocation, resulting in an enzyme-efficient pathway with minimal enzyme cost per unit metabolic flux. It suggests that the relative substrate availability affects the trade-off between enzyme production and metabolic flux. Our research has the potential to give insights into the nuanced dynamics of the N cycle and inspire the evolving landscape of enzyme-mediated biogeochemical processes in microbial ecological modeling, which is gaining increasing attention.",36b82a6cb9432c6a09c727a4ff606d3e16673c37,True,0.9327369332313538

Biotic relationships can be intra- or interspecific, positive or negative and cover a wide range of interactions, including predation, commensalism, mutualism, competition and parasitism. It is indicated that snake venoms, which are the best studied, attract the greatest attention of researchers. The role of predators in the formation of the structure and functioning of ecosystems is analyzed. It has been established that the predator–prey ecological interaction causes mutual physiological, morphological and behavioral adaptations at the individual, intra- and inter-species levels. It is noted that toxins are important adaptation that arose due to evolution. Representatives of venomous animals are present in every ecosystem, more than 250,000 species of animals use their venom for predation, as well as for defense and survival. Іnformation about the types of poisonous and venomous animals is summarized in the article. The composition of animal venoms and the pathological consequences of their influence are presented. It is noted that the lost of habitats, climate change and biological invasions pose a threat to ecological processes that are associated with the interaction between species. The importance of snakes for ecosystems, their significance for trophic network and regulating pests is highlighted.

Individual traits should mediate the effect of resources, yielding a complex condition-dependent dispersal response. We investigated how experimental food reductions in a food-rich environment around poultry-growing villages interact with individual-traits (age, gender, body-mass) in two sympatric canids, red foxes and golden jackals, to jointly affect emigration propensity and survival during dispersal. Sub-adult foxes emigrated more frequently from the food-rich habitat than from the pristine, food-limited habitat, while adult foxes showed the opposite trend. During dispersal, adults exhibited lower survival while sub-adults did not experience additional mortality costs. Although fox mortality rates increased in response to food reduction, dispersal remained unchanged, while jackals showed strong dispersal response in two of the three repetitions. Jackal survival under food reduction was lowest for the dispersing individuals. While resources are an important dispersal determinant, different age classes and species experience the same resource environment differently and consequently have different motivations, yielding different dispersal responses and consequences.",38fcf6c1c4e6dbd1ef281434623a21e1bf901c95,True,0.9861868023872375

Tropical Tree Growth and Its Response to Climate Anomalies Is Mediated by Neighbourhood Hierarchy and Dissimilarity in Carbon‐ and Water‐Related Traits,"ABSTRACT Taxonomic diversity effects on forest productivity and response to climate extremes range from positive to negative, suggesting a key role for complex interactions among neighbouring trees. To elucidate how neutral interactions, hierarchical competition and resource partitioning between neighbours' shape tree growth and climate response in a highly diverse Amazonian forest, we combined 30 years of tree censuses with measurements of water‐ and carbon‐related traits. We modelled individual tree growth response to climate and neighbourhood to disentangle the relative effect of neighbourhood densities, trait hierarchies and dissimilarities. While neighbourhood densities consistently decreased growth, trait dissimilarity increased it, and both had the potential to influence climate response. Greater water conservatism provided a competitive advantage to focal trees in normal years, but water–spender neighbours reduced this effect in dry years. By underlining the importance of density and trait‐mediated neighbourhood interactions, our study offers a way towards improving predictions of forest dynamics.",392407c5f3c35e8063ac9c4b9aaec6a71886de98,True,0.9554721117019652

However, it is not yet understood whether niche packing is facilitated by higher specialization and reduced niche overlap or, rather, by diffuse competition and increased niche overlap. We combined highly resolved bird-plant interaction networks, bird phylogenies, and plant functional traits to compare dietary niche overlap and foraging frequencies among frugivorous birds at seven sites in the tropical Andes. We quantified niche overlap on the basis of the traits of the plants used by each bird and related it to the degree of niche packing at the different sites. Niche complementarity decreased with increasing niche packing, suggesting that increasingly dense niche packing is facilitated by increased niche overlap. Pairwise niche overlap was mediated by shifts in foraging frequencies away from shared resources, and it decreased with decreasing phylogenetic relatedness and increasing dependence on fruit as resource. Our findings suggest that foraging choices are a key axis of diversification in frugivorous birds and that differences in resource use frequencies are already sufficient to reduce potential competition between ecologically similar species and facilitate niche packing, especially if species differ in their dependence on particular resources.",3d2cf3292a563761899a0c484869b72885bbecb0,True,0.9587525725364684

Using two spatially explicit mating models that analyse the genotypes of seeds and seedlings, we investigated the variation of male and female fecundities within and among three European beech (Fagus sylvatica) stands situated along an altitudinal gradient. Female and male individual fecundity distributions were both skewed in this monoecious species, and we found a higher variance in female as compared to male fecundities. Both female and male fecundities increased with tree size and decreased with density and competition in the neighbourhood, the details of these effects suggesting sex‐specific strategies to deal with the impact of limited resource on fecundity. The studied populations were functionally male‐biased. Among‐individual variations in functional gender were not driven by tree size but by density and competition in the neighbourhood. Femaleness decreased under limited resource availability, an expected consequence of the higher cost of female reproduction. Considering the variation of gene flow and genetic drift across elevation, our results suggest that the adaptive potential could be enhanced by low genetic drift at low elevation, and by high pollen‐mediated gene flow at high elevation. Finally, this study predicts a more efficient response to selection for traits related to male vs. female fitness, for a given selection intensity.",49c1390f4001537dd9c1116be9018f1909b3f900,True,0.9823052287101746
https://doi.org/10.1093/ismeco/ycae148,Distinct phytoplankton size classes respond differently to biotic and abiotic factors,"Abstract The interplay between abiotic (resource supply, temperature) and biotic (grazing) factors determines growth and loss processes in phytoplankton through resource competition and trophic interactions, which are mediated by morphological traits like size. Here, we study the relative importance of grazers, water physics, and chemistry on the daily net accumulation rates (ARs) of individual phytoplankton from natural communities, grouped into six size classes from circa 10 to 500 μm. Using a Random Forest modelling approach and 4 years of daily data from a lake, we find that water temperature is generally a pivotal control of all phytoplankton ARs. At the same time, nutrients and light are important for the smallest and the largest classes. Mesozooplankton abundance is a key predictor of the AR for small phytoplankton, with microzooplankton being important for the middle-size range. In our data, large and small phytoplankton have different (seasonal) blooming patterns: small forms are favoured by low temperature and grazing, and high phosphorus levels. Larger forms show positive ARs at high temperatures and low phosphorus (being relatively insensitive to zooplankton grazing). These results help us understand the opportunities and limitations of using size to explain and model phytoplankton responses to biotic and abiotic environmental change.",5962b975451e1735bb1d7225f46dcc399c118301,True,0.9684449434280396
https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13785,Eco‐evolutionary feedbacks between prey densities and linkage disequilibrium in the predator maintain diversity,"Diversity occurs at multiple scales. Within a single population, there is diversity in genotypes and phenotypes. At a larger scale, within ecological communities, there is diversity in species. A number of studies have investigated how diversity at these two scales influence each other through what has been termed eco‐evolutionary feedbacks. Here we study a three‐species ecological module called apparent competition, in which the predator is evolving in a trait that determines its interaction with two prey species. Unlike previous studies on apparent competition, which employed evolutionary frameworks with very simple genetics, we study an eco‐evolutionary model in which the predator's trait is determined by two recombining diallelic loci, so that its mean and variance can evolve, as well as associations (linkage disequilibrium) between the loci. We ask how eco‐evolutionary feedbacks with these two loci affect the coexistence of the prey species and the maintenance of polymorphisms within the predator species. We uncover a novel eco‐evolutionary feedback between the prey densities and the linkage disequilibrium between the predator's loci. Through a stability analysis, we demonstrate how these feedbacks affect polymorphisms at both loci and, among others, may generate stable cycling.",5c1f5eee4236efd0386a6133a849a9af121aeafb,True,0.9952742457389832
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.4320,Extending trait dispersion across trophic levels: Predator assemblages act as top-down filters on prey communities.,"Studies of community assembly typically focus on the effects of abiotic environmental filters and stabilizing competition on functional trait dispersion within single trophic levels. Predation is a well-known driver of community diversity and composition, yet the role of functionally diverse predator communities in filtering prey community traits has received less attention. We examined functionally diverse communities of predators (fishes) and prey (epifaunal crustaceans) in eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds in two northern California estuaries to evaluate the filtering effects of predator traits on community assembly and how filters acting on predators influence their ability to mediate prey community assembly. Fish traits related to bottom orientation were correlated with more clustered epifauna communities, and epifauna were generally overdispersed while fishes were clustered, suggesting prey may be pushed to disparate areas of trait space to avoid capture by benthic sit-and-wait predators. We also found correlations between the trait dispersions of predator and prey communities that strengthened after accounting for the effects of habitat filters on predator dispersion, suggesting that habitat filtering effects on predator species pools may hinder their ability to affect prey community assembly. Our results present compelling observational evidence that specific predator traits have measurable impacts on the community assembly of prey, inviting experimental tests of predator trait means on community assembly and explicit comparisons of how the relative effects of habitat filters and intraguild competition on predators impact their ability to affect prey community assembly. Integrating our understanding of traits at multiple trophic levels can help us better predict the impacts of community composition on food web dynamics as regional species pools shift with climate change and anthropogenic introductions.",63680b02c30004b280223c9181304595ef222d8a,True,0.9811447858810424
https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aau9460,Herbivores as drivers of negative density dependence in tropical forest saplings,"Herbivores shape tropical forests In tropical forests, high local tree diversity is driven by negative density dependence, a process whereby plant performance is inhibited by closely related neighbors. Negative density dependence could be caused by competition for resources among neighbors or result from shared herbivores and pathogens. Using data from forest plots in Panama, Forrister et al. compared the contributions of these mechanisms. They found no effect of competition, but strong effects of plant chemistry and shared herbivores on coexisting Inga tree species. Science, this issue p. 1213 Damage to saplings by herbivores rather than resource competition maintains local tree diversity in tropical rainforests. Ecological theory predicts that the high local diversity observed in tropical forests is maintained by negative density–dependent interactions within and between closely related plant species. By using long-term data on tree growth and survival for coexisting Inga (Fabaceae, Mimosoideae) congeners, we tested two mechanisms thought to underlie negative density dependence (NDD): competition for resources and attack by herbivores. We quantified the similarity of neighbors in terms of key ecological traits that mediate these interactions, as well as the similarity of herbivore communities. We show that phytochemical similarity and shared herbivore communities are associated with decreased growth and survival at the sapling stage, a key bottleneck in the life cycle of tropical trees. None of the traits associated with resource acquisition affect plant performance, indicating that competition between neighbors may not shape local tree diversity. These results suggest that herbivore pressure is the primary mechanism driving NDD at the sapling stage.",7798c03cafa9bfbb11500d17b9682d26f2a55558,True,0.994260847568512
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12685,Soil‐mediated eco‐evolutionary feedbacks in the invasive plant Alliaria petiolata,"Summary Ecological and evolutionary processes historically have been assumed to operate on significantly different time‐scales. We know now from theory and work in experimental and model systems that these processes can feed back on each other on mutually relevant time‐scales. Here, we present evidence of a soil‐mediated eco‐evolutionary feedback on the population dynamics of an invasive biennial plant, Alliaria petiolata. As populations age, natural selection drives down production of A. petiolata's important antimycorrhizal allelochemical, sinigrin. This occurs due to density‐dependent selection on sinigrin, which is favoured under interspecific, but disfavoured under intraspecific, competition. We show that population stochastic growth rates (λS) and plant densities are positively related to sinigrin concentration measured in seedling roots. This interaction is mediated by sinigrin's positive effect on seedling and summer survival, which are important drivers of λS. Together, these illustrate how the evolution of a trait shaped by natural selection can influence the ecology of a species over a period of just years to decades, altering its trajectory of population growth and interactions with the species in the soil and plant communities it invades. Our findings confirm the predictions that eco‐evolutionary feedbacks occur in natural populations. Furthermore, they improve our conceptual framework for projecting future population growth by linking the variation in plant demography to a critical competitive trait (sinigrin) whose selective advantages decrease as populations age.",7efe0009bcb665ffca2a364f3430092f6af0d834,True,0.9974818229675292

Recent findings suggest that epigenetic modifications are important mediators of such plasticity. However, empirical studies have, so far, mainly focused on plasticity in response to abiotic factors, overlooking the response to competition. We tested for within-generation and transgenerational phenotypic plasticity triggered by plant-plant competition intensity, and tested whether it was mediated via DNA methylation, using the perennial, apomictic herb Taraxacum brevicorniculatum in four coordinated experiments. We then tested the consequences of transgenerational plasticity affecting competitive interactions of the offspring and ecosystem processes such as decomposition. We found that, by promoting differences in DNA methylation, offspring of plants under stronger competition developed faster and presented more resource-conservative phenotypes. Further, these adjustments associated with less degradable leaves which have the potential to reduce nutrient turnover and might, in turn, favour plants with more conservative traits. Greater parental competition enhanced competitive abilities of the offspring by triggering adaptive phenotypic plasticity, and decreased offspring leaf decomposability. Our results suggest that competition-induced transgenerational effects could promote rapid adaptations and species coexistence, and feed back on biodiversity assembly and nutrient cycling.",880647bcc951344f5d6d6ae7beb830838e0aff06,True,0.9738531112670898
https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00497,"When, where and how does microbial community composition matter?","Our planet is experiencing rates of environmental change unprecedented in modern times, and an understanding of how microbes both mediate and respond to these shifts is an important research challenge (De Vries and Shade, 2013). Because of the temporal and spatial scales over which microbes function as well as their extreme diversity, dynamics in microbial structure and processes are typically examined at the community level. However, the factors that drive patterns in microbial structure and function, and the links between them, remain widely debated (Prosser et al., 2007). In this issue, such patterns in microbial communities are further documented for soils, lakes, streams and ocean provinces (Arnosti et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2012; King et al., 2012; Larouche et al., 2012). Additionally, the importance of spatial and temporal dynamics (Armitage et al., 2012; Arnosti et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2012; Larouche et al., 2012) and interactions with macrobiota (King et al., 2012) in driving these patterns is demonstrated. Yet, a central but unanswered question is: “does knowing who is there help us to better understand what they are doing?” Indeed, as shown here by Salles et al. (2012), links between structure and function can often be weak, both at the level of the individual and at the level of the community. Several papers in this special issue, “The Causes and Consequences of Microbial Community Structure,” use empirical or modeling approaches as well as literature reviews to enrich our mechanistic understanding of the controls over the relationship between community structure and ecosystem processes. Specifically, authors address the role of trait distributions and trade-offs, species-species interactions, evolutionary dynamics, community assembly processes and physical controls in affecting “who's there” and “what they are doing.” 
 
Trait-based approaches can provide mechanistic links between community structure and function, and are gaining popularity in microbial ecology (Krause et al., 2014). Importantly, the distribution of traits within a community may affect the relationship between structure and function (Webb et al., 2010). Thus, as highlighted in this issue by Comte et al. (2013), traits can be considered at both the individual and the community level, where trait distributions may have important implications for emergent properties (e.g., redundancy). Indeed, Shade et al. (2012) highlight a variety of traits that may govern the stability of individual organisms, populations and communities including plasticity, tolerance and dormancy. Folse and Allison (2012) used a multi-nutrient, multi-genotype model of enzyme activity, and showed that trait distributions could yield insight into the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function. They found that generalists dominated at low levels of community diversity when rates of enzyme production and enzyme diffusion were lowest. Matias et al. (2013) used a simple microcosm experiment and examined the response of assembled communities to fluctuations in salinity. Their results were somewhat different from Folse and Allison (2012), as they found that community diversity was positively related to productivity and that generalists were more productive and less variable over time. Their work also showed that there did not appear to be a fitness trade-off associated with generalization. Comte et al. (2013) took a novel approach to examine plasticity and redundancy in freshwater bacterioplankton communities, and described explicit metrics to track these traits within community transplant experiments. They showed that plasticity appeared to be an intrinsic community property while redundancy was affected by external environmental factors. Their work also revealed strong relationships between community plasticity and redundancy, with no evidence for trade-offs and a possible co-selection of these attributes. 
 
As well, species-species interactions can affect the relationship between communities and processes. In the model presented by Folse and Allison (2012), the importance of both “coalitions” of complementary organisms and the abundance of “cheaters,” or organisms that use a public good without contributing to its production, increased under high levels of enzyme production. They also found that the presence of cheaters could affect the relationship between biodiversity and function. Fox (2012) offered a cautionary tale in terms of our ability to interpret relationships between abundance and “adaptedness” because of organismal interactions. He used a consumer-resource model to demonstrate that, at medium levels of niche overlap, outcomes of competition can be unpredictable, decoupling relationships between abundance and adaptation. 
 
Evolutionary dynamics can also alter relationships between structure and function. In a Perspectives Article, Choudoir et al. (2012) advocate for population-level approaches to examining microbial community diversity, emphasizing that organisms with exactly the same 16S rRNA gene sequence can exhibit very different ecological dynamics. Indeed, Salles et al. (2012) examined the links between rates of denitrification and phylogenies and highlighted the potential importance of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) by showing that similarity in nirK genes, which are thought to be subject to HGT, is not related to N2O accumulation rates. Furthermore, for nirS and 16S rRNA genes, Salles et al. (2012) showed that there was more explanatory power between structure and function at finer scales of phylogenetic resolution for denitrification and metabolic profiles respectively. Pearce et al. (2012) used metagenomics to examine a soil microbial community from Mars Oasis, Antarctica, and showed that while genera-level diversity was limited, species-level diversity was high. They proposed that this suggests strong selection on the types of taxa that can inhabit this extreme environment combined with high rates of diversification within those lineages. Related, Knope et al. (2012) used a microcosm approach to examine the importance of evolutionary history for diversification in bacteria. They showed that prior exposure to an environmental challenge led to higher rates of diversification. These studies suggest that understanding the coupling of ecological and evolutionary processes is key for interpreting microbial community patterns of structure and function. 
 
Community assembly processes may also alter the relationship between “who's there” and “what they do” (Nemergut et al., 2013). Knope et al. (2012) found that arriving in a community first led to a greater degree of diversification within bacteria, likely because of niche-preemption. Pholchan et al. (2013) used a variety of manipulations to alter microbial community assembly in sludge reactors and showed that relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function in these systems were unpredictable. They hypothesized that the relative importance of stochastic vs. deterministic assembly processes could change the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function. In their comment on the Pholchan manuscript, Knelman and Nemergut (2014) provide a conceptual framework illustrating how assembly, biodiversity and function may be related. Together, these studies provide growing evidence for the importance of assembly processes in determining microbial community properties. 
 
Physical dynamics may also be key in regulating the relationship between structure and function. Schimel and Schaeffer (2012) propose a conceptual framework that highlights a requirement that biological processes need to be rate limiting or fate determining in order for community structure to matter for ecosystem function. For example, they propose that structure is not likely to be relevant for organic matter breakdown in mineral soils, where diffusion is limited and organic particles may be occluded or sorbed to soil surfaces. Likewise, Folse and Allison (2012) demonstrate that rates of diffusion of enzymes can affect community diversity and the relative proportion of generalists to specialists. Their work also showed high rates of diffusion coupled to high rates of production can lead to community bottlenecks and increases in stochasticity. As well, King et al. (2012) found that physical dynamics may also affect biotic relationships. They found that associations between plants and microbial community composition were less pronounced at higher elevations, likely due to an increase in the influence of physical harshness on community composition. 
 
Together, the studies in this special issue highlight the role of a variety of ecological, evolutionary and physical dynamics in microbial community structure and function (Figure ​(Figure1).1). This body of work emphasizes the importance of emergent, aggregate community properties and the role of community dynamics in variations in the strength of the structure-function relationships. As Schimel wrote in 1995 “At a small enough scale, microbial community structure must be a dominant control on ecological processes, but as we move up in scale toward the ecosystem and integrate across many individual communities, the influence of microbial community structures decreases.” Predicting when, where, how, and at what scale microbial communities may respond to environmental changes remains a research priority and these papers present new insights into this challenge.

https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.0504,Trait-mediated competition drives an ant invasion and alters functional diversity,"The assumption that differences in species' traits reflect their different niches has long influenced how ecologists infer processes from assemblage patterns. For instance, many assess the importance of environmental filtering versus classical limiting-similarity competition in driving biological invasions by examining whether invaders’ traits are similar or dissimilar to those of residents, respectively. However, mounting evidence suggests that hierarchical differences between species' trait values can distinguish their competitive abilities (e.g. for the same resource) instead of their niches. Whether such trait-mediated hierarchical competition explains invasions and structures assemblages is less explored. We integrate morphological, dietary, physiological and behavioural trait analyses to test whether environmental filtering, limiting-similarity competition or hierarchical competition explain invasions by fire ants on ant assemblages. We detect both competition mechanisms; invasion success is not only explained by limiting similarity in body size and thermal tolerance (presumably allowing the invader to exploit different niches from residents), but also by the invader's superior position in trait hierarchies reflecting competition for common trophic resources. We find that the two mechanisms generate complex assemblage-level functional diversity patterns—overdispersion in some traits, clustering in others—suggesting their effects are likely missed by analyses restricted to a few traits and composite trait diversity measures.",90c4b430f2d78721be333de757c02376e3d42156,True,0.9622019529342652
https://doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.10596,Selection for domestication favored taxa characterized by fast growth and tolerance of high intraspecific density,"To understand why certain plants have been domesticated into crops, we need to recognize that the environmental conditions plants experience in wild populations are totally different from those of agricultural fields. In this study, we investigated whether the characteristics that promote growth and survival in these different environments may have influenced domestication. Our results revealed that ancestral crops were selected because they developed better than other plants in dense single‐species stands, with selection for increased yield likely occurring after domestication. These insights shed light on the origins of agriculture and offer valuable guidance for future crop breeding efforts.

In spite of a large history of research, it is still unclear which functional traits may have mediated plant domestication. Solving this problem requires consideration of the ecological and demographic disparities between natural plant populations and cultivated fields. Since population density tends to be higher in the latter, we hypothesized that traits facilitating growth and survival in dense, monospecific populations might have been relevant for initial domestication.
We investigated whether functional traits that respond to population density varied across three different domestication stages: undomesticated crop wild relatives, natural populations of crop progenitors, and landraces. To do this, we compared traits influencing competition (lodging; growth rate), resource acquisition (plant height; total aerial and root biomass) and yield (fruit number) in three annual legume crops—lentil, grasspea, and vetch—grown without resource limitation at three different densities.
Our results showed clear differences among species, likely reflective of the distinct uses of the crops and their domestication pathways. Nevertheless, undomesticated relatives consistently differed from crop progenitors and landraces, producing smaller, slower‐growing plants that were more prostrate and allocated less biomass to roots. The effect of selection under domestication on these vegetative traits appeared to be largely negligible. Conversely, landraces produced more fruits.
We conclude that early agriculturalists selected for domestication wild legumes that performed well in dense monocultures and were more effective in resource capture. Later domestication and breeding efforts likely had more significant effects on reproductive traits, such as fruit and seed production.

Intraspecific variation in metabolic rates and, hence, resource demands covary with competitive ability. The effects of metabolism on conspecific interactions, however, have mostly been studied under laboratory conditions. We used a trait‐specific response‐surface design to test for the effects of metabolism on pairwise interactions of the marine colonial invertebrate, Bugula neritina in the field. Specifically, we compared the performance (survival, growth, and reproduction) of focal individuals, both in the presence and absence of a neighbor colony, both of which had their metabolic phenotype characterized. Survival of focal colonies depended on the metabolic phenotype of the neighboring individual, and on the combination of both the focal and neighbor colony metabolic phenotypes that were present. Surprisingly, we found pervasive effects of neighbor metabolic phenotypes on focal colony growth and reproduction, although the sign and strength of these effects showed strong microenvironmental variability. Overall, we find that the metabolic phenotype changes the strength of competitive interactions, but these effects are highly contingent on local conditions. We suggest future studies explore how variation in metabolic rate affects organisms beyond the focal organism alone, particularly under field conditions.",96b991f5f881b2df26549d9ab2b1486a42ab5083,True,0.9267939925193788

Among the many important roles that habitat plays is as a mediator of ecological interactions, including predator–prey dynamics. In the context of ecosystem restoration, there is great potential to better understand how predator–prey dynamics are influenced by habitat and whether this has implications for how ecosystems are managed. We consider the ways in which habitat serves as an important mediator of interactions between predators and their prey and present four ways in which habitat acts as an intermediary that enhances or diminishes this relationship. We found that habitat provides refuge from predators and shapes the physical traits of prey as they use their surroundings to protect themselves. We also discuss how habitat creates physical resistance and sets the cost of predation for predators and how habitat facilitates apparent competition within a community context. These roles of habitat are well established in ecology, but we believe they are underdeveloped from an applied perspective. We conclude that habitat must be appropriately considered in the context of how it mediates predation. Given the ways that habitat influences predation, restoration efforts should consider if and how physical measures may positively or negatively affect species interactions and whether this could lead to success or failure of overall programs.",a24cbe048fd85dc274ed701906e7687fdce86e28,True,0.989788293838501

When IAS and their parasite(s) invade a guild, the effects of interspecific resource competition and/or parasite-mediated competition can alter existing native host-parasite relationships and the dependent biological traits such as native species' behaviour. We used a natural experiment of populations of native red squirrels Sciurus vulgaris that were colonized by the alien grey squirrel Sciurus carolinensis, comparing repeated measurements of red squirrel parasite infection and personality with those taken in sites where only the native species occurred. We explored two alternative hypotheses: (a) individual differences in personality traits (activity and/or sociability) of native red squirrel positively affect the probability of macroparasite spillover and thus the likelihood to acquire the alien's parasitic helminth Strongyloides robustus; (b) the combined effects of grey squirrel presence and parasite infection result in a reduction of costly personality traits (activity and/or exploration). Using data from 323 arena tests across three experimental (native species and IAS) and three control sites (only native species), we found negative correlations between native species' activity and infection with S. robustus in the sites invaded by the alien species. Activity was also negatively correlated with infection by its native helminth Trypanoxyuris sciuri but only when grey squirrels were present, while in the red-only sites there was no relationship of T. sciuri infection with any of the personality traits. Moreover, individuals that acquired S. robustus during the study reduced their activity after infection, while this was not the case for animals that remained uninfected. Our results show that parasite-mediated competition is costly, reducing activity in individuals of the native species, and altering the native host-native parasite relationships.",a2daa8581a3d839b4ab139c2ccde74f4cfefd47f,True,0.983286678791046

The synchronisation of traits, such as an individual's growth rate, under environmental stress may indicate a loss of phenotypic diversity and thus increased population vulnerability to stochastic deleterious events. In contrast, synchronous growth under favourable ecological conditions and asynchrony during unfavourable conditions may help population resilience and buffer against the negative implications of future environmental variability. Despite the significant implications of growth synchrony and asynchrony to population productivity and persistence, little is known about its causes and consequences either within or among fish populations. This is especially true for long‐lived deep‐sea species that inhabit environments characterised by large‐scale interannual and decadal changes, which could propagate growth synchrony across vast distances. We developed otolith growth chronologies for three deep‐sea fishes (Etelis spp.) over 65° of longitude and 20° of latitude across the Indo‐Pacific region. Using reconstructed time series of interannual growth from six distinct Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), we assessed the level of spatial synchrony at the individual‐, population‐ and species‐scale. Across five decades of data, complex patterns of synchronous and asynchronous growth were apparent for adult populations within and among EEZs of the Pacific Ocean, mediated by shifts in oceanographic phenomena such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Overall, our results indicate that the degree of synchrony in biological traits at depth depends on life history stage, spatiotemporal scales of environmental variability and the influence of ecological factors such as competition and dispersal. By determining the magnitude and timing of spatially synchronous growth at depth and its links to environmental variability, we can better understand fluctuations in deep‐sea productivity and its vulnerability to future environmental stressors, which are key considerations for sustainability.",a2ea6c7720e3d6ee5e0bd33991772d755aeba80b,True,0.9806667566299438
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007423,Species-Specific Traits Rather Than Resource Partitioning Mediate Diversity Effects on Resource Use,"Background The link between biodiversity and ecosystem processes has firmly been established, but the mechanisms underpinning this relationship are poorly documented. Most studies have focused on terrestrial plant systems where resource use can be difficult to quantify as species rely on a limited number of common resources. Investigating resource use at the bulk level may not always be of sufficient resolution to detect subtle differences in resource use, as species-specific nutritional niches at the biochemical level may also moderate diversity effects on resource use. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we use three co-occurring marine benthic echinoderms (Brissopsis lyrifera, Mesothuria intestinalis, Parastichopus tremulus) that feed on the same phytodetrital food source, to determine whether resource partitioning is the principal mechanism underpinning diversity effects on resource use. Specifically we investigate the use of phytodetrital pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) because many of these are essential for biological functions, including reproduction. Pigments were identified and quantified using reverse-phase high performance liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and data were analysed using a combination of extended linear regression with generalised least squares (GLS) estimation and standard multivariate techniques. Our analyses reveal no species-specific selectivity for particular algal pigments, confirming that these three species do not partition food resources at the biochemical level. Nevertheless, we demonstrate increased total resource use in diverse treatments as a result of selection effects and the dominance of one species (B. lyrifera). Conclusion Overall, we found no evidence for resource partitioning at the biochemical level, as pigment composition was similar between individuals, which is likely due to plentiful food availability. Reduced intra-specific competition in the species mixture combined with greater adsorption efficiency and differences in feeding behaviour likely explain the dominant use of resources by B. lyrifera.",a506be3fd23fa2651c954e09b65b9a0acab00c67,True,0.9644992351531982

With their activity diazotrophs support biological production by fixing about 100–200 Tg N/year and turning otherwise unavailable dinitrogen into bioavailable nitrogen (N), an essential limiting nutrient. Despite their important role, the factors that control the distribution of diazotrophs and their ability to fix N2 are not fully elucidated. We discuss insights that can be gained from the emerging picture of a wide geographical distribution of marine diazotrophs and provide a critical assessment of environmental (bottom-up) versus trophic (top-down) controls. We expand a simplified theoretical framework to understand how top-down control affects competition for resources that determine ecological niches. Selective mortality, mediated by grazing or viral-lysis, on non-fixing phytoplankton is identified as a critical process that can broaden the ability of diazotrophs to compete for resources in top-down controlled systems and explain an expanded ecological niche for diazotrophs. Our simplified analysis predicts a larger importance of top-down control on competition patterns as resource levels increase. As grazing controls the faster growing phytoplankton, coexistence of the slower growing diazotrophs can be established. However, these predictions require corroboration by experimental and field data, together with the identification of specific traits of organisms and associated trade-offs related to selective top-down control. Elucidation of these factors could greatly improve our predictive capability for patterns and rates of marine N2 fixation. The susceptibility of this key biogeochemical process to future changes may not only be determined by changes in environmental conditions but also via changes in the ecological interactions.",a596052b50bf8d418112e228dc407db4057eea06,True,0.979987621307373

Freshwater lakes in high‐altitude areas represent a natural system for understanding resource polymorphism in fishes benefiting from diverse lacustrine environments and species‐poor fish assemblages. We report resource polymorphism in a cyprinid fish, Schizopygopsis thermalis, in Lake Amdo Tsonak Co, a headwater lake in the upper Salween River system. Two discrete intraspecific morphs, planktivorous and benthivorous, were identified according to geometric morphometrics and traditional univariate linear measures. The planktivorous morph exhibits a longer head, longer upper and lower jaw, larger asymptotic standard length (L∞), lower growth rate (k), and higher growth performance index (φ) than the benthivorous morph. With respect to descriptive traits, the planktivorous morph possesses a large, terminal mouth and obvious mucus pores on the cheek and chin, while the benthivorous morph is characterized by a more inferior mouth with a sharpen horny edge on the lower jaw and unconspicuous mucus pores.

https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2007.1713,CD4+T cells do not mediate within-host competition between genetically diverse malaria parasites,"Ecological interactions between microparasite populations in the same host are an important source of selection on pathogen traits such as virulence and drug resistance. In the rodent malaria model Plasmodium chabaudi in laboratory mice, parasites that are more virulent can competitively suppress less virulent parasites in mixed infections. There is evidence that some of this suppression is due to immune-mediated apparent competition, where an immune response elicited by one parasite population suppress the population density of another. This raises the question whether enhanced immunity following vaccination would intensify competitive interactions, thus strengthening selection for virulence in Plasmodium populations. Using the P. chabaudi model, we studied mixed infections of virulent and avirulent genotypes in CD4+T cell-depleted mice. Enhanced efficacy of CD4+T cell-dependent responses is the aim of several candidate malaria vaccines. We hypothesized that if immune-mediated interactions were involved in competition, removal of the CD4+T cells would alleviate competitive suppression of the avirulent parasite. Instead, we found no alleviation of competition in the acute phase, and significant enhancement of competitive suppression after parasite densities had peaked. Thus, the host immune response may actually be alleviating other forms of competition, such as that over red blood cells. Our results suggest that the CD4+-dependent immune response, and mechanisms that act to enhance it such as vaccination, may not have the undesirable affect of exacerbating within-host competition and hence the strength of this source of selection for virulence.",b4c6554fae236c260ee8ff8a0c08e0c59d39e649,True,0.993703544139862
https://doi.org/10.3390/ani13071264,Factor in Fear: Interference Competition in Polymorphic Spadefoot Toad Tadpoles and Its Potential Role in Disruptive Selection,"Simple Summary Disruptive selection occurs when extreme phenotypes have a fitness advantage over intermediate phenotypes, thereby favoring the evolution and maintenance of diversity within populations. Resource competition within populations is an important cause of disruptive selection. Individuals can compete in two distinct ways: either by depleting resources (exploitative/indirect competition) or by impeding a competitor’s access to resources (interference/direct competition). However, it is generally assumed that exploitative competition is of greater importance for disruptive selection, while interference competition is rarely considered. Here, we experimentally explored the role of interference competition using a well-known example of disruptive selection, the Mexican spadefoot toad (Spea multiplicata), whose tadpoles develop into alternative resource-use specialists (omnivores and carnivores) while generalist, intermediate tadpoles are disfavored by disruptive selection. Our behavioral experiments revealed that intermediate tadpoles decreased their foraging in the presence of carnivores, while our competition experiment showed that interference competition with carnivores, but not omnivores, significantly lowered growth rates in intermediate tadpoles. Therefore, interference competition may be important in causing disruptive selection. Furthermore, we found that ‘fear’ (phenotypic responses to perceived predation risk) could mediate interference competition as carnivores (who are also cannibalistic) were responsible for both behavioral alterations and a decreased growth rate when direct interaction was possible. Abstract Disruptive selection arises when extreme phenotypes have a fitness advantage compared to more-intermediate phenotypes. Theory and evidence suggest that intraspecific resource competition is a key driver of disruptive selection. However, while competition can be indirect (exploitative) or direct (interference), the role of interference competition in disruptive selection has not been tested, and most models of disruptive selection assume exploitative competition. We experimentally investigated whether the type of competition affects the outcome of competitive interactions using a system where disruptive selection is common: Mexican spadefoot toads (Spea multiplicata). Spea tadpoles develop into alternative resource-use phenotypes: carnivores, which consume fairy shrimp and other tadpoles, and omnivores, which feed on algae and detritus. Tadpoles intermediate in phenotype have low fitness when competition is intense, as they are outcompeted by the specialized tadpoles. Our experiments revealed that the presence of carnivores significantly decreased foraging behavior in intermediate tadpoles, and that intermediate tadpoles had significantly lower growth rates in interference competition treatments with carnivores but not with omnivores. Interference competition may therefore be important in driving disruptive selection. As carnivore tadpoles are also cannibalistic, the ‘fear’ effect may have a greater impact on intermediate tadpoles than exploitative competition alone, similarly to non-consumptive effects in predator–prey or intraguild relationships.",b5ac8daef6d22fbbfe15215579c037fa58f7e5c7,True,0.992308497428894
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.1639,Invasion of a dominant floral resource: effects on the floral community and pollination of native plants.,"Through competition for pollinators, invasive plants may suppress native flora. Community-level studies provide an integrative assessment of invasion impacts and insights into factors that influence the vulnerability of different native species. We investigated effects of the nonnative herb Lythrum salicaria on pollination of native species in 14 fens of the eastern United States. We compared visitors per flower for 122 native plant species in invaded and uninvaded fens and incorporated a landscape-scale experiment, removing L. salicaria flowers from three of the invaded fens. Total flower densities were more than three times higher in invaded than uninvaded or removal sites when L. salicaria was blooming. Despite an increase in number of visitors with number of flowers per area, visitors per native flower declined with increasing numbers of flowers. Therefore, L. salicaria invasion depressed visitation to native flowers. In removal sites, visitation to native flowers was similar to uninvaded sites, confirming the observational results and also suggesting that invasion had not generated a persistent build-up of visitor populations. To study species-level impacts, we examined effects of invasion on visitors per flower for the 36 plant species flowering in both invaded and uninvaded fens. On average, the effect of invasion represented about a 20% reduction in visits per flower. We measured the influence of plant traits on vulnerability to L. salicaria invasion using meta-analysis. Bilaterally symmetrical flowers experienced stronger impacts on visitation, and similarity in flower color to L. salicaria weakly intensified competition with the invader for visitors. Finally, we assessed the reproductive consequences of competition with the invader in a dominant flowering shrub, Dasiphora fruticosa. Despite the negative effect of invasion on pollinator visitation in this species, pollen limitation of seed production was not stronger in invaded than in uninvaded sites, suggesting little impact of competition for pollinators on its population demography. Negative effects on pollination of native plants by this copiously flowering invader appeared to be mediated by increases in total flower density that were not matched by increases in pollinator density. The strength of impact was modulated across native species by their floral traits and reproductive ecology.",b606f7071dc481f60e29a67d8454c3e70e98da0a,True,0.9765100479125975
https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.4145,Not attackable or not crackable—How pre‐ and post‐attack defenses with different competition costs affect prey coexistence and population dynamics,"Abstract It is well‐known that prey species often face trade‐offs between defense against predation and competitiveness, enabling predator‐mediated coexistence. However, we lack an understanding of how the large variety of different defense traits with different competition costs affects coexistence and population dynamics. Our study focusses on two general defense mechanisms, that is, pre‐attack (e.g., camouflage) and post‐attack defenses (e.g., weaponry) that act at different phases of the predator—prey interaction. We consider a food web model with one predator, two prey types and one resource. One prey type is undefended, while the other one is pre‐ or post‐attack defended paying costs either by a higher half‐saturation constant for resource uptake or a lower maximum growth rate. We show that post‐attack defenses promote prey coexistence and stabilize the population dynamics more strongly than pre‐attack defenses by interfering with the predator's functional response: Because the predator spends time handling “noncrackable” prey, the undefended prey is indirectly facilitated. A high half‐saturation constant as defense costs promotes coexistence more and stabilizes the dynamics less than a low maximum growth rate. The former imposes high costs at low resource concentrations but allows for temporally high growth rates at predator‐induced resource peaks preventing the extinction of the defended prey. We evaluate the effects of the different defense mechanisms and costs on coexistence under different enrichment levels in order to vary the importance of bottom‐up and top‐down control of the prey community.",bea47f077d74ff393efb0f398b5af02f31ca75e8,True,0.9188603162765504

However, theory and evidence are beginning to accumulate suggesting that resource competition can drive the evolution of sexual dimorphism, via ecological character displacement between sexes. A key prediction of this hypothesis is that the extent of ecological divergence between sexes will be associated with the extent of sexual dimorphism. As the stable isotope ratios of animal tissues provide a quantitative measure of various aspects of ecology, we carried out a meta‐analysis examining associations between the extent of isotopic divergence between sexes and the extent of body size dimorphism. Our models demonstrate that large amounts of between‐study variation in isotopic (ecological) divergence between sexes is nonrandom and may be associated with the traits of study subjects. We, therefore, completed meta‐regressions to examine whether the extent of isotopic divergence between sexes is associated with the extent of sexual size dimorphism. We found modest but significantly positive associations across species between size dimorphism and ecological differences between sexes, that increased in strength when the ecological opportunity for dietary divergence between sexes was greatest. Our results, therefore, provide further evidence that ecologically mediated selection, not directly related to reproduction, can contribute to the evolution of sexual dimorphism.",bfcedba3b5206806d8309c4b206d4cfa408a0c0c,True,0.9855391383171082
https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aat2456,Bacterial antagonism in host-associated microbial communities,"Interspecies competition shapes communities The gut microbiota of mammals is diverse and dynamic, and gut bacteria respond sensitively to diet and drug intake. Nevertheless, in a healthy adult, microbial community composition remains remarkably stable over time, despite being highly individual. García-Bayona and Comstock review the mechanisms that gut bacterial species use to jostle for space and resources and maintain their populations in the face of intense and varied competition. Bacteria have evolved a range of antibiotics, bacteriocins, toxins, and delivery devices to enable interspecies conflict. These interbacterial weapons possess a spectrum of specificities and range from those that target strains of their own species to broad-acting bacteriocides. This toxic armamentarium provides a valuable resource for potential therapeutic development. Science, this issue p. eaat2456 BACKGROUND Microbial communities are ubiquitous on Earth. The microbiota of different habitats are diverse and have distinct functional traits, but there are common ecological principles that govern their composition. The ability of a microbe to compete with other members of its community for resources is paramount to its success. Competition through the production of molecules that harm other members, known as interference competition, is also important in the assembly and maintenance of microbial communities. As new technologies allow for more in-depth analyses of microbial communities and their genetic content, we are better able to identify new antimicrobial toxins and analyze the effects of their production. Here, we explore the range of antibacterial protein/peptide toxins and toxin-secretion systems, together with the fitness benefits they confer to the producing organisms. Because human-associated microbial communities have been intensely studied over the past decade, our focus is on the growing body of data regarding bacterial antagonism in these and other host-associated microbial communities. ADVANCES Studies continue to reveal the large arsenal of antibacterial peptides and proteins that bacteria produce and the secretion systems that they use to deliver these toxins to competing cells. Bacterially produced antimicrobial peptides and proteins are diverse in terms of their structures, cellular targets, mechanisms of action, and spatial range. Their antagonistic range also varies; some are limited to intraspecies killing, whereas others are able to kill across genera, families, and orders. Through a combination of mathematical modeling and experimental model systems, the ecological outcomes of bacterial antagonism are being elucidated. In vivo analyses in host models have shown that some antimicrobial toxins play a role in microbiota-mediated colonization resistance by preventing invasion of pathogens. Some pathogens, however, also use toxins to battle with the resident microbiota to invade an ecosystem and cause disease. Antagonism has also been shown to facilitate genome evolution; the DNA released from killed cells can be taken up and incorporated into the aggressor’s genome. In some cases, antagonism has been shown to increase rather than reduce microbial diversity, potentially through promotion of spatial segregation of competing strains, facilitating the exchange of signals and secreted products between related cells (kin). The factors that regulate the production and release of some antibacterial toxins are also becoming better understood. Studies are revealing that toxin producers respond to various environmental signals, including signals that indicate host occupancy, that nutrients are limiting, or that they may be attacked by other bacterial community members. OUTLOOK Although bacterial antagonism is an active area of research, we are still in the early stages of understanding the impacts of these interactions in natural community settings and how they influence the overall structure, dynamics, and composition of complex microbial communities. The rapid increase in the number of available metagenomic datasets derived from diverse microbial communities and the expanding capability to culture and genetically modify these organisms is allowing for the identification and characterization of new . The protective function of microbiota-produced toxins in warding off pathogens indicates a potential for applications in medical, agricultural, and other industrial settings. In addition, the inclusion of antibacterial toxins in genetically engineered bacteria (live biotherapeutics) may allow for specific targeting of harmful community members, including those involved in therapeutic failures, and may also allow a live biotherapeutic to compete with members of the microbiota to deliver various health-promoting functions. Intra- and interspecies antagonism—the example of Bacteroides species in the human gut. Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides uniformis use MACPF (membrane attack complex/perforin) toxins—BSAP-1 and BSAP-2, respectively—for intraspecies killing. Producer strains carry a modified receptor [outer membrane protein (OMP) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) glycan] that confers resistance to its cognate toxin. B. fragilis can also kill other B. fragilis strains and most gut Bacteroidales species via type VI secretion systems (T6SSs). Antagonistic interactions are abundant in microbial communities and contribute not only to the composition and relative proportions of their members but also to the longer-term stability of a community. This Review will largely focus on bacterial antagonism mediated by ribosomally synthesized peptides and proteins produced by members of host-associated microbial communities. We discuss recent findings on their diversity, functions, and ecological impacts. These systems play key roles in ecosystem defense, pathogen invasion, spatial segregation, and diversity but also confer indirect gains to the aggressor from products released by killed cells. Investigations into antagonistic bacterial interactions are important for our understanding of how the microbiota establish within hosts, influence health and disease, and offer insights into potential translational applications.",c64661161b43f837cfa9d61c10c9e8cbfcd5495a,True,0.9835407733917236

Beyond describing grassland community patterns along gradients in P availability, it remains unclear how individual species with different strategies respond to increasing phosphorus. Here we studied intraspecific variability of leaf functional traits in response to soil phosphorus, for species with contrasting resource‐use strategies.We set up a pot experiment with communities containing four species, assembled from a pool of 20 mesotrophic grassland species growing along a soil P gradient. Species selection included various growth forms (grasses vs forbs) and resource‐use strategies (acquisitive vs conservative resource use). We measured three variables characterizing the (a)biotic environmental context: bioavailable soil P concentration, total community biomass as a proxy for the intensity of competition, and the proportional biomass of a species in the community as a proxy for its competitive dominance. We investigated the effect of this environmental context on the expression of two leaf traits, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC).We found an acquisitive trait expression within species (increase in SLA and decrease in LDMC) in response to increased soil P supply and a conservative trait expression (decrease in SLA and increase in LDMC) in response to an increase in total community biomass. Importantly, the trait responses to the environmental context were generally consistent for species representing very different resource‐use strategies and growth forms.Species responded with a shift from an acquisitive to a conservative trait expression in response to limited resources; i.e., driven by a decrease in soil phosphorus concentration or an increase in total community biomass. Unexpectedly, the intraspecific variability in response to the changing environmental conditions was not clearly mediated by the species’ strategy. These findings show that plant ecological strategies are probably not the main driver for intraspecific trait variability in an experimental grassland community.",d8e3c0d5c7ba1d8dbdc4cb2115efe8911b506679,True,0.984880805015564

However, empirical evidence for this trade-off is mixed, raising questions about the extent to which it shapes diverse ecological communities. Here we outline a framework that can be used to improve empirical tests of the competition-colonization trade-off. We argue that tests of the competition-colonization trade-off have been diverted into unproductive paths when dispersal mode and/or competition type have been inadequately defined. To generate comparative predictions of associations between dispersal and competitive performance, we develop a conceptual trait-based framework that clarifies how dispersal mode and type of competitor shape this trade-off at the stage of dispersal and establishment in a variety of systems. Our framework suggests that competition-colonization trade-offs may be less common for passively dispersing organisms when competitive dominants are those best able to withstand resource depletion (competitive response), and for active dispersers when traits for dispersal performance are positively associated with resource pre-emption (competitive effect). The framework presented here is designed to provide common ground for researchers working in different systems in order to prompt more effective assessment of this performance trade-off and its role in shaping community structure. By delineating key system properties that mediate the trade-off between competitive and colonization performance and their relationship to individual-level traits, researchers in disparate systems can structure their predictions about this trade-off more effectively and compare across systems more clearly.",df3f179616fd405d7dd7f7758bec040eb7c1e49d,True,0.9818688035011292

Here, we offer an alternative framework where virulent immune-provoking behaviours and enhanced immune resistance are joint tactics of invading pathogens to eliminate resident competitors (transferring resources from resident to invading pathogen). The pathogen wins by creating a novel immunological challenge to which it is already adapted. We analyse a general ecological model of ‘proactive invasion’ where invaders not adapted to a local environment can succeed by changing it to one where they are better adapted than residents. However, the two-trait nature of the ‘proactive’ strategy (provocation of, and adaptation to environmental change) presents an evolutionary conundrum, as neither trait alone is favoured in a homogenous host population.

https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2904,Disturbance size and frequency mediate the coexistence of benthic spatial competitors.,"Disturbance plays a key role in structuring community dynamics and is central to conservation and natural resource management. However, ecologists continue to debate the importance of disturbance for species coexistence and biodiversity. Such disagreements may arise in part because few studies have examined variation across multiple dimensions of disturbance (e.g., size, frequency) and how the effects of disturbance may depend on species attributes (e.g., competitiveness, dispersal ability). In light of this gap in understanding and accelerating changes to disturbance regimes worldwide, we used spatial population models to explore how disturbance size and frequency interact with species attributes to affect coexistence between seagrass (Zostera marina) and colonial burrowing shrimp (Neotrypaea californiensis) that compete for benthic space in estuaries throughout the west coast of North America. By simulating population dynamics under a range of ecologically-relevant disturbance regimes, we discovered that intermediate disturbance (approximately 9-23% of landscape area per year) to short-dispersing, competitively-dominant seagrass can foster long-term stable coexistence with broad-dispersing, competitively-inferior burrowing shrimp via the spatial storage effect. When holding the total extent of disturbance constant, the individual size and annual frequency of disturbance altered landscape spatial patterns and mediated the dominance and evenness of competitors. Many small disturbances favored short-dispersing seagrass by hastening recolonization, whereas fewer large disturbances benefitted rapidly-colonizing burrowing shrimp by creating temporary refugia from competition. As a result, large, infrequent disturbances generally improved the strength and stability of coexistence relative to small, frequent disturbances. Regardless of disturbance size or frequency, the dispersal ability of the superior competitor (seagrass), the competitive ability the inferior competitor (burrowing shrimp), and the reproduction and survival of both species strongly influenced population abundances and coexistence. Our results show that disturbance size and frequency can promote or constrain coexistence by altering the duration of time over which inferior competitors can escape competitive exclusion, particularly when colonization depends on the spatial pattern of disturbance due to dispersal traits. For coastal managers and conservation practitioners, our findings indicate that reducing particularly large disturbances may help conserve globally-imperiled seagrass meadows and control burrowing shrimp colonies that can threaten the viability of oyster aquaculture.",e7d0fd3c13b253fd4ccede50698faf6505e2505a,True,0.986461877822876
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13028,Host traits and competitive ability jointly structure disease dynamics and community assembly.,"Parasitism and competition are both ubiquitous interactions in ecological communities. The ability of host species to interact directly via competition and indirectly through shared parasites suggests that host traits related to competition and parasitism are likely important in structuring communities and disease dynamics. Specifically, those host traits affecting competition and those mediating parasitism are often correlated either because of trade-offs (in resource acquisition or resource allocation) or condition dependence, yet the consequences of these trait relationships for community and epidemiological dynamics are poorly understood. We conducted a literature review of parasite-related host traits-competitive ability relationships. We found that transmission-competitive ability relationships were most often reported, and that superior competitors exhibited elevated transmission relative to their less-competitive counterparts in nearly 80% of the cases. We also found a significant number of virulence-competitive ability and parasite shedding-competitive ability relationships. We investigated these links by altering the relationship between host competitive ability and three parasite-related traits (transmission, virulence and parasite shedding rates) in a simple model, incorporating competitive asymmetries in a multi-host community. We show that these relationships can lead to a range of different communities. For example, depending on the strength and direction of these distinct trait relationships, we observed communities with anywhere from high parasite prevalence to complete parasite extinction, and either one, two or the maximum of three host species coexisting. Our results suggest that parasite-competitive ability relationships may be common in nature, that further integration of these relationships can produce novel and unexpected community and disease dynamics, and that generalizations may allow for the prediction of how parasitism and competition jointly structure disease and diversity in natural communities.",f0df51d9c947b2b8f3e6a5884bcf8c83ab27ce61,True,0.9857083559036256
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.70039,Coexistence of coinvading species with mutualism and competition,"Abstract All interactions between multiple species invading together (coinvasion) must be accounted for to predict species coexistence patterns across space. Mutualisms, particularly, are known to influence species' population dynamics and their invasive ability (e.g., mycorrhizal fungi with partner plants). Yet, while modeling coinvasion, their role in mediating coexistence is overlooked. Here, we build a spatially explicit model of coinvasion of two competing plant species with a shared fungal mutualist to study how mutualism and competition interact to shape the local and regional coexistence of competitors. We observe four main results. First, mutualist presence generates regional coexistence between competitors even when local coexistence between them is impossible. Second, increasing partner mutualist dispersal leads to abrupt changes in competitor coexistence outcomes. Third, differences in mutualist partner dependence and competitive ability interact to produce a variety of local and regional coexistence outcomes. Fourth, asymmetry in the dispersal ability arising from dependence‐dispersal trade‐offs leads to greater exclusion of species less dependent on mutualist partners for growth. In toto, incorporating mutualism‐specific trait trade‐offs and dispersal asymmetries into coinvasion models offers new insights into regional coexistence and invasive species distributions.",f14b0dd3d54eded3b876083986fa574080bdb6e9,True,0.9372382760047911
10.1038/s41467-022-30469-3,Dynamic character displacement among a pair of bacterial phyllosphere commensals in situ,"Differences between species promote stable coexistence in a resource-limited environment. These differences can result from interspecies competition leading to character shifts, a process referred to as character displacement. While character displacement is often interpreted as a consequence of genetically fixed trait differences between species, it can also be mediated by phenotypic plasticity in response to the presence of another species. Here, we test whether phenotypic plasticity leads to a shift in proteome allocation during co-occurrence of two bacterial species from the abundant, leaf-colonizing families Sphingomonadaceae and Rhizobiaceae in their natural habitat. Upon mono-colonizing of the phyllosphere, both species exhibit specific and shared protein functions indicating a niche overlap. During co-colonization, quantitative differences in the protein repertoire of both bacterial populations occur as a result of bacterial coexistence in planta. Specifically, the Sphingomonas strain produces enzymes for the metabolization of xylan, while the Rhizobium strain reprograms its metabolism to beta-oxidation of fatty acids fueled via the glyoxylate cycle and adapts its biotin acquisition. We demonstrate the conditional relevance of cross-species facilitation by mutagenesis leading to loss of fitness in competition in planta. Our results show that dynamic character displacement and niche facilitation mediated by phenotypic plasticity can contribute to species coexistence. In this study, the concept of dynamic character displacement among interacting bacterial species from leaf-colonizing families was empirically tested using a proteomics approach. A phenotypic shift towards the utilization of alternative carbon sources was observed during coexistence, thereby minimizing niche overlap.",0250d8de5a0511b8e5f8f4625211ed02b4a6fbdc,,

We tested the role of behaviour in resource use divergence of two Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) phenotypes, a slim, putatively pelagic-dwelling morph and a robust, putatively littoral-dwelling generalist morph, over an annual cycle, using biotelemetry and stable isotopes. Pelagic morph charr exhibited significantly greater δC13 depletion, concordant with increased zooplanktivory, than for the Littoral morph. Although three-dimensional space-use of the morphs strongly overlapped, on average, the Littoral morph used that habitat 19.3% more than the Pelagic morph. Pelagic morph fish were significantly more active, further from the lake bed and at greater depth than Littoral fish (annual means respectively, Pelagic, 0.069BLs−1, 8.21 m and 14.11 m; Littoral, 0.047BLs−1, 5.87 m and 10.47 m). Patterns of habitat use differed between ecomorphs at key times, such as during autumn and at ice break, likely related to spawning and resumption of intensive foraging respectively. Extensive space-use overlap, but fine-scale differences in habitat use between charr ecomorphs, suggests the importance of competition for generating and maintaining polymorphism, and its potential for promoting reproductive isolation and evolution in sympatry.",04aea2d671ba70122f0c2e0dde8c95e54b84608a,,

This study aimed to elucidate how seed traits influence infestation dynamics and species interactions, focusing on acorn weevils infesting Quercus mongolica. Species identification and clarification of their evolutionary relationships within the Curculio genus were performed through phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene sequences. The seed infestation patterns were assessed by comparing the infestation rates across various seed size classes. Furthermore, the correlations between the seed morphological traits (length, width, aspect ratio, and weight) and weevil abundance were analyzed. The phylogenetic results revealed well-supported monophyletic clades corresponding to Curculio arakawai and Curculio sikkimensis. This confirmed the clear genetic separation between these two distinct weevil species, thereby substantiating the divergence observed in weevil populations correlated with different seed hosts. The infestation patterns revealed the association of weevil species-specific preferences with seed size: C. arakawai predominantly infested larger acorn seeds, whereas C. sikkimensis predominantly infested smaller acorn seeds. C. sikkimensis favored smaller ones. Both species exhibited positive correlations between abundance and seed length and width in larger seeds; however, the seed weight displayed no significant effect. These results indicate niche differentiation mediated by seed size and morphology, which likely reduced interspecific competition and facilitated coexistence. This study elucidates species-specific host selection patterns in acorn weevils and highlights acorn traits as crucial factors shaping seed predator assemblages. The findings provide valuable insights for developing targeted pest management strategies and supporting sustainable oak forest regeneration.",07808f9ca2a186d5d649471839944b8f2ca81202,,
10.1098/rspb.2022.1838,Biotic interactions shape trait assembly of marine communities across time and latitude,"Assembly processes are highly dynamic with biotic filters operating more intensely at local scales, yet the strength of biotic interactions can vary across time and latitude. Predation, for example, can be stronger at lower latitudes, while competition can intensify at later stages of assembly due to resource limitation. Since biotic filters act upon functional traits of organisms, we explored trait-mediated community assembly in diverse marine assemblages from four regions along the Pacific coast of North and Central America. Using predator exclusion experiments and two assembly stages, we tested the hypotheses that non-random trait patterns would emerge during late assembly at all regions due to competition and at lower latitude regions regardless of assembly stage due to predation. As expected, trait divergence occurred in late assembly but only at higher latitude regions, while in tropical Panama, relaxed predation caused trait divergence during late assembly. Moreover, colonizing trait strategies were common during early assembly while competitive strategies were favoured during late assembly at higher latitude regions. Predation-resistant traits were only favoured in Panama during both assembly stages. Our large-scale manipulative study demonstrates that different biotic interactions across time and latitude can have important consequences for trait assembly.",0b1b88cdf20ca66859eec1b9d8f8b08138980548,,
10.1242/jeb.224824,Conspecific chemical cues drive density-dependent metabolic suppression independently of resource intake,"ABSTRACT Within species, individuals of the same size can vary substantially in their metabolic rate. One source of variation in metabolism is conspecific density – individuals in denser populations may have lower metabolism than those in sparser populations. However, the mechanisms through which conspecifics drive metabolic suppression remain unclear. Although food competition is a potential driver, other density-mediated factors could act independently or in combination to drive metabolic suppression, but these drivers have rarely been investigated. We used sessile marine invertebrates to test how food availability interacts with oxygen availability, water flow and chemical cues to affect metabolism. We show that conspecific chemical cues induce metabolic suppression independently of food and this metabolic reduction is associated with the downregulation of physiological processes rather than feeding activity. Conspecific cues should be considered when predicting metabolic variation and competitive outcomes as they are an important, but underexplored, source of variation in metabolic traits. Summary: Conspecific chemical cues induce metabolic suppression independently of food, and this metabolic reduction is associated with the downregulation of physiological processes rather than feeding activity.",0c5dd6ad9fe6509c596895205ae2a66e9a3c5a5d,,
10.1371/journal.pone.0029487,Selection against Accumulating Mutations in Niche-Preference Genes Can Drive Speciation,"Our current understanding of sympatric speciation is that it occurs primarily through disruptive selection on ecological genes driven by competition, followed by reproductive isolation through reinforcement-like selection against inferior intermediates/heterozygotes. Our evolutionary model of selection on resource recognition and preference traits suggests a new mechanism for sympatric speciation. We find speciation can occur in three phases. First a polymorphism of functionally different phenotypes is established through evolution of specialization. On the gene level, regulatory functions have evolved in which some alleles are conditionally switched off (i.e. are silent). These alleles accumulate harmful mutations that potentially may be expressed in offspring through recombination. Second mating associated with resource preference invades because harmful mutations in parents are not expressed in the offspring when mating assortatively, thereby dividing the population into two pre-zygotically isolated resource-specialist lineages. Third, silent alleles that evolved in phase one now accumulate deleterious mutations over the following generations in a Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller fashion, establishing a post-zygotic barrier to hybridization.",0e25a18b01af535f7a0fb2621719700201751362,,
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013245,Evolution of foraging behaviour induces variable complexity-stability relationships in mutualist-exploiter-predator communities,"Early ecological theory predicts that complex ecological networks are unstable and are unlikely to persist, despite many empirical studies of such complexity in nature. This inconsistency has fascinated ecologists for decades. To resolve the complexity-stability debate, coupling population dynamics and trait dynamics is considered to be an important way to understand the long-term stability of ecological community assemblages. However, we still do not know how eco-evolutionary feedbacks affect the relationship between complexity and stability in ecologically realistic networks with both antagonistic and mutualistic interactions. Here, we explored an adaptive network model to evaluate how the evolution of foraging preference to determine the relationship between network complexity (i.e., connectance) and stability (i.e., community persistence at steady state) in mutualist-exploiter-predator communities (MEST). Our theoretical results showed: (i) adaptive foraging of the top predator contributes to the stability of mutualism and intermediate intensity of foraging adaptations can lead to chaotic dynamics in a four-species MEST community; (ii) the complexity-stability relationship may show positive monotonic, negative monotonic, peaked and double-peaked patterns in general MEST communities, while the double-peaked pattern is only obtained when both the adaptation intensity and interspecific competition are high. Furthermore, model predictions may be consistent with both the negative monotonic pattern revealed in freshwater communities and the peaked pattern revealed in marine communities. Finally, we infer that foraging adaptations of the top predator may alter positive or/and negative feedback loops (trait-mediated indirect effects) to affect the stability of general MEST communities. Our adaptive network framework may provide an effective way to address the complexity-stability debate in real ecosystems.",0e76d546d355fe15e230cae355a0ac49bc386933,,
10.1073/pnas.2103162118,Growth–defense trade-offs shape population genetic composition in an iconic forest tree species,"Significance Genetic diversity is critical for ecological resilience and is maintained when different traits are advantageous in different environments. Traits are not entirely independent, however: When trade-offs occur, selection on one trait may indirectly act on another. Here we examine how environmentally mediated selection for growth interacts with a trade-off between growth and herbivore defense in experimental aspen stands. We show that even an environmentally fixed trait trade-off can lead to real-time divergence in population genetic composition between environments. The underlying growth–defense trade-off led to an eco-evolutionary dynamic wherein high-competition environments selected for fast-growing trees and thus ultimately selected against herbivore resistance. This discovery reveals how patterns of genetic covariation, coupled with environmental variation, can link ecological and evolutionary processes. All organisms experience fundamental conflicts between divergent metabolic processes. In plants, a pivotal conflict occurs between allocation to growth, which accelerates resource acquisition, and to defense, which protects existing tissue against herbivory. Trade-offs between growth and defense traits are not universally observed, and a central prediction of plant evolutionary ecology is that context-dependence of these trade-offs contributes to the maintenance of intraspecific variation in defense [Züst and Agrawal, Annu. Rev. Plant Biol., 68, 513–534 (2017)]. This prediction has rarely been tested, however, and the evolutionary consequences of growth–defense trade-offs in different environments are poorly understood, especially in long-lived species [Cipollini et al., Annual Plant Reviews (Wiley, 2014), pp. 263–307]. Here we show that intraspecific trait trade-offs, even when fixed across divergent environments, interact with competition to drive natural selection of tree genotypes corresponding to their growth–defense phenotypes. Our results show that a functional trait trade-off, when coupled with environmental variation, causes real-time divergence in the genetic architecture of tree populations in an experimental setting. Specifically, competitive selection for faster growth resulted in dominance by fast-growing tree genotypes that were poorly defended against natural enemies. This outcome is a signature example of eco-evolutionary dynamics: Competitive interactions affected microevolutionary trajectories on a timescale relevant to subsequent ecological interactions [Brunner et al., Funct. Ecol. 33, 7–12 (2019)]. Eco-evolutionary drivers of tree growth and defense are thus critical to stand-level trait variation, which structures communities and ecosystems over expansive spatiotemporal scales.",14c9352609fd2cfb8e78eddf51613281890ad75b,,
10.1371/journal.pbio.2003563,Contrasting impacts of competition on ecological and social trait evolution in songbirds,"Competition between closely related species has long been viewed as a powerful selective force that drives trait diversification, thereby generating phenotypic diversity over macroevolutionary timescales. However, although the impact of interspecific competition has been documented in a handful of iconic insular radiations, most previous studies have focused on traits involved in resource use, and few have examined the role of competition across large, continental radiations. Thus, the extent to which broad-scale patterns of phenotypic diversity are shaped by competition remain largely unclear, particularly for social traits. Here, we estimate the effect of competition between interacting lineages by applying new phylogenetic models that account for such interactions to an exceptionally complete dataset of resource-use traits and social signaling traits for the entire radiation of tanagers (Aves, Thraupidae), the largest family of songbirds. We find that interspecific competition strongly influences the evolution of traits involved in resource use, with a weaker effect on plumage signals, and very little effect on song. Our results provide compelling evidence that interspecific exploitative competition contributes to ecological trait diversification among coexisting species, even in a large continental radiation. In comparison, signal traits mediating mate choice and social competition seem to diversify under different evolutionary models, including rapid diversification in the allopatric stage of speciation.",15ab0c31c232d716ffe48f6a25eac008e2bbe64c,,
10.1002/ece3.71466,Effect of Resource Abundance on Woodland Rodents' Demography at Latitudinal Extremes in Europe,"ABSTRACT Climate change effects on primary productivity are especially evident along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. Some of the species with a fast reproductive cycle strategy and relying on primary productivity may rapidly respond to such changes with alterations to demographic parameters. However, how these bottom‐up effects may emerge in systems with different population dynamics has not been elucidated. We aimed to assess the role of food availability on rodent demography in populations characterised by different dynamics, that is multiannual cycles in Northern European populations and mast‐driven outbreaks in Southern European populations, both driven by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We live‐trapped woodland rodents at these latitudinal extremes in two study systems (Norway, Italy) while deploying control/treatment designs of food manipulation providing ad libitum trophic resource availability, albeit not reflecting the natural resource fluctuations. We applied a multistate open robust design model to estimate population patterns and survival rates while controlling for seasonal variation, intrinsic traits, and co‐occurrence of sympatric species. Yellow‐necked and wood mouse (Apodemus spp.) were sympatric with bank vole ( Clethrionomys glareolus ) in Italy, while only the latter was trapped in Norway. Food provisioning increased both survival and population size of bank vole in Norway, where temperatures are harsher and snow cover persists in winter. In milder Italian habitats, the wood mouse abundance was boosted by food availability, increasing also survival rates (but only in females), whereas the bank vole showed a decrease in both parameters across sexes. We speculate that overabundant food resources may trigger some forms of competition between sympatric wood mouse and bank vole, although other types of interactions, such as predation and parasitism, may also contribute. By manipulating food availability in two systems where rodents have different population dynamics, we showed how resource availability exerted bottom‐up effects on rodent demography, especially in the context of climate change, although being mediated by other intrinsic and extrinsic factors.",1639ff2351a63e233b9d163e7c2cadf5c1d82cbf,,

We investigated the effects of competition regime on the uptake of different N forms by two hygrophytes, Carex thunbergii and Polygonum criopolitanum, by conducting a hydroponic test of excised roots and an in situ experiment in a subtropical wetland ecosystem. The two species were grown either in monocultures or mixtures with various neighbor densities. Root functional traits and N uptake rates of different N forms were measured. Our results showed that N uptake was mainly determined by N form, rather than species identity. Both species were able to use organic N sources, but they took up relatively more N supplied as NO3- than as NH4+ or glycine, irrespective of competition treatments. Both species preferred NO3- when grown in monoculture, but in the presence of competitors, the preference of fast-growing C. thunbergii persisted while P. criopolitanum acquired more NH4+ and glycine, with stronger responses being observed at the highest neighbor density. The hydroponic test suggested that these divergences in N acquisition between two species might be partially explained by different root functional traits. To be specific, N uptake rates were significantly positively correlated with root N concentration and specific root length, but negatively correlated with root dry matter content. Our results implicated that C. thunbergii has a competitive advantage with relatively more stable N acquisition strategy despite a lower N recovery than P. criopolitanum, whereas P. criopolitanum could avoid competition with C. thunbergii via a better access to organic N sources, partly mediated by competition regimes.",1ca37a2a3ff3da1199d17847f1bca294d50c90e1,,

To guide effective conservation policies, it is essential to understand the relationship between species diversity and carbon storage in this unique ecosystem. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the response of aboveground carbon (AGC) to species and functional diversity and their effects on AGC in the Yayu Coffee Forest Biosphere Reserve (YCFBR). Using different plot sizes, we collected vegetation data from the core, buffer, and transitional zones of the reserve. We selected traits related to plant‐life strategy, competition ability, response to disturbances, and climate change. Structural equation models (SEMs) were employed to assess the effects of species diversity, functional diversity, and functional dominance on AGC. Data analysis was conducted using R software. Our results revealed that the effects of species richness on AGC were mediated through functional diversity and functional dominance, as demonstrated by both the full mediation and partial mediation models. This suggests that the selection effects and niche complementarity are mutually exclusive yet equally important for predicting AGC. The findings further indicate that functional diversity and functional dominance together accounted for significant predictors of the AGC by 21% in the YCFBR. From a practical standpoint, findings highlight the importance of conserving species diversity as a means to maintain higher AGC in the tropical moist Afromontane forests. In conclusion, this research significantly contributes to the scientific literature by providing valuable insights into the complex relationship between species diversity and carbon storage. The results emphasize the crucial role of functional diversity and dominance in predicting AGC, underscoring the importance of biodiversity conservation for climate mitigation efforts. These findings have practical implications for the development of effective conservation policies tailored to protect and sustain the carbon storage potential of this unique ecosystem.",22abec31a313ba9e3afc571f6bab5b8c1ec882c8,,
10.1111/eva.13746,Competitive interactions affect introgression and population viability amidst maladaptive hybridization,"The deliberate release of captive‐bred individuals, the accidental escape of domesticated strains, or the invasion of closely related conspecifics into wild populations can all lead to introgressive hybridization, which poses a challenge for conservation and wildlife management. Rates of introgression and the magnitude of associated demographic impacts vary widely across ecological contexts. However, the reasons for this variation remain poorly understood. One rarely considered phenomenon in this context is soft selection, wherein relative trait values determine success in intraspecific competition for a limiting resource. Here we develop an eco‐genetic model explicitly focussed on understanding the influence of such competitive interactions on the eco‐evolutionary dynamics of wild populations experiencing an influx of foreign/domesticated individuals. The model is applicable to any taxon that experiences natural or human‐mediated inputs of locally maladapted genotypes (‘intrusion’), in addition to phenotype‐dependent competition for a limiting resource (e.g. breeding sites, feeding territories). The effects of both acute and chronic intrusion depended strongly on the relative competitiveness of intruders versus locals. When intruders were competitively inferior, density‐dependent regulation limited their reproductive success (ability to compete for limited spawning sites), which prevented strong introgression or population declines from occurring. In contrast, when intruders were competitively superior, this amplified introgression and led to increased maladaptation of the admixed population. This had negative consequences for population size and population viability. The results were sensitive to the intrusion level, the magnitude of reproductive excess, trait heritability and the extent to which intruders were maladapted relative to locals. Our findings draw attention to under‐appreciated interactions between phenotype‐dependent competitive interactions and maladaptive hybridization, which may be critical to determining the impact captive breeding programmes and domesticated escapees can have on otherwise self‐sustaining wild populations.",26d2ebe06be830fb622c83a09b21bef76271feae,,
10.1002/ecs2.4950,Competition between mixo‐ and heterotrophic ciliates under dynamic resource supply,"The outcome of species competition strongly depends on the traits of the competitors and associated trade‐offs, as well as on environmental variability. Here, we investigate the relevance of consumer trait variation for species coexistence in a ciliate consumer–microalgal prey system under fluctuating regimes of resource supply. We focus on consumer competition and feeding traits, and specifically on the consumer's ability to overcome periods of resource limitation by mixotrophy, that is, the ability of photosynthetic carbon fixation via algal symbionts in addition to phagotrophy. In a 48‐day chemostat experiment, we investigated competitive interactions of different heterotrophic and mixotrophic ciliates of the genera Euplotes and Coleps under different resource regimes, providing prey either continuously or in pulses under constant or fluctuating light, entailing periods of resource depletion in fluctuating environments, but overall providing the same amount of prey and light. Although ultimate competition results remained unaffected, population dynamics of mixotrophic and heterotrophic ciliates were significantly altered by resource supply mode. However, the effects differed among species combinations and changed over time. Whether mixotrophs or heterotrophs dominated in competition strongly depended on the genera of the competing species and thus, species‐specific differences in the minimum resource requirements that are associated with feeding on shared prey, nutrient uptake, light harvesting, and access to additional resources such as bacteria. Potential differences in the curvature of the species' resource‐dependent growth functions may have further mediated the species‐specific responses to the different resource supply modes. Overall, our study demonstrates that genus‐ or species‐specific traits other than that related to nutritional mode may override the relevance of acquired phototrophy by heterotrophs in competitive interactions, and that the potential advantage of photosynthetic carbon fixation of symbiont‐bearing mixotrophs in competition with pure heterotrophs may differ greatly among different mixotrophs, playing out under different environmental conditions and depending on the specific requirements of the species. Complex trophic interactions determine the outcome of competition, which can only be understood by taking on a multidimensional trait perspective.",283cf8989c67d0c0c4e81a1f19e954fe939f24af,,

Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) inhabiting stream reaches with different predation regimes have rapidly evolved divergent life history traits. Here, we investigated the effects of both predation and resource availability on guppy trophic niches by evaluating their gut contents, resource standing stocks, and δ15N and δ13C stable isotopes across five streams during the wet season. We found that guppies from low predation (LP) sites had a consistently higher trophic position and proportion of invertebrates in their guts and assimilate less epilithon than guppies from high predation (HP) sites. Higher trophic position was also associated with lower benthic invertebrate availability. Our results suggest that LP guppies could be more efficient invertebrate consumers, possibly as an evolutionary response to greater intraspecific competition for higher quality food. This may be intensified by seasonality, as wet season conditions can alter resource availability, feeding rates, and the intensity of intraspecific competition. Understanding how guppy diets vary among communities is critical to elucidating the role of niche shifts in mediating the link between environmental change and the evolution of life histories.",2b6e7fade1df25e10afca55a0fc82a25c957d0db,,

Higher-order ecological effects beyond pairwise interactions may be key to complex ecosystems, but mechanisms to produce these effects remain poorly understood. Here we model microbial growth and competition to show that higher-order effects can arise from variation in multiple microbial growth traits, such as lag times and growth rates, on a single limiting resource with no other interactions. These effects produce a range of ecological phenomena: an unlimited number of strains can exhibit multistability and neutral coexistence, potentially with a single keystone strain; strains that coexist in pairs do not coexist all together; and a strain that wins all pairwise competitions can go extinct in a mixed competition. Since variation in multiple growth traits is ubiquitous in microbial populations, our results indicate these higher-order effects may also be widespread, especially in laboratory ecology and evolution experiments.Higher-order interactions occur when one species mediates the interaction between two others. Here, the authors model microbial growth and competition to show that higher-order interactions can arise from tradeoffs in growth traits, leading to neutral coexistence and other complex dynamics.",2c00165cc717678ca3cfa47016791380206e1a60,,

Understanding the environmental context and species traits that give rise to these divergent outcomes is a major challenge to the generality of both theoretical and applied ecology. In aquatic systems, nutrient-mediated eutrophication has led to major declines in species diversity, motivating us to seek terrestrial analogues using a large-mammal system across 598 000 km2 of the Canadian boreal forest. These forests are undergoing some of the most rapid rates of land-use change on Earth and are home to declining caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations. Using satellite-derived estimates of primary productivity, coupled with estimates of moose (Alces alces) and wolf (Canis lupus) abundance, we used path analyses to discriminate among hypotheses explaining how habitat alteration can affect caribou population growth. Hypotheses included food limitation, resource dominance by moose over caribou, and apparent competition with predators shared between moose and caribou. Results support apparent competition and yield estimates of wolf densities (1.8 individuals 1000 km−2) above which caribou populations decline. Our multi-trophic analysis provides insight into the cascading effects of habitat alteration from forest cutting that destabilize terrestrial predator–prey dynamics. Finally, the path analysis highlights why conservation actions directed at the proximate cause of caribou decline have been more successful in the near term than those directed further along the trophic chain.",2eb292d5549e1aa6b1a5d59e71a8d5fda358326a,,
10.3390/d17020108,Ecological Traits and Intraguild Competition Mediate Spatial and Temporal Overlaps Among Sympatric Mesocarnivores,"In terrestrial mammalian carnivore guilds, interspecific competitions (interferences and resource competitions) among sympatric species induce their ecological and behavioral patterns and population dynamics, thereby shaping community structures. Competitive species must partition their ecological niches for sympatry, while the extent of niche overlaps is mediated by either the ecological traits (e.g., body size differences) or environmental features. We aimed to elucidate the patterns of spatial and temporal niche overlaps in mesocarnivore guilds, which are mediated by their ecological traits, regional environments, and anthropogenic disturbances. We investigated the spatial occurrence and diel activities of six mesocarnivore species and estimated their spatial and temporal overlap indices in various landscapes with different anthropogenic disturbances in central Bulgaria. Statistical modeling demonstrated that spatial overlap among mesocarnivores declined when mesocarnivore pairs were within the same family and when large carnivores (particularly wolves, Canis lupus) were present. Furthermore, we found that the extent of their temporal overlaps was associated with taxonomic and body size differences in mesocarnivore pairs as well as their trophic competitions. Our findings indicated that the intensity of interferences among mesocarnivore species was key for the decline of spatial or temporal niche overlap to relax antagonistic interactions.",3003361b35e6ec7695f569a88a2848e7f2de1a17,,
10.1086/408437,"The Comparative Evolutionary Biology of the Sibling Species, Drosophila melanogaster and D. Simulans","1. D. melanogaster and D. simulans are sibling species; they are morphologically almost identical and genetically very similar. Whereas their sexual behavior patterns are qualitatively similar, hybrids are rarely produced and when they are, they are sterile. 2. Although not all data are in agreement, D. melanogaster generally exhibits more chromosomal, enzyme, and protein polymorphism than does D. simulans. Utilizin this relationship, as well as arguments presented in the literature, one can argue for an association between genetic variability and level of ecological heterogeneity. This association is found for two major environmental variables, temperature and light dependence. 3. On a seasonal basis, D. melanogaster achieves large population numbers early in the summer, as D. simulans does in the autumn. The ratio of D. melanogaster to D. simulans increases with temperature and more importantly, with temperature fluctuation. Macroenvironmental temperature is an important factor involved in numerical changes within the two species. Both species from Brisbane, Queensland, are genetically heterogeneous for resistance to desiccation, with additive genetic effects and directional dominance for resistance, whereas at Melbourne, Victoria, D. melanogaster is similar, but the genetic architecture of D. simulans is additive only. Desiccation resistance in the D. simulans Melbourne population varies cyclically on an annual basis but not in the other populations-apparently different genotypes are selected differentially at different times of the year. Between-species generalizations, as in (2) above, are therefore made difficult because of variations within species. 4. From collections at a vineyard and maturation wine cellar coupled with subsequent laboratory experiments, it is clear that an environment in which D. melanogaster occurs exclusive of D. simulans is one of an alcohol-associated resource. On the other hand, in certain places D. simulans has displaced D. melanogaster, for reasons as yet unknown. 5. In the laboratory, a number of experiments at the intraspecific and interspecific levels show differences in fitness-associated traits, such as viability at different stages of the life cycle, oviposition sites, and pupation sites. The results are difficult to interpret, often being dependent upon strain, temperature, or level of competition. Studies over a series of temperatures assessing fitness parameters for many strains of both species are needed before extrapolation to the natural environment is possible. The same problem occurs when population-cage competition experiments betweeen the two species are considered, although some of these experiments have shown that competition itself is controlled by natural selection. 6. The differences between the two species are, in general, quantitative rather than qualitative, so that, with the exception of alcohol, both species use rather similar environmental resources. The potential for rapid increases in the spring suggests that both species are more r strategists than K strategists. In the wild, while some niches, such as alcohol-associated resources, can be defined, it is imperative to define the resources used in nature in order to achieve a more complete comparative evolutionary biology of the two species. The value of the two species in linking behavior, ecology, and genetics is only just now being realized after over half a century of studying them exclusively in various laboratory containers.",32f6e54727da002c8487406b2f6451d037afe676,,
10.1038/s43705-023-00331-8,Exploring the competitive dynamic enzyme allocation scheme through enzyme cost minimization,"Enzyme allocation (or synthesis) is a crucial microbial trait that mediates soil biogeochemical cycles and their responses to climate change. However, few microbial ecological models address this trait, particularly concerning multiple enzyme functional groups that regulate complex biogeochemical processes. Here, we aim to fill this gap by developing a COmpetitive Dynamic Enzyme ALlocation (CODEAL) scheme for six enzyme groups that act as indicators of inorganic nitrogen (N) transformations in the Microbial-ENzyme Decomposition (MEND) model. This allocation scheme employs time-variant allocation coefficients for each enzyme group, fostering mutual competition among the multiple groups. We show that the principle of enzyme cost minimization is achieved by using the substrate’s saturation level as the factor for enzyme allocation, resulting in an enzyme-efficient pathway with minimal enzyme cost per unit metabolic flux. It suggests that the relative substrate availability affects the trade-off between enzyme production and metabolic flux. Our research has the potential to give insights into the nuanced dynamics of the N cycle and inspire the evolving landscape of enzyme-mediated biogeochemical processes in microbial ecological modeling, which is gaining increasing attention.",36b82a6cb9432c6a09c727a4ff606d3e16673c37,,
10.33730/2310-4678.4.2023.292721,THE ROLE OF SNAKE VENOM IN THE BIOTIC INTERACTION,"It is highlighted the ecological significance of biotic interactions. Biotic relationships can be intra- or interspecific, positive or negative and cover a wide range of interactions, including predation, commensalism, mutualism, competition and parasitism. It is indicated that snake venoms, which are the best studied, attract the greatest attention of researchers. The role of predators in the formation of the structure and functioning of ecosystems is analyzed. It has been established that the predator–prey ecological interaction causes mutual physiological, morphological and behavioral adaptations at the individual, intra- and inter-species levels. It is noted that toxins are important adaptation that arose due to evolution. Representatives of venomous animals are present in every ecosystem, more than 250,000 species of animals use their venom for predation, as well as for defense and survival. Іnformation about the types of poisonous and venomous animals is summarized in the article. The composition of animal venoms and the pathological consequences of their influence are presented. It is noted that the lost of habitats, climate change and biological invasions pose a threat to ecological processes that are associated with the interaction between species. The importance of snakes for ecosystems, their significance for trophic network and regulating pests is highlighted. It was found that from an ecological point of view, snake venom is an important functional trait that mediates biotic interaction between several organisms. Аt the same time it is a stressful biotic factor for other living beings",385609c51b41b332913a582b8eb5a31d87143925,,
10.1038/srep24021,Determinants of emigration and their impact on survival during dispersal in fox and jackal populations,"Animals disperse in response to poor resource conditions as a strategy of escaping harsh competition and stress, but may also disperse under good resource conditions, as these provide better chances of surviving dispersal and gaining fitness benefits such as avoiding kin competition and inbreeding. Individual traits should mediate the effect of resources, yielding a complex condition-dependent dispersal response. We investigated how experimental food reductions in a food-rich environment around poultry-growing villages interact with individual-traits (age, gender, body-mass) in two sympatric canids, red foxes and golden jackals, to jointly affect emigration propensity and survival during dispersal. Sub-adult foxes emigrated more frequently from the food-rich habitat than from the pristine, food-limited habitat, while adult foxes showed the opposite trend. During dispersal, adults exhibited lower survival while sub-adults did not experience additional mortality costs. Although fox mortality rates increased in response to food reduction, dispersal remained unchanged, while jackals showed strong dispersal response in two of the three repetitions. Jackal survival under food reduction was lowest for the dispersing individuals. While resources are an important dispersal determinant, different age classes and species experience the same resource environment differently and consequently have different motivations, yielding different dispersal responses and consequences.",38fcf6c1c4e6dbd1ef281434623a21e1bf901c95,,

Tropical Tree Growth and Its Response to Climate Anomalies Is Mediated by Neighbourhood Hierarchy and Dissimilarity in Carbon‐ and Water‐Related Traits,"ABSTRACT Taxonomic diversity effects on forest productivity and response to climate extremes range from positive to negative, suggesting a key role for complex interactions among neighbouring trees. To elucidate how neutral interactions, hierarchical competition and resource partitioning between neighbours' shape tree growth and climate response in a highly diverse Amazonian forest, we combined 30 years of tree censuses with measurements of water‐ and carbon‐related traits. We modelled individual tree growth response to climate and neighbourhood to disentangle the relative effect of neighbourhood densities, trait hierarchies and dissimilarities. While neighbourhood densities consistently decreased growth, trait dissimilarity increased it, and both had the potential to influence climate response. Greater water conservatism provided a competitive advantage to focal trees in normal years, but water–spender neighbours reduced this effect in dry years. By underlining the importance of density and trait‐mediated neighbourhood interactions, our study offers a way towards improving predictions of forest dynamics.",392407c5f3c35e8063ac9c4b9aaec6a71886de98,,
10.1086/718684,Niche Packing and Local Coexistence in a Megadiverse Guild of Frugivorous Birds Are Mediated by Fruit Dependence and Shifts in Interaction Frequencies,"Niche packing is one of the prevailing mechanisms underlying the increase in the number of co-occurring species and the extraordinary diversity of tropical ecosystems. However, it is not yet understood whether niche packing is facilitated by higher specialization and reduced niche overlap or, rather, by diffuse competition and increased niche overlap. We combined highly resolved bird-plant interaction networks, bird phylogenies, and plant functional traits to compare dietary niche overlap and foraging frequencies among frugivorous birds at seven sites in the tropical Andes. We quantified niche overlap on the basis of the traits of the plants used by each bird and related it to the degree of niche packing at the different sites. Niche complementarity decreased with increasing niche packing, suggesting that increasingly dense niche packing is facilitated by increased niche overlap. Pairwise niche overlap was mediated by shifts in foraging frequencies away from shared resources, and it decreased with decreasing phylogenetic relatedness and increasing dependence on fruit as resource. Our findings suggest that foraging choices are a key axis of diversification in frugivorous birds and that differences in resource use frequencies are already sufficient to reduce potential competition between ecologically similar species and facilitate niche packing, especially if species differ in their dependence on particular resources.",3d2cf3292a563761899a0c484869b72885bbecb0,,
10.1111/mec.14770,"Tree, sex and size: Ecological determinants of male vs. female fecundity in three Fagus sylvatica stands","Interindividual variation in fecundities has major consequences on population evolutionary potential, through genetic drift and selection. Using two spatially explicit mating models that analyse the genotypes of seeds and seedlings, we investigated the variation of male and female fecundities within and among three European beech (Fagus sylvatica) stands situated along an altitudinal gradient. Female and male individual fecundity distributions were both skewed in this monoecious species, and we found a higher variance in female as compared to male fecundities. Both female and male fecundities increased with tree size and decreased with density and competition in the neighbourhood, the details of these effects suggesting sex‐specific strategies to deal with the impact of limited resource on fecundity. The studied populations were functionally male‐biased. Among‐individual variations in functional gender were not driven by tree size but by density and competition in the neighbourhood. Femaleness decreased under limited resource availability, an expected consequence of the higher cost of female reproduction. Considering the variation of gene flow and genetic drift across elevation, our results suggest that the adaptive potential could be enhanced by low genetic drift at low elevation, and by high pollen‐mediated gene flow at high elevation. Finally, this study predicts a more efficient response to selection for traits related to male vs. female fitness, for a given selection intensity.",49c1390f4001537dd9c1116be9018f1909b3f900,,
10.1093/ismeco/ycae148,Distinct phytoplankton size classes respond differently to biotic and abiotic factors,"Abstract The interplay between abiotic (resource supply, temperature) and biotic (grazing) factors determines growth and loss processes in phytoplankton through resource competition and trophic interactions, which are mediated by morphological traits like size. Here, we study the relative importance of grazers, water physics, and chemistry on the daily net accumulation rates (ARs) of individual phytoplankton from natural communities, grouped into six size classes from circa 10 to 500 μm. Using a Random Forest modelling approach and 4 years of daily data from a lake, we find that water temperature is generally a pivotal control of all phytoplankton ARs. At the same time, nutrients and light are important for the smallest and the largest classes. Mesozooplankton abundance is a key predictor of the AR for small phytoplankton, with microzooplankton being important for the middle-size range. In our data, large and small phytoplankton have different (seasonal) blooming patterns: small forms are favoured by low temperature and grazing, and high phosphorus levels. Larger forms show positive ARs at high temperatures and low phosphorus (being relatively insensitive to zooplankton grazing). These results help us understand the opportunities and limitations of using size to explain and model phytoplankton responses to biotic and abiotic environmental change.",5962b975451e1735bb1d7225f46dcc399c118301,,
10.1111/evo.13785,Eco‐evolutionary feedbacks between prey densities and linkage disequilibrium in the predator maintain diversity,"Diversity occurs at multiple scales. Within a single population, there is diversity in genotypes and phenotypes. At a larger scale, within ecological communities, there is diversity in species. A number of studies have investigated how diversity at these two scales influence each other through what has been termed eco‐evolutionary feedbacks. Here we study a three‐species ecological module called apparent competition, in which the predator is evolving in a trait that determines its interaction with two prey species. Unlike previous studies on apparent competition, which employed evolutionary frameworks with very simple genetics, we study an eco‐evolutionary model in which the predator's trait is determined by two recombining diallelic loci, so that its mean and variance can evolve, as well as associations (linkage disequilibrium) between the loci. We ask how eco‐evolutionary feedbacks with these two loci affect the coexistence of the prey species and the maintenance of polymorphisms within the predator species. We uncover a novel eco‐evolutionary feedback between the prey densities and the linkage disequilibrium between the predator's loci. Through a stability analysis, we demonstrate how these feedbacks affect polymorphisms at both loci and, among others, may generate stable cycling.",5c1f5eee4236efd0386a6133a849a9af121aeafb,,
10.1002/ecy.4320,Extending trait dispersion across trophic levels: Predator assemblages act as top-down filters on prey communities.,"Studies of community assembly typically focus on the effects of abiotic environmental filters and stabilizing competition on functional trait dispersion within single trophic levels. Predation is a well-known driver of community diversity and composition, yet the role of functionally diverse predator communities in filtering prey community traits has received less attention. We examined functionally diverse communities of predators (fishes) and prey (epifaunal crustaceans) in eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds in two northern California estuaries to evaluate the filtering effects of predator traits on community assembly and how filters acting on predators influence their ability to mediate prey community assembly. Fish traits related to bottom orientation were correlated with more clustered epifauna communities, and epifauna were generally overdispersed while fishes were clustered, suggesting prey may be pushed to disparate areas of trait space to avoid capture by benthic sit-and-wait predators. We also found correlations between the trait dispersions of predator and prey communities that strengthened after accounting for the effects of habitat filters on predator dispersion, suggesting that habitat filtering effects on predator species pools may hinder their ability to affect prey community assembly. Our results present compelling observational evidence that specific predator traits have measurable impacts on the community assembly of prey, inviting experimental tests of predator trait means on community assembly and explicit comparisons of how the relative effects of habitat filters and intraguild competition on predators impact their ability to affect prey community assembly. Integrating our understanding of traits at multiple trophic levels can help us better predict the impacts of community composition on food web dynamics as regional species pools shift with climate change and anthropogenic introductions.",63680b02c30004b280223c9181304595ef222d8a,,
10.1126/science.aau9460,Herbivores as drivers of negative density dependence in tropical forest saplings,"Herbivores shape tropical forests In tropical forests, high local tree diversity is driven by negative density dependence, a process whereby plant performance is inhibited by closely related neighbors. Negative density dependence could be caused by competition for resources among neighbors or result from shared herbivores and pathogens. Using data from forest plots in Panama, Forrister et al. compared the contributions of these mechanisms. They found no effect of competition, but strong effects of plant chemistry and shared herbivores on coexisting Inga tree species. Science, this issue p. 1213 Damage to saplings by herbivores rather than resource competition maintains local tree diversity in tropical rainforests. Ecological theory predicts that the high local diversity observed in tropical forests is maintained by negative density–dependent interactions within and between closely related plant species. By using long-term data on tree growth and survival for coexisting Inga (Fabaceae, Mimosoideae) congeners, we tested two mechanisms thought to underlie negative density dependence (NDD): competition for resources and attack by herbivores. We quantified the similarity of neighbors in terms of key ecological traits that mediate these interactions, as well as the similarity of herbivore communities. We show that phytochemical similarity and shared herbivore communities are associated with decreased growth and survival at the sapling stage, a key bottleneck in the life cycle of tropical trees. None of the traits associated with resource acquisition affect plant performance, indicating that competition between neighbors may not shape local tree diversity. These results suggest that herbivore pressure is the primary mechanism driving NDD at the sapling stage.",7798c03cafa9bfbb11500d17b9682d26f2a55558,,
10.1111/1365-2435.12685,Soil‐mediated eco‐evolutionary feedbacks in the invasive plant Alliaria petiolata,"Summary Ecological and evolutionary processes historically have been assumed to operate on significantly different time‐scales. We know now from theory and work in experimental and model systems that these processes can feed back on each other on mutually relevant time‐scales. Here, we present evidence of a soil‐mediated eco‐evolutionary feedback on the population dynamics of an invasive biennial plant, Alliaria petiolata. As populations age, natural selection drives down production of A. petiolata's important antimycorrhizal allelochemical, sinigrin. This occurs due to density‐dependent selection on sinigrin, which is favoured under interspecific, but disfavoured under intraspecific, competition. We show that population stochastic growth rates (λS) and plant densities are positively related to sinigrin concentration measured in seedling roots. This interaction is mediated by sinigrin's positive effect on seedling and summer survival, which are important drivers of λS. Together, these illustrate how the evolution of a trait shaped by natural selection can influence the ecology of a species over a period of just years to decades, altering its trajectory of population growth and interactions with the species in the soil and plant communities it invades. Our findings confirm the predictions that eco‐evolutionary feedbacks occur in natural populations. Furthermore, they improve our conceptual framework for projecting future population growth by linking the variation in plant demography to a critical competitive trait (sinigrin) whose selective advantages decrease as populations age.",7efe0009bcb665ffca2a364f3430092f6af0d834,,
10.1111/nph.17037,Competition-induced transgenerational plasticity influences competitive interactions and leaf decomposition of offspring.,"Phenotypic plasticity, within and across generations (transgenerational plasticity), allows organisms and their progeny to adapt to the environment without modification of the underlying DNA. Recent findings suggest that epigenetic modifications are important mediators of such plasticity. However, empirical studies have, so far, mainly focused on plasticity in response to abiotic factors, overlooking the response to competition. We tested for within-generation and transgenerational phenotypic plasticity triggered by plant-plant competition intensity, and tested whether it was mediated via DNA methylation, using the perennial, apomictic herb Taraxacum brevicorniculatum in four coordinated experiments. We then tested the consequences of transgenerational plasticity affecting competitive interactions of the offspring and ecosystem processes such as decomposition. We found that, by promoting differences in DNA methylation, offspring of plants under stronger competition developed faster and presented more resource-conservative phenotypes. Further, these adjustments associated with less degradable leaves which have the potential to reduce nutrient turnover and might, in turn, favour plants with more conservative traits. Greater parental competition enhanced competitive abilities of the offspring by triggering adaptive phenotypic plasticity, and decreased offspring leaf decomposability. Our results suggest that competition-induced transgenerational effects could promote rapid adaptations and species coexistence, and feed back on biodiversity assembly and nutrient cycling.",880647bcc951344f5d6d6ae7beb830838e0aff06,,
10.3389/fmicb.2014.00497,"When, where and how does microbial community composition matter?","Our planet is experiencing rates of environmental change unprecedented in modern times, and an understanding of how microbes both mediate and respond to these shifts is an important research challenge (De Vries and Shade, 2013). Because of the temporal and spatial scales over which microbes function as well as their extreme diversity, dynamics in microbial structure and processes are typically examined at the community level. However, the factors that drive patterns in microbial structure and function, and the links between them, remain widely debated (Prosser et al., 2007). In this issue, such patterns in microbial communities are further documented for soils, lakes, streams and ocean provinces (Arnosti et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2012; King et al., 2012; Larouche et al., 2012). Additionally, the importance of spatial and temporal dynamics (Armitage et al., 2012; Arnosti et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2012; Larouche et al., 2012) and interactions with macrobiota (King et al., 2012) in driving these patterns is demonstrated. Yet, a central but unanswered question is: “does knowing who is there help us to better understand what they are doing?” Indeed, as shown here by Salles et al. (2012), links between structure and function can often be weak, both at the level of the individual and at the level of the community. Several papers in this special issue, “The Causes and Consequences of Microbial Community Structure,” use empirical or modeling approaches as well as literature reviews to enrich our mechanistic understanding of the controls over the relationship between community structure and ecosystem processes. Specifically, authors address the role of trait distributions and trade-offs, species-species interactions, evolutionary dynamics, community assembly processes and physical controls in affecting “who's there” and “what they are doing.” 
 
Trait-based approaches can provide mechanistic links between community structure and function, and are gaining popularity in microbial ecology (Krause et al., 2014). Importantly, the distribution of traits within a community may affect the relationship between structure and function (Webb et al., 2010). Thus, as highlighted in this issue by Comte et al. (2013), traits can be considered at both the individual and the community level, where trait distributions may have important implications for emergent properties (e.g., redundancy). Indeed, Shade et al. (2012) highlight a variety of traits that may govern the stability of individual organisms, populations and communities including plasticity, tolerance and dormancy. Folse and Allison (2012) used a multi-nutrient, multi-genotype model of enzyme activity, and showed that trait distributions could yield insight into the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function. They found that generalists dominated at low levels of community diversity when rates of enzyme production and enzyme diffusion were lowest. Matias et al. (2013) used a simple microcosm experiment and examined the response of assembled communities to fluctuations in salinity. Their results were somewhat different from Folse and Allison (2012), as they found that community diversity was positively related to productivity and that generalists were more productive and less variable over time. Their work also showed that there did not appear to be a fitness trade-off associated with generalization. Comte et al. (2013) took a novel approach to examine plasticity and redundancy in freshwater bacterioplankton communities, and described explicit metrics to track these traits within community transplant experiments. They showed that plasticity appeared to be an intrinsic community property while redundancy was affected by external environmental factors. Their work also revealed strong relationships between community plasticity and redundancy, with no evidence for trade-offs and a possible co-selection of these attributes. 
 
As well, species-species interactions can affect the relationship between communities and processes. In the model presented by Folse and Allison (2012), the importance of both “coalitions” of complementary organisms and the abundance of “cheaters,” or organisms that use a public good without contributing to its production, increased under high levels of enzyme production. They also found that the presence of cheaters could affect the relationship between biodiversity and function. Fox (2012) offered a cautionary tale in terms of our ability to interpret relationships between abundance and “adaptedness” because of organismal interactions. He used a consumer-resource model to demonstrate that, at medium levels of niche overlap, outcomes of competition can be unpredictable, decoupling relationships between abundance and adaptation. 
 
Evolutionary dynamics can also alter relationships between structure and function. In a Perspectives Article, Choudoir et al. (2012) advocate for population-level approaches to examining microbial community diversity, emphasizing that organisms with exactly the same 16S rRNA gene sequence can exhibit very different ecological dynamics. Indeed, Salles et al. (2012) examined the links between rates of denitrification and phylogenies and highlighted the potential importance of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) by showing that similarity in nirK genes, which are thought to be subject to HGT, is not related to N2O accumulation rates. Furthermore, for nirS and 16S rRNA genes, Salles et al. (2012) showed that there was more explanatory power between structure and function at finer scales of phylogenetic resolution for denitrification and metabolic profiles respectively. Pearce et al. (2012) used metagenomics to examine a soil microbial community from Mars Oasis, Antarctica, and showed that while genera-level diversity was limited, species-level diversity was high. They proposed that this suggests strong selection on the types of taxa that can inhabit this extreme environment combined with high rates of diversification within those lineages. Related, Knope et al. (2012) used a microcosm approach to examine the importance of evolutionary history for diversification in bacteria. They showed that prior exposure to an environmental challenge led to higher rates of diversification. These studies suggest that understanding the coupling of ecological and evolutionary processes is key for interpreting microbial community patterns of structure and function. 
 
Community assembly processes may also alter the relationship between “who's there” and “what they do” (Nemergut et al., 2013). Knope et al. (2012) found that arriving in a community first led to a greater degree of diversification within bacteria, likely because of niche-preemption. Pholchan et al. (2013) used a variety of manipulations to alter microbial community assembly in sludge reactors and showed that relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function in these systems were unpredictable. They hypothesized that the relative importance of stochastic vs. deterministic assembly processes could change the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function. In their comment on the Pholchan manuscript, Knelman and Nemergut (2014) provide a conceptual framework illustrating how assembly, biodiversity and function may be related. Together, these studies provide growing evidence for the importance of assembly processes in determining microbial community properties. 
 
Physical dynamics may also be key in regulating the relationship between structure and function. Schimel and Schaeffer (2012) propose a conceptual framework that highlights a requirement that biological processes need to be rate limiting or fate determining in order for community structure to matter for ecosystem function. For example, they propose that structure is not likely to be relevant for organic matter breakdown in mineral soils, where diffusion is limited and organic particles may be occluded or sorbed to soil surfaces. Likewise, Folse and Allison (2012) demonstrate that rates of diffusion of enzymes can affect community diversity and the relative proportion of generalists to specialists. Their work also showed high rates of diffusion coupled to high rates of production can lead to community bottlenecks and increases in stochasticity. As well, King et al. (2012) found that physical dynamics may also affect biotic relationships. They found that associations between plants and microbial community composition were less pronounced at higher elevations, likely due to an increase in the influence of physical harshness on community composition. 
 
Together, the studies in this special issue highlight the role of a variety of ecological, evolutionary and physical dynamics in microbial community structure and function (Figure ​(Figure1).1). This body of work emphasizes the importance of emergent, aggregate community properties and the role of community dynamics in variations in the strength of the structure-function relationships. As Schimel wrote in 1995 “At a small enough scale, microbial community structure must be a dominant control on ecological processes, but as we move up in scale toward the ecosystem and integrate across many individual communities, the influence of microbial community structures decreases.” Predicting when, where, how, and at what scale microbial communities may respond to environmental changes remains a research priority and these papers present new insights into this challenge.

10.1098/rspb.2022.0504,Trait-mediated competition drives an ant invasion and alters functional diversity,"The assumption that differences in species' traits reflect their different niches has long influenced how ecologists infer processes from assemblage patterns. For instance, many assess the importance of environmental filtering versus classical limiting-similarity competition in driving biological invasions by examining whether invaders’ traits are similar or dissimilar to those of residents, respectively. However, mounting evidence suggests that hierarchical differences between species' trait values can distinguish their competitive abilities (e.g. for the same resource) instead of their niches. Whether such trait-mediated hierarchical competition explains invasions and structures assemblages is less explored. We integrate morphological, dietary, physiological and behavioural trait analyses to test whether environmental filtering, limiting-similarity competition or hierarchical competition explain invasions by fire ants on ant assemblages. We detect both competition mechanisms; invasion success is not only explained by limiting similarity in body size and thermal tolerance (presumably allowing the invader to exploit different niches from residents), but also by the invader's superior position in trait hierarchies reflecting competition for common trophic resources. We find that the two mechanisms generate complex assemblage-level functional diversity patterns—overdispersion in some traits, clustering in others—suggesting their effects are likely missed by analyses restricted to a few traits and composite trait diversity measures.",90c4b430f2d78721be333de757c02376e3d42156,,
10.1002/ppp3.10596,Selection for domestication favored taxa characterized by fast growth and tolerance of high intraspecific density,"To understand why certain plants have been domesticated into crops, we need to recognize that the environmental conditions plants experience in wild populations are totally different from those of agricultural fields. In this study, we investigated whether the characteristics that promote growth and survival in these different environments may have influenced domestication. Our results revealed that ancestral crops were selected because they developed better than other plants in dense single‐species stands, with selection for increased yield likely occurring after domestication. These insights shed light on the origins of agriculture and offer valuable guidance for future crop breeding efforts.

In spite of a large history of research, it is still unclear which functional traits may have mediated plant domestication. Solving this problem requires consideration of the ecological and demographic disparities between natural plant populations and cultivated fields. Since population density tends to be higher in the latter, we hypothesized that traits facilitating growth and survival in dense, monospecific populations might have been relevant for initial domestication.
We investigated whether functional traits that respond to population density varied across three different domestication stages: undomesticated crop wild relatives, natural populations of crop progenitors, and landraces. To do this, we compared traits influencing competition (lodging; growth rate), resource acquisition (plant height; total aerial and root biomass) and yield (fruit number) in three annual legume crops—lentil, grasspea, and vetch—grown without resource limitation at three different densities.
Our results showed clear differences among species, likely reflective of the distinct uses of the crops and their domestication pathways. Nevertheless, undomesticated relatives consistently differed from crop progenitors and landraces, producing smaller, slower‐growing plants that were more prostrate and allocated less biomass to roots. The effect of selection under domestication on these vegetative traits appeared to be largely negligible. Conversely, landraces produced more fruits.
We conclude that early agriculturalists selected for domestication wild legumes that performed well in dense monocultures and were more effective in resource capture. Later domestication and breeding efforts likely had more significant effects on reproductive traits, such as fruit and seed production.

10.1002/ece3.8388,Metabolic phenotype mediates the outcome of competitive interactions in a response‐surface field experiment,"Abstract Competition and metabolism should be linked. Intraspecific variation in metabolic rates and, hence, resource demands covary with competitive ability. The effects of metabolism on conspecific interactions, however, have mostly been studied under laboratory conditions. We used a trait‐specific response‐surface design to test for the effects of metabolism on pairwise interactions of the marine colonial invertebrate, Bugula neritina in the field. Specifically, we compared the performance (survival, growth, and reproduction) of focal individuals, both in the presence and absence of a neighbor colony, both of which had their metabolic phenotype characterized. Survival of focal colonies depended on the metabolic phenotype of the neighboring individual, and on the combination of both the focal and neighbor colony metabolic phenotypes that were present. Surprisingly, we found pervasive effects of neighbor metabolic phenotypes on focal colony growth and reproduction, although the sign and strength of these effects showed strong microenvironmental variability. Overall, we find that the metabolic phenotype changes the strength of competitive interactions, but these effects are highly contingent on local conditions. We suggest future studies explore how variation in metabolic rate affects organisms beyond the focal organism alone, particularly under field conditions.",96b991f5f881b2df26549d9ab2b1486a42ab5083,,
10.1111/rec.14354,The role of habitat in predator–prey dynamics with applications to restoration,"Habitat is a powerful force in ecosystems, and the quantity and quality of habitat can shape ecosystem structure and function. Among the many important roles that habitat plays is as a mediator of ecological interactions, including predator–prey dynamics. In the context of ecosystem restoration, there is great potential to better understand how predator–prey dynamics are influenced by habitat and whether this has implications for how ecosystems are managed. We consider the ways in which habitat serves as an important mediator of interactions between predators and their prey and present four ways in which habitat acts as an intermediary that enhances or diminishes this relationship. We found that habitat provides refuge from predators and shapes the physical traits of prey as they use their surroundings to protect themselves. We also discuss how habitat creates physical resistance and sets the cost of predation for predators and how habitat facilitates apparent competition within a community context. These roles of habitat are well established in ecology, but we believe they are underdeveloped from an applied perspective. We conclude that habitat must be appropriately considered in the context of how it mediates predation. Given the ways that habitat influences predation, restoration efforts should consider if and how physical measures may positively or negatively affect species interactions and whether this could lead to success or failure of overall programs.",a24cbe048fd85dc274ed701906e7687fdce86e28,,

When IAS and their parasite(s) invade a guild, the effects of interspecific resource competition and/or parasite-mediated competition can alter existing native host-parasite relationships and the dependent biological traits such as native species' behaviour. We used a natural experiment of populations of native red squirrels Sciurus vulgaris that were colonized by the alien grey squirrel Sciurus carolinensis, comparing repeated measurements of red squirrel parasite infection and personality with those taken in sites where only the native species occurred. We explored two alternative hypotheses: (a) individual differences in personality traits (activity and/or sociability) of native red squirrel positively affect the probability of macroparasite spillover and thus the likelihood to acquire the alien's parasitic helminth Strongyloides robustus; (b) the combined effects of grey squirrel presence and parasite infection result in a reduction of costly personality traits (activity and/or exploration). Using data from 323 arena tests across three experimental (native species and IAS) and three control sites (only native species), we found negative correlations between native species' activity and infection with S. robustus in the sites invaded by the alien species. Activity was also negatively correlated with infection by its native helminth Trypanoxyuris sciuri but only when grey squirrels were present, while in the red-only sites there was no relationship of T. sciuri infection with any of the personality traits. Moreover, individuals that acquired S. robustus during the study reduced their activity after infection, while this was not the case for animals that remained uninfected. Our results show that parasite-mediated competition is costly, reducing activity in individuals of the native species, and altering the native host-native parasite relationships.",a2daa8581a3d839b4ab139c2ccde74f4cfefd47f,,
10.1111/gcb.70051,Local‐ and Regional‐Scale Climate Variability Drives Complex Patterns of Growth Synchrony and Asynchrony in Deep‐Sea Snappers Across the Indo‐Pacific,"Climatic variation can play a critical role in driving synchronous and asynchronous patterns in the expression of life history characteristics across vast spatiotemporal scales. The synchronisation of traits, such as an individual's growth rate, under environmental stress may indicate a loss of phenotypic diversity and thus increased population vulnerability to stochastic deleterious events. In contrast, synchronous growth under favourable ecological conditions and asynchrony during unfavourable conditions may help population resilience and buffer against the negative implications of future environmental variability. Despite the significant implications of growth synchrony and asynchrony to population productivity and persistence, little is known about its causes and consequences either within or among fish populations. This is especially true for long‐lived deep‐sea species that inhabit environments characterised by large‐scale interannual and decadal changes, which could propagate growth synchrony across vast distances. We developed otolith growth chronologies for three deep‐sea fishes (Etelis spp.) over 65° of longitude and 20° of latitude across the Indo‐Pacific region. Using reconstructed time series of interannual growth from six distinct Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), we assessed the level of spatial synchrony at the individual‐, population‐ and species‐scale. Across five decades of data, complex patterns of synchronous and asynchronous growth were apparent for adult populations within and among EEZs of the Pacific Ocean, mediated by shifts in oceanographic phenomena such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Overall, our results indicate that the degree of synchrony in biological traits at depth depends on life history stage, spatiotemporal scales of environmental variability and the influence of ecological factors such as competition and dispersal. By determining the magnitude and timing of spatially synchronous growth at depth and its links to environmental variability, we can better understand fluctuations in deep‐sea productivity and its vulnerability to future environmental stressors, which are key considerations for sustainability.",a2ea6c7720e3d6ee5e0bd33991772d755aeba80b,,
10.1371/journal.pone.0007423,Species-Specific Traits Rather Than Resource Partitioning Mediate Diversity Effects on Resource Use,"Background The link between biodiversity and ecosystem processes has firmly been established, but the mechanisms underpinning this relationship are poorly documented. Most studies have focused on terrestrial plant systems where resource use can be difficult to quantify as species rely on a limited number of common resources. Investigating resource use at the bulk level may not always be of sufficient resolution to detect subtle differences in resource use, as species-specific nutritional niches at the biochemical level may also moderate diversity effects on resource use. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we use three co-occurring marine benthic echinoderms (Brissopsis lyrifera, Mesothuria intestinalis, Parastichopus tremulus) that feed on the same phytodetrital food source, to determine whether resource partitioning is the principal mechanism underpinning diversity effects on resource use. Specifically we investigate the use of phytodetrital pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) because many of these are essential for biological functions, including reproduction. Pigments were identified and quantified using reverse-phase high performance liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and data were analysed using a combination of extended linear regression with generalised least squares (GLS) estimation and standard multivariate techniques. Our analyses reveal no species-specific selectivity for particular algal pigments, confirming that these three species do not partition food resources at the biochemical level. Nevertheless, we demonstrate increased total resource use in diverse treatments as a result of selection effects and the dominance of one species (B. lyrifera). Conclusion Overall, we found no evidence for resource partitioning at the biochemical level, as pigment composition was similar between individuals, which is likely due to plentiful food availability. Reduced intra-specific competition in the species mixture combined with greater adsorption efficiency and differences in feeding behaviour likely explain the dominant use of resources by B. lyrifera.",a506be3fd23fa2651c954e09b65b9a0acab00c67,,
10.3389/fmicb.2021.690200,Can Top-Down Controls Expand the Ecological Niche of Marine N2 Fixers?,"The ability of marine diazotrophs to fix dinitrogen gas (N2) is one of the most influential yet enigmatic processes in the ocean. With their activity diazotrophs support biological production by fixing about 100–200 Tg N/year and turning otherwise unavailable dinitrogen into bioavailable nitrogen (N), an essential limiting nutrient. Despite their important role, the factors that control the distribution of diazotrophs and their ability to fix N2 are not fully elucidated. We discuss insights that can be gained from the emerging picture of a wide geographical distribution of marine diazotrophs and provide a critical assessment of environmental (bottom-up) versus trophic (top-down) controls. We expand a simplified theoretical framework to understand how top-down control affects competition for resources that determine ecological niches. Selective mortality, mediated by grazing or viral-lysis, on non-fixing phytoplankton is identified as a critical process that can broaden the ability of diazotrophs to compete for resources in top-down controlled systems and explain an expanded ecological niche for diazotrophs. Our simplified analysis predicts a larger importance of top-down control on competition patterns as resource levels increase. As grazing controls the faster growing phytoplankton, coexistence of the slower growing diazotrophs can be established. However, these predictions require corroboration by experimental and field data, together with the identification of specific traits of organisms and associated trade-offs related to selective top-down control. Elucidation of these factors could greatly improve our predictive capability for patterns and rates of marine N2 fixation. The susceptibility of this key biogeochemical process to future changes may not only be determined by changes in environmental conditions but also via changes in the ecological interactions.",a596052b50bf8d418112e228dc407db4057eea06,,

Freshwater lakes in high‐altitude areas represent a natural system for understanding resource polymorphism in fishes benefiting from diverse lacustrine environments and species‐poor fish assemblages. We report resource polymorphism in a cyprinid fish, Schizopygopsis thermalis, in Lake Amdo Tsonak Co, a headwater lake in the upper Salween River system. Two discrete intraspecific morphs, planktivorous and benthivorous, were identified according to geometric morphometrics and traditional univariate linear measures. The planktivorous morph exhibits a longer head, longer upper and lower jaw, larger asymptotic standard length (L∞), lower growth rate (k), and higher growth performance index (φ) than the benthivorous morph. With respect to descriptive traits, the planktivorous morph possesses a large, terminal mouth and obvious mucus pores on the cheek and chin, while the benthivorous morph is characterized by a more inferior mouth with a sharpen horny edge on the lower jaw and unconspicuous mucus pores. The discrete pelagic–benthic resources and low interspecific competition in the lake system might drive the initial differentiation of the two morphs, and partial spatial reproductive isolation in breeding further maintains and reinforces the differences between them.",b2dd95ecc9a08682515a527a8c6de0f2f1342aa2,,
10.1098/rspb.2007.1713,CD4+T cells do not mediate within-host competition between genetically diverse malaria parasites,"Ecological interactions between microparasite populations in the same host are an important source of selection on pathogen traits such as virulence and drug resistance. In the rodent malaria model Plasmodium chabaudi in laboratory mice, parasites that are more virulent can competitively suppress less virulent parasites in mixed infections. There is evidence that some of this suppression is due to immune-mediated apparent competition, where an immune response elicited by one parasite population suppress the population density of another. This raises the question whether enhanced immunity following vaccination would intensify competitive interactions, thus strengthening selection for virulence in Plasmodium populations. Using the P. chabaudi model, we studied mixed infections of virulent and avirulent genotypes in CD4+T cell-depleted mice. Enhanced efficacy of CD4+T cell-dependent responses is the aim of several candidate malaria vaccines. We hypothesized that if immune-mediated interactions were involved in competition, removal of the CD4+T cells would alleviate competitive suppression of the avirulent parasite. Instead, we found no alleviation of competition in the acute phase, and significant enhancement of competitive suppression after parasite densities had peaked. Thus, the host immune response may actually be alleviating other forms of competition, such as that over red blood cells. Our results suggest that the CD4+-dependent immune response, and mechanisms that act to enhance it such as vaccination, may not have the undesirable affect of exacerbating within-host competition and hence the strength of this source of selection for virulence.",b4c6554fae236c260ee8ff8a0c08e0c59d39e649,,
10.3390/ani13071264,Factor in Fear: Interference Competition in Polymorphic Spadefoot Toad Tadpoles and Its Potential Role in Disruptive Selection,"Simple Summary Disruptive selection occurs when extreme phenotypes have a fitness advantage over intermediate phenotypes, thereby favoring the evolution and maintenance of diversity within populations. Resource competition within populations is an important cause of disruptive selection. Individuals can compete in two distinct ways: either by depleting resources (exploitative/indirect competition) or by impeding a competitor’s access to resources (interference/direct competition). However, it is generally assumed that exploitative competition is of greater importance for disruptive selection, while interference competition is rarely considered. Here, we experimentally explored the role of interference competition using a well-known example of disruptive selection, the Mexican spadefoot toad (Spea multiplicata), whose tadpoles develop into alternative resource-use specialists (omnivores and carnivores) while generalist, intermediate tadpoles are disfavored by disruptive selection. Our behavioral experiments revealed that intermediate tadpoles decreased their foraging in the presence of carnivores, while our competition experiment showed that interference competition with carnivores, but not omnivores, significantly lowered growth rates in intermediate tadpoles. Therefore, interference competition may be important in causing disruptive selection. Furthermore, we found that ‘fear’ (phenotypic responses to perceived predation risk) could mediate interference competition as carnivores (who are also cannibalistic) were responsible for both behavioral alterations and a decreased growth rate when direct interaction was possible. Abstract Disruptive selection arises when extreme phenotypes have a fitness advantage compared to more-intermediate phenotypes. Theory and evidence suggest that intraspecific resource competition is a key driver of disruptive selection. However, while competition can be indirect (exploitative) or direct (interference), the role of interference competition in disruptive selection has not been tested, and most models of disruptive selection assume exploitative competition. We experimentally investigated whether the type of competition affects the outcome of competitive interactions using a system where disruptive selection is common: Mexican spadefoot toads (Spea multiplicata). Spea tadpoles develop into alternative resource-use phenotypes: carnivores, which consume fairy shrimp and other tadpoles, and omnivores, which feed on algae and detritus. Tadpoles intermediate in phenotype have low fitness when competition is intense, as they are outcompeted by the specialized tadpoles. Our experiments revealed that the presence of carnivores significantly decreased foraging behavior in intermediate tadpoles, and that intermediate tadpoles had significantly lower growth rates in interference competition treatments with carnivores but not with omnivores. Interference competition may therefore be important in driving disruptive selection. As carnivore tadpoles are also cannibalistic, the ‘fear’ effect may have a greater impact on intermediate tadpoles than exploitative competition alone, similarly to non-consumptive effects in predator–prey or intraguild relationships.",b5ac8daef6d22fbbfe15215579c037fa58f7e5c7,,
10.1002/ecy.1639,Invasion of a dominant floral resource: effects on the floral community and pollination of native plants.,"Through competition for pollinators, invasive plants may suppress native flora. Community-level studies provide an integrative assessment of invasion impacts and insights into factors that influence the vulnerability of different native species. We investigated effects of the nonnative herb Lythrum salicaria on pollination of native species in 14 fens of the eastern United States. We compared visitors per flower for 122 native plant species in invaded and uninvaded fens and incorporated a landscape-scale experiment, removing L. salicaria flowers from three of the invaded fens. Total flower densities were more than three times higher in invaded than uninvaded or removal sites when L. salicaria was blooming. Despite an increase in number of visitors with number of flowers per area, visitors per native flower declined with increasing numbers of flowers. Therefore, L. salicaria invasion depressed visitation to native flowers. In removal sites, visitation to native flowers was similar to uninvaded sites, confirming the observational results and also suggesting that invasion had not generated a persistent build-up of visitor populations. To study species-level impacts, we examined effects of invasion on visitors per flower for the 36 plant species flowering in both invaded and uninvaded fens. On average, the effect of invasion represented about a 20% reduction in visits per flower. We measured the influence of plant traits on vulnerability to L. salicaria invasion using meta-analysis. Bilaterally symmetrical flowers experienced stronger impacts on visitation, and similarity in flower color to L. salicaria weakly intensified competition with the invader for visitors. Finally, we assessed the reproductive consequences of competition with the invader in a dominant flowering shrub, Dasiphora fruticosa. Despite the negative effect of invasion on pollinator visitation in this species, pollen limitation of seed production was not stronger in invaded than in uninvaded sites, suggesting little impact of competition for pollinators on its population demography. Negative effects on pollination of native plants by this copiously flowering invader appeared to be mediated by increases in total flower density that were not matched by increases in pollinator density. The strength of impact was modulated across native species by their floral traits and reproductive ecology.",b606f7071dc481f60e29a67d8454c3e70e98da0a,,
10.1002/ece3.4145,Not attackable or not crackable—How pre‐ and post‐attack defenses with different competition costs affect prey coexistence and population dynamics,"Abstract It is well‐known that prey species often face trade‐offs between defense against predation and competitiveness, enabling predator‐mediated coexistence. However, we lack an understanding of how the large variety of different defense traits with different competition costs affects coexistence and population dynamics. Our study focusses on two general defense mechanisms, that is, pre‐attack (e.g., camouflage) and post‐attack defenses (e.g., weaponry) that act at different phases of the predator—prey interaction. We consider a food web model with one predator, two prey types and one resource. One prey type is undefended, while the other one is pre‐ or post‐attack defended paying costs either by a higher half‐saturation constant for resource uptake or a lower maximum growth rate. We show that post‐attack defenses promote prey coexistence and stabilize the population dynamics more strongly than pre‐attack defenses by interfering with the predator's functional response: Because the predator spends time handling “noncrackable” prey, the undefended prey is indirectly facilitated. A high half‐saturation constant as defense costs promotes coexistence more and stabilizes the dynamics less than a low maximum growth rate. The former imposes high costs at low resource concentrations but allows for temporally high growth rates at predator‐induced resource peaks preventing the extinction of the defended prey. We evaluate the effects of the different defense mechanisms and costs on coexistence under different enrichment levels in order to vary the importance of bottom‐up and top‐down control of the prey community.",bea47f077d74ff393efb0f398b5af02f31ca75e8,,
10.1002/ece3.9599,Can diet niche partitioning enhance sexual dimorphism?,"Abstract Classic evolutionary theory suggests that sexual dimorphism evolves primarily via sexual and fecundity selection. However, theory and evidence are beginning to accumulate suggesting that resource competition can drive the evolution of sexual dimorphism, via ecological character displacement between sexes. A key prediction of this hypothesis is that the extent of ecological divergence between sexes will be associated with the extent of sexual dimorphism. As the stable isotope ratios of animal tissues provide a quantitative measure of various aspects of ecology, we carried out a meta‐analysis examining associations between the extent of isotopic divergence between sexes and the extent of body size dimorphism. Our models demonstrate that large amounts of between‐study variation in isotopic (ecological) divergence between sexes is nonrandom and may be associated with the traits of study subjects. We, therefore, completed meta‐regressions to examine whether the extent of isotopic divergence between sexes is associated with the extent of sexual size dimorphism. We found modest but significantly positive associations across species between size dimorphism and ecological differences between sexes, that increased in strength when the ecological opportunity for dietary divergence between sexes was greatest. Our results, therefore, provide further evidence that ecologically mediated selection, not directly related to reproduction, can contribute to the evolution of sexual dimorphism.",bfcedba3b5206806d8309c4b206d4cfa408a0c0c,,
10.1126/science.aat2456,Bacterial antagonism in host-associated microbial communities,"Interspecies competition shapes communities The gut microbiota of mammals is diverse and dynamic, and gut bacteria respond sensitively to diet and drug intake. Nevertheless, in a healthy adult, microbial community composition remains remarkably stable over time, despite being highly individual. García-Bayona and Comstock review the mechanisms that gut bacterial species use to jostle for space and resources and maintain their populations in the face of intense and varied competition. Bacteria have evolved a range of antibiotics, bacteriocins, toxins, and delivery devices to enable interspecies conflict. These interbacterial weapons possess a spectrum of specificities and range from those that target strains of their own species to broad-acting bacteriocides. This toxic armamentarium provides a valuable resource for potential therapeutic development. Science, this issue p. eaat2456 BACKGROUND Microbial communities are ubiquitous on Earth. The microbiota of different habitats are diverse and have distinct functional traits, but there are common ecological principles that govern their composition. The ability of a microbe to compete with other members of its community for resources is paramount to its success. Competition through the production of molecules that harm other members, known as interference competition, is also important in the assembly and maintenance of microbial communities. As new technologies allow for more in-depth analyses of microbial communities and their genetic content, we are better able to identify new antimicrobial toxins and analyze the effects of their production. Here, we explore the range of antibacterial protein/peptide toxins and toxin-secretion systems, together with the fitness benefits they confer to the producing organisms. Because human-associated microbial communities have been intensely studied over the past decade, our focus is on the growing body of data regarding bacterial antagonism in these and other host-associated microbial communities. ADVANCES Studies continue to reveal the large arsenal of antibacterial peptides and proteins that bacteria produce and the secretion systems that they use to deliver these toxins to competing cells. Bacterially produced antimicrobial peptides and proteins are diverse in terms of their structures, cellular targets, mechanisms of action, and spatial range. Their antagonistic range also varies; some are limited to intraspecies killing, whereas others are able to kill across genera, families, and orders. Through a combination of mathematical modeling and experimental model systems, the ecological outcomes of bacterial antagonism are being elucidated. In vivo analyses in host models have shown that some antimicrobial toxins play a role in microbiota-mediated colonization resistance by preventing invasion of pathogens. Some pathogens, however, also use toxins to battle with the resident microbiota to invade an ecosystem and cause disease. Antagonism has also been shown to facilitate genome evolution; the DNA released from killed cells can be taken up and incorporated into the aggressor’s genome. In some cases, antagonism has been shown to increase rather than reduce microbial diversity, potentially through promotion of spatial segregation of competing strains, facilitating the exchange of signals and secreted products between related cells (kin). The factors that regulate the production and release of some antibacterial toxins are also becoming better understood. Studies are revealing that toxin producers respond to various environmental signals, including signals that indicate host occupancy, that nutrients are limiting, or that they may be attacked by other bacterial community members. OUTLOOK Although bacterial antagonism is an active area of research, we are still in the early stages of understanding the impacts of these interactions in natural community settings and how they influence the overall structure, dynamics, and composition of complex microbial communities. The rapid increase in the number of available metagenomic datasets derived from diverse microbial communities and the expanding capability to culture and genetically modify these organisms is allowing for the identification and characterization of new . The protective function of microbiota-produced toxins in warding off pathogens indicates a potential for applications in medical, agricultural, and other industrial settings. In addition, the inclusion of antibacterial toxins in genetically engineered bacteria (live biotherapeutics) may allow for specific targeting of harmful community members, including those involved in therapeutic failures, and may also allow a live biotherapeutic to compete with members of the microbiota to deliver various health-promoting functions. Intra- and interspecies antagonism—the example of Bacteroides species in the human gut. Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides uniformis use MACPF (membrane attack complex/perforin) toxins—BSAP-1 and BSAP-2, respectively—for intraspecies killing. Producer strains carry a modified receptor [outer membrane protein (OMP) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) glycan] that confers resistance to its cognate toxin. B. fragilis can also kill other B. fragilis strains and most gut Bacteroidales species via type VI secretion systems (T6SSs). Antagonistic interactions are abundant in microbial communities and contribute not only to the composition and relative proportions of their members but also to the longer-term stability of a community. This Review will largely focus on bacterial antagonism mediated by ribosomally synthesized peptides and proteins produced by members of host-associated microbial communities. We discuss recent findings on their diversity, functions, and ecological impacts. These systems play key roles in ecosystem defense, pathogen invasion, spatial segregation, and diversity but also confer indirect gains to the aggressor from products released by killed cells. Investigations into antagonistic bacterial interactions are important for our understanding of how the microbiota establish within hosts, influence health and disease, and offer insights into potential translational applications.",c64661161b43f837cfa9d61c10c9e8cbfcd5495a,,
10.1111/jvs.13244,Leaf trait variation in grassland plant species in response to soil phosphorus,"Increased soil phosphorus (P) availability in fertilized grasslands can drive both community degradation and delayed community recovery upon agricultural abandonment. Beyond describing grassland community patterns along gradients in P availability, it remains unclear how individual species with different strategies respond to increasing phosphorus. Here we studied intraspecific variability of leaf functional traits in response to soil phosphorus, for species with contrasting resource‐use strategies.We set up a pot experiment with communities containing four species, assembled from a pool of 20 mesotrophic grassland species growing along a soil P gradient. Species selection included various growth forms (grasses vs forbs) and resource‐use strategies (acquisitive vs conservative resource use). We measured three variables characterizing the (a)biotic environmental context: bioavailable soil P concentration, total community biomass as a proxy for the intensity of competition, and the proportional biomass of a species in the community as a proxy for its competitive dominance. We investigated the effect of this environmental context on the expression of two leaf traits, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC).We found an acquisitive trait expression within species (increase in SLA and decrease in LDMC) in response to increased soil P supply and a conservative trait expression (decrease in SLA and increase in LDMC) in response to an increase in total community biomass. Importantly, the trait responses to the environmental context were generally consistent for species representing very different resource‐use strategies and growth forms.Species responded with a shift from an acquisitive to a conservative trait expression in response to limited resources; i.e., driven by a decrease in soil phosphorus concentration or an increase in total community biomass. Unexpectedly, the intraspecific variability in response to the changing environmental conditions was not clearly mediated by the species’ strategy. These findings show that plant ecological strategies are probably not the main driver for intraspecific trait variability in an experimental grassland community.",d8e3c0d5c7ba1d8dbdc4cb2115efe8911b506679,,
10.1111/1365-2656.13845,Breaking down the components of the competition-colonization trade-off: new insights into its role in diverse systems.,"Performance trade-offs between competition and colonization can be an important mechanism facilitating regional coexistence of competitors. However, empirical evidence for this trade-off is mixed, raising questions about the extent to which it shapes diverse ecological communities. Here we outline a framework that can be used to improve empirical tests of the competition-colonization trade-off. We argue that tests of the competition-colonization trade-off have been diverted into unproductive paths when dispersal mode and/or competition type have been inadequately defined. To generate comparative predictions of associations between dispersal and competitive performance, we develop a conceptual trait-based framework that clarifies how dispersal mode and type of competitor shape this trade-off at the stage of dispersal and establishment in a variety of systems. Our framework suggests that competition-colonization trade-offs may be less common for passively dispersing organisms when competitive dominants are those best able to withstand resource depletion (competitive response), and for active dispersers when traits for dispersal performance are positively associated with resource pre-emption (competitive effect). The framework presented here is designed to provide common ground for researchers working in different systems in order to prompt more effective assessment of this performance trade-off and its role in shaping community structure. By delineating key system properties that mediate the trade-off between competitive and colonization performance and their relationship to individual-level traits, researchers in disparate systems can structure their predictions about this trade-off more effectively and compare across systems more clearly.",df3f179616fd405d7dd7f7758bec040eb7c1e49d,,
10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01125.x,Evolution of virulence: triggering host inflammation allows invading pathogens to exclude competitors,"Virulence is generally considered to benefit parasites by enhancing resource-transfer from host to pathogen. Here, we offer an alternative framework where virulent immune-provoking behaviours and enhanced immune resistance are joint tactics of invading pathogens to eliminate resident competitors (transferring resources from resident to invading pathogen). The pathogen wins by creating a novel immunological challenge to which it is already adapted. We analyse a general ecological model of ‘proactive invasion’ where invaders not adapted to a local environment can succeed by changing it to one where they are better adapted than residents. However, the two-trait nature of the ‘proactive’ strategy (provocation of, and adaptation to environmental change) presents an evolutionary conundrum, as neither trait alone is favoured in a homogenous host population. We show that this conundrum can be resolved by allowing for host heterogeneity. We relate our model to emerging empirical findings on immunological mediation of parasite competition.",e34b6aa506a2b708acd53876f38f7358e45fa6ab,,
10.1002/ecy.2904,Disturbance size and frequency mediate the coexistence of benthic spatial competitors.,"Disturbance plays a key role in structuring community dynamics and is central to conservation and natural resource management. However, ecologists continue to debate the importance of disturbance for species coexistence and biodiversity. Such disagreements may arise in part because few studies have examined variation across multiple dimensions of disturbance (e.g., size, frequency) and how the effects of disturbance may depend on species attributes (e.g., competitiveness, dispersal ability). In light of this gap in understanding and accelerating changes to disturbance regimes worldwide, we used spatial population models to explore how disturbance size and frequency interact with species attributes to affect coexistence between seagrass (Zostera marina) and colonial burrowing shrimp (Neotrypaea californiensis) that compete for benthic space in estuaries throughout the west coast of North America. By simulating population dynamics under a range of ecologically-relevant disturbance regimes, we discovered that intermediate disturbance (approximately 9-23% of landscape area per year) to short-dispersing, competitively-dominant seagrass can foster long-term stable coexistence with broad-dispersing, competitively-inferior burrowing shrimp via the spatial storage effect. When holding the total extent of disturbance constant, the individual size and annual frequency of disturbance altered landscape spatial patterns and mediated the dominance and evenness of competitors. Many small disturbances favored short-dispersing seagrass by hastening recolonization, whereas fewer large disturbances benefitted rapidly-colonizing burrowing shrimp by creating temporary refugia from competition. As a result, large, infrequent disturbances generally improved the strength and stability of coexistence relative to small, frequent disturbances. Regardless of disturbance size or frequency, the dispersal ability of the superior competitor (seagrass), the competitive ability the inferior competitor (burrowing shrimp), and the reproduction and survival of both species strongly influenced population abundances and coexistence. Our results show that disturbance size and frequency can promote or constrain coexistence by altering the duration of time over which inferior competitors can escape competitive exclusion, particularly when colonization depends on the spatial pattern of disturbance due to dispersal traits. For coastal managers and conservation practitioners, our findings indicate that reducing particularly large disturbances may help conserve globally-imperiled seagrass meadows and control burrowing shrimp colonies that can threaten the viability of oyster aquaculture.",e7d0fd3c13b253fd4ccede50698faf6505e2505a,,
10.1111/1365-2656.13028,Host traits and competitive ability jointly structure disease dynamics and community assembly.,"Parasitism and competition are both ubiquitous interactions in ecological communities. The ability of host species to interact directly via competition and indirectly through shared parasites suggests that host traits related to competition and parasitism are likely important in structuring communities and disease dynamics. Specifically, those host traits affecting competition and those mediating parasitism are often correlated either because of trade-offs (in resource acquisition or resource allocation) or condition dependence, yet the consequences of these trait relationships for community and epidemiological dynamics are poorly understood. We conducted a literature review of parasite-related host traits-competitive ability relationships. We found that transmission-competitive ability relationships were most often reported, and that superior competitors exhibited elevated transmission relative to their less-competitive counterparts in nearly 80% of the cases. We also found a significant number of virulence-competitive ability and parasite shedding-competitive ability relationships. We investigated these links by altering the relationship between host competitive ability and three parasite-related traits (transmission, virulence and parasite shedding rates) in a simple model, incorporating competitive asymmetries in a multi-host community. We show that these relationships can lead to a range of different communities. For example, depending on the strength and direction of these distinct trait relationships, we observed communities with anywhere from high parasite prevalence to complete parasite extinction, and either one, two or the maximum of three host species coexisting. Our results suggest that parasite-competitive ability relationships may be common in nature, that further integration of these relationships can produce novel and unexpected community and disease dynamics, and that generalizations may allow for the prediction of how parasitism and competition jointly structure disease and diversity in natural communities.",f0df51d9c947b2b8f3e6a5884bcf8c83ab27ce61,,
10.1002/ecy.70039,Coexistence of coinvading species with mutualism and competition,"Abstract All interactions between multiple species invading together (coinvasion) must be accounted for to predict species coexistence patterns across space. Mutualisms, particularly, are known to influence species' population dynamics and their invasive ability (e.g., mycorrhizal fungi with partner plants). Yet, while modeling coinvasion, their role in mediating coexistence is overlooked. Here, we build a spatially explicit model of coinvasion of two competing plant species with a shared fungal mutualist to study how mutualism and competition interact to shape the local and regional coexistence of competitors. We observe four main results. First, mutualist presence generates regional coexistence between competitors even when local coexistence between them is impossible. Second, increasing partner mutualist dispersal leads to abrupt changes in competitor coexistence outcomes. Third, differences in mutualist partner dependence and competitive ability interact to produce a variety of local and regional coexistence outcomes. Fourth, asymmetry in the dispersal ability arising from dependence‐dispersal trade‐offs leads to greater exclusion of species less dependent on mutualist partners for growth. In toto, incorporating mutualism‐specific trait trade‐offs and dispersal asymmetries into coinvasion models offers new insights into regional coexistence and invasive species distributions.",f14b0dd3d54eded3b876083986fa574080bdb6e9,,
