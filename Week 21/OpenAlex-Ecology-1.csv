Yet there is considerable debate about their nature, strength and overall importance. This debate stems in part from continued uncertainty about the ultimate mechanisms driving cascading effects. We present a synthesis of empirical evidence in support of one possible ultimate mechanism: the foraging‐predation risk trade‐offs undertaken by intermediary species. We show that simple trade‐off behaviour can lead to both positive and negative indirect effects of predators on plant resources and hence can explain considerable contingency on the nature and strength of cascading effects among systems. Thus, predicting the sign and strength of indirect effect simply requires knowledge of habitat and resource use by prey with regard to predators’ presence, habitat use and hunting mode. The synthesis allows us to postulate a hypothesis for new conceptualization of trophic cascades which is to be viewed as an ultimate trade‐off between intervening species. In this context, different predators apply different rules of engagement based on their hunting mode and habitat use. These different rules then determine whether behavioural effects persist or attenuate at the level of the food chain.",W2124528330,True,0.9890607595443726
https://doi.org/10.1890/04-1249,RESOURCE COMPETITION MODIFIES THE STRENGTH OF TRAIT-MEDIATED PREDATOR–PREY INTERACTIONS: A META-ANALYSIS,"Only a fraction of the individuals in a given prey population are likely to be killed and consumed by predators. In contrast, nearly all individuals experience the chronic effects of predation risk. When threatened by predators, prey adopt defensive tactics whose costs can lead to reduced growth, maturation rates, survivorship, fecundity, or population density. This nonconsumptive impact of predation risk on prey is known as a ""trait-mediated interaction"" (TMI) because it results from changes in prey traits such as behavior or physiology. Ecological theory suggests that the strength of TMI effects will reflect a balance between the conflicting demands of reproduction vs. predator avoidance. Competitor density and resource availability are expected to alter the balance between these conflicting forces. We conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured TMI effect size while varying competitor and/or resource density. The threat of predation had an overall negative effect on prey performance, but the strength of this effect varied with the level of competition. High competition exacerbated the negative effect of intimidation on prey density but moderated the negative effect of intimidation on prey life history and growth. We discuss these results in light of previously published theoretical expectations. Our results highlight the variable and context-dependent nature of interspecific interactions.",W2044321783,True,0.9932403564453125

To date, this work has primarily focused on the effects of predator-induced behavioral plasticity on communities. However, predator-induced morphological plasticity, which has been documented in many taxa, might also lead to trait-mediated indirect effects. Here, I examined how predators altered the behavior and morphology of larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and leopard frogs (R. pipiens) and how these phenotypic changes altered the outcome of competition between the two species. Competition in the absence of caged predators was asymmetric; when reared separately, leopard frogs grew more than wood frogs, but when competing (without predators), wood frogs grew faster than leopard frogs. The presence of caged predators reversed the outcome of competition between the two anuran prey. In the presence of larval dragonflies (Anax spp.) or caged mudminnows (Umbra limi), leopard frogs grew faster than wood frogs while total tadpole biomass production remained unchanged. Thus, there was a predator-mediated indirect effect. Because predators alter both the behavior and morphology of larval anurans and both of these traits are known to affect resource consumption and growth, both are potential mechanisms to explain the change in competitive outcome. Changes in behavior were not related to changes in growth, but changes in morphology (specifically mouth width and tail length) were related to changes in growth. When competitors were added (without predators), wood frogs increased their mouth width by 10% and their tail length by 3%, while leopard frogs increased their mouth width by 5% and did not change their tail length. The greater increase in mouth width for wood frogs should increase their forage intake, since tadpoles feed by scraping periphyton; the importance of a 3% longer tail in competitive ability is unknown. The presence of the predator threat (via chemical cues from the caged predators) reduced both the mouth width and tail length in the two prey species to pre-competition levels. This response corresponded with the reduced competitive ability of the wood frogs. This work demonstrates that both competitors and predators can alter prey morphology and suggests that changes in morphology can cause trait-mediated indirect effects.",W2134929066,True,0.9956339001655579

Furthermore, since most biological communities are not simple food chains but complex networks of interactions, one TMII within a community might easily be influenced by another TMII. In other words, TMII themselves can be cascades with potential implications for community dynamics. Here we report on one of such cascade, where a parasitic fly induces behavioral changes that disrupt a trait-mediated ant–hemipteran mutualism. We show that during parasite-induced low-activity periods, the ant Azteca instabilis fails to protect its mutualistic scale-insect partner against predatory ladybeetles. Thus, in the presence of the parasite, ladybeetles ate as many scales in ant-patrolled plants as they did in ant-free plants. These results demonstrate how, through a cascade of trait-mediated interactions, associations between members of a community can be drastically altered.",W2162163837,True,0.9337142109870911
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-9563.2008.00427.x,"Trophic promiscuity, intraguild predation and the problem of omnivores","Does anybody else miss the good old days of trophic levels? When predators, herbivores and plants knew their place and interacted in appropriate linear chains (Hairston et al., 1960; Oksanen, 1981)? We released biological control agents under the optimistic assumption that they would attack their designated prey, more or less, and at least leave organisms at other trophic levels well alone. We built management programmes and mathematical models based on this assumption (Berryman, 1992). We lived in simpler times. No longer. Omnivores, apparently, are everywhere, practicing their trophic promiscuity in complex and dynamic fashion (Rosenheim, 2007). Predators eat predators, herbivores and, incorrigibly, sometimes plants (Coll & Guershon, 2002). Food chains have become passé, replaced by reticulate webs that defy our simple notions of stability as well as all sense of propriety (Polis et al., 1989; Holt & Polis, 1997). We are face to face with the uncomfortable reality that our agents of control often eat more broadly than we would like them to. We live in the days of the omnivores. Ecologists who work in unmanaged systems have long been acquainted with the vexing issue of omnivory. Random food webs built on Lotka–Volterra predator–prey equations become less stable with omnivory (Pimm, 1982), unless the omnivorous compartments (or loops) within the webs are characterized by weak links (Neutel et al., 2007) or nonlinearities (McCann & Hastings, 1997). In other words, omnivory should be either rare or weak for systems to persist. Yet omnivory is apparently ubiquitous (Denno & Fagan, 2003; Arim & Marquet, 2004) and, judging by a casual glance at the ants alone, the links are hardly trivial (Davidson et al., 2003; Helms & Vinson, 2008; Ottonetti et al., 2008). For entomologists who work in managed systems, questions of omnivory are taking centre stage in research on agents of biological control. The compatibility of multiple control agents, interactions between native and introduced predators, damage to crops and the spread of crop pathogens are all influenced by the degree to which insects practice omnivory. We have always worried, to some degree, about nontarget effects of biological control agents, but concerns most often were for species at the same trophic level as the target of our control efforts (Simberloff & Stiling, 1996; Hawkins & Marino, 1997; Louda & Stiling, 2004; Stiling, 2004). More and more, we recognize that nontarget effects of biological control agents can emerge at multiple trophic levels (Rosenheim et al., 1995; Rosenheim, 1998) with the potential to compromise control efforts and influence associated ecosystems. High rates of omnivory may be responsible in part for the spread of exotic invasive predators and the decline of their native counterparts (Snyder et al., 2004b), with successful invaders being those species with adaptations to counter the ravages of omnivorous predators (Sato & Dixon, 2004). I have been thinking about this recently, in part because of the loss of our friend, colleague, and champion of omnivory research, Robert F. (Bob) Denno, who died last year. Others are more qualified to describe the profound and lasting influence that Bob had on the field of entomology. One of his interests in recent years was the study of omnivory, and his group helped to stimulate cutting-edge research on omnivores in natural and managed systems. This paper is not a tribute to Bob's research. Rather, his passing prompted me to think about the advances in omnivore research made during the last 5 years or so (I cheat with reference to a few important papers of finer vintage), and I present some highlights here with particular reference to managed systems. Omnivores are organisms that feed on more than one trophic level (Pimm & Lawton, 1978). Omnivores therefore include 'herbivores' that engage in cannibalism, 'predators' that suck plant juices or consume seeds or pollen and 'predators' that feed on other predators as well as herbivores (Coll & Guershon, 2002; Denno & Fagan, 2003). Most of us are familiar with ants as prototypical omnivores. Many ant species will consume animal tissue, plant exudates, phloem, seeds (or their elaiosomes) and honeydew produced by herbivorous insects (Carroll & Janzen, 1973). At least for some ant species, omnivory is not simply a response to low resource availability. For example, colonies of the invasive red imported fire ant Solenopsis invicta in the southern U.S.A. grow 50% larger in the presence of honeydew-producing insects than they do when provided with unlimited access to insect prey (Helms & Vinson, 2008). Given that honeydew is generally thought to be a lower-quality resource than animal tissue (Speight et al., 2008), there must be something about resource diversity that is important to fire ants. A subset of omnivores, known as intraguild predators (Polis et al., 1989), feed on prey items and the prey of their prey (Fig. 1). As a result, intraguild (IG) predators both eat IG prey and compete with them for resources. Intraguild predation (IGP) appears to be astonishingly common in nature, with 58–87% of species engaged in IGP interactions in the 113 food webs analysed by Arim and Marquet (2004). This is a staggering proportion of species, and a clear challenge to the notion of discrete trophic levels. According to a wide variety of models of intraguild predation (IGP), coexistence (stability) is possible only when the IG prey is a stronger competitor than the IG predator for the shared resource and only at intermediate levels of resource productivity (Holt & Polis, 1997; Borer et al., 2007). At low resource productivity, the IG predator is excluded, whereas, at high resource productivity, the IG prey is excluded. Given the apparent prevalence of IGP in nature over wide ranges of resource productivity, there must be additional coexistence mechanisms that act to stabilize IGP interactions. These might include cannibalism among predators (Rudolf, 2007), spatial or temporal refuges for the participants (Amarasekare, 2007; Janssen et al., 2007), additional density-dependent processes operating on species (Ives et al., 2005) or additional prey available to the consumers (Briggs & Borer, 2005; Holt & Huxel, 2007). A simple illustration of intraguild predation where the intraguild predator consumes the intraguild prey when competing with it for the crop pest. Pest suppression can be compromised, thus reducing crop yields. If all of the above sounds a bit abstract, consider an example. The harlequin bug Murgantia histrionica is a specialist herbivore on bladderpod Isomeris arborea in California. The eggs of the harlequin bug are parasitized by two specialist parasitoids, Trissolcus murgantiae and Ooencyrtus johnsonii (Amarasekare, 2000). Because they overlap in resource use (harlequin bug eggs) and because O. johnsonii consumes T. murgantiae (but not vice versa) when they co-occur, the system is an example of IGP; O. johnsonii is the IG predator and T. murgantiae is the IG prey. All species coexist over a broad range of resource productivity (i.e. new bug eggs per unit time) and, in this case, the interaction is apparently stabilized by a temporal refuge for the IG prey. Trissolcus murgantiae is active at cooler temperatures and has an early-season time window during which it is free from competition with, and predation by, O. johnsonii (Amarasekare, 2007). I mentioned earlier that omnivory is apparently much more common than we once thought. Why should omnivory be common in nature? Omnivores are an interesting form of dietary generalists, extending their dietary breadth beyond their own trophic level to encompass prey items at additional trophic levels. A generalist diet is considered by some to evolve in response to a trade-off between dietary quality and dietary quantity, and this same logic has been applied to the evolution of insect omnivores (Denno & Fagan, 2003). For example, if the highest-quality food source for an organism is also the most abundant, there should be no selection pressure (or ecological benefit) for a generalist diet and specialization should result (Krebs & Davies, 1993). As described in some ancient religious texts, there are no omnivores in a world awash in manna. However, as the highest-quality food source becomes increasingly diluted by more common, lower quality food, dietary breadth should increase. Denno and Fagan (2003) have suggested that omnivorous predators are supplementing their diet of low-nitrogen herbivores with higher-nitrogen predators. Omnivory, then, is seen as a strategy by which herbivore-eaters improve their lot. A complementary view might be that higher-order predators are required to incorporate lower quality herbivores into their diet because other predators are too rare as sources of food. In other words, the relative scarcity of prey with high concentrations of nitrogen in their body tissues (i.e. other arthropod predators) should result in the incorporation of herbivores (intermediate nitrogen concentrations) and plants (low nitrogen concentrations) into the diet of some predators. Omnivory is therefore favoured by the relative scarcity of food items that are good stoichiometric matches to the consumer. Of course, the evolution of omnivory is not just about stoichiometry (Matsumura et al., 2004). Diet mixing in general can dilute toxins in food, reduce the risk of predation or parasitism, and increase resistance to natural enemies (Singer & Bernays, 2003). There are evolutionary challenges to omnivory because omnivores must be able to catch, handle, digest and assimilate a broader range of prey types than their trophically-conservative relatives. We might therefore expect to see phylogenetic patterns in the evolution of omnivory and, indeed, we do. For example, within ancestrally herbivorous and ancestrally predaceous lineages of terrestrial heteropterans, seed and pollen feeding and broad host ranges are both correlated with the evolution of omnivory (Eubanks et al., 2003). In other words, existing morphological and physiological traits can pre-adapt certain groups to an omnivorous lifestyle (Coll & Guershon, 2002). Our efforts at biological control are often conceived under the assumption of simple food chains. They reflect our desire to manage trophic cascades (Paine, 1980; Carpenter et al., 1985), whereby the abundance of top predators (agents of control) determines the standing crop of primary producers (our crops of interest) (Hunter & Price, 1992; Hunter, 2001). Omnivory may dampen the effects of trophic cascades (Strong, 1992; McCann et al., 1998; Denno, 2007), reducing herbivore suppression by natural enemies and increasing plant damage (Finke & Denno, 2004, 2005). For those of us engaged in the control and management of insect pests, one question is obviously central: does the presence or introduction of multiple enemy species, including omnivores, increase or decrease pest suppression? In other words, how badly do intraguild predation and omnivory interfere with biological control? Quite often, the introduction of multiple agents of control results in the establishment of only a single dominant control agent (Denoth et al., 2002). However, when multiple control agents are naturally or artificially established, what are the consequences for pest suppression? First, consider simple models of IGP. We established above that IG predators and IG prey can sometimes coexist, through a variety of ecological mechanisms either intrinsic or extrinsic to their interactions. What does ecological theory tell us about the suppression of their shared prey: the pests of our production systems? As a reminder, we have to be careful to distinguish between pest 'production', which broadly describes the addition (birth, immigration) of new pest individuals per unit time, and the standing biomass of pests, which describes their average densities in the cropping system. Pest densities can be low, even if pest production is high, when rates of predation are also high. With that in mind, theory predicts that the IG predator should become relatively more abundant (and the IG prey relatively less abundant) as pest productivity increases (Holt & Polis, 1997). Moreover, pest density should also increase as the IG predator increases in dominance. This is exactly what occurs in the dynamics of the iconic California red scale, Aonidiella aurantii, which is parasitized by Aphytis melanus (IG predator) and Encarsia perniciosi (IG prey). As the productivity (i.e. fecundity) of red scale increases among sites, there is an increase in the relative density of the IG predator, A. melanus, and a corresponding increase in scale standing stock (density) (Borer et al., 2003). What that means for pest managers, of course, is a higher pest density as the IG predator comes to dominate the dynamics. Simply put, simple theory tells us that IGP should reduce the suppression of pests by biological control agents. However, empirical studies provide a greater range of outcomes than predicted by simple theory, and the literature includes examples of negative, neutral and positive interactions among predators that share prey resources. A recent meta-analysis has suggested that prey suppression is more often higher in diverse than in simple predator communities (Cardinale et al., 2006), although issues of omnivory were not examined directly. In a second meta-analysis focused more specifically on omnivory, mutual IGP (when predator species can consume each other) was shown to compromise pest suppression in multi-predator systems, whereas unidirectional IGP (or the absence of IGP) did not (Vance-Chalcraft et al., 2007). In other words, the strength and form of IGP in diverse predator communities appears to determine subsequent effects on pest suppression. As a gentle reminder, meta-analyses are usually aggregates of studies that report both significant positive and negative effects; the negative reports do not cease to be valid in their own right just because they are less common on average than the positive ones. Perhaps the more interesting question is why the effects of multi-predator species on pest suppression appear to be context dependent (Straub & Snyder, 2008). We are making major progress in answering this question, in part because theory on interactions among predator species is being linked to theory on relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem processes (Ives et al., 2005). We have learnt from these efforts that there exist at least four mechanisms by which predator diversity influences pest suppression. These are: (i) sampling (or lottery) effects (the presence or absence of dominant predators); (ii) resource partitioning among predators; (iii) indirect effects caused by intraguild predation; and (iv) non-additive effects among predators (Ives et al., 2005). This is a critical observation because it allows us to reconcile studies in which increasing predator diversity is associated with either higher or lower levels of pest suppression. The relative importance of the four mechanisms described above in a particular production system of interest will probably determine whether high predator diversity increases or decreases crop yield. For example, we might expect that multiple predators with strong additive or synergistic effects will increase pest suppression and increase crop yields, whereas multiple predators engaged in high levels of intraguild predation should decrease pest suppression and crop yield (Rosenheim, 1998; Sih et al., 1998; Snyder & Ives, 2003). The study by Ives et al. (2005) provides a roadmap for future research on the effects of multi-predator species on pest suppression because a series of predictions is made that should be testable in production systems. For example, their analyses suggest that the sampling effect will tend to cause a reduction in pest densities as predator diversity increases, so long as predators vary in their assimilation efficiencies or capture rates. Likewise, resource partitioning by predators among multiple species of prey will also tend to cause reductions in the average pest burden on plants as predator density increases. The latter effect of resource partitioning raises an important point: the predicted effects of predator–predator interactions on pest suppression depend upon the number of pest species within the production system. For example, if there is only one pest in the cropping system, or one that is dramatically more important to yield than all others, then IGP will probably lead to higher levels of crop damage. However, models also show that, in speciose pest communities, the total density of the entire herbivore community should still decline with increasing predator diversity when IGP is operating (Ives et al., 2005). This suggests that crops with diverse pest species may suffer less overall damage with diverse predator populations, even when those predators engage in IGP. In brief, the overall impact of IGP on pest suppression depends in part on the diversity of pests in the cropping system. It appears that any negative impacts of IGP on pest suppression may be weak in comparison to the positive effects of predator diversity in multipest systems. The apparent ubiquity of omnivory and intraguild predation (Arim & Marquet, 2004) has prompted much recent empirical work, aimed at untangling the effects of predator–predator interactions on herbivore suppression. In a series of clever experiments, Finke and Denno (2005) measured independently the effects of predator diversity and intraguild predation on herbivores and plants in a salt marsh ecosystem. They demonstrated that increasing predator diversity had little impact on herbivores and plants unless the predators engaged in intraguild predation. Under those circumstances, herbivore suppression declined and plant biomass was concomitantly reduced. Generalizing, multi-predator species appeared to be detrimental to plants when they engaged in intraguild predation. Yet some notorious IG predators can apparently participate in successful biological control. In experimental studies of pea aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum on alfalfa in the Midwestern U.S.A., suppression of pea aphids is higher (with corresponding higher alfalfa yields) with higher diversity of natural enemies (Cardinale et al., 2003). In this interesting case, the presence of generalist predators (Harmonia axyridis and Nabis sp.) causes declines in the associated cowpea aphid Aphis craccivora with the result that a key parasitoid, Aphidius ervi, focuses its prodigious powers of parasitism on pea aphids. The result is greater (non-additive) suppression of pea aphids than would be predicted from the sum of the effects of each enemy in isolation. Pest suppression occurs despite the fact that both Harmonia and Nabis are well-known omnivores, attacking other predators as well as herbivores (Snyder & Ives, 2003). What I particularly like about this study is that it includes measurements of crop yield, providing compelling evidence that growers should benefit from the presence of a diverse predator community. It also illustrates that positive indirect effects of high predator diversity can overcome simultaneous negative effects of IGP, as suggested by Ives et al. (2005). Similarly, a diverse predator assemblage can result in suppression of aphid pests, and higher crop yields, in collards Brassica oleracea (Snyder et al., 2006). In the U.S.A., collards are attacked by the green peach aphid Myzus persicae and the cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicae. In turn, these aphids are attacked by a diverse predator assemblage, including the predatory bugs Geocoris pallens and Nabis spp., the ladybird beetles Coccinella septempunctata and Hippodamia convergens, and the parasitoid wasp Diaeretiella rapae. All of these predators are actually omnivores, engaging in IGP. As a result, IGP has the potential to interfere with pest suppression and increase levels of crop damage. Nonetheless, any negative effects of IGP on pest suppression are swamped by positive effects of predator complementarity, which keep aphid numbers low and increase collard production (Snyder et al., 2006). Similar results were recently reported for potato (Straub & Snyder, 2008). Glasshouse production systems may also benefit from multi-predator introductions, even in the presence of IGP. In the U.S.A., the aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae is a significant pest of greenhouse-grown roses. It is attacked by the parasitoid Aphelinus asychis, which can also establish in greenhouses. It appears that simultaneous introduction of the parasitoid and the coccinellid beetle H. axyridis has no deleterious impact on aphid suppression by the parasitoid (Snyder et al., 2004a). Rather, control is complementary, despite the fact that the beetle consumes mummified aphids that contain parasitoid pupae (intraguild predation). Biological control is improved in the presence of the beetle because it prefers to consume unparasitized, rather than parasitized, aphids. What actions can pest managers take to reduce the probability that IGP will interfere with pest suppression under multi-predator biological control? One possibility might be to increase the heterogeneity of the cropping system. Evidence is accumulating that high habitat heterogeneity can ameliorate the negative effects of IGP on prey suppression. Structured habitats appear to provide refuges for IG prey from their IG predators, favouring the coexistence of multiple predator species (Finke & Denno, 2006; Janssen et al., 2007). For example, in salt marsh ecosystems, spiders and mirid bugs combine to attack populations of Prokelisia planthoppers on Spartina. In the presence of abundant leaf litter (thatch), predators have refuges from IGP, with the result that plant hopper populations decline and plant biomass increases (Finke & Denno, 2006). In the absence of thatch, IGP prevents the trophic cascade from operating, and planthoppers cause declines in plant biomass. In the same system, habitat heterogeneity can also act to reduce rates of cannibalism among predators, a particularly unpleasant yet widespread form of intraguild predation (Langellotto & Denno, 2006). Although habitat heterogeneity does not always result in short-term pest suppression, (Langellotto & Denno, 2004; Janssen et al., 2007)), long-term persistence of a diverse enemy pool may facilitate long-term suppression of pest populations as environments vary over time. A tentative conclusion from the discussion above might be that omnivorous predators can still promote pest suppression and higher crop yields, at least in systems with multiple pest species and high habitat heterogeneity. However, what if those predators also eat plants? Is there a place for crop-eating predators in biological control? Of course, there is a long evolutionary history of mutualism between plants and predators by which plants provide food or shelter for predators in return for predation services (Speight et al., 2008). We might therefore expect that the benefits to plants of supporting plant-feeding predators should often outweigh the costs. It turns out that many predators and parasitoids will consume plant material and still contribute to pest suppression. Zoophytophagy, the habit of consuming plant and animal tissue, is common in agroecosystems among the Heteroptera, Neuroptera, Thysanoptera, Phytoseiidae (Acarina) and Coccinellidae (Coleoptera) (Robinson et al., 2008). Zoophytophagy can be beneficial to biological control, despite plant damage, if it maintains predator populations during periods of low prey abundance (Coll & Guershon, 2002). However, if the crop plants are chemically treated or genetically transformed, plant-feeding has the potential to reduce predator populations (Moser et al., 2008). Zoophytophagous bugs in the family Heteroptera are notorious omnivores, feeding on both plant tissue and insect prey. Indeed, the availability of suitable plant species for oviposition and feeding may increase Heteropteran performance and their subsequent efficacy as agents of control (Lundgren et al., 2008). Typically, however, plants are assumed to be low-quality resources for zoophytophages, exploited largely when animal prey is at low abundance. For example, Nesidiocoris tenuis (Heteroptera: Miridae) is a zoophytophage on whitefly and tomatoes in greenhouse production systems. The occurrence of plant feeding by N. tenuis increases as its own density increases and decreases as whitefly prey become more abundant (Sanchez, 2008). Rapid decreases in N. tenuis populations after whitefly declines demonstrate that plants are poorer nutrient sources for predators than are whitefly prey. The benefits to omnivorous predators of plant-feeding may vary from simple water uptake in some systems to significant nutrient and energy gain in others (Robinson et al., 2008; Sanchez, 2008). For example, the coccinellid beetle Coleomegilla maculata is an important biological control agent of corn pests in the U.S.A. It feeds on corn pollen during larval and adult stages, with adult pollen consumption exceeding a prodigious 13 mg per beetle (Lundgren et al., 2005). Given such high potential consumption of plant resources by omnivores (Wackers et al., 2008), it should be no surprise that there are commercially available 'nutrient supplements' for use with biological control agents. However, it is important to note that their value in pest suppression is not well established (Wade et al., 2008). Whether there is a net positive or negative effect of zoophytophagy on pest suppression may depend upon environmental conditions, including pest density and the period over which pest dynamics are measured. For example, adult lacewings consume floral resources (nectar, pollen) as well as aphid prey on buckwheat in New Zealand (Robinson et al., 2008). In the presence of buckwheat flowers, lacewings consume fewer aphids each day, with an apparently negative effect of omnivory on pest suppression. However, at lower aphid densities, a propensity for flower-feeding reduces the pre-oviposition period of lacewing adults, increasing their oviposition rates (i.e. a long-term positive effect on pest suppression at the population level). This is a key point: short-term experiments tend to illustrate potential negative impacts of omnivory and IGP on pest suppression that may be more than compensated for by long-term benefits under field conditions (Ives et al., 2005; Robinson et al., 2008). As a final thought on zoophytophagy, plants engineered to express toxins might be expected to have negative impacts upon omnivorous predators, and such effects have been documented over the years subsequent to the deployment of transgenic plants. However, most effects appear to be weak. For example, the coccinellid C. maculata, and the invasive coccinellid Harmonia axyridis will feed on corn leaf tissue, even when aphid prey and water are in abundant supply (Moser et al., 2008). Given that most corn in the U.S.A. is now transformed to express Bt toxins, coccinellids might suffer from feeding on transgenic corn. Rates of larval development in C. maculata appear to decline slightly when fed on Bt corn seedlings, but the effect is not particularly strong (Moser et al., 2008). With some exceptions, then, omnivores still appear to be our friends. They add diversity to the predator pool that is available to suppress the pests of our production systems. Their pathways of consumption may be reticulate and their interactions indirect, but they can often contribute to biological control in important ways. To maximize the benefits and minimize the risks associated with using omnivores in biological control, there are several lines of future work that would be beneficial. I have already mentioned the important predictions provided by the theoretical work of Ives et al. (2005) that need to be tested. Additionally, stable isotope analyses are providing more detailed descriptions of the relative consumption by omnivores of different food sources. For example, in Tuscan olive orchards, 13C signatures demonstrate that ants gain energy from both olive-based and herb-based food webs. In the same system, different ant species vary in their use of plant-based and animal-based resources, as illustrated by their 15N signatures (Ottonetti et al., 2008). Such studies provide vital information on the energy pathways used by omnivores in production systems and appear to support the important role of habitat heterogeneity in mediating the positive impacts of omnivores in pest suppression. Moreover, as Bob Denno would have pointed out, we need to consider in much more detail how the behaviours and life histories of predators and prey influence the strength and direction of interactions in omnivorous food webs (Denno et al., 2003; Rosenheim & Corbett, 2003; Singer & Bernays, 2003). We should also continue to explore effects of omnivory on pest suppression that appear influenced by ecological contingency, particularly variation caused by seasonality, habitat structure and nutrient availability (Gratton & Denno, 2003; Denno et al., 2005). Omnivores may complicate our traditional naïve views of pest management, but there is no denying that they make life more interesting.",W2099415115,True,0.9725580215454102

Leaf pubescence has been repeatedly shown to mediate predator‐herbivore interactions whereas the influence of leaf pubescence on predator–predator interactions such as intraguild predation (IGP) has seldom been investigated. Using a three‐pronged approach we assessed the influence of leaf pubescence on the predatory mites Kampimodromus aberrans and Euseius finlandicus. Both predators occur on broad‐leaved trees in Europe. Euseius finlandicus is mostly found on trees with glabrous leaves whereas K. aberrans mainly occurs on trees with pubescent leaves. We hypothesized that leaf pubescence mediates IGP between K. aberrans and E. finlandicus and thereby determines their dominance and proportional abundance. A field survey on apple revealed that the abundance of K. aberrans and E. finlandicus is negatively correlated, with the former predominating on cultivars with strongly pubescent leaves and the latter predominating on cultivars with little pubescent or glabrous leaves. Microhabitat choice tests showed that K. aberrans preferentially resides on pubescent leaves whereas E. finlandicus preferentially resides on glabrous leaves. The effects of leaf pubescence on survival and development of immature IG predators and IG prey were reversed for K. aberrans and E. finlandicus. In the presence of the IG predator E. finlandicus, immature K. aberrans had higher survival probabilities on pubescent leaves than on glabrous ones. In contrast, the survival chances of immature E. finlandicus were higher on glabrous leaves than on pubescent ones when the IG predator K. aberrans was present. Artificial leaf pubescence enhanced IG prey capture by immature K. aberrans and prolonged their longevity but impaired IG prey capture by immature E. finlandicus and shortened their longevity. We conclude that leaf pubescence mediates IGP strength and symmetry and discuss the implications to natural and biological control.",W2021103581,True,0.9730757474899292
https://doi.org/10.1111/jzo.12127,Trait‐mediated effects between predators: ant chemical cues induce spider dispersal,"Abstract Predators can induce changes in prey phenotype such as dispersal, activity and foraging rate. Such trait‐mediated effects ( TME s) can strongly affect prey populations and generate trophic cascades, rivaling the importance of predation in communities. However, the relevance of TME on intraguild interactions has rarely been addressed. Ants and spiders are widespread generalist predators in terrestrial habitats. Ants influence arthropod assemblages and disrupt top‐down effects of spiders on herbivores by killing spiders and/or by inducing spider emigration. Here, we examined whether ants induce dispersal behaviour in spiders. We tested the effect of chemical cues of two ant species ( L asius niger, F ormica clara ) on the walking activity and the propensity for silk‐based dispersal of spiders. Silk‐based dispersal of the web‐builder P hylloneta impressa increased by 80% with exposure to L asius cues, whereas dispersal of the hunting spider X ysticus more than doubled when confronted with cues of both L asius and F ormica. In addition, X ysticus individuals showed a marked increase in walking activity when exposed to F ormica but not L asius cues. Our results show for the first time that perceived predation risk influences spider dispersal. The strong effect of ant chemical cues on spider dispersal demonstrates that TME s contribute to the impact of ants on arthropod communities.",W1512314749,True,0.9655721783638
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1218,Herbivore density mediates the indirect effect of herbivores on plants via induced resistance and apparent competition,"Abstract Herbivore‐induced plant resistance and apparent competition are two indirect ways herbivores interact. If a less damaging herbivore indirectly suppresses the abundance of a more damaging herbivore via these mechanisms, then plants may ultimately benefit. Changes in herbivore density, however, can dictate the intensity of species interactions and may play a critical role in determining the outcome of plant‐ and predator‐mediated herbivore interactions. We tested the effects of herbivore density on the strength of indirect interactions among phloem‐feeding aphids and herbivorous caterpillars and the outcome of these interactions for their shared host plant, cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum ). We quantified the survival of caterpillars on host plants that were infested with varying densities of aphids in the presence and absence of predators (ladybeetles). We found that aphids induced defensive proteins in cotton plants and that caterpillar survival was negatively affected by induced resistance. Likewise, we found that the presence of aphids increased predation of caterpillars by ladybeetles, but that apparent competition between aphids and caterpillars was density dependent. Ladybeetles consumed relatively high numbers of small caterpillars at low to intermediate aphid densities, but essentially became aphid specialists at high aphid densities. Aphid induced defenses and apparent competition combined such that plant damage by caterpillars was lowest when predators were present at low aphid density (induced resistance + highest level of apparent competition). This suggests that herbivores can benefit plants, but the effect on host plants is mediated by herbivore density. Indirect herbivore‐plant mutualisms may increase plant quality, plant fitness, and yield of crop plants and these interactions need to be considered in ecologically based pest management plans. In addition, these interactions likely alter arthropod community structure and natural selection on anti‐herbivore defense traits in plants in natural systems.",W2291488578,True,0.9058406352996826
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12317,Density‐ and trait‐mediated effects of a parasite and a predator in a tri‐trophic food web,"Summary Despite growing interest in ecological consequences of parasitism in food webs, relatively little is known about effects of parasites on long‐term population dynamics of non‐host species or about whether such effects are density or trait mediated. We studied a tri‐trophic food chain comprised of (i) a bacterial basal resource ( S erratia fonticola ), (ii) an intermediate consumer ( P aramecium caudatum ), (iii) a top predator ( D idinium nasutum ) and (iv) a parasite of the intermediate consumer ( H olospora undulata ). A fully factorial experimental manipulation of predator and parasite presence/absence was combined with analyses of population dynamics, modelling and analyses of host ( P aramecium ) morphology and behaviour. Predation and parasitism each reduced the abundance of the intermediate consumer ( P aramecium ), and parasitism indirectly reduced the abundance of the basal resource ( S erratia ). However, in combination, predation and parasitism had non‐additive effects on the abundance of the intermediate consumer, as well as on that of the basal resource. In both cases, the negative effect of parasitism seemed to be effaced by predation. Infection of the intermediate consumer reduced predator abundance. Modelling and additional experimentation revealed that this was most likely due to parasite reduction of intermediate host abundance (a density‐mediated effect), as opposed to changes in predator functional or numerical response. Parasitism altered morphological and behavioural traits, by reducing host cell length and increasing the swimming speed of cells with moderate parasite loads. Additional tests showed no significant difference in D idinium feeding rate on infected and uninfected hosts, suggesting that the combination of these modifications does not affect host vulnerability to predation. However, estimated rates of encounter with S erratia based on these modifications were higher for infected Paramecium than for uninfected P aramecium. A mixture of density‐mediated and trait‐mediated indirect effects of parasitism on non‐host species creates rich and complex possibilities for effects of parasites in food webs that should be included in assessments of possible impacts of parasite eradication or introduction.",W2054928994,True,0.9832069873809814

It focuses on two well documented responses of consumers to predation risk: decrease in consumer activity and habitat switch. These behavioral effects are transmitted to resources and they cause similar indirect effects as those which are mediated by density changes in consumers. Two indirect interactions are studied in this article: trophic cascades, and apparent competition. Results for density only, trait only and combined density and trait mediated interactions are compared and discussed with respect to manipulation with predator density (top‐down manipulation) and resource environmental capacity (bottom‐up manipulation). The article shows that trait‐mediated effects on species equilibrial densities are similar to those of density‐mediated, but they are often highly non‐linear. Thus, they may have potential for even stronger impact on food webs than those which are density mediated.",W2107288913,True,0.9639219641685486
https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/380474,Trait-Mediated Indirect Effects of Phorid Flies on Ants,"This paper provides a synthesis of the ecological impact of phorid fly parasitoids on ants. We find the most important impact of phorids on ants to be trait-mediated effects. Phorids diminish the foraging activity of ants, frequently reducing the number and average size of foragers and reducing the amount of food retrieved by a colony. However, ants' coping mechanisms include changing foraging site and time. Phorids can also affect competition, especially through changes in the ability of the host to win in exploitative competition. Factors such as microclimate, resource size, and habitat complexity interact with phorids to change their effect on competition. By being highly specific and attacking ants high in the competitive hierarchy, phorids can alter the linear nature of the competitive transitivity, and by reducing the number of foragers, they can change the discovery-dominance tradeoff that is observed in some ant communities. Trait-mediated effects of phorids also cascade to other trophic levels. As an example, we discuss the trait-mediated cascade of phorids on the Azteca instabilis system in coffee. In this system, by reducing the foraging activity of A. instabilis, phorids reduce the direct and indirect biological control impact of the ant in the coffee agroecosystem.",W2008344466,True,0.9902246594429016
https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2016.2590,Moving beyond linear food chains: trait-mediated indirect interactions in a rocky intertidal food web,"In simple, linear food chains, top predators can have positive indirect effects on basal resources by causing changes in the traits (e.g. behaviour, feeding rates) of intermediate consumers. Although less is known about trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) in more complex food webs, it has been suggested that such complexity dampens trophic cascades. We examined TMIIs between a predatory crab ( Carcinus maenas ) and two ecologically important basal resources, fucoid algae ( Ascophyllum nodosum ) and barnacles ( Semibalanus balanoides ), which are consumed by herbivorous ( Littorina littorea ) and carnivorous ( Nucella lapillus ) snails, respectively. Because crab predation risk suppresses snail feeding rates, we hypothesized that crabs would also shape direct and indirect interactions among the multiple consumers and resources. We found that the magnitude of TMIIs between the crab and each resource depended on the suite of intermediate consumers present in the food web. Carnivorous snails ( Nucella ) transmitted TMIIs between crabs and barnacles. However, crab–algae TMIIs were transmitted by both herbivorous ( Littorina ) and carnivorous ( Nucella ) snails, and these TMIIs were additive. By causing Nucella to consume fewer barnacles, crab predation risk allowed fucoids that had settled on or between barnacles to remain in the community. Hence, positive interactions between barnacles and algae caused crab–algae TMIIs to be strongest when both consumers were present. Studies of TMIIs in more realistic, reticulate food webs will be necessary for a more complete understanding of how predation risk shapes community dynamics.",W2603614123,True,0.9819585680961609

Parasitic phorid flies limit competitive-dominant ant activity, potentially meditating competitive interactions between ant species, changing competitive hierarchies, or affecting ant communities. I considered interactions between phorids (Pseudacteon sp.), their ant host (Azteca instabilis F. Smith), and co-occurring ant species in coffee agro-ecosystems testing whether phorids (1) limit A. instabilis recruitment activity, (2) affect competitive interaction between ant species, and (3) are associated with other species' resource access and therefore have the potential to change competitive hierarchies. I monitored recruitment of A. instabilis and other ants to baits over 90 min on canopy trees with or without phorids. A. instabilis were one-half as abundant with phorids. Other species gained access to baits 12 times more often and were only able to take over baits when phorids were present. Furthermore, many more species (13 versus 2) gained access to resources when phorids were present. These results indicate that phorids mediate competitive interactions between ant species and may influence ant communities by affecting resource availability. Considering that phorids limit A. instabilis attacks on herbivores and that ant species differ in effects on arthropod communities, phorids may have strong community-level effects in coffee agro-ecosystems.",W2173084741,True,0.9862258434295654
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12413,Using plant functional traits to restore Hawaiian rainforest,"Ecosystem restoration efforts are carried out by a variety of individuals and organizations with an equally varied set of goals, priorities, resources and time-scales. Once restoration of a degraded landscape or community is recognized as necessary, choosing which species to include in a restoration programme can be a difficult and value-laden process (Fry, Power & Manning 2013; Jones 2013). Species choice in restoration is often carried out with limited ecological information, particularly in regard to species interactions, successional processes and resource-use patterns. Selecting species can be particularly problematic in systems where there is no available baseline data on historical communities, or when restoration to a historic state is not feasible for ecological, logistic or economic reasons. In such cases, it may be preferable to focus on restoring site 'functionality' rather than returning to a historic baseline composition. We present a method for species selection in restoration, based on the collection of plant functional trait data. Using this method, managers can develop species mixtures with desired properties, including expected predictions of interspecific interactions and potential changes in biotic and abiotic conditions. To illustrate this approach, we present a case study in Hawaiian lowland wet forests (HLWF) in which plant species for a restoration project were chosen based on their functional traits, in order to help land managers achieve their restoration goals while at the same time allowing researchers to better understand invasion resistance and ecosystem functioning. In our case, our choices led to the development of hybrid ecosystems including both native and introduced species. However, the approach that we present is not limited to novel or hybrid ecosystem creation, because the candidate species examined and functional traits measured are determined by the user. Whereas restoration usually implies a return to historic conditions, there is also growing attention to what some authors have called 'intervention ecology' (sensu Hobbs et al. 2011). This view emphasizes maintaining ecosystem services and functions (Hobbs et al. 2011). The contrast between these frameworks has been widely debated in the literature, and we do not intend to advocate the merit of one view over the other here. Rather, we present the logic behind a functional trait approach, describe why its use is feasible in a Hawaiian lowland forest and present a step-by-step approach to the method that can be applied to a wide variety of ecological systems. While we readily acknowledge that in our study system, we cannot return to a pre-human state, we still consider our approach 'restoration' in a broad sense. Functional trait theory holds that characteristics or traits of each species reflect their resource use and life-history trade-offs (Reich 2014). A body of evidence shows that plant traits vary continuously, in predictable ways, along resource availability gradients – suggesting that species' functional traits can be linked to ecosystem properties and to ecosystem services (Lavorel 2013). Many studies have suggested that a robust image of a species' functional profile can be obtained by considering traits related to resource acquisition (e.g. foliar nitrogen, leaf area), resource limitation (e.g. midday leaf water potential, δ13C-integrated water-use efficiency, leaf mass per area), reproductive investment (e.g. height, seed mass, dispersal type) and resource allocation patterns (e.g. leaf mass per area, specific root length, wood density) (Drenovsky & James 2010; Douma et al. 2012; Sonnier et al. 2012; Fry, Power & Manning 2013). For restoration, selecting species with certain functional trait values can influence species interactions (including competition) and ecosystem properties (Suding et al. 2008). For example, if creating a more fire-tolerant community is necessary, practitioners could select species that increase fine-fuel loads or species whose presence will favour succession from forest to grassland. Other considerations relevant to managers include importance to local wildlife, ability to serve as nurse logs, nitrogen-fixing properties, etc. The Hawaiian archipelago offers a unique setting for testing novel approaches to applied ecological questions. On one hand, Hawai'i is considered a model system for ecological research because of the combination of well-defined biotic and abiotic gradients with extreme examples of adaptive radiation (Vitousek 2004). On the other hand, like many isolated oceanic islands, the Hawaiian Islands have been extremely vulnerable to invasion and anthropogenic disturbance. The combination of simplicity and susceptibility presents a distinctive platform for conservation research. Hawaiian lowland wet forests in particular present serious challenges for restoration and conservation. This forest type only exists as remnant patches, is always populated by invasive plant and animal species, and occurs near human habitation, where non-native propagule pressure is likely to be high (Zimmerman et al. 2008). In such ecosystems, it is important to recognize that not all non-native species are equally problematic. For example, many Polynesian introductions in Hawai'i have persisted in the landscape for up to 1000 years without becoming invasive. In addition to being culturally important, many non-invasive, non-native species have functional trait values, which are not present in the native flora. Breadfruit and coconut are two species that fit both of these criteria: they are not classified as invasive, and they have large leaves and seeds, unlike most native plants. From a restoration perspective, we aimed to test the hypothesis that designing communities with greater diversity of functional trait expression will lead to more invasion-resistant communities (Funk et al. 2008; Drenovsky & James 2010). To do so, we examined the functional traits of species using multivariate analysis; the technique projects each species to a specific x,y location in 'trait space,' which should reflect that species' functional profile. Our restoration experiment was carried out at the Keaukaha Military Reservation (KMR) within the municipality of Hilo. This site retains a HLWF, which has a canopy that contains significant numbers of native tree species; however, it also has a long history of disturbance, and invasive trees represent up to half of the basal area (Ostertag et al. 2009). A previous removal experiment in this forest has shown that removal of invasive species alone is not enough to get a native forest back, despite its positive influence on seedling recruitment of native species (Cordell et al. 2009; Ostertag et al. 2009). Given current conditions, the forest is poised to lose most of its native species and become like most of the forest patches remaining in the lowlands – almost exclusively non-native dominated. The trait-based method we used employs five steps. We illustrate the method's use in HLWF; however, it need not include the use of non-native species, and it is exportable to other ecosystems. Land managers at KMR are charged with specific targets developed by the US military. These are as follows: (i) conserving and encouraging the regeneration of native biodiversity at the site, (ii) controlling invasive species and (iii) encouraging carbon storage on the landscape. Because restoring this area to an all-native ecosystem is no longer economically feasible, we elected to create hybrid ecosystems. Our experimental communities were assembled using species whose combined functional trait profiles addressed these three management goals to meet restoration objectives of the main stakeholders. We had two main considerations for choosing the traits on which to base our species selection. First, we wanted to estimate the 'functional role' or 'strategy' (sensu Reich 2014) of different species within HLWF environments, and secondly, we wanted to identify specific traits that would address our restoration objectives. We first looked at the overall distribution of HLWF species in trait space and then focused on how different species expressed particular traits that were relevant to our restoration objectives. The functional traits measured (Table 1) were derived from literature and field data. We included traits that are informative in the ecological context of HLWF. For example, knowing that light (rather than nutrient or water availability) is the primary limiting resource for native species in this forest (Ostertag et al. 2009), we included a suite of traits related to light capture (as well as canopy and understorey architecture; including leaf : petiole ratio, plant height and canopy shape). Many of the traits we measured are informative of more than one aspect of a plant species' ecological strategy, and some traits can be used as proxies for others, which are more difficult to measure. For example, we included both maximum plant height and seed mass as proxies for dispersal distance (see Thomson et al. 2011). The potential species pool included native species thought to have been present at the site historically, native species currently found at the site and non-native species already found in the region that are believed to pose low invasion risk. To address the latter, we based our decisions on the Hawaiian Weed Risk Assessment score (Daehler et al. 2004; see In a past study at KMR, woody species richness was nine native species and 10 introduced species (Zimmerman et al. 2008). Due to a lack of formal records of species occurrence and poor pollen preservation, it is difficult to ascertain which species would have been found historically in any given area of HLWF. Because we suspect that some native species once found at KMR have been locally extirpated, we cast a wide net in order to determine which species could potentially be used for restoring the forest. We included native species with similar environmental requirements that could have occurred in HLWF, based on historical range descriptions by Wagner, Herbst & Sohmer (1999) and previous field experience. Once the list of potential species was compiled (including 17 non-native and 19 native species), we eliminated species which were too difficult to sample or propagate, and species for which sufficient data were not available – reducing our pool to 16 native species and 15 non-native species. Other limiting factors that practitioners should consider include economics (e.g. cost of seeds, plants, labour or time), logistics (e.g. availability of species, project or budget timelines), resilience to climatic change or disturbance regimes, as well as the goals and expectations of stakeholders. We sampled plant traits across the full range of conditions in which HLWF is found regionally in order to account for both site and environmental heterogeneity. In total, we sampled traits at 25 sites throughout east Hawai'i Island, in addition to using existing data from the literature. By far, the most time-consuming and effort-consuming steps in making species choices by using traits are creating the potential species pool and collecting trait data. However, compilations of trait data are increasingly common world-wide. A variety of data sets are available either directly from researchers and agencies involved in the region (e.g. the Australian Virtual Herbarium) or from collaborative data base compilations (e.g. TRY ( DRYAD ( or LEDA ( Once the trait data were assembled, we grouped the information for each trait into quartiles in order to account for both analytical constraints and the nature of trait data. Because we considered both multiple traits and multiple species, making meaningful comparisons was often challenging. For example, measures of seed mass spanned many orders of magnitude from <0·001 to 576 g, while the maximum difference in leaf thickness measured no more than 0·4 mm (Table 1). Furthermore, sometimes it is necessary to compare ratios and categories to numerical data. The use of quartiles places more importance on the relative differences in trait values. This approach emphasizes species which are 'outliers' rather than species that display the 'middle range' (i.e. the most or least effective water use vs. the species whose values are nearest to the group mean). This type of data manipulation is appropriate to the multivariate ordination analysis we later employ. We used a principal components analysis (PCA) to show how the selected species are arranged, relative to one another, in trait space and to provide an idea of each species' functional profile. Other multivariate techniques could be substituted. An important outcome of the PCA was the prominent separation of native and non-native species in distinct areas of the graph, primarily based on leaf mass per area, carbon : nitrogen ratio and foliar nitrogen (Fig. 1a). This result reinforces that species in Hawai'i with different biogeographic origins are functionally divergent. Hawaiian species tend to be conservative in regard to growth and nutrient acquisition, whereas the non-native species tend towards faster life-history strategies. Carbon turnover rates are substantially higher in invasive-dominated communities than they are in native plant communities (Hughes et al. 2014). With this in mind, we ran an additional PCA using only traits associated with carbon cycling (including specific gravity, foliar chemistry and maximum plant height) to find which species from our pool have the greatest likelihood of slow rates of carbon turnover (Fig. 1b). We identified two groups of four 'core species' whose trait profiles indicate either slow or moderate carbon turnover, and then located these core species on the first (general) PCA of all species traits (Fig. 1a). Based on Euclidian distances within the general PCA, we determined a centroid point equidistant from all four species in each group and then selected groups of additional species that were closer (i.e. most similar and potentially most redundant) and furthest (i.e. least similar and potentially most complementary) to each centroid (Fig. 1c). The motivation for this selection was that we are trying to determine whether combinations of species whose traits are more dissimilar (complementary) or similar (redundant) confer greater invasion resistance in the hybrid forests (Funk et al. 2008). Once species are displayed in trait space, a variety of decisions can be made based on their relative functional profiles. While our process included two PCAs, for some restoration objectives, decisions could be made with only one (Fig. 1a). In our case, pragmatic and logistical concerns were addressed at this point. For example, one of our species was removed, because although it was culturally important, and functionally a good fit, it is unable to maintain itself without direct, ongoing human intervention. Alternatively, when several species proved to be functionally similar, final species choice was based on pragmatic considerations such as seedling cost, availability within given time frames or projected time to maturity. In short, the process allows for an unbiased way to let the data dictate a first step, and then, the practical concerns of practitioners can be layered onto the final species choices. To date, multiple studies have evaluated the role of functional traits in ecosystems and/or been carried out in controlled settings and relatively simple ecosystems such as grasslands (Drenovsky & James 2010; Fry, Power & Manning 2013; Lavorel 2013). We show that a trait-based approach can also be used in a tropical forest system. Because the metrics are based on site-specific restoration objectives, this approach is generalizable, flexible and transferable across ecosystems and taxa. Once refined, the approach can be applied with relatively little effort by managers. We named our project Liko Nā Pilina, which translates loosely to 'the budding new relationships', to emphasize the developing associations among the species, and the intertwining of fundamental science questions and the practical needs of land managers faced with a formidable task made more daunting by lack of information on how to achieve their restoration goals. While it is too early to determine if the treatments met our objectives, results 1 year after planting show >90% survival of outplants and increased seedling recruitment by native species. By creating hybrid ecosystems using both native and non-native species (many of which are culturally significant), the project melds together traditional and contemporary approaches to forest management. This has proved attractive to the general public, school groups and summer programmes, allowing us to tap into an eager set of volunteers. In our experience, the level of community engagement is unusual for science-based restoration experiments. Thus, this new type of restoration can fulfil many goals, providing a rigorous way to choose species for restoration as well as providing a simple framework that is appealing to local communities.

The present article investigates beyond the pairwise competitive interactions and provides a novel perspective for understanding the influence of higher-order interactions on the evolution of social phenotypes. Our simple model yields a prosperous outlook to demonstrate the impact of perturbations on intransitive competitive higher-order interactions. Using a mathematical technique, we show how alone the perturbed interaction network can quickly determine the coexistence equilibrium of competing species instead of solving a large system of ordinary differential equations. It is possible to split the system into multiple feasible cluster states depending on the number of perturbations. Our analysis also reveals that the ratio between the unperturbed and perturbed species is inversely proportional to the amount of employed perturbation. Our results suggest that nonlinear dynamical systems and interaction topologies can be interplayed to comprehend species' coexistence under adverse conditions.
