Yet there is considerable debate about their nature, strength and overall importance. This debate stems in part from continued uncertainty about the ultimate mechanisms driving cascading effects. We present a synthesis of empirical evidence in support of one possible ultimate mechanism: the foraging‐predation risk trade‐offs undertaken by intermediary species. We show that simple trade‐off behaviour can lead to both positive and negative indirect effects of predators on plant resources and hence can explain considerable contingency on the nature and strength of cascading effects among systems. Thus, predicting the sign and strength of indirect effect simply requires knowledge of habitat and resource use by prey with regard to predators’ presence, habitat use and hunting mode. The synthesis allows us to postulate a hypothesis for new conceptualization of trophic cascades which is to be viewed as an ultimate trade‐off between intervening species. In this context, different predators apply different rules of engagement based on their hunting mode and habitat use. These different rules then determine whether behavioural effects persist or attenuate at the level of the food chain.",W2124528330,True,0.9890607595443726
https://doi.org/10.1890/04-1249,RESOURCE COMPETITION MODIFIES THE STRENGTH OF TRAIT-MEDIATED PREDATOR–PREY INTERACTIONS: A META-ANALYSIS,"Only a fraction of the individuals in a given prey population are likely to be killed and consumed by predators. In contrast, nearly all individuals experience the chronic effects of predation risk. When threatened by predators, prey adopt defensive tactics whose costs can lead to reduced growth, maturation rates, survivorship, fecundity, or population density. This nonconsumptive impact of predation risk on prey is known as a ""trait-mediated interaction"" (TMI) because it results from changes in prey traits such as behavior or physiology. Ecological theory suggests that the strength of TMI effects will reflect a balance between the conflicting demands of reproduction vs. predator avoidance. Competitor density and resource availability are expected to alter the balance between these conflicting forces. We conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured TMI effect size while varying competitor and/or resource density. The threat of predation had an overall negative effect on prey performance, but the strength of this effect varied with the level of competition. High competition exacerbated the negative effect of intimidation on prey density but moderated the negative effect of intimidation on prey life history and growth. We discuss these results in light of previously published theoretical expectations. Our results highlight the variable and context-dependent nature of interspecific interactions.",W2044321783,True,0.9932403564453125

To date, this work has primarily focused on the effects of predator-induced behavioral plasticity on communities. However, predator-induced morphological plasticity, which has been documented in many taxa, might also lead to trait-mediated indirect effects. Here, I examined how predators altered the behavior and morphology of larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and leopard frogs (R. pipiens) and how these phenotypic changes altered the outcome of competition between the two species. Competition in the absence of caged predators was asymmetric; when reared separately, leopard frogs grew more than wood frogs, but when competing (without predators), wood frogs grew faster than leopard frogs. The presence of caged predators reversed the outcome of competition between the two anuran prey. In the presence of larval dragonflies (Anax spp.) or caged mudminnows (Umbra limi), leopard frogs grew faster than wood frogs while total tadpole biomass production remained unchanged. Thus, there was a predator-mediated indirect effect. Because predators alter both the behavior and morphology of larval anurans and both of these traits are known to affect resource consumption and growth, both are potential mechanisms to explain the change in competitive outcome. Changes in behavior were not related to changes in growth, but changes in morphology (specifically mouth width and tail length) were related to changes in growth. When competitors were added (without predators), wood frogs increased their mouth width by 10% and their tail length by 3%, while leopard frogs increased their mouth width by 5% and did not change their tail length. The greater increase in mouth width for wood frogs should increase their forage intake, since tadpoles feed by scraping periphyton; the importance of a 3% longer tail in competitive ability is unknown. The presence of the predator threat (via chemical cues from the caged predators) reduced both the mouth width and tail length in the two prey species to pre-competition levels. This response corresponded with the reduced competitive ability of the wood frogs. This work demonstrates that both competitors and predators can alter prey morphology and suggests that changes in morphology can cause trait-mediated indirect effects.",W2134929066,True,0.9956339001655579

Furthermore, since most biological communities are not simple food chains but complex networks of interactions, one TMII within a community might easily be influenced by another TMII. In other words, TMII themselves can be cascades with potential implications for community dynamics. Here we report on one of such cascade, where a parasitic fly induces behavioral changes that disrupt a trait-mediated ant–hemipteran mutualism. We show that during parasite-induced low-activity periods, the ant Azteca instabilis fails to protect its mutualistic scale-insect partner against predatory ladybeetles. Thus, in the presence of the parasite, ladybeetles ate as many scales in ant-patrolled plants as they did in ant-free plants. These results demonstrate how, through a cascade of trait-mediated interactions, associations between members of a community can be drastically altered.",W2162163837,True,0.9337142109870911
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-9563.2008.00427.x,"Trophic promiscuity, intraguild predation and the problem of omnivores","Does anybody else miss the good old days of trophic levels? When predators, herbivores and plants knew their place and interacted in appropriate linear chains (Hairston et al., 1960; Oksanen, 1981)? We released biological control agents under the optimistic assumption that they would attack their designated prey, more or less, and at least leave organisms at other trophic levels well alone. We built management programmes and mathematical models based on this assumption (Berryman, 1992). We lived in simpler times. No longer. Omnivores, apparently, are everywhere, practicing their trophic promiscuity in complex and dynamic fashion (Rosenheim, 2007). Predators eat predators, herbivores and, incorrigibly, sometimes plants (Coll & Guershon, 2002). Food chains have become passé, replaced by reticulate webs that defy our simple notions of stability as well as all sense of propriety (Polis et al., 1989; Holt & Polis, 1997). We are face to face with the uncomfortable reality that our agents of control often eat more broadly than we would like them to. We live in the days of the omnivores. Ecologists who work in unmanaged systems have long been acquainted with the vexing issue of omnivory. Random food webs built on Lotka–Volterra predator–prey equations become less stable with omnivory (Pimm, 1982), unless the omnivorous compartments (or loops) within the webs are characterized by weak links (Neutel et al., 2007) or nonlinearities (McCann & Hastings, 1997). In other words, omnivory should be either rare or weak for systems to persist. Yet omnivory is apparently ubiquitous (Denno & Fagan, 2003; Arim & Marquet, 2004) and, judging by a casual glance at the ants alone, the links are hardly trivial (Davidson et al., 2003; Helms & Vinson, 2008; Ottonetti et al., 2008). For entomologists who work in managed systems, questions of omnivory are taking centre stage in research on agents of biological control. The compatibility of multiple control agents, interactions between native and introduced predators, damage to crops and the spread of crop pathogens are all influenced by the degree to which insects practice omnivory. We have always worried, to some degree, about nontarget effects of biological control agents, but concerns most often were for species at the same trophic level as the target of our control efforts (Simberloff & Stiling, 1996; Hawkins & Marino, 1997; Louda & Stiling, 2004; Stiling, 2004). More and more, we recognize that nontarget effects of biological control agents can emerge at multiple trophic levels (Rosenheim et al., 1995; Rosenheim, 1998) with the potential to compromise control efforts and influence associated ecosystems. High rates of omnivory may be responsible in part for the spread of exotic invasive predators and the decline of their native counterparts (Snyder et al., 2004b), with successful invaders being those species with adaptations to counter the ravages of omnivorous predators (Sato & Dixon, 2004). I have been thinking about this recently, in part because of the loss of our friend, colleague, and champion of omnivory research, Robert F. (Bob) Denno, who died last year. Others are more qualified to describe the profound and lasting influence that Bob had on the field of entomology. One of his interests in recent years was the study of omnivory, and his group helped to stimulate cutting-edge research on omnivores in natural and managed systems. This paper is not a tribute to Bob's research. Rather, his passing prompted me to think about the advances in omnivore research made during the last 5 years or so (I cheat with reference to a few important papers of finer vintage), and I present some highlights here with particular reference to managed systems. Omnivores are organisms that feed on more than one trophic level (Pimm & Lawton, 1978). Omnivores therefore include 'herbivores' that engage in cannibalism, 'predators' that suck plant juices or consume seeds or pollen and 'predators' that feed on other predators as well as herbivores (Coll & Guershon, 2002; Denno & Fagan, 2003). Most of us are familiar with ants as prototypical omnivores. Many ant species will consume animal tissue, plant exudates, phloem, seeds (or their elaiosomes) and honeydew produced by herbivorous insects (Carroll & Janzen, 1973). At least for some ant species, omnivory is not simply a response to low resource availability. For example, colonies of the invasive red imported fire ant Solenopsis invicta in the southern U.S.A. grow 50% larger in the presence of honeydew-producing insects than they do when provided with unlimited access to insect prey (Helms & Vinson, 2008). Given that honeydew is generally thought to be a lower-quality resource than animal tissue (Speight et al., 2008), there must be something about resource diversity that is important to fire ants. A subset of omnivores, known as intraguild predators (Polis et al., 1989), feed on prey items and the prey of their prey (Fig. 1). As a result, intraguild (IG) predators both eat IG prey and compete with them for resources. Intraguild predation (IGP) appears to be astonishingly common in nature, with 58–87% of species engaged in IGP interactions in the 113 food webs analysed by Arim and Marquet (2004). This is a staggering proportion of species, and a clear challenge to the notion of discrete trophic levels. According to a wide variety of models of intraguild predation (IGP), coexistence (stability) is possible only when the IG prey is a stronger competitor than the IG predator for the shared resource and only at intermediate levels of resource productivity (Holt & Polis, 1997; Borer et al., 2007). At low resource productivity, the IG predator is excluded, whereas, at high resource productivity, the IG prey is excluded. Given the apparent prevalence of IGP in nature over wide ranges of resource productivity, there must be additional coexistence mechanisms that act to stabilize IGP interactions. These might include cannibalism among predators (Rudolf, 2007), spatial or temporal refuges for the participants (Amarasekare, 2007; Janssen et al., 2007), additional density-dependent processes operating on species (Ives et al., 2005) or additional prey available to the consumers (Briggs & Borer, 2005; Holt & Huxel, 2007). A simple illustration of intraguild predation where the intraguild predator consumes the intraguild prey when competing with it for the crop pest. Pest suppression can be compromised, thus reducing crop yields. If all of the above sounds a bit abstract, consider an example. The harlequin bug Murgantia histrionica is a specialist herbivore on bladderpod Isomeris arborea in California. The eggs of the harlequin bug are parasitized by two specialist parasitoids, Trissolcus murgantiae and Ooencyrtus johnsonii (Amarasekare, 2000). Because they overlap in resource use (harlequin bug eggs) and because O. johnsonii consumes T. murgantiae (but not vice versa) when they co-occur, the system is an example of IGP; O. johnsonii is the IG predator and T. murgantiae is the IG prey. All species coexist over a broad range of resource productivity (i.e. new bug eggs per unit time) and, in this case, the interaction is apparently stabilized by a temporal refuge for the IG prey. Trissolcus murgantiae is active at cooler temperatures and has an early-season time window during which it is free from competition with, and predation by, O. johnsonii (Amarasekare, 2007). I mentioned earlier that omnivory is apparently much more common than we once thought. Why should omnivory be common in nature? Omnivores are an interesting form of dietary generalists, extending their dietary breadth beyond their own trophic level to encompass prey items at additional trophic levels. A generalist diet is considered by some to evolve in response to a trade-off between dietary quality and dietary quantity, and this same logic has been applied to the evolution of insect omnivores (Denno & Fagan, 2003). For example, if the highest-quality food source for an organism is also the most abundant, there should be no selection pressure (or ecological benefit) for a generalist diet and specialization should result (Krebs & Davies, 1993). As described in some ancient religious texts, there are no omnivores in a world awash in manna. However, as the highest-quality food source becomes increasingly diluted by more common, lower quality food, dietary breadth should increase. Denno and Fagan (2003) have suggested that omnivorous predators are supplementing their diet of low-nitrogen herbivores with higher-nitrogen predators. Omnivory, then, is seen as a strategy by which herbivore-eaters improve their lot. A complementary view might be that higher-order predators are required to incorporate lower quality herbivores into their diet because other predators are too rare as sources of food. In other words, the relative scarcity of prey with high concentrations of nitrogen in their body tissues (i.e. other arthropod predators) should result in the incorporation of herbivores (intermediate nitrogen concentrations) and plants (low nitrogen concentrations) into the diet of some predators. Omnivory is therefore favoured by the relative scarcity of food items that are good stoichiometric matches to the consumer. Of course, the evolution of omnivory is not just about stoichiometry (Matsumura et al., 2004). Diet mixing in general can dilute toxins in food, reduce the risk of predation or parasitism, and increase resistance to natural enemies (Singer & Bernays, 2003). There are evolutionary challenges to omnivory because omnivores must be able to catch, handle, digest and assimilate a broader range of prey types than their trophically-conservative relatives. We might therefore expect to see phylogenetic patterns in the evolution of omnivory and, indeed, we do. For example, within ancestrally herbivorous and ancestrally predaceous lineages of terrestrial heteropterans, seed and pollen feeding and broad host ranges are both correlated with the evolution of omnivory (Eubanks et al., 2003). In other words, existing morphological and physiological traits can pre-adapt certain groups to an omnivorous lifestyle (Coll & Guershon, 2002). Our efforts at biological control are often conceived under the assumption of simple food chains. They reflect our desire to manage trophic cascades (Paine, 1980; Carpenter et al., 1985), whereby the abundance of top predators (agents of control) determines the standing crop of primary producers (our crops of interest) (Hunter & Price, 1992; Hunter, 2001). Omnivory may dampen the effects of trophic cascades (Strong, 1992; McCann et al., 1998; Denno, 2007), reducing herbivore suppression by natural enemies and increasing plant damage (Finke & Denno, 2004, 2005). For those of us engaged in the control and management of insect pests, one question is obviously central: does the presence or introduction of multiple enemy species, including omnivores, increase or decrease pest suppression? In other words, how badly do intraguild predation and omnivory interfere with biological control? Quite often, the introduction of multiple agents of control results in the establishment of only a single dominant control agent (Denoth et al., 2002). However, when multiple control agents are naturally or artificially established, what are the consequences for pest suppression? First, consider simple models of IGP. We established above that IG predators and IG prey can sometimes coexist, through a variety of ecological mechanisms either intrinsic or extrinsic to their interactions. What does ecological theory tell us about the suppression of their shared prey: the pests of our production systems? As a reminder, we have to be careful to distinguish between pest 'production', which broadly describes the addition (birth, immigration) of new pest individuals per unit time, and the standing biomass of pests, which describes their average densities in the cropping system. Pest densities can be low, even if pest production is high, when rates of predation are also high. With that in mind, theory predicts that the IG predator should become relatively more abundant (and the IG prey relatively less abundant) as pest productivity increases (Holt & Polis, 1997). Moreover, pest density should also increase as the IG predator increases in dominance. This is exactly what occurs in the dynamics of the iconic California red scale, Aonidiella aurantii, which is parasitized by Aphytis melanus (IG predator) and Encarsia perniciosi (IG prey). As the productivity (i.e. fecundity) of red scale increases among sites, there is an increase in the relative density of the IG predator, A. melanus, and a corresponding increase in scale standing stock (density) (Borer et al., 2003). What that means for pest managers, of course, is a higher pest density as the IG predator comes to dominate the dynamics. Simply put, simple theory tells us that IGP should reduce the suppression of pests by biological control agents. However, empirical studies provide a greater range of outcomes than predicted by simple theory, and the literature includes examples of negative, neutral and positive interactions among predators that share prey resources. A recent meta-analysis has suggested that prey suppression is more often higher in diverse than in simple predator communities (Cardinale et al., 2006), although issues of omnivory were not examined directly. In a second meta-analysis focused more specifically on omnivory, mutual IGP (when predator species can consume each other) was shown to compromise pest suppression in multi-predator systems, whereas unidirectional IGP (or the absence of IGP) did not (Vance-Chalcraft et al., 2007). In other words, the strength and form of IGP in diverse predator communities appears to determine subsequent effects on pest suppression. As a gentle reminder, meta-analyses are usually aggregates of studies that report both significant positive and negative effects; the negative reports do not cease to be valid in their own right just because they are less common on average than the positive ones. Perhaps the more interesting question is why the effects of multi-predator species on pest suppression appear to be context dependent (Straub & Snyder, 2008). We are making major progress in answering this question, in part because theory on interactions among predator species is being linked to theory on relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem processes (Ives et al., 2005). We have learnt from these efforts that there exist at least four mechanisms by which predator diversity influences pest suppression. These are: (i) sampling (or lottery) effects (the presence or absence of dominant predators); (ii) resource partitioning among predators; (iii) indirect effects caused by intraguild predation; and (iv) non-additive effects among predators (Ives et al., 2005). This is a critical observation because it allows us to reconcile studies in which increasing predator diversity is associated with either higher or lower levels of pest suppression. The relative importance of the four mechanisms described above in a particular production system of interest will probably determine whether high predator diversity increases or decreases crop yield. For example, we might expect that multiple predators with strong additive or synergistic effects will increase pest suppression and increase crop yields, whereas multiple predators engaged in high levels of intraguild predation should decrease pest suppression and crop yield (Rosenheim, 1998; Sih et al., 1998; Snyder & Ives, 2003). The study by Ives et al. (2005) provides a roadmap for future research on the effects of multi-predator species on pest suppression because a series of predictions is made that should be testable in production systems. For example, their analyses suggest that the sampling effect will tend to cause a reduction in pest densities as predator diversity increases, so long as predators vary in their assimilation efficiencies or capture rates. Likewise, resource partitioning by predators among multiple species of prey will also tend to cause reductions in the average pest burden on plants as predator density increases. The latter effect of resource partitioning raises an important point: the predicted effects of predator–predator interactions on pest suppression depend upon the number of pest species within the production system. For example, if there is only one pest in the cropping system, or one that is dramatically more important to yield than all others, then IGP will probably lead to higher levels of crop damage. However, models also show that, in speciose pest communities, the total density of the entire herbivore community should still decline with increasing predator diversity when IGP is operating (Ives et al., 2005). This suggests that crops with diverse pest species may suffer less overall damage with diverse predator populations, even when those predators engage in IGP. In brief, the overall impact of IGP on pest suppression depends in part on the diversity of pests in the cropping system. It appears that any negative impacts of IGP on pest suppression may be weak in comparison to the positive effects of predator diversity in multipest systems. The apparent ubiquity of omnivory and intraguild predation (Arim & Marquet, 2004) has prompted much recent empirical work, aimed at untangling the effects of predator–predator interactions on herbivore suppression. In a series of clever experiments, Finke and Denno (2005) measured independently the effects of predator diversity and intraguild predation on herbivores and plants in a salt marsh ecosystem. They demonstrated that increasing predator diversity had little impact on herbivores and plants unless the predators engaged in intraguild predation. Under those circumstances, herbivore suppression declined and plant biomass was concomitantly reduced. Generalizing, multi-predator species appeared to be detrimental to plants when they engaged in intraguild predation. Yet some notorious IG predators can apparently participate in successful biological control. In experimental studies of pea aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum on alfalfa in the Midwestern U.S.A., suppression of pea aphids is higher (with corresponding higher alfalfa yields) with higher diversity of natural enemies (Cardinale et al., 2003). In this interesting case, the presence of generalist predators (Harmonia axyridis and Nabis sp.) causes declines in the associated cowpea aphid Aphis craccivora with the result that a key parasitoid, Aphidius ervi, focuses its prodigious powers of parasitism on pea aphids. The result is greater (non-additive) suppression of pea aphids than would be predicted from the sum of the effects of each enemy in isolation. Pest suppression occurs despite the fact that both Harmonia and Nabis are well-known omnivores, attacking other predators as well as herbivores (Snyder & Ives, 2003). What I particularly like about this study is that it includes measurements of crop yield, providing compelling evidence that growers should benefit from the presence of a diverse predator community. It also illustrates that positive indirect effects of high predator diversity can overcome simultaneous negative effects of IGP, as suggested by Ives et al. (2005). Similarly, a diverse predator assemblage can result in suppression of aphid pests, and higher crop yields, in collards Brassica oleracea (Snyder et al., 2006). In the U.S.A., collards are attacked by the green peach aphid Myzus persicae and the cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicae. In turn, these aphids are attacked by a diverse predator assemblage, including the predatory bugs Geocoris pallens and Nabis spp., the ladybird beetles Coccinella septempunctata and Hippodamia convergens, and the parasitoid wasp Diaeretiella rapae. All of these predators are actually omnivores, engaging in IGP. As a result, IGP has the potential to interfere with pest suppression and increase levels of crop damage. Nonetheless, any negative effects of IGP on pest suppression are swamped by positive effects of predator complementarity, which keep aphid numbers low and increase collard production (Snyder et al., 2006). Similar results were recently reported for potato (Straub & Snyder, 2008). Glasshouse production systems may also benefit from multi-predator introductions, even in the presence of IGP. In the U.S.A., the aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae is a significant pest of greenhouse-grown roses. It is attacked by the parasitoid Aphelinus asychis, which can also establish in greenhouses. It appears that simultaneous introduction of the parasitoid and the coccinellid beetle H. axyridis has no deleterious impact on aphid suppression by the parasitoid (Snyder et al., 2004a). Rather, control is complementary, despite the fact that the beetle consumes mummified aphids that contain parasitoid pupae (intraguild predation). Biological control is improved in the presence of the beetle because it prefers to consume unparasitized, rather than parasitized, aphids. What actions can pest managers take to reduce the probability that IGP will interfere with pest suppression under multi-predator biological control? One possibility might be to increase the heterogeneity of the cropping system. Evidence is accumulating that high habitat heterogeneity can ameliorate the negative effects of IGP on prey suppression. Structured habitats appear to provide refuges for IG prey from their IG predators, favouring the coexistence of multiple predator species (Finke & Denno, 2006; Janssen et al., 2007). For example, in salt marsh ecosystems, spiders and mirid bugs combine to attack populations of Prokelisia planthoppers on Spartina. In the presence of abundant leaf litter (thatch), predators have refuges from IGP, with the result that plant hopper populations decline and plant biomass increases (Finke & Denno, 2006). In the absence of thatch, IGP prevents the trophic cascade from operating, and planthoppers cause declines in plant biomass. In the same system, habitat heterogeneity can also act to reduce rates of cannibalism among predators, a particularly unpleasant yet widespread form of intraguild predation (Langellotto & Denno, 2006). Although habitat heterogeneity does not always result in short-term pest suppression, (Langellotto & Denno, 2004; Janssen et al., 2007)), long-term persistence of a diverse enemy pool may facilitate long-term suppression of pest populations as environments vary over time. A tentative conclusion from the discussion above might be that omnivorous predators can still promote pest suppression and higher crop yields, at least in systems with multiple pest species and high habitat heterogeneity. However, what if those predators also eat plants? Is there a place for crop-eating predators in biological control? Of course, there is a long evolutionary history of mutualism between plants and predators by which plants provide food or shelter for predators in return for predation services (Speight et al., 2008). We might therefore expect that the benefits to plants of supporting plant-feeding predators should often outweigh the costs. It turns out that many predators and parasitoids will consume plant material and still contribute to pest suppression. Zoophytophagy, the habit of consuming plant and animal tissue, is common in agroecosystems among the Heteroptera, Neuroptera, Thysanoptera, Phytoseiidae (Acarina) and Coccinellidae (Coleoptera) (Robinson et al., 2008). Zoophytophagy can be beneficial to biological control, despite plant damage, if it maintains predator populations during periods of low prey abundance (Coll & Guershon, 2002). However, if the crop plants are chemically treated or genetically transformed, plant-feeding has the potential to reduce predator populations (Moser et al., 2008). Zoophytophagous bugs in the family Heteroptera are notorious omnivores, feeding on both plant tissue and insect prey. Indeed, the availability of suitable plant species for oviposition and feeding may increase Heteropteran performance and their subsequent efficacy as agents of control (Lundgren et al., 2008). Typically, however, plants are assumed to be low-quality resources for zoophytophages, exploited largely when animal prey is at low abundance. For example, Nesidiocoris tenuis (Heteroptera: Miridae) is a zoophytophage on whitefly and tomatoes in greenhouse production systems. The occurrence of plant feeding by N. tenuis increases as its own density increases and decreases as whitefly prey become more abundant (Sanchez, 2008). Rapid decreases in N. tenuis populations after whitefly declines demonstrate that plants are poorer nutrient sources for predators than are whitefly prey. The benefits to omnivorous predators of plant-feeding may vary from simple water uptake in some systems to significant nutrient and energy gain in others (Robinson et al., 2008; Sanchez, 2008). For example, the coccinellid beetle Coleomegilla maculata is an important biological control agent of corn pests in the U.S.A. It feeds on corn pollen during larval and adult stages, with adult pollen consumption exceeding a prodigious 13 mg per beetle (Lundgren et al., 2005). Given such high potential consumption of plant resources by omnivores (Wackers et al., 2008), it should be no surprise that there are commercially available 'nutrient supplements' for use with biological control agents. However, it is important to note that their value in pest suppression is not well established (Wade et al., 2008). Whether there is a net positive or negative effect of zoophytophagy on pest suppression may depend upon environmental conditions, including pest density and the period over which pest dynamics are measured. For example, adult lacewings consume floral resources (nectar, pollen) as well as aphid prey on buckwheat in New Zealand (Robinson et al., 2008). In the presence of buckwheat flowers, lacewings consume fewer aphids each day, with an apparently negative effect of omnivory on pest suppression. However, at lower aphid densities, a propensity for flower-feeding reduces the pre-oviposition period of lacewing adults, increasing their oviposition rates (i.e. a long-term positive effect on pest suppression at the population level). This is a key point: short-term experiments tend to illustrate potential negative impacts of omnivory and IGP on pest suppression that may be more than compensated for by long-term benefits under field conditions (Ives et al., 2005; Robinson et al., 2008). As a final thought on zoophytophagy, plants engineered to express toxins might be expected to have negative impacts upon omnivorous predators, and such effects have been documented over the years subsequent to the deployment of transgenic plants. However, most effects appear to be weak. For example, the coccinellid C. maculata, and the invasive coccinellid Harmonia axyridis will feed on corn leaf tissue, even when aphid prey and water are in abundant supply (Moser et al., 2008). Given that most corn in the U.S.A. is now transformed to express Bt toxins, coccinellids might suffer from feeding on transgenic corn. Rates of larval development in C. maculata appear to decline slightly when fed on Bt corn seedlings, but the effect is not particularly strong (Moser et al., 2008). With some exceptions, then, omnivores still appear to be our friends. They add diversity to the predator pool that is available to suppress the pests of our production systems. Their pathways of consumption may be reticulate and their interactions indirect, but they can often contribute to biological control in important ways. To maximize the benefits and minimize the risks associated with using omnivores in biological control, there are several lines of future work that would be beneficial. I have already mentioned the important predictions provided by the theoretical work of Ives et al. (2005) that need to be tested. Additionally, stable isotope analyses are providing more detailed descriptions of the relative consumption by omnivores of different food sources. For example, in Tuscan olive orchards, 13C signatures demonstrate that ants gain energy from both olive-based and herb-based food webs. In the same system, different ant species vary in their use of plant-based and animal-based resources, as illustrated by their 15N signatures (Ottonetti et al., 2008). Such studies provide vital information on the energy pathways used by omnivores in production systems and appear to support the important role of habitat heterogeneity in mediating the positive impacts of omnivores in pest suppression. Moreover, as Bob Denno would have pointed out, we need to consider in much more detail how the behaviours and life histories of predators and prey influence the strength and direction of interactions in omnivorous food webs (Denno et al., 2003; Rosenheim & Corbett, 2003; Singer & Bernays, 2003). We should also continue to explore effects of omnivory on pest suppression that appear influenced by ecological contingency, particularly variation caused by seasonality, habitat structure and nutrient availability (Gratton & Denno, 2003; Denno et al., 2005). Omnivores may complicate our traditional naïve views of pest management, but there is no denying that they make life more interesting.",W2099415115,True,0.9725580215454102

Leaf pubescence has been repeatedly shown to mediate predator‐herbivore interactions whereas the influence of leaf pubescence on predator–predator interactions such as intraguild predation (IGP) has seldom been investigated. Using a three‐pronged approach we assessed the influence of leaf pubescence on the predatory mites Kampimodromus aberrans and Euseius finlandicus. Both predators occur on broad‐leaved trees in Europe. Euseius finlandicus is mostly found on trees with glabrous leaves whereas K. aberrans mainly occurs on trees with pubescent leaves. We hypothesized that leaf pubescence mediates IGP between K. aberrans and E. finlandicus and thereby determines their dominance and proportional abundance. A field survey on apple revealed that the abundance of K. aberrans and E. finlandicus is negatively correlated, with the former predominating on cultivars with strongly pubescent leaves and the latter predominating on cultivars with little pubescent or glabrous leaves. Microhabitat choice tests showed that K. aberrans preferentially resides on pubescent leaves whereas E. finlandicus preferentially resides on glabrous leaves. The effects of leaf pubescence on survival and development of immature IG predators and IG prey were reversed for K. aberrans and E. finlandicus. In the presence of the IG predator E. finlandicus, immature K. aberrans had higher survival probabilities on pubescent leaves than on glabrous ones. In contrast, the survival chances of immature E. finlandicus were higher on glabrous leaves than on pubescent ones when the IG predator K. aberrans was present. Artificial leaf pubescence enhanced IG prey capture by immature K. aberrans and prolonged their longevity but impaired IG prey capture by immature E. finlandicus and shortened their longevity. We conclude that leaf pubescence mediates IGP strength and symmetry and discuss the implications to natural and biological control.",W2021103581,True,0.9730757474899292
https://doi.org/10.1111/jzo.12127,Trait‐mediated effects between predators: ant chemical cues induce spider dispersal,"Abstract Predators can induce changes in prey phenotype such as dispersal, activity and foraging rate. Such trait‐mediated effects ( TME s) can strongly affect prey populations and generate trophic cascades, rivaling the importance of predation in communities. However, the relevance of TME on intraguild interactions has rarely been addressed. Ants and spiders are widespread generalist predators in terrestrial habitats. Ants influence arthropod assemblages and disrupt top‐down effects of spiders on herbivores by killing spiders and/or by inducing spider emigration. Here, we examined whether ants induce dispersal behaviour in spiders. We tested the effect of chemical cues of two ant species ( L asius niger, F ormica clara ) on the walking activity and the propensity for silk‐based dispersal of spiders. Silk‐based dispersal of the web‐builder P hylloneta impressa increased by 80% with exposure to L asius cues, whereas dispersal of the hunting spider X ysticus more than doubled when confronted with cues of both L asius and F ormica. In addition, X ysticus individuals showed a marked increase in walking activity when exposed to F ormica but not L asius cues. Our results show for the first time that perceived predation risk influences spider dispersal. The strong effect of ant chemical cues on spider dispersal demonstrates that TME s contribute to the impact of ants on arthropod communities.",W1512314749,True,0.9655721783638
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1218,Herbivore density mediates the indirect effect of herbivores on plants via induced resistance and apparent competition,"Abstract Herbivore‐induced plant resistance and apparent competition are two indirect ways herbivores interact. If a less damaging herbivore indirectly suppresses the abundance of a more damaging herbivore via these mechanisms, then plants may ultimately benefit. Changes in herbivore density, however, can dictate the intensity of species interactions and may play a critical role in determining the outcome of plant‐ and predator‐mediated herbivore interactions. We tested the effects of herbivore density on the strength of indirect interactions among phloem‐feeding aphids and herbivorous caterpillars and the outcome of these interactions for their shared host plant, cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum ). We quantified the survival of caterpillars on host plants that were infested with varying densities of aphids in the presence and absence of predators (ladybeetles). We found that aphids induced defensive proteins in cotton plants and that caterpillar survival was negatively affected by induced resistance. Likewise, we found that the presence of aphids increased predation of caterpillars by ladybeetles, but that apparent competition between aphids and caterpillars was density dependent. Ladybeetles consumed relatively high numbers of small caterpillars at low to intermediate aphid densities, but essentially became aphid specialists at high aphid densities. Aphid induced defenses and apparent competition combined such that plant damage by caterpillars was lowest when predators were present at low aphid density (induced resistance + highest level of apparent competition). This suggests that herbivores can benefit plants, but the effect on host plants is mediated by herbivore density. Indirect herbivore‐plant mutualisms may increase plant quality, plant fitness, and yield of crop plants and these interactions need to be considered in ecologically based pest management plans. In addition, these interactions likely alter arthropod community structure and natural selection on anti‐herbivore defense traits in plants in natural systems.",W2291488578,True,0.9058406352996826
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12317,Density‐ and trait‐mediated effects of a parasite and a predator in a tri‐trophic food web,"Summary Despite growing interest in ecological consequences of parasitism in food webs, relatively little is known about effects of parasites on long‐term population dynamics of non‐host species or about whether such effects are density or trait mediated. We studied a tri‐trophic food chain comprised of (i) a bacterial basal resource ( S erratia fonticola ), (ii) an intermediate consumer ( P aramecium caudatum ), (iii) a top predator ( D idinium nasutum ) and (iv) a parasite of the intermediate consumer ( H olospora undulata ). A fully factorial experimental manipulation of predator and parasite presence/absence was combined with analyses of population dynamics, modelling and analyses of host ( P aramecium ) morphology and behaviour. Predation and parasitism each reduced the abundance of the intermediate consumer ( P aramecium ), and parasitism indirectly reduced the abundance of the basal resource ( S erratia ). However, in combination, predation and parasitism had non‐additive effects on the abundance of the intermediate consumer, as well as on that of the basal resource. In both cases, the negative effect of parasitism seemed to be effaced by predation. Infection of the intermediate consumer reduced predator abundance. Modelling and additional experimentation revealed that this was most likely due to parasite reduction of intermediate host abundance (a density‐mediated effect), as opposed to changes in predator functional or numerical response. Parasitism altered morphological and behavioural traits, by reducing host cell length and increasing the swimming speed of cells with moderate parasite loads. Additional tests showed no significant difference in D idinium feeding rate on infected and uninfected hosts, suggesting that the combination of these modifications does not affect host vulnerability to predation. However, estimated rates of encounter with S erratia based on these modifications were higher for infected Paramecium than for uninfected P aramecium. A mixture of density‐mediated and trait‐mediated indirect effects of parasitism on non‐host species creates rich and complex possibilities for effects of parasites in food webs that should be included in assessments of possible impacts of parasite eradication or introduction.",W2054928994,True,0.9832069873809814

It focuses on two well documented responses of consumers to predation risk: decrease in consumer activity and habitat switch. These behavioral effects are transmitted to resources and they cause similar indirect effects as those which are mediated by density changes in consumers. Two indirect interactions are studied in this article: trophic cascades, and apparent competition. Results for density only, trait only and combined density and trait mediated interactions are compared and discussed with respect to manipulation with predator density (top‐down manipulation) and resource environmental capacity (bottom‐up manipulation). The article shows that trait‐mediated effects on species equilibrial densities are similar to those of density‐mediated, but they are often highly non‐linear. Thus, they may have potential for even stronger impact on food webs than those which are density mediated.",W2107288913,True,0.9639219641685486
https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/380474,Trait-Mediated Indirect Effects of Phorid Flies on Ants,"This paper provides a synthesis of the ecological impact of phorid fly parasitoids on ants. We find the most important impact of phorids on ants to be trait-mediated effects. Phorids diminish the foraging activity of ants, frequently reducing the number and average size of foragers and reducing the amount of food retrieved by a colony. However, ants' coping mechanisms include changing foraging site and time. Phorids can also affect competition, especially through changes in the ability of the host to win in exploitative competition. Factors such as microclimate, resource size, and habitat complexity interact with phorids to change their effect on competition. By being highly specific and attacking ants high in the competitive hierarchy, phorids can alter the linear nature of the competitive transitivity, and by reducing the number of foragers, they can change the discovery-dominance tradeoff that is observed in some ant communities. Trait-mediated effects of phorids also cascade to other trophic levels. As an example, we discuss the trait-mediated cascade of phorids on the Azteca instabilis system in coffee. In this system, by reducing the foraging activity of A. instabilis, phorids reduce the direct and indirect biological control impact of the ant in the coffee agroecosystem.",W2008344466,True,0.9902246594429016
https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2016.2590,Moving beyond linear food chains: trait-mediated indirect interactions in a rocky intertidal food web,"In simple, linear food chains, top predators can have positive indirect effects on basal resources by causing changes in the traits (e.g. behaviour, feeding rates) of intermediate consumers. Although less is known about trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) in more complex food webs, it has been suggested that such complexity dampens trophic cascades. We examined TMIIs between a predatory crab ( Carcinus maenas ) and two ecologically important basal resources, fucoid algae ( Ascophyllum nodosum ) and barnacles ( Semibalanus balanoides ), which are consumed by herbivorous ( Littorina littorea ) and carnivorous ( Nucella lapillus ) snails, respectively. Because crab predation risk suppresses snail feeding rates, we hypothesized that crabs would also shape direct and indirect interactions among the multiple consumers and resources. We found that the magnitude of TMIIs between the crab and each resource depended on the suite of intermediate consumers present in the food web. Carnivorous snails ( Nucella ) transmitted TMIIs between crabs and barnacles. However, crab–algae TMIIs were transmitted by both herbivorous ( Littorina ) and carnivorous ( Nucella ) snails, and these TMIIs were additive. By causing Nucella to consume fewer barnacles, crab predation risk allowed fucoids that had settled on or between barnacles to remain in the community. Hence, positive interactions between barnacles and algae caused crab–algae TMIIs to be strongest when both consumers were present. Studies of TMIIs in more realistic, reticulate food webs will be necessary for a more complete understanding of how predation risk shapes community dynamics.",W2603614123,True,0.9819585680961609

Other species gained access to baits 12 times more often and were only able to take over baits when phorids were present. Furthermore, many more species (13 versus 2) gained access to resources when phorids were present. These results indicate that phorids mediate competitive interactions between ant species and may influence ant communities by affecting resource availability.

https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12413,Using plant functional traits to restore Hawaiian rainforest,"Ecosystem restoration efforts are carried out by a variety of individuals and organizations with an equally varied set of goals, priorities, resources and time-scales. Once restoration of a degraded landscape or community is recognized as necessary, choosing which species to include in a restoration programme can be a difficult and value-laden process (Fry, Power & Manning 2013; Jones 2013). Species choice in restoration is often carried out with limited ecological information, particularly in regard to species interactions, successional processes and resource-use patterns. Selecting species can be particularly problematic in systems where there is no available baseline data on historical communities, or when restoration to a historic state is not feasible for ecological, logistic or economic reasons. In such cases, it may be preferable to focus on restoring site 'functionality' rather than returning to a historic baseline composition. We present a method for species selection in restoration, based on the collection of plant functional trait data. Using this method, managers can develop species mixtures with desired properties, including expected predictions of interspecific interactions and potential changes in biotic and abiotic conditions. To illustrate this approach, we present a case study in Hawaiian lowland wet forests (HLWF) in which plant species for a restoration project were chosen based on their functional traits, in order to help land managers achieve their restoration goals while at the same time allowing researchers to better understand invasion resistance and ecosystem functioning. In our case, our choices led to the development of hybrid ecosystems including both native and introduced species. However, the approach that we present is not limited to novel or hybrid ecosystem creation, because the candidate species examined and functional traits measured are determined by the user. Whereas restoration usually implies a return to historic conditions, there is also growing attention to what some authors have called 'intervention ecology' (sensu Hobbs et al. 2011). This view emphasizes maintaining ecosystem services and functions (Hobbs et al. 2011). The contrast between these frameworks has been widely debated in the literature, and we do not intend to advocate the merit of one view over the other here. Rather, we present the logic behind a functional trait approach, describe why its use is feasible in a Hawaiian lowland forest and present a step-by-step approach to the method that can be applied to a wide variety of ecological systems. While we readily acknowledge that in our study system, we cannot return to a pre-human state, we still consider our approach 'restoration' in a broad sense. Functional trait theory holds that characteristics or traits of each species reflect their resource use and life-history trade-offs (Reich 2014). A body of evidence shows that plant traits vary continuously, in predictable ways, along resource availability gradients – suggesting that species' functional traits can be linked to ecosystem properties and to ecosystem services (Lavorel 2013). Many studies have suggested that a robust image of a species' functional profile can be obtained by considering traits related to resource acquisition (e.g. foliar nitrogen, leaf area), resource limitation (e.g. midday leaf water potential, δ13C-integrated water-use efficiency, leaf mass per area), reproductive investment (e.g. height, seed mass, dispersal type) and resource allocation patterns (e.g. leaf mass per area, specific root length, wood density) (Drenovsky & James 2010; Douma et al. 2012; Sonnier et al. 2012; Fry, Power & Manning 2013). For restoration, selecting species with certain functional trait values can influence species interactions (including competition) and ecosystem properties (Suding et al. 2008). For example, if creating a more fire-tolerant community is necessary, practitioners could select species that increase fine-fuel loads or species whose presence will favour succession from forest to grassland. Other considerations relevant to managers include importance to local wildlife, ability to serve as nurse logs, nitrogen-fixing properties, etc. The Hawaiian archipelago offers a unique setting for testing novel approaches to applied ecological questions. On one hand, Hawai'i is considered a model system for ecological research because of the combination of well-defined biotic and abiotic gradients with extreme examples of adaptive radiation (Vitousek 2004). On the other hand, like many isolated oceanic islands, the Hawaiian Islands have been extremely vulnerable to invasion and anthropogenic disturbance. The combination of simplicity and susceptibility presents a distinctive platform for conservation research. Hawaiian lowland wet forests in particular present serious challenges for restoration and conservation. This forest type only exists as remnant patches, is always populated by invasive plant and animal species, and occurs near human habitation, where non-native propagule pressure is likely to be high (Zimmerman et al. 2008). In such ecosystems, it is important to recognize that not all non-native species are equally problematic. For example, many Polynesian introductions in Hawai'i have persisted in the landscape for up to 1000 years without becoming invasive. In addition to being culturally important, many non-invasive, non-native species have functional trait values, which are not present in the native flora. Breadfruit and coconut are two species that fit both of these criteria: they are not classified as invasive, and they have large leaves and seeds, unlike most native plants. From a restoration perspective, we aimed to test the hypothesis that designing communities with greater diversity of functional trait expression will lead to more invasion-resistant communities (Funk et al. 2008; Drenovsky & James 2010). To do so, we examined the functional traits of species using multivariate analysis; the technique projects each species to a specific x,y location in 'trait space,' which should reflect that species' functional profile. Our restoration experiment was carried out at the Keaukaha Military Reservation (KMR) within the municipality of Hilo. This site retains a HLWF, which has a canopy that contains significant numbers of native tree species; however, it also has a long history of disturbance, and invasive trees represent up to half of the basal area (Ostertag et al. 2009). A previous removal experiment in this forest has shown that removal of invasive species alone is not enough to get a native forest back, despite its positive influence on seedling recruitment of native species (Cordell et al. 2009; Ostertag et al. 2009). Given current conditions, the forest is poised to lose most of its native species and become like most of the forest patches remaining in the lowlands – almost exclusively non-native dominated. The trait-based method we used employs five steps. We illustrate the method's use in HLWF; however, it need not include the use of non-native species, and it is exportable to other ecosystems. Land managers at KMR are charged with specific targets developed by the US military. These are as follows: (i) conserving and encouraging the regeneration of native biodiversity at the site, (ii) controlling invasive species and (iii) encouraging carbon storage on the landscape. Because restoring this area to an all-native ecosystem is no longer economically feasible, we elected to create hybrid ecosystems. Our experimental communities were assembled using species whose combined functional trait profiles addressed these three management goals to meet restoration objectives of the main stakeholders. We had two main considerations for choosing the traits on which to base our species selection. First, we wanted to estimate the 'functional role' or 'strategy' (sensu Reich 2014) of different species within HLWF environments, and secondly, we wanted to identify specific traits that would address our restoration objectives. We first looked at the overall distribution of HLWF species in trait space and then focused on how different species expressed particular traits that were relevant to our restoration objectives. The functional traits measured (Table 1) were derived from literature and field data. We included traits that are informative in the ecological context of HLWF. For example, knowing that light (rather than nutrient or water availability) is the primary limiting resource for native species in this forest (Ostertag et al. 2009), we included a suite of traits related to light capture (as well as canopy and understorey architecture; including leaf : petiole ratio, plant height and canopy shape). Many of the traits we measured are informative of more than one aspect of a plant species' ecological strategy, and some traits can be used as proxies for others, which are more difficult to measure. For example, we included both maximum plant height and seed mass as proxies for dispersal distance (see Thomson et al. 2011). The potential species pool included native species thought to have been present at the site historically, native species currently found at the site and non-native species already found in the region that are believed to pose low invasion risk. To address the latter, we based our decisions on the Hawaiian Weed Risk Assessment score (Daehler et al. 2004; see In a past study at KMR, woody species richness was nine native species and 10 introduced species (Zimmerman et al. 2008). Due to a lack of formal records of species occurrence and poor pollen preservation, it is difficult to ascertain which species would have been found historically in any given area of HLWF. Because we suspect that some native species once found at KMR have been locally extirpated, we cast a wide net in order to determine which species could potentially be used for restoring the forest. We included native species with similar environmental requirements that could have occurred in HLWF, based on historical range descriptions by Wagner, Herbst & Sohmer (1999) and previous field experience. Once the list of potential species was compiled (including 17 non-native and 19 native species), we eliminated species which were too difficult to sample or propagate, and species for which sufficient data were not available – reducing our pool to 16 native species and 15 non-native species. Other limiting factors that practitioners should consider include economics (e.g. cost of seeds, plants, labour or time), logistics (e.g. availability of species, project or budget timelines), resilience to climatic change or disturbance regimes, as well as the goals and expectations of stakeholders. We sampled plant traits across the full range of conditions in which HLWF is found regionally in order to account for both site and environmental heterogeneity. In total, we sampled traits at 25 sites throughout east Hawai'i Island, in addition to using existing data from the literature. By far, the most time-consuming and effort-consuming steps in making species choices by using traits are creating the potential species pool and collecting trait data. However, compilations of trait data are increasingly common world-wide. A variety of data sets are available either directly from researchers and agencies involved in the region (e.g. the Australian Virtual Herbarium) or from collaborative data base compilations (e.g. TRY ( DRYAD ( or LEDA ( Once the trait data were assembled, we grouped the information for each trait into quartiles in order to account for both analytical constraints and the nature of trait data. Because we considered both multiple traits and multiple species, making meaningful comparisons was often challenging. For example, measures of seed mass spanned many orders of magnitude from <0·001 to 576 g, while the maximum difference in leaf thickness measured no more than 0·4 mm (Table 1). Furthermore, sometimes it is necessary to compare ratios and categories to numerical data. The use of quartiles places more importance on the relative differences in trait values. This approach emphasizes species which are 'outliers' rather than species that display the 'middle range' (i.e. the most or least effective water use vs. the species whose values are nearest to the group mean). This type of data manipulation is appropriate to the multivariate ordination analysis we later employ. We used a principal components analysis (PCA) to show how the selected species are arranged, relative to one another, in trait space and to provide an idea of each species' functional profile. Other multivariate techniques could be substituted. An important outcome of the PCA was the prominent separation of native and non-native species in distinct areas of the graph, primarily based on leaf mass per area, carbon : nitrogen ratio and foliar nitrogen (Fig. 1a). This result reinforces that species in Hawai'i with different biogeographic origins are functionally divergent. Hawaiian species tend to be conservative in regard to growth and nutrient acquisition, whereas the non-native species tend towards faster life-history strategies. Carbon turnover rates are substantially higher in invasive-dominated communities than they are in native plant communities (Hughes et al. 2014). With this in mind, we ran an additional PCA using only traits associated with carbon cycling (including specific gravity, foliar chemistry and maximum plant height) to find which species from our pool have the greatest likelihood of slow rates of carbon turnover (Fig. 1b). We identified two groups of four 'core species' whose trait profiles indicate either slow or moderate carbon turnover, and then located these core species on the first (general) PCA of all species traits (Fig. 1a). Based on Euclidian distances within the general PCA, we determined a centroid point equidistant from all four species in each group and then selected groups of additional species that were closer (i.e. most similar and potentially most redundant) and furthest (i.e. least similar and potentially most complementary) to each centroid (Fig. 1c). The motivation for this selection was that we are trying to determine whether combinations of species whose traits are more dissimilar (complementary) or similar (redundant) confer greater invasion resistance in the hybrid forests (Funk et al. 2008). Once species are displayed in trait space, a variety of decisions can be made based on their relative functional profiles. While our process included two PCAs, for some restoration objectives, decisions could be made with only one (Fig. 1a). In our case, pragmatic and logistical concerns were addressed at this point. For example, one of our species was removed, because although it was culturally important, and functionally a good fit, it is unable to maintain itself without direct, ongoing human intervention. Alternatively, when several species proved to be functionally similar, final species choice was based on pragmatic considerations such as seedling cost, availability within given time frames or projected time to maturity. In short, the process allows for an unbiased way to let the data dictate a first step, and then, the practical concerns of practitioners can be layered onto the final species choices. To date, multiple studies have evaluated the role of functional traits in ecosystems and/or been carried out in controlled settings and relatively simple ecosystems such as grasslands (Drenovsky & James 2010; Fry, Power & Manning 2013; Lavorel 2013). We show that a trait-based approach can also be used in a tropical forest system. Because the metrics are based on site-specific restoration objectives, this approach is generalizable, flexible and transferable across ecosystems and taxa. Once refined, the approach can be applied with relatively little effort by managers. We named our project Liko Nā Pilina, which translates loosely to 'the budding new relationships', to emphasize the developing associations among the species, and the intertwining of fundamental science questions and the practical needs of land managers faced with a formidable task made more daunting by lack of information on how to achieve their restoration goals. While it is too early to determine if the treatments met our objectives, results 1 year after planting show >90% survival of outplants and increased seedling recruitment by native species. By creating hybrid ecosystems using both native and non-native species (many of which are culturally significant), the project melds together traditional and contemporary approaches to forest management. This has proved attractive to the general public, school groups and summer programmes, allowing us to tap into an eager set of volunteers. In our experience, the level of community engagement is unusual for science-based restoration experiments. Thus, this new type of restoration can fulfil many goals, providing a rigorous way to choose species for restoration as well as providing a simple framework that is appealing to local communities.

The present article investigates beyond the pairwise competitive interactions and provides a novel perspective for understanding the influence of higher-order interactions on the evolution of social phenotypes. Our simple model yields a prosperous outlook to demonstrate the impact of perturbations on intransitive competitive higher-order interactions. Using a mathematical technique, we show how alone the perturbed interaction network can quickly determine the coexistence equilibrium of competing species instead of solving a large system of ordinary differential equations. It is possible to split the system into multiple feasible cluster states depending on the number of perturbations. Our analysis also reveals that the ratio between the unperturbed and perturbed species is inversely proportional to the amount of employed perturbation. Our results suggest that nonlinear dynamical systems and interaction topologies can be interplayed to comprehend species' coexistence under adverse conditions.

Phenotypic traits that consistently mediate species' responses to environmental variation (functional traits) provide a promising approach toward generalizing ecological and evolutionary patterns and thereby gaining insights into the processes generating them. In the plant functional ecology literature, most trait-based studies have focused on traits mediating either resource competition or responses to variation in the abiotic environment, while traits mediating reproductive interactions have often been neglected.Methodology. Here, I discuss the value of herkogamy, the spatial separation of male and female functions in flowers, as a functional trait in plant reproductive biology and review the evidence relevant to the hypothesis that taxa exhibiting greater herkogamy have historically experienced more reliable pollination and more outcrossed mating systems.Pivotal results. A large body of work in the field of plant reproductive biology has identified a set of nearly ubiquitous correlations between average herkogamy and features of plant mating systems, notably, autofertility (seed set in the absence of pollinators) and outcrossing rate. Herkogamy often varies extensively among populations and species, and the adaptive interpretation is that herkogamy exhibits local adaptation to the reliability of the pollination environment.Conclusions. These results underline the value of herkogamy as a functional trait representing variation in mating histories. Many important insights are likely to emerge from studies leveraging herkogamy as an easily measured proxy of plant mating systems, as already demonstrated in comparative studies and studies of reproductive interactions. Greater consideration of herkogamy and other reproductive-function traits in studies of species coexistence may provide a more complete understanding of community assembly processes.",W2896731564,True,0.989287257194519
https://doi.org/10.2307/177114,Trait-Mediated Indirect Effects in Larval Anurans: Reversing Competition with the Threat of Predation,"Ecologists recently have been focusing on the role that trait-mediated indirect effects can have on community structure and composition. To date, this work has primarily focused on the effects of predator-induced behavioral plasticity on communities. However, predator-induced morphological plasticity, which has been documented in many taxa, might also lead to trait-mediated indirect effects. Here, I examined how predators altered the behavior and morphology of larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and leopard frogs (R. pipiens) and how these phenotypic changes altered the outcome of competition between the two species. Competition in the absence of caged predators was asymmetric; when reared separately, leopard frogs grew more than wood frogs, but when competing (without predators), wood frogs grew faster than leopard frogs. The presence of caged predators reversed the outcome of competition between the two anuran prey. In the presence of larval dragonflies (Anax spp.) or caged mudminnows (Umbra limi), leopard frogs grew faster than wood frogs while total tadpole biomass production remained unchanged. Thus, there was a predator-mediated indirect effect. Because predators alter both the behavior and morphology of larval anurans and both of these traits are known to affect resource consumption and growth, both are potential mechanisms to explain the change in competitive outcome. Changes in behavior were not related to changes in growth, but changes in morphology (specifically mouth width and tail length) were related to changes in growth. When competitors were added (without predators), wood frogs increased their mouth width by 10% and their tail length by 3%, while leopard frogs increased their mouth width by 5% and did not change their tail length. The greater increase in mouth width for wood frogs should increase their forage intake, since tadpoles feed by scraping periphyton; the importance of a 3% longer tail in competitive ability is unknown. The presence of the predator threat (via chemical cues from the caged predators) reduced both the mouth width and tail length in the two prey species to pre-competition levels. This response corresponded with the reduced competitive ability of the wood frogs. This work demonstrates that both competitors and predators can alter prey morphology and suggests that changes in morphology can cause trait-mediated indirect effects.",W4205088947,True,0.9956339001655579
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2003563,Contrasting impacts of competition on ecological and social trait evolution in songbirds,"Competition between closely related species has long been viewed as a powerful selective force that drives trait diversification, thereby generating phenotypic diversity over macroevolutionary timescales. However, although the impact of interspecific competition has been documented in a handful of iconic insular radiations, most previous studies have focused on traits involved in resource use, and few have examined the role of competition across large, continental radiations. Thus, the extent to which broad-scale patterns of phenotypic diversity are shaped by competition remain largely unclear, particularly for social traits. Here, we estimate the effect of competition between interacting lineages by applying new phylogenetic models that account for such interactions to an exceptionally complete dataset of resource-use traits and social signaling traits for the entire radiation of tanagers (Aves, Thraupidae), the largest family of songbirds. We find that interspecific competition strongly influences the evolution of traits involved in resource use, with a weaker effect on plumage signals, and very little effect on song. Our results provide compelling evidence that interspecific exploitative competition contributes to ecological trait diversification among coexisting species, even in a large continental radiation. In comparison, signal traits mediating mate choice and social competition seem to diversify under different evolutionary models, including rapid diversification in the allopatric stage of speciation.",W2785617100,True,0.9780389070510864
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2564,Mistletoe generates non‐trophic and trait‐mediated indirect interactions through a shared host of herbivore consumers,"Abstract Indirect interactions emerge among a wide range of herbivores sharing the same plant resource. Consumers usually belong to different trophic guilds, from folivores and sapsuckers to parasitic plants. We propose that mistletoes parasitizing pines could play a key role acting as herbivores on host pines and coming indirectly into competition with other herbivores feeding on the same host. Changes caused by mistletoes on its host have been well studied, but its effects running across trophic webs remain unrevealed. In this study, we investigate the effect of European mistletoe ( Viscum album subsp. austriacum ) on the host‐feeding herbivores via trait‐mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) across their shared pine host ( Pinus nigra subsp. salzmannii ). We performed field and laboratory experiments, and analyzed the net effect of different mistletoe parasite loads on three host‐phytophagous species: the sapsucker Cinara pini (Aphididae), the winter folivore Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Thaumetopoeidae), and the summer folivore Brachyderes sp. (Curculionidae), all being members of different functional feeding groups (FFGs). We summarize the mistletoe–host–herbivore interactions by means of a TMII, where mistletoe parasitism causes non‐trophic links and detrimental indirect interactions on pine‐feeding herbivores across its shared host, suggesting a worsening of host quality as food. These indirect interactions vary according to three parameters. First, the intensity has a non‐proportional relation with parasite load, showing an impact threshold on highly parasitized pines. Second, the movement capacity of insect herbivores determines their response, by decreasing the abundance of herbivores with low movement ability (aphids and pine processionary caterpillars) while altering the behavior (plant selection) of more mobile herbivores (pine weevils). Finally, FFG determines the intensity of mistletoe parasitism effects, folivores being more responsive than sapsuckers. Overall, mistletoe generates non‐trophic interaction linkages in the forest able to modify community structure by becoming a nexus of the entire herbivore community of the pine canopy.",W2921991496,True,0.9836735129356384
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13378,From apparent competition to facilitation: Impacts of consumer niche construction on the coexistence and stability of consumer‐resource communities,"Abstract In addition to their direct trophic effects, some consumers have a positive indirect effect on their resource, due to niche construction. A predator can facilitate its prey resource acquisition, through prey transport, or through modifications of nutrient cycling. Alternatively, a predator may defend its prey against other predators, or actively manage it, as in agriculture, which is found in numerous taxa such as humans, ants, beetles, fishes and microbes. Here, we investigate the ecological consequences of considering such positive effects in a simple two‐resource–one‐consumer module, in which the consumer has a positive effect on one of the resources. We consider several scenarios, in which the positive effect on the resource is either not costly, that is resulting from a by‐product of the consumer phenotype such as nutrient cycling, or costly. The cost either decreases the exploitation of the cultivated resource or the opportunity to forage the alternative resource. We investigate how the intensity of niche construction impacts species coexistence, the distribution of biomass among the three species and the stability of the community. We show that by modifying the trophic interactions in the module, niche construction alters the apparent competition between the resources, thereby impacting their coexistence. When niche construction has little or no cost to the consumer, it leads to higher consumer and cultivated resource densities, while decreasing the alternative resource density. Alternatively, when niche construction has higher costs, the alternative resource can increase in density, niche construction thereby leading to the emergence of facilitative interactions among resource species.

https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.0504,Trait-mediated competition drives an ant invasion and alters functional diversity,"The assumption that differences in species' traits reflect their different niches has long influenced how ecologists infer processes from assemblage patterns. For instance, many assess the importance of environmental filtering versus classical limiting-similarity competition in driving biological invasions by examining whether invaders’ traits are similar or dissimilar to those of residents, respectively. However, mounting evidence suggests that hierarchical differences between species' trait values can distinguish their competitive abilities (e.g. for the same resource) instead of their niches. Whether such trait-mediated hierarchical competition explains invasions and structures assemblages is less explored. We integrate morphological, dietary, physiological and behavioural trait analyses to test whether environmental filtering, limiting-similarity competition or hierarchical competition explain invasions by fire ants on ant assemblages. We detect both competition mechanisms; invasion success is not only explained by limiting similarity in body size and thermal tolerance (presumably allowing the invader to exploit different niches from residents), but also by the invader's superior position in trait hierarchies reflecting competition for common trophic resources. We find that the two mechanisms generate complex assemblage-level functional diversity patterns—overdispersion in some traits, clustering in others—suggesting their effects are likely missed by analyses restricted to a few traits and composite trait diversity measures.",W4283709393,True,0.9622019529342651

Leaf pubescence has been repeatedly shown to mediate predator-herbivore interactions whereas the influence of leaf pubescence on predator–predator interactions such as intraguild predation (IGP) has seldom been investigated. Using a three-pronged approach we assessed the influence of leaf pubescence on the predatory mites Kampimodromus aberrans and Euseius finlandicus. Both predators occur on broad-leaved trees in Europe. Euseius finlandicus is mostly found on trees with glabrous leaves whereas K. aberrans mainly occurs on trees with pubescent leaves. We hypothesized that leaf pubescence mediates IGP between K. aberrans and E. finlandicus and thereby determines their dominance and proportional abundance. A field survey on apple revealed that the abundance of K. aberrans and E. finlandicus is negatively correlated, with the former predominating on cultivars with strongly pubescent leaves and the latter predominating on cultivars with little pubescent or glabrous leaves. Microhabitat choice tests showed that K. aberrans preferentially resides on pubescent leaves whereas E. finlandicus preferentially resides on glabrous leaves. The effects of leaf pubescence on survival and development of immature IG predators and IG prey were reversed for K. aberrans and E. finlandicus. In the presence of the IG predator E. finlandicus, immature K. aberrans had higher survival probabilities on pubescent leaves than on glabrous ones. In contrast, the survival chances of immature E. finlandicus were higher on glabrous leaves than on pubescent ones when the IG predator K. aberrans was present. Artificial leaf pubescence enhanced IG prey capture by immature K. aberrans and prolonged their longevity but impaired IG prey capture by immature E. finlandicus and shortened their longevity. We conclude that leaf pubescence mediates IGP strength and symmetry and discuss the implications to natural and biological control.",W4230221898,True,0.9731405973434448
https://doi.org/10.1890/04-1136,ECOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF A RESOURCE POLYMORPHISM IN ZENAIDA DOVES OF BARBADOS,"Despite the important place of resource polymorphisms in ecological and evolutionary theories, the reason why a group of individuals sharing a common environment should diverge in the use of the resources remains poorly known. Given the existence of distinct open niches and the relaxation of interspecific competition, niche theory suggests two possible mechanisms: resource competition between conspecifics and trade-offs in resource use efficiency. We investigated the importance of these explanations in a foraging polymorphism recently developed by Zenaida Doves (Zenaida aurita) on the West Indian island of Barbados. In this polymorphism, individuals either aggressively defend feeding territories from conspecifics or feed in large unaggressive groups with conspecifics. Combining field observations and a cage experiment, we found no evidence that the polymorphism is primarily driven by age- or sex-related differences, or that it results from morphological feeding specializations or dietary preferences. Instead, our results support the hypothesis that individual specializations arise from contest competition. In the study area, competition for territories was intense, with very little undefended space left between territories and owners frequently involved in territorial contests. Replacement of territory holders from year to year was low compared to the number of potential recruits, implying that many doves were incapable of securing a territory. Approximately half the doves at territorial sites did not hold a territory but wandered between them as floaters. Compared with territory holders, floaters were smaller and had shorter wings, traits that in this species mediate territory defense. Yet floaters did not differ from group feeding doves on these morphological traits. This suggests that group feeders are floaters that shift to an alternative resource. The new resource appears to be suboptimal, as indicated by the fact that group feeders were in worse body condition than doves from the territorial sites. Taken together, our results suggest that the resource polymorphism in Zenaida Doves is primarily driven by competition for territories, which forces less competitive individuals to use alternative, subobtimal resources.",W2108436819,True,0.9884876608848572
https://doi.org/10.1890/04-0719,SCARED TO DEATH? THE EFFECTS OF INTIMIDATION AND CONSUMPTION IN PREDATOR–PREY INTERACTIONS,"Predation is a central feature of ecological communities. Most theoretical and empirical studies of predation focus on the consequences of predators consuming their prey. Predators reduce prey population densities through direct consumption (a density-mediated interaction, DMI), a process that may indirectly affect the prey's resources, competitors, and other predators. However, predators can also affect prey population density by stimulating costly defensive strategies. The costs of these defensive strategies can include reduced energy income, energetic investment in defensive structures, lower mating success, increased vulnerability to other predators, or emigration. Theoretical and empirical studies confirm the existence of these induced costs (trait-mediated interactions, TMIs); however, the relative importance of intimidation (TMI) and consumption (DMI) effects remains an open question. We conducted a meta-analysis assessing the magnitude of both TMIs and DMIs in predator–prey interactions. On average, the impact of intimidation on prey demographics was at least as strong as direct consumption (63% and 51% the size of the total predator effect, respectively). This contrast is even more pronounced when we consider the cascading effects of predators on their prey's resources: density effects attenuated through food chains, while TMIs remained strong, rising to 85% of the total predator effect. Predators can thus strongly influence resource density even if they consume few prey items. Finally, intimidation was more important in aquatic than terrestrial ecosystems. Our results suggest that the costs of intimidation, traditionally ignored in predator–prey ecology, may actually be the dominant facet of trophic interactions.",W2108031508,True,0.9757604598999023
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007423,Species-Specific Traits Rather Than Resource Partitioning Mediate Diversity Effects on Resource Use,"Background The link between biodiversity and ecosystem processes has firmly been established, but the mechanisms underpinning this relationship are poorly documented. Most studies have focused on terrestrial plant systems where resource use can be difficult to quantify as species rely on a limited number of common resources. Investigating resource use at the bulk level may not always be of sufficient resolution to detect subtle differences in resource use, as species-specific nutritional niches at the biochemical level may also moderate diversity effects on resource use. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we use three co-occurring marine benthic echinoderms (Brissopsis lyrifera, Mesothuria intestinalis, Parastichopus tremulus) that feed on the same phytodetrital food source, to determine whether resource partitioning is the principal mechanism underpinning diversity effects on resource use. Specifically we investigate the use of phytodetrital pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) because many of these are essential for biological functions, including reproduction. Pigments were identified and quantified using reverse-phase high performance liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and data were analysed using a combination of extended linear regression with generalised least squares (GLS) estimation and standard multivariate techniques. Our analyses reveal no species-specific selectivity for particular algal pigments, confirming that these three species do not partition food resources at the biochemical level. Nevertheless, we demonstrate increased total resource use in diverse treatments as a result of selection effects and the dominance of one species (B. lyrifera). Conclusion Overall, we found no evidence for resource partitioning at the biochemical level, as pigment composition was similar between individuals, which is likely due to plentiful food availability. Reduced intra-specific competition in the species mixture combined with greater adsorption efficiency and differences in feeding behaviour likely explain the dominant use of resources by B. lyrifera.",W2010454319,True,0.9644992351531982

When predation levels are high, this apparent competition can culminate in a prey species being displaced. Coupling quantitative genetics and Lotka-Volterra models, we study how predator evolution alters this and other ecological outcomes. These models account for a trade-off between the predator's attack rates on two prey species. We provide a mathematical characterization of a strong form of persistence--permanence--for which there is a global attractor bounded away from extinction. When the evolutionary dynamics occur at a sufficiently slower time scale than the ecological dynamics, we also characterize attractors and their basins' of attraction using singular perturbation theory and a graphical approach to the eco-evolutionary dynamics. Our results show that eco-evolutionary feedbacks can mediate permanence at intermediate trade-offs in the attack rates. However, at strong trade-offs, permanence is lost. Despite this loss of permanence, there can be attractors supporting coexistence. These attractors, however, may coincide with attractors at which the predator is excluded. Our results highlight that evo-evolutionary feedbacks can alter community structure by mediating coexistence or leading to trait-dependent alternative stable states.",W2949425566,True,0.9933124780654907

Predators may increase lower trophic levels (bacteria) by reducing density of bacteriovores, by altering behavior of bacteriovores, and by processing living bacteriovores into carcasses, feces, and dissolved nutrients that are substrates for bacteria. We tested these pathways in laboratory experiments with mosquitoes in water‐filled containers. Larval Toxorhynchites rutilus prey on larval Aedes triseriatus, which feed on bacteria. Using containers stocked with oak leaf infusion as a bacterial substrate, we compared bacterial productivity at 7 and 14 days for: prey alone; prey with a predator; and prey with predation cues but no predator. Controls contained no larvae, either with predation cues or without cues. Predation cues in the control treatment increased bacterial abundance at 7 days, but this effect waned by 14 days. Aedes triseriatus larvae reduced bacterial abundance significantly at 14 days. Predator cues and real predation both eliminated the negative effect of A. triseriatus on bacterial abundance. Predation cues reduced survivorship of A. triseriatus larvae at 14 days, however this effect was smaller than the effect of real predation. We further tested effects of residues from predation as cues or as detritus in a second experiment in which A. triseriatus were killed at similar rates by: real predators ; mechanical damage without the predator and carcasses left as detritus; or mechanical damage and carcasses removed. No prey larvae were killed in controls. Bacterial productivity was greater with real predation than in all other treatments and greater when prey larvae were killed or killed and removed, than in controls. Thus we find evidence that all three pathways contribute to the trophic cascade from T. rutilus to bacteria in tree hole systems.",W2080441584,True,0.9591690301895142

While often modelled as a two-species interaction between host and parasite, some systems are more complex due to effects of host enemies, intraguild predation, and endosymbionts, all of which affect host immunity. However, it remains unclear how these factors, combined with genetic variation in the host and the parasitoid, affect host immunity. We address this question in an important agricultural pest system, the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, which shows significant intraspecific variability in immunity to the parasitoid wasp Aphidius ervi. In a complex experiment, we use a quantitative genetic design in the parasitoid, two ecologically different aphid lineages and the aphid lion Chrysoperla carnea as an intraguild predator to unravel the complex interdependencies. We demonstrate that aphid immunity as a key trait of this complex host-parasite system is affected by intraspecific genetic variation in the parasitoid and the aphid, the interaction of intraspecific genetic variation with intraguild predation, and differences in defensive endosymbionts between aphid lineages. Further, aphid lineages differ in their altruistic behaviour whereby infested aphids move away from the clonal colony to facilitate predation. Our findings provide new insights into the influence of endosymbiosis and genetic variability in an important host-parasitoid system which is influenced by natural enemies of the parasitoid and the aphid, including its endosymbiont communities. We show that endosymbiosis can mediate or influence the evolutionary arms race between aphids and their natural enemies.

The intensity of intra‐ and interspecific competition for dung as a breeding resource is substantially higher in WA. First, we tested whether differential resource competition in the two exotic ranges is associated with divergences in life history traits, which impact on resource use. We predicted that high levels of resource competition in WA should favor females that produce brood balls more efficiently and of altered size, and produce offspring more readily when a breeding opportunity arises. Furthermore, we predicted that larvae from WA populations may have evolved more efficient development and thus exhibit higher eclosion success, shorter development time, and altered body size under standardized conditions. Second, we examined the likely developmental mechanisms underlying these divergences, that is, genetic differentiation, developmental plasticity, or parental effects in a common garden experiment. Field‐collected EUS and WA populations significantly differed, as predicted, in most of the traits examined. However, these differences are facilitated by a complex combination of proximate mechanisms. Developmental plasticity and (grand) parental effects mediated differences related to reproductive performance, whereas genetic differentiation mediated differences in the duration of larval development. Our study highlights that population divergences can be the product of a patchwork of proximate mechanisms, with each mechanism adjusting different traits in a way that the resulting composite phenotype may be better suited to its competitive environment.",W1830272747,True,0.901552140712738

However, to what extent does the distribution of trait variation among ecological scales differ between leaf and wood tissues and between physical and chemical traits? What are the consequences of resource competition and/or habitat filtering on the community assembly with respect to differences between leaf and wood traits, and between physical and chemical traits? Location Subtropical evergreen broad‐leaved forests in five sites in the Ningbo area (29°41–50′ N, 121°36–52′ E) in eastern China. Methods Traits of 96 woody plant species were sampled and variation of ten physical‐ and chemical‐based leaf and wood traits were partitioned across six ecological scales (site, plot, species, individual plant, twigs and leaf age) using a linear mixed model. Results From individual plant to site scales, variance partitions were distinct between leaf and wood traits. In leaf tissues, physical and chemical traits showed a consistent pattern, with the majority of variation found among species and individual plants, with little among plots. For wood tissues, the largest variation in physical traits was at the species and individual plant scales, with the largest variation in chemical traits observed at the plot scale. Variance partition was markedly similar within and across species. Conclusion Leaf and wood traits vary differently in relation to ecological scale, suggesting that trait variability is tissue‐specific. The large variability of wood traits at the plot scale suggests a strong habitat filtering process. The large variation in leaf traits within plots may reflect niche differentiation across species and the importance of intra‐specific variation that affects species co‐existence. Our study demonstrated that physical and chemical traits may be independent. These decoupled trait axes may increase the dimensionality of niche space and facilitate species co‐existence in forest communities.",W2164897642,True,0.9258151054382324

Female common lizards display a polymorphism in ventral colour correlated with differences in reproduction, dispersal, and susceptibility to resource competition. We tested the hypothesis that this polymorphism is correlated with differences in behaviour in a social context. We studied the agonistic behaviour (aggression and avoidance) and social stress of females of different colours during laboratory-staged encounters with a limiting resource. We found that the behaviour of females was affected by their own colour, or the colour of their opponent, or both. Such alternative behavioural patterns might reflect differences in competitive ability. Orange females were the least aggressive and the most likely to avoid social interactions, and thus could be a weaker competitor. Yellow females were rarely exposed to aggression and often made their opponents flee, and thus might have higher resource-holding potential. Mixed females were aggressive but were also often exposed to aggression, and displayed the highest stress level, which could be characteristic of an intermediate or condition-dependent resource-holding potential. The possibility that ventral colour is used in social interactions to signal resource-holding potential is discussed.RésuméChez le lézard vivipare, la compétition pour les ressources entre femelles est probablement une pression de sélection forte, qui pourrait avoir favorisé l'évolution de signaux visibles. Les femelles lézards vivipares présentent un polymorphisme de couleur ventrale, corrélé à des différences au niveau de la reproduction, de la dispersion, et de la sensibilité à la compétition pour les ressources. Nous avons testé l'hypothèse que ce polymorphisme est corrélé à des différences de comportement dans un contexte social. Nous avons étudié le comportement agonistique (agression et évitement) et le stress social de femelles de différentes couleurs au cours de confrontations en laboratoire en présence d'une ressource limitante. Nous avons trouvé que le comportement des femelles était influencé par leur propre couleur, celle de la femelle opposante, ou l'interaction des deux. Une telle variation comportementale pourrait refléter des différences individuelles de potentiel compétitif. L'un des morphes de couleur était le moins agressif et le plus enclin à éviter les interactions sociales, il pourrait donc être le moins compétitif. Au contraire, un autre morphe était rarement agressé et provoquait souvent la fuite de son opposant, il pourrait avoir un fort potentiel compétitif. Enfin, le troisième morphe était agressif, mais également souvent agressé, et montrait le plus haut niveau de stress social, ce qui pourrait être caractéristique d'un potentiel compétitif intermédiaire ou dépendant de la condition. Nous discutons de la possibilité que la couleur ventrale soit utilisée dans les interactions sociales pour signaler le potentiel compétitif des individus.Keywords: laboratory-staged encountersresource holding potentialsignalssocial competitionMots-clés: compétition socialeconfrontations en laboratoirepotentiel compétitifsignaux",W2140912150,True,0.9802214503288269
https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.13023,Fine‐root and mycorrhizal traits help explain ecosystem processes and responses to global change,"'Root systems of perennial plants possess a high degree of complexity and the first step to understanding this complexity is to realize that not all roots and root systems are the same.' In this report, we discuss two key themes that emerged from the International Symposium on Critical Zone Biochemistry and Belowground Ecological Research. First, we discuss the need to identify broad patterns of root and mycorrhizal trait variation, both across and within species, as an effective means to understand and predict variation in function across species and sites, and through time. Second, we assert that, to fully understand the role roots and mycorrhizal fungi play in ecosystem processes, a broader perspective that relates their function to both short-term activity (e.g. acquisition of soil resources) and long-term changes in ecosystem function and community composition is required. Finally, we emphasize the need for a global effort in root and mycorrhizal research to synchronize methods of data collection and sharing for more powerful comparisons of belowground activity. Linking plant traits with function has been a valuable approach for understanding plant systems, particularly above ground, where traits including xylem anatomy, leaf mass per unit area, and leaf nitrogen (N) content often serve as indicators of plant hydraulic conductance, leaf lifespan, and photosynthetic capacity, respectively. Below ground, wide variation in both root and mycorrhizal traits has been observed (Fig. 1) and linking this trait variation to ecosystem processes was a common theme during much of the meeting. More broadly, developing greater appreciation of root and mycorrhizal function across species and environments greatly enhances understanding of whole-ecosystem processes, as roots and soil fungi have been identified as key drivers of C and nutrient cycling in terrestrial systems (Ostonen et al., 2011; Iversen et al., 2012; Clemmensen et al., 2013). Root systems of perennial plants possess a high degree of complexity and the first step to understanding this complexity is to realize that not all roots and root systems are the same. Even among distal, first-order roots, pioneer and fibrous roots maintain morphological differences at birth that are intrinsically linked to their function (Zadworny & Eissenstat, 2011). These and other differences in root anatomy, morphology, and physiology among and within species often relate to differences in root function (Fig. 2). For example, variations in root diameter, root length density, N concentration, root hair density, and mycorrhizal colonization all have links to total plant uptake capacity and represent tradeoffs among different acquisition strategies. Variation in basic root traits may also provide information on how plastic species of plants may be in response to changing environments. At the meeting, David Eissenstat (Pennsylvania State University, USA) discussed recent work in a common garden where fertilizer application in localized patches increased root survivorship in species with smaller root diameters (more plastic response) but not in those with larger root diameters (less plastic response) (Adams et al., 2013). Extending beyond roots and further exploring the soil, mycorrhizal fungi form an intimate symbiosis with many plant species and represent the most distal portion of the root–fungal resource acquisition system. Here again, systematic differences in mycorrhizal traits can provide useful clues regarding their activity and persistence in soils (Fig. 2). Recent reviews have highlighted the potential for categorizing mycorrhizal fungi based on observable/measurable traits that then relate to their function and broader ecosystem impacts (Van Der Heijden & Scheublin, 2007; Chagnon et al., 2013; Phillips et al., 2013; Koide et al., 2014). For example, at the meeting Erik Hobbie (University of New Hampshire, USA) presented recent work showing that C and N isotopes can be used to infer activity and exploration strategies of ectomycorrhizal fungi (Hobbie & Agerer, 2009), while others have reported that the degree of fungal tissue melanization may relate to stress tolerance and persistence (Fernandez & Koide, 2013). Indeed, the high diversity and often cryptic nature of mycorrhizal fungi may necessitate the use of functional traits to better understand mycorrhizal form, functional relationships, and ecosystem effects. Ecosystem responses to climate change, altered land use, and species invasions are often the result of complex interactions among multiple ecosystem components. As such, observing below- and aboveground processes independently may result in limited and potentially erroneous conclusions. Based on a series of experiments conducted using species common in grasslands of Inner Mongolia, China, Wen-Hao Zhang (Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China) presented evidence that shifts in species abundance with N deposition, long thought to be the result of increasing light competition, may result from multiple factors including a decrease in soil pH which increases the availability of manganese (Mn), leading to Mn toxicity in forbs (W-H. Zhang, unpublished). As a result of fundamental differences between dicots and monocots in their biochemical pathways for uptake of Mn and iron, grasses were favored over forbs and overall ecosystem diversity declined. Interestingly, similar declines in sugar maple (Acer saccharum) have been observed with chronic N deposition in parts of the northeast USA. Here again, declines resulted from altered plant nutrition that first began with an increased availability of Mn in acidified soils and reduced availability of primary nutrients (St Clair & Lynch, 2005). In both ecosystems, only by observing aboveground portions of ecosystems in the context of belowground processes could changes in ecosystem function be understood. Species invasions offer some of the most compelling examples demonstrating the need to integrate belowground processes into a whole-ecosystem perspective. Indeed, many studies now link interactions among roots and soil biota as important factors determining the success of an invading plant species. For example, the success of the invasive garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) is attributed, at least in part, to its ability to inhibit mycorrhizal fungi, thereby reducing the ability of many competing plant species to obtain soil resources (Stinson et al., 2006). Recent work presented by Ian Dickie (Lincoln University, New Zealand) provides evidence for facilitation of invasive Pinus contorta in New Zealand by co-invasion of ectomycorrhizal symbionts which may be further mediated by invasions of nonnative mammals (Dickie et al., 2010; J. R. Wood et al., unpublished). This is a fascinating example of how multi-stage and multi-component interactions dictate the composition and function of many terrestrial ecosystems, including novel ecosystems created through concurrent invasions of multiple species from multiple continents. Currently, many ecosystem- and global-scale models express highly simplified descriptions of root processes with little to no mechanistic function tied to spatial and temporal patterns of root growth (Smithwick et al., 2014). Furthermore, few models explicitly incorporate mycorrhizal fungi requiring C and nutrient fluxes through mycorrhizal biomass to be captured indirectly if at all (but see Orwin et al., 2011; Phillips et al., 2013; Deckmyn et al., 2014). However, accurately modeling ecosystem processes along environmental gradients or responses to global change factors requires greater empirical understanding of root and mycorrhizal processes in conjunction with their impacts on ecosystem functioning (Ostonen et al., 2011; Iversen et al., 2012). To that end, some of the most important discussions in Beijing were centered on the development of a functional database of root traits and a network linking rhizosphere–ecosystem research across the globe. Development of an improved, publicly available database coupled with an organized network of sites investigating links between above- and belowground ecology could provide an efficient way to gain and supply data needed by modelers. Led by Colleen Iversen (Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA), efforts are underway to develop a comprehensive root trait database through expansions of the existing TRY plant trait database (www.try-db.org) and additional service through Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) data centers. Importantly, this database will (1) accommodate submission of root traits by individual root order, which enables more meaningful comparisons across species, and (2) emphasize traits and processes with specific relevance to terrestrial biosphere models. Furthermore, recent efforts in China have also seen the development of a domestic network of sites focused on linking belowground and whole-ecosystem processes, RhizoNet. Though in its infancy, this and other networks may be developed into coordinated global networks where open exchange of ideas and research methodologies will greatly improve cross-site data comparisons and enhance overall appreciation of terrestrial processes. Together, these and other efforts to identify global patterns of root and mycorrhizal traits across diverse phylogenies will pay dividends in the future as we seek to understand root and fungal responses to environmental perturbations. As consistent patterns emerge, these basic trait data can then be used to inform novel hypotheses testing the mechanisms that determine variation in rhizosphere function. Ultimately, understanding rhizosphere processes may be the key to accurately describing and anticipating global patterns of ecosystem functioning today and into the future.",W2017456328,True,0.9830551147460938
https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13200,Competition drives trait evolution and character displacement between <i>Mimulus</i> species along an environmental gradient,"Closely related species may evolve to coexist stably in sympatry through niche differentiation driven by in situ competition, a process termed character displacement. Alternatively, past evolution in allopatry may have already sufficiently reduced niche overlap to permit establishment in sympatry, a process called ecological sorting. The relative importance of each process to niche differentiation is contentious even though they are not mutually exclusive and are both mediated via multivariate trait evolution. We explore how competition has impacted niche differentiation in two monkeyflowers, Mimulus alsinoides and M. guttatus, which often co-occur. Through field observations, common gardens, and competition experiments, we demonstrate that M. alsinoides is restricted to marginal habitats in sympatry and that the impacts of character displacement on niche differentiation are complex. Competition with M. guttatus alters selection gradients and has favored taller M. alsinoides with earlier seasonal flowering at low elevation and floral shape divergence at high elevation. However, no trait exhibits the pattern typically associated with character displacement, higher divergence between species in sympatry than allopatry. Thus, although character displacement was unlikely the process driving initial divergence along niche axes necessary for coexistence, we conclude that competition in sympatry has likely driven trait evolution along additional niche axes.",W2587620327,True,0.9650911092758179
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12403,The sign of cascading predator effects varies with prey traits in a detrital system,"Theory and experiments show that the nature of 'green' trophic cascades, between predators, herbivores and plants, varies with several key species traits: predator hunting mode and predator and prey habitat domains. Meanwhile, 'brown' cascades between predators, environment-modifying detritivores and plants have been largely overlooked and the roles of species traits, particularly prey traits, in determining the nature of these cascades remains unclear. We hypothesize that, in predator-detritivore-plant interaction chains, the burrowing ability of plant-facilitating detritivores determines their response to predators and thus the sign of indirect effect transmitted. In the dung-decomposer food web of an alpine meadow, we predicted that in the presence of above-ground predacious beetles: (i) non-burrowing detritivores will suffer mortality due to predation and transmit negative indirect effects to plants, whereas (ii) burrowing detritivores will escape predation by retreating deeper into the soil, transmitting positive indirect effects to plants. In support of predictions, experiments showed that a single species of predacious beetle (i) reduced the density of the non-burrowing species and indirectly reduced dung loss rate, soil nutrient concentrations and plant biomass, but (ii) drove the burrowing species deeper, indirectly improved soil conditions and increased plant biomass. These results show that the burrowing ability of a detritivore can determine whether it transmits a negative indirect effect mediated by a reduction in its density, or a positive indirect effect mediated by its behavioural response to predation risk. We call for further tests of our detritivore-trait hypothesis in different regions and ecosystems to further develop a general trait-based framework for trophic cascades in detrital food webs. We further advance the general hypothesis that the locomotion traits of prey species (e.g. burrowing/flying ability) may help explain their behavioural response to predation risk and the nature of indirect effect they transmit from predators to plants.",W1549655949,True,0.9813133478164673
https://doi.org/10.3390/d12100397,Can Functional Traits Explain Plant Coexistence? A Case Study with Tropical Lianas and Trees,"Organisms are adapted to their environment through a suite of anatomical, morphological, and physiological traits. These functional traits are commonly thought to determine an organism’s tolerance to environmental conditions. However, the differences in functional traits among co-occurring species, and whether trait differences mediate competition and coexistence is still poorly understood. Here we review studies comparing functional traits in two co-occurring tropical woody plant guilds, lianas and trees, to understand whether competing plant guilds differ in functional traits and how these differences may help to explain tropical woody plant coexistence. We examined 36 separate studies that compared a total of 140 different functional traits of co-occurring lianas and trees. We conducted a meta-analysis for ten of these functional traits, those that were present in at least five studies. We found that the mean trait value between lianas and trees differed significantly in four of the ten functional traits. Lianas differed from trees mainly in functional traits related to a faster resource acquisition life history strategy. However, the lack of difference in the remaining six functional traits indicates that lianas are not restricted to the fast end of the plant life–history continuum. Differences in functional traits between lianas and trees suggest these plant guilds may coexist in tropical forests by specializing in different life–history strategies, but there is still a significant overlap in the life–history strategies between these two competing guilds.",W3092745668,True,0.9128941297531128
https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2013.0879,Parasites that change predator or prey behaviour can have keystone effects on community composition,"Parasites play pivotal roles in structuring communities, often via indirect interactions with non-host species. These effects can be density-mediated (through mortality) or trait-mediated (behavioural, physiological and developmental), and may be crucial to population interactions, including biological invasions. For instance, parasitism can alter intraguild predation (IGP) between native and invasive crustaceans, reversing invasion outcomes. Here, we use mathematical models to examine how parasite-induced trait changes influence the population dynamics of hosts that interact via IGP. We show that trait-mediated indirect interactions impart keystone effects, promoting or inhibiting host coexistence. Parasites can thus have strong ecological impacts, even if they have negligible virulence, underscoring the need to consider trait-mediated effects when predicting effects of parasites on community structure in general and biological invasions in particular.",W2164023607,True,0.9705756902694702
https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.03800,Direct litter interference and indirect soil competitive effects of two contrasting phenotypes of a spiny legume shrub drive the forb composition of an oromediterranean community,"Contrasting phenotypes of foundation species are known to differentially affect understorey plants. However, there is little knowledge on both the mechanisms of competition (resource competition versus interference) of stress‐tolerant phenotypes and the importance of indirect interactions. In an oromediterranean community from Mount Lebanon we assessed the effects on understorey forbs of two contrasting phenotypes, a tight competitive from stressful habitat and a loose facilitative from more benign habitat. In a dry south and a wet north exposure we assessed short‐term resource effects removing shrub canopy and long‐term soil effects (including litter interference) with the comparison of forb performances in adjacent naturally open areas vs no shrub. Indirect effects were quantified through the removal of grasses. Abundance, richness and biomass of forbs were measured in all treatments after one year of experiment, together with litter depth and soil moisture. We found strong direct negative soil effects of the tight phenotype on all forb performances and in particular in south exposure. These effects were due to litter interference on water availability, but not to resource competition. They were likely explained by the high hydrophobicity of organic matter accumulating in the stressful habitat of the tight phenotype. We also found an indirect competition of the loose phenotype for forb richness, due to its direct positive soil effect on competitive grasses, and in particular in south exposure. Our results improve our knowledge on the importance of litter interference in dry nutrient‐poor habitats and the role of indirect interactions in phenotypic effects on understorey species.",W2564056314,True,0.9707966446876526

Asynarchus larvae predominate in temporary wetlands and are aggressive intraguild predators on Limnephilus larvae, which only predominate in permanent basins with salamanders. We first conducted a field experiment in mesocosms (cattle tanks) to quantify the predatory effects of different life stages of salamanders on the two caddisfly species. Two life stages of the salamanders (larvae and paedomorphs) preferentially preyed on Asynarchus relative to Limnephilus. Subsequent laboratory experiments revealed that high Asynarchus activity rates and relatively ineffective antipredatory behaviors led to higher salamander detection and attack rates compared to Limnephilus. In a second field experiment (full factorial for presence and absence of each of the three species), we found that salamander predation on Asynarchus had an indirect positive effect on Limnephilus: survival was higher in the presence of salamanders + Asynarchus than with just Asynarchus. In the laboratory we compared the predatory effects of salamanders with and without their mouths sewn shut and found the observed indirect positive effect on Limnephilus survival to be mainly the result of reduced numbers of Asynarchus rather than salamander-induced changes in Asynarchus behavior. We argue that indirect effects of predator–predator interactions on shared prey will be mainly density-mediated and not trait-mediated when one of the predators (in this case, Asynarchus) is under strong selection for rapid growth and therefore does not modify foraging behaviors in response to the other predator. The reciprocal dominance of Limnephilus and Asynarchus in habitats with and without salamanders probably reflects a trade-off between competitive superiority and vulnerability to predation. The high activity levels and aggressiveness that enable Asynarchus to complete development in temporary habitats result in strong asymmetric competition (via intraguild predation) with Limnephilus. In permanent habitats these same behaviors increase Asynarchus vulnerability to salamander predation, which indirectly benefits Limnephilus. This and previous work implicate salamanders as keystone predators that exert a major influence on the composition of benthic and planktonic assemblages in subalpine wetlands.",W2008976596,True,0.9458919763565063
https://doi.org/10.5194/bgd-11-13157-2014,Testing functional trait-based mechanisms underpinning plant responses to grazing and linkages to ecosystem functioning in grasslands,"Abstract. Abundant evidence has shown that grazing alters plant functional traits, ecological strategies, community structure, and ecosystem functioning of grasslands. Few studies, however, have examined how plant responses to grazing are mediated by resource availability and functional group identity. We test functional trait-based mechanisms underlying the responses of different life forms to grazing and linkages to ecosystem functioning along a soil moisture gradient in the Inner Mongolia grassland. A principal component analysis (PCA) based on 9 traits × 276 species matrix showed that the plant size spectrum (i.e., individual biomass), leaf economics spectrum (leaf N content and leaf density), and light competition spectrum (height and stem-leaf biomass ratio) distinguished plant species responses to grazing. The three life forms exhibited differential strategies as indicated by trait responses to grazing. The annuals and biennials adopted grazing-tolerant strategies associated with high growth rate, reflected by high leaf N content and specific leaf area. The perennial grasses exhibited grazing-tolerant strategies associated with great regrowth capacity and high palatability scores, whereas perennial forbs showed grazing-avoidant strategies with short stature and low palatability scores. In addition, the dominant perennial bunchgrasses exhibited mixed tolerance–resistance strategies to grazing and mixed acquisitive–conservative strategies in resource utilization. Grazing increased the relative abundance of perennial forbs with low palatability in the wet and fertile meadow, but it promoted perennial grasses with high palatability in the dry and infertile typical steppe. Our findings suggest that the effects of grazing on plant functional traits are dependent on both the abiotic (e.g., soil moisture) and biotic (e.g., plant functional group identity and composition) factors. Grazing-induced shifts in functional group composition are largely dependent on resource availability, particularly water availability.",W2164373077,True,0.9540144205093384
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.14042,Diet quality and conspecific larval density predict functional trait variation and performance in a polyphagous frugivorous fly,"Abstract Diet quality and the presence and abundance of conspecifics feeding on the same food resource are critical factors that affect functional traits of many animal species and influence ecological processes. We hypothesized that in insects whose larvae live in groups of varying sizes in ephemeral and nutritionally variable environments, extreme macronutrient content in the feeding substrate is a barrier for optimal performance that can be overcome by the collective feeding behaviour of large numbers of larvae. We experimentally examined how multiple immature and adult traits of the polyphagous tephritid fruit fly, Anastrepha ludens, vary as a function of the quality of its larval diet (protein + carbohydrate [P + C] content of 8.0%–12.6% w/w, and protein‐to‐carbohydrate [P/C] ratio of 1.8–0.11) across extreme levels of conspecific larval densities (60–600 larvae/60 g of diet). Overall, we found positive effects on survival of immature and adult stages, the duration of the larval stage, pupal weight and adult emergence of flies, as dietary P + C content increased, followed by negative effects when the diet had extremely high carbohydrate‐biased macronutrient content. Larval density had positive, negative and curvilinear effects depending on the macronutrient composition of the food, resulting in a range of fly responses through a continuous scale of macronutrient content and larval density combinations. Optimal performance of A. ludens, in terms of larval development time, body weight and survival to adulthood, was found when the diet consisted of low P + C content and high P/C ratios, and low larval densities. Our findings point to a diet‐mediated relationship between density and survival to the adult stage, suggesting that large numbers (up to a point) of larvae can balance negative effects of conspecific competition when food is characterised by high macronutrient content and low P/C ratios. We conclude that diet quality and conspecific density interact in complex ways to shape trait expression and performance in a frugivorous fly. Addressing this interaction is key to advance the understanding of the mechanisms behind changes in population dynamics in insect species living in groups confined in isolated and ephemeral resources.

However, the extent to which functional traits reflect floristic turnover in response to interactions between climate and landscape gradients is rarely assessed. We tested whether floristic variation among sites within a bioregion was more strongly correlated with soil fertility or climate. We then examined the relationship between floristic composition, environment and the co-variation of selected vegetative and regenerative functional traits. This allowed us to assess the ecological sorting of species along soil fertility and rainfall gradients and to detect any resource compensation effects via interactions between these factors. Floristic differences were equally associated with soil fertility and climate contrasts but species’ trait patterns were more strongly associated with soil fertility than rainfall. No interactive effects, which would suggest resource compensation, were detected. Instead, more fertile sites consistently had more forbs, annuals and grasses in comparison with less fertile sites which were dominated by woody species and had a higher abundance of graminoids. Three broad mechanisms for sorting of species based on trait patterns are proposed (1) differences in the fundamental regenerative and growth niche, (2) resource competition during establishment and (3) disturbance-mediated sorting.",W2161049907,True,0.9896279573440552

As a consequence, it is likely that the outcome of competitive interactions between native and invasive plants may be mediated by soil nutrient availability. We independently investigated competitive effect and response as well as the occurrence of asymmetric competition among native and invasive plants on soils of varying nutrient availability, using a glasshouse experiment. Seedlings of eight co‐occurring pairs of invasive and native species from low fertility Hawkesbury Sandstone‐derived soil were grown under low and high nutrient availability. We tested the hypotheses that native species would be competitively superior at low nutrient availability and have trait values associated with a resource conservation strategy while invasive species would be competitively superior at high nutrient availability and have trait values associated with a resource acquisition strategy. We found that nutrient availability did not mediate competitive interactions between invasive and native species. Instead, two invasive and one native species were always competitively superior irrespective of nutrient availability. Competitively superior species displayed a mixture of both resource conservation and acquisition strategies at low and high nutrient availability. In support of previous studies, we found that the a priori classification of invasive and native species does not predict competitive superiority at varying nutrient levels. Rather, species specific differences in trait values provide a competitive advantage in response to nutrient availability.",W2492673808,True,0.9514773488044739

Despite the ubiquity of phenotypic variation within natural populations, its effects on the dynamics of ecological communities are not well understood. Here, we use a quantitative genetics framework to examine how phenotypic variation in a predator affects the outcome of apparent competition between its two prey species. Classical apparent competition theory predicts that prey have reciprocally negative effects on each other. The addition of phenotypic trait variation in predation can marginalize these negative effects, mediate coexistence, or generate positive indirect effects between the prey species. Long-term coexistence or facilitation, however, can be preceded by long transients of extinction risk whenever the heritability of phenotypic variation is low. Greater heritability can circumvent these ecological transients but also can generate oscillatory and chaotic dynamics. These dramatic changes in ecological outcomes, in the sign of indirect effects, and in stability suggest that studies which ignore intraspecific trait variation may reach fundamentally incorrect conclusions regarding ecological dynamics.",W2107810237,True,0.9612467885017395

Understanding the environmental context and species traits that give rise to these divergent outcomes is a major challenge to the generality of both theoretical and applied ecology. In aquatic systems, nutrient-mediated eutrophication has led to major declines in species diversity, motivating us to seek terrestrial analogues using a large-mammal system across 598 000 km 2 of the Canadian boreal forest. These forests are undergoing some of the most rapid rates of land-use change on Earth and are home to declining caribou ( Rangifer tarandus caribou ) populations. Using satellite-derived estimates of primary productivity, coupled with estimates of moose ( Alces alces ) and wolf ( Canis lupus ) abundance, we used path analyses to discriminate among hypotheses explaining how habitat alteration can affect caribou population growth. Hypotheses included food limitation, resource dominance by moose over caribou, and apparent competition with predators shared between moose and caribou. Results support apparent competition and yield estimates of wolf densities (1.8 individuals 1000 km −2 ) above which caribou populations decline. Our multi-trophic analysis provides insight into the cascading effects of habitat alteration from forest cutting that destabilize terrestrial predator–prey dynamics. Finally, the path analysis highlights why conservation actions directed at the proximate cause of caribou decline have been more successful in the near term than those directed further along the trophic chain.",W3122952408,True,0.9897767901420593

Predation, for example, can be stronger at lower latitudes, while competition can intensify at later stages of assembly due to resource limitation. Since biotic filters act upon functional traits of organisms, we explored trait-mediated community assembly in diverse marine assemblages from four regions along the Pacific coast of North and Central America. Using predator exclusion experiments and two assembly stages, we tested the hypotheses that non-random trait patterns would emerge during late assembly at all regions due to competition and at lower latitude regions regardless of assembly stage due to predation. As expected, trait divergence occurred in late assembly but only at higher latitude regions, while in tropical Panama, relaxed predation caused trait divergence during late assembly. Moreover, colonizing trait strategies were common during early assembly while competitive strategies were favoured during late assembly at higher latitude regions. Predation-resistant traits were only favoured in Panama during both assembly stages. Our large-scale manipulative study demonstrates that different biotic interactions across time and latitude can have important consequences for trait assembly.",W4313279032,True,0.9765257835388184
https://doi.org/10.1890/07-1131.1,REVISITING THE CLASSICS: CONSIDERING NONCONSUMPTIVE EFFECTS IN TEXTBOOK EXAMPLES OF PREDATOR–PREY INTERACTIONS,"Predator effects on prey dynamics are conventionally studied by measuring changes in prey abundance attributed to consumption by predators. We revisit four classic examples of predator-prey systems often cited in textbooks and incorporate subsequent studies of nonconsumptive effects of predators (NCE), defined as changes in prey traits (e.g., behavior, growth, development) measured on an ecological time scale. Our review revealed that NCE were integral to explaining lynx-hare population dynamics in boreal forests, cascading effects of top predators in Wisconsin lakes, and cascading effects of killer whales and sea otters on kelp forests in nearshore marine habitats. The relative roles of consumption and NCE of wolves on moose and consequent indirect effects on plant communities of Isle Royale depended on climate oscillations. Nonconsumptive effects have not been explicitly tested to explain the link between planktonic alewives and the size structure of the zooplankton, nor have they been invoked to attribute keystone predator status in intertidal communities or elsewhere. We argue that both consumption and intimidation contribute to the total effects of keystone predators, and that characteristics of keystone consumers may differ from those of predators having predominantly NCE. Nonconsumptive effects are often considered as an afterthought to explain observations inconsistent with consumption-based theory. Consequently, NCE with the same sign as consumptive effects may be overlooked, even though they can affect the magnitude, rate, or scale of a prey response to predation and can have important management or conservation implications. Nonconsumptive effects may underlie other classic paradigms in ecology, such as delayed density dependence and predator-mediated prey coexistence. Revisiting classic studies enriches our understanding of predator-prey dynamics and provides compelling rationale for ramping up efforts to consider how NCE affect traditional predator-prey models based on consumption, and to compare the relative magnitude of consumptive and NCE of predators.",W2166153649,True,0.9053308367729187

Freshwater lakes in high‐altitude areas represent a natural system for understanding resource polymorphism in fishes benefiting from diverse lacustrine environments and species‐poor fish assemblages. We report resource polymorphism in a cyprinid fish, Schizopygopsis thermalis, in Lake Amdo Tsonak Co, a headwater lake in the upper Salween River system. Two discrete intraspecific morphs, planktivorous and benthivorous, were identified according to geometric morphometrics and traditional univariate linear measures. The planktivorous morph exhibits a longer head, longer upper and lower jaw, larger asymptotic standard length ( L ∞ ), lower growth rate ( k ), and higher growth performance index ( φ ) than the benthivorous morph. With respect to descriptive traits, the planktivorous morph possesses a large, terminal mouth and obvious mucus pores on the cheek and chin, while the benthivorous morph is characterized by a more inferior mouth with a sharpen horny edge on the lower jaw and unconspicuous mucus pores. The discrete pelagic–benthic resources and low interspecific competition in the lake system might drive the initial differentiation of the two morphs, and partial spatial reproductive isolation in breeding further maintains and reinforces the differences between them.",W3041321597,True,0.9612445831298828
https://doi.org/10.1086/303415,Character Shifts of Prey Species That Share Predators,"This article uses several models to explore the potential indirect evolutionary interaction between two prey species that share one or more predator species. It asks how the antipredator adaptations of a focal prey species are likely to evolve following the introduction of a second prey species that shares one or more of the same predator species. The interactions are represented by differential equation models of homogeneous populations, and evolutionary change occurs in a single quantitative trait within each prey species. Models differ in assumptions about the number of predator types, the costs of antipredator traits, and in how predator and prey traits combine to determine a per capita capture rate. Parallel change in the antipredator characteristics of two species usually occurs when the general risk of predation is changed by the introduction of the second prey. This may be a parallel increase or decrease, depending on whether the ecological interaction is apparent competition or apparent mutualism. Divergence in trait values is most often associated with the presence of two or more distinct types of predators with some form of trade‐off in the prey's ability to avoid different predators. Divergence may also occur with a single predator type, when two or more strategies exist for reducing predation risk. Convergence is a possible outcome when there are two or more predator types. Coevolution may also produce trait and population cycles in models, and the nature of character displacement is often changed markedly by such instability. The limited evidence for evolutionary indirect effects mediated by shared predation is reviewed. Possible reasons for the disparity between theory and observation are discussed.",W1993271185,True,0.9762399196624756

Where it has been examined, the effects of overfishing have cascaded down the food chain. In an intensively fished area on the western Scotian Shelf, Northwest Atlantic, the biomass of prey species increased exponentially (doubling time of 11 years) even though the aggregate biomass of their predators remained stable over 38 years. Concomitant reductions in herbivorous zooplankton and increases in phytoplankton were also evident. This anomalous trophic pattern led us to examine how declines in predator body size (approx. 60% in body mass since the early 1970s) and climatic regime influenced lower trophic levels. The increase in prey biomass was associated primarily with declines in predator body size and secondarily to an increase in stratification. Sea surface temperature and predator biomass had no influence. A regression model explained 65 per cent of prey biomass variability. Trait-mediated effects, namely a reduction in predator size, resulted in a weakening of top predation pressure. Increased stratification may have enhanced growing conditions for prey fish. Size-selective harvesting under changing climatic conditions initiated a trophic restructuring of the food chain, the effects of which may have influenced three trophic levels.",W2133966170,True,0.9926695227622986

In this study, we coupled field observations with experiments to ask if the degree of character displacement reflects the intensity of competition between two closely related spadefoot toads (Spea bombifrons and S. multiplicata). Tadpoles of both species develop into either a small-headed omnivorous morph, which feeds mostly on detritus, or a large-headed carnivorous morph, which specializes on and whose phenotype is induced by fairy shrimp. Previously, we found that S. multiplicata are inferior competitors for fairy shrimp and are less likely to develop into carnivores in sympatry with S. bombifrons. We compared four key trophic characters in S. multiplicata across natural ponds where the frequency of S. bombifrons varied. We found that S. multiplicata became increasingly more omnivore-like as the relative abundance of S. bombifrons increased. Moreover, in controlled laboratory populations, S. multiplicata became increasingly more omnivore-like and S. bombifrons became increasingly more carnivore-like as we increased the relative abundance of the other species. Phenotypic plasticity helped mediate this divergence: S. multiplicata became increasingly less likely to eat shrimp and develop into carnivores in the presence of S. bombifrons, a superior predator on shrimp. However, divergence also reflected differences in canalized traits: When reared under common conditions, S. multiplicata tadpoles became increasingly less likely to produce carnivores as their natal pond decreased in elevation. Presumably, this pattern reflected selection against carnivores in lower-elevation ponds, because S. bombifrons became increasingly more common with decreasing elevation. Local genetic adaptation to the presence of S. bombifrons was remarkably fine grained, with differences in carnivore production detected between populations a few kilometers apart. Our results suggest that the degree of character displacement potentially reflects the intensity of competition between interacting species and that both phenotypic plasticity and fine-scale genetic differentiation can mediate this response. Moreover, these results provide causal evidence linking resource competition to species divergence.",W2173311449,True,0.9873825311660767
https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.19453,Functional traits shape plant–plant interactions and recruitment in a hotspot of woody plant diversity,"Understanding and predicting recruitment in species-rich plant communities requires identifying functional determinants of both density-independent performance and interactions. In a common-garden field experiment with 25 species of the woody plant genus Protea, we varied the initial spatial and taxonomic arrangement of seedlings and followed their survival and growth during recruitment. Neighbourhood models quantified how six key functional traits affect density-independent performance, interaction effects and responses. Trait-based neighbourhood models accurately predicted individual survival and growth from the initial spatial and functional composition of species-rich experimental communities. Functional variation among species caused substantial variation in density-independent survival and growth that was not correlated with interaction effects and responses. Interactions were spatially restricted but had important, predominantly competitive, effects on recruitment. Traits increasing the acquisition of limiting resources (water for survival and soil P for growth) mediated trade-offs between interaction effects and responses. Moreover, resprouting species had higher survival but reduced growth, likely reinforcing the survival-growth trade-off in adult plants. Resource acquisition of juvenile plants shapes Protea community dynamics with acquisitive species with strong competitive effects suffering more from competition. Together with functional determinants of density-independent performance, this makes recruitment remarkably predictable, which is critical for efficient restoration and near-term ecological forecasts of species-rich communities.",W4389608684,True,0.959064245223999
https://doi.org/10.1890/08-0250.1,RESOURCE IDENTITY MODIFIES THE INFLUENCE OF PREDATION RISK ON ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION,"It is well established that predators can scare as well as consume their prey. In many systems, the fear of being eaten causes trait-mediated cascades whose strength can rival or exceed that of more widely recognized density-mediated cascades transmitted by predators that consume their prey. Despite this progress it is only beginning to be understood how the influence of predation risk is shaped by environmental context and whether it can exert an important influence on ecosystem-level processes. This study used a factorial mesocosm experiment that manipulated basal-resource identity (either barnacles, Semibalanus balanoides, or mussels, Mytilus edulis) to determine how resources modify the influence of predation risk, cascade strength, and the efficiency of energy transfer in two, tritrophic, rocky-shore food chains containing the predatory green crab (Carcinus maenas) and an intermediate consumer (the snail, Nucella lapillus). The effect of predation risk and the strength of trait-mediated cascades (both in absolute and relative terms) were much stronger in the barnacle than in the mussel food chain. Moreover, predation risk strongly diminished the efficiency of energy transfer in the barnacle food chain but had no significant effect in the mussel food chain. The influence of resource identity on indirect-effect strength and energy transfer was likely caused by differences in how each resource shapes the degree of risk perceived by prey. We suggest that our understanding of the connection between trophic dynamics and ecosystem functioning will improve considerably once the effects of predation risk on individual behavior and physiology are considered.",W1974807310,True,0.9327995777130127

Thus, bird nestlings are highly dependent on antibodies received from their mother (in the eggs) during their rapid early growth period. The relationship between maternal immunity and the development of neonates’ own immunity has been poorly studied. It has been suggested that immune function plays an important part in mediating resource competition between different life‐history traits, e.g. growth and reproduction. Maternal investment of antibodies has potentially permanent effects on offspring phenotype. Thus, the trade‐offs between the immune function and other important life‐history traits in the offspring will also affect the fitness of the mother. Our supplemental feeding experiment in the magpie Pica pica indicates that the immunoglobulin levels of offspring at hatching are dependent on a mother's nutritional condition. In addition, the amount of maternal immunoglobulins transferred to offspring increases along the laying order within a nest. We also found that at the age of 8–10 days the immunoglobulin production of the offspring has already begun. Furthermore, the maternal immunoglobulin levels of the offspring at hatching were positively related to their immunoglobulin levels on day 10. Maternal immunoglobulins did not significantly affect offspring growth, but there was a negative relationship between self‐produced immunoglobulins and growth over the first 10 days, indicating a trade‐off between these traits. Nestlings’ weight, however, had a positive relationship with immunoglobulin production suggesting that the observed trade‐off between growth and immunoglobulin production is due to catch‐up growth of nestlings with a low hatching weight. We found that within nests nestlings with higher maternal antibody levels had higher survival rate until day 20, but between nests there was an opposite relationship. Evidently, there is a trade‐off, in magpies, between maternal resources, immune function and growth, shaping the evolution of maternal investment in offspring immunity.",W1747288921,True,0.9650278687477112

Such fitness costs impact in the ecology and evolutionary trajectory of resistant populations. 2 Neighbourhood experiments were performed to quantify competitive effects and responses between herbicide-susceptible (S) and resistant (R) Lolium rigidum individuals in which resistance is due to enhanced herbicide metabolism mediated by cytochrome P450. 3 In two-way competitive interactions between the S and R phenotypes, individuals of the S phenotype were the stronger effect competitors on both a per capita and per unit-size basis. The S phenotype also exhibited a stronger competitive response to wheat plants than did the R phenotype, displaying significantly greater (30%) above-ground biomass at the vegetative stage. When subjected to competition from wheat, R individuals produced significantly fewer reproductive tillers and allocated fewer resources to reproductive traits than individuals of the S phenotype. 4 The role of potential mechanisms underlying this resistance cost driven by traits such as plant size and tolerance to low resource availability, as well as the evolutionary implications of the results are discussed. 5 Synthesis. Evolved herbicide resistance due to enhanced-herbicide metabolism mediated by cytochrome-P450 in L. rigidum has been shown to be accompanied with an impaired ability to compete for resources.

Here we tested the effects of biotic and abiotic factors, on the morphology of two contrasting Muridae species (Chinese white-bellied rats Niviventer confucianus [n = 565; 57.1 g] and Edwards's long-tailed giant rats Leopoldamys edwardsi [n = 45; 459.5 g]) in relation to Bergmann's, Allen's, Hesse's and Geist's eco-geographical rules along a 2900-m elevational gradient. Specifically, we tested the ""body size threshold"" theory, which posits that animals heavier than 0.16 kg are more likely to follow Bergmann's rule. We measured body length and mass, appendage lengths and heart mass for 610 adult specimens from 115 localities, and used principal components analysis to quantify food resource availability. Linear mixed models were employed to test these eco-geographical rules, along with the effects of associated biotic and abiotic factors. We found that for N. confucianus (< 0.16 kg), colder temperatures were associated with smaller body-size, contrary to Bergmann's rule, and with greater interspecific competition and food abundance (supporting Geist's rule). There was no support for Allen's rule, except for a contrary effect on snout length among females; however, greater intraspecific competition and lesser food abundance were associated with shorter snout length, supporting Geist's rule. Heart size increased with colder temperatures, but only among females, partly supporting Hesse's rule, and decreased with greater intraspecific competition for both sexes. L. edwardsi (> 0.16 kg) did not conform with any eco-geographic rules, and so we found no support for the ""body size threshold"" theory. Our study proposes that food resource abundance and inter- and intraspecific competition mediated variations in morphological traits in these rodent species to a greater extent than any reduction in temperature alone, giving little support for ecogeographical rule effects. We interpret that where food supply can meet energetic demands, even under colder conditions, then any selective pressure for thermal/energy efficiency through larger body size and shorter appendages will be alleviated. Considering the full range of inter-related factors that are affected by temperature, rather than just the bio-physics of heat loss, is important to better predict future climate change responses.",W4309769680,True,0.970604419708252

We performed a whole-lake experiment by stocking a non-native top predator (pikeperch (Sander lucioperca)) to two residential piscivores (Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) and northern pike (Esox lucius)). By analyzing spatial distribution, diet composition, growth, and consumption rates of the piscivores before and after pikeperch introduction, we tested how both density-dependent and trait-mediated responses affected interactions between the three predators. Total piscivore biomass increased 1.5 times and annual consumption by the piscivores increased 1.7 times after stocking, attributable to the stocked pikeperch and increased northern pike abundances. Abundance, distribution, and consumption data indicated that northern pike was hardly affected by pikeperch stocking and even increased its biomass, whereas piscivorous perch shifted its habitat use towards the littoral lake areas in response to competition with pikeperch. Furthermore, all piscivores increasingly fed on small perch. The forced habitat shift of piscivorous perch in combination with increased predation on small perch led to a decreased abundance of large perch, attributable to the compensatory effects of intraguild predation and cannibalism.",W2104930916,True,0.9945521354675293
https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2014.1952,Prey state shapes the effects of temporal variation in predation risk,"The ecological impacts of predation risk are influenced by how prey allocate foraging effort across periods of safety and danger. Foraging decisions depend on current danger, but also on the larger temporal, spatial or energetic context in which prey manage their risks of predation and starvation. Using a rocky intertidal food chain, we examined the responses of starved and fed prey (Nucella lapillus dogwhelks) to different temporal patterns of risk from predatory crabs (Carcinus maenas). Prey foraging activity declined during periods of danger, but as dangerous periods became longer, prey state altered the magnitude of risk effects on prey foraging and growth, with likely consequences for community structure (trait-mediated indirect effects on basal resources, Mytilus edulis mussels), prey fitness and trophic energy transfer. Because risk is inherently variable over time and space, our results suggest that non-consumptive predator effects may be most pronounced in productive systems where prey can build energy reserves during periods of safety and then burn these reserves as 'trophic heat' during extended periods of danger. Understanding the interaction between behavioural (energy gain) and physiological (energy use) responses to risk may illuminate the context dependency of trait-mediated trophic cascades and help explain variation in food chain length.",W2032709850,True,0.990456223487854
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0269-8463.2005.00965.x,Neutral theory in community ecology and the hypothesis of functional equivalence,"Probably no ecologist in the world with even a modicum of field experience would seriously question the existence of niche differences among competing species on the same trophic level. The real question, however, is how did these niche differences evolve, how are they maintained ecologically, and what niche differences, if any, matter to the assembly of ecological communities? By ecological community I refer to co-occurring assemblages of trophically similar species. By assembly I mean which species, having which niche traits, and how many species, co-occur in a given community. In my judgement, despite a long and rich tradition of research on these questions in community ecology (Chase & Leibold 2003), we are still far from having definitive answers. Several years ago, in an attempt to provide a fresh approach for tackling these questions, I introduced a formal neutral theory for ecology (Hubbell 1997, 2001). The traditional strategy has been to assume that ecological communities are inherently high-dimensional sensuHutchinson's (1957) niche hypervolume for each species, and then to build rather complex models from the outset, incorporating as many of the details of the growth and interactions of each and every species and with their physical environment as possible. Neutral theory, however, adopts a fundamentally different strategy, taking virtually the opposite tack. It begins with the simplest possible hypothesis one can think of – for example, the functional equivalence of species – and then adds complexity back into the theory only as absolutely required to obtain satisfactory agreement with the data. In this approach, one does not assume from the start that ecological communities are high-dimensional. Indeed, the fundamental question now becomes: What is the minimum necessary dimensionality of the theory required to characterize a given ecological community to a desired level of realism and precision? The hypothesis of functional equivalence is the cornerstone of neutral theory. It states that trophically similar species are, at least to a first approximation, demographically identical on a per capita basis in terms of their vital rates, of birth, death, dispersal – and even speciation. Elsewhere I have also used the term symmetry to describe such species (Hubbell 2005). Under the hypothesis of functional equivalence, species can still differ in a great many ways – including characters that enable taxonomists to recognize them as good species – so long as species do not differ in their per capita vital rates. All species in all trophically defined communities violate this assumption to some degree, but the question is, how good an approximation is it? In ecology, there are often multiple, sufficient explanations for the same phenomenon (Chave, Muller-Landau & Levin 2002; Purves & Pacala 2005), and this is especially true of approximate explanations. The strategy of neutral theory relies heavily on Occam's Razor; but whether the assembly rules of ecological communities in nature obey this maxim – to always choose the most parsimonious explanation – is not yet clear. However, as Harte (2003) pointed out, one doesn't necessarily discard theories just because they are just approximations. Physicists still use Boyle's Law, PV = nRT (pressure P times volume V is a linear function of absolute temperature T), even though there are no perfect gases that follow this relationship exactly. Similarly, we continue to teach the Lotka–Volterra equations in ecology, even though no ecologist today would defend them as precise or mechanistic descriptions of nature. Much has been written about the unified neutral theory (UNT) since my book appeared (Hubbell 2001), some of it critical, and there have been several major technical and conceptual advances in the theory since then (e.g. Volkov et al. 2003; Vallade & Houchmandzadeh 2003; Houchmandzadeh & Vallade 2003; McKane, Alonso & Sole 2004; Etienne & Olff 2004). However, my main focus for this forum on neutral theory will not be on the new developments in the theory or on the criticisms. Rather, I wish to highlight the empirical observations that led me to question my own long-held beliefs about the assembly rules for ecological communities in the first place, particularly in plant communities. Before discussing these observations, however, I should sketch out a few of the major milestones in the intellectual history of the classical paradigm of competitive niche assembly theory. Since Grinnell (1917), and more formally since Hutchinson (1957, 1959), ecologists have sought a theoretical framework for the ecological niche concept that would be both necessary and sufficient to explain the coexistence of species having particular suites of traits in ecological communities. Early on, Gause (1934) put forth the central tenet of niche theory in his competitive exclusion principle, which states, paraphrased, that no two species with identical niches can coexist indefinitely. Gause tested this idea by fitting the celebrated Lotka–Volterra equations of two-species competition to the dynamics of competitive exclusion in laboratory populations of Paramecium. From Gause's day onward, the discussion of coexistence and community assembly rules has been framed almost exclusively in terms of competition, despite numerous but largely unsuccessful attempts to broaden the discussion to include additional mechanisms. Gause's principle implied that there must be a maximum tolerable overlap in the use of shared resources for two species to coexist or, in other words, there should be some limiting similarity between the niches of coexisting species (Hutchinson 1959; MacArthur & Levins 1967; MacArthur 1970). The principle also implied that competitive exclusion should be a commonplace observation in nature, or at the very least, that there should be widespread evidence of character displacement in resource use when very similar species co-occur. The empirical evidence, in general, has not borne out these predictions (Grant 1972, 1975), particularly in plant communities. There are only a few well documented examples of character displacement, all of which are in animals; for example, the evolution of beak size in competing Darwin's finches (Grant 1986), similar niche separation in seed-eating sparrows (Pulliam 1975) or in body size in desert rodents (Brown 1975). Most of these cases involve low-dimensional resource competition. However, I know of few examples of proven character displacement in plants, and the list of species whose actual disappearance from a community can be attributed to competitive exclusion is vanishingly short. Hutchinson's (1957) niche hypervolume was a more general concept of niche than one defined solely by limiting resources, and included, for example, the tolerance ranges for physical variables of the environment. His ideas about the fundamental and realized niches invoked competition to explain why species only occupy a subset of the niche space that would be suitable for them in the absence of competitors. However, if niches evolve, and if species are always restricted to smaller, realized niches in equilibrium communities, then how do we explain the persistence of adaptations for parts of fundamental niche space that are never occupied? I will return to this question shortly. The theory for community assembly based on the competitive niche paradigm became highly developed, first with multispecies community matrix theory (Levins 1968), which was developed on the foundation of the Lotka–Volterra equations, and then with more mechanistic theory, which explicitly incorporated the dynamics of resource supply and consumption along with the dynamics of the resource-dependent consumer species (Tilman 1982, 1987). This resource-based theory gave new impetus to testing community assembly rules through direct experimental manipulations of resource availability, most notably in plant community ecology. Perhaps the most significant conceptual spin-off of resource-based theory, however, was broader recognition of the fundamental importance of physiological and life history trade-offs (e.g. Tilman 1982, 1988; Kneitel & Chase 2004). In resource-based, or so-called R* theory, trade-offs occur everywhere because they are essential for coexistence. For example, in two-species competition for two limiting resources, stable coexistence happens only when each species has a higher break-even (R*) requirement for that resource which most limits its own growth, which represents a trade-off in the ability to exploit the two resources. The importance of trade-offs in resource use led Tilman (1994) to consider trade-offs in other life-history characteristics besides those involving resource exploitation, and here additional problems with the classical paradigm began to surface. In particular, Tilman revisited the old fugitive species concept of Hutchinson, and showed theoretically that if there was a strict transitive trade-off between competitive ability (site tenacity) and dispersal ability then, in principle, any arbitrary number of species could coexist. However, soon thereafter, Hurtt & Pacala (1995) showed that Tilman's trade-off assumption could be relaxed and that species of arbitrary competitive and dispersal abilities could coexist if dispersal and recruitment limitation were sufficiently strong. Hurtt and Pacala defined dispersal and recruitment limitation as the failure of species to reach and/or establish in all sites favourable for their growth and survival. When dispersal was infinite, such that all species reached all sites, then the best competitor won each site for which it was superior, the equilibrium solution expected from the classical theory. However, when dispersal and recruitment limitation were strong, many sites were won by default by competitively inferior species because the best competitor for the sites failed to reach them. Although the coexistence produced by this mechanism is non-equilibrium, Hurtt and Pacala showed that competitive exclusion could be essentially infinitely delayed. This result meant that Gause's competitive exclusion principle was not generally true in spatial ecology. The slowness to reach equilibrium also depended on species richness. The more species there were in the community, the stronger dispersal limitation became, and the slower the approach to equilibrium. The elimination of species by competitive exclusion is so slow, in fact, that all it takes to balance species loss and achieve a true long-term equilibrium in species richness and relative species abundance is to incorporate a very slow rate of introduction of new species (i.e. speciation) (Hubbell 2001). The idea of assuming functional equivalence as a theoretical point of departure in community ecology is not particularly new, particularly in plant ecology (Hubbell 1979; Goldberg & Werner 1983; Shmida & Ellner 1984). Neutral theory assumes functional equivalence at the entire community level, but this is much broader than is typically assumed by ecophysiologists and ecosystem ecologists when they aggregate similar species into functional groups (e.g. Reich, Walters & Ellsworth 1997). Recognizing functional groups implies that niche differences among these groups are believed to matter to the assembly, stability and resilience of communities to disturbance (e.g. Loreau, Naeem & Inchausti 2002), although their quantitative importance remains controversial (Hubbell 2005). However, the literature on functional groups has been remarkably silent about the assumption of species equivalence within functional groups, which flies squarely in the face of classical niche theory. Perhaps this silence is because the idea of functional groups largely emerged from the ecosystem perspective, which traditionally has not been focused on species-level questions. There has also been very little discussion about the selective regimes that would lead to the evolution of functional equivalence within functional groups (Hubbell & Foster 1986b; Hubbell 2005). As a result, there is not much development of theory in community ecology for the assembly of functional groups. Does a limiting niche similarity for species in functional groups exist? How many coexisting species can be packed into a functional group? I believe that the answer to the first question is no (at least in plants), and the answer to the second question is essentially arbitrary (again, at least in plants). Loreau (2004) has recently argued that functional equivalence does not really exist. However, in a companion paper (Hubbell 2005), I demonstrate that functional equivalence can evolve easily and often, under selective circumstances that should be commonplace in nature, especially in species-rich communities. My ideas on functional equivalence have developed slowly over the past quarter century. Since 1980 my colleagues and I have been studying the dynamics of a large (50 ha) mapped plot of old-growth tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, attempting to understand the assembly rules of the BCI tree community (Hubbell & Foster 1983). The BCI Forest Dynamics plot contains a little over 300 tree and shrub species and 230–240 thousand stems, depending on the census, with a stem diameter of at least 1 cm at breast height (d.b.h). Details of the BCI plot and the dataset are now well known, and the research design has now been replicated in a pantropical network of plots (Condit 1998). However, I will confine my discussion to the BCI findings because the BCI dataset is the oldest, having now been censused five times. The first observation about the BCI tree community is that there appears to be single dominating axis of niche differentiation, organized by variation in light and its distribution in the forest, that can be well characterized by a trade-off between survival under shade stress and maximum growth rate in full sun (Fig. 1) (Hubbell & Foster 1992). The ends of this axis, or life history manifold, are occupied on one end by species that have high survival in deep shade but low maximal growth rate in full sun, and on the other end, by species that have low survival in the shade, but have very high relative growth rates in full sun. Looking only at species at the extremes of the life history manifold, one can clearly identify different functional syndromes of traits. At some risk of caricature, one end of the manifold is the colonizer (pioneer) functional group and the other end is occupied by the competitive (stress tolerater) functional group. Species exhibiting the colonizer syndrome generally have good dispersal ability, are light-demanding and fast-growing, but also have relatively short life spans, low wood density, and low resistance to predators, herbivores, and pathogens. Species exhibiting the competitive syndrome, on the other hand, typically have variably poorer dispersal ability, and are tolerant of low light levels, but are generally slower growing in full sun, and they have longer life spans correlated with high wood density and with generally higher resistance to predators, herbivores, and pathogens. Principal axis of life history differentiation among BCI tree species is in relation to light availability. Each dot represents the mean phenotype of a single species. Species at the upper left are shade-tolerant species with high annual percentage survival in understorey shade but low annual relative growth rate in full sun, measured as a percentage of initial stem diameter. Species at the lower right are light-demanding, gap-dependent species that exhibit high mean relative growth rates in full sun, but low mean annual survival rates in understorey shade. Note the concentration of species at the shade-tolerant end of the manifold. Data such as this are usually interpreted as evidence for a trade-off between survival and growth rate. However, these mean phenotype points mask significant within-species variation in survival and growth performance (see Fig. 4). After Hubbell & Foster (1992). Having made this generalization, however, we note that the numbers of species exhibiting these syndromes are very different. There are very many more shade-tolerant species in the BCI forest than pioneer species. Note also that that there is no clear life history dichotomy separating these two syndromes into functional groups. In fact, there is a complete continuum of intermediate species between the extremes. There is also a complete continuum in the demographic characteristics of BCI tree species in terms of population sizes, skewing of stem size class distributions, and wood density (Wright et al. 2003). In general, the mean abundance of species also declines with an increase in the degree of 'gappiness'. These results might be reconciled with classic niche theory, but it is not easy to do so. First of all, in the densely populated shade-tolerant end of the life history manifold, there are many species that are virtually indistinguishable in their shade tolerance and relative growth rates. If this clustering of species at the shade end is to be explained by niche theory, then one must come up with a plausible argument for why niches are more finely partitioned under low-light conditions than under high-light conditions. If there is a limiting niche similarity in these basic functional traits, then it is not at all obvious. To my way of thinking, these data are more simply explained by an alternative hypothesis. I believe that species are selected to exhibit the syndrome of traits that adapt them for growth and survival under the commonest environmental conditions, regardless of how many other species are doing the same thing. This evolutionary process has the incidental effect of causing species to converge on similar trait syndromes, given whatever constraints are imposed by their different phylogenetic histories (Chazdon et al. 2003). Functional convergence provides one possible evolutionary mechanism to explain the 'environmental filtering' hypothesis of Weiher & Keddy (1995, 1999), which says that species with similar niche requirements are sorted into similar habitats. Thus, according to this hypothesis, the low numbers of pioneer species in closed-canopy forests such as BCI is simply a reflection of the rarity of gap environments over evolutionary time relative to shady environments. From this evolutionary perspective, what really determines the species richness of shade-tolerant and gap species in a particular local tree community is the richness of the regional species pool and the abundance of shady and gap habitats in the metacommunity over long periods of time. This then has a trickle-down effect on α diversity in a local community such as BCI. A prediction of this perspective is that short-term changes in the disturbance regime may cause a short-term increase in the collective abundance of pioneer species, but it will have a relatively minor effect on the total number of pioneer species that are present. Life history convergence of this sort in classical niche theory is expected to lead to a loss of species through competitive exclusion, but there is no evidence to suggest that this is happening among BCI species. I believe that two major factors are at work that prevent competitive exclusion. The most important factor is the combination of dispersal and recruitment limitation. There is pervasive evidence of strong dispersal and recruitment limitation in the BCI tree community (Hubbell et al. 1999; Harms et al. 2000), and it is strong even in the best dispersers, with few exceptions (Dalling et al. 2002). The evidence for dispersal and recruitment limitation comes from a long-term study of seed rain into a network of 200 seed traps throughout the BCI 50 ha plot, with paired sets of seedling germination plots, a study now in its 18th consecutive year. First, consider dispersal limitation. During the first decade of the study, only 12 of 260 species managed to disperse at least one seed to half or more of the traps, and more than half of the tree species were collected in five or fewer traps in 10 years (Fig. 2) (Hubbell et al. 1999). The only species in the BCI forest with a seed bank are the pioneers, but even these species have only limited seed dispersal in space and time. Most seeds land within 20 m of the parent tree, and seeds of most pioneer species remain viable for only 2–3 years. The one notable exception may be Jacaranda copaia (Bignoneaceae), an emergent gap-dependent species which, genetic markers reveal, manages to disperse a sizeable fraction of its seeds long distances (Jones et al. unpublished). Evidence for strong dispersal limitation among 260 species in the BCI forest, over a 10-year sampling period, during which seeds were collected and identified weekly from 200 traps across the BCI plot. Only 12 species managed to hit over 50% of the traps in a decade, and half of all species dispersed seeds into five or fewer traps during this 10-year period. After Hubbell et al. (1999). Next there is recruitment limitation, which is also very strong. Harms et al. (2000) analysed seedling germination in the plots immediately adjacent to each seed trap, and discovered pervasive density dependence in the seed to seedling transition in all species that had sufficient seed numbers to analyse. Harms et al. measured the strength of density dependence by the slope of the regression of the log number of seedlings germinating on the log number of seeds of the same species falling into the adjacent trap. A slope of unity would indicate density independence. All of the slopes were < 1, and many effects were so strong that the slopes were actually negative (more seeds in, absolutely fewer seedlings out) (Fig. 3). Evidence for strong recruitment limitation. Histogram represents the binned slopes of the regression of log number of germinated seedlings (recruits) vs. log number of seeds of the same species collected in the adjacent trap, over all 200 traps in the BCI plot. Regression slopes of 1·0 would indicate no density dependence. However, the slopes for all species were < 1·0, indicating density-dependent mortality in the seed-to-seedling transition. Density dependence was so strong in nearly a third of the species that the slopes of the log–log relationship between seeds in to seedlings out were actually negative. Thus, these species actually recruited absolutely more poorly in sites where more seeds were deposited. After Harms et al. (2000). The importance of these findings for the present discussion is that dispersal and recruitment limitation are sufficiently strong to prevent competitive exclusion among species whose life history traits exhibit the same or very similar adaptations for the most common environments in the forest. We have not yet developed a full forest simulator for BCI that incorporates the measured effects, but simple models incorporating dispersal and recruitment limitation are fully capable of maintaining arbitrary levels of species diversity of arbitrarily competent competitors (Hurtt & Pacala 1995; Hubbell 2005). At this point, niche theorists may point out that, if host-specific density-dependent predation is included in the description of species characteristics, this is simply a broader definition of niche beyond competition that includes interactions with predators. Indeed, Chase & Leibold (2003) argue that predation risk is a legitimate component of niche. I have no problem with this, but this view of niche is not the classical paradigm. Moreover, it is not obvious how predation pressure could drive character displacement. The issue is further clouded by complexities such as the possibility of indirect competition via shared predators, sensuHolt (1977). In the case of BCI species, most of the mortality (> 95%) in the seed-to-seedling transition is actually density independent (cf. Harms et al. 2000). However, host specificity in agents of mortality, contrary to popular belief, is not required in order for recruitment limitation to be effective in promoting species coexistence. Any factor which limits seedling recruitment – even a randomly moving lawnmower – will increase the tendency of species to win sites by default, irrespective of species specificity. The second factor preventing competitive exclusion of species is the heterogeneity of the biotic and abiotic microenvironments experienced by individuals of each species. Nearly 20 years ago, we offered the hypothesis that in species-rich communities, the opportunities for directional character displacement among a large number of competing species would be low. Diffuse coevolution of many competing species would lead to convergence on the statistical average of biotic and abiotic neighbourhood conditions (Hubbell & Foster 1986b). We found in the BCI tree community that, on average, there were 14 species in the 20 nearest neighbours of each individual tree, and that conspecific trees shared, on average, only 20% of the species in their 20-individual neighbourhoods. This is related to the previous argument about life-history convergence on the most common environments. Back then, the concept of dispersal and recruitment limitation was not in the theoretical literature, but such limitation is one of the main reasons why biotic neighbourhoods are not completely mixed. If this hypothesis is true, then the long-term survival and growth performance of focal trees should be independent of the species composition of their neighbourhoods, with the exception of conspecific neighbours. We tested this hypothesis on 18 years of growth and survival data on BCI species. With few exceptions, the species identity of the focal plant's neighbours was neither quantitatively important or statistically significant (Hubbell et al. 2001; Ahumada et al. 2004; Uriarte et al. 2005). This result suggests that the direction of selection imposed by interspecific competition differs at the level of virtually every individual. There is little or no consistency in the direction of selection operating at the species level to drive character displacement in one direction or another, unlike the selection for beak shape in Darwin's finches. I suspect that this hetero-geneous selection regime is a major reason that tropical trees maintain such high levels of genetic variation and heterozygosity (Hamrick & Loveless 1986). One would expect that most BCI species are habitat generalists, and this does seem to be the case (Hubbell & Foster 1986a; Harms et al. 2001). Even the pioneer species exhibit high levels of variability. For example, consider the huge variation in growth rates among individuals of the pioneer Jacaranda coapia (Fig. 4). The variation in growth rates in this single species spans virtually the entire spectrum of growth rates of both the pioneer and the shade-tolerant functional group extremes. At this stage we cannot interpret how much of this variation is adaptive, but it does indicate that there may be problems with simple species-level trade-off arguments between survival and growth rate that we outlined previously. Some ecologists have argued that such massive intraspecific and interspecific variability implies that ecological communities are very high dimensional (e.g. Clark et al. 2001). However, if species overlap broadly because the within-species variability is far greater than the between-species variability, then simple stochastic models, such as symmetric neutral theory, may not be such a bad approximation to reality after all. Illustration of the enormous variability in growth rates of the pioneer species, Jacaranda copia (Bignoniaceaee). Graph represents a random sample of 15 Jacaranda individuals that were 1–4 cm d.b.h. saplings in 1982 that survived until the year 2000 census. The range of diameters after 18 years was from 1·0 cm d.b.h., a tree that hardly grew at all (lower heavy line), to a canopy-emergent adult of 43 cm d.b.h. (upper heavy line). This variability in just 15 Jacaranda trees spans the entire range of variation observed in growth rates across the entire BCI tree community, including shade-tolerant species. This variability is not atypical, and indicates that BCI trees overlap considerably in the distribution of their vital rates. It further indicates that the concept of limiting similarity has little applicability to demographic traits of BCI trees. Such variability also challenges the trade-off arguments applied to Fig. 1. The hypothesis of functional equivalence can only be taken so far, but the main point of this paper is that there are both empirical and theoretical grounds for taking the hypothesis seriously, at least in the tropical tree communities I have studied. It is almost certainly the case that the hypothesis will apply better to some communities and functional groups than others. I suspect it will be less often true in communities of mobile animals, but this question will be for the experts on those communities to answer. What continues to surprise me, however, is how far one can get with a neutral theory based on the strong assumption of functional equivalence. Although critics have rightly noted that non-neutral theories can also produce many of the same patterns, to me this is not the main point of neutral theory. More realistic – but also more complex – theories ought to fit the data better if the theorist knows what he or she is doing. To me the most interesting and challenging question of all is why neutral theory performs as well as it does, given the assumptions it makes. For me, neutral theory has been a welcome conceptual advance because it is a theory of diversity that derives naturally from fundamental demographic processes in population biology. For example, it is both amazing and encouraging that one can derive the most famous measure of species diversity, Fisher's α (Fisher et al. 1943) very simply and directly from the theory (Volkov et al. 2003), and that this number turns out to be proportional to the speciation rate. It is results like this that fuel my belief that neutral theory is capturing something fundamentally true about the aggregate statistical behaviour of biodiversity on large, spatially structured landscapes. Only time will tell if my belief is correct.",W2132230890,True,0.966826856136322

Aggregation among heterospecific individuals may require particular during‐life traits, for example, traits limiting competition for space or resources. But is aggregation also facilitated by after‐life traits accelerating decomposition of plant litters, notably through synergy among co‐decomposing litters? We investigated the role of leaf traits, litter traits and litter‐mixture decomposition in the spatial aggregation of individuals of pairs of grassland species in a long‐term mesocosm experiment. We related aggregation between pairs of species to mean and dissimilarity in (a) during‐life traits related to resource‐acquisition and clonal dispersal, (b) after‐life traits related to decomposition and (c) rate and synergy of decomposition. In most years, aggregation of heterospecific individuals strongly increased with means of (a) during‐life clonal traits reducing competition for space, and (b) after‐life traits increasing litter decomposition. Trait dissimilarities had comparatively less influence. Interestingly, in the last year, synergistic decomposition among litters improved species aggregation. Overall, after‐life interactions due to fast and synergistic decomposition appear to increase during‐life aggregation between individuals of different plant species. We introduce the concept of ‘associational decomposition’, equivalent to associational resistance, but mediated via decomposers rather than enemies.

Trait‐mediated interactions between predator and prey result from non‐consumptive predator effects changing behavioural and/or life history traits of prey. However, in biological control the occurrence of trait‐mediated interactions between predators, prey and plants has been largely ignored. Here, we show that non‐consumptive predator effects on prey cascade down to the plant in an agro‐ecological food chain. The study system consisted of the predatory mites P. persimilis and N. californicus, the herbivorous non‐target prey western flower thrips F. occidentalis and the host plant bean. Irrespective of predator species and risk posed to prey, the presence of predator eggs led to increased ambulation, increased mortality and decreased oviposition of thrips. Furthermore, the presence of predator eggs reduced leaf damage caused by thrips. To our knowledge this is the first experimental evidence suggesting a positive trophic cascade triggered by non‐consumptive predator effects on non‐target prey in an augmentative biological control system.",W2039786791,True,0.9878575801849365
https://doi.org/10.1890/08-2291.1,Intraspecific competition between co‐infecting parasite strains enhances host survival in African trypanosomes,"It is becoming increasingly clear that under natural conditions parasitic infections commonly consist of co‐infections with multiple conspecific strains. Multiple‐strain infections lead to intraspecific interactions and may have important ecological and evolutionary effects on both hosts and parasites. However, experimental evidence on intraspecific competition or facilitation in infections has been scarce because of the technical challenges of distinguishing and tracking individual co‐infecting strains. To overcome this limitation, we engineered transgenic strains of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, the causal agent of human African sleeping sickness. Different strains were transfected with fluorescence genes of different colors to make them visually distinguishable in order to investigate the effects of multiple‐strain infections on parasite population dynamics and host fitness. We infected mice either with each strain alone or with mixes of two strains. Our results show a strong mutual competitive suppression of co‐infecting T. brucei strains very early in infection. This mutual suppression changes within‐host parasite dynamics and alleviates the effects of infection on the host. The strength of suppression depends on the density of the co‐infecting strain, and differences in life‐history traits between the strains determine the consequences of strain–strain competition for the host. Unexpectedly, co‐infection with a less virulent strain significantly enhances host survival (+15%). Analysis of the strain dynamics reveals that this is due to the suppression of the density of the more virulent strain (−33%), whose degree of impact ultimately determines the physical condition of the host. The competitive suppression is likely caused by allelopathic interference or by apparent competition mediated by strain‐specific immune responses. These findings highlight the importance of intraspecific variation for parasite−parasite and parasite−host interactions. To fully understand parasite and disease dynamics, the genetic diversity of infections must be taken into account. Through changes in parasite dynamics, intraspecific variation may further affect transmission dynamics and select for increased virulence of each strain. The precise mechanisms underlying mutual suppression are not yet understood but may be exploitable to fight this devastating parasite. Our results are therefore not only of basic ecological interest investigating an important form of intraspecific competition, but may also have applied relevance for public health.",W2142726382,True,0.9769548177719116
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.4320,Extending trait dispersion across trophic levels: Predator assemblages act as top‐down filters on prey communities,"Studies of community assembly typically focus on the effects of abiotic environmental filters and stabilizing competition on functional trait dispersion within single trophic levels. Predation is a well-known driver of community diversity and composition, yet the role of functionally diverse predator communities in filtering prey community traits has received less attention. We examined functionally diverse communities of predators (fishes) and prey (epifaunal crustaceans) in eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds in two northern California estuaries to evaluate the filtering effects of predator traits on community assembly and how filters acting on predators influence their ability to mediate prey community assembly. Fish traits related to bottom orientation were correlated with more clustered epifauna communities, and epifauna were generally overdispersed while fishes were clustered, suggesting prey may be pushed to disparate areas of trait space to avoid capture by benthic sit-and-wait predators. We also found correlations between the trait dispersions of predator and prey communities that strengthened after accounting for the effects of habitat filters on predator dispersion, suggesting that habitat filtering effects on predator species pools may hinder their ability to affect prey community assembly. Our results present compelling observational evidence that specific predator traits have measurable impacts on the community assembly of prey, inviting experimental tests of predator trait means on community assembly and explicit comparisons of how the relative effects of habitat filters and intraguild competition on predators impact their ability to affect prey community assembly. Integrating our understanding of traits at multiple trophic levels can help us better predict the impacts of community composition on food web dynamics as regional species pools shift with climate change and anthropogenic introductions.",W4398132749,True,0.9811447858810425
https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2010.0877,Diet and hormonal manipulation reveal cryptic genetic variation: implications for the evolution of novel feeding strategies,"When experiencing resource competition or abrupt environmental change, animals often must transition rapidly from an ancestral diet to a novel, derived diet. Yet, little is known about the proximate mechanisms that mediate such rapid evolutionary transitions. Here, we investigated the role of diet-induced, cryptic genetic variation in facilitating the evolution of novel resource-use traits that are associated with a new feeding strategy—carnivory—in tadpoles of spadefoot toads (genus Spea ). We specifically asked whether such variation in trophic morphology and fitness is present in Scaphiopus couchii, a species that serves as a proxy for ancestral Spea. We also asked whether corticosterone, a vertebrate hormone produced in response to environmental signals, mediates the expression of this variation. Specifically, we compared broad-sense heritabilities of tadpoles fed different diets or treated with exogenous corticosterone, and found that novel diets can expose cryptic genetic variation to selection, and that diet-induced hormones may play a role in revealing this variation. Our results therefore suggest that cryptic genetic variation may have enabled the evolutionary transition to carnivory in Spea tadpoles, and that such variation might generally facilitate rapid evolutionary transitions to novel diets.",W2115499015,True,0.9657473564147949
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13684,The shape of the predator biomass distribution affects biological pest control services in agricultural landscapes,"Abstract Understanding how community composition of service‐providing organisms affects ecosystem functioning is a key challenge in ecology. Although it has been proposed that taxonomic diversity and functional traits mediate this relationship, how several facets of community structure affect the delivery of key ecosystem services remains to be explored. In this study, we investigated how abundance, taxonomic richness as well as the shape of biomass distribution in predator communities affect biological pest control services in vineyard landscapes. Our analyses were based on a dataset combining samples of arthropod predators, measures of predation rates of grape pests and characterization of environmental covariables for 42 fields located in South‐Western France. We found that beside the abundance or the taxonomic richness of predators, the shape of biomass distribution (mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis of the distribution) influences the level of biological control. Predator communities largely dominated by low biomass species provided the bulk of biological control services. Lower levels of predation resulted from increased proportions of large biomass species and more evenly distributed biomass values in the communities. Our results indicate that the top‐down control provided by low biomass species decreases as the relative proportion of large biomass species increases in the predator community. This suggests that biological control may be affected by negative interactions (e.g. intraguild predation, behavioural interactions) between predators arising from the recruitment of large individuals in the community. Our study revealed that the shape of biomass distribution is a major aspect of functional diversity in predator communities providing insights into the mechanisms that link biodiversity and ecosystem services. While our study focuses on biomass, considering other traits involved in trophic interactions may increase our ability to predict the level of biological control in ecosystems.

Coevolution has since Darwin been considered a potential path leading to adaptive diversification that could explain the emergence of ecological networks of biotic interactions that harbour multiple interacting species (eg, pollination networks and food webs). Here, we present adaptive dynamics, a powerful tool of evolutionary invasion analysis that explores how quantitative traits undergo incremental evolution, to exploring the emergence of multi‐species networks through coevolution. Specifically, we exemplify the feasibility of using adaptive dynamics to investigate trait evolution in 4 ecological networks, driven, respectively, by resource competition, trophic interactions, as well as bipartite mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. We use a set of ordinary differential equations to describe, at different paces, the population dynamics and trait dynamics of involved species assemblages. Through computing ecological equilibrium, invasion fitness, selection gradient and evolutionary singularity, and testing for evolutionary stability and the coexistence criterion of mutual invasibility, we illustrate the typical evolutionary dynamics and the criteria of evolutionary stability and branching in these ecological networks. Results highlight the importance of the form of trait‐mediated interaction kernel (ie, interaction strength as a function of trait difference) to adaptive diversification in these coevolutionary systems. We conclude by advocating that biotic interactions between two species can indeed lead to diffuse and even escape‐and‐radiate coevolution, making the emerged ecological networks an ideal model for studying complex adaptive systems.",W2760473981,True,0.9893709421157837

While such emergent predator effects are ubiquitous in natural communities, the strength of these effects varies among studies and systems, making it difficult to predict a priory how changes in predator diversity influence prey suppression. Thus, identifying general scaling rules which can explain this variation of non-independent effects is vital for modelling natural communities and how they respond to biodiversity loss. Body size is a key trait determining the nature and strength of ecological interactions. While great progress has been made using allometric relationships to predict the interaction strength of predator-prey pairs, it is unknown whether similar relationships explain variation in the strength of NCEs, and how they are related to consumptive effects. Here, we experimentally manipulate the relative size difference of multiple predators to determine whether NCEs follow general allometric scaling relationships in an aquatic multi-predator system. Results demonstrate that the presence and strength of NCEs can vary dramatically across predator combinations. However, this variation scaled predictably with the size ratio of predators, increasing the size difference among predators increased NCEs. This pattern was driven by a size-mediated shift in 'food web motif' from competition to intraguild predation and a positive correlation of NCEs and intraguild predation rate. Results indicate that models which assume that consumers have independent effects are particularly likely to make erroneous predictions when predators differ substantially in size, but simple allometric relationships of NCEs could be used to correct this bias.",W2146516835,True,0.9811927676200867

Resource availability is a particularly dynamic and potent environmental driver of within‐host infection dynamics (temporal patterns of growth, reproduction, parasite production and survival). We developed, parameterised and validated a model for resource‐explicit infection dynamics by incorporating a parasitism module into dynamic energy budget theory. The model mechanistically explained the dynamic multivariate responses of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni and its intermediate host snail to variation in resources and host density. At the population level, feedbacks mediated by resource competition could create a unimodal relationship between snail density and human risk of exposure to schistosomes. Consequently, weak snail control could backfire if reductions in snail density release remaining hosts from resource competition. If resource competition is strong and relevant to schistosome production in nature, it could inform control strategies.",W2793588632,True,0.9142988324165344

Beyond describing grassland community patterns along gradients in P availability, it remains unclear how individual species with different strategies respond to increasing phosphorus. Here we studied intraspecific variability of leaf functional traits in response to soil phosphorus, for species with contrasting resource‐use strategies. Methods We set up a pot experiment with communities containing four species, assembled from a pool of 20 mesotrophic grassland species growing along a soil P gradient. Species selection included various growth forms (grasses vs forbs) and resource‐use strategies (acquisitive vs conservative resource use). We measured three variables characterizing the (a)biotic environmental context: bioavailable soil P concentration, total community biomass as a proxy for the intensity of competition, and the proportional biomass of a species in the community as a proxy for its competitive dominance. We investigated the effect of this environmental context on the expression of two leaf traits, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC). Results We found an acquisitive trait expression within species (increase in SLA and decrease in LDMC) in response to increased soil P supply and a conservative trait expression (decrease in SLA and increase in LDMC) in response to an increase in total community biomass. Importantly, the trait responses to the environmental context were generally consistent for species representing very different resource‐use strategies and growth forms. Conclusions Species responded with a shift from an acquisitive to a conservative trait expression in response to limited resources; i.e., driven by a decrease in soil phosphorus concentration or an increase in total community biomass. Unexpectedly, the intraspecific variability in response to the changing environmental conditions was not clearly mediated by the species’ strategy. These findings show that plant ecological strategies are probably not the main driver for intraspecific trait variability in an experimental grassland community.",W4392653617,True,0.9704970121383667

We compared risk effects with the overall top-down effect (including consumption) by gluing the chelicers of wolf spiders to prevent them from killing the prey. In a field experiment, we created three treatments that included either: (i) intact ('predation') wolf spiders; (ii) wolf spiders with glued chelicers ('risk spiders'); or (iii) no (sub-) adult wolf spiders. Young wolf spiders were reduced by their (sub-) adult congeners. Densities of sheetweb spiders (Linyphiidae), a known intraguild prey of wolf spiders, were equally reduced by the presence of risk and predation wolf spiders. Plant- and leafhoppers (Auchenorrhyncha) showed the inverse pattern of higher densities in the presence of both risk and predation wolf spiders. We conclude that (sub-) adult wolf spiders acted as top predators, which reduced densities of intermediate predators and thereby enhanced herbivores.

We quantified the similarity of neighbors in terms of key ecological traits that mediate these interactions, as well as the similarity of herbivore communities. We show that phytochemical similarity and shared herbivore communities are associated with decreased growth and survival at the sapling stage, a key bottleneck in the life cycle of tropical trees. None of the traits associated with resource acquisition affect plant performance, indicating that competition between neighbors may not shape local tree diversity.

Condition-specific competition, wherein competitive superiority varies with the abiotic environmental gradient, has been proposed as the major structuring force behind such distributions. However, few studies have elucidated the underlying mechanisms, such as behavioral and demographic processes. We conducted laboratory experiments to examine the effects of temperature on interspecific competition between two stream salmonid fishes, Salvelinus malma and S. leucomaenis. The two species have a largely allopatric altitudinal distribution on Hokkaido Island, Japan, proposed to be the result of temperature-mediated competition. We tested predictions that at a higher temperature (12°C), S. leucomaenis would dominate over S. malma in aggressive interactions, foraging performance, growth, and survival, but become subordinate at a lower temperature (6°C). Indeed, S. leucomaenis initiated a greater number of aggressive acts, attained greater food intake and greater growth, and finally excluded S. malma at the higher temperature. Although the two species initiated a similar number of aggressive acts and foraged equally well at the lower temperature, S. leucomaenis achieved a higher growth rate than S. malma; however, the latter eventually became numerically dominant. Clear competitive release in allopatry occurred for S. malma only at the higher temperature, providing direct evidence of condition-specific asymmetric competition. The lower distribution boundary of S. malma in Hokkaido streams may therefore be determined by temperature-mediated condition-specific competition. However, mechanisms determining the upper distribution boundary of S. leucomaenis could not be fully explained by the competitive results at lower temperature, but required an understanding of how effects of competition interacted with species-specific physiological traits. Thus, species distributions along an environmental gradient cannot be solely explained by a simple model of condition-specific competition without considering mechanistic linkages among behavioral and physiological responses to the environment, resource use, and demographic processes.",W2072147251,True,0.9969538450241089
https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.17037,Competition‐induced transgenerational plasticity influences competitive interactions and leaf decomposition of offspring,"Summary Phenotypic plasticity, within and across generations (transgenerational plasticity), allows organisms and their progeny to adapt to the environment without modification of the underlying DNA. Recent findings suggest that epigenetic modifications are important mediators of such plasticity. However, empirical studies have, so far, mainly focused on plasticity in response to abiotic factors, overlooking the response to competition. We tested for within‐generation and transgenerational phenotypic plasticity triggered by plant–plant competition intensity, and we tested whether it was mediated via DNA methylation, using the perennial, apomictic herb Taraxacum brevicorniculatum in four coordinated experiments. We then tested the consequences of transgenerational plasticity affecting competitive interactions of the offspring and ecosystem processes, such as decomposition. We found that, by promoting differences in DNA methylation, offspring of plants under stronger competition developed faster and presented more resource‐conservative phenotypes. Further, these adjustments associated with less degradable leaves, which have the potential to reduce nutrient turnover and might, in turn, favour plants with more conservative traits. Greater parental competition enhanced competitive abilities of the offspring, by triggering adaptive phenotypic plasticity, and decreased offspring leaf decomposability. Our results suggest that competition‐induced transgenerational effects could promote rapid adaptations and species coexistence and feed back on biodiversity assembly and nutrient cycling.",W3094948797,True,0.9759606122970581
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.70039,Coexistence of coinvading species with mutualism and competition,"Abstract All interactions between multiple species invading together (coinvasion) must be accounted for to predict species coexistence patterns across space. Mutualisms, particularly, are known to influence species' population dynamics and their invasive ability (e.g., mycorrhizal fungi with partner plants). Yet, while modeling coinvasion, their role in mediating coexistence is overlooked. Here, we build a spatially explicit model of coinvasion of two competing plant species with a shared fungal mutualist to study how mutualism and competition interact to shape the local and regional coexistence of competitors. We observe four main results. First, mutualist presence generates regional coexistence between competitors even when local coexistence between them is impossible. Second, increasing partner mutualist dispersal leads to abrupt changes in competitor coexistence outcomes. Third, differences in mutualist partner dependence and competitive ability interact to produce a variety of local and regional coexistence outcomes. Fourth, asymmetry in the dispersal ability arising from dependence‐dispersal trade‐offs leads to greater exclusion of species less dependent on mutualist partners for growth. In toto, incorporating mutualism‐specific trait trade‐offs and dispersal asymmetries into coinvasion models offers new insights into regional coexistence and invasive species distributions.",W4407908292,True,0.9372382760047913

Patch structures have been interpreted as a result of the prevalence of facilitation phenomena in highly stressful environments. Several mechanisms have been proposed in order to explain the factors that control the existence of these clumped structures. However, they have not been evaluated in these mountains. Our hypothesis is that patchy structure in high mountain Mediterranean vegetation is a consequence of facilitative and competitive interactions in a very harsh environment which ultimately involve strong localized effects on soil properties. Our results show that levels of soil nutrients were higher under vegetation patches than in bare ground areas, confirming the hypothesis of an amelioration of soil resources under canopies. Pairwise associations and repulsions suggest the existence of two contrasting composition stages. Contrasting models relating patch species composition (cover and biomass) and soil resources indicated a weak relationship between species features and soil nutrient levels. Finally, structural modeling showed that patch size has a relevant but indirect effect on soil resource levels through grass and total biomass. We conclude that patch structure and dynamics in high Mediterranean mountain communities may be partly controlled by an endogenous process involving facilitation and competition for soil key resources. These interactions may operate through some community traits related to patch size but not to composition.",W2173071604,True,0.9656276106834412
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10144-010-0235-4,Indirect interactions in the microbial world: specificities and similarities to plant–insect systems,"Abstract Trophic interactions between bacteria, viruses, and protozoan predators play crucial roles in structuring aquatic microbial communities and regulating microbe‐mediated ecosystem functions (biogeochemical processes). In this microbial food web, protozoan predators and viruses share bacteria as a common resource, and protozoan predators can kill viruses [intraguild predation (IGP)] and vice versa, even though these latter processes are probably of less importance. However, protozoan predators (IG predator) and viruses (IG prey) generally occur together in various environments, and this cannot be fully explained by the classic IGP models. In addition, controlled experiments have often demonstrated that protozoan predators have apparently positive effects on viral activity. These surprising patterns can be explained by indirect interactions between them via induced trait changes in bacterial assemblages, which can be compared with trait‐mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) in terrestrial plant–insect systems. Here, we review some trait changes in bacterial assemblages that may positively affect the activities and abundance of viruses. It has been suggested that in bacterial assemblages, protozoan predation may enhance growth conditions for individual bacteria and induce both phenotypic trait changes at the individual (e.g., filament‐forming bacteria) and group level as a result of changes in bacterial community composition (e.g., species dominance). We discuss the specificities of aquatic microbial systems and attempt find functional similarities between aquatic microbial systems and terrestrial plant–insect systems with regard to TMII function.",W2066895585,True,0.9337260723114014
https://doi.org/10.1086/695832,Evolution as a Coexistence Mechanism: Does Genetic Architecture Matter?,"Species sharing a prey or a predator species may go extinct due to exploitative or apparent competition. We examine whether evolution of the shared species acts as a coexistence mechanism and to what extent the answer depends on the genetic architecture underlying trait evolution. In our models of exploitative and apparent competition, the shared species evolves its defense or prey use. Evolving species are either haploid or diploid. A single locus pleiotropically determines prey nutritional quality and predator attack rates. When pleiotropy is sufficiently antagonistic (e.g. nutritional prey are harder to capture), eco-evolutionary assembly culminates in one of two stable states supporting only two species. When pleiotropy is weakly antagonistic or synergistic, assembly is intransitive: species-genotype pairs are cyclically displaced by rare invasions of the missing genotypes or species. This intransitivity allows for coexistence if, along its equilibria, the geometric mean of recovery rates exceeds the geometric mean of loss rates of the rare genotypes or species. By affecting these rates, synergistic pleiotropy can mediate coexistence, while antagonistic pleiotropy does not. For diploid populations experiencing weak antagonistic pleiotropy, superadditive allelic contributions to fitness can mitigate coexistence via an eco-evolutionary storage effect. Density-dependence and mutations also promote coexistence. These results highlight how the efficacy of evolution as a coexistence mechanism may depend on the underlying genetic architecture.",W2521695164,True,0.9833298325538635
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01936.x,Positive effect of shade on plant growth: amelioration of stress or active regulation of growth rate?,"Summary 1. While plant competition for light has received considerable attention, the facilitative effect that shading can have on plants and the role of species‐specific adaptations in mediating this phenomenon are still poorly understood. Evidence is accumulating, however, that positive interactions can play as important a role in community structuring as has been shown for competition. 2. We examined interspecific variation in growth responses to shade using 46 temperate grassland species grown for 10 weeks in a common garden under identical soil conditions but at different levels of shading. The importance of morphological plasticity and habitat preference as species traits determining the net effect of shading on plant growth was tested. 3. Moderate shade (50% daylight) had, on average, a net facilitative effect on plant mass. Plant growth in the 25% daylight treatment was not significantly different from that in full daylight, and it was only when 90% of natural light was made unavailable that shaded plants attained a significantly lower dry mass than plants in full daylight. 4. Species that exhibited the most pronounced reduction in specific leaf area and increased allocation to roots in full compared with 50% daylight were least facilitated by shading. This finding supports the hypothesis that morphological plasticity is an important trait determining the strength of facilitative interactions. 5. The growth response to shade was also dependent on species’ ecological optima, with species characteristic of nutrient‐poor or dry habitats most facilitated by shade. Greater growth enhancement by shade in grassland stress‐tolerant plants is surprising because such species frequently occupy unproductive vegetation with little shade and should therefore be adapted to high irradiance. This result calls into question the notion that a positive effect of shade on growth always reflects stress amelioration. 6. Synthesis. Our study demonstrates a widespread ability of plant species to decouple growth from resource availability and challenges our understanding of the processes determining plant productivity.",W1566296928,True,0.9822930097579956
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2009.01673.x,Adaptive foragers and community ecology: linking individuals to communities and ecosystems,"Thirteen years ago, the journal Evolutionary Ecology ran a special issue commemorating 30 years of the influence of foraging theory on population and community ecology (Schmitz 1997). This era began with the classic foraging theories of MacArthur & Pianka (1966), Emlen (1966)Fretwell & Lucas (1969), and Charnov (1976a,b), and was followed by the seminal contributions of Pyke, Pulliam & Charnov (1977), Schoener (1971, 1973, 1976, 1983, 1987), Belovsky (1978) and Stephens & Krebs (1986). These contributions are noteworthy for their emphasis on making predictions about diet choice, habitat selection and territory size, as well as the degree of consumer specialization and generalism. Subsequently, a bout of empirical and theoretical work reinforced the notion that foraging behaviour, and more generally adaptive behaviour, is critical to understanding the structure of ecological communities and the dynamics of the populations within them (Schoener 1971, 1973, 1976, 1983, 1986, 1987, 1989; Holt 1983; Belovsky 1986a,b; Fryxell & Lundberg 1994). It is now well established that animals adaptively choose their diets, shift their habitat use and alter their morphology in response to temporal and spatial variation in resource availability, as well as the presence of predators and parasites. Optimal foraging remains the central theory linking resource and consumer traits to patterns of resource selection. Yet, even after 40 years of development, there are precious few advances towards truly synthesizing the connections between individuals, populations and large interconnected food webs (Schoener 1989; Schmitz 1997; Abrams 2008). Nevertheless, we suggest that food web biology will emerge in the next 10 years as a new focal point for understanding the interplay between adaptive behaviour, population dynamics and the complexity and structure of ecosystems. Food webs, the networks of feeding links between species, are central to our understanding of ecosystem structure, stability and function. Studies of food webs have informed us on issues ranging from how the loss of species may initiate cascades of extinctions to the types of structural regularities that may promote population and community stability. Moreover, the use of foraging rules and optimization in various large-scale models of food web structure and dynamics is growing again (Williams & Martinez 2000; Kondoh 2003, 2006, 2007; Loeuille & Loreau 2005; Beckerman, Petchey & Warren 2006; Brose, Williams & Martinez 2006b; Brose et al. 2006a; Loeuille et al. 2007; Petchey et al. 2008), perhaps inspired by the contributions in Evolutionary Ecology 13 years ago (Schmitz 1997). Despite this optimism, the typical empirical food web analysis today still falls into one of two categories, each with its own limitations. The first, the static category, aims to answer questions such as who eats whom, how many trophic links are there, and what are the patterns of trophic links? The second, the dynamics category, aims to address questions such as what happens when one species eats another species and, more generally, what are the effects of particular patterns of trophic interactions on population dynamics, stability and community structure (e.g. Gross et al. 2009). This static/dynamic dichotomy remains the norm and has contributed many insights into the structure and dynamics of real communities. However, through this Special Feature, we hope to reinforce that foraging behaviours, and the associated, broadly defined set of individual traits that make up behaviours of individuals, represent one of the most fundamental links between the static and dynamic approaches. To begin, we provide a general framework that draws together – and provides motivating conceptual links between – individual traits, adaptive behaviour, food-web structure, population dynamics, and community stability. Our rationale for proposing that adaptive foraging (traits/behaviour) and food webs must be linked is that foraging traits form the interface between selection pressures and population dynamics (Fig. 1). There is no linear way to present the dynamic feedback between biotic selection pressures on particular organisms, the traits of those organisms, the ensuing dynamics of both the traits and the populations, and the consequences for the complexity and structure of a community or ecosystem. Figure 1 does, however, present the key concept that phenotypes are both subject to natural selection and determine patterns of consumption, population growth and population dynamics. Food web properties rely on and are influenced by individual and species-specific traits. Traits are the phenotype that both undergo natural selection and underpin patterns of consumption, population growth and population dynamics. We highlight here a research programme that is enhancing links between selection, individuals' traits and community structure, that sits at the confluence of ecological and evolutionary research. Resources ultimately drive patterns of physiology, morphology, behaviour, and life history, and thus generate strong and weak interactions among competitors and predators (Fig. 1, middle). Consumers generate comparable changes in prey/resource behaviour, morphology and life history that further affect interactions among the prey, competitors, and their own natural enemies (Fig. 1, middle). Here, we classify these changes in physiology, morphology, behaviour, and life history under the general concept of adaptive behaviour, where behaviour can be defined at multiple scales. These changes in resource and consumer traits simultaneously alter the pattern of who eats whom and the dynamics that result from the interactions (Fig. 1, middle to right). Evolution, driven via selection pressures, changes these traits. Yet is important to realize that the interactions per se and the dynamics that result from them are selection pressures (Fig. 1, left and right to middle). This simplified illustration of different levels of ecological organization (individual fitness, adaptively defined traits, species interactions, and community structure) underscores how and why traits related to foraging and eating are central to our understanding of food webs. Figure 2 expands this perspective to highlight various groups of traits that have played and continue to play an important role in food-web research. The left-hand column emphasizes the need for a broad definition of adaptive behaviour across three hierarchical scales – individuals, populations and small community modules and up to entire food-web networks and ecosystems. The techniques, theories and models for assessing the role of traits have been varied. Most techniques centre around integrating various concepts from optimal foraging theory, while some have leveraged generic optimization methods to explore the evolutionary ecology implications of embedding traits directly in dynamic models (e.g.Ives & Dobson 1987). A perspective on groups of traits that have and continue to play an important role in food-web research. The performance of individuals, the dynamics of populations, the structure of networks, and the dynamics of ecosystems are influenced by these various traits and the focus of large bodies of theoretical and empirical research. The research we highlight here suggests that enhancing this link between traits, theory and small and large networks will be very productive at providing a mechanistic explanation of stability, complexity and ecosystem structure. Perhaps most importantly, a few common channels of creativity are recognizable in the figure. Body size continues to feature heavily throughout research at different scales. It is represented even more often when one considers allometry as a specific focus on the ecological implications of body size (Schoener 1989; Cohen et al. 1993; Belovsky 1997; Jennings & Warr 2003; Berlow et al. 2004; Emmerson & Raffaelli 2004; Loeuille & Loreau 2005; Brose et al. 2006a; Petchey et al. 2008). Body size is further implicated in understanding the role of growth and ontogeny (e.g. life history) and in creating temporal, spatial and morphological refuges (e.g. species interaction traits) (Werner & Hall 1977; Sih 1982b, 1987; Werner 1992; Werner & Anholt 1993; Anholt & Werner 1995). These examples complement classical representations of habitat selection as a behaviour (Emlen 1966; MacArthur & Pianka 1966). Recent advances in understanding information quality and detection has stimulated productive lines of research into perception, signalling and learning as traits potentially influencing interactions and dynamics. However, all but a handful of this research stops at the foraging, habitat-selection and/or mate-choice scale, and does not extend to population dynamics and larger food webs. For example, there is a growing interest in how different types of information are accumulated (Valone 2006) and how this information affects habitat selection and the expression of defensive traits (Alonzo 2002; Luttbeg 2002; Stamps & Davis 2006; Turner, Turner & Lappi 2006). Further examples include the role and quality of alarm signals with respect to predation (Beauchamp & Ruxton 2007; Rowland et al. 2008; Chittka, Skorupski & Raine 2009; Higginson & Ruxton 2009). A notable exception is work by Luttbeg, which extends questions about information quality to dynamics games of more than two species (Luttbeg & Schmitz 2000; Luttbeg, Rowe & Mangel 2003). As Sih, Hanser & McHugh (2009) indicate in their recent perspective on linking social network theory to behavioural ecology, the links between network science, behavioural ecology and food webs can only grow. Interaction strengths, once a source of major debate (and perhaps still so, see Paine 1992; Laska & Wootton 1998; Abrams 2001a; Berlow et al. 2004) have emerged as a cornerstone of defining and measuring dynamics incorporating both species identity and more importantly, species traits (Paine 1992; Wootton 1997; Berlow et al. 1999, 2004; Ings et al. 2009). There is a long history of including various species traits in models of competition and predation (and disease), frequently inspired and motivated by optimal foraging theory (Schoener 1973, 1976; Sih 1981, 1982a; Holt 1983; Schoener 1983, 1986; Abrams 1987a, b; Schoener 1987, 1989; Sih 1987; Fryxell & Lundberg 1993, 1994). And not at all disconnected from this is the current challenge of partitioning direct and indirect effects, of varying strength, in food webs of varying size, to the categories of density or trait-mediated indirect effect (Schmitz, Beckerman & O'Brien 1997; Schmitz 1998; Peacor & Werner 2001; Schmitz, Krivan & Ovadia 2004; Bolnick & Preisser 2005; Preisser, Bolnick & Benard 2005; Abrams 2008). However, the large-scale food-web research programme has not embraced traits in the same way that research on smaller communities has. It should be no surprise to many people that, historically, the majority of this trait-inspired research on food webs and populations dynamics has been restricted to simple interactions between individuals within a single species or among fewer than four species, i.e. in small networks (see also Ives & Dobson 1987; Abrams 1996; Abrams & Matsuda 1996; Abrams 2000; Kokko & Ruxton 2000; Abrams 2001b). With a few exceptions, the focus of this research has been on understanding the role of traits in the stability and persistence of these small communities (but see Kondoh 2003; Loeuille & Loreau 2005). Even the briefest look at Fig. 2 confirms that only a handful of specific traits have been linked to large network/food-web questions (see below), despite the more general consideration of traits in small-scale food webs. One of the most encouraging patterns in the past 5 years is that two of the newest aspects of food web biology – binary-network analysis and the large-scale evolutionary–dynamic analysis – are increasingly making use of one of the oldest motivating theories in behavioural, population and community ecology: that of adaptive behaviour/optimal foraging. The cascade model (Cohen & Newman 1985), the niche model (Williams & Martinez 2000) and subsequent alterations of the niche model (Cattin et al. 2004) use probabilistic rules to encode established empirical and theoretical rules about foraging. The dynamic and evolutionary models of Kondoh (2003, 2006) and Loeuille and Loreau (2005) use simple rules of energy gain to add adaptive trait dynamics to explorations of stability and complexity in large communities. Our own work (Beckerman, Petchey & Warren 2006; Petchey et al. 2008) uses the contingency model of optimal foraging and allometry to predict both the complexity and structure of observed food webs. Where to now? With all of this history, do we really need a new vision? We think so. 1, 2 illustrate that a great deal of effort has been made to integrate traits into what we consider small-scale food webs. We advocate three over-arching objectives for the future. First, we must better synthesize and begin to capture generalities from across trait types among the small network studies (see Abrams 2009; Stouffer 2009). Second, we must further extend the use of traits and theories successful at providing insight at the small scale to the larger, network-size food webs (see Brose 2009; Kondoh 2009; Loeuille 2009 and Stouffer 2009). Finally, we must also recognize the opportunity to link advances from small-scale dynamics involving traits to the larger networks, understanding that the small, tractable communities are what network biologists know as modules or motifs in the larger networks (see Stouffer 2009). In essence, we expect that the details from the work at small scales will provide node-specific and biologically relevant information to advance the current phenomenological focus of networks (Proulx, Promislow & Phillips 2005; Bianconi, Pin & Marsili 2009; Sih, Hanser & McHugh 2009). There are currently precious few examples of these efforts. This Special Feature contains five papers that together support a vision for the future of food-web research centred on adaptive behaviour. They are authored by people who might be considered grand masters of the field as well as people just entering academia. Importantly, they provide perspective and insight while stimulating thought about the use and importance of traits across various scales. It is this emphasis that we champion and we hope it will lead towards a synthetic definition of food-web biology in which traits, dynamics and structure are linked together. The feature begins with a remarkable and notable piece of work by Peter Abrams (2009), who for the first time provides a review of his contribution to understanding the stability, dynamics and contingency of simple models of a few species. One of the core features of Abrams' work over the past decades has been a reliance on what we all consider to be simple models and always clear assumptions. His attempts to include traits associated with foraging and trade-offs in the models have continued to develop our understanding of how traits matter a great deal and how dynamics, persistence and stability are contingent upon model assumptions. His overview provides insight into five over-arching themes and questions that drive all of his research. The article by Nicolas Loeuille (Loeuille 2009) provides another overview, this time from the perspective of large-scale population dynamics. Loeuille's research with Michel Loreau is a fundamental contribution to understanding how evolution of foraging traits and constraint on species' diets can shape the complexity, structure and dynamics of food webs (see also Kondoh 2003). His more recent forays into metacommunity ecology maintain the focus at a large scale, and his paper here helps draw together methods and insights that come from defining traits among many species at these large scales. The works by Uli Brose (Brose 2009) and by Michio Kondoh (Kondoh 2009) bring us directly to one of the most common traits used in food-web biology: size. Brose reviews the increasing body of empirical evidence about the allometry of foraging traits, such as handling times, maximum ingestion rates and attack rates, while highlighting some of the gaps. For example, there is relatively little information about how the shape of a consumer's functional response (Type I, Type II, Type III, or somewhere in amongst these) is influenced by the size of prey and predator. Despite the need for more and better empirical information (as always!), Brose reviews models of how individual foraging behaviour, expressed both in prey to predator mass ratios and the distribution of trophic interactions, can resolve one of the longest standing puzzles in ecology: how very diverse and complex ecosystem can be dynamically stable. Although overall body size is of great importance for foraging behaviour, considerable variation around allometric relationships indicates the potential for other traits to have strong effects. Michio Kondoh presents an analysis investigating how cognitive capacity and the ability and rate at which organisms can adapt behaviourally (e.g. learning) can influence the relationship between predator and prey. In particular, Kondoh's contribution documents an intriguing relationship that suggest predator–prey pairs (i.e. diet choice) are determined not only by overall organismal size, but also on relative brain sizes. While the underlying causes of these relationships remain open to speculation, he proposes that arms races in the cognitive ability of prey and predator are a possibility. Such arms races have the potential to strongly influence population dynamics and community structure. Finally, the work of Daniel Stouffer (Stouffer 2009) offers a critical review of many of the phenomenological and population-level models of food webs, with an eye towards asking two fundamental questions: do we need the population-level models and, if we do, do the small sets and patterns (motifs) of interactions among species (e.g. Abrams 2009) offer sufficient insight into patterns at the large scale captured more often by phenomenological models. Stouffer's own research on motifs in food webs offers an intriguing link between small and large food-web networks, and this question of scale is critical to future empirical research and attempts to manage natural resources and communities. This collection of papers aims to build on the exciting recent progress in food-web biology by integrating research in behavioural ecology, allometry, population ecology and community ecology. The authors explore the extent to which the structure and dynamics of populations and communities can be understood by including aspects of individual behaviour. The papers report on foraging decisions, cognitive ability and body size in models of and experiments at small and large scales, across a breadth of different systems, and by observational, experimental and theoretical approaches. The papers will hopefully acquaint ecologists with the current state of knowledge regarding scaling adaptive behaviour to community and ecosystem patterns and motivate the next decade of research linking behaviour to food webs.

https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.1969,Predicting coexistence in species with continuous ontogenetic niche shifts and competitive asymmetry,"A longstanding problem in ecology is whether structured life cycles impede or facilitate coexistence between species. Theory based on populations with only two discrete stages in the life-cycle indicates that for two species to coexist, at least one must shift its niche between stages and each species must be a better competitor in one of the niches. However, in many cases, niche shifts are associated with changes in an underlying continuous trait like body size and we have few predictions concerning conditions for coexistence for such a widespread form of ontogenetic development. We develop a framework for analyzing species coexistence based on Integral Projection Models (IPMs) that incorporates continuous ontogenetic changes in both the resource niche and competitive ability. We parameterize the model using experimental data from Trinidadian guppies and show how niche shifts and competitive symmetries impact species coexistence. Overall, our results show that the effects of competition on fitness depend upon trait-mediated niche-separation, trait-mediated competitive asymmetry in the part of the niche that is shared across body sizes, and the sensitivity of fitness to body size. Interactions among these processes generate multiple routes to coexistence. We discuss how our modeling framework expands results from two-stage models to mutli-stage or continuous stage models and allows for deriving predictions that can be tested in populations displaying continuous changes in niche use and competitive ability.",W2950098438,True,0.964063286781311

Recent evidence suggests that natural enemies could play an important role in the assembly of hyper-diverse tropical plant systems. Classic ecological theory predicts that in order for coexistence to occur, species differences must be maximized across biologically important niche dimensions. For plant-herbivore interactions, it has been recently suggested that, within a particular community, plant species that maximize the difference in chemical defense profiles compared to neighboring taxa will have a relative competitive advantage. Here we tested the hypothesis that plant chemical diversity can affect local community composition in the hyper-diverse genus Piper at a lowland wet forest location in Costa Rica. We first characterized the chemical composition of 27 of the most locally abundant species of Piper. We then tested whether species with different chemical compositions were more likely to coexist. Finally, we assessed the degree to which Piper phylogenetic relationships are related to differences in secondary chemical composition and community assembly. We found that, on average, co-occurring species were more likely to differ in chemical composition than expected by chance. Contrary to expectations, there was no phylogenetic signal for overall secondary chemical composition. In addition we found that species in local communities were, on average, more phylogenetically closely related than expected by chance, suggesting that functional traits other than those measured here also influence local assembly. We propose that selection by herbivores for divergent chemistries between closely related species facilitates the coexistence of a high diversity of congeneric taxa via apparent competition.",W2478088704,True,0.9969869256019592
https://doi.org/10.1890/06-1095.1,"TRITROPHIC EFFECTS OF BIRDS AND ANTS ON A CANOPY FOOD WEB, TREE GROWTH, AND PHYTOCHEMISTRY","Insectivorous birds and ants co-occur in most terrestrial communities, and theory predicts that emergent properties (i.e., nonadditive effects) can determine their combined influence on arthropods and plants. In a three-year factorial experiment, I investigated whether the effects of birds on pine and its arthropods differed based on the presence of ants that were predators of most arthropods, but mutualists with tended aphid species. Birds and ants reduced the abundance of most herbivorous and carnivorous arthropods in an additive fashion, with the effects of ants being stronger than those of birds. In sharp contrast, the opposing influences of birds and ants on tended aphid species interacted strongly; ants only increased tended aphid abundance in the absence of birds, while birds only reduced their abundance in the presence of ants. This interaction was mirrored in total herbivore abundance because tended aphids dominated the herbivore community. I develop a novel lexicon to discuss the emergent properties from these effects of opposing sign (predation, mutualism). Despite having emergent effects on herbivores, birds indirectly increased pine wood and foliage growth to a similar extent whether or not ants were present, while ants had no detectable effects. Birds also indirectly increased the abundance of some pine phloem monoterpenes, but these effects differed based on the presence or absence of ants. Thus, I report on a novel yet possibly widespread indirect interaction between intraguild predators, herbivore mutualists, and plant traits (growth, secondary chemistry) mediated through a species-rich community of arthropods.",W2146078060,True,0.9456583857536316

In Sonoran Desert annual plants, a trade‐off between relative growth rate (RGR) and water‐use efficiency (WUE) contributes to species differences in population dynamics that promote long‐term coexistence. Traits underlying this trade‐off explain variation in demographic responses to precipitation as well as life history and phenological patterns. Here, we ask how these traits mediate competitive interactions. • Methods: We conducted competition trials for three species occupying different positions along the RGR–WUE trade‐off axis and compared the effects of competition at high and low soil moisture. We compared competitive effect (ability to suppress neighbors) and competitive response (ability to withstand competition from neighbors) among species. • Key results: The RGR–WUE trade‐off predicted shifts in competitive responses at different soil moistures. The high‐RGR species was more resistant to competition in high water conditions, while the opposite was true for the high‐WUE species. The intermediate RGR species tended to have the strongest impact on all neighbors, so competitive effects did not scale directly with differences in RGR and WUE among competitors. • Conclusions: Our results reveal mechanisms underlying long‐term variation in fitness: high‐RGR species perform better in years with large, frequent rain events and can better withstand competition under wetter conditions. The opposite is true for high‐WUE species. Such resource‐dependent responses strongly influence community dynamics and can promote coexistence in variable environments.",W2065818477,True,0.9872058033943176

Here, we offer an alternative framework where virulent immune‐provoking behaviours and enhanced immune resistance are joint tactics of invading pathogens to eliminate resident competitors (transferring resources from resident to invading pathogen). The pathogen wins by creating a novel immunological challenge to which it is already adapted. We analyse a general ecological model of ‘proactive invasion’ where invaders not adapted to a local environment can succeed by changing it to one where they are better adapted than residents. However, the two‐trait nature of the ‘proactive’ strategy (provocation of, and adaptation to environmental change) presents an evolutionary conundrum, as neither trait alone is favoured in a homogenous host population. We show that this conundrum can be resolved by allowing for host heterogeneity. We relate our model to emerging empirical findings on immunological mediation of parasite competition.",W1998263965,True,0.9921417236328125
https://doi.org/10.1890/07-0659.1,GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION IN RESOURCE DOMINANCE–DISCOVERY IN BRAZILIAN ANT COMMUNITIES,"A predictive framework for the ecology of species invasions requires that we learn what limits successful invaders in their native range. The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) is invasive in the United States, Puerto Rico, Australia, New Zealand, and China. Solenopsis invicta appears to be a superior competitor in its introduced range, where it can cause the local extirpation of native species, but little is known about its competitive ability in its native range in South America. Here we examine the competitive ability of S. invicta for food resources in three widely separated Brazilian ant communities. Each of these communities contains 20-40 ant species, 8-10 of which were common and frequently interacted with S. invicta. S. invicta at all three sites was attacked by several species-specific phorid parasitoids, and at one site, two other species were attacked by their own specialized parasitoids. We examined interactions in these local communities for evidence that trade-offs among ant species between resource dominance and resource discovery, and between resource dominance and parasitoid vulnerability facilitate local coexistence. The trade-off between resource dominance and resource discovery was strong and significant only at Santa Genebra, where parasitoids had no effect on the outcome of confrontations at resources. At Bonito, parasitoids significantly reduced the ability of S. invicta, which was the top-ranked behavioral dominant, from defending and usurping food resources from subordinate species. In the Pantanal, S. invicta ranked behind three other ant species in a linear hierarchy of behavioral dominance, and lost the majority of its interactions with a fourth more subordinate species, Paratrechina fulva, another invasive species. Parasitoids of S. invicta were uncommon in the Pantanal, and did not affect its low position in the hierarchy relative to the other two sites. Parasitoids, however, did affect the ability of Linepithema angulatum, the top-ranked behavioral dominant in this community, from defending and usurping resources from behavioral subordinates. These results indicate that both interspecific competition and trait-mediated indirect effects of phorid parasitoids affect the ecological success of the red imported fire ant in its native range, but that the relative importance of these factors varies geographically.",W2106362457,True,0.9933352470397949

IGP communities composed of intraguild predators and prey have been well studied; however, we know less about IGP communities composed of predators, pathogens, and resources. Resource quality plays an important role in community dynamics and may influence IGP dynamics as well. We conducted a meta‐analysis on predator–pathogen–resource communities to determine whether resource quality mediated by the pathogen affected predator life‐history traits and if these effects met the theoretical constraints of IGP communities. To do this, we summarized results from studies that investigated the use of predators and pathogens to control insect pests. In these systems, the predators are the IG Pred and pathogens are the IG Prey. We found that consumer longevity, fecundity, and survival decreased by 26%, 31% and 13% respectively, when predators consumed pathogen‐infected prey, making the infected prey a low quality resource. Predators also significantly preferred healthy prey over infected prey. When we divided consumers by enemy type, strict predators (e.g. wolf spiders) had no preference while parasitoids preferred healthy prey. Our results suggest that communities containing parasitoids and pathogens may rarely exhibit intraguild predation; whereas, communities composed of strict predators and pathogens are more likely dominated by IGP dynamics. In these latter communities, the consumption of low and high quality resources suggests that IGP communities composed of strict predators, pathogens and prey should naturally persist, supporting IGP theory. Synthesis We investigated how consuming pathogen‐infected prey influence important life‐history parameters of insect predators. Pathogens are used in a variety of biocontrol programs, especially to control crop pests. We found that true predators (i.e. wolf spiders) have no preference for healthy or infected prey and have reduced fecundity, survival and longevity consuming infected prey. However, parasitoids avoided infected prey when possible. In biocontrol programs with multiple control agents, parasitoids and pathogens would do a better job controlling pests as predators would reduce the amount of pathogen available and have reduced fitness from consuming infected prey. However, theory suggests that true predators, prey and pathogens may coexist long term.",W2322152281,True,0.9749927520751953

Generally, divergence is assumed to occur when selection acts on the same, continuously varying trait in both species. However, selection might target multiple traits, and even closely related heterospecifics involved in character displacement might differ in selective targets. We investigated the targets of selection in a species of spadefoot toad, Spea multiplicata, during experimentally imposed competition with a congener, S. bombifrons. When examining traits separately, we found significant selection acting on multiple resource-acquisition traits. Yet, controlling for the independent effects of these traits in a multiple regression revealed that direct selection on a single trait might have contributed toward indirect selection on other correlated traits. Moreover, although we found evidence for plasticity in most traits, competition with S. bombifrons imposed selection on morphology and not on plasticity. Additional experiments suggest that the selective targets during character displacement might differ between the two species involved in this one instance of character displacement. Identifying the targets of competitively mediated selection is crucial, because whether and how character displacement ultimately unfolds depends on the nature of these targets and correlations among them.",W1882042664,True,0.9872004985809326

Crops are often colonised by aphids having different life‐history traits, and the aphids and their offspring compete for the shared resource. The intraspecific competition and dispersal characteristics of two strains (A and B) of the cotton aphid Aphis gossypii on cucumber were examined in a greenhouse study. Strain A normally feeds on cucumber, whereas strain B originated from melon but develops on cucumber. Both strains reproduce exclusively via parthenogenesis and can be discriminated using molecular markers. 2. The strains were released at the same time on different plants in a greenhouse. Total density and their dispersion within and between plants were recorded through time, and the frequency of each strain was assessed using DNA fingerprinting. The Lotka–Volterra competition model was used to test for inter‐strain competition and to estimate its intensity. 3. Strain A had the highest rate of increase and carrying capacity, and became the most frequent strain, nearly displacing strain B. Strain B was the most common only on the plants it infested first. The competition was unbalanced as strain B was affected strongly by strain A, but strain A was only affected minimally by strain B. This asymmetrical relationship for strain B was not due only to competition for the shared resource. 4. Such competition may in part explain the reduction of genetic polymorphism observed by others in the field where colonising strains coming from different hosts compete and some are eliminated. Polymorphism in A. gossypii populations in nature is thought to be maintained by heterogeneous patches of hosts differentially favourable for different clones.",W1962220962,True,0.9874318242073059
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13131,Cascading effects of a top predator on intraspecific competition at intermediate and basal trophic levels,"Abstract Predators can impact competition among prey by altering prey density via consumption or by causing prey to modify their traits or foraging behavior. Yet, differences between these two mechanisms may lead to different cascading impacts on lower trophic levels. Using a crab‐snail‐barnacle rocky intertidal food chain, we tested the effects of predation risk from crabs (top predators) on intraspecific competition among snails (intermediate consumers) and emergent indirect effects on the density of and competition among barnacles (basal resources). The per capita foraging and growth rates of snails declined with high conspecific density. Predation risk from crabs, which caused even larger reductions in snail foraging and growth, weakened competition among snails, whereas a 45% increase in barnacle density had no detectable effect on snail competition. Intraspecific competition between barnacles, however, depended on the interactive effects of barnacle density, snail density, and crab predation risk. Barnacles developed hummocking morphologies as they grew and competed for space. Hummock formation (a proxy for competition) increased as a result of either greater initial barnacle density or reduced snail foraging pressure, but these effects depended on predation risk. The effects of crab predation risk on snail foraging behavior weakened an otherwise strong relationship between barnacle density and hummock development: hummocking increased with barnacle density in the absence of crabs but remained relatively high when crabs were present. In communities with similar final barnacle densities, hummocking was more common in those with crabs than those without crabs. The extent to which predators can drive trophic cascades by suppressing the foraging rates of their prey is highly context‐dependent: the positive trait‐mediated indirect effect of predators on basal resource abundance is stronger when many prey respond simultaneously to the threat of predation. However, our results demonstrate that top predators can also enhance competition among basal resources even when their indirect effect on resource abundance is relatively weak. Hence, the cascading effects of predators on competition within lower trophic levels may play an important but under‐appreciated role in the dynamics of basal resource populations and the communities they support.

The net effects of bird predation on phytophagous insect populations (feeding on plants) are difficult to predict without comprehensively describing prey-predator communities and their complex interplay. We sampled bird and arthropod communities in 30 oilseed rape fields in the spring of 2019 and 2020 in France. To assess the top-down control of arthropods by birds, we used a vertebrate exclusion experiment. Using a taxonomic and functional trait-based approach, we determined the direct and indirect influences of birds on arthropod predators and phytophagous insect populations in arable crops. We observed a negative relationship between the abundance of Carabidae and phytophagous insects but not with the other predator group suggesting the key role of Carabidae on phytophagous insects in agroecosystem. We found no statistical evidence of intraguild predation from birds toward intermediate predators. Despite the lack of overall effect of predator functional diversity on their prey, we highlighted the negative relationship between the functional complementarity (through functional evenness) of Carabidae and the abundance of phytophagous insects. This result suggests that functional complementarity between Carabidae species could help to reduce phytophagous insect populations. We analyzed the effect of agricultural practices on these multitrophic interactions, showing that pesticide intensity only had detrimental effects on Carabidae abundance, while the frequency of tillage did not affect the studied communities.

While non‐consumptive predator effects have been mostly studied in three‐level food chains, we lack evidence for the propagation of non‐consumptive indirect effects of apex predators in four level food‐webs, notably in terrestrial ecosystems. In experimental mesocosms, we manipulated a four‐level food chain including top‐predator cues (snakes), mesopredators (lizards), herbivores (crickets), and primary producers (plants). The strength of the trophic cascade induced by mesopredators through the consumption of herbivores decreased in the presence of top‐predator cues. Specifically, primary production was higher in mesocosms where mesopredators were present relative to mesocosms with herbivores only, and this difference was reduced in presence of top‐predator cues, probably through a trait‐mediated effect on lizard foraging. Our study demonstrates that non‐consumptive effects of predation risk can cascade down to affect both herbivores and plants in a four‐level terrestrial food chain and emphasises the need to quantify the importance of such indirect effects in natural communities.",W2048307119,True,0.9905790686607361

For example, herbivore-induced responses in plants may make plants more resistant or susceptible to additional herbivorous insect species. Herbivore-induced plant responses can significantly affect interspecific competition and herbivore population dynamics. These herbivore–herbivore indirect interactions have been overlooked in aquatic ecosystems where previous studies used the same herbivore species to induce changes and to assess the effects of these changes. We asked whether seaweed grazing by one of two herbivorous, congeneric snail species (Littorina obtusata or Littorina littorea) with different feeding strategies and preferences would affect subsequent feeding preferences of three herbivore species (both snails and the isopod Idotea baltica) and population densities of three herbivore species (both snails and a third periwinkle snail, Lacuna vincta). In addition, we measured phlorotannin concentrations to test the hypothesis that these metabolites function as induced defenses in the Phaeophyceae. Snail herbivory induced cue-specific responses in apical tissues of the seaweed Fucus vesiculosus that affected the three herbivore species similarly. When compared to ungrazed controls, direct grazing by Littorina obtusata reduced seaweed palatability by at least 52% for both snail species and the isopod species. In contrast, direct grazing by L. littorea did not decrease seaweed palatability for any herbivore, indicating herbivore-specific responses. Previous grazing by L. obtusata reduced populations of L. littorea on outplanted seaweeds by 46% but had no effect on L. obtusata populations. Phlorotannins, a potential class of inducible chemicals in brown algae, were not more concentrated in grazed seaweed tissues, suggesting that some other trait was responsible for the induced resistance. Our results indicate that marine herbivores may compete via inducible responses in shared seaweeds. These plant-mediated interactions were asymmetric with a specialist (L. obtusata) competitively superior to a generalist (L. littorea).",W2123475715,True,0.9959239363670349

Periphyton biomass response to inorganic nutrient enrichment varied by fish type. Invertebrate densities on artificial substrates were higher in the Galaxias streams, with the exception of chironomids. Nutrient enrichment of periphyton led to increases in total invertebrate densities, but these increases were greater in the Galaxias streams where invertebrate predation was thought to be lower.

Two different evolutionary responses that remove a disadvantageous heterozygote phenotype from the population are the evolution of strictly assortative mate choice, and that of a modifier making one of the two alleles completely dominant. We derive invasion fitness of mutants introducing dominance or assortative mate choice in a randomly mating population with a genetic polymorphism for an ecological trait. Mutations with small effects as well as mutants introducing complete dominance or perfect assorting are considered. Using adaptive dynamics techniques, we are able to calculate the ratio of fitness gradients for the effects of a dominance modifier and a mate choice locus, near evolutionary branching points. With equal resident allele frequencies, selection for mate choice is always stronger. Dominance is more strongly selected than assortative mating when the resident (common) alleles have very unequal frequencies at equilibrium. With female mate choice the difference in frequencies where dominance is more strongly selected is smaller than when mutants of both sexes can choose without costs.

Instead, there was evidence that the extent of resource polymorphism may be largely caused by phenotypic plasticity. These results suggest that assortative mating, which can lead to genetically determined adaptive divergence, does occur in these species, particularly perch, but not according to genetically fixed morphological traits.

Bruno (2009) Predator richness has no effect in a diverse marine food web. Journal of Animal Ecology, 78, 732–740. Disentangling the effects of predator loss can be complex as predators exert a suite of direct and indirect effects in ecosystems. O’Connor & Bruno manipulated predator abundance, richness, and composition in experiments with and without prey dispersal in an estuarine ecosystem. They observed effects of predator presence and composition on prey assemblages, particularly in experiments without prey dispersal, but they found no effect of predator richness on prey assemblage. Here, we discuss the role of non-additive, antagonistic, and spatial effects of predators in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning experiments, with a particular focus on the results of O’Connor & Bruno. Predators are disproportionately threatened by human activities relative to other trophic groups (Pauly et al. 1998; Duffy 2003) and predator extinctions can have cascading effects in ecosystems (e.g. Terborgh et al. 2001; Duffy 2003). The strength of these effects varies among ecosystems (Shurin et al. 2002) and depends on the assemblage of predators present (Bruno & Cardinale 2008). Given current rates of biodiversity loss, there is a sense of urgency to develop a better understanding of the functional consequences of biodiversity loss in different ecosystems. Most biodiversity and ecosystem functioning studies, however, focus on sessile organisms because mobile organisms, like predators, are much more difficult to control, like herbaceaus plants (Duffy et al. 2007). Studies that investigate the effects of predators in ecosystems usually focus on the direct effects of a single predator species on prey and the subsequent indirect or cascading effects on producers (Hairston, Smith, & Slobodkin 1960; Oksanen et al. 1981; Carpenter, Kitchell, & Hodgson 1985). A growing number of studies are now investigating the effects of predator richness in ecosystems (reviewed in Duffy et al. 2007), but these studies are often limited to small spatial scales and few species. Natural ecosystems are complex (Polis & Strong 1996) and presently, we have resolved the complete web of trophic interactions in only a few cases. Consequently, we currently lack a synthetic understanding of the multiple effects of predators in ecosystems (Fig. 1). In this issue of the Journal of Animal Ecology, O’Connor & Bruno (2009) designed field and mesocosm experiments to disentangle the effects of predator abundance, diversity, and composition on diverse prey assemblages in a subtidal estuarine food web in Bogue Sound, North Carolina, USA. Conceptual diagram of the multiple effects of predators in ecosystems. Consumptive effects are represented with solid lines, nonconsumptive effects are represented with dashed lines, and spatial effects are represented with dotted lines. 1, Direct consumption; 2, trait-mediated, nonlethal interactions; 3, omnivory; 4, trophic cascades; 5, nutrient recycling; 6, intraspecific interference; 7, intraguild predation; 8, competition; and 9, spatial subsidies. O’Connor & Bruno (2009) measured direct consumption (1) and partially controlled for intraguild predation (7). O’Connor & Bruno's (2009) study system is ideal for experimental manipulation because it harbours a diverse predator assemblage (10 species) and a high diversity of amphipod, isopod, and gastropod prey species (52), which have rapid demographic responses to changes in predation and habitat quality. O’Connor & Bruno (2009) designed two field experiments where prey species were able to disperse and one mesocosm experiment that was closed to prey dispersal. Their study is one of the few experiments to vary prey dispersal and predator diversity and composition simultaneously, although they did not control prey dispersal. Predator presence reduced prey density by at least half and reduced prey richness by one to six species but both effects depended on the predator species present. Overall, shrimp presence had the strongest effects on prey density and richness. In two of the experiments predator presence also significantly shifted prey composition. For example, in the presence of shrimp the relative abundance of the amphipod, Elasmopus levis, more than doubled whereas the relative abundance of the isopod, Paracerceis caudata, decreased by threefold. These effects were strongest in the mesocosm experiment, where prey dispersal did not occur. This suggests that prey dispersal may dampen the effects of multiple predators on prey, although these results are confounded by the fact that prey diversity was also lowest in the mesocosm experiment. O’Connor & Bruno (2009) did not find a significant effect of predator richness on prey density, richness, or composition. Here we explore two potential reasons why O’Connor & Bruno (2009) did not observe an effect of predator richness on prey assemblages: (i) non-additive, antagonistic interactions between predators, and (ii) spatial effects. Sih, Englund, & Wooster (1998) defined three categories of multiple-predator effects: linear (i.e. substitutable and additive), risk enhancing (i.e. synergistic) or risk reducing (i.e. antagonistic). Non-additive, antagonistic interactions between predators are frequent (Finke & Denno 2005; Schmitz 2007; Bruno & Cardinale 2008), and theory demonstrates that these interactions can decrease the per capita capture rates of predator species and dampen the effects of multiple predators on prey assemblages (Ives, Cardinale, & Snyder 2005; Casula, Wilby & Thomas 2006). Interference, intraguild predation, and nonlethal interactions are common non-additive, antagonistic interactions (Schmitz 2007). For example, Finke & Denno (2005) observed that intraguild predation dampened the effects of predators (i.e. spiders, beetles) on herbivores (i.e. planthoppers) and producers (i.e. cordgrass) in a salt-marsh mesocosm study. O’Connor & Bruno (2009) held predator density constant in all their experiments and to limit the effects of intraguild predation, they checked each enclosure at least twice during the experiments and replaced missing predators. They were able to estimate the potential magnitude of density-mediated intraguild predation but they were not able to quantify the trait-mediated, nonlethal effects of intraguild predators in experimental cages. Shrimps were the most common victim of intraguild predation but they also had the strongest, negative effects on prey density relative to other predators in monoculture and they significantly reduced prey richness, evenness, and composition as described above. As a result, intraguild predation on shrimps may have played the same role as an additional trophic level controlling the most efficient consumers in this system, i.e., it generated a negative selection effect that opposed any complementarity effect among predators (Loreau & Hector 2001; Thébault & Loreau 2003). Furthermore, predators can have both density- and trait-mediated effects on prey species (e.g. Schmitz 2003); therefore, we should expect that the presence of an intraguild predator may also have the potential to cause trait-mediated indirect effects on the predators they consume. The presence of nonlethal interactions between predators in the O’Connor & Bruno (2009) experiments, however, may have been limited because prey did not have access to refuge area. Conversely, the potential for intraguild predation to dampen the effects of predator richness on prey assemblages appears to be strong in this ecosystem. The flow of energy, material, and organisms across ecosystems, most commonly referred to as allochthonous inputs or spatial subsidies, is ubiquitous (Polis, Anderson & Holt 1997; Loreau, Mouquet & Holt 2003). Theory and experiments that incorporate spatial flows can be complex but offer new insights into the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. For example, McCann, Rasmussen, & Umbanhowar (2005) provided empirical data and theoretical analysis to demonstrate that mobile predators can couple distinct patches and stabilize complex ecosystems. Similarly, Nakano & Murakami (2001) demonstrated a strong reliance of aquatic (i.e. fish) and terrestrial (i.e. birds) consumers on subsidies during different times of the year. O’Connor & Bruno (2009) found limited differences between the experiments that allowed prey dispersal and the one that did not. In the field experiments, prey were able to disperse to and from the regional species pool; therefore, we would expect dampened effects of caged predators because of quick replacement of lost prey within the inclusion cages. A thorough understanding of who eats whom, who affects whom in other ways, and the dispersal abilities of different species is critical to predicting the effects of diversity in natural ecosystems, particularly for the top of the food chain where indirect effects are common (Fig. 1). O’Connor & Bruno (2009) is part of a group of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning studies that have manipulated predator diversity. Results from these studies demonstrate that multiple predators may have null, additive, antagonistic, or synergistic effects on prey assemblages (Cardinale et al. 2006; Duffy et al. 2007; Bruno & Cardinale 2008). The habitat domain of predator and prey (i.e. spatial movement) and hunting mode of the predator interact to shape the outcome of multiple-predator effects in ecosystems (Schmitz 2007). O’Connor & Bruno's (2009) experiments are limited because they artificially reduced the habitat domain of the predators by preventing predator dispersal. Experiments with spatially constrained designs, such as small enclosures, may facilitate antagonistic effects between predators because predators in constrained habitats may hunt each other (Schmitz 2007). Predator dispersal may create spatial heterogeneity in predator–prey dynamics because predators will be able to actively select areas with preferred food and abandon areas with undesirable food (France & Duffy 2006). This will also enable intraguild prey to find spatial refuges. Densities of prey in these refuge areas may decrease as a result of increased predation pressure (e.g. Schmitz 2003). Natural ecosystems are open to spatial flows at all trophic levels, therefore, future experiments should explicitly test for the effects of predator mobility on prey assemblages. To incorporate predator mobility effectively, the spatial extent of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning experiments will likely have to increase to accommodate the larger foraging spectrum of most predators. Diverse predator assemblages are becoming increasingly rare both on land and at sea. Biodiversity loss at the top of food chains can have strong cascading effects but we still have a rudimentary understanding of these effects in diverse, spatially extended ecosystems. Future studies on the effects of predator diversity in ecosystems should simultaneously consider non-additive and nontrophic interactions and spatial effects of predators in addition to their direct trophic effects through local prey consumption. Schmitz (2007) provides a theoretical framework for incorporating multiple-predator effects in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning experiments. A more thorough understanding of the multiple effects of predator in ecosystems is required to inform conservation and management of biodiversity in our rapidly changing world. We thank C.

https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13785,Eco‐evolutionary feedbacks between prey densities and linkage disequilibrium in the predator maintain diversity,"Diversity occurs at multiple scales. Within a single population, there is diversity in genotypes and phenotypes. At a larger scale, within ecological communities, there is diversity in species. A number of studies have investigated how diversity at these two scales influence each other through what has been termed eco‐evolutionary feedbacks. Here we study a three‐species ecological module called apparent competition, in which the predator is evolving in a trait that determines its interaction with two prey species. Unlike previous studies on apparent competition, which employed evolutionary frameworks with very simple genetics, we study an eco‐evolutionary model in which the predator's trait is determined by two recombining diallelic loci, so that its mean and variance can evolve, as well as associations (linkage disequilibrium) between the loci. We ask how eco‐evolutionary feedbacks with these two loci affect the coexistence of the prey species and the maintenance of polymorphisms within the predator species. We uncover a novel eco‐evolutionary feedback between the prey densities and the linkage disequilibrium between the predator's loci. Through a stability analysis, we demonstrate how these feedbacks affect polymorphisms at both loci and, among others, may generate stable cycling.",W2950984107,True,0.9952742457389832

When IAS and their parasite(s) invade a guild, the effects of interspecific resource competition and/or parasite‐mediated competition can alter existing native host–parasite relationships and the dependent biological traits such as native species' behaviour. We used a natural experiment of populations of native red squirrels Sciurus vulgaris that were colonized by the alien grey squirrel Sciurus carolinensis, comparing repeated measurements of red squirrel parasite infection and personality with those taken in sites where only the native species occurred. We explored two alternative hypotheses: (a) individual differences in personality traits (activity and/or sociability) of native red squirrel positively affect the probability of macroparasite spillover and thus the likelihood to acquire the alien's parasitic helminth Strongyloides robustus ; (b) the combined effects of grey squirrel presence and parasite infection result in a reduction of costly personality traits (activity and/or exploration). Using data from 323 arena tests across three experimental (native species and IAS) and three control sites (only native species), we found negative correlations between native species' activity and infection with S. robustus in the sites invaded by the alien species. Activity was also negatively correlated with infection by its native helminth Trypanoxyuris sciuri but only when grey squirrels were present, while in the red‐only sites there was no relationship of T. sciuri infection with any of the personality traits. Moreover, individuals that acquired S. robustus during the study reduced their activity after infection, while this was not the case for animals that remained uninfected. Our results show that parasite‐mediated competition is costly, reducing activity in individuals of the native species, and altering the native host–native parasite relationships.",W3016233474,True,0.9797359108924866

We studied the interactions among the herb Ruellia nudiflora, a seed predator, and its parasitoids using 14 maternal plant families grown in a common garden. By fertilizing half of the plants of each family and subsequently recording fruit number, seed predator number, and parasitoid number per plant, we sought to compare the strength of plant genetic effects with those of soil fertility, and determine if these factors interactively shape tri‐trophic interactions. Furthermore, we evaluated if these bottom–up factors influenced higher trophic levels through changes in abundance across trophic levels (density‐mediated) or changes in the function of species interactions (trait‐mediated). Plant genetic effects on seed predators and parasitoids were stronger than fertilization effects. Moreover, we did not find plant genetic variation for fertilization effects on fruit, seed predator, or parasitoid abundance, showing that each factor acted independently on plant resources and higher trophic levels. Both bottom–up forces were transmitted via density‐mediated effects where increased fruit number from fertilization and plant genetic effects increased seed predator and parasitoid abundance; however, seed predator attack was density‐dependent, while parasitoid attack was density‐independent. Importantly, there was evidence (marginally significant in one case) that fertilization modified the function of plant‐seed predator and seed predator–parasitoid interactions by increasing the number of seed predators per fruit and decreasing the number of parasitoids per seed predator, respectively. These findings show that plant genetic and soil fertility effects cascaded up this simple food chain, that plant genetic effects were stronger across all trophic levels, and that these effects were transmitted independently and through contrasting mechanisms.",W2124078035,True,0.9419194459915161
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12165,Cascading effects of predator–detritivore interactions depend on environmental context in a <scp>T</scp>ibetan alpine meadow,"Summary Studies of grazing food webs show that species traits can interact with environmental factors to determine the strength of trophic cascades, but analogous context dependencies in detrital food webs remain poorly understood. In predator–detritivore–plant interaction chains, predators are expected to indirectly suppress plant biomass by reducing the density of plant‐facilitating detritivores. However, this outcome can be reversed where above‐ground predators drive burrowing detritivores to lower soil levels, strengthening their plant‐facilitating effects. Here, we show that these trait‐mediated indirect interactions further depend on environmental context in a T ibetan alpine meadow. In our study system, undulating topography generates higher (dry soil) patches interspersed with lower (wet soil) patches. Because the ability of detritivores to form deep burrows is likely to be limited by oxygen availability in low patches (wet soil), we hypothesized that (i) burrowing detritivores would undergo a vertical habitat shift, allowing them to more effectively avoid predation, in high – but not low – patches, and (ii) this shift would transmit positive effects of predators to plants in high patches by improving conditions in the lower soil layer. We tested these hypotheses using complementary field and glasshouse experiments examining whether the cascading effects of above‐ground predatory beetles (presence/absence) on the density and behaviour of tunnel‐forming detritivorous beetles, soil properties, and plant growth varied with patch type (low/high). Results revealed that predatory beetles did not reduce the density of detritivores in either patch type but had context‐dependent trait‐mediated effects, increasing the tunnelling depth of detritivores, improving soil conditions and ultimately increasing plant biomass in the high but not low patches. This study adds to an emerging predictive framework linking predators to plants in detritus food webs, demonstrating that these indirect interactions depend not just on the relative habitat domains of predators and prey, but also on environmental conditions that can predictably constrain the behavioural response of detritivores to predation risk.",W1979268075,True,0.9727651476860046
https://doi.org/10.1111/1749-4877.12543,Palatability and profitability of co‐occurring seeds alter indirect interactions among rodent‐dispersed trees,"Beyond direct species interactions, seed dispersal is potentially affected by indirect seed-seed interactions among co-occurring nut-bearing trees which are mediated by scatter-hoarding animals as shared seed dispersers. A relevant question in such systems is to what extent different functional traits related to food palatability and profitability affect the kinds of indirect interactions that occur among co-occurring seeds, and the consequences for seed dispersal. We used field experiments to track seed dispersal with individually tagged seeds in both monospecific and mixed seed communities. We measured indirect effects based on 3 seed-seed species pairs from the family Fagaceae with contrasting seed size, tannin level, and dormancy in a subtropical forest in Southwest China. When all else was equal, the presence of adjacently placed seeds with contrasting seed traits created different indirect effects measured through a variety of dispersal-related indicators. Apparent mutualism was reciprocal due to increasing seed dispersal in mixed seed patches with mixed differences in seed tannins and dormancy. However, differences in either seed size or dormancy in co-occurring adjacently placed seeds caused apparent competition with reduced seed removal or seed dispersal (distance) in at least one species. Our study supports the hypothesis that different functional traits related to food palatability and profitability in co-occurring seeds modify foraging decisions of scatter-hoarding animals, and subsequently cause indirect effects on seed dispersal among rodent-dispersed trees. We conclude that such indirect effects mediated by shared seed dispersers may act as an important determinant of seed dispersal for co-fruiting animal-dispersed trees in many natural forests.",W3156834625,True,0.9906169772148132

In this study, we coupled field observations with experiments to ask if the degree of character displacement reflects the intensity of competition between two closely related spadefoot toads (Spea bombifrons and S. multiplicata). Tadpoles of both species develop into either a small-headed omnivorous morph, which feeds mostly on detritus, or a large-headed carnivorous morph, which specializes on and whose phenotype is induced by fairy shrimp. Previously, we found that S. multiplicata are inferior competitors for fairy shrimp and are less likely to develop into carnivores in sympatry with S. bombifrons. We compared four key trophic characters in S. multiplicata across natural ponds where the frequency of S. bombifrons varied. We found that S. multiplicata became increasingly more omnivore-like as the relative abundance of S. bombifrons increased. Moreover, in controlled laboratory populations, S. multiplicata became increasingly more omnivore-like and S. bombifrons became increasingly more carnivore-like as we increased the relative abundance of the other species. Phenotypic plasticity helped mediate this divergence: S. multiplicata became increasingly less likely to eat shrimp and develop into carnivores in the presence of S. bombifrons, a superior predator on shrimp. However, divergence also reflected differences in canalized traits: When reared under common conditions, S. multiplicata tadpoles became increasingly less likely to produce carnivores as their natal pond decreased in elevation. Presumably, this pattern reflected selection against carnivores in lower-elevation ponds, because S. bombifrons became increasingly more common with decreasing elevation. Local genetic adaptation to the presence of S. bombifrons was remarkably fine grained, with differences in carnivore production detected between populations a few kilometers apart. Our results suggest that the degree of character displacement potentially reflects the intensity of competition between interacting species and that both phenotypic plasticity and fine-scale genetic differentiation can mediate this response. Moreover, these results provide causal evidence linking resource competition to species divergence.",W4231502602,True,0.9916436076164246

The outcomes of herbivore‐mediated indirect effects are primarily dependent on the environment and have complex interactions with the direct interactions between plants. We evaluated the herbivore‐mediated indirect effects of Solidago altissima (Asteraceae) on other co‐occurring native Asteraceae species at multiple sites in a native range [the United States (US)] and in an introduced range (Japan) using common garden experiments. We examined the effect of S. altissima on herbivore damage, above‐ground vegetative and reproductive traits of the co‐occurring Asteraceae species at sites with different densities of a herbivore, the lace bug, Corythucha marmorata, which is native to the US and introduced in Japan. We observed increased lace bug herbivory in plants grown with S. altissima in Japan but decreased lace bug herbivory in the US. We did not find consistent effect of S. altissima on aboveground vegetative production of co‐occurring plants in either ranges. Flower production decreased in plants grown with S. altissima in Japan because of both direct competition and increased herbivory. Direct competition and apparent competition via lace bug herbivory interacted to produce a strong negative effect of S. altissima on co‐occurring plants only in Japan. Synthesis. The findings imply that evolutionary history and the local environment jointly affect herbivore‐mediated indirect effects, which play a large role in shaping the pattern of herbivory and plant competition. Another implication of our results is that exotic herbivores may reinforce the negative effects of exotic plants on native plants under high herbivore density environments.",W3167438190,True,0.9416058659553528
https://doi.org/10.1890/09-0979.1,Dietary flexibility aids Asian earthworm invasion in North American forests,"On a local scale, invasiveness of introduced species and invasibility of habitats together determine invasion success. A key issue in invasion ecology has been how to quantify the contribution of species invasiveness and habitat invasibility separately. Conventional approaches, such as comparing the differences in traits and/or impacts of species between native and/or invaded ranges, do not determine the extent to which the performance of invaders is due to either the effects of species traits or habitat characteristics. Here we explore the interaction between two of the most widespread earthworm invaders in the world (Asian Amynthas agrestis and European Lumbricus rubellus ) and study the effects of species invasiveness and habitat invasibility separately through an alternative approach of “third habitat” in Tennessee, USA. We propose that feeding behaviors of earthworms will be critical to invasion success because trophic ecology of invasive animals plays a key role in the invasion process. We found that (1) the biomass and isotopic abundances (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) of A. agrestis were not impacted by either direct effects of L. rubellus competition or indirect effects of L. rubellus ‐preconditioned habitat; (2) A. agrestis disrupted the relationship between L. rubellus and soil microorganisms and consequently hindered litter consumption by L. rubellus ; and (3) compared to L. rubellus, A. agrestis shifted its diet more readily to consume more litter, more soil gram‐positive (G+) bacteria (which may be important for litter digestion), and more non‐microbial soil fauna when soil microorganisms were depleted. In conclusion, A. agrestis showed strong invasiveness through its dietary flexibility through diet shifting and superior feeding behavior and its indirectly negative effect of habitat invasibility on L. rubellus via changes in the soil microorganism community. In such context, our results expand on the resource fluctuation hypothesis and support the superior competitor hypothesis.

Among the most striking examples are resource polymorphisms, where alternative morphs that utilize different resources evolve within a population. An underappreciated aspect of their evolution is that the same conditions that favor resource polymorphism-competition and ecological opportunity-might foster additional rounds of diversification within already existing morphs. We examined these issues in spadefoot toad tadpoles that develop into either a generalist ""omnivore"" or a specialist ""carnivore"" morph. Specifically, we assessed the morphological diversity of tadpoles from natural ponds and experimentally induced carnivores reared on alternative diets. We also surveyed natural ponds to determine if the strength of intramorph competition and the diversity and abundance of dietary resources (measures of ecological opportunity) influenced the diversity of within-morph variation. We found that five omnivore and four carnivore types were present in natural ponds; alternative diets led to shape differences, some of which mirrored variation in the wild; and both competition and ecological opportunity were associated with enhanced morphological diversity in natural ponds. Such fine-scale intraspecific variation might represent an underappreciated form of biodiversity and might constitute a crucible of evolutionary innovation and diversification.",W2750206028,True,0.9407746195793152

In this paper, we build a differential equation model by adding four parameters to study the influence of multiple competitive relationships on the predatorprey system, It includes the enhancement effect g of intraspecific competition and the enhancement effect h of interspecific competition between susceptible population and infected population, the weakening effect m of intraspecific competition and the weakening effect n of interspecific competition between susceptible population and infected population. Through the analysis, it can be concluded that a single g or m can promote the symbiosis of predator and prey, a single h has little effect on the population dynamics, and a single n is not conducive to the symbiosis; The fusion of g and h promotes coexistence, but the fusion of m and n is on the contrary; Interestingly, the combination of multiple regulatory parameters has a chemical effect on the survival of species, but the combination of g, m and h can inhibit coexistence, while the combination of g, m and n can promote coexistence. The reason is that the combination of parameters is not a simple addition of effects, but a prerequisite for mutual influence.

Higher-order ecological effects beyond pairwise interactions may be key to complex ecosystems, but mechanisms to produce these effects remain poorly understood. Here we model microbial growth and competition to show that higher-order effects can arise from variation in multiple microbial growth traits, such as lag times and growth rates, on a single limiting resource with no other interactions. These effects produce a range of ecological phenomena: an unlimited number of strains can exhibit multistability and neutral coexistence, potentially with a single keystone strain; strains that coexist in pairs do not coexist all together; and a strain that wins all pairwise competitions can go extinct in a mixed competition. Since variation in multiple growth traits is ubiquitous in microbial populations, our results indicate these higher-order effects may also be widespread, especially in laboratory ecology and evolution experiments.",W3100236633,True,0.934320867061615

Per‐capita resource availability in aquatic habitats is influenced directly by consumer density via resource competition and indirectly via delayed resource competition when temporally non‐overlapping cohorts of larvae exploit the same resources. In detritus‐based systems, resources are likely to be influenced by the age of the aquatic habitat, as detritus changes in quality over time and may be replenished by new inputs. 2. For aquatic insects that exploit detritus‐based habitats, feeding conditions experienced during immature stages can influence fitness directly via effects on development and survivorship, but also indirectly by influencing adult traits such as fecundity and longevity. 3. Larval habitat age and prior resource exploitation were manipulated in a field experiment using the container mosquito Aedes triseriatus. 4. It was found that A. triseriatus from older habitats had greater larval survival, faster development and greater adult longevity. Exploitation of larval habitats by a prior cohort of larvae had a significant negative effect on subsequent cohorts of larvae by delaying development. 5. It is suggested that extended conditioning of detritus probably resulted in conversion of recalcitrant resources to more available forms which improved the quality of the habitat. 6. In a parallel study, evidence was found of carry‐over effects of habitat age and prior exploitation on adult longevity for A. triseriatus and Aedes japonicus collected from unmanipulated aquatic habitats. 7.

https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.06651,Pollinator competition and the structure of floral resources,"The mutualism between plants and pollinators is built upon the trophic ecology of flowers and florivores. Yet the ecology of flowers‐as‐food is left implicit in most studies of plant–pollinator ecology, and it has been largely neglected in mainstream trophic ecology. This deficit is especially evident in an emerging issue of basic and applied significance: competition between pollinators for floral resources. In this synthesis, we start by exploring the notion of floral resource limitation upon which most studies concerning competition between pollinators are tacitly predicated. Both theoretical and empirical lines of evidence indicate that floral resource limitation must be understood as a complex ecological contingency; the question is not simply whether but when, where and in what regions of floral trait space resources are limiting. Based on this premise, we propose a framework for understanding floral resource availability in terms of temporal, spatial and functional structure. While this framework is conceptually intuitive, it is empirically and analytically demanding. We review existing methods for measuring and summarizing the multi‐dimensional structure of floral resources, highlight their strengths and weaknesses, and identify opportunities for future methods development. We then discuss the causal relationships linking floral resource structure to species coexistence, plant–pollinator community dynamics, and exogenous drivers like climate, land use, and episodic disturbances. In its role as both cause and effect, floral resource structure mediates the relationship between behavioral ecology, landscape ecology, and coexistence theory with respect to flowers and florivores. Establishing floral resource structure as an object of study and application will both shed light on basic questions of coexistence and guide management decisions concerning contentious issues such as the compatibility of apiculture with wild pollinator conservation and the appropriate use of floral enhancements in agri‐environment schemes.",W4383816818,True,0.9601467251777649
https://doi.org/10.1086/bblv223n2p167,Community Ecology and the Evolution of Molecules of Keystone Significance,"Molecules of keystone significance are vital in structuring ecological communities. Select bioactive compounds can cause disproportionately large effects by connecting such seemingly disparate processes as microbial loop dynamics and apex predation. Here, we develop a general theory and propose mechanisms that could lead to the evolution of keystone molecules. Introduced into a respective community by one, or only a few, autotrophic or microbial species, these compounds often originate as chemical defenses. When co-opted by resistant consumer species, however, they are used either in chemical defense against higher-order predators or as chemosensory cues that elicit courtship and mating, alarm, and predatory search. Requisite to these multifunctional properties, biosynthetic capacity evolves along with mechanisms for resistance and/or toxin storage in primary producers. Subsequently, consumers acquire resistances or tolerances, and the toxins are transferred through food webs via trophic interactions. In consumers, mechanisms eventually evolve for recognizing toxins as feeding cues and, ultimately, as signals or pheromones in chemical communication within or between species. One, or a few, active compounds can thus mediate a vast array of physiological traits, expressed differentially across many species in a given community. Through convergent evolution, molecules of keystone significance provide critical information to phylogenetically diverse species, initiate major trophic cascades, and structure communities within terrestrial, freshwater, coastal-ocean and open-ocean habitats.",W2105523233,True,0.9906305074691772
https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.2001.00048.x,Aardvarck to <i>Zyzyxia</i>– functional groups across kingdoms,"Though the desire to group species according to their ecological role is not a new one (Theophrastus classified plants into trees, shrubs and herbs in about 300 bc), the concept of the functional group has received renewed attention in relation to research on the effects of global change on terrestrial ecosystems (Smith et al., 1997) and on relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function (Körner, 1993; Wardle et al., 1999). A large amount of activity and numerous publications have resulted, mostly in the area of plant functional types (Woodward & Cramer, 1996; Lavorel & Cramer, 1999), but also for other organisms including soil biota (Lavelle, 1997; Mikola & Setälä, 1998), vertebrates (Simberloff & Dayan, 1991), and aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates (Covich et al., 1999). The objective of the symposium 'Functional Groups: concepts and applications' was to build bridges, finding common concepts and approaches between those working in these hitherto ill-connected areas of investigation. Though the variety of views on functional groupings for different organisms and ecosystems cannot be ignored, scientists in the different disciplines are faced with common motivations, approaches and difficulties. Participants identified some common principles and conceptual or methodological problems. The first striking and sobering issue is that of concepts and definitions. In spite of continued efforts by proponents of the functional group approach to publish in widely read journals (Simberloff & Dayan, 1991; Lavelle, 1997; Lavorel et al., 1997) terms continue to be used with little consistency. A frequent confusion concerns functional groups in their stricter definition (groups of species with a similar role or effect for ecosystem functioning) and response groups (groups of species with a similar response to an ecological factor). The two types of functional classifications also correspond with different approaches and lists of traits measured. Detailed physiological studies at the individual level (e.g. T.S. Barigah and co-workers, INRA Nancy, France; C. Descolas-Gros, Université Montpellier II, France) are more commonly used for functional groups, whereas response groups are identified through community-level studies of response to a diversity of abiotic, disturbance and biotic factors (e.g. G. Bornette, Laboratoire d'Ecologie des Hydrosystèmes Fluviaux, Villeurbanne, France; T. Dutoit, Université d'Aix-Marseille, France; S. Jauffret, CEFE-CNRS, Montpellier, France). The use of often nonoverlapping traits between the two types of studies makes it difficult to reconcile the two types of classifications. Across fields, 'complete' functional classifications that are relevant to ecosystem dynamics and functioning would need to include aspects of the following: Demography (life history characteristics and adaptive strategies) Feeding strategy (i.e. interspecific interactions) Effects on ecosystem function through biogeochemical cycles or changes in ecosystem structure. One striking difference that appeared between disciplines concerns the basis on which species are grouped. In plants, virtually all classifications are based on the use of traits, while in animals (vertebrates, soil macro-fauna and aquatic organisms), species tend to be grouped in relation to their action in the ecosystem (Bouché, 1977) For animals, and especially vertebrates (J. Blondel, CEFE-CNRS, Montpellier, France), the notion of guilds has long pervaded thoughts on community structure (Diamond, 1975). Guilds are defined as groups of species that exploit the same class of environmental resources in a similar way (Root, 1967). They do so using a diversity of strategies, such as differentiation in beak size in birds. Guilds have also recently been applied to plants (Wilson, 1999) to examine the structure of communities from the point of view of groups with strong intragroup, but weak intergroup, competition. Although the notion of guilds does have common points with the idea of functional classification, the former emphasizes community structure as opposed to ecosystem dynamics and functioning in the latter. Working from the point of view of guilds and trophic networks, classifications of soil fauna and aquatic invertebrates have traditionally focused on the role played by species in trophic relationships. However, recent work has demonstrated the need to consider other functions, such as mechanical effects of organisms on ecosystems (bioturbation and ecosystem engineering at large) in addition to effects on biogeochemical cycles through trophic relationships (P. Lavelle, Ecologie des Sols Tropicaux – IRD Bondy, France for the soil macro-fauna; M. Gérino, CESAC-CNRS, Toulouse, France and G. Stora, Centre d'Océanologie de Marseille, Marseille, France for aquatic invertebrates). In plants, research on functional types has examined a very large number of responses and functions. However, from the trophic perspective adopted for animals, one could argue that plants should belong to a single functional group. From a whole ecosystem perspective, plants are indeed a single group whose main function is the production of organic matter from the (mostly) inorganic resources of the environment. This perspective, however, ignores other trophic interactions such as those involved in selective herbivory of different organs or animal-mediated dispersal. Following this perspective, interspecific differences concern the intensity at which the autotrophic function is performed, as the result of a fundamental trade-off between traits favouring resource acquisition and those relevant to resource conservation (Grime et al., 1997; Poorter & Garnier, 1999). The intensity can also be regulated by response to other environmental constraints such as disturbances or biotic interactions. The difficulty in relating this intensity with responses to diverse and simultaneous environmental factors then stems from the frequent lack of overlap between classifications developed for different factors. In plants, a wealth of studies about response to disturbance, resource gradients and competition highlight the importance of a few central traits which appear relevant to both response and function (H. Gondard, CEFE-CNRS, Montpellier, France; T. Dutoit, Université d'Aix-Marseille, France). These include Raunkiaer's (1934) life forms or life-form schemes based on a similar philosophy (Box, 1981). The three traits included in Westoby's (1998) plant ecology strategy scheme (seed size, plant height and specific leaf area) have also been repeatedly identified as related to plant functioning in different environmental conditions, response to disturbance and biotic interactions (Garnier et al., CEFE-CNRS, Montpellier, France). Interestingly, body size also plays a key role in the ecology of animals (Peters, 1983; West et al., 1997). More specifically, the body area : volume ratio – an index that may be compared to the specific leaf area for plants – has been related to metabolic rates in particular. Future challenges lie in linking response groups with functional effects, especially through the use of appropriate (rather than ad hoc) trait lists. For soil invertebrates, existing classifications still rely heavily on taxonomy, since many of them concern only one particular taxonomic group (e.g. earthworms, nematodes and collembola). This should be reconsidered, because aspects of soil functioning, such as modifications of soil structure, depend on a variety of organisms that may not be taxonomically close. For plants, the way forward is to use a common list of key traits obtained from a standardized methodology (Westoby, 1998; Weiher et al., 1999). This should lead to the constitution of databases of plant traits (S. Gachet et al., Université d'Aix-Marseille) (Fitter & Peat, 1994) that can be used to test hypotheses related both to the distribution of plant species and to the impact of changes in species distribution on ecosystem functioning. Important common basic and methodological issues concern the concept of functional group, as opposed to functional trait. Indeed, except in cases with distinct qualitative variation in function (e.g. nitrogen-fixing in plants, different trophic levels in the soil or aquatic ecosystems), variation in function is quantitative and continuously related to one or a few traits (e.g. specific leaf area in plants, body size in animals). One may then be justified in challenging the need to establish groups, whereas the interesting question lies in the identification of the determining traits, trade-offs among them, and quantitative relationships between these traits and specific ecosystem functions. For example, plant specific leaf area has been shown to correlate with ecosystem productivity (Reich et al., 1997) and rate of litter decomposition (Cornelissen et al., 1999). In the same way, animal body size relates to metabolic rates and population properties such as fecundity. Few studies to date have focused systematically on the types of relationships that may be found between traits and functions, and especially on the structure of the inter- and intraspecific variance around these relationships. When groups may be needed, as in the case of vegetation mapping, modelling, or management of diverse ecosystems, fuzzy classifications such as those used in palaeo-ecology (S. Gachet et al. Université d'Aix-Marseille) (Sykes et al., 1996) are likely to be more relevant than classical hierarchical classification methods (Pillar, 1999). In any case, formal studies of the effects of methods for aggregating species on predicted ecosystem function are essential (N. Picard, CIRAD Forêts, Montpellier, France). The usefulness of functional groups has been demonstrated, at least intuitively, for forest management (J.-C. Rameau, ENGREF, Nancy, France), and managed grasslands or rangelands (Sinclair & Arcese, 1995; Díaz et al., 2001). However, the difficulty of obtaining classifications relevant to multiple functions makes it difficult to manage for integrated functionality of the ecosystem. Part of this problem may be solved by changing the focus from indicator groups to indicator traits, acknowledging that several traits will probably be needed for assessing the status or dynamics of managed ecosystems. The concept of species functional group has developed at a different pace and with different perspectives in various biological disciplines. A substantial effort should be made to harmonize terminology, thereby improving communication across and within fields. For all organisms, one of the most exciting challenges lies in the identification of key traits of species related both to their response to environmental factors and to ecosystem functioning. The meeting, part of the the French Ecophysiological Society and the Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems (IGBP) programme, was organized by Marie-Laure Navas (Ecole Nationale Supérieure Agronomique de Montpellier (ENSA-M, Montpellier, France), Eric Garnier, Sandra Lavorel and Catherine Roumet (CEFE-CNRS, Montpellier, France).

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2016.05.001,An Ecological and Evolutionary Framework for Commensalism in Anthropogenic Environments,"The definition of commensal taxa should be based on dependency. The concept of anthrodependent taxa leads to new species categorised as commensal. Commensals give insight into selective pressures in rapidly changing environments. Commensalism within anthropogenic environments has not been extensively discussed, despite its impact on humans, and there is no formal framework for assessing this ecological relationship in its varied forms. Here, we examine commensalism in anthropogenic environments in detail, considering both ecological and evolutionary drivers. The many assumptions about commensalism and the nature of anthropogenic environments are discussed and we highlight dependency as a key attribute of anthropogenic commensals (anthrodependent taxa). We primarily focus on mammalian species in the anthropogenic-commensal niche, but the traits described and selective pressures presented are likely fundamental to many species engaged in intense commensal relationships with humans. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this largely understudied interaction represents an important opportunity to investigate evolutionary processes in rapidly changing environments.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that this largely understudied interaction represents an important opportunity to investigate evolutionary processes in rapidly changing environments. Commensal taxa (see Glossary) have been major contributors to the human-mediated biodiversity crisis [1Stenseth N.C. et al.Mice, rats, and people: the bio-economics of agricultural rodent pests.Front. Ecol. Environ. 2003; 1: 367-375Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 2Martin L.J. et al.Evolution of the indoor biome.Trends Ecol.

Rev. 2014; 44: 148-162Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar], and were possible sources of domesticates [4Larson G. Fuller D.Q. The evolution of animal domestication.Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 2014; 45: 271-295Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 5Zeder M.A. Pathways to animal domestication.in: Gepts P. Biodiversity in Agriculture: Domestication, Evolution and Sustainability. Cambridge University Press, 2012: 227-259Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar]; thus, they have a profound impact on life on Earth. However, many aspects of this relationship, and the ecological and evolutionary processes associated with commensal taxa, are surprisingly poorly understood. This stems from the seemingly simple definition of commensalism: a relationship where one species benefits (+) and the other species experiences no impact (0) [6Johnson N.C. et al.Functioning of mycorrhizal associations along the mutualism-parasitism continuum.New Phytol. 1997; 135: 575-585Crossref Scopus (1356) Google Scholar]. Observations of animals benefitting from anthropogenic environments often lead to the conclusion that these animals are undergoing commensal-specific evolution. There are many assumptions associated with this evolutionary process, which we break down in this paper. We contend that anthropogenic environments are highly unstable and do not entirely buffer commensal species from seasonality. Therefore, the evolution of commensal taxa is defined by their ability to become dependent on these unstable anthropogenic environments. Observations of commensal interactions have led researchers in fields such as archaeology and studies of domestication to categorise species as commensally dependent, but without providing a wider ecological context. For example, because there is currently no adequate ecology-based framework for commensal evolution, the view that feral dog populations are reasonable models for 'proto-domestic' forms (e.g., [4Larson G. Fuller D.Q. The evolution of animal domestication.Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 2014; 45: 271-295Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 7Coppinger R. Coppinger L. A Startling New Understanding of Canine Origins, Behaviour and Evolution. Scribner, 2001Google Scholar]) has not been assessed with sufficient rigour. The assumption that domestic dogs derive ultimately from commensal wolves, therefore remains a premise underpinning much of the research into dog domestication (e.g., [8Axelsson E. et al.The genomic signature of dog domestication reveals adaptation to a starch-rich diet.Nature. 2013; 495: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar]). Although wolves do engage in commensal relationships with humans as facultative scavengers (e.g., [9Boitani L. Ciucci P. Comparative social ecology of feral dogs and wolves.Ethol. Ecol. Evol. 1995; 7: 49-72Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar]), whether it is possible for a subgroup of wolves, prior to direct human interaction, truly to become a commensal taxon in the evolutionary sense remains untested. A review of the current usage of the term 'commensalism' in anthropogenic environments highlights how dependence is central to the understanding of commensal taxa. Here, we identify the unpredictability and instability of the anthropogenic niche as the primary selective pressures involved in the evolution of commensal species. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an ecological framework is required to: (i) identify the intensity of the relationship in order to define a taxon as commensal; (ii) assess the complexities of ecological systems associated with commensals; and (iii) assess selective pressures on commensal taxa that drive their evolution. We propose a new term for organisms that might represent the typical commensal condition in an anthropogenic environment: 'anthrodependent taxa' or 'anthrodependants' (Box 1).Box 1Previously Used Definitions of Species in Anthropogenic Environments (with Our Proposed New Category*)Commensal taxa (com-: sharing and -mensa: table)Commensalism in its original and simplest form specifies a relationship, represented as +/0, whereby one organism benefits (+) from another without causing deleterious effects to the other (0) [6Johnson N.C. et al.Functioning of mycorrhizal associations along the mutualism-parasitism continuum.New Phytol. 1997; 135: 575-585Crossref Scopus (1356) Google Scholar]. As applied to taxa, rather than relationships, it often refers to species living within houses [10Aplin K.P. et al.Evolutionary biology of the genus Rattus: profile of an archetypal rodent pest.in: Singleton G.R.

More precisely, 'true commensals' live entirely in houses, 'occasional commensals' move between houses and outdoor habitats, and 'obligate commensals' are those that can only survive in an area because of their ability to occupy houses (e.g., black rats in northern Europe).Synanthropic and synurban taxa (syn-: together)These terms are used in studies of species that continue to live in areas that are occupied and altered by humans [83Baker P.J.

The term 'commensal', denoting a relationship, has a straightforward meaning [6Johnson N.C. et al.Functioning of mycorrhizal associations along the mutualism-parasitism continuum.New Phytol. 1997; 135: 575-585Crossref Scopus (1356) Google Scholar]. However, when the term is applied to a taxon (e.g., to rodents [10Aplin K.P. et al.Evolutionary biology of the genus Rattus: profile of an archetypal rodent pest.in: Singleton G.R. Rats, Mice and People: Rodent Biology Management. ACIAR, 2003: 487-498Google Scholar] or to a so-called 'proto-domestic' species [4Larson G. Fuller D.Q. The evolution of animal domestication.Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 2014; 45: 271-295Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar]), it often means something more complex, reflecting both the acquisition of a new capability to exploit the anthropogenic environment and an associated reliance upon it. Furthermore, as the relationship becomes more intense (one of dependence), these 'commensal taxa' rarely have a neutral impact on humans; for example, they consume crops, steal food, and/or harbour disease [3Capizzi D. et al.Rating the rat: global patterns and research priorities in impacts and management of rodent pests.Mamm.

Rev. 2014; 44: 148-162Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar]. Their role as disease vectors might be considered a key negative impact [11Morand S. et al.Global parasite and Rattus rodent invasions: the consequences for rodent-borne diseases.Integr. Zool. 2013; 10: 409-423Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar], but it is entirely indirect, given that essentially no energy is expended to spread the disease (although parasite-induced behaviours exist [91Webster J.P. Rats, cats, people and parasites: the impact of latent toxoplasmosis on behaviour.Microbes Infect. 2001; 3: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar]). Competition for resources is understood to be a–/–relationship [6Johnson N.C. et al.Functioning of mycorrhizal associations along the mutualism-parasitism continuum.New Phytol. 1997; 135: 575-585Crossref Scopus (1356) Google Scholar], with more obvious direct interaction. However, the comparison between the impact of disease and the damage from competition is difficult to quantify and might suggest that, when present, the indirect pathogen impact has a greater and more acute effect than the direct competition resulting from crop consumption [3Capizzi D. et al.Rating the rat: global patterns and research priorities in impacts and management of rodent pests.Mamm. Rev. 2014; 44: 148-162Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar]. Also, should we take into account the ability of humans to mitigate such impacts when considering whether a relationship is largely neutral or otherwise? Another question that is raised by the quantification of interactions is whether negative interactions are overriding and additive or whether they can be balanced by beneficial activities. Feral cats are a possible commensal species; they carry toxoplasmosis, a disease known to affect humans [91Webster J.P. Rats, cats, people and parasites: the impact of latent toxoplasmosis on behaviour.Microbes Infect. 2001; 3: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar], but they also consume and regulate populations of other species known to carry many more diseases [11Morand S. et al.Global parasite and Rattus rodent invasions: the consequences for rodent-borne diseases.Integr. Zool. 2013; 10: 409-423Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar]. Feral cats consume competitors of humans (rodents), so if disease is not considered, does that then make the relationship mutual? Does the perceived beneficial behaviour of feral cats mitigate the negative impact they can have on humans? Ultimately, this extremely complex set of impacts affects the evolution of all organisms involved but, on an evolutionary ecology scale, it is currently unquantifiable. As a result, it might be best to simply categorise these interactions as fluctuating and complex rather than trying to define them as negative or neutral. Many so-called 'commensal' species have anything but a neutral relationship with humans [3Capizzi D. et al.Rating the rat: global patterns and research priorities in impacts and management of rodent pests.Mamm. Rev. 2014; 44: 148-162Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar].

Ultimately, this extremely complex set of impacts affects the evolution of all organisms involved but, on an evolutionary ecology scale, it is currently unquantifiable. As a result, it might be best to simply categorise these interactions as fluctuating and complex rather than trying to define them as negative or neutral. Taxa categorised as 'commensal' are reasonably assumed to be exposed to selective pressures relating to their exploitation of the anthropogenic niche [12Pocock M.J.O. et al.Adaptations of animals to commensal habitats: population dynamics of house mice Mus musculus domesticus on farms.J. Anim. Ecol. 2004; 73: 878-888Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar]. However, just what the main characteristics of the anthropogenic niche are (beyond a simplistic view that it represents a concentration of resources associated in some way with humans) remains unexplored, and this has led to further broad assumptions being made about evolutionary pressures on proposed commensal taxa (e.g. [8Axelsson E. et al.The genomic signature of dog domestication reveals adaptation to a starch-rich diet.Nature. 2013; 495: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar]). Beyond the obvious settings of human-made structures and urban environments, it must also be recognised that agricultural environments are also subject to unpredictable and unseasonal human activity, resulting in 'unnatural' availability of resources. These too have a range of associated dependent taxa, often considered 'pests'. At low densities, such taxa might be considered to hold commensal relationships, but, as densities become higher, they might be viewed as competitors, although these categories are largely subjective. From an ecological and evolutionary perspective, these competing taxa inhabit an unpredictable and fluctuating anthropogenic environment similar to that experienced by many commensals and, therefore, can be considered anthrodependent with a commensal origin. Other discrepancies in definitions stem from a research bias towards small-bodied animals living in human-made structures [10Aplin K.P. et al.Evolutionary biology of the genus Rattus: profile of an archetypal rodent pest.in: Singleton G.R. Rats, Mice and People: Rodent Biology Management. ACIAR, 2003: 487-498Google Scholar, 12Pocock M.J.O. et al.Adaptations of animals to commensal habitats: population dynamics of house mice Mus musculus domesticus on farms.J. Anim. Ecol. 2004; 73: 878-888Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar]. Occupation of such structures sets an arbitrary definition of 'commensal taxa' with the result that comparisons of similar evolutionary processes experienced by large-bodied species are overlooked. In this way, a unifying definition and understanding is needed of 'commensal taxa' that allows an evolutionary understanding and is transferable between taxa (with varying body and home-range sizes) that occupy different anthropogenic environments and exploit diverse anthropogenic resources. Far more useful is to consider commensalism (and other related types of species interaction) in terms of the degree of dependence upon an anthropogenic niche (Figure 1). Dependency comes with both benefits and costs, which in turn drive the evolution of anthrodependent taxa [5Zeder M.A. Pathways to animal domestication.in: Gepts P. Biodiversity in Agriculture: Domestication, Evolution and Sustainability. Cambridge University Press, 2012: 227-259Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar]. Examining the selective pressures stemming from both benefits and costs provides a more appropriate framework that allows detailed insight into evolutionary processes specifically associated with past, present, and future anthropogenic environments. Only by interrogating the archaeological record will we gain a fuller understanding of the way such taxa evolve and adapt [13Weissbrod L. Biological indicators of occupation intensity: an environmental ethnoarchaeology of Maasai ettlements.in: Dean R.M. The Archaeology of Anthropogenic Environments. Illinois University Press, 2010: 295-320Google Scholar]. Humans have been actively altering the environment around them for thousands of years in what can be considered a form of niche construction [14Zeder M.A. Domestication as a model system for niche construction theory.Evol. Ecol. 2016; 30: 325-348Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar]. It is this constructed environment, and the abundance of resources within it, to which anthrodependent taxa have adapted and thrived. The extent of anthropogenic environments has increased through time [14Zeder M.A. Domestication as a model system for niche construction theory.Evol. Ecol. 2016; 30: 325-348Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar], as has the prevalence of commensal taxa [15Cucchi T. et al.On the trail of Neolithic mice and men towards Transcaucasia: zooarchaeological clues from Nakhchivan (Azerbaijan).Biol. J. Linn. Soc. 2013; 108: 917-928Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar]. The ability of a taxon to maintain access to anthropogenic environments dictates its success and evolution as an anthrodependant. In particular, this environment is often characterised by extreme and unpredictable fluctuations of resource availability and nest sites [12Pocock M.J.O. et al.Adaptations of animals to commensal habitats: population dynamics of house mice Mus musculus domesticus on farms.J. Anim. Ecol. 2004; 73: 878-888Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Newsome A.E. A population study of house-mice temporarily inhabiting a South Australian wheatfield.J. Anim. Ecol. 1969; 38: 341-359Crossref Google Scholar], characteristics that are frequently overlooked. It is often assumed that anthropogenic environments are more stable in terms of resource availability than are natural environments [17Anderies J.M. et al.Living in the city: resource availability, predation, and bird population dynamics in urban areas.J. Theor. Biol. 2007; 247: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar]. This is not always the case [12Pocock M.J.O. et al.Adaptations of animals to commensal habitats: population dynamics of house mice Mus musculus domesticus on farms.J. Anim. Ecol. 2004; 73: 878-888Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar]; neither was it likely to have been so throughout the past, when wild organisms first entered the anthropogenic niche [13Weissbrod L.

https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.6648,Differences in prey personality mediate trophic cascades,"Abstract Functional trait approaches in ecology chiefly assume the mean trait value of a population adequately predicts the outcome of species interactions. Yet this assumption ignores substantial trait variation among individuals within a population, which can have a profound effect on community structure and function. We explored individual trait variation through the lens of animal personality to test whether among‐individual variation in prey behavior mediates trophic interactions. We quantified the structure of personalities within a population of generalist grasshoppers and examined, through a number of field and laboratory‐based experiments, how personality types could impact tri‐trophic interactions in a food chain. Unlike other studies of this nature, we used spatial habitat domains to evaluate how personality types mechanistically map to behaviors relevant in predator–prey dynamics and found shy and bold individuals differed in both their habitat use and foraging strategy under predation risk by a sit‐and‐wait spider predator. In the field‐based mesocosm portion of our study, we found experimental populations of personality types differed in their trophic impact, demonstrating that prey personality can mediate trophic cascades. We found no differences in respiration rates or body size between personality types used in the mesocosm experiment, indicating relative differences in trophic impact were not due to variation in prey physiology but rather variation in behavioral strategies. Our work demonstrates how embracing the complexity of individual trait variation can offer mechanistically richer understanding of the processes underlying trophic interactions.",W3049278712,True,0.9975292682647705
https://doi.org/10.1111/jeb.12381,Interactive effects of competition and social environment on the expression of sexual dimorphism,"Abstract The expression of sexual dimorphism is expected to be influenced by the acquisition of resources available to allocate to trait growth, combined with sex‐specific patterns of resource allocation. Resource acquisition in the wild may be mediated by a variety of ecological factors, such as the density of interspecific competitors. Allocation may in turn depend on social contexts, such as sex ratio, that alter the pay‐off for investment in sexual traits. How these factors interact to promote or constrain the expression and evolution of sexual dimorphism is poorly understood. We manipulated sex ratio and interspecific resource competition over the growing season of red‐spotted newts ( Notophthalmus viridescens ) in artificial ponds. Fish competitors had a stronger effect on female than male growth, which effectively eliminated the expression of sexual size dimorphism. In addition, newt sex ratio influenced fish growth, leading to reduction in fish mass with an increase in female newt frequency. Fish also reduced the expression of male tail height, a sexually selected trait, but only in tanks with a female‐biased sex ratio. This suggests males alter their resource allocation pattern in response to the strength of sexual selection. Our results demonstrate that ecologically and socially mediated interactions between sex‐specific resource acquisition and allocation can contribute to variation in the expression of sexual dimorphism.",W2156928578,True,0.9446123838424683

Often very abrupt boundaries form between these two habitats, giving rise to a mosaic pattern of contrasting shrub‐grass alterations across the landscape. Reasons for such patterning remain poorly understood though current niche‐based views relate species' distributions to spatial resource gradients or to fire effects. Field survey work was conducted on central Australian mountain ranges to further quantify floristic, regeneration traits, and structural patterning across mulga‐spinifex transitions and to test resource‐ and disturbance‐models that explain these patterns. Compositional analysis demonstrated variability in transition type – in certain cases boundaries denoted true floristic discontinuity and in others, somewhat more of a structural shift. Moreover, it was shown that minimal between‐habitat floristic overlap coincided with the occurrence of distinct edaphic changes, while greater compositional commonality occurred when soil gradients were more diffuse. This indicated that floristic patterning cannot be ascribed to any one single process. In the case of strong soil gradients, between‐habitat segregation most likely resulted from resource‐based niche differentiation; for weaker gradients, fire‐frequency assumed greatest importance. Disturbance theory most readily accounted for the distribution of woody species' post‐fire regeneration traits across habitat boundaries. The results also suggested that biotic factors – viz competition, facilitation and animal‐mediated dispersal – may be of additional consequence for mulga‐spinifex coexistence. Overall, the study served to emphasize the importance of multi‐factor explanation for within‐ and between‐habitat patterning in these mosaics. It also highlighted the need for experimentation to facilitate distinction between cause and correlation.",W2095610623,True,0.9753500819206238

In response, marine reserves can be used to protect exploited species and conserve biodiversity. The increased abundance of predatory species in marine reserves may cause indirect effects along chains of multi-trophic interactions. These trophic cascades can arise through direct predation, density-mediated indirect interactions (DMIIs), or indirect behavioural effects, termed trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs). The extent of algal cover and the abundance of 4 primary consumers were determined in Lough Hyne, which was designated Europe’s first marine nature reserve in 1981. The primary consumers were the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, the topshell Gibbula cineraria, the oyster Anomia ephippium, and the scallop Chlamys varia. The abundances of 3 starfish species (Marthasterias glacialis, Asterias rubens, and Asterina gibbosa) were also determined, as were 2 potential crustacean predators, Necora puber and Carcinus maenas. These data were compared with historical data from a 1962 (prey) and a 1963 (predator) survey to determine the nature of community interactions over adjacent trophic levels. The present study reveals a breakdown in population structure of the 4 surveyed prey species. Marine reserve designation has led to an increase in predatory crabs and M. glacialis, a subsequent decrease in primary consumers, ­especially the herbivore P. lividus, and an increase in macroalgal cover which is indicative of a trophic cascade. The study shows that establishing a Marine Reserve does not guarantee that ­conservation benefits will be distributed equally.

https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2744,An experimental test of how parasites of predators can influence trophic cascades and ecosystem functioning,"Abstract Parasites can shape the structure and function of ecosystems by influencing both the density and traits of their hosts. Such changes in ecosystems are particularly likely when the host is a predator that mediates the dynamics of trophic cascades. Here, we experimentally tested how parasite load of a small predatory fish, the threespine stickleback, can affect the occurrence and strength of trophic cascades and ecosystem functioning. In a factorial mesocosm experiment, we manipulated the density of stickleback (low vs. high), and the level of parasite load (natural vs. reduced). In addition, we used two stickleback populations from different lineages: an eastern European lineage with a more pelagic phenotype (Lake Constance) and a western European lineage with a more benthic phenotype (Lake Geneva). We found that stickleback caused trophic cascades in the pelagic but not the benthic food chain. Evidence for pelagic trophic cascades was stronger in treatments where parasite load of stickleback was reduced with an antihelmintic medication, and where fish originated from Lake Constance (i.e., the more pelagic lineage). A structural equation model revealed that differences in stickleback lineage and parasite load were most likely to impact trophic cascades via changes in the composition, rather than overall biomass, of zooplankton communities. Overall, our results provide experimental evidence that parasites of predators can influence the cascading effects of fish on lower trophic levels with consequences on ecosystem functioning.",W2947555453,True,0.9932331442832947
https://doi.org/10.1002/imt2.194,Long‐term nitrogen input reduces soil bacterial network complexity by shifts in life history strategy in temperate grassland,"We investigated soil bacterial and fungal communities, constructed co-occurrence networks, and estimated bacterial traits along a gradient of nitrogen (N) input. The results showed that soil bacterial co-occurrence networks complexity decreased with increasing N input. The ratio of negative to positive cohesion decreased with increasing N input, suggesting the declined competitive but strengthened cooperative interactions. However, soil fungal network complexity did not change under N enrichment. In addition, N input stimulated the copiotroph/oligotroph ratio, ribosomal RNA operon (rrn) copy number, and guanine-cytosine (GC) content of soil bacteria, shifting bacterial life history strategy toward copiotroph with increased r-/K-strategy ratio. Piecewise structural equation modeling results further revealed that the reduction in bacterial co-occurrence network complexity was directly regulated by the increased bacterial r-/K-strategy ratio, rather than reduced bacterial richness. Our study reveals the mechanisms through which microbial traits regulate interactions and shape co-occurrence networks under global changes. Nitrogen (N) deposition induced by the emission of nitrogenous compounds from the combustion of fossil fuels and the application of N fertilizers has risen by 200% and is projected to double by 2050 in various regions worldwide [1]. The subsequent N enrichment poses serious threats to plant diversity, community, and the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, particularly grasslands [2]. Ecosystem function is associated with not only changes in plants but also the dynamics of soil microbes in response to N input [3]. Alterations in microbial populations can trigger changes in interactions among microorganisms, which play an important role in maintaining microbial network complexity, stability, and function [4]. Thus, understanding microbial co-occurrence and interaction is essential in the prediction of ecosystem processes and function in response to N enrichment in grassland ecosystems. Microbial interaction comprises cooperative and competitive components and generally links to richness. However, a few recent studies of N enrichment on microbial interactions have produced mixed results, irrespective of changes in microbial richness [5-7]. Specifically, some studies reported an increase in soil bacterial interactions and network complexity following N application, attributing to an increased number of keystone taxa [6]. Conversely, an investigation of a 150-year manipulative N application showed a significant reduction in the complexity of soil bacterial networks, coupling with a decline in cooperative relationships within communities [5]. Furthermore, one multilevel N application study indicated higher bacterial network complexity under lower N input but diminished complexity under higher N input with the same trend of cooperative relationships [7]. Across those studies, the responses of cooperative relationships to N input were found to align with alterations in bacterial network complexity. Different from the regulatory effect of cooperation on microbial network complexity, some community ecologists have proposed that the existence of competitive interaction facilitates high-order interaction and consequently enhances the complexity and stability of co-occurrence networks [4]. That said, the enhancement of competitive interactions contributes to microbial network complexity. Accordingly, the above observations of declined cooperation with simplified network complexity seem contradictory to this theoretical coexistence conceptual statement between positive (negative) interactions and complexity. Therefore, despite extensive investigations into microbial diversity and communities in grassland ecosystems globally, there is still a severe lack of information regarding how microbial interactions and network complexity respond to N enrichment and their underlying mechanisms. Here, we investigate microbial co-occurrence networks along a gradient of manipulative N input in a temperate grassland in China. This study aims to explore how soil microbial interactions respond to N input and elucidate the potential driving factors and mechanisms. We will address the following questions: (1) Whether the reduced microbial richness will lead to the diminution in microbial network complexity under N enrichment? (2) How do cooperative (competitive) interactions change in microbial network complexity in response to N enrichment? (3) Given that soil fungi are more closely connected to plants, will N input exert a more pronounced impact on fungal network complexity? The experimental site is located in the semiarid grassland of Duolun County, Inner Mongolia, China. A Latin square design was utilized since 2003, comprising a total 8 N application levels (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 g N m−2 y−1). Soil samples were collected in August 2016 and used for sequencing and chemical analyses (see Supporting Information: Methods). With increasing N input, there was a pronounced diminishing trend in the number of nodes and edges, average degree, clustering coefficient, and the first axis of principal component analysis (PC1) of bacterial network characteristics (Figure 1A,B and S1). Similar to topological parameters, the total, positive, negative cohesion, and negative/positive value of bacterial communities decreased with increasing N input (Figure 1C). However, N input did not alter soil fungal network complexity (Figure S2). The copiotroph/oligotroph ratio, ribosomal RNA operon (rrn) copy number, guanine-cytosine (GC) content, and the PC1 value representing the overall bacterial r-/K-strategy ratio gradually increased with the elevated N input (Figure 2A). Total cohesion exhibited a positive correlation with bacterial richness but a negative correlation with the r-/K-strategy ratio (Figure 2B). Piecewise structural equation modeling (SEM) results showed that N input, by increasing soil dissolved inorganic N content (DIN) and decreasing soil pH, altered the bacterial r-/K-strategy ratio. The bacterial r-/K-strategy ratio negatively affected bacterial richness. Total bacterial cohesion had a direct negative association with the r-/K-strategy ratio but had no association with bacterial richness (Figure 2C). In line with greater rrn copy number under high N conditions [8], we found that N input stimulated soil DIN and increased bacterial rrn copy number toward the copiotrophic community (Figure S3). We further found that GC content increased by N application. According to the rule of molecular biosynthesis, each GC at base pairs requires 8 N atoms while adenine-thymine (AT) at base pairs requires only 7 N atoms [9]. Therefore, the ""resource-driven selection"" theory proposes that N limitation is a strong selective force that causes the relatively low GC content [10, 11]. Consequently, the greater soil N would result in nucleotide sequences with G+C bias by alleviating N limitation. Different from the previous reports that GC content positively correlated with soil pH at a regional scale [11], GC content negatively related to soil pH in our study (Figure S4). This may be due to a decrease in soil pH caused by extra N application. Overall, a higher bacterial r-/K-strategy ratio indicates that bacterial life history strategy tends toward r-selection strategy. The stimulated r-/K-strategy ratio supports ""resource-driven selection"" in bacterial communities in response to N enrichment in the temperate grassland. The reduced bacterial network complexity under high N input was accompanied by a reduction in richness which was found in our previous work [12] and exhibited a positive correlation (Figure 2B). Note that we found that reduced richness was ascribed to the loss of oligotrophic taxa (Figure S5), which resulted in a shift in life history strategy. When controlling for the r-/K-strategy ratio, the partial correlation of total cohesion with richness is no longer significant (Figure 2B). Furthermore, the SEM results also revealed that bacterial community complexity was negatively associated with the r-/K-strategy ratio, implying that the tightness of bacterial connections was driven by life history strategies rather than bacterial richness (Figure 2B,C and S6). Oligotrophic taxa generally acquire nutrients or energy from various complex recalcitrant matter [13]. This acquisition process consists of multiple metabolic pathways involving various microorganisms, establishing more effective and stronger complex connections among microbial taxa [8]. However, N input stimulates plant growth and consequent fresh carbon inputs (Figure S7), producing sufficient energy supply and labile substrates [14]. The excessive N as well as substrate application facilitates copiotroph and promotes bacterial independence, weakening the complex connections and leading to less connectivity [5], thus simplifying co-occurrence networks. This finding that the r-/K-strategy ratio mediates bacterial co-occurrence network complexity points out the regulatory role of bacterial genetic and coding traits in taxa co-occurrence. We speculated that the reduced cohesion would be linked to the deconstruction of high-order interaction in a community. Interaction chains refer to the indirect impacts of one species on another through changes in the abundance of a third species beyond the pairwise interactions [15]. These emerged interaction chains can produce high-order interactions obtaining more diverse pairwise relationships and maintaining complex and robust co-occurrence networks [4]. The reduced cohesion and simplified bacterial co-occurrence network, in turn, to some degree, suggest the deconstruction of high-order interactions as well as a shift toward low-order interactions under N enrichment. The ratio between negative and positive cohesion represents the changes in competitive or cooperative strength. A higher ratio indicates greater competition among taxa within the community. Opposite to the increased negative/positive ratio in typical grassland [7], our results showed a decreased negative/positive cohesion ratio with increasing N input. This indicates a diminishment of competition and reinforcement of cooperation within the community. Specifically, extra N input directly alleviates the competition for nutrients and could weaken the competitive interactions [6]. In addition, the fast growth and metabolism within diverse taxa will produce metabolites to facilitate the exchange of energy and materials among taxa called cross-feeding to enhance cooperation [16]. Correspondingly, we found enhanced cooperation with an increased bacterial r-/K-strategy ratio (Figure S8). Moreover, certain competition can promote coexistence by equalizing the fitness of the other taxa within the community [17]. The loss of such competitors may lead to the subsequent loss of others and a simplified co-occurrence network [15]. The concurrent decreasing competitive interaction and simplified network emphasize the role of competition in maintaining species coexistence. The finding of unchanged soil fungal co-occurrence network complexity did not support our third hypothesis that soil fungi would be more responsive to N input. The unchanged co-occurrence network could be attributed to the physiological and morphological properties of soil fungi. Soil fungi generally have a great capacity to mineralize complex organic compounds for N [18]. Moreover, they also have high N use efficiency in biomass accumulation and a high C/N ratio [19]. Those two characteristics facilitate soil fungal growth under low N conditions with less dependence on extra N input, manifesting insensitive to N input. Furthermore, the thick cell walls and intrinsic spores exhibit high tolerance to soil acidification and metal toxicity [18], remaining stable under N enrichment. The feature of fungal mycelium enables it to penetrate and spread underground to establish a hyphal network [20]. Consequently, soil fungal hyphal network can extend over a wider spatial distribution and is therefore resistant to environmental change. In conclusion, our study demonstrates distinct patterns of changes in bacterial and fungal networks and interactions along the gradient of increasing N input in a temperate steppe. As N input increased, bacterial network complexity exhibited a downward trend, accompanied by a decline in the negative/positive cohesion ratio, while the network complexity of fungal communities remained unaltered. We further found that the decline in bacterial network complexity was driven by the increase in bacterial r-/K-strategy ratio under N enrichment. It is worth noting that this result is derived from a study over a decade of N input. Given the cumulative effect of N application over time, the temporal dynamics of soil bacterial network complexity in response to N input should be considered when extrapolating. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first empirical report that the reduced bacterial complexity is predominantly ascribed to the changes in bacterial life history strategy traits under N enrichment in grassland ecosystems. This finding provides insights into a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which microbial traits modulate co-occurrence networks and interactions in response to environmental changes.

https://doi.org/10.1086/661926,Determinants of Northerly Range Limits along the Himalayan Bird Diversity Gradient,"The primary explanation for the latitudinal gradient in species diversity must lie in why species fail to expand ranges across different climatic regimes. Theories of species gradients based in niche conservatism assume that whole clades are confined to particular climatic regimes because the traits they share limit adaptation to alternative regimes. We assess these theories in an analysis of the twofold decline in bird species richness along the Himalayas from the southeast to the northwest. The presence of fewer species in the northwest is entirely due to a steep decline in the number of forest species; species occupying more open habitats show a reversed gradient. Forest species numbers are exceptionally high at midelevations (1,000-2,000 m) in the southeast, which experience a warm, wet climate not present in the northwest, and a high proportion of these species fail to expand their range to the northwest. Despite this, many species do have populations or close relatives that straddle different climatic regimes along altitudinal gradients and/or the regional gradient, implying that climate-based niche conservatism per se does not strongly constrain range limits. We argue that climate- and competition-mediated resource distributions are important in setting northerly range limits and show that one measure of forest resources (foliage density) is lower in the northwest.",W1975586176,True,0.9436394572257996

The presence of predatory fish was found to alter the foraging activities of the baetid. but not of the glossosomatid. We investigated the local distribution of Baetis thermicus and Glossosoma sp. to examine the potential for competition between the two grazers in a northern Japanese stream. Further, we carried our a laboratory experiment to test the hypothesis that the freshwater sculpin Cottus nozawae, when not allowed to attack prey, mediates the resource-limited competitive influences of Baetly on the growth of Glossosoma, but not the reverse. We found a negative correlation between the densities of Baetis and Glossosoma in the stream, suggesting the strong potential for resource-limiting competitive interactions to occur between the grazers. Using a laboratory channel experiment employing a target-neighbor design, neither the presence of sculpin nor the density of the two grazers altered any life-history traits measured for the grazers. However, the proportion of Baetis individuals positioned on the upper surface of a ceramic plate substrate (with greater periphyton biomass) largely decreased in the presence of sculpin, with only a minor behavioral shift being detected in Glossasoma. This difference in behavioral shift resulted in greater growth suppression in Baetis than in Glossosoma. In the absence of sculpin, growth of both target grazers was lowered by experimentally increasing the density of neighboring competitors. In partial contradiction to the above hypothesis, the growth of not only Glossosoma but also Baetis was never influenced by the density of neighbor competitors when sculpin were present. The biomass of periphyton in the presence of sculpin was greater than when sculpin were absent, and was lower with higher densities of either grazer. Predator-avoidance behavioral modifications in both grazers may be the mechanism responsible for mediation of their exploitative competition.",W2094194527,True,0.9901555776596069

Climate factors interact with plant traits to mediate tree survival. This study investigated survival dynamics in Norway spruce (Picea abies) in relation to tree-level morphological traits during a prolonged multi-year outbreak of the bark beetle, Ips typographus, in Central Europe. We acquired datasets describing the trait attributes of individual spruce using remote sensing and field surveys. We used nonlinear regression in a hypothesis-driven framework to quantify survival probability as a function of tree size, crown morphology, intraspecific competition and a growing season water balance. Extant spruce trees that persisted through the outbreak were spatially clustered, suggesting that survival was a non-random process. Larger diameter trees were more susceptible to bark beetles, reflecting either life history tradeoffs or a dynamic interaction between defense capacity and insect aggregation behavior. Competition had a strong negative effect on survival, presumably through resource limitation. Trees with more extensive crowns were buffered against bark beetles, ostensibly by a more robust photosynthetic capability and greater carbon reserves. The outbreak spanned a warming trend and conditions of anomalous aridity. Sustained water limitation during this period amplified the consequences of other factors, rendering even smaller trees vulnerable to colonization by insects. Our results are in agreement with prior research indicating that climate change has the potential to intensify bark beetle activity. However, forest outcomes will depend on complex cross-scale interactions between global climate trends and tree-level trait factors, as well as feedback effects associated with landscape patterns of stand structural diversity.",W4281761255,True,0.9774553179740906

Compounding effects of urbanization and introduced species on native bees are, however, unclear. Here, we investigated how honey bee abundance and foraging patterns related to those of native bee abundance and diversity in residential gardens and native vegetation remnants for 2 years in urbanized areas of the Southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot and assessed how niche overlap influenced these relationships. Honey bees did not overtly suppress native bee abundance; however, complex relationships emerged when analysing these relationships according to body size, time of day and floral resource levels. Native bee richness was positively correlated with overall honeybee abundance in the first year, but negatively correlated in the second year, and varied with body size. Native bees that had higher resource overlap with honey bees were negatively associated with honey bee abundance, and resource overlap between honey bees and native bees was higher in residential gardens. Relationships with honey bees varied between native bee taxa, reflecting adaptations to different flora, plus specialization.

To explore effects of habitat patchiness and variation in perceived risk of predation on food-web dynamics, we conducted a factorial experiment in a model aquatic food chain of predator−prey−resource using 2 contrasting predators (adult blue crab Callinectes sapidus and toad fish Opsanus tau), juvenile blue crab as prey, and mussel Geukensia demissa as resource. Both predator presence and habitat patchiness influenced the prey's preference for consuming resources at patch edges instead of interiors. The preference of prey for consuming resources at habitat edges was 4 times stronger in continuous oyster reef habitat than in smaller habitat patches. This suggests that interior resources in continuous habitat experience a refuge from consumption, but this refuge is largely lost in patchy habitat. The mere presence of predators reduced the prey's preference for consuming resources at habitat edges. This BMIE was significant for the ambush predator (toadfish) and the treatment containing both predators, but not for the actively hunting predator (adult blue crab). We conclude that habitat patchiness and predator presence can jointly affect resource distribution by inducing shifts in prey foraging behavior, revealing a need to incorporate BMIEs into habitat fragmentation studies. This conclusion has broad and growing relevance as anthropogenic factors increasingly modify predator abundances and fragment coastal habitats.

https://doi.org/10.1086/670821,Heterospecific Aggression and Dominance in a Guild of Coral-Feeding Fishes: The Roles of Dietary Ecology and Phylogeny,"Interspecific competition mediates biodiversity maintenance and is an important selective pressure for evolution. Competition is often conceptualized as being exploitative (indirect) or involving direct interference. However, most empirical studies are phenomenological, focusing on quantifying effects of density manipulations, and most competition theory has characterized exploitation competition systems. The effects on resource use of traits associated with direct, interference competition has received far less attention. Here we examine the relationships of dietary ecology and phylogeny to heterospecific aggression in a guild of corallivorous reef fishes. We find that, among chaetodontids (butterflyfishes), heterospecific aggression depends on a synergistic interaction of dietary overlap and specialization: aggression increases with dietary overlap for interactions between specialists but not for interactions involving generalists. Moreover, behavioral dominance is a monotonically increasing function of dietary specialization. The strong, positive relationship of dominance to specialization suggests that heterospecific aggression may contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity where it promotes resource partitioning. Additionally, we find strong phylogenetic signals in dietary overlap and specialization but not behavioral dominance. Our results support the use of phylogeny as a proxy for ecological similarity among butterflyfishes, but we find that direct measures of dietary overlap and specialization predict heterospecific agression much better than phylogeny.",W2025759680,True,0.9723261594772339

https://doi.org/10.1111/een.12790,Predator modulation of plant pathogen spread through induced changes in vector development rates,"1. Predation on vectors of pathogens can indirectly influence infection spread. In addition to the consumptive aspect of predation, non‐consumptive, predator‐induced changes in various vector traits can lead to trait‐mediated indirect effects on pathogen spread, potentially operating in various directions and magnitudes. 2. A widespread non‐consumptive effect of predation is the alteration of individual prey development rates. Yet, the implications of this phenomenon for the spread of vector‐borne plant pathogens have not been studied. It is hypothesized that the epidemiological effects of predator‐induced changes in vector development rate depend on the pattern in which the transmission biology of the vector changes along its ontogeny. 3. A general epidemiological model was developed that considers the role of predation in the infection dynamics of a plant pathogen, while incorporating vector stage structure to allow for variation in its development rate. 4. By contrasting scenarios that represent typical plant disease systems, this study confirms that the magnitude of the effect of altered development rate on infection prevalence depends on the disparity between juvenile and adult vectors in their pathogen transmission potential. 5. The model also reveals that the effect of predator‐induced change in development rate can impact pathogen spread counterintuitively. Specifically, slowing down vector development can result in increased pathogen prevalence due to apparent competition between infected and uninfected vector populations. 6. More detailed, stage‐specific studies of non‐consumptive predator effects on vectors are likely to advance our understanding of plant disease ecology, and the development of more effective biological control practices in agriculture.",W2966196658,True,0.9269297122955322
https://doi.org/10.3390/f10080609,Interactions between Climate and Nutrient Cycles on Forest Response to Global Change: The Role of Mixed Forests,"Forest ecosystems are undergoing unprecedented changes in environmental conditions due to global change impacts. Modification of global biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen, and the subsequent climate change are affecting forest functions at different scales, from physiology and growth of individual trees to cycling of nutrients. This review summarizes the present knowledge regarding the impact of global change on forest functioning not only with respect to climate change, which is the focus of most studies, but also the influence of altered nitrogen cycle and the interactions among them. The carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization effect on tree growth is expected to be constrained by nutrient imbalances resulting from high N deposition rates and the counteractive effect of increasing water deficit, which interact in a complex way. At the community level, responses to global change are modified by species interactions that may lead to competition for resources and/or relaxation due to facilitation and resource partitioning processes. Thus, some species mixtures can be more resistant to drought than their respective pure forests, albeit it depends on environmental conditions and species’ functional traits. Climate change and nitrogen deposition have additional impacts on litterfall dynamics, and subsequent decomposition and nutrient mineralization processes. Elemental ratios (i.e., stoichiometry) are associated with important ecosystem traits, including trees’ adaptability to stress or decomposition rates. As stoichiometry of different ecosystem components are also influenced by global change, nutrient cycling in forests will be altered too. Therefore, a re-assessment of traditional forest management is needed in order to cope with global change. Proposed silvicultural systems emphasize the key role of diversity to assure multiple ecosystem services, and special attention has been paid to mixed-species forests. Finally, a summary of the patterns and underlying mechanisms governing the relationships between diversity and different ecosystems functions, such as productivity and stability, is provided.",W2964016571,True,0.9539828896522522
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13018,Intransitivity increases plant functional diversity by limiting dominance in drylands worldwide,"Abstract Biotic interactions are key determinants of plant community structure. Indirect interactions such as intransitivity (i.e., the absence of competitive hierarchies among species) have been hypothesized to benefit diversity within plant communities. However, their effect on functional diversity remains scarcely explored in real communities. Here, we develop a novel approach to infer intransitivity from plant spatial patterns and functional traits (height and specific leaf area) and quantify its effect on different components of plant diversity along environmental gradients in 100 drylands from all continents except Antarctica. We first calculated the spatial association pattern for all perennials to infer competition between species. Trait values were used as a proxy of competitive hierarchies to infer the direction of these interactions. We used multiple regression models to evaluate how intransitivity responds to environmental variables (mean annual temperature and precipitation, precipitation seasonality, soil pH, sand content and woody cover). We also used confirmatory path analysis to evaluate the effects of intransitivity on species richness and evenness, trait dispersion and functional diversity. Intransitivity mostly responded to climatic variables and significantly increased with precipitation scarcity and seasonality. We found that intransitivity had significant effects on functional diversity, mostly by promoting plant community evenness. However, the dominance of woody vegetation (steppes versus shrublands) modulated this effect. Synthesis. Intransitivity increased the functional diversity of drylands, particularly under high rainfall seasonality, by limiting functionally dominant species. Our findings specify how intransitivity structures the functional diversity of dryland vegetation worldwide. Intransitivity may be particularly important in ecosystems where the availability of abiotic resources changes over time, thereby breaking down inherent competitive hierarchies between plant species. Neglecting intransitivity will bias our estimation of the impacts of biotic interactions on plant communities, a fundamental issue to fully understand how plant communities will respond to ongoing environmental changes.",W2808130368,True,0.9536451101303101

There were no significant temporal peaks in the number of adult males or amplexed females observed along an 81-m transect of a small creek throughout a 3-mo study period. The nightly sex ratio was highly male biased. Over the study period, the distribution pattern of males showed a significant tendency toward clumping at oviposition sites (represented as oviposition sections of the creek where females laid eggs). During the nights, males usually showed a nonclumped distribution pattern along the transect, probably due to male-male interactions mediated through vocalization and physical combat, including vigorous biting. The calling sites of males were considered as breeding territories and sites of oviposition. Larger males often changed their nightly position along the transect, whereas smaller males remained at the same sites over the study period. The number of different oviposition sections in which each male was present over the study period ranged from 0–11 and was positively correlated with male body size. The number of matings by each male ranged from 0–9, and 42% of the males mated at least once. Male mating success was positively correlated with six male traits that included body size and the number of nights present. However, multivariate analysis revealed that a direct factor determining male mating success was the number of different oviposition sites which a male visited. This study also demonstrated that large-male mating advantage in L. kuhlii occurred indirectly through the size-dependent spatial movement pattern. A large body size in male L. kuhlii seems to have evolved through intrasexual selection (male-male competition by physical combat) in the context of a resource-defense polygyny mating system.",W2042869304,True,0.9957159161567688
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-4571.2010.00155.x,"Evolutionary change in agriculture: the past, present and future","In this special issue of Evolutionary Applications, we draw together a series of diverse studies that provide a sample of some of the ways in which evolution driven by both conscious and unconscious selection by humans has shaped the development of modern agriculture. Agriculture has been a crucible of evolutionary change ever since its inception thousands of years ago, and this change permeates agricultural endeavours at all levels of biological organisation, ranging from the individual gene through to whole communities. Agro-ecosystems thus provide one of the most cogent examples of situations where anthropogenic effects are major determinants of biotic interactions within and among species and communities, suggesting a central role for the application of evolutionary principles. This is particularly the case, given global concerns regarding food production and food security, and increasingly, the expectation that agricultural productivity gains must be achieved with greater efficiencies, and reduced environmental impact. In the development of human society, the shift to a relatively settled way of life from a nomadic hunter-gatherer life-style was enormously profound, and made possible only by the development and adoption of early agricultural practices. In turn, this change in human life-style had major impacts on the environment of agriculture and hence the traits and characteristics of plants and animals that were favoured both consciously and unconsciously by humans. Very often traits suited to species growing without human protection/husbandry were not suitable for agriculture and were rapidly lost (e.g. seed shattering), while others were specifically favoured by the more protected environment agriculture provided, and increased in frequency (e.g. seed retention). As agriculture developed, the environment of the field and paddock became increasingly differentiated from that of the natural environments in which plants and animals originally evolved. For plants, nutrient availability generally rose, plant density and genetic uniformity increased, and the balance in competition shifted from inter-specific considerations to intra-specific ones (particularly with the general reduction in species diversity). Tilling and crop rotation were further agronomic practices that were introduced partly for fertility reasons but also for control of natural enemies, as rotation causes shifts in whole fungal pathogen communities. It is interesting to note that another generation of changes to tilling practices – minimum tillage – is to some extent now altering ecological and evolutionary interactions at the plant–soil interface towards a different set of fungal control issues. Similarly for animals, domestication created a more predictable environment with increased resource availability during harsh times and protection from predators, but increased threats from contagious diseases, all subtly influencing the evolutionary make-up of our livestock. Over the last few thousand years, domestication, selection and hybridisation, both unconscious and conscious, has also led to significant changes in the appearance of plants and animals and their nutritional value. Examples are seen in virtually all plant and animal species that are farmed. In horticulture, this diversity is often highly prized in the form of different varieties that are preserved for subtle variations in flavour, texture or simply appearance (e.g. in potato, tomato, apple). In a similar way, extensive selection in farmyard fowls (chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys), and in pigs, sheep and cattle have given rise to very many distinctive breeds that differ in milk production, flesh texture and flavour, and obvious appearance, as well as in less obvious traits, such as patterns of social behaviour. Extensive agriculture has also seen similar major changes that have resulted in significant increases in yield and productivity. In plants, perhaps one of the most dramatic changes to have occurred within a species is found in the emergence of modern high-yielding hybrid maize from its close relative teosinte, and the subsequent application of a number of induced mutations and the introduction of an F1 hybrid system. Similarly dramatic changes have occurred in meat and fibre production and quality in selected beef and sheep varieties respectively. In essence, throughout the history of agriculture, changes in agronomic and animal husbandry practices and in the crops and animals being farmed have had collateral effects that have changed the balance and intensity of different selective forces. This has been particularly apparent in plants where increasing nutrient status (particularly nitrogen) generally favours the growth and development of insect and fungal pests – the numbers of which are frequently then further exacerbated by increased plant density (this increases humidity and thus conditions for fungal spore germination; and reduces inoculum loss during transmission) and genetic uniformity of crops. As selection by humans shifted to a conscious understanding of genetics, the focus also increasingly centred on accumulating single major gene traits because these could be more readily manipulated. While human selection has been a major driving force in the types of changes outlined above, subject to the vagaries of fashion, it has often tended to be highly directional favouring more and more extreme manifestations of the traits in question. In the realm of biotic interactions involving pests and pathogens, these approaches have often precipitated the equivalent of an 'arms race' between humans and these natural enemies of their crops. Importantly, in contrast to many other evolutionary issues in agro-ecosystems, interactions between disease causing organisms and our crops and livestock are characterised by much more dynamic and unpredictable reciprocal evolutionary change. For example, during the 20th century, breeding for rust resistance in cereals through the deployment of single major genes for resistance, placed major selection pressure on relevant pathogen populations leading to the rapid emergence of new pathotypes with novel pathogenicity profiles capable of overcoming the recently deployed resistance. Indeed, this reciprocal process became so rapid and predictable that it became known as 'man-guided evolution of the rusts' (Johnson 1961). Clearly then, developments in our understanding of evolution and genetics have had unintended effects as well as having a huge impact on the process of conscious plant and animal improvement. In recent decades, technological advances, particularly in molecular biology, have further accelerated this process. Traditionally in the context of agricultural breeding, to understand relationships between domesticated species we look to the concept of the gene pool to understand the closeness of relationship between any two species and the potential for utilising and combining desirable traits. Those in the primary (landraces and immediate wild progenitors) and secondary (closely related species) gene pools, because of their sexual compatibility have been used for some time as sources of beneficial traits. However, until the dawn of the molecular revolution, access to valuable traits in the tertiary gene pool (more distantly related species) was exceptionally difficult while access to the quadranary gene pool (organisms from other kingdoms) was impossible. As noted above, the process of domestication is one of the most obvious ways in which human-driven selection has driven evolution in agriculture. The article by Moyle and Muir (2010) provides a fascinating overview of research on tomato and its wild relatives, in particular highlighting how such studies can provide insight into the mechanisms underlying traits of functional importance (e.g. adaptation to water stress). These studies also exemplify the genetic trade-offs that constrain high yield to a narrow set of environments. O'Neill et al. (2010) illustrates these trade-offs within a summary of the evolutionary history of Bos taurus cattle, as adaptation to stress-free temperate conditions generated breeds with little resistance to diseases common in tropical regions. They advocate explicit consideration of genotype × environment × management interactions in future breeding efforts. Such approaches may be critical to future livestock systems which must increasingly meet the twin goals of economic and environmental sustainability. A similar story is told within the article by Van Tassel et al. (2010), which describes how man-guided adaptation of plants to crop field situations has favoured shorter-lived species with unusually high allocations to sexual reproduction. Given the high environmental costs of this mode of production, these authors argue that there is a need and growing promise in the development of useful perennial plants for agriculture. Traits that differentially affect group versus individual fitness have particular importance in agricultural production where domesticated plant and animal populations are generally grown at high densities. Aggressive behaviour in chickens and pigs, for example, can be individually advantageous, but result in reduced yield overall. Wade et al. (2010) present a theoretical framework for and evidence of successful efforts to use the principles of group selection to evolve less aggressive domesticated pigs and chickens with positive effects on farm yield. Similar conflicts between individual and group yield mediate production in cropping systems and two examples of these are presented by Denison et al. (2010) and Weiner et al. (2010) who focus on complementary aspects of competition for light in agricultural fields. Focusing on maize as an example, Mercer and Perales (2010) explores the issue of crop genetic resources as maintained in landraces, the evolutionary potential for crop adaptation to changing climates, and some of the problems associated with ex situ conservation of crop genetic resources. Crop weeds have direct economic impacts on productivity, but are also of evolutionary interest in several contexts (e.g. herbicide resistance, shifts in weed life history, cross-species gene transfer), particularly given that they demonstrate many of the ecological characteristics of crop species. A comparative analysis of weedy species that have evolved from domesticated plants suggests that useful insights can be gained with regard to traits that correlate with invasiveness (Ellstrand et al. 2010). Despite the generally simpler communities represented by agro-ecosystems relative to natural plant and animal communities, strong interspecific interactions still constrain yield and influence man directed and unconscious evolution in agro-ecosystems. Principal among these interactions are the pathogens (Burdon and Thrall 2008), with the source of individual pathogen populations being a persistent question. Wang et al. (2010) integrate molecular, experimental and field studies to demonstrate that Fusarium wilt disease of cotton in Australia has most likely evolved locally from related fungal strains associated with native cotton hosts. The negative effect of pathogens and other natural enemies can be ameliorated through crop interactions with other symbionts, including endophytic fungi, though these fungi can themselves carry a yield penalty. Alternative frameworks for understanding conditions in which endophytic fungi improve yield are developed by Saunders et al. (2010) and Gundel et al. (2010). While Saunders and colleagues focus on determinants of endophyte dynamics such as order of colonisation, Gundel et al. (2010) examine patterns of plant breeding system and plant-endophyte compatibility. Plant yield is also determined by interactions with soil micro-organisms and while there is increasing recognition of the role of soil biota as drivers of ecosystem function and productivity, there is still relatively little knowledge of how agronomic management practices (e.g. crop rotation, tilling practices, fertiliser applications) might impact on soil communities. Verbruggen and Kiers (2010) address this by focussing on agronomic management practices that influence underlying evolutionary forces that determine the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in farming systems, and how management might be shifted to enhance the benefits provided by these mutualisms. Over the past decade, research into, and the deployment of GM technologies has increased rapidly, particularly in the developing world. Concomitant decreases in the costs of developing and implementing such approaches, together with advances in our technical ability to insert or modify specific genes or gene pathways will further contribute to shifts towards the use of these approaches. GM technologies provide one of the few examples where evolutionary principles (pyramiding of genes, crop refuges) have been explicitly applied in a pre-emptive fashion to minimise risks (another is seen in the use of varietal mixtures for disease control in cereals). In this issue, we highlight this topic with two papers which focus on management strategies aimed at delaying the evolution of resistance to Bt toxins in transgenic crops such as maize and cotton. Carriere et al. (2010) provide an excellent overview of the success of these approaches over the past 15 years; they conclude that, while refuges have been generally successful, better understanding of source-sink dynamics and improved ability to manipulate resistance costs in pest species may be important avenues for future research. Downes et al. (2010) examine the specific case of Bt cotton in Australia, where it has been widely deployed, and where Bt resistance has been explicitly and successfully managed since the initial release of transgenic cotton. The studies presented here represent only a fraction of the diversity of evolutionary issues of relevance to agro-ecosystems. With regard to human-driven selection of yield-associated traits in crops there are many other issues associated with changes in plant structure and architecture, genome duplication during domestication, and life history traits such as flowering time; tillering rates etc. that have practical significance. While articles in this issue highlight some research on species interactions in agriculture, overall the evolutionary potential of feedbacks across the agro-ecological interface is under-studied, particularly given likely changes in agricultural land-use (diversification, intensification, increased area under production, greater use of GM technologies). Such feedbacks include increased pest and herbicide resistance, pathogen evolution, weediness, and more generally the consequences of durable pest control (e.g. opportunities for previously minor pathogens/pests to emerge). In at least one case (Bt resistance in crop pests), there has been explicit development of management approaches based on evolutionary principles. New opportunities for evolutionary analysis also arise from recent advances in our ability to quickly characterise patterns of soil biodiversity (e.g. next generation DNA sequencing, microarrays) at multiple spatial scales and with rigorous replication – the necessary foundation for exposing the cryptic genetic variation that underpins soil community function. Agriculture is thus the source of diverse selective forces, and modern agriculture – its species and practices, is the outcome of a continuous process of change that has dramatically changed physically and genetically all components of agro-ecosystems. Further advances in the genetic potential of crops and livestock will continue to be dominated by conventional breeding strategies made increasingly efficient by advances in marker technologies. In addition though, the introduction of genes from other species via molecular manipulation (GM technologies) will become increasingly common but generally restricted to introducing changes that are unattainable via conventional approaches. Overall therefore, recognition and application of ecological and evolutionary principles will be an increasingly important part of the overall development and management of agriculture, particularly in the context of climate change (new plants and animals), and the imperative for greater sustainability (shifts in land management). As such, we suggest that biologists might do well to consider agro-ecosystems as useful models for the scientific investigation of evolutionary processes.",W1904980088,True,0.9705058336257935

In particular, the effects of multiple fish predators on food webs are difficult to predict due to the prevalence of omnivory and intraguild predation. At the same time, many ecosystems experience high nutrient loads that fuel food webs from the bottom up. To test the combined effects of both multiple predators and nutrient enrichment on food web composition, we created monocultures of perch, roach, and stickleback as well as mixed assemblages of all 3 species at 3 different density levels using an additive design, and induced nutrient enrichment in half of the cages. The biomass of invertebrate herbivores and algae was measured. Stomach analyses of predators were used to detect prey switching. Herbivore biomass depended mainly on predator identity, while top-down effects on algae were mediated by predator density and nutrient enrichment. Specifically, perch strongly reduced amphipods and isopods, and roach mainly reduced gastropods but also isopods, while stickleback had weak overall effects on herbivores. These species-specific effects were attenuated in the mixed fish assemblages, probably due to prey switching. Algal growth strongly increased under high fish density and nutrient enrichment, but was not affected by predator-induced changes in the herbivore composition. This study shows that identity effects from predators in isolation are attenuated in multiple predator assemblages, probably due to increasing interference among the predators. Algal biomass was enhanced by nutrient enrichment and high predator density, which affected algae probably through non-lethal effects, such as reduced activity of the herbivores.

https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.03165,Resource levels and prey state influence antipredator behavior and the strength of nonconsumptive predator effects,"The risk of predation can drive trophic cascades by causing prey to engage in antipredator behavior (e.g. reduced feeding), but these behaviors can be energetically costly for prey. The effects of predation risk on prey (nonconsumptive effects, NCEs) and emergent indirect effects on basal resources should therefore depend on the ecological context (e.g. resource abundance, prey state) in which prey manage growth/predation risk tradeoffs. Despite an abundance of behavioral research and theory examining state‐dependent responses to risk, there is a lack of empirical data on state‐dependent NCEs and their impact on community‐level processes. We used a rocky intertidal food chain to test model predictions for how resources levels and prey state (age/size) shape the magnitude of NCEs. Risk cues from predatory crabs Carcinus maenas caused juvenile and sub‐adult snails Nucella lapillus to increase their use of refuge habitats and decrease their growth and per capita foraging rates on barnacles Semibalanus balanoides. Increasing resource levels (high barnacle density) and prey state (sub‐adults) enhanced the strength of NCEs. Our results support predictions that NCEs will be stronger in resource‐rich systems that enhance prey state and suggest that the demographic composition of prey populations will influence the role of NCEs in trophic cascades. Contrary to theory, however, we found that resources and prey state had little to no effect on snails in the presence of predation risk. Rather, increases in NCE strength arose because of the strong positive effects of resources and prey state on prey foraging rates in the absence of risk. Hence, a common approach to estimating NCE strength – integrating measurements of prey traits with and without predation risk into a single metric – may mask the underlying mechanisms driving variation in the strength and relative importance of NCEs in ecological communities.",W2270179032,True,0.9482868313789368
https://doi.org/10.1890/09-1912.1,Swimming performance trade-offs across a gradient in community composition in Trinidadian killifish (Rivulus hartii),"The impacts of predation and competition on life history, behavioral, and morphological traits are well established for many organisms, but effects on locomotor performance have received relatively little attention. We examined variation in sprint speed and critical swimming speed (Ucrit, a measure of stamina) in the Trinidadian killifish (Rivulus hartii) across a gradient of ecological communities. R. hartii are located in (1) ""high-predation"" sites with large, piscine piscivores, (2) ""Rivulus–guppy"" sites with guppies, and (3) ""Rivulus-only"" sites with only R. hartii. R. hartii suffer higher mortality in high-predation sites. In Rivulus–guppy sites, population densities are reduced and growth rates increased compared with Rivulus-only sites, which likely represent indirect effects of guppy predation on young R. hartii. We show a significant negative relationship, suggesting a trade-off, between sprint speed and endurance; Rivulus from high-predation sites were faster sprinters but had reduced critical swimming speeds. This trade-off was also apparent in correlations of the nine population means. At the individual level, the correlation was weaker and only significantly negative when all nine populations (three from each site) were pooled and values were not corrected for body size. Sex had a significant effect on Ucrit, with females having a lower Ucrit, but sexes did not differ in sprint speed. Fish from high-predation sites also exhibited increased tail lengths and fineness ratios compared to sites without large predators. The two low-predation sites showed no statistical differences in locomotor performance or morphology.",W2067819937,True,0.989909291267395

Resource availability can influence the structure of animal communities by mediating competitive interactions. An underappreciated aspect of resource ecology is how functional traits are built from particular sets of nutrients and thus are underexpressed when those nutrients are scarce. 2. One idea linking resource availability to competition is the metabolic fuel hypothesis, which posits that access to carbohydrate‐rich resources favours high activity rates that increase competitive prowess. One prediction of this hypothesis is that an increase in dietary carbohydrate richness will lead to an increase in consumer metabolic rate (MR). An alternative prediction is that carbohydrate‐rich diets will affect biochemical storage. 3. We tested these predictions by examining the effect of dietary protein : carbohydrate (P : C) ratio on the feeding behaviour, demography, physiology and MR of colonies of Ectatomma ruidum, a common tropical ant. We found that rearing colonies for 6 weeks on different P : C diets altered colony demography and worker storage biochemistry, but higher carbohydrate intake did not result in an increase in whole‐colony MR. 4. Our results suggest that dietary carbohydrates may increase colony dominance through changes in colony composition and individual worker longevity rather than changes in worker activity rates. More generally, they illustrate how the identity of scarce nutrients can have particular effects on traits that impact ecological interactions.",W1691639883,True,0.9916525483131409
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029487,Selection against Accumulating Mutations in Niche-Preference Genes Can Drive Speciation,"Our current understanding of sympatric speciation is that it occurs primarily through disruptive selection on ecological genes driven by competition, followed by reproductive isolation through reinforcement-like selection against inferior intermediates/heterozygotes. Our evolutionary model of selection on resource recognition and preference traits suggests a new mechanism for sympatric speciation. We find speciation can occur in three phases. First a polymorphism of functionally different phenotypes is established through evolution of specialization. On the gene level, regulatory functions have evolved in which some alleles are conditionally switched off (i.e. are silent). These alleles accumulate harmful mutations that potentially may be expressed in offspring through recombination. Second mating associated with resource preference invades because harmful mutations in parents are not expressed in the offspring when mating assortatively, thereby dividing the population into two pre-zygotically isolated resource-specialist lineages. Third, silent alleles that evolved in phase one now accumulate deleterious mutations over the following generations in a Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller fashion, establishing a post-zygotic barrier to hybridization.",W2115242058,True,0.9805545210838318
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0055100,Restricting Prey Dispersal Can Overestimate the Importance of Predation in Trophic Cascades,"Predators can affect prey populations and, via trophic cascades, predators can indirectly impact resource populations (2 trophic levels below the predator) through consumption of prey (density-mediated indirect effects; DMIEs) and by inducing predator-avoidance behavior in prey (trait-mediated indirect effects; TMIEs). Prey often employ multiple predator-avoidance behaviors, such as dispersal or reduced foraging activity, but estimates of TMIEs are usually on individual behaviors. We assessed direct and indirect predator effects in a mesocosm experiment using a marine food chain consisting of a predator (toadfish--Opsanus tau), prey (mud crab--Panopeus herbstii) and resource (ribbed musse--Geukensia demissa). We measured dispersal and foraging activity of prey separately by manipulating both the presence and absence of the predator, and whether prey could or could not disperse into a predator-free area. Consumption of prey was 9 times greater when prey could not disperse, probably because mesocosm boundaries increased predator capture success. Although predator presence did not significantly affect the number of crabs that emigrated, the presence of a predator decreased resource consumption by prey, which resulted in fewer resources consumed for each prey that emigrated in the presence of a predator, and reduced the overall TMIE. When prey were unable to disperse, TMIEs on mussel survival were 3 times higher than the DMIEs. When prey were allowed to disperse, the TMIEs on resource survival increased to 11-times the DMIEs. We found that restricting the ability of prey to disperse, or focusing on only one predator-avoidance behavior, may be underestimating TMIEs. Our results indicate that the relative contribution of behavior and consumption in food chain dynamics will depend on which predator-avoidance behaviors are allowed to occur and measured.",W2035447577,True,0.9694312810897827
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13935,Some neighbours are better than others: Variation in associational effects among plants in an old field community,"Abstract Consumer‐resource interactions are often influenced by other species in the community, such as when neighbouring plants increase or reduce herbivory to a focal plant species (known as associational effects). The many studies on associational effects between a focal plant and some neighbour have shown that these effects can vary greatly in strength and direction. But because almost all of these studies measure associational effects from only one or two neighbour species, we know little about the actual range of associational effects that a plant species might encounter in a natural setting. This makes it difficult to determine how important effects of neighbours are in real field settings, and how associational effects might interact with competition and other processes to influence plant community composition. In this study, we used a field experiment with a focal species, Solanum carolinense, and 11 common neighbour species to investigate how associational effects vary among many co‐occurring neighbour species and to test whether factors such as neighbour plant apparency, phylogenetic proximity to the focal species, or effects on focal plant defence traits help to explain interspecific variation in associational effect strength. We found that some neighbour species affected S. carolinense damage and attack by specialist herbivores, but associational effects of most neighbours were weak. Associational effects increased herbivore attack on average earlier in the season (associational susceptibility) and reduced herbivore attack on average later in the season (associational resistance) relative to S. carolinense in monoculture. We found some evidence that a neighbour's associational effect was related to its biomass and phylogenetic proximity to the focal species. While neighbour species differed in their effects on physical leaf traits of focal plants (trichome density, specific leaf area, and leaf toughness), these traits did not appear to mediate the effects of neighbours on focal plant herbivory. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the distribution of associational effect strengths in natural communities are similar to those observed for other interaction types, and that multiple mechanisms are likely acting simultaneously to shape associational effects of different neighbour species.",W4281624773,True,0.9498330354690552

This study aims to understand the functional diversity of tree reproductive traits of sacred forest patches in an altered landscape. Twenty-five sacred groves in Palakkad region, Kerala, India, were chosen to assess the distribution of five reproductive traits – pollination mechanism, fruit size, seed number, seed size and dispersal mechanism – among the tree populations. The data matrix was analysed for overall trait-state distribution, functional diversity assessment and its relation to environmental parameters and disturbance in the area. A total of 87 woody species was documented with a fairly homogenized distribution of fruit and seed characters, with ≥50% of the recorded trait states in each grove in comparison to control plot. Pollination and dispersal mechanisms are dominated by a single guild. e.g. insects and birds, often generalist in nature. Functional richness had a strong correlation with Shannon's index and disturbance, but evenness and divergence were weakly related with others. Comparative assessment with null model showed no significant deviations from expected results indicating apparent lack of habitat filtering or resource competition among sacred groves. The trait homogenization and overall simplification of the grove biota is perhaps an outcome of rapid land-use change and its consequences on specialist members. This study shows sacred groves are important for maintaining a plethora of functional traits in the altered landscape. However, the prevalence of generalist mediators indicates maintenance of basic ecological functions in the landscape without support for specialist ones.",W2774492164,True,0.9749610424041748

However, the variability of these particles and of the environmental conditions surrounding them present a challenge to the study of the ecological processes shaping particle-associated communities and their function. In this work, we utilize data from experiments in which coastal water communities are grown on synthetic particles to ask which are the most important ecological drivers of their assembly and associated traits. Combining 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing with shotgun metagenomics, together with an analysis of the full genomes of a subset of isolated strains, we were able to identify two-to-three distinct community classes, corresponding to early vs. late colonizers. We show that these classes are shaped by environmental selection (early colonizers) and facilitation (late colonizers) and find distinctive traits associated with each class. While early colonizers have a larger proportion of genes related to the uptake of nutrients, motility, and environmental sensing with few pathways enriched for metabolism, late colonizers devote a higher proportion of genes for metabolism, comprising a wide array of different pathways including the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and xenobiotics. Analysis of selected pathways suggests the existence of a trophic-chain topology connecting both classes for nitrogen metabolism, potential exchange of branched chain amino acids for late colonizers, and differences in bacterial doubling times throughout the succession. The interpretation of these traits suggests a distinction between early and late colonizers analogous to other classifications found in the literature, and we discuss connections with the classical distinction between r- and K-strategists.",W4283328605,True,0.9784161448478699
https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.03157,Associational resistance or susceptibility: the indirect interaction between chemically‐defended and non‐defended herbivore prey via a shared predator,"Many organisms possess chemical defences against their natural enemies, which render them unpalatable or toxic when attacked or consumed. These chemically‐defended organisms commonly occur in communities with non‐ or less‐defended prey, leading to indirect interactions between prey species, mediated by natural enemies. Although the importance of enemy‐mediated indirect interactions have been well documented (e.g. apparent competition), how the presence of prey chemical defences may affect predation of non‐defended prey in terrestrial communities remains unclear. Here, an experimental approach was used to study the predator‐mediated indirect interaction between a chemically‐defended and non‐defended pest aphid species. Using laboratory‐based mesocosms, aphid community composition was manipulated to include chemically‐defended (CD) aphids Brevicoryne brassicae, non‐defended (ND) aphids Myzus persicae or a mixed assemblage of both species, on Brassica oleracea cabbage plants, in the presence or absence of a shared predator ( Chrysoperla carnea larvae). Aphid population growth rates, aphid distributions on host plants and predator growth rates were measured. In single‐species treatments, C. carnea reduced M. persicae population growth rate, but had no significant impact on B. brassicae population growth rate, suggesting B. brassicae chemical defences are effective against C. carnea. Chrysoperla carnea had no significant impact on either aphid species population growth rate in mixed‐species treatments. Myzus persicae (ND) therefore experienced reduced predation in the presence of B. brassicae (CD) through a predator‐mediated indirect effect. Moreover, predator growth rates were significantly higher in the M. persicae‐ only treatments than in either the B. brassicae‐ only or mixed‐species treatments, suggesting predation was impaired in the presence of B. brassicae (CD). A trait‐mediated indirect interaction is proposed, consistent with associational resistance, in which the predator, upon incidental consumption of chemically‐defended aphids is deterred from feeding, releasing non‐defended aphids from predatory control.",W2339739142,True,0.9562711715698242
https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2007.1713,CD4 <sup>+</sup> T cells do not mediate within-host competition between genetically diverse malaria parasites,"Ecological interactions between microparasite populations in the same host are an important source of selection on pathogen traits such as virulence and drug resistance. In the rodent malaria model Plasmodium chabaudi in laboratory mice, parasites that are more virulent can competitively suppress less virulent parasites in mixed infections. There is evidence that some of this suppression is due to immune-mediated apparent competition, where an immune response elicited by one parasite population suppress the population density of another. This raises the question whether enhanced immunity following vaccination would intensify competitive interactions, thus strengthening selection for virulence in Plasmodium populations. Using the P. chabaudi model, we studied mixed infections of virulent and avirulent genotypes in CD4 + T cell-depleted mice. Enhanced efficacy of CD4 + T cell-dependent responses is the aim of several candidate malaria vaccines. We hypothesized that if immune-mediated interactions were involved in competition, removal of the CD4 + T cells would alleviate competitive suppression of the avirulent parasite. Instead, we found no alleviation of competition in the acute phase, and significant enhancement of competitive suppression after parasite densities had peaked. Thus, the host immune response may actually be alleviating other forms of competition, such as that over red blood cells. Our results suggest that the CD4 + -dependent immune response, and mechanisms that act to enhance it such as vaccination, may not have the undesirable affect of exacerbating within-host competition and hence the strength of this source of selection for virulence.",W1985950787,True,0.9928321838378906

We tested the role of behaviour in resource use divergence of two Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) phenotypes, a slim, putatively pelagic-dwelling morph and a robust, putatively littoral-dwelling generalist morph, over an annual cycle, using biotelemetry and stable isotopes. Pelagic morph charr exhibited significantly greater δC(13) depletion, concordant with increased zooplanktivory, than for the Littoral morph. Although three-dimensional space-use of the morphs strongly overlapped, on average, the Littoral morph used that habitat 19.3% more than the Pelagic morph. Pelagic morph fish were significantly more active, further from the lake bed and at greater depth than Littoral fish (annual means respectively, Pelagic, 0.069 BL s(-1), 8.21 m and 14.11 m; Littoral, 0.047 BL s(-1), 5.87 m and 10.47 m). Patterns of habitat use differed between ecomorphs at key times, such as during autumn and at ice break, likely related to spawning and resumption of intensive foraging respectively. Extensive space-use overlap, but fine-scale differences in habitat use between charr ecomorphs, suggests the importance of competition for generating and maintaining polymorphism, and its potential for promoting reproductive isolation and evolution in sympatry.",W2341967576,True,0.988627552986145

In this review, we synthesize how the assembly and life-history composition of soil microbial communities influence the production of necromass and by-products that become SOM. Since SOM is the repository for SOC, we primarily discuss SOM but address SOM and SOC throughout. Recent insights into SOM chemistry via spectroscopy and microbial assembly via molecular analyses—much of which are context specific—have not been well integrated. We argue that it is essential to better merge these areas of research in order to guide cohesive development in SOC research. At a time of unprecedented global change, it is critical to have a solid conceptual basis upon which we can predict SOC responses to different global change scenarios. Fundamentally, microbial SOM formation is an outcome of microbial growth, which is frequently represented by growth rate and efficiency. Whole soil growth efficiency is primarily modeled as the proportion of C that is incorporated into biomass versus respiration (i.e., C use efficiency), with this value ranging between <0.1 and >0.9 for individual organisms and typically between 0.25 and 0.8 for whole communities depending on community structure, substrate type, and environmental conditions.25Manzoni S.

Individual traits should mediate the effect of resources, yielding a complex condition-dependent dispersal response. We investigated how experimental food reductions in a food-rich environment around poultry-growing villages interact with individual-traits (age, gender, body-mass) in two sympatric canids, red foxes and golden jackals, to jointly affect emigration propensity and survival during dispersal. Sub-adult foxes emigrated more frequently from the food-rich habitat than from the pristine, food-limited habitat, while adult foxes showed the opposite trend. During dispersal, adults exhibited lower survival while sub-adults did not experience additional mortality costs. Although fox mortality rates increased in response to food reduction, dispersal remained unchanged, while jackals showed strong dispersal response in two of the three repetitions. Jackal survival under food reduction was lowest for the dispersing individuals. While resources are an important dispersal determinant, different age classes and species experience the same resource environment differently and consequently have different motivations, yielding different dispersal responses and consequences.",W2316097479,True,0.9859412908554077

RCA ‐silenced plants are impaired not only in photosynthetic capacity and growth, but also in jasmonic acid‐isoleucine ( JA ‐Ile) signaling, and herbivore resistance mediated by JA ‐Ile‐dependent defense traits. These responses are consistent with a resource‐based growth–defense trade‐off. As JA + Ile supplementation of OS restored wild‐type ( WT ) levels of JA ‐Ile, defenses and resistance to M. sexta, but OS supplemented individually with JA or Ile did not, the JA ‐Ile deficiency of RCA ‐silenced plants could not be attributed to lower JA or Ile pools or JAR 4/6 conjugating activity. Similar levels of JA ‐Ile derivatives after OS elicitation indicated unaltered JA ‐Ile turnover, and lower levels of other JA conjugates ruled out competition from other conjugation reactions. RCA ‐silenced plants accumulated more methyl jasmonate (Me JA ) after OS elicitation, which corresponded to increased jasmonate methyltransferase ( JMT ) activity. RCA silencing phenocopies JMT overexpression, wherein elevated JMT activity redirects OS ‐elicited JA flux towards inactive Me JA, creating a JA sink which depletes JA ‐Ile and its associated defense responses. Hence, RCA plays an additional non‐photosynthetic role in attenuating JA ‐mediated defenses and their associated costs, potentially allowing plants to anticipate resource‐based constraints on growth before they actually occur.",W2141302740,True,0.9434421062469482

We assessed the influence of plant defense on aphid and coccinellid performance in laboratory trials with low- vs. high-glucosinolate varieties of Brassica napus, a dietary specialist (Brevicoryne brassicae) and generalist (Myzus persicae) aphid, and five species of aphidophagous coccinellids. The performance of the specialist and generalist aphids was similar and unaffected by variation in plant defense. Aphid glucosinolate concentration and resistance to predators differed by aphid species and host plant defense, and these effects acted independently. With respect to aphid species, the dietary generalist aphid (vs. specialist) had 14% lower glucosinolate concentration and coccinellid predators ate three-fold more aphids. With respect to host plant variety, the high-glucosinolate plants (vs. low) increased aphid glucosinolate concentration by 21%, but had relatively weak effects on predation by coccinellids and these effects varied among coccinellid species. In turn, coccinellid performance was influenced by the interactive effects of plant defense and aphid species, as the cascading, indirect effect of plant defense was greater when feeding upon the specialist than generalist aphid. When feeding upon specialist aphids, low- (vs. high-) glucosinolate plants increased coccinellid mass gain by 78% and accelerated development by 14%. In contrast, when feeding upon generalist aphids, low- (vs. high-) glucosinolate plants increased coccinellid mass gain by only 11% and had no detectable effect on development time. These interactive effects of plant defense and aphid diet breadth on predator performance also varied among coccinellid species; the indirect negative effects of plant defenses on predator performance was consistent among the five predators when transmitted via the dietary specialist aphid, but these effects varied substantially among predators—in both the magnitude and direction—when transmitted via the dietary generalist aphid. Accordingly, the cascading effect of plant defense on predators was stronger in magnitude and more consistent among predator taxa when transmitted by the specialist than generalist herbivore. Overall, these findings support a central role of herbivore diet breadth in mediating both the strength and contingency of tri-trophic interactions.",W2402954501,True,0.9020929932594299

Using two spatially explicit mating models that analyse the genotypes of seeds and seedlings, we investigated the variation of male and female fecundities within and among three European beech ( Fagus sylvatica ) stands situated along an altitudinal gradient. Female and male individual fecundity distributions were both skewed in this monoecious species, and we found a higher variance in female as compared to male fecundities. Both female and male fecundities increased with tree size and decreased with density and competition in the neighbourhood, the details of these effects suggesting sex‐specific strategies to deal with the impact of limited resource on fecundity. The studied populations were functionally male‐biased. Among‐individual variations in functional gender were not driven by tree size but by density and competition in the neighbourhood. Femaleness decreased under limited resource availability, an expected consequence of the higher cost of female reproduction. Considering the variation of gene flow and genetic drift across elevation, our results suggest that the adaptive potential could be enhanced by low genetic drift at low elevation, and by high pollen‐mediated gene flow at high elevation. Finally, this study predicts a more efficient response to selection for traits related to male vs. female fitness, for a given selection intensity.",W2841023601,True,0.973405659198761

These differences can result from interspecies competition leading to character shifts, a process referred to as character displacement. While character displacement is often interpreted as a consequence of genetically fixed trait differences between species, it can also be mediated by phenotypic plasticity in response to the presence of another species. Here, we test whether phenotypic plasticity leads to a shift in proteome allocation during co-occurrence of two bacterial species from the abundant, leaf-colonizing families Sphingomonadaceae and Rhizobiaceae in their natural habitat. Upon mono-colonizing of the phyllosphere, both species exhibit specific and shared protein functions indicating a niche overlap. During co-colonization, quantitative differences in the protein repertoire of both bacterial populations occur as a result of bacterial coexistence in planta. Specifically, the Sphingomonas strain produces enzymes for the metabolization of xylan, while the Rhizobium strain reprograms its metabolism to beta-oxidation of fatty acids fueled via the glyoxylate cycle and adapts its biotin acquisition. We demonstrate the conditional relevance of cross-species facilitation by mutagenesis leading to loss of fitness in competition in planta. Our results show that dynamic character displacement and niche facilitation mediated by phenotypic plasticity can contribute to species coexistence.",W4280488178,True,0.9482756853103638
https://doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.21995,Ecological Interactions Involving Feral Horses and Predators: Review with Implications for Biodiversity Conservation,"ABSTRACT For many ecosystems, feral horses are increasingly becoming an important if not dominant component of ungulate biomass and hence influence on community dynamics. Yet we still know little of how horses contribute to key ecological interactions including predator‐prey and indirect competitive relationships at a community level. Notably, feral species like horses can exhibit life‐history traits that differ from that of native (mainly artiodactyl) herbivore competitors. Artificial selection for traits like increased, early, or extended reproduction that have yet to be reversed by natural selection, coupled with naturally selected differences in anatomy and behavior, in addition to unique management objectives for horses compared to other species, means that the dynamics of feral horse populations are not likely to align with what might be expected of other large herbivores. Unexpected population dynamics and inherent biological asymmetries between native ungulates and feral horses may therefore influence the former via direct competition for shared resources and through enemy‐mediated interactions like apparent competition. In several localities feral horses now co‐exist with multiple native prey species, some of which are in decline or are species at risk. Compounding risks to native species from direct or indirect competitive exclusion by horses is the unique nature and socio‐political context of feral horse management, which tends towards allowing horse populations to be limited largely by natural, density‐dependent factors. We summarize the inherent asymmetries between feral horse biology and that of other ungulate prey species with consequences for conservation, focusing on predator‐prey and emerging indirect interactions in multi‐prey systems, and highlight future directions to address key knowledge gaps in our understanding of how feral horses may now be contributing to the (re)structuring of food webs. Observations of patterns of rapid growth and decline, and associated skews in sex ratios of feral horse populations, indicate a heightened potential for indirect interactions among large ungulate prey species, where there is a prevalence of feral horses as preferred prey, particularly where native prey are declining. In places like western North America, we expect predator‐prey interactions involving feral horses to become an increasingly important factor in the conservation of wildlife. This applies not only to economically or culturally important game species but also at‐risk species, both predators (e.g., wolves [ Canis lupus ], grizzly bears [ Ursus arctos ]) and prey (e.g., woodland caribou [ Rangifer tarandus caribou ]), necessitating an ecological understanding of the role of horses in natural environments that goes beyond that of population control. © 2021 The Wildlife Society.",W3129160062,True,0.9929233193397522

However, studies manipulating both the amount of maternal pre-hatching resources and the harshness of post-hatching environment have seldom been performed to date. In this experimental study of Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) nestlings, we tested the consequences of a reduction in the albumen content of the eggs for fitness-related offspring traits, while performing an unbalanced partial cross-fostering soon after hatching, either increasing or decreasing brood size by one nestling. By molecular sexing of the chicks, we additionally tested for sex-specific sensitivity of individual nestlings to experimental treatments and to sex ratio variation in nestmates. We predicted that chicks hatching from albumen-deprived eggs should suffer more than control chicks from the harsher rearing conditions of enlarged broods. However, although albumen removal depressed chick body mass, chicks hatching from control eggs did not fare better than those hatching from eggs with reduced albumen content in enlarged vs. reduced broods. Albumen removal had sex-specific effects on immunity, with males, but not females, hatching from eggs with reduced albumen content showing a lower T-cell-mediated immune response than controls, suggesting that the two sexes were differentially susceptible to resource deprivation during early ontogeny. In addition, both immune response and chick body mass at age 7 days, when maximum growth rate is attained, declined with an increasing proportion of male nestmates. The effect of brood size manipulation on chick body mass at age 12 days, when peak body mass is attained, was also found to depend on brood sex composition, in that an increase in the proportion of male nestmates depressed offspring body mass in reduced broods, while the reverse was true in enlarged broods. On the whole, these findings suggest that sex differences may exist in environmental sensitivity and patterns of resource allocation among different body functions, and that brood size variation and sex composition may affect offspring fitness-related traits.",W1970590127,True,0.9035586714744568
https://doi.org/10.1890/es15-00055.1,Color mimicry of empty seeds influences the probability of predation by birds,"Seeds are under strong pressure from seed predators. Therefore any physical seed trait increasing the chances of the seed's survival should undergo positive selection. Seed color polymorphism, varying from pale to dark seeds, occurs in Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris ), a keystone species of coniferous forests in Eurasia. This phenomenon can be explained by the production of large quantities of empty, always pale colored, seeds, with the opportunity for mimicry of these worthless seeds to avoid predation. Here, we investigated how the color of empty seeds may influence the foraging choices of the most common visual seed predator in temperate forests, the Chaffinch ( Fringilla coelebs ). We show, from field experiments, that different colored seed had different probabilities of predation by the chaffinch, and that predation was highest for dark seeds and lowest for pale empty seeds. Thus, the occurrence of empty seeds might benefit full seeds which mimic their coloration, even for those which are highly visible on the ground. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that mimicry by seeds of the color of the ground did not improve their survival but the production of pale full seeds resembling empty seeds did. This contradicts previous results and indicates that color polymorphism may reduce the predation rate by birds.",W2146735007,True,0.9952382445335388

However, it is not yet understood whether niche packing is facilitated by higher specialization and reduced niche overlap or, rather, by diffuse competition and increased niche overlap. We combined highly resolved bird-plant interaction networks, bird phylogenies, and plant functional traits to compare dietary niche overlap and foraging frequencies among frugivorous birds at seven sites in the tropical Andes. We quantified niche overlap on the basis of the traits of the plants used by each bird and related it to the degree of niche packing at the different sites. Niche complementarity decreased with increasing niche packing, suggesting that increasingly dense niche packing is facilitated by increased niche overlap. Pairwise niche overlap was mediated by shifts in foraging frequencies away from shared resources, and it decreased with decreasing phylogenetic relatedness and increasing dependence on fruit as resource. Our findings suggest that foraging choices are a key axis of diversification in frugivorous birds and that differences in resource use frequencies are already sufficient to reduce potential competition between ecologically similar species and facilitate niche packing, especially if species differ in their dependence on particular resources.",W4200039699,True,0.9544066190719604
https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2015.0217,Sexual selection's impacts on ecological specialization: an experimental test,"In many species, individuals specialize on different resources, thereby reducing competition. Such ecological specialization can promote the evolution of alternative ecomorphs-distinct phenotypes adapted for particular resources. Elucidating whether and how this process is influenced by sexual selection is crucial for understanding how ecological specialization promotes the evolution of novel traits and, potentially, speciation between ecomorphs. We evaluated the population-level effects of sexual selection (as mediated by mate choice) on ecological specialization in spadefoot toad tadpoles that express alternative ecomorphs. We manipulated whether sexual selection was present or reversed by mating females to their preferred versus non-preferred males, respectively. We then exposed their tadpoles to resource competition in experimental mesocosms. The resulting distribution of ecomorphs was similar between treatments, but sexual selection generated poorer trait integration in, and lower fitness of, the more specialized carnivore morph. Moreover, disruptive and directional natural selection were weaker in the sexual selection present treatment. Nevertheless, this effect on disruptive selection was smaller than previously documented effects of ecological opportunity and competitor density. Thus, sexual selection can inhibit adaptation to resource competition and thereby hinder ecological specialization, particularly when females obtain fitness benefits from mate choice that offset the cost of producing competitively inferior offspring.",W2050802356,True,0.9878987669944763

However, it is still unclear how invasions may interact with local abiotic stressors, which are expected to increase as global change intensifies. Furthermore, we know little about the response to biological invasions of insects, despite their disproportionate contribution to global animal biodiversity. The aim of the present work is to investigate the impact of an invasive aquatic insect on the co‐occurrence patterns of native species of insects along a salinity gradient, and determine which assembly rules are driving these patterns. First, we characterised the habitat specialisation and functional niches of each species from physiological and biological traits, respectively, and their degree of overlap. Second, we used field data to compare the co‐occurrence patterns of native and invasive species in invaded and non‐invaded areas of southern Iberia and northern Morocco. Finally, we tested if habitat filtering or niche differentiation assembly rules mediate their co‐occurrence. In non‐invaded areas, habitat filtering drives habitat segregation of species along the salinity gradient, with a lower contribution of niche differentiation. The presence of the invasive insect modifies the distribution and co‐occurrence patterns of native species. In invaded areas, niche differentiation seems to be the main mechanism to avoid competition among the invasive and native species, enabling coexistence and resource partitioning. The combined study of functional niche similarity and abiotic stressor tolerance of invasive and native species can improve our understanding of the effects of invasive species along abiotic stress gradients. This approach may increase our capacity to predict the outcomes of biological invasion in a global change context. A lay summary is available for this article.",W2606521503,True,0.9395757913589478

Interactions between plants vary in space, over time and with organisational complexity. Yet it is challenging to quantify temporal, spatial and functional determinants of different types of interactions between long‐lived perennial plant species and their effect on lifetime fecundity. We studied how plant–plant, pollinator‐ and seed predator‐mediated interactions affect year‐to‐year variation in three fecundity components (cone production, seed set and seed survival) during post‐fire recovery. Age‐stratified data on the three fecundity components were collected in 19 even‐aged communities comprising 20 serotinous Protea shrub species in the South African Fynbos. We analyse data on these fecundity components with neighbourhood models to infer the sign and strength of interactions throughout post‐disturbance recovery, the neighbour plant traits that shape them and the spatial scale at which interactions take place. For each fecundity component, these models describe how neighbourhood effects change over time and with spatial distance between plants. We then predicted neighbourhood effects on individual fecundity components and cumulative reproductive output at different post‐fire stand ages for each focal plant. Competitive effects on cone production and seed set increased with post‐fire stand age as biomass and floral resources for pollinators build up. In contrast, neighbourhood effects on seed survival were weak throughout post‐disturbance recovery. Plant–plant interactions were shaped by neighbour traits related to resource acquisition, whereas animal‐mediated interactions depended on neighbour traits related to resource availability for pollinators and seed predators. The spatial scale of the interactions increased from plant–plant over predator‐mediated to pollinator‐mediated interactions. The joint effect of these interactions on cumulative reproductive output caused the proportion of focal plants experiencing competition to increase with time since fire. Synthesis. We show that temporal changes in biotic interactions throughout post‐disturbance recovery of perennial plant communities depend on functional traits and can be integrated into neighbourhood effects on lifetime fecundity. Studying the temporal, spatial and functional determinants of neighbourhood effects on lifetime fecundity is important for predicting not only individual plant fitness but also population and community dynamics in changing environments.",W4306407789,True,0.945717453956604
https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.4145,Not attackable or not crackable—How pre‐ and post‐attack defenses with different competition costs affect prey coexistence and population dynamics,"It is well-known that prey species often face trade-offs between defense against predation and competitiveness, enabling predator-mediated coexistence. However, we lack an understanding of how the large variety of different defense traits with different competition costs affects coexistence and population dynamics. Our study focusses on two general defense mechanisms, that is, pre-attack (e.g., camouflage) and post-attack defenses (e.g., weaponry) that act at different phases of the predator-prey interaction. We consider a food web model with one predator, two prey types and one resource. One prey type is undefended, while the other one is pre- or post-attack defended paying costs either by a higher half-saturation constant for resource uptake or a lower maximum growth rate. We show that post-attack defenses promote prey coexistence and stabilize the population dynamics more strongly than pre-attack defenses by interfering with the predator's functional response: Because the predator spends time handling ""noncrackable"" prey, the undefended prey is indirectly facilitated. A high half-saturation constant as defense costs promotes coexistence more and stabilizes the dynamics less than a low maximum growth rate. The former imposes high costs at low resource concentrations but allows for temporally high growth rates at predator-induced resource peaks preventing the extinction of the defended prey. We evaluate the effects of the different defense mechanisms and costs on coexistence under different enrichment levels in order to vary the importance of bottom-up and top-down control of the prey community.",W2808591369,True,0.9219390153884888
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090507,Biophysical Interactions Control the Size and Abundance of Large Phytoplankton Chains at the Ushant Tidal Front,"Phytoplankton blooms are usually dominated by chain-forming diatom species that can alter food pathways from primary producers to predators by reducing the interactions between intermediate trophic levels. The food-web modifications are determined by the length of the chains; however, the estimation is biased because traditional sampling strategies damage the chains and, therefore, change the phytoplankton size structure. Sedimentological studies around oceanic fronts have shown high concentrations of giant diatom mats (>1 cm in length), suggesting that the size of diatom chains is underestimated in the pelagic realm. Here, we investigate the variability in size and abundance of phytoplankton chains at the Ushant tidal front (NW France) using the Video Fluorescence Analyzer (VFA), a novel and non-invasive system. CTD and Scanfish profiling characterized a strong temperature and chlorophyll front, separating mixed coastal waters from the oceanic-stratified domain. In order to elucidate spring-neap variations in the front, vertical microstructure profiler was used to estimate the turbulence and vertical nitrate flux. Key findings were: (1) the VFA system recorded large diatom chains up to 10.7 mm in length; (2) chains were mainly distributed in the frontal region, with maximum values above the pycnocline in coincidence with the maximum chlorophyll; (3) the diapycnal fluxes of nitrate enabled the maintenance of the bloom in the frontal area throughout the spring-neap tidal cycle; (4) from spring to neap tide the chains length was significantly reduced; (5) during neap tide, the less intense vertical diffusion of nutrients, as well as the lower turbulence around the chains, intensified nutrient-depleted conditions and, thus, very large chains became disadvantageous. To explain this pattern, we suggest that size plasticity is an important ecological trait driving phytoplankton species competition. Although this plasticity behavior is well known from experiments in the laboratory, it has never been reported from observations in the field.",W2058069325,True,0.9905877709388733

A high percentage of cotton and maize in the United States and several other countries are transgenic cultivars that produce one or more of the insecticidal Cry proteins of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt). Here we quantify effects of three Cry proteins on the life history of these predators over two generations when they are exposed to these Cry proteins indirectly through their prey. To eliminate the confounding prey quality effects that can be introduced by Bt-susceptible prey, we used Cry1Ac/Cry2Ab-resistant Trichoplusia ni (Hübner) and Cry1 F-resistant Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) in a series of tri-trophic studies. Survival, development, adult mass, fecundity, and fertility were similar when predators consumed larvae feeding on Cry1Ac/Cry2Ab cotton or Cry1 F maize compared with prey feeding on isogenic or near-isogenic cotton or maize. Repeated exposure of the same initial cohort over a second generation also resulted in no differences in life-history traits when feeding on non-Bt- or Bt-fed prey. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that predators were exposed to Bt Cry proteins from their prey and that these proteins became increasingly diluted as they moved up the food chain. Results show a clear lack of effect of three common and widespread Cry proteins on these two important predator species. The use of resistant insects to eliminate prey quality effects provides a robust and meaningful assessment of exposure and hazard.",W2152812729,True,0.9432741403579712

However, few microbial ecological models address this trait, particularly concerning multiple enzyme functional groups that regulate complex biogeochemical processes. Here, we aim to fill this gap by developing a COmpetitive Dynamic Enzyme ALlocation (CODEAL) scheme for six enzyme groups that act as indicators of inorganic nitrogen (N) transformations in the Microbial-ENzyme Decomposition (MEND) model. This allocation scheme employs time-variant allocation coefficients for each enzyme group, fostering mutual competition among the multiple groups. We show that the principle of enzyme cost minimization is achieved by using the substrate's saturation level as the factor for enzyme allocation, resulting in an enzyme-efficient pathway with minimal enzyme cost per unit metabolic flux. It suggests that the relative substrate availability affects the trade-off between enzyme production and metabolic flux. Our research has the potential to give insights into the nuanced dynamics of the N cycle and inspire the evolving landscape of enzyme-mediated biogeochemical processes in microbial ecological modeling, which is gaining increasing attention.",W4388821973,True,0.9315507411956787

A key mediator of trophic cascades is body mass, as it both strongly influences and evolves in response to predator–prey interactions. Here, we use Gillespie eco-evolutionary models to explore EETCs resulting from top predator loss and mediated by body mass evolution. Our four-trophic-level food chain model uses allometric scaling to link body mass to different functions (ecological pleiotropy) and is realistically parameterized from the FORAGE database to mimic the parameter space of a typical freshwater system. To track real-time changes in selective pressures, we also calculated fitness gradients for each trophic level. As predicted, top predator loss generated alternating shifts in abundance across trophic levels, and, depending on the nature and strength in changes to fitness gradients, also altered trajectories of body mass evolution. Although more distantly linked, changes in the abundance of top predators still affected the eco-evolutionary dynamics of the basal producers, in part because of their relatively short generation times. Overall, our results suggest that impacts on top predators can set off transient EETCs with the potential for widespread indirect impacts on food webs.",W3097257102,True,0.9955147504806519
https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.690200,Can Top-Down Controls Expand the Ecological Niche of Marine N2 Fixers?,"The ability of marine diazotrophs to fix dinitrogen gas (N 2 ) is one of the most influential yet enigmatic processes in the ocean. With their activity diazotrophs support biological production by fixing about 100–200 Tg N/year and turning otherwise unavailable dinitrogen into bioavailable nitrogen (N), an essential limiting nutrient. Despite their important role, the factors that control the distribution of diazotrophs and their ability to fix N 2 are not fully elucidated. We discuss insights that can be gained from the emerging picture of a wide geographical distribution of marine diazotrophs and provide a critical assessment of environmental (bottom-up) versus trophic (top-down) controls. We expand a simplified theoretical framework to understand how top-down control affects competition for resources that determine ecological niches. Selective mortality, mediated by grazing or viral-lysis, on non-fixing phytoplankton is identified as a critical process that can broaden the ability of diazotrophs to compete for resources in top-down controlled systems and explain an expanded ecological niche for diazotrophs. Our simplified analysis predicts a larger importance of top-down control on competition patterns as resource levels increase. As grazing controls the faster growing phytoplankton, coexistence of the slower growing diazotrophs can be established. However, these predictions require corroboration by experimental and field data, together with the identification of specific traits of organisms and associated trade-offs related to selective top-down control. Elucidation of these factors could greatly improve our predictive capability for patterns and rates of marine N 2 fixation. The susceptibility of this key biogeochemical process to future changes may not only be determined by changes in environmental conditions but also via changes in the ecological interactions.",W3195391895,True,0.9800678491592407

The wide range of natural enemies of aphids, that are commercially available, is not a guarantee for successful control but rather an indication that this problem is difficult to tackle. Strategies for control vary among organic growers and it is still not known which natural enemy complexes give the best results. When releasing natural enemies for aphid control, it is important to consider the possible interactions with other pest species and natural enemies present. Within man-made natural enemy communities for multiple pest control, direct and indirect interactions occur which can enhance or disrupt biological control, such as predators eating other predators, behavioural changes, plant responses or apparent competition. Here we investigated the effects of the generalist predatory bugs Orius laevigatus and Orius majusculus on biological control of green peach aphids, Myzus persicae, by the predatory midge Aphidoletes aphidimyza in the absence or presence of thrips. Our results showed that intraguild predation of aphidophageous midges by generalist predatory bugs is a realistic phenomenon, but the risk of disruption of aphid control seems to be limited. The addition of thrips and O. majusculus to predatory midges even enhanced the suppression of aphids. We conclude that a broad system view with predator-prey complexes is required for identifying successful natural enemy complexes for aphid control. INTRODUCTION Aphids are the most destructive pest species in organically grown sweet peppers. The green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), especially the red phenotype, is notorious for its fast reproduction and tendency to colonize flowers and young leaves. This behaviour directly results in reduction in growth of the plant and fruit production. Moreover, the honeydew secreted by these aphids pollutes leaves and fruit, which consequently facilitates growth of sooty mould. Another damaging aphid species in sweet pepper is the foxglove aphid, Aulacorthum solani (Kaltenbach). This species typically induces strong plant responses such as yellow necrotic spots and leaf deformation, which can occur at low aphid densities. At higher densities, aphid-induced damage can result in leaf drop. Biological control of these aphids is mainly based on weekly releases of the parasitoids, Aphidius colemani Viereck and Aphidius ervi Haliday, and the predatory midge, Aphidoletes aphidimyza (Rondani). Additionally, growers release the slower reproducing wasps Aphelinus abdominalis (Dalman) and chrysopid, syrphid or coccinellid predators. Despite releases of mulitple natural enemies, biocontrol programs often do not succeed. One reason could be that these natural enemies interact with biocontrol agents that are released to control other pest species, such as generalist predatory mites and predatory bugs for the control of thrips. We recently showed that predatory mites strongly disrupt the biological control of aphids using the predatory midge, A. aphidimyza, because of hyperpredation of the midge eggs (Messelink et al., a Gerben.messelink@wur.nl Proc. First IC on Organic Greenhouse Hort. Eds.: M. Dorais and S.D. Bishop Acta Hort. 915, ISHS 2011 172 2011). Another threat for predatory midges could be the predation by generalist Orius bugs, which are mainly used for controlling thrips. These predators are known to feed not only on thrips, but also on aphids and the aphidophagous predator A. aphidimyza (Christensen et al., 2002). Such interactions have been referred to as intraguild predation (Fig. 1), which occurs when one predator species (the intraguild predator) kills and eats another predator species (the intraguild prey) with whom it also competes for shared prey (Polis et al., 1989; Holt and Polis, 1997). In theory, intraguild predation can disrupt biological control (Rosenheim et al., 1995), but in practice, results are mixed (Janssen et al., 2006, 2007; Vance-Chalcraft et al., 2007). Here we examine the effects of Orius laevigatus (Fieber) and Orius majusculus (Reuter) on the biological control of aphids with predatory midges in the presence of thrips as an alternative prey for Orius. Furthermore, we discuss the role of species interactions in developing management strategies for aphid control in sweet pepper. MATERIALS AND METHODS Rearing Sweet pepper plants, Capsicum annuum L. ‘Ferrari’ (Enza Zaden), were grown in rockwool blocks in a greenhouse compartment. We used the red phenotype of the green peach aphid, M. persicae, which was cultured on sweet pepper plants. Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), were cultured on flowering chrysanthemum plants, ‘Mirimar’. The predatory midge, A. aphidimyza, and predatory bug, O. laevigatus (Fieber), were obtained from Koppert Biological Systems (Berkel en Rodenrijs, The Netherlands), whereas the predatory bug, O. majusculus, was obtained from Biobest NV (Westerlo, Belgium). Greenhouse Experiment A cage experiment was carried out to assess the effects of predatory bugs on the suppression of aphids, in the presence of the predatory midge A. aphidimyza. Thrips were introduced to a subset of cages to provide an alternative prey for the predatory bugs. Individual flowering sweet pepper plants, ca. height 30 cm with 15–17 leaves, were put into a single cage (diameter 30 cm, height 40 cm, top with side-openings covered with insect gauze). Cages were placed on tables and maintained, at an average of 21°C, in one greenhouse compartment. The lower plant stem and roots in rockwool extended through a sealed hole at the bottom of the cages in order to allow automatic supply of a standard nutrient solution with an ebb-and-flow system. There were 8 treatments, with 4 replicates per treatment: (1) aphids only, (2) aphids + O. laevigatus + thrips, (3) aphids + O. majusculus + thrips, (4) aphids + A. aphidimyza, (5) aphids + A. aphidimyza + O. laevigatus, (6) aphids + A. aphidimyza + O. majusculus, (7) aphids + A. aphidimyza + O. laevigatus + thrips and (8) aphids + A. aphidimyza + O. majusculus + thrips. Each plant was infected with 20 aphids of mixed age, which were collected with a fine brush from the culture on sweet pepper. Adult thrips were introduced three times in the destined treatments in densities of 20, 20 and 40 females per plant after 1, 11 and 23 days post aphid release, respectively. Repeated releases of thrips were necessary because thrips proved to be controlled effectively. The predatory midge A. aphidimyza was introduced 10 days after aphid release by adding 10 pupae per cage in humid vermiculite. The adult midges emerged within 4 to 7 days, and no mortality of pupae was observed. Ten adult female predatory bugs were introduced 17 days after aphid release in each cage. The densities of all insects were assessed once, 28 days after aphid release, by checking all parts of each plant under a stereomicroscope (40x). For statistical analyses, we performed a standard ANOVA on the log transformed densities of insects. Differences among treatments were tested at the 5% level using Fisher’s Least Significant Difference (LSD) method.",W1597064921,True,0.936591386795044

This surprising coordination has long been recognized, yet there is little understanding of what controls it or why it has evolved. Interestingly, the conventional explanation for coordinated development in other parasite species does not seem to apply here. We argue that for malaria parasites, a critical question has yet to be answered: is the coordination due to parasites bursting at the same time or at a particular time? We explicitly delineate these fundamentally different scenarios, possible underlying mechanistic explanations and evolutionary drivers, and discuss the existing corroborating data and key evidence needed to solve this evolutionary mystery.

""…sa marraine lui recommanda sur toutes choses de ne pas passer minuit, l'avertissant que si elle demeurait au bal un moment davantage, son carrosse redeviendrait citrouille…""""Her godmother bade her not to stay beyond midnight whatever happened, warning her that if she remained at the ball a moment longer, her coach would again become a pumpkin"" – Charles Perrault For most malaria parasite species, the parasite cell cycle within a host is precisely coordinated – malaria parasites invade host red blood cells (RBCs), replicate asexually, and then release the next cohort of parasites in a burst that is synchronized across all parasites within the infection. Intriguingly, this synchronized bursting appears to occur at a particular time: Plasmodium chabaudi (rodent malaria) parasites, for instance, tend to synchronize bursting around midnight [1Landau I. Gautret P. Animal models: rodents.in: Sherman I.W. Malaria: Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis, and Protection. American Society for Microbiology, 1998: 401-417Google Scholar] (thus inspiring our title, although it is important to point out that other Plasmodium species burst at different times of the day/night). Although cell cycle duration varies across malaria parasite species, it is generally a multiple of 24 h (Figure 1). Indeed, the periodicity of fever that follows the simultaneous bursting of RBCs at the end of the cell cycle was once used as a diagnostic tool (e.g., the human parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium malariae have 48 and 72 h cycles, respectively, leading to 'tertian' or 'quartan' fevers [2Garcia C.R.S. et al.Tertian and quartan fevers: temporal regulation in malarial infection.J. Biol. Rhythms. 2001; 16: 436-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar]). Despite an early interest in evolutionary explanations for the coordination of malaria parasites (e.g., [3Hawking F. et al.The biological purpose of the blood cycles of the malaria parasite Plasmodium cynomolgi.Lancet. 1966; ii: 422-424Abstract Google Scholar]), work in recent years has focused on identifying proximate mechanisms for such rhythms. The 24-h cell cycles (or multiples thereof) are suggestive of a circadian basis, and the search continues for homologs of clock genes in the parasite genome [4Sherman I.W. Shocks and clocks.Adv. Parasitol. 2008; 67: 271-277Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar] and host circadian cues that could influence parasite cell cycles (e.g., melatonin [5Hotta C.T. et al.Calcium-dependent modulation by melatonin of the circadian rhythm in malarial parasites.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar]). By uncovering these mechanisms it may be possible to manipulate parasite schedules as a form of control. Interestingly, changes to parasite rhythms have been implicated in resistance to current front-line antimalarial drugs (artemisinin derivatives); parasites are thought to enter a quiescent state, delaying their development until the activity of drugs in their host has diminished (e.g., [6Witkowski B. et al.Increased tolerance to artemisinin in Plasmodium falciparum is mediated by a quiescence mechanism.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2010; 54: 1872-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 7LaCrue A.N. et al.Effects of artesunate on parasite recrudescence and dormancy in the rodent malaria model Plasmodium vinckei.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e26689Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar]). This highlights the need to understand why parasites have a precisely timed schedule at all, what the evolutionary constraints are on their developmental schedule, and what the consequences would be of targeting this fundamental part of malaria parasite biology. Circadian rhythms are endogenous patterns that persistently occur approximately every 24 h [8Rusak B. Zucker I. Biological rhythms and animal behavior.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 1975; 26: 137-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. These rhythms, entrained according to some external stimulus such as a photoperiod, are a consequence of organisms needing to predict changes in their environment, for example, to adopt appropriate activities for day and night [9Edmunds L.N. Cellular and Molecular Bases of Biological Clocks: Models and Mechanisms for Circadian Time-keeping. Springer, 1988Google Scholar]. Although coping with such periodic changes is a fundamental problem for organisms across the tree of life, establishing an adaptive basis for periodicity in behavior or physiological processes is not straightforward [10Sharma V.K. Adaptive significance of circadian clocks.Chronobiol. Int. 2003; 20: 901-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 11Yerushalmi S. Green R.M. Evidence for the adaptive significance of circadian rhythms.Ecol. Lett. 2009; 12: 970-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar]. More difficult still is explaining why parasites that mostly – or exclusively – live within the bodies of other organisms should evolve a circadian rhythm, yet malaria parasites are not unique in this respect. The conventional argument for the evolution of periodicity in parasites is that it optimizes the production of transmissible parasite forms given the diurnal rhythms of the environment. For example, coccidian parasites of the genus Isospora are infective to new hosts only after transmissible forms (immature oocysts) are excreted and have undergone further development in the external environment. These transmissible forms tend to emerge later in the day, apparently avoiding environmental conditions that are unfavorable to survival and development [12Dolnik O.V.

J. Parasitol. 2009; 39: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar]. Early work on malaria parasites emphasized similar evolutionary thinking, and the timing of foraging activity of mosquitoes (the malaria vector) was argued to be the key selection pressure driving cell cycle coordination [3Hawking F. et al.The biological purpose of the blood cycles of the malaria parasite Plasmodium cynomolgi.Lancet. 1966; ii: 422-424Abstract Google Scholar]. However, this 'Hawking hypothesis' lacks logical coherence and empirical validation (Box 1). The evolutionary drivers of the coordination of malaria parasite cell cycles therefore remain mysterious. Below we offer a conceptual framework for studying this phenomenon and evaluate other evolutionary hypotheses in the light of emerging insight into the mechanisms involved in generating rhythms in malaria parasites.Box 1Malaria transmission and the Hawking hypothesisTransmission of malaria to mosquitoes occurs via specialized parasite forms called gametocytes that are produced by a small subset of infected RBCs. The 'Hawking hypothesis' suggests that the production of gametocytes is coordinated so that they reach maturity and maximum infectiousness when mosquitoes feed [3Hawking F. et al.The biological purpose of the blood cycles of the malaria parasite Plasmodium cynomolgi.Lancet. 1966; ii: 422-424Abstract Google Scholar, 39Garnham P.C.C.

Trop. Med. Hyg. 1968; 62: 731-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar], but tests of its underlying assumptions have been equivocal. First, the hypothesis assumes that synchronized maturation of gametocytes requires synchronized bursting of all infected RBCs. Because gametocyte maturation can take as long as 15 days (for P. falciparum [41Bousema T. Drakeley C.

Rev. 2011; 24: 377-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar]), even slight differences between gametocytes in maturation rates could accumulate to result in differences of many hours by the time maturation is complete. Second, the hypothesis assumes that mature gametocytes circulate in the bloodstream for less than a day (or only one bout of mosquito foraging). Although estimates suggest that the gametocytes of a few malaria species have circulation times on the order of hours [42Gautret P. Motard A.

Finally, it assumes that maximum infectiousness coincides with peak mosquito biting activity, which is a pattern that most studies have failed to find (e.g., [45Bray R.S. et al.Lack of a circadian rhythm in the ability of the gametocytes of Plasmodium falciparum to infect Anopheles gambiae.Int.

We agree that more detailed data are required to fully understand any rhythms in gametocyte and vector biology, but argue that the bulk of evidence against the Hawking hypothesis is probably insurmountable.

It has been argued that data on infectivity are too sparse to confidently reject the Hawking hypothesis [48Gautret P. Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte periodicity.Acta Trop. 2001; 78: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar]. We agree that more detailed data are required to fully understand any rhythms in gametocyte and vector biology, but argue that the bulk of evidence against the Hawking hypothesis is probably insurmountable. From our perspective, what has been lacking from studies of malaria parasite cell cycles is an explicit recognition that the observed coordination could be the effect of selection for either synchrony or timing (see Figure I in Box 2); most evolutionary hypotheses have implicitly assumed that parasites gain an evolutionary advantage from one of these traits and ignored the other. For simplicity, we refer to synchrony and timing as 'traits' but stress that in reality these phenotypes are the outcome of several underlying traits. Alternatively, coordination may provide no evolutionary advantage to parasites, may actually benefit hosts, and may be entirely under the control of hosts. Framing the evolution of coordination in this way reveals five possible 'selective scenarios', outlined below and detailed in Table 1.(i)Synchrony of cell cycles is an adaptation of malaria parasites that enhances their fitness. For example, synchrony could provide parasites with safety in numbers from immune attack. To coordinate this synchrony, parasites could either communicate directly (e.g., via a development communicating mechanism [15Dyer M. Day T. Regulation of the rate of asexual growth and commitment to sexual development by diffusable factors from in vitro cultures of Plasmodium falciparum.Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2003; 68: 403-409PubMed Google Scholar]), they could have their own internal clock, or they could use timing cues from host circadian rhythms [2Garcia C.R.S. et al.Tertian and quartan fevers: temporal regulation in malarial infection.J. Biol. Rhythms. 2001; 16: 436-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Hotta C.T. et al.Calcium-dependent modulation by melatonin of the circadian rhythm in malarial parasites.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar]. In the first case, synchrony and timing would not be linked and so synchronized parasites in different hosts may burst at different times of day. In the latter two cases, because parasites are using time cues to achieve synchrony, bursting at a precise time would likely be a byproduct of selection for synchrony (but does not provide an additional advantage to parasites).(ii)The timing of bursting is an adaptation of malaria parasites (i.e., infected RBCs bursting at a particular time of the day/night maximizes fitness). For example, timing could allow parasites to avoid a circadian release of parasite killing immune responses or match the appearance of essential resources. Assuming a particular schedule offers the same benefit to all parasites in an infection, synchrony would be a byproduct of the evolution of timing because all parasites would be on the same schedule. Parasites could set the timing of cell cycle development either indirectly by using cues from the host circadian rhythm or directly using their own internal 'clock'.(iii)Synchrony and timing of cell cycles are both adaptations of malaria parasites and may be selected for through different processes. In other words, each trait offers a distinct fitness advantage, that is, some combination of (i) and (ii).(iv)Neither synchrony nor timing of cell cycles is an adaptation of malaria parasites. Instead, the coordination of cell cycles offers some advantage to hosts. For example, concentrating particular parasite cell cycle stages to a particular time of day could maximize the efficacy of immune factors with circadian rhythms [16McQueen P.G. McKenzie F.E. Host control of malaria infections: constraints on immune and erythropoeitic response kinetics.PLoS Comp. Biol. 2008; 4: e1000149Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar] or could limit invasion success by maximizing competition between parasites for host RBCs.(v)Neither synchrony nor timing of cell cycles is an adaptation of malaria parasites or hosts. Instead, parasites are passively traversing their life cycle and the cell cycle pattern is constrained by physiological or physical features of either, or both, hosts and parasites (see Figure II in Box 2). Under this scenario, the coordination of parasite development may be neutral or costly to either hosts or parasites.Box 2The malaria cell cycle and its potential constraintsMalaria parasites replicate asexually within host RBCs before bursting and releasing the progeny parasites (merozoites), each with the capacity to invade other RBCs and begin a new cycle of replication. Explaining the evolutionary significance of the observed periodicity of malaria infections requires considering the importance of two distinct traits (Figure I).Figure II illustrates the potential constraints on malaria parasite cell cycles.Figure IIPhysical and physiological constraints on cell cycles. The physical processes of RBC invasion and parasite replication take time, meaning that merozoite release cannot happen before a time, t0. Although malaria parasites complete all nuclear divisions prior to cellular division [50Leete T.H. Rubin H. Malaria and the cell cycle.Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 442-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar] (making the process more efficient), increasing the number of merozoites produced could increase the time required until a mature schizont is ready to burst. Plasmodium species that produce different numbers of merozoites may therefore have different values of t0. At the other end of the spectrum, once the nuclear divisions have been completed, there may be an upper limit on bursting time, t1, as parasites may be constrained by passive processes that cause bursting, through deterioration of the infected RBC or bursting under osmotic stress [51Lew V.L. et al.Excess hemoglobin digestion and the osmotic stability of Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells.Blood. 2003; 101: 4189-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar]. The difference between times t0 and t1 define the window of opportunity during which parasites can burst from infected RBCs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Recent experimental work suggests that infected RBCs are, indeed, not bursting at the earliest possible opportunity, t0, [49Grüring C. et al.Development and host cell modifications of Plasmodium falciparum blood stages in four dimensions.Nat.

[49Grüring C. et al.Development and host cell modifications of Plasmodium falciparum blood stages in four dimensions.Nat. Commun. 2011; 2: 165Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar] demonstrate that merozoite formation and the maturation of schizonts are completed several hours before bursting. Although not conclusive evidence, because it is not clear whether merozoites are finished developing at the submicroscopic level, this suggests that schizonts are not bursting as soon as possible and that they are waiting for some cue that either allows them to synchronize [scenario (i)], forces them to synchronize [scenario (iv)], or signals optimal timing of bursting [scenarios (ii) or (iii)].Table 1Putative evolutionary explanationsaNon-mutually exclusive. for coordination as an adaptation of malaria parasitesUltimate explanationSelective scenariobThe selective scenario indicates which 'trait' is under selection: (i) denotes a direct advantage to synchrony and (ii) denotes a direct advantage to timing.Key evidence required to evaluate hypothesesTransmission1.

https://doi.org/10.3120/0024-9637-68.4.406,DO HABITAT SHIFTS ALTER FLOWERING PHENOLOGY OVERLAP IN CLOSE RELATIVES? IMPLICATIONS FOR LOCAL COEXISTENCE,"Flowering time in plants is a highly variable trait that influences species' resource use and exchange of pollen with con- and heterospecifics. Levin (2009) suggested that habitat shifts within species might cause plastic shifts in flowering phenology, reducing pollen exchange across habitats. Coupled with divergent selection across habitats, diverged flowering time might thus pave the way towards ecological speciation. Some of these ideas may apply across species as well. If close heterospecific relatives share phylogenetically conserved flowering times and negatively affect each other's fitness, habitat shifts to microallopatry might provide a means for local coexistence by close relatives by reducing resource competition, shared enemies, or negative interactions via pollination. Habitat shifts might also select for diverged flowering time, or cause flowering time divergence, if phylogenetically conserved cues arrive at different times across habitats. Here, we ask if flowering phenology is phylogenetically conserved for 208 species at our coastal field site in northern California, whether flowering phenology differs systematically across habitat types, and whether habitat shifts are associated with phenological separation, especially in congeners. Because annuality and perenniality have been shown to be associated with habitat traits and flowering time, we included life history in our analyses as well. We also explore the frequency of habitat shifts between congener and noncongener pairs. We use both field observations and data from Jepson eFlora/Jepson Manual 2 (Baldwin et al. 2012) to explore patterns in flowering phenology. The two data sources were well-correlated across 59 species. Phylogeny, habitat, and life history all influenced flowering time, and habitat and life history were also phylogenetically conserved across 208 spp. Congeners differed in habitat more often than noncongener pairs, and also overlapped more in flowering time. Habitat shifts were not associated with shifts in flowering time in congeners, despite mean peak flowering time differences across habitats, and phylogenetic conservatism in habitat use. Congeners that differed in both habitat use and life history, however, did have the greatest difference in peak flowering dates. Habitat shifts likely play a role in local coexistence of close relatives, but our data do not support habitat-mediated changes in phenology as a possible mechanism. Experimental approaches may elucidate the role of phenology, resource competition, pollinators, and other associates in mediating coexistence of congeners at our coastal California field site.",W4200399770,True,0.9768368005752563

We examined patterns of growth and morphology in Fraxinus excelsior seedlings germinating in the presence or absence of grass competition (Dactylis glomerata) at either low (380 p.p.m.) or high (645 p.p.m.) atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and at two levels of nitrogen (N) nutrition. 2 Elevated CO2 had a positive effect on Fraxinus dry mass irrespective of N treatment, but the magnitude of growth response was small. In contrast, Dactylis dry mass showed a significant CO2 × N interaction: no apparent response to elevated CO2 in the low N treatment compared with a 25% dry mass increase in the high N, high CO2 treatment. 3 Dactylis and Fraxinus showed greater responses to N compared with CO2 in terms of dry mass, morphology and biomass allocation. The direction of Fraxinus responses to N varied depending on the trait examined and the grass competition treatment. 4 Both the competitive intensity (Cint) and the importance of the competition (Cimp) experienced by Fraxinus seedlings increased with an increase in N availability. Contrary to expectations, elevated CO2 had no significant effect on either Cint or Cimp. 5 Plant plasticity may have important implications for the long-term success of tree seedlings in grasslands. Our results suggest that the combination of both grass and tree seedling responses to CO2 may have indirect benefits for the persistence of woody invaders in high-nutrient grasslands under future atmospheric conditions.",W2161504226,True,0.9521316885948181
https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9599,Can diet niche partitioning enhance sexual dimorphism?,"Classic evolutionary theory suggests that sexual dimorphism evolves primarily via sexual and fecundity selection. However, theory and evidence are beginning to accumulate suggesting that resource competition can drive the evolution of sexual dimorphism, via ecological character displacement between sexes. A key prediction of this hypothesis is that the extent of ecological divergence between sexes will be associated with the extent of sexual dimorphism. As the stable isotope ratios of animal tissues provide a quantitative measure of various aspects of ecology, we carried out a meta-analysis examining associations between the extent of isotopic divergence between sexes and the extent of body size dimorphism. Our models demonstrate that large amounts of between-study variation in isotopic (ecological) divergence between sexes is nonrandom and may be associated with the traits of study subjects. We, therefore, completed meta-regressions to examine whether the extent of isotopic divergence between sexes is associated with the extent of sexual size dimorphism. We found modest but significantly positive associations across species between size dimorphism and ecological differences between sexes, that increased in strength when the ecological opportunity for dietary divergence between sexes was greatest. Our results, therefore, provide further evidence that ecologically mediated selection, not directly related to reproduction, can contribute to the evolution of sexual dimorphism.",W4311874724,True,0.9885498285293579
https://doi.org/10.3390/d17020108,Ecological Traits and Intraguild Competition Mediate Spatial and Temporal Overlaps Among Sympatric Mesocarnivores,"In terrestrial mammalian carnivore guilds, interspecific competitions (interferences and resource competitions) among sympatric species induce their ecological and behavioral patterns and population dynamics, thereby shaping community structures. Competitive species must partition their ecological niches for sympatry, while the extent of niche overlaps is mediated by either the ecological traits (e.g., body size differences) or environmental features. We aimed to elucidate the patterns of spatial and temporal niche overlaps in mesocarnivore guilds, which are mediated by their ecological traits, regional environments, and anthropogenic disturbances. We investigated the spatial occurrence and diel activities of six mesocarnivore species and estimated their spatial and temporal overlap indices in various landscapes with different anthropogenic disturbances in central Bulgaria. Statistical modeling demonstrated that spatial overlap among mesocarnivores declined when mesocarnivore pairs were within the same family and when large carnivores (particularly wolves, Canis lupus) were present. Furthermore, we found that the extent of their temporal overlaps was associated with taxonomic and body size differences in mesocarnivore pairs as well as their trophic competitions. Our findings indicated that the intensity of interferences among mesocarnivore species was key for the decline of spatial or temporal niche overlap to relax antagonistic interactions.",W4407108510,True,0.9901580810546875

Male House Finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) are an exception, however, as drab males tend to be more aggressive than bright males during the breeding season and in winter. One hypothesis for this 'negatively correlated handicap' is that drab male house finches, being comparatively sexually unattractive and in poor health and condition, have more to gain by elevating aggression and increasing access to food and pursuit of (especially extra-pair) mates. It would seem important then to test this hypothesis during the period of molt, when birds are actively acquiring the foods and carotenoid pigments that make them colorful and a time in which there is a clear link between plumage color and nutrition/health in this species. We conducted two captive dominance experiments with male House Finches from the southwestern United States (their native range) to examine the relationship between carotenoid-based plumage coloration and aggression during molt. In the first experiment, where birds exhibited their natural, currently growing plumage color, we found that drab males were significantly more aggressive than bright males. However, when plumage colors were manipulated with art markers in a second experiment, color display was no longer significantly predictive of agonistic outcomes. These results suggest that: (1) drab male dominance is not an artifact in eastern US populations and instead is a conserved property of native and non-native House Finches, (2) like in our previous studies in winter, plumage color is correlated with dominance but does not serve as a visual signal of social status in this species, and (3) drab males should have a competitive advantage over access to important carotenoid-rich foods during molt, but apparently do not become as colorful because they do not adequately locate carotenoid-rich foods or do not use them efficiently for energetic or health reasons, which are perhaps exacerbated by elevated testosterone levels.",W2130091591,True,0.9624802470207214

Spotless starling males ( Sturnus unicolor ) carry green plants into their nests before egg laying, and recent studies have shown that this behaviour is related to female breeding decisions and the production of male‐biased broods. Although the functional implications of this effect on females are not yet clear, data suggest that it could be mediated by female circulating hormones. Additionally, females may show higher androgen levels as a consequence of the increased female–female competition generated by the increase in male attractiveness. We tested this hypothesis using the same manipulation of green nesting material that has been previously shown to result in an increase of male attractiveness in male spotless starlings. We found that females in experimental nests increased their circulating testosterone levels during the laying period. In addition, there was an increase of social interferences in the experimental nests because of the addition of green plants. We hypothesise that testosterone may allow females to maintain their mating status when competing with other females for the preferred males. Addition of green plants also increased the variance in the levels of circulating testosterone, suggesting plasticity between females in their response to the manipulation. We propose that there is a functional link between high testosterone levels, male‐biased sex ratios and female resource‐holding potential in intra‐sexual competition in this species.",W2153913015,True,0.9354386925697327

However, empirical evidence for this trade-off is mixed, raising questions about the extent to which it shapes diverse ecological communities. Here, we outline a framework that can be used to improve empirical tests of the competition-colonization trade-off. We argue that tests of the competition-colonization trade-off have been diverted into unproductive paths when dispersal mode and/or competition type have been inadequately defined. To generate comparative predictions of associations between dispersal and competitive performance, we develop a conceptual trait-based framework that clarifies how dispersal mode and type of competitor shape this trade-off at the stage of dispersal and establishment in a variety of systems. Our framework suggests that competition-colonization trade-offs may be less common for passively dispersing organisms when competitive dominants are those best able to withstand resource depletion (competitive response), and for active dispersers when traits for dispersal performance are positively associated with resource pre-emption (competitive effect). The framework presented here is designed to provide common ground for researchers working in different systems in order to prompt more effective assessment of this performance trade-off and its role in shaping community structure. By delineating key system properties that mediate the trade-off between competitive and colonization performance and their relationship to individual-level traits, researchers in disparate systems can structure their predictions about this trade-off more effectively and compare across systems more clearly.",W4309244382,True,0.9818287491798401

For example, genetic variation in an herbivore could alter plant responses that then influence other plant‐associated arthropods. However, few systems have experimentally tested the ecological consequences of genetic variation as mediated through other species, especially within the same trophic community context. I studied how evolution of feeding preference in the willow leaf beetle ( P lagiodera versicolora ), which occurs under selection in a herbivore community context, feeds back to an arthropod community through plant‐mediated indirect interactions. Previous studies show beetle populations locally adapt distinct preferences ranging from the gourmet‐type, which feeds exclusively on new leaves of willows, to the no‐preference (no‐pref) type, which displays non‐preferential feeding on leaves of different ages. I conducted field experiments at two sites that mimicked evolutionary changes in the feeding preference of the leaf beetle. I manipulated the composition of leaf beetle feeding types for 6 days in spring and then investigated subsequent development of arthropod communities. I found that initial herbivory by a higher proportion of gourmet‐type beetles led to lower subsequent abundance of conspecific beetle larvae. In contrast, a higher proportion of gourmet‐type beetles resulted in higher abundance of aphids. Aphid‐tending ants also increased with the increasing abundance of aphids. As a result, species diversity of arthropod communities decreased with the proportion of gourmet‐type beetles in the initial beetle treatment. Community assembly dynamics were significantly influenced by interactive effects between the initial beetle treatment and subsequent colonizer species identities. Thus, beetle genetic variation had long‐lasting effects through a temporal chain of indirect interactions likely mediated through induced plant responses and the abundance of aphids. Synthesis. Evolutionary changes in feeding traits within an herbivore species had profound but predictable impact on local arthropod communities. Because the feeding evolution of herbivores nearly always occurs in a community context, plant‐mediated feedback loops between the evolution and ecological community of arthropods may be widespread in nature.",W1964110385,True,0.9958949089050293

Utilizing morphological, genetic, and stable isotope techniques, we found no evidence of discrete trophic morphotypes as previously described, but instead found evidence for an ontogenetic diet shift. Carbon and nitrogen isotope data indicate a 40% decrease in the proportion of benthic feeding and an increase of one trophic position over the size and age ranges of adult kokanee, corresponding to a diet shift from consumption of macroinvertebrates in smaller individuals to piscivory in larger individuals. This novel piscivory in kokanee may result from predatory and competitive freedom resulting from the lack of limnetic predators in Jo-Jo Lake. Piscivorous feeding despite a phenotype–environment mismatch has resulted in large, piscivorous kokanee having up to 70% of their gill rakers damaged. Observed reductions in gill raker number relative to the putative ancestral population are convergent with expectations for piscivorous fishes, despite a presumed lack of standing genetic variation for piscivory in the sockeye salmon – kokanee species complex.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242965,Destabilizing effects on a classic tri-trophic oyster-reef cascade,"How interactions among multiple predators affect the stability of trophic cascades is a topic of special ecological interest. To examine factors affecting the stability of the classic tri-trophic oyster reef cascade within a different context, configurations of three predators, including the Gulf toadfish, Gulf stone crab, and oystershell mud crab, were manipulated together with either oyster shell or limestone gravel substrate within a multiple predator effects (MPE) experiment. Additionally, a complimentary set of trait-mediated-indirect interaction (TMII) experiments examined the inhibition of oyster consumption relative to mud-crab size and top predator identity in the absence of other cues and factors. The classic tri-trophic cascade formed by the toadfish-mud crab-oyster configuration was potentially weakened by several interactions within the MPE experiment. Consumption of oysters and mud crabs by the intraguild stone crab was undeterred by the presence of toadfish. Although mud crab feeding was inhibited in the presence of both toadfish and stone crabs, estimated non-consumptive effects (NCEs) were weaker for stone crabs in the MPE experiment. Consequently, the total effect was destabilizing when all three predator species were together. Inhibition of mud crab feeding was inversely related to direct predation on mud crabs within the MPE experiment. Complimentary TMII experiments revealed greater inhibition of mud crab feeding in response to stone crabs under sparse conditions. TMII experiments also implied that inhibition of mud crab feeding could have largely accounted for NCEs relative to oysters within the MPE experiment, as opposed to interference by other mud crabs or top predators. An inverse relationship between mud crab size and NCE strength in the TMII experiment disclosed another potentially destabilizing influence on the tri-trophic-cascade. Finally, although habitat complexity generally dampened the consumption of oysters across MPE treatments, complex habitat promoted mud crab feeding in the presence of toadfish alone. This study underscores how ecological interactions can mediate trophic cascades and provides some additional insights into the trophic dynamics of oyster reefs for further testing under natural conditions.",W3113191423,True,0.9961141347885132

This may favor the evolution of defective traits that are harmful to the species population as a whole, and that may lead to its dilution or even to its extinction (the tragedy of the commons). Here, we show that this phenomenon can be circumvented by cooperation plasticity, in which an individual decides, based on environmental conditions, whether to cooperate or to defect. Specifically, we analyze the evolution of density-dependent cooperation. In our model, the population is spatially subdivided, periodically remixed, and comprises several species. We find that evolution pushes individuals to be more cooperative when their own species is at lower densities, and we show that not only could this cooperation prevent the tragedy of the commons, but it could also facilitate coexistence between many species that compete for the same resource.",W1854240259,True,0.9404155611991882
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.14039,Ant body size mediates functional performance and species interactions in carrion decomposer communities,"Abstract Growing concern over rapid species declines and extinctions has led to considerable interest in the role of biodiversity for maintaining ecological processes. However, the loss of particular species has more pronounced effects on ecosystem services than others, highlighting the importance of key functional species traits and their relationships to ecosystem functioning. Human‐induced disturbances, such as species invasions, land use changes, or abiotic changes, appear to disproportionally impact larger species rather than smaller ones. The loss of large‐bodied species in the community diminishes key ecosystem services like seed dispersal, pest control, pollination and decomposition. Here, we use carrion, a nutrient‐rich ephemeral resource, to test the hypotheses that ants positively affect decomposition rates and that their role in the necrophilous community—as predator or decomposer—is mediated by body size. We further investigate the relative contribution of maggots versus ants to biomass decomposition. Our results show that ants contributed positively to the decomposition process. Moreover, decomposition was shaped by an intricate interplay between competition and predation among the guild of decomposer insects. As predicted, larger ants show a double action in increasing decomposition rate and predating on maggots, while small ants are rather inefficient decomposers and did not act as predators on other decomposer species. Our study shows that differentiating key taxonomic groups in function of their body size is key to untangle the diversity and directions of the various roles they play within complex ecological processes.

The coexistence of competing species in spatially fragmented habitats may be achieved, however, due to niche partitioning and alternative responses to patch characteristics. To evaluate responses to resource patterns facilitating coexistence, we examined the resource use patterns of four parasitoid species ( O rthopelma mediator, P teromalus bedeguaris, T orymus bedeguaris and G lyphomerus stigma ) of the gall inducer D iplolepis rosae at both landscape and local scales. Parasitoid species of rose gall communities behave differently at landscape and local scales. Parasitism rates and parasitoid incidence showed correlations with local characteristics in some cases, with landscape characteristics in others and, in some other cases with both. Species responses to the examined characteristics depend rather on life history traits of parasitoids than on their frequency within the community. The examined parasitoids responded differently to landscape and local characteristics, while their phenology corresponded with their responses. Species emerging earlier in spring ( O. mediator and P. bedeguaris) responded only to local variations, while later emerging species ( T. bedeguaris and G. stigma ) were sensitive to landscape characteristics as well. Differences between species‐specific and overall responses highlight the importance of species characteristics when considering multiparasitoid communities, and support both fine and coarse partitioning between different species coexisting in the community.",W2157608172,True,0.9916989207267761

Tropical Tree Growth and Its Response to Climate Anomalies Is Mediated by Neighbourhood Hierarchy and Dissimilarity in Carbon‐ and Water‐Related Traits,"ABSTRACT Taxonomic diversity effects on forest productivity and response to climate extremes range from positive to negative, suggesting a key role for complex interactions among neighbouring trees. To elucidate how neutral interactions, hierarchical competition and resource partitioning between neighbours' shape tree growth and climate response in a highly diverse Amazonian forest, we combined 30 years of tree censuses with measurements of water‐ and carbon‐related traits. We modelled individual tree growth response to climate and neighbourhood to disentangle the relative effect of neighbourhood densities, trait hierarchies and dissimilarities. While neighbourhood densities consistently decreased growth, trait dissimilarity increased it, and both had the potential to influence climate response. Greater water conservatism provided a competitive advantage to focal trees in normal years, but water–spender neighbours reduced this effect in dry years. By underlining the importance of density and trait‐mediated neighbourhood interactions, our study offers a way towards improving predictions of forest dynamics.",W4409246288,True,0.9554720520973206
https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/art069,Prey handling performance facilitates competitive dominance of an invasive over native keystone ant,"Studies of species coexistence in ant communities often suggest that competitive interactions are mediated by behavioral trade-offs between resource discovery and dominance. However, these studies have always measured foraging at artificial, static baits that omit traits of living prey items and potential coevolutionary predator–prey relationships. In a series of lab experiments, we compare the ability of ants to harvest live termites (Reticulitermes virginicus) in nests varying in defensive ability. Moreover, we compare foraging performance of 2 co-occurring ant species—the North American native Aphaenogaster rudis and the invasive Pachycondyla chinensis—differing in their evolutionary experience hunting R. virginicus. Our results show how the invasive P. chinensis may displace the native keystone A. rudis by directly killing A. rudis workers and reducing termite prey available for A. rudis. Specifically, P. chinensis is more sensitive to novel termite prey than the native A. rudis and then destroys termite colonies—even if they are highly defended by soldiers or nest architecture. Our results further show how whole colony behavioral dominance by P. chinensis is mediated by behavioral interactions among individual workers. More generally, our experimental approach using live prey to study interspecific competition can integrate evolutionary dynamics into studies of proximate behavioral factors governing species coexistence.",W2143843862,True,0.9562001824378967
https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.7211,Investigating the morphological and genetic divergence of arctic char (<i>Salvelinus alpinus)</i> populations in lakes of arctic Alaska,"Abstract Polymorphism facilitates coexistence of divergent morphs (e.g., phenotypes) of the same species by minimizing intraspecific competition, especially when resources are limiting. Arctic char ( Salvelinus sp.) are a Holarctic fish often forming morphologically, and sometimes genetically, divergent morphs. In this study, we assessed the morphological and genetic diversity and divergence of 263 individuals from seven populations of arctic char with varying length‐frequency distributions across two distinct groups of lakes in northern Alaska. Despite close geographic proximity, each lake group occurs on landscapes with different glacial ages and surface water connectivity, and thus was likely colonized by fishes at different times. Across lakes, a continuum of physical (e.g., lake area, maximum depth) and biological characteristics (e.g., primary productivity, fish density) exists, likely contributing to characteristics of present‐day char populations. Although some lakes exhibit bimodal size distributions, using model‐based clustering of morphometric traits corrected for allometry, we did not detect morphological differences within and across char populations. Genomic analyses using 15,934 SNPs obtained from genotyping by sequencing demonstrated differences among lake groups related to historical biogeography, but within lake groups and within individual lakes, genetic differentiation was not related to total body length. We used PERMANOVA to identify environmental and biological factors related to observed char size structure. Significant predictors included water transparency (i.e., a primary productivity proxy), char density (fish·ha ‐1 ), and lake group. Larger char occurred in lakes with greater primary production and lower char densities, suggesting less intraspecific competition and resource limitation. Thus, char populations in more productive and connected lakes may prove more stable to environmental changes, relative to food‐limited and closed lakes, if lake productivity increases concomitantly. Our findings provide some of the first descriptions of genomic characteristics of char populations in arctic Alaska, and offer important consideration for the persistence of these populations for subsistence and conservation.",W3135711211,True,0.9000526666641235

Here, in order to examine whether competition mechanisms can affect the foraging behaviour of wild Salmo trutta with respect to active-bottom, benthic-drift or surface-drift foraging, three neighbouring populations under different levels of fish density (high, intermediate and low) were studied. We analysed the foraging behaviour of each population according to niche breadth, prey preferences, the modified Costello graphical method and prey trait analysis. The results revealed a remarkable similarity in the feeding behaviour among these feral fish populations, suggesting a foraging behaviour convergence in response to site-specific prey accessibility. A generalist foraging behaviour was the prevailing feeding strategy, independent of fish density. Hence, this study offered evidence for the occurrence of density-independent individual foraging behaviour when food is abundant and available; however, density-dependent foraging behaviour might occur when resource limitation exists. Studies under natural conditions like the present study are needed to increase ecological realism, and indeed this study opens promising research directions for future feeding studies in territorial fish species.",W2004044438,True,0.981870710849762
https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.14277,Changes in ecological conditions may influence intraguild competition: inferring interaction patterns of snow leopard with co-predators,"Background Large-scale changes in habitat conditions due to human modifications and climate change require management practices to consider how species communities can alter amidst these changes. Understanding species interactions across the gradient of space, anthropogenic pressure, and season provide the opportunity to anticipate possible dynamics in the changing scenarios. We studied the interspecific interactions of carnivore species in a high-altitude ecosystem over seasonal (summer and winter) and resource gradients (livestock grazing) to assess the impact of changing abiotic and biotic settings on coexistence. Methods The study was conducted in the Upper Bhagirathi basin, Western Himalaya, India. We analyzed around 4 years of camera trap monitoring data to understand seasonal spatial and temporal interactions of the snow leopard with common leopard and woolly wolf were assessed in the greater and trans-Himalayan habitats, respectively. We used two species occupancy models to assess spatial interactions, and circadian activity patterns were used to assess seasonal temporal overlap amongst carnivores. In addition, we examined scats to understand the commonalities in prey selection. Results The result showed that although snow leopard and wolves depend on the same limited prey species and show high temporal overlap, habitat heterogeneity and differential habitat use facilitate co-occurrence between these two predators. Snow leopard and common leopard were spatially independent in the summer. Conversely, the common leopard negatively influences the space use of snow leopard in the winter. Limited prey resources (lack of livestock), restricted space (due to snow cover), and similar activity patterns in winter might result in strong competition, causing these species to avoid each other on a spatial scale. The study showed that in addition to species traits and size, ecological settings also play a significant role in deciding the intensity of competition between large carnivores. Climate change and habitat shifts are predicted to increase the spatial overlap between snow leopard and co-predators in the future. In such scenarios, wolves and snow leopards may coexist in a topographically diverse environment, provided sufficient prey are available. However, shifts in tree line might lead to severe competition between common leopards and snow leopards, which could be detrimental to the latter. Further monitoring of resource use across abiotic and biotic environments may improve our understanding of how changing ecological conditions can affect resource partitioning between snow leopards and predators.",W4307245106,True,0.9810762405395508
https://doi.org/10.1655/herpetologica-d-14-00031,Stream Salamanders Accurately Assess Size-Dependent Predation Threats,"Individual size is an important determinant of the outcomes of inter- and intraspecific interactions. Different-sized members of a guild might represent prey, competitors, or predators. Although direct predation rates might be low, trait-mediated indirect effects of predators on prey can yield altered activity, microhabitat use, survival, and growth. If individuals respond to all sizes of a predator regardless of the predation threat, antipredator behaviors might incur costs for prey as they forgo foraging opportunities or experience predation by other predators. Accurate assessment of predation risk would minimize costs resulting from antipredator behavior. We evaluated the ability of larval salamanders to assess predation risk and alter their habitat selection in response to intraguild competitors and predators. Specifically, we assessed behavioral responses to the presence of a conspecific, a similarly sized heterospecific, and a small or large individual of a predatory species. We predicted that larval salamanders would select habitat differently in the presence of a large predatory heterospecific, but not in the presence of similarly sized heterospecifics or conspecifics. The focal species occupied habitat 29 ± 0.02% farther from a large heterospecific predator than from small heterospecifics, even if the heterospecifics were smaller individuals of the predatory species. The focal species also exhibited escape behaviors only in the presence of the large members of the predatory species. These data indicate that salamander larvae can assess size-specific predation threats, minimizing predation risk through use of antipredator behaviors.",W2201100592,True,0.9927840828895569
https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.815011,N-Induced Species Loss Dampened by Clipping Mainly Through Suppressing Dominant Species in an Alpine Meadow,"Nitrogen addition and clipping can exert substantial impact on species diversity but their interactions and the underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. Resource competition theory holds that sufficiently strong competitive ability of dominant species can lead to the losses of subordinate species through competitive exclusion, while niche differentiation theory suggests that the persistence of subordinate species in competitive systems can be promoted by guaranteeing positive growth rates of rare species. Taking advantage of a field experiment with nitrogen addition (10 g N m-2 year-1) and different clipping intensities (2, 15, and 30 cm) treatments in a Tibetan alpine meadow across 2015-2020, we assessed the relative importance of competitively dominant species and niche differentiation in driving species diversity changes via using community weighted mean (CWM) and variation coefficient of nearest neighbor distance (CV_NND) of functional traits including height, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC). We show that nitrogen enrichment drove a strong plant diversity loss (P < 0.001). Clipping at different intensities had little effect on species diversity, but it can reduce the N-induced diversity loss. Nitrogen addition and clipping caused changes in community diversity were mainly indirectly attributed to their effects on community functional composition, and the competitive ability of dominant species. Nitrogen increased the CWM of functional traits to improve the competitive ability of dominant species. In contrast, clipping influenced species diversity positively by decreasing CWMheight (P < 0.001), and also negatively by increasing CWMSLA (P < 0.001) and decreasing CV_NNDSLA (P < 0.05). Interacting with N addition, clipping resulted in a neutral effect on species diversity, because clipping could offset the negative effects of nitrogen addition through an opposite effect on CWMheight. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of diversity maintenance with respect to nitrogen addition and clipping. Thus, clipping is recommended as a useful management strategy to alleviate the species loss caused by nutrients enrichment and maintain the diversity of grassland ecosystems.",W4220829088,True,0.952218770980835
https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2020.566964,Nocturnal Bees Feed on Diurnal Leftovers and Pay the Price of Day – Night Lifestyle Transition,"1. Bees exemplify flights under bright sunlight. A few species across bee families have evolved nocturnality, displaying remarkable adaptations to overcome limitations of their daylight-suited apposition eyes. Phase inversion to nocturnality in a minority of bees that co-exist with diurnal bees provide a unique opportunity to study ecological benefits that mediate total temporal niche shifts. While floral traits and sensory modalities associated with the evolution of classical nocturnal pollination syndromes, e.g. by bats and moths, are well-studied, nocturnality in bees represent a poorly understood, recently invaded, extreme niche. 2. To test the competitive release hypothesis, we examine how nocturnality shapes foraging by comparing pollen loads, nest pollen and flower visitation of sympatric nocturnal and diurnal carpenter bees. We predicted that nocturnal bees primarily use night-blooming flowers, show little/no resource overlap with diurnal species and competitive release favours night-time pollen collection for provisioning. 3. Contrarily, we found substantial resource overlap between nocturnal and diurnal bees. Flower opening times, floral longevity and plant abundance did not define nocturnal flower use. Smaller pollen loads on nocturnal foragers suggests subsistence on resource leftovers largely from diurnal flowers. Greater pollen types/diversity on nocturnal foragers indicates lower floral constancy compared to diurnal congenerics. Reduced activity during new moon compared to full moon suggests constraints to nocturnal foraging. 4. Invasion and sustenance within the nocturnal niche is characterised by: i)opportunistic foraging on residual resources as indicated by smaller pollen loads, extensive utilisation of day-blooming flowers and substantial overlap with diurnal bees, ii)generalisation at two levels – between and within foraging trips as indicated by lower floral constancy, iii)reduced foraging on darker nights, indicating visual constraints despite sensitive optics. This together with smaller populations and univoltine breeding in nocturnal compared to multivoltine diurnal counterparts, suggest that nocturnality imposes substantial fitness costs. 5. In conclusion, the evolution of nocturnality in bees is accompanied by resource generalisation instead of specialisation. Reduced floral constancy suggests differences in foraging strategies of nocturnal and diurnal bees which merits further investigation. The relative roles of competition, floral rewards and predators should be examined to fully understand the evolution and maintenance of nocturnality in bees.",W3096976254,True,0.9770362377166748
https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.17163,The <i>Ecology Underground</i> coalition: building a collaborative future of belowground ecology and ecologists,"Rising to meet global, interconnected challenges, such as food security and ecosystem resilience to global change, requires insights from across the Earth. This is especially true for belowground terrestrial ecological processes. Soil ecologists have answered this call: like mushrooms, large global datasets and databases on soil physics, chemistry and ecology are sprouting up everywhere (e.g. Fine-Root Ecology Database (Iversen et al., 2018), FunFun (Zanne et al., 2020), GlobalFungi (Větrovský et al., 2020), COntinuous SOil REspiration (Jian et al., 2020), Global distribution of earthworm diversity (Philips et al., 2019) etc.). It is now time to leverage synergies among these datasets to link the continuum of belowground processes to ecosystem functions (e.g. decomposition, nutrient cycling and soil respiration). Built on interdisciplinary and international collaborations, data synthesis that leads to a holistic understanding is one of the best ways of predicting the future of terrestrial ecosystems and for preserving ecosystem services under global change. In 2020, global interconnectedness was on display as we saw a pandemic sweep across the world in weeks. The pandemic allowed the Ecological Society of America (ESA) to enter a new digital era by holding a fully virtual conference. While technology cannot yet replicate all aspects of an in-person conference, the virtual platform increased accessibility and reduced the climate impact of the annual conference. It also provided an opportunity for early-career plant and microbial ecologists from five ESA Organized Oral Sessions and one Inspire Session to organize Ecology Underground, a two-day program of live virtual talks and open discussions on integrative belowground ecology on 4 and 5 August 2020. Ecology Underground was sponsored by New Phytologist, the ESA Soil Ecology Section, the US Department of Energy, Biological and Environmental Research program and the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), and gathered 453 participants over two days. The online platform allowed for participation across the globe (37 countries were represented; Fig. 1) and was an opportunity to think creatively about how scientific discussions and global collaborations can take place, now and in the future. Dr Bala Chaudhary (DePaul University, IL, USA) opened Ecology Underground with her vision for the future of soil ecology and soil researchers (see her full talk here: The discussion that followed her presentation focused on the importance of building comprehensive trait databases and of promoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). Building broad and inclusive communities not only increases geographic and organismal coverage of belowground ecological databases, but also creates synergies among diverse viewpoints, perspectives, and ways of thinking. For the remainder of Ecology Underground, scientists from across the globe discussed: (1) linkages among climate and microbial community and ecosystem processes in light of rapid evolution, community assembly, trait-based models and eco-evolutionary dynamics; (2) integration of microbe- and plant-focused studies to understand ecosystem responses to drought; (3) the availability of large soil datasets and how they can be applied to create mechanistic, process-based ecosystem models; (4) new methods and conceptual frameworks in root trait research; (5) expanding root trait research to understudied areas (e.g. the tropics); and (6) broadening the root economic spectrum by taking into account fungal traits. The discussions from the six sessions of Ecology Underground highlighted three broad areas of synergy across these different topics. 'Wouldn't it be amazing if we could predict belowground processes from drones and satellites aboveground by understanding linkages among leaf, wood, root, and microbial traits?' Colleen Iversen Trait-based approaches are an alternative to species-based approaches and place the emphasis on functional traits rather than species identities. This provides a framework for understanding how organisms affect ecosystem processes and community dynamics, by integrating functional information across species, space and time (Suding & Goldstein, 2008). Ecology Underground identified two overarching goals in applying trait-based approaches to both plant roots and free-living soil microbes: (1) identify critical functional traits driving ecosystem processes, and (2) identify trait trade-offs that help to better model these processes, (Fig. 2). Within each of these goals there remain challenges specific to belowground trait-based ecology, since lessons from aboveground trait-based ecology and resource economics theory may not be directly translatable to plant roots and soil microbes due to competition between trade-offs and environmental constraints. Ecology Underground identified three trait characteristics which hold promise for assessing and modeling responses of free-living microbes to changing environments: (1) traits that can be predicted from community properties or community membership (Fig. 2; Hall et al., 2018); (2) traits that can cause changes in resource allocation in response to environmental changes and selective pressures, such as how experimental warming shifts fungal resource allocation from decay to cell metabolic maintenance (Romero-Olivares et al., 2019); and (3) traits that underpin ecological guilds or strategies, such as cellulose decomposition or stress tolerance (Zanne et al., 2020). Phylogenetic signals or genome exploration for gene-level traits can be helpful for identifying traits in organisms with no cultures and unknown function. Nonetheless, it is important to pursue phylogenetically independent approaches which have proven useful for the exploration of bacterial functional trait trade-offs (e.g. evolutionary trade-off between recalcitrant carbon use and the tolerance of low nitrogen conditions; Treseder et al., 2011). Extending fine-root trait measurements from relatively-easily measured morphological traits to include additional trait categories is key to a better understanding of belowground plant resource acquisition strategies and their relationship to ecosystem processes (Freschet et al., 2020b). Therefore, efforts should be made to investigate (4) fine-root system traits, such as fine-root mass fraction and rooting distribution (Fig. 2), and (5) traits that fall into multiple categories including fine-root dynamics (e.g. phenology), physiology (e.g. exudation, enzymatic activity), biochemistry (e.g. phosphorus content), or anatomy (e.g. cortex : stele ratio) and traits associated with mycorrhizal fungi such as mycorrhizal type, mycorrhizal colonization intensity, the exploration type of ectomycorrhizal fungi, and hyphal branching. In order to mechanistically model plant and microbial mediation of global change on ecosystem processes, we must identify key relationships between plant and microbial traits. A first step is to estimate the associated costs of both plant and microbial traits and quantify the strength of their synergies and trade-offs, such as those between stress resistance and resource acquisition (e.g. between osmolyte production for drought resistance and enzyme production for organic matter decomposition). Second, it is necessary to consider the nature of the environment (e.g. constant vs fluctuating; Rodríguez-Verdugo et al., 2019) and biotic interactions (e.g. positive and negative interactions; Lee et al., 2019). In turn, relationships between fine-root functional traits have proven useful for defining plant acquisition strategies belowground. Some key frontiers in this area of research include: (1) integrating root economics with root evolution (Valverde-Barrantes et al., 2020); (2) identifying trade-offs between fine-root and mycorrhizal fungal traits and the emergent traits from their partnerships (McCormack & Iversen, 2019); (3) adopting a whole plant perspective (Weemstra et al., 2020); and (4) exploring patterns of intraspecific root and fungal trait variations (Defrenne et al., 2019). These frontiers will be crossed as we start linking root and fungal trait databases, create new databases (TraitAM, Chaudhary et al., 2020), develop novel techniques for the study of fine roots (Rhizovision, Seethepalli et al., 2020; EnRoot, Arnaud et al., 2019) and standardize root classification, sampling, processing and trait measurements (Freschet et al., 2020a). 'We need big datasets to cross from microbiological process to macro-ecological pattern.' Colin Averill Integrating below-ground processes into Earth system models and ecological forecasts requires a better understanding of the spatial and temporal consistency and turnover in microbial communities and fine-root distribution and dynamics. Recently, the development of microbial habitat maps at the global scale (Stephanie Kivlin, University of Tennessee, USA) and the use of networks of observation sites revealed helpful ways to bridge the gap between belowground processes and macro-ecological patterns. For instance, leveraging the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) enabled a better understanding of aerial arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal dispersal (Chaudhary et al., 2020) and the linking of rooting depth and soil nutrient distribution at the continental scale (Mingzhen Lu, Princeton University, NJ, USA). In turn, the use of the International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests (ICP Forests) made the exploration of microbial signatures at macro-ecological scales possible because it enabled pairing observations of forest growth with those of forest microbiome composition and processes (nitrogen-to-carbon metabolism; Colin Averill, ETH Zürich, Switzerland). Global biogeographical patterns appear to differ for soil invertebrates vs soil microbes, and we therefore need to examine them separately (Cameron et al., 2019). We also cannot assume that protecting aboveground organisms will be effective in protecting soil biodiversity since there is a substantial mismatch in terms of where species richness is highest for aboveground biodiversity and invertebrate soil biodiversity (Cameron et al., 2019). Furthermore, there are still large spatial and taxonomic gaps in our knowledge of soil invertebrate diversity, which introduces bias into macroecological studies (Guerra et al., 2020). Accounting for temporal variation in fine-root traits is crucial for a better understanding of belowground carbon allocation and root-fungal resource acquisition strategies. For example, shifts in root production, mortality and/or phenology: (1) informed the belowground responses to warming and hurricanes (Daniela Yaffar, Oak Ridge National laboratory, TN, USA); (2) informed mangrove responses to reforestation (Marie Arnaud, University of Leeds, UK); and (3) significantly affected the total vegetation carbon simulated by the land model portion of E3SM (Energy Exascale Earth System Model; Daniel Ricciuto, Oak Ridge National Laboratory). However, we need better empirical data to identify tractable ways of modeling fine-root phenology (Luke McCormack, Morton Arboretum, IL, USA). Temporal scaling of microorganisms also seems to be more complex than originally estimated (Kivlin et al., 2020) and it requires studies which will examine responses in relation to climatic history and current variation. For instance, precipitation variation on decadal time frames can influence drought responses in plants and microbes (Knapp et al., 2020; Veach & Zeglin, 2020). Understanding how previous environmental conditions influence ecosystem responses to disturbance is critical in the design of experiments over relevant time scales to accurately predict future ecosystem responses to climate change. Another key challenge is to understand microbial evolution and adaptation rates in the field and to better link these data to data from laboratories. To achieve this goal, we need to study the physical and climatic conditions that microbes truly experience at the micro-scale (Hall et al., 2018). Furthermore, little is known about the relative contributions of processes such as mutation and migration, or changes in the frequency of taxa or alleles that drive microbial trait variation. Efforts should be made to identify scales of variation (e.g. molecular, population, community) at which these processes operate and drive ecosystem processes (Alexander Chase, University of California, USA). 'We have decent maps of the stars in the universe; it is about time we have decent maps of microbes in our own soils.' Stephanie Kivlin Meeting the grand challenge of improving the conceptualization of microbes and plant roots in terrestrial biosphere models (modules of Earth System Models; Fig. 3, Ex III) requires that we generate trait-based ecological information belowground. This information is essential to inform inputs of models operating at different spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, the use of models which represent multiple scales is critical to bridge the gap between soil ecological observations at locations across the globe and biosphere model predictions. Model selection depends on the question of interest (Fig. 3, Ex I–III) and determines the type of empirical data needed for model parameterization and validation. For example, individually based models can be used to test the outcome of interactions between microbial taxa (Allison et al., 2010), the effect of evolving microbial strains on local decomposition (Fig. 3, Ex I; Abs et al., 2020), or drought legacy in soil microbiomes (Steven Allison and Bin Wang, University of California, USA ). Biogeochemical models focus on highly-resolved biogeochemical cycling within an ecosystem and are therefore useful to investigate processes related to changes in soil carbon in response to environmental changes, for example by integrating microbial functional groups (MIcrobial-MIneral Carbon Stabilization (MIMICS) model; Wieder et al., 2015) or the protection of soil organic matter (Sulman et al., 2014). Eventually, emergent properties of biogeochemical models such as the decomposition rates of microbial functional groups may become inputs for terrestrial biosphere models, in which microbes are not explicitly represented (yet) and where fine-root traits (e.g. rooting depth distribution, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio) have fixed parameters across plant functional types (Iversen et al., 2017). Informing model input values and validating model outputs requires strong collaborations between modelers and empiricists. Modelers using individual-based models need empiricists to provide them with a simple framework for microbial traits, by, for example, linking microbial diversity and ecosystem processes (e.g. Mark Anthony and Colin Averill, ETH Zürich, Switzerland ) or connecting descriptive diversity patterns and community traits to community level functions (e.g. Romero-Olivares et al., 2019). Modelers also need empiricists to (1) pair measurements of interest with those that models require; for example, effort should be made to pair measurements of fine-root morphology and chemistry with fine-root function, and (2) provide them with microbial trait trade-offs or range limits for a given trait (Abs et al., 2020). Empirical data such as local carbon dioxide emissions or community-level microbial biomass can be important to validate the emergent properties of individual-based models while measurements such as ecosystem-level net primary production or soil decomposition rates over time in long-term warming experiments (Melillo et al., 2017) or nitrogen addition experiments (Morrison et al., 2018), can be needed to validate biogeochemical model outputs. Lastly, terrestrial biosphere models require large scale data (e.g. the Harmonized World Soil Database, FAO, 2012) and/or emergent properties from biogeochemical models for both model parameterization and model evaluation or validation. However, caution should be used when relying on inverse modeling (i.e. tuning models to match large scale data) because important fine-scale mechanisms may be overlooked. 'We cannot perform global ecology without embracing the diversity of scientists around the globe.' Bala Chaudhary The events that occurred in May and June 2020 in the USA and around the world (e.g. the murder of George Floyd, Black Lives Matter marches and demonstrations, #BlackInTheIvory, #ShutDownSTEM, #ShutDownAcademia, etc.) called new attention to the need for anti-racism in STEM. Recent efforts towards promoting Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) in STEM include: (1) encouraging the scientific community to build anti-racist labs (Chaudhary & Berhe, 2020); (2) promoting Black excellence in ecology and evolution (Schell et al., 2020); (3) helping BIPOC students to engage in conservation science (Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program at the University of Washington); and (4) supporting scientists who self-identify as women of color and work in ecology, evolutionary biology or allied fields (e.g. WOCinEEB slack online community, created by Bala Chaudhary, wocineeb@gmail.com; or Halsey et al., 2020). These efforts are necessary because BIPOC are underrepresented in environmental fields worldwide (e.g. Taylor, 2015) despite demonstrating high environmental concern and having strong motivations such as achieving ecological and social well-being in their communities (Tania Schusler, Loyola University of Chicago, IL, USA). Science and equity are interdependent – research shows more diverse groups produce more novel ideas (Hofstra et al., 2020), therefore, scientific communities should be diverse at all levels (e.g. students, early-career researchers, faculty members). In addition, actions promoting DEI should primarily be carried out by people in power such as faculty members and leaders, and the onus should not be on graduate students or BIPOC themselves, although their contributions should be welcomed and valued. To value the scientific expertise and important perspectives of PEERs' (Persons Excluded because of their Ethnicity or Race), departments must actively support them speaking about their science as well as their experiences navigating STEM and support them serving on both scientific and diversity committees. In order to increase DEI in STEM, one can create new programs that integrate science and DEI or create new funding opportunities that specifically require applicants to integrate science and DEI. Furthermore, organizations should be intentional about recruiting BIPOC students and faculty members instead of simply removing 'roadblocks' such as application fees. Similarly, they must be intentional about supporting the people they recruit such as taking steps to create communities of BIPOC, and hiring BIPOC in clusters to avoid feelings of isolation and exclusion in white-dominated spaces. Lastly, future events would be greatly improved if organizers: (1) have conversations about DEI early and throughout the process to ensure that the team has a shared knowledge and vision, and can act on that vision throughout the organizing process; (2) include PEERs co-organizers and speakers as this would help create synergies among ways of thinking (e.g. Hagan et al., 2020); and (3) encourage organizations to advertise, including scientific societies focused on representing PEERs in STEM (e.g. Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics & Native Americans in Science – SACNAS). In a world of social distancing to slow the spread of a global pandemic, collaborative and critical scientific conversations can still happen via online meetings. Through two days of online synchronous presentations and discussion that leveraged sessions proposed within the ESA framework, Ecology Underground identified three critical areas of belowground ecology that need further research: (1) the use of trait-based approaches for linking plants, microbes, and ecosystem processes; (2) the identification of relevant spatial and temporal scales for studies in belowground ecology; and (3) the development of models that connect microscale dynamics to predict belowground processes globally. Advancement of these research areas will require strong global networks, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and a diversity of perspectives only achievable through a diverse community of ecologists. Creating such a community will require active work from people at all levels (students to tenured faculty members) to recruit, support and promote BIPOC and other historically excluded people in science. As ecologists, we know that diversity is essential to building resilient ecological communities. Applying the same principles to our community of scientists will surely lead us to new insights, better science, and a more vibrant research community.

https://doi.org/10.2307/3079226,Character Shifts of Prey Species That Share Predators,"This article uses several models to explore the potential indirect evolutionary interaction between two prey species that share one or more predator species. It asks how the antipredator adaptations of a focal prey species are likely to evolve following the introduction of a second prey species that shares one or more of the same predator species. The interactions are represented by differential equation models of homogeneous populations, and evolutionary change occurs in a single quantitative trait within each prey species. Models differ in assumptions about the number of predator types, the costs of antipredator traits, and in how predator and prey traits combine to determine a per capita capture rate. Parallel change in the antipredator characteristics of two species usually occurs when the general risk of predation is changed by the introduction of the second prey. This may be a parallel increase or decrease, depending on whether the ecological interaction is apparent competition or apparent mutualism. Divergence in trait values is most often associated with the presence of two or more distinct types of predators with some form of trade‐off in the prey’s ability to avoid different predators. Divergence may also occur with a single predator type, when two or more strategies exist for reducing predation risk. Convergence is a possible outcome when there are two or more predator types. Coevolution may also produce trait and population cycles in models, and the nature of character displacement is often changed markedly by such instability. The limited evidence for evolutionary indirect effects mediated by shared predation is reviewed. Possible reasons for the disparity between theory and observation are discussed.",W3139733357,True,0.9768244624137878
https://doi.org/10.2307/2656802,"Clonal plant research: proliferation, integration, but not much evolution","The vast majority of plants are modular i.e., made up of reiterated pieces. Plant pieces also tend to be highly totipotent. You can regenerate a whole plant from just a tiny fragment of tissue. The ultimate elaboration of modularity and totipotency is clonal growth: one plant gives rise to another gives rise to another gives rise to another with no sex in between. A large proportion of plants possesses the capacity for clonal growth and, as a group, plants clone themselves in an intriguing variety of ways. Much of the recent fascination with clonal plants among botanists grew out of work by John Harper and colleagues in the 1970s (reviewed by Harper and White, 1974; Harper, 1978). During the decade that followed, other biologists joined Harper & co. in exploring the consequences of modularity for the ecology, and evolution of clonal plants, and animals (reviewed in Jackson, Buss, and Cook, 1985; Harper, Rosen, and White, 1986). From this activity, emerged a set of questions concerning morphology, physiology, ecology and evolution that continues to dominate current research on clonal plants, and has been pursued by a cosmopolitan but close-knit group of researchers. Since the late 1980s, clonal plant enthusiasts have met every two years or so at small workshops, the proceedings of which have been duly recorded in several volumes appearing as books (van Groenendael and de Kroon, 1990), special issues of journals (Callaghan et al., 1992) or both (Soukupova´ et al., 1994; Oborny and Podani, 1996). The Ecology and Evolution of Clonal Plants is the latest installment from the clonal plant cognoscenti. Like the four previous volumes, it is a compendium of review articles that, according to the editors (Hans de Kroon and Jan van Groenendael), ""demonstrates how elementary processes at the level of the individual, the population and the community are influenced by clonal growth."" My overall impression is that this is a fairly comprehensive and nicely put-together summary of contemporary research on clonal plants. Even though the book covers a lot of ground, from physiology and development to community ecology and global change, most of the chapters provide the general reader with sufficient background to appreciate why the questions at hand are important and to evaluate the progress made in addressing them. Each chapter ends with an extensive list of references so that the book, as a whole, provides a wide window on the diverse literature concerning clonal plants. This book would make an excellent starting point for a graduate-level course on clonal plants. In this way, it may ultimately fulfill one of the editors' major objectives: to make the interesting things that clonal plants do ""more widely appreciated in future studies"" at the various levels of biological organization. It is somewhat unusual that The Ecology and Evolution of Clonal Plants was published on the heels of four other edited volumes that have appeared at regular intervals over the last ten years. In addition, all these volumes have involved many of the same authors. At least one author on 15 of the 18 chapters in this recent book has also authored a chapter in one of the previous volumes, usually on the same general topic. What does this proliferation of review articles mean? How distinct is this most recent volume from previous efforts? In reviewing this book, I have used these four previous volumes as a kind of fossil record to gauge how quickly this field is evolving. Below, I discuss a sample of chapters from this new book in terms of what questions are being asked, what approaches are being used to answer them, and how the field of clonal plant research has progressed over the last decade. Much of the interest in clonal plants focuses on how their pattern of development influences the way they grow, how they capture resources, and how they respond to environmental variation in space and time. Six of the 18 chapters in this book address these general questions from a variety of angles. Watson, Hay, and Newton discuss how the developmental program of clonal plants can be understood in terms of meristem demography (i.e., meristem birth, death, dormancy, and allocation to growth vs. reproduction). The demographic properties of meristems may, in turn, influence how clonal genotypes (genets) respond to environmental heterogeneity. The meristem perspective is closely related to the large body of work on module demography by Harper and his students (reviewed by Harper, 1978), and has been promoted for some time by Watson and others (e.g., Watson, 1984; White, 1984; Fagerstro¨m, 1992; Bonser and Aarssen, 1996). This chapter summarizes a fair bit of previous work on water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and describes some recently published data on mayapple (Podophyllum peltatum). Watson et al. argue that meristem demography will strongly influence the persistence and proliferation of ramets and genets in natural populations. Accordingly, they urge the reader to ""move away from the notion that sexual reproduction is the primary means by which clonal plants achieve fitness"" and embrace the view that ""ramet persistence and the success of clones at generating new ramets need to be considered as equally important elements in estimations of clonal fitness"". This statement puts clonal propagation on the same level as sexual reproduction in terms of the transmission of genes over evolutionary time: a rather controversial position (see, for example, Mogie, 1992, pp. 4–15). I agree that the rate and mode of clonal spread will influence fitness, but I am not fully convinced by Watson et al.'s argument that clonal growth is a means of achieving fitness. Much depends on the evolutionary dynamics of the species in question. For example, rapid clonal spread may strongly enhance the representation of genotypes within individual populations, but may be of less importance in the long term if populations undergo frequent extinction and recolonization via seed. At this point we do not know enough to say whether a ramet- or meristem-based definition of clonal fitness will really improve our understanding of microevolution in clonal plants. One of the most significant and widely investigated characteristics of clonal plants is that the component ramets that make up a genet may be physiologically integrated and share resources. Marshall and Price review how experiments involving radioactive tracers and selective defoliation, the mainstay techniques in this field, are used to define the extent of ""integrated physiological units"" and to help understand how morphology influences physiological integration. This chapter is a good review, but does not present much in the way of new ideas and data. Most of the chapter goes over the same ground reviewed by Price and Hutchings (1992), and features data previously presented by Price and Hutchings (1992) and Kemball and Marshall (1995). Jo´nsdo´ttir and Watson approach clonal integration by defining the potential for physiological integration in terms of three variables: ramet longevity, ramet generation time, and the longevity of physical connections between ramets. A factorial combination of these variable results in five potential categories of plants that differ in the size of connected ramet networks and the extent to which the ramet network is physiologically integrated. A new comparative analysis that places 51 species in these five categories suggests that the maintenance of large, integrated ramet networks is most common in plants inhabiting stable but resource-poor habitats, although this result may be weakened by potentially confounding correlations between clonal mode, habitat type, and phylogenetic relatedness. The adaptive significance of physiological integration in resource-poor environments is further explored by comparing Jo´nsdo´ttir's previously published data on 14C translocation in Carex bigelowii with new data from Podophyllum peltatum. This is a difficult problem to tackle experimentally. Reduced growth of individual ramets and whole genets has been observed after connections between ramets are experimentally severed. However, this experimental approach focuses on the advantages of clonal integration but does not assess the risks and costs of maintaining physiological connections between ramets. These costs would seem much more difficult to quantify. It is clear from these chapters that the extent to which ramets are physiologically integrated varies markedly between species, yet very few species have been studied in much detail. Later on in the book, the reader is told that many important consequences of clonal growth for population and community dynamics depend on the degree of clonal integration. The difficulty of making generalizations about the nature of integration within genets is likely to hinder the interpretation of patterns and processes in clonal populations and communities. Consider a clonal plant that maintains physiological connections between ramets in a patchy environment. Some ramets wind up in patches with an abundance of one resource, whereas others are in spots where a complementary resource is abundant. If the resource-extraction activities of ramets could be co-ordinated, the genet as a whole could benefit from different ramets acquiring different locally abundant resources and then sharing them with each other. Alpert and Stuefer develop the idea of division of labor in clonal plants by analogy with division of labor in human economic systems. The analogy results in a particularly clear definition of the problem. Division of labor in clonal plants requires that: (1) Ramets share resources. (2) Individual ramets allocate most effort to extracting resources that are most abundant to them rather than scarce resources that would limit their growth if they were not connected to other ramets. (3) Genets benefit more from resource sharing when individual ramets specialize on locally abundant resources. In other words, there should be a positive interaction between resource sharing and specialization. They go on to present fairly convincing published and unpublished evidence for (1) and (2) and discuss the need for future work on (3). They also outline the various risks and costs of maintaining division of labor, most of which depend on ecological factors such as disturbance and pathogens. Confirming that division of labor is adaptive will require some highly controlled experiments, the results of which will ultimately have to be validated in the highly uncontrolled world of real habitat. How clonal plants spread in space and whether their meandering through heterogeneous environments can be viewed as ""foraging"" have received considerable attention. Oborny and Cain review the various theoretical approaches used to study the spread of clonal genets in relation to environmental heterogeneity. Although this seems to be an active area of research, these authors dwell extensively on previously reviewed material. In fact, the four figures they present are recycled directly from reviews published in previous books on clonal plants (Sutherland and Stillman, 1990; Oborny, 1994; Cowie, Watkinson, and Sutherland 1996). Populations and communities of clonal plants may often consist of complex networks of ramets that are physiologically integrated to some extent. Four chapters explore how these aspects of clonal growth affect the nature of intraspecific and interspecific interactions. Van der Hoeven and During review a substantial body of experimental work with mosses that investigates the interactions between shoots and the mechanisms that regulate shoot densities (see also During, 1990). While there seems to be good evidence for positive interactions between shoots leading to facilitation in moss populations, most of this chapter has relatively little to do with clonal growth per se. Because clonal propagation in mosses occurs primarily through ramet fragmentation and the production of specialized asexual propagules, there is little opportunity for physiological integration among ramets and, thus, higher order effects of clonal growth. The development of size hierarchies in plant populations and self-thinning are central issues in plant population ecology. Suzuki and Hutchings explore how clonal growth affects these processes. Clonal plants may differ in terms of shoot dynamics from widely studied annual plants because large quantities of resources are often stored in perennating organs, and clonal integration may allow internal control of shoot proliferation. The authors review empirical and theoretical evidence that resource storage reduces self-thinning in clonal populations. However, as the authors point out, resource storage also occurs in non-clonal perennials. Whether there are specific consequences of clonal growth (i.e., internal control) remains unclear. Clonal growth adds an extra dimension to competition in plant communities because clonal plants not only compete for resources via overtopping and root competition, but also compete for space through clonal expansion. Space invasion may, in turn, be facilitated by physiological integration among ramets: connected ramets can support one another while battling neighbors. Herben and Hara explore the consequences of clonal growth for interspecific competition. They begin by discussing the relative importance of founder control vs. dominance control in determining the outcome of experimental two-species interactions (see also Herben, 1996), move through how modeling might link ramet-level processes to community dynamics, and end by considering the factors that affect species coexistence in communities where clonal plants are common. Given the limited data on mechanisms of clonal integration in individual species (see above), it is no surprise that hypotheses far outnumber conclusions at the community level. In the last chapter dealing with the consequences of clonal growth for community-level interactions, de Kroon and Bobbink review both published and unpublished case studies to fuel some informed speculation on why atmospheric deposition of nitrogen in many areas of western Europe has been associated with increasing dominance by clonal species. They hypothesize that clonal plants compete effectively under high nutrient conditions by sequestering nitrogen in well-developed storage organs, and rapidly preempting space via clonal spread. However, this chapter is reminiscent of many other efforts to identify general characteristics of invasive or aggressive species; no hard and fast rules emerge. Because clonal spread results in the proliferation of genetically identical ramets and is often associated with a low frequency of sexual recruitment, clonal growth may directly affect the distribution of phenotypic and genetic variation within and among populations, and, ultimately, how populations evolve. The four chapters that explore the evolutionary implications of clonal growth were of particular interest to me. However, I found them largely lacking in terms of new ideas or critical analysis of old ideas. McLellan, Prati, Kaltz, and Schmid provide a wide-ranging review of the population-genetic consequences of clonal growth. They begin by discussing some of the technical and statistical issues that complicate the analysis of allelic vs. genotypic diversity in clonal populations, go on to review the limited work on how clonal growth affects the amount and structuring of genetic variation within and among populations, and end by discussing what little is known about the extent to which genetic diversity in clonal populations is maintained by various factors, including sporadic sexual recruitment, frequency-dependent selection involving pathogens, environmental heterogeneity, somatic mutation, and gene flow. There are gaping holes in our knowledge of the evolutionary genetics of clonal plants. Although McLellan et al. do an excellent job of identifying the questions that warrant serious attention, their review touches on too many things to critically dissect any particular issue. For instance, they reiterate one of the most widely cited conclusions from population-genetic studies of clonal plants: ""on average, clonal plants do not seem to be genetically less variable than non-clonal plants"" (see also Ellstrand and Roose, 1987; Hamrick and Godt, 1990; Wide´n, Cronberg, and Wide´n, 1994). While I agree that the old notion of clonal monomorphism has rightly fallen by the wayside, no one has attempted a rigorous comparison of genetic structure in obligately sexual perennials vs. perennials where sexual recruitment is extremely limited (i.e., what the authors of this volume typically view as clonal plants). Moreover, there have been relatively few studies that have exploited intraspecific variation in reproductive mode (i.e., clonal vs. sexual) to more directly investigate how clonal growth affects genetic structure. It seems that our efforts to understand how clonal growth affects genetic diversity has focussed too closely on average levels of diversity and ignored the repeated observation that clonal species exhibit particularly wide variation in genetic structure among populations. For instance, data on genotypic diversity within populations of 32 predominantly clonal species summarized by Wide´n, Cronberg, and Wide´n (1994) indicate that single-genotype populations occur along with genotypically diverse populations in more than a dozen species. What are the ecological and evolutionary causes and consequences of this variation? In many species, the relative importance of clonal vs. sexual recruitment may be influenced strongly by environmental factors. As a result, populations at the periphery of a species' geographical range may contain relatively little genotypic diversity, thereby limiting the potential for evolutionary expansion of the species' distribution. McLellan et al. emphasize the lack of data on how clonal growth affects the spatial distribution of genotypes and alleles within populations. However, they do not clearly indicate why this is an interesting question. Yet, the spatial dispersion of clones within a population may have several significant consequences. For example, localized clonal spread may interfere with sexual reproduction by reducing pollen transfer and mating between genets (Handel, 1985). High levels of between-ramet self-pollination (geitonogamy) may have a major impact on the evolution of the breeding system (e.g., Harder and Barrett, 1996). The breeding system may, in turn, impose selective pressures on clonal growth form (Silander, 1985). However, there has been almost no effort to quantify the effect of different modes of clonal growth on the mating system, or to investigate whether plants with different breeding systems possess different modes of clonal growth. Extensive clonal growth may affect the evolution of life history traits in a variety of ways. Ove Eriksson explores the evolution of seed dispersal and recruitment in clonal populations. Experimental and comparative evidence suggests that the evolution of seed size and dispersal behavior is influenced by when seed recruitment occurs during the history of a population. If recruitment is restricted to the time when a population is founded, small dispersible seeds should be favored. If recruitment occurs infrequently but repeatedly throughout the life span of a population, large competitive seeds should be favored. Eriksson has been developing this idea for about a decade. This chapter presents a bit of new empirical data and minor refinements to the general hypothesis, but no new conclusions or predictions. The evolution of seed recruitment and dispersal in clonal populations has recently been examined in the context of metapopulation dynamics (Olivieri, Michalakis, and Gouyon, 1995; Piquot et al., 1998). Cycles of colonization and extinction are strongly implied in Eriksson's model, and it would have been nice to see a link developed between these two theoretical approaches. Eriksson's hypothesis assumes that there is a trade-off between sexual reproduction and clonal growth. This notion is discussed in passing several times throughout the book but is never dealt with directly. The cost of sexual reproduction in terms of reduced survival and growth is a major issue in life-history theory. However, determining the nature of the cost is often complicated because the expected genetic trade-off between sexual reproduction and growth may be obscured by positive phenotypic correlations: vigorous individuals do everything well (Roff, 1992). Clonal plants offer excellent opportunities for investigating life-history trade-offs because individual genotypes may be replicated and then subjected to various treatments in an array of experimental environments. Clonal growth may influence the long-term evolution of life history by affecting the accumulation of mutations. Klekowski discusses this idea with respect to his ""somatic mutation theory of clonality."" He argues that, in the absence of sexual recombination, genetic diversity in clonal populations is generated through somatic mutation. As clones age and spread they are likely to accumulate deleterious mutations; a process similar to the mutational meltdown in asexual populations envisioned by Michael Lynch and co-workers (e.g., Lynch et al., 1993). However, mutation-selection balance in highly clonal populations is expected to allow the build-up of mutational load that specifically impairs sexual reproduction, because the processes involved in sex contribute little to the fitness of genets. This is analogous to the loss of eyes and pigments in cave-dwelling organisms (Fong, Kane, and Culver, 1995), a case of ""use it or lose it."" This hypothesis might explain the many observations of infrequent sexual reproduction in highly clonal populations (e.g., Sculthorpe, 1967). Yet, the somatic mutation theory of clonality has received little empirical investigation (Eckert, Dorken, and Mitchell, 1999). In fact, few studies have even determined the extent to which low seed production in clonal populations is due to genetic vs. environmental factors. The lack of attention to this hypothesis has always seemed strange to me, as Klekowski has published a lot of interesting work on this subject (e.g., Klekowski, 1988). Because this chapter only scratches the surface of his previous work and does not present any substantially new thinking on the topic, it may not generate new interest in the long-term evolutionary interactions among clonal reproduction, mutation, and sexual reproduction. Somatic mutation is repeatedly invoked as a source of genetic variation in clonal populations, yet there has been little or no effort to directly quantify the rate at which somatic mutation generates variation. McLellan et al. suggest that ""it would be interesting to produce genetically homogeneous populations of clonal plants by vegetative reproduction or by selection and then follow the reappearance of heritable variation in the subsequent generations of sexually and vegetatively produced offspring."" Unfortunately, they do not indicate how many generations it might take until the variation created by somatic mutation might be experimentally detectable, the sample sizes required, or how one might compare the amount of heritable variation between sexually- and clonally-produced offspring. Because clonal genotypes are represented by multiple ramets, phenotypic variation and genetic variation are organized hierarchically at the population level. There may be heritable differences in fitness at the ramet and genet level that arise from variation in the performance of individual ramets as well as higher order differences in fitness among genets that arise from genet-level characteristics (e.g., ramet number and density). Vuorisalo, Tuomi, Pedersen, and Ka¨a¨r present a statistical model for quantifying phenotypic selection in hierarchically structured populations. This is an important problem that challenges some fundamental notions about the operation of natural selection in clonal populations. However, it is a complex problem that is unlikely to attract much attention unless rendered in an accessible way. This chapter succeeds to some extent in this regard, because it boils down their previously published model into a more accessible format and illustrates how the model might be used with data on the factors affecting fruit dispersal in Podophyllum peltatum. Determining the spatial boundaries of individual genets has long been one of the most vexing problems for workers interested in clonal plants. In the last five years, ecologists and evolutionary biologists have gained access to a wide variety of new, highly variable PCR-based genetic markers, such as RAPDs, ISSRs, AFLPs, SSCPs, and microsatellites, which greatly increase our ability to unambiguously identify individual genets. McLellan et al. briefly mention these new markers, but do not delve into how we might use them in novel ways. For example, a combination of chloroplast and nuclear markers could be used to quantify the relative importance of sexual reproduction and recruitment vs. gene flow in maintaining genotypic diversity in clonal populations. Sex would tend to break down disequilibrium between markers, whereas gene flow (without subsequent sex) would tend to increase it. A chapter exploring the new uses and potential pitfalls of PCR markers would have made a nice addition to this book, especially considering the profound implications of this technology for research on clonal plants. Probably the most overarching evolutionary question involving clonal plants concerns the adaptive significance of clonal growth itself. Various chapters in this book briefly touch on the fitness benefits of clonal growth, especially with respect to spatial heterogeneity of resource abundance and risk-spreading. However, no one chapter presents a comprehensive evolutionary analysis. This is a difficult question because, among species, clonal growth happens in many different ways and is, therefore, likely to be associated with diverse costs and benefits (e.g., multiplication of ramets, dispersal, resource acquisition, anchorage, storage; Grace, 1993). Given this diversity, a combination of experimental and comparative studies would seem most effective. Judging from the chapters in this book, there seem to be little experimental investigation of the costs and benefits of clonal growth. Experimental work would be greatly facilitated by intraspecific variation in one or more of the parameters that define clonal growth (e.g., Jo´nsdo´ttir and Watson's three variables relating to clonal integration, see above). For example, Watson, Hay, and Newton briefly mention variation in the rate of ramet production among genotypes of Eichhornia crassipes. However, this kind of variation is clearly underexploited. Klimeš, Klimeš;t1ova´, Hendriks, and van Groenendael use a comparative analysis to ask whether clonal growth is more common in some types of habitats than others or is associated with particular life history traits. This chapter is an expanded version of a chapter that appeared in another recent edited volume (van Groenendael et al., 1997; see Mazer, 1998, for a critical review). In an attempt to organize the diversity of ways in which plants clone themselves, the authors come up with a rather cumbersome taxonomy of clonal growth modes that consists of 21 categories, each typified by a particular species (some of which may not be familiar to the North American readers). They go on to categorize the mode of clonal growth as well as ecological and life-history characteristics for 2760 plant species in central Europe. Using species as independent data points, they show that clonal plants are less likely to self-fertilize, or be pollinated by insects than non-clonal plants, and are disproportionately common in cool, moist or low-nutrient environments. They explore the extent to which phylogenetic history influences these associations between ecology, life history and clonal growth by repeating the analyses at the family level. Families were mapped on to a DNA-based phylogeny of the seed plants, and correlations between family means for ecological and life history characters and the proportion of species in each family exhibiting clonal growth were tested using phylogenetically-independent contrasts. These analyses confirmed some of the species-level results but not others. Yet, it is not clear how we should reconcile the differences between the species-level and ""phylogenetically-correct"" analyses. Family-level averages for ecological and life history traits may be relatively meaningless if there is broad variation within families. The species- and family-level patterns detected also do not lend themselves to any clear evolutionary interpretation because the authors only report univariate analyses. As with most univariate analyses of multiple trait-environment and trait-trait correlations, it is often impossible to determine which associations represent adaptations and which arise indirectly from intercorrelations between various environmental and life history characteristics (i.e., multiple colinearity). If you are a newcomer to the world of clonal plants, The Ecology and Evolution of Clonal Plants will serve as a excellent introduction to the many interesting issues surrounding the mechanisms and consequences of clonal growth. Although this book is preceded by four similar edited volumes published during the last decade, it is probably the most comprehensive review of clonal plant research to date. Unlike the previous books, it is produced and distributed by a publisher who has made it readily available to North American readers. However, if you have been closely following the literature on clonal plants and are looking for new ideas, this book may be less useful. It presents some new data plus refinements to existing hypotheses and approaches but does not contain much in the way of new breakthroughs. For the most part, this book represents the regular crowd asking the same questions in more or less the same way. After reading this book in the context of the four previous edited volumes, I began to see clonal plants as a metaphor for the field of research that seeks to understand them. There has been extensive proliferation of journal papers and review articles exploring various aspects of clonal growth. There has also been considerable integration between the workers in this field, even though they are scattered around the globe. Ideas have been extensively shared, and there seems to have been a lot of collaboration between workers interested in similar questions. However, the ideas and approaches in clonal plant research have not evolved much in the past decade. Hopefully, the solid summary of past progress provided by this book will serve as a launching pad for future innovation.",W2250077582,True,0.9274329543113708
https://doi.org/10.4161/cib.2.4.8612,Parasitoids use chemical footprints to track down caterpillars,"Parasitoid wasps in search for plant-feeding hosts display typical patterns of behavior. The braconid Cotesia marginiventris, which parasitizes young caterpillars, is guided by herbivore-induced plant volatiles to an infested plant. On the plant, the female wasp searches for further chemical residues (kairomones) originating directly from the host. We showed that caterpillars leave minute amounts of treacherous chemical footprints while walking over a plant surface. Female wasps are able to detect these residues for up to two days after their hosts have left the site. Analyses of the caterpillar footprints revealed that these consisted of linear and monomethyl-branched alkanes as well as few minor unidentified compounds. A reconstructed blend of the major footprint compounds, consisting of linear C(21)-C(32) alkanes, induced characteristic antennation behavior. However, the artificial blend was less attractive than the original one suggesting a role for additional minor compounds in recognizing former caterpillar presence. Previous investigations using wax mutants of barley showed that the physico-chemical traits of the epicuticular leaf wax can modulate the parasitoids' response to host footprints. We hypothesize that long-chain hydrocarbons of insect and plant cuticular origin are important mediators of insect-plant interactions and believe that their role in modulating trophic cascades still awaits full appreciation.",W2046621092,True,0.9786697626113892
https://doi.org/10.3732/ajb.1600265,Here come the commensals,"Metagenomic approaches to understanding microbial symbiont communities, the microbiome, have provided an unprecedented window into the diversity of microbial organisms associated with virtually all eukaryotic hosts. However, our ignorance of what these symbionts do has been illuminated as well. Nowhere is the contrast between what we know, and what we do not know, more starkly realized than in the Kingdom Fungi with descriptions of less than 5% of the estimated 1.5 to 5 million taxa (Blackwell, 2011). While there is delight in discovery, and fortitude in the face of the cryptic nature of fungal symbioses, understanding the diversity of ecological functions for fungal symbionts remains a formidable challenge. Here, I use endophytic fungi to draw attention to the particular conundrum of commensal symbionts, symbionts that seem to do little but likely make up most of the microbial communities occupying plant and animal hosts. Endophytic fungi are those symbionts living within healthy living tissues of plants (Wilson, 1995) and thus, in terms of their interactions with the host, are best considered commensals. H. Anton de Bary in 1878 put commensals squarely in the middle of the continuum of symbioses between beneficial mutualists and detrimental parasites because commensals have few apparent direct effects on their hosts (translation by Oulhen et al., 2016). Others have argued against typecasting commensal symbioses as those in which nothing happens (Hirsh and Fujishige, 2008) or those for which we do not know what happens (Zapalski, 2011). Here, I advocate for the perspective that the commensal symbiotic habit is critical to study because commensalism enables the evolution and maintenance of tremendous diversity in ecological functions. The pervasive assumption that microbiome symbionts, including endophytic fungi, must benefit the host echoes the ""balance of nature"" perspectives found in early theoretical and conceptual models for parasites and for microbiomes. For parasites, virulence was thought maladaptive because the host on which the microbe depends is damaged and evolution toward low virulence states was predicted (reviewed by Ewald, 1983). For the human microbiome, Henderson and Wilson (1998, p. 1680) posited that diverse microbial communities ""evolved cytokine-modulating molecules to live in harmony with host mucosal surfaces"" and envisioned the microbiome as a communistic collective. In contrast, modern theory predicts that competition for host resources among multiple infecting symbionts should drive the evolution of greater virulence toward the host (reviewed by Alizon et al., 2013). Limits to virulence arise from a trade-off between parasite reproduction and parasite-induced host mortality (Anderson and May, 1982). Still, with the explosion of research on the microbiome, the concept that the ""holobiont"" (host plus microbes) evolves as a superorganism has been strongly forwarded (Bordenstein and Theis, 2015) and actively debated (Moran and Sloan, 2015). One way out of this conceptual mess may come from results that suggest a very dynamic nature of microbiome communities (Burns et al., 2016) with relatively few taxa comprising a ""core microbiome"" (Douglas and Werren, 2016). Employing evolutionary models that bring in ""third party"" interactions, we might then predict that the ever-changing landscape of microbial symbionts drives the evolution of traits such as antagonism against microbial competitors. Further, if ecological outcomes are conditional on population history and the identity of interacting species, as seems to be the case for endophytic fungi (Busby et al., 2016b), tremendous variation in traits that affect these interactions can be maintained species-wide (Bronstein, 1994; Gomulkiewicz et al., 2003). For now, we might best assume that most symbiotic species of the microbiome muddle along, pulled in different directions by the ever-changing ecological context set up by the nature of the commensal habit. Occasionally, but importantly, commensals ""escape"" and evolve more extreme symbiotic modes toward the host—mutualism and parasitism. Although somewhat hampered by an apparent publication bias toward reporting beneficial effects, a recent review on endophytic fungi suggests that these symbionts harbor extensive variation in ecological functions, including facilitation, antagonism, and neutral effects on plant parasites (Busby et al., 2016b). To think about how such variation evolves while the commensal state is stable, consider first the results of a key paper that used uing ancestral state reconstruction to trace the evolution of trophic modes in ascomycete fungi (Arnold et al., 2009). One of the most interesting results of this work is the stability and prevalence of the endophytic and endolichenic (occupying lichens) trophic modes across the phylogeny. Of the relatively few transitions accounted, shifts between parasitic and endophytic/endolichenic states are most frequent, results echoing the early predictions of Carroll (1988). What then of the mutualistic functions for endophytes so often assumed in the literature? When we focus on traits for interactions with the enemies of plants, we find several lines of evidence suggesting that the endophytic fungi actually vary considerably in their effects on plant parasites and that these effects depend on the ecological context. For example, results for well-studied taxa such as Fusarium species have demonstrated variation within species and among closely related species in their effects on plant hosts, including commensalism, parasitism, defensive mutualism, and parasite facilitation (e.g., Kaldau and Yates, 2000). Recent experimental ecological studies reveal variation within and between endophytic taxa for antagonistic and facilitative effects on a pathogen, and surprisingly, many endophytic strains have no statistically discernable phenotype (Fig. 1; Busby et al., 2016a). While endophytic fungi provide novel sources of disease control for agriculture (Ledford, 2015), the emerging picture is that endophytic fungi are commensal with respect to direct effects on their host, while harboring tremendous genetic variation for ecological functions such as interactions with other symbionts. Fungi isolated as endophytes demonstrate varying effects on the disease severity caused by a fungal rust pathogen in poplar. Approximately half of the endophytes have no apparent effect (gray), a quarter increase disease severity (facilitation, blue), and a quarter decrease severity (antagonism, orange). Isolates within individual genera vary in their effects as illustrated here for Cladosporium, Alternaria, and Penicillium (adapted from results in fig. 2 of Busby et al., 2016a). To understand the evolution and maintenance of variation for symbiont interaction traits, we might productively consider an axis of symbiont function that is distinct from the traditional continuum from parasite to mutualist. Perhaps Henderson and Wilson (1998) had it right in their emphasis on the importance of community ecological context—the direct and indirect interactions among the ever-changing members of the symbiont community are a strong force in the maintenance of the commensal state and of genetic variation within populations for interactions among symbionts (May and Nelson, 2014). How might we move forward to address these questions? The dizzying array of -omic tools has allowed extraordinary assessment of what is there, and of their genomic functions, but also raised a thicket of data that may actually obscure our view of the evolutionary process. For example, while the number of sequence reads on tiny bits of the genome is broadly acknowledged as a poor estimator of a species' abundance, no other measures using metagenomics data alone are available. Rather than being consumed with the task of building bioinformatics pipelines to nowhere, we join with Peay (2014) in calling for research addressing the basic biology of organisms. In particular, reproduction is fundamental to both ecological and evolutionary models. However, sometimes we do not even know where symbiotic organisms reproduce and for cryptic microorganisms, life history traits can be difficult, but not impossible to estimate (Bruns et al., 2014). There is hope—many fungi are culturable with effort, and there is increasing interest in maintaining microbial culture collections as a basis for experimentation and taxonomic description (Bai et al., 2015). Consequently, the door is opening for experimental study of interactions among diverse organisms that can provide quantitative results for phenotypic variation in ecological and symbiotic functions (Busby et al., 2016a). Together with demographic and population genetic studies (Oono et al., 2014), such studies will illuminate evolutionary processes generating and maintaining variation for interactions among symbionts and between symbionts and their hosts.

This study aimed to elucidate how seed traits influence infestation dynamics and species interactions, focusing on acorn weevils infesting Quercus mongolica. Species identification and clarification of their evolutionary relationships within the Curculio genus were performed through phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene sequences. The seed infestation patterns were assessed by comparing the infestation rates across various seed size classes. Furthermore, the correlations between the seed morphological traits (length, width, aspect ratio, and weight) and weevil abundance were analyzed. The phylogenetic results revealed well-supported monophyletic clades corresponding to Curculio arakawai and Curculio sikkimensis. This confirmed the clear genetic separation between these two distinct weevil species, thereby substantiating the divergence observed in weevil populations correlated with different seed hosts. The infestation patterns revealed the association of weevil species-specific preferences with seed size: C. arakawai predominantly infested larger acorn seeds, whereas C. sikkimensis predominantly infested smaller acorn seeds. C. sikkimensis favored smaller ones. Both species exhibited positive correlations between abundance and seed length and width in larger seeds; however, the seed weight displayed no significant effect. These results indicate niche differentiation mediated by seed size and morphology, which likely reduced interspecific competition and facilitated coexistence. This study elucidates species-specific host selection patterns in acorn weevils and highlights acorn traits as crucial factors shaping seed predator assemblages. The findings provide valuable insights for developing targeted pest management strategies and supporting sustainable oak forest regeneration.",W4411351047,True,0.9918982982635498
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12398,Co‐evolution of foraging behaviour in herbivores and their natural enemies predicts multifunctionality of herbivore‐induced plant volatiles,"Summary Herbivorous arthropods often induce phenotypic changes in plants of terrestrial systems, which include increased direct resistance to herbivores. In addition, infested plants release quantitatively and qualitatively different volatiles from those of uninfested plants, which are so‐called herbivore‐induced plant volatiles ( HIPV s). Due to HIPV s, plants are more conspicuous to herbivorous arthropods and their natural enemies (carnivorous arthropods) than uninfested plants, thus acting as foraging cues in tri‐trophic systems. Intriguingly, herbivore and natural enemy responses to HIPV s are highly diverse. Whether they are attracted or repelled by HIPV s depend on the plant–herbivore–natural enemy species combination, suggesting a HIPV multifunctionality. We hypothesized that co‐evolutionary diversification of foraging strategies in herbivores and natural enemies, where arthropods adapted to diverse plant ecological traits, served to explain HIPV multifunctionality. We developed a food chain model of plant–herbivore–natural enemy to test our hypothesis, where plants exhibited three different states and different apparency (uninfested &lt; lightly infested &lt; highly infested) and quality (lightly infested &gt; highly infested). The shifts between plant states were mediated by herbivore life cycle, interactions among herbivores, natural enemies and plant reproduction. The natural enemy evolutionary stable strategy ( ESS ) was predicted to choose the lightly and heavily infested plants in broad ranges of induced direct resistance and plant apparency ( HIPV levels), implying that HIPV s acted as the induced indirect resistance. The corresponding herbivore ESS was to choose (or avoid) HIPV s when HIPV levels were low (or high). When the induced direct resistance was very high and thus herbivore quality was low, natural enemies tended to avoid increased HIPV s with increasing herbivory levels. This was associated with herbivore ESS choice for HIPV s, leading to intraspecific enemy‐free space. These predicted ESS diversities explained observed herbivore and natural enemy responses to HIPV s in several contrasting plant systems, including willow trees, lima bean and wild tobacco. Our findings suggest that non‐lethal herbivory and variations in induced plant responses are key mechanisms for evolutionary diversification of animal foraging behaviour and thus structure of ecological networks.",W1997053148,True,0.9861565828323364
https://doi.org/10.1002/bes2.1766,Ghosts of Competition and Predation Past: Why Ecologists Value Negative Over Positive Interactions,"In this lake, where competitions are fierce and continuous beyond any parallel in the worst periods of human history; […]; where robbery and murder and the deadly tyranny of strength over weakness are the unvarying rule; where what we call wrong-doing is always triumphant, and what we call goodness would be immediately fatal to its possessor, – even here, out of these hard conditions, an order has been evolved which is the best conceivable without a total change in the conditions themselves; an equilibrium has been reached and is steadily maintained that actually accomplishes for all the parties involved the greatest good which the circumstances will at all permit. In a system where life is the universal good, but the destruction of life the well nigh universal occupation, an order has spontaneously risen which constantly tends to maintain life at the highest limit, – a limit far higher, in fact, with respect to both quality and quantity, than would be possible in the absence of this destructive conflict. (Forbes 1887:87.) Phenomena in ecology are diverse. One would expect diverse phenomena to be investigated from diverse theoretical perspectives, but there are only a few dominant perspectives in modern ecology. Both negative and positive interactions occur in nature, and the importance and impact of both vary in time and space. It is not true, for instance, that competition and predation are the major forces affecting the fates of all communities and populations (cf. Hairston 1989). Nevertheless, ecologists have shown more interest in negative than in positive interactions. Let us consider how diverse phenomena have been explained in terms of competition or predation. Examples include the diversity and structure of communities (Paine 1966, Diamond 1975, Menge and Sutherland 1976), latitudinal gradients in body size (McNab 1971), the evolution of body size (Dawkins and Krebs 1979), the latitudinal diversity gradient (Dobzhansky 1950, Menge and Sutherland 1976), the diversity–stability rule (Lehman and Tilman 2000), trait evolution (Brown and Wilson 1956), and many phenomena about insular or isolated populations and communities (Grant 1966, Lomolino 1985). There is no list of phenomena explained in terms of positive interactions that is close in diversity to those ecologists have explained in terms of negative interactions. Positive interactions refer to cooperation (+/+), symbiosis (+/+) or (+/0), mutualism (+/+), and commensalism (+/0), in which at least one participant (an organism, population, or species) receives positive effects from the interaction without negatively affecting the other participant. In the case of negative or antagonistic interactions such as competition (−/−) or predation (+/−), at least one participant negatively affects the other. I conducted a preliminary analysis by searching for the hits of six common interaction terms from articles published in journals (n = 11). The terms in question were the same as those given below. I used the publisher's web pages, if available, or JSTOR (searching titles, abstract, and keywords for all available years). Table 1 and the graphic depiction in Fig. 1 report the data: Across different journals, competition and predation dominate in terms of numbers of published articles making reference to them vis-à-vis positive interactions. Aggregate data on numbers of hits for search terms in journals, as shown in Table 1, are not informative about dominance and its reasons. It reveals nothing about the relative frequencies of the search terms as research topics. It is also silent on the issue of whether the dominance has changed over time. Data were collected from five journals via JSTOR. I searched for hits for the following six interaction terms from articles published in journals: ""competition,"" ""predation,"" ""cooperation,"" ""symbiosis,"" ""mutualism,"" and ""commensalism."" The dataset contains more than 50,000 published articles searched for the above six search terms, covering a period of publication history ranging from 60 to 100 years. I chose a 10-year period as the interval for the collection and comparison of data. The search covered the abstracts, titles, and key words of all the articles published in the journal in question. These data were collected and recorded as hits for each search term, and in other words, the number of articles published in the journal within a certain period that made explicit reference to a search term. The resulting data are recorded in Tables 2–6 for each journal. Given that the number of articles published in journals varies over time, the number of hits for a search term in a specific journal during a certain period (data in Tables 2–6) does not in itself give the right sort of information about its relative prevalence, currently or previously, in that journal. The numbers of articles making reference to search terms were converted into estimations of relative frequencies (i.e., the number articles that count as hits for the search term/the number of all published articles in the journal). These relative frequencies, expressed as percentages, are recorded in Tables 2–6. The reason for making this conversion was to obtain dimensionless numbers that could be compared, which facilitated comparison of the relative importance or centrality of search terms qua research topics in different journals and different periods. The requirements for a journal to be counted as a data source included having a relative long history of data available online (at least from the year 1950), most of the articles being in English, and allowing estimation of the number of all published articles within a certain period for the whole period under investigation. Quite a few journals fulfilled these requirements, including those listed in Table 1, such as Plant Ecology. Two journals that are general in scope and three that are more specific were chosen as data sources. The choice of Oikos and Ecology as the general-focus journals related partly to the fact that the former is published by an American and the latter by a European ecological society: Any differences between European and American ecology should become visible when the data are compared. As a note, Ecology, established in 1920, was originally entitled Plant World. The focus in the new journal, at least during the first decade, was on the ecology of plants. Two plant journals, the Journal of Ecology and the American Journal of Botany, and one animal journal, the Journal of Animal Ecology, were chosen as additional sources. The data obtained could be compared both among these three journals and to data from the general-focus journals. Moreover, plant and animal journals typically have long publication histories. I give another reason for choosing journals specializing in plant and animal ecology in the Discussion. Not all the interaction terms were included in the search, as I decided to concentrate on the most common. Amensalism (−/0) and parasitism (+/−) were left out, for instance. Of the search terms used, ""cooperation"" is probably the most unreliable. Not only it is an umbrella term that could cover several specific positive interactions, it is likely that not all the hits reported in the tables refer to cooperation as a biological phenomenon (see Table 6 and the next section). Thus, the numbers of hits could be inflated. The opposite is true of ""predation."" The term does not capture all instances of the phenomenon, and thus, the number of hits could be deflated (see Table 2 and the next section). ""Symbiosis"" is another umbrella term, which I included among positive interactions. There is a close connection between symbiosis and mutualism/commensalism, albeit certain authors include parasitism and even predation under symbiotic interactions (Sapp 2004, Martin and Schwab 2013). No consensus exists as to its definition, save that symbiotic interactions take place in proximity and/or are persistent. To calculate the relative frequencies of the search terms, it was necessary to estimate the total number of articles published in journals during each period included in the search. There is no generally accepted method for estimating these numbers, apart from counting all the journal articles. This would be too onerous and as prone to errors as alternative methods. Nor was it possible to obtain these data online for all the periods under investigation, and therefore, I used other methods. In certain cases, I chose a year that represented the average annual number of issues/page numbers over a decade, counted the number of articles published that year, and multiplied that number by 10. In certain other cases, it was necessary to count the number of articles from a certain year as representative of two or three years (and to multiply accordingly), then to count the number of articles published in another year as representative of other years during that period (and to multiply that number accordingly), and finally to add the numbers. In the 20th century, there was substantial variance in the journals in terms of issue, page, and article numbers. In certain journals, the number of published articles per issue increased a great deal during the time period, whereas the increase was more moderate in others. In fact, in some cases there was a decrease, despite an increase in page numbers in the issues (the articles are longer). Thus, the total numbers of articles published in a journal during a 10-year period are estimations and are reported in the last column of Tables 2–6. I may have over- or underestimated them. Note that an over- or underestimation would similarly bias all the calculated values based on these estimations within that period, that is, percentages in Tables 2–6. Over- or underestimation of the total number of articles would affect the calculated percentages unevenly, however: The higher the calculated percentage based on an over- or underestimation, the further the calculated value is from the real value. The variance in the percentages, over- or underestimated by 10%, is between circa ±5% and ±3% for the highest calculated percentages reported below, and between circa ±2% and ±0% percent for the calculated percentages under 20 reported below. I investigated several journals to guard against over- and underestimation errors. Given that the data points to consistent trends among the terms searched in different journals and across different periods, I doubt there are serious errors as far as estimation bias is concerned. Many of the results I discuss are robust, based on data from different journals. Nevertheless, the percentage calculations are based on estimations. Accordingly, the percentages in Tables 2–6 should be considered indicative of general trends rather than exact and accurate values. The numbers of hits for the search terms and their percentages (Tables 2–6) within a given period in a journal are not additive: One article could count as a hit for any number of search terms. It was beyond the scope of the present study to investigate any tendency for certain search terms to occur together, even though the data indicate that many articles make reference to both competition and predation. The data collected show how competition and predation have dominated ecology. The numbers and percentages of published articles referring to negative interactions rose up until the 1980s or 1990s. During these two decades, between 50% and 60% of all articles published in journals made reference to competition and/or predation, whereas the corresponding numbers for positive interactions were clearly much lower (generally <10%). Even though the respective percentages have recently gone down, competition and predation still dominate vis-à-vis positive interaction in terms of numbers and percentages (Tables 2–6, Figs. 2-6). The results reported should not be interpreted as indicating that the high percentages for competition and predation are indicative of the truth or evidential support. It is quite likely that many of the articles that count as hits are critical, questioning or finding no data to support these theories. What the results do indicate, however, is where the main research interests and foci in ecology have been, and what are marginal phenomena. The main finding is that there has been bias in ecology favoring negative over positive interactions in published articles, and there still is. Just a cursory glance at the tables reveals that even if a search term had the highest number of hits during one of the investigated periods in a particular journal, it does not mean that the relative frequency was the highest during that period. For example, although ""competition"" typically had the highest number of hits in the last period of investigation for each journal, the relative frequency tended to decrease. Let us compare Table 3. The highest number of hits for competition in Oikos (1,592) occurs between 2000 and 2009. Because the total number of published articles in the journal rose from 1,840 (in 1990–1999) to 2,600 (in 2000–2009), the number of articles referring to competition (i.e., hits) also rose. However, the number of articles referring to competition fell in percentage terms from 67 (in 1990–1999) to 61 (in 2000–2009). It is the relative frequency of search terms (percentages) rather than the numbers of hits that is the most relevant. Data on numbers of hits alone might give misleading information about the relative frequency or importance of search terms qua research topics. The top three percentages for competition are 67 (in Oikos and the Journal of Ecology, Tables 3, 5), 61 (in Ecology, Table 2), and 53 (in the Journal of Animal Ecology, Table 4); and for predation are 55 (in Oikos, Table 3), 52 (in the Journal of Animal Ecology, Table 4), and 39 (in Ecology, Table 2). The respective percentages for positive interactions are nowhere near these levels. Negative interactions dominate (see Figs. 2-6, which visualize the data from Tables 2–6). This is especially clear in the Journal of Animal Ecology, with high percentages for both predation and competition and low percentages for positive interactions (Table 4, Fig. 4). The trends are similar in Ecology (Table 2, Fig. 2), Oikos (Table 3, Fig. 3), and the Journal of Ecology, with high percentages for competition in certain periods and relatively moderate percentages for predation (Table 5, Fig. 5), and high percentages for competition during certain periods in the American Journal of Botany (Table 6, Fig. 6). Either competition or predation dominate almost consistently throughout the investigated periods in both the numbers of published articles and percentages (Tables 2–6, Figs. 2-6). The time-series data show an interesting pattern of dominance. The percentages (but not always the numbers) of articles making reference to competition and predation tended to drop (Figs. 7, 8). This trend began in the 1980s or 1990s in all the journals except the Journal of Ecology, which may have been a ""late bloomer."" There was an almost monotonic increase in percentage hits for competition and predation in practically all the journals investigated, beginning from the 1950s or 1960s and ending in the 1980s or 1990s. Since then, the percentages have come down (e.g., in Ecology the highest percentage for competition was 61 in the 1980s, and 46 in the latest period covered; the respective numbers for predation are 39 and 26 (Table 2). The difference is less steep but clear enough in other journals: cf. 67% and 61%, respectively, in Oikos for competition, and 55% and 49% for predation (Table 3). It is thus possible that the same pattern is unfolding in the Journal of Ecology: Given that no data were available for the years 2010–2019, it was not possible to verify whether the percentage hits for competition and predation kept on rising, leveled off, or reduced. Nevertheless, the latest percentage for competition (67) in the Journal of Ecology is very high, although the highest percentage for predation (21) remains moderate (Table 5). The highest percentages for positive interactions lag far behind those for negative interactions, the highest being for cooperation (e.g., 21% and 16% in Ecology, see Table 2). The numbers and percentages could be overinflated in this case and in general. For instance, ""cooperation"" yielded 84 (1920–1929) and 102 (1930–1939) hits in the American Journal of Botany (Table 6). These numbers appeared to be too high. Having checked the hits, I found out that 70–80% had nothing to do with cooperation as a biological phenomenon. Consequently, these were removed and the corrected numbers were 25 (1920–1929) and 37 (1930–1939). In this case, the uncorrected percentages for cooperation would have been 19 (1920–1929) and 14 (1930–1939). The corrected percentages are 5% in both cases. The second highest percentages for positive interactions are for mutualism: 13 in Ecology (Table 2), 9 in Oikos (Table 3), and 8 in the Journal of Ecology (Table 5). With regard to symbiosis the highest percentages are 5 in the Journal of Ecology (Table 5), 4 in Ecology (Table 2) and the American Journal of Botany (Table 6), and 3 in Oikos (Table 3). Commensalism has been a marginally investigated phenomenon, with a highest hit rate of 2% (Ecology, Table 2). In general, it is mentioned in less than 1% of all articles published in the journals. The low numbers are curious, given that commensalism could be considered the rule rather than the exception in nature. Many ecologists believed that negative interactions are important and deserve more attention than other interactions, since they give structure to communities (see Introduction for references). The idea was debated and contested, for instance, in the context of null models/hypotheses (see Epistemic values). Moreover, evidence for the idea is equivocal (Connell 1983, Hairston 1989). Even if the idea of negative interactions giving structure to communities was generally true, commensalistic interactions play major roles in sustaining and maintaining communities (e.g., detritivory and the oxygen production by green plants). There are thus no reasons to treat commensalistic interactions less prevalent nor less important in functions or effects than other interactions. The time-series trend for positive interactions differs from that for negative interactions. Both the numbers of articles making reference to and the percentages for positive interactions are currently rising in the journals investigated, more clearly in some than in others. Cooperation shows the least clear trend in this regard, but at least in three journals there is a small rising percentage trajectory (see Fig. 9; the numbers in Ecology vary too much). With regard to symbiosis (Fig. 10) and mutualism (Fig. 11), there is a clear recent trend toward higher percentages in all the journals investigated, with the exception of the Journal of Animal Ecology with regard to symbiosis. Another exception is commensalism (no trend, see Fig. 12), which I will exclude from discussion from this point. The trend toward higher percentage hits for positive interactions (and higher numbers of articles making reference to them) seems to have begun in the 1970s or 1980s. Even in a journal that appears to be most obviously favoring negative interactions, namely the Journal of Animal Ecology, in which there is the least steep recent percentage reduction for competition and predation as well (from 53 to 50 for competition and from 52 to 45 for predation), the positive interactions are on the rise in terms of both numbers and percentages of published articles (Table 4, Fig. 4). The only partial exception is the Journal of Ecology, in which there has been a recent percentage rise for both negative and positive interactions (Fig. 5). The study period covers 60–100 years of publication history in the journals concerned. There is almost no period in which competition, at least, was not dominant. In some journals, both competition and predation are dominant (Figs. 2-4), whereas in others it is just competition (Figs. 5, 6). There are two exceptions. The first, the dominance of cooperation, could be an apparent exception, attributable to the methods used. The second, a lesser dominance of competition and/or predation in the plant journals, is probably real and indicative of the reasons for the dominance of negative interactions. In Ecology, from 1920 to 1959 (Table 2, Fig. 2), the percentages for cooperation are higher than those for predation. Similarly in the American Journal of Botany, cooperation dominates competition early on (1920–1949), and predation up until the 1980s (Table 6, Fig. 6). This exception could be a spurious result of the methodology used: The hits for ""cooperation"" could be overinflated (as explained above) and the hits for ""predation"" might be underrepresented in both cases. As for the latter, there are no hits for ""predation"" for the years 1920–1929 in Ecology, for instance, despite the fact that the phenomenon was a featured topic in the articles published during the period (Table 2). It may be that the term became popular later on. To remain consistent in my searches and results, I will continue to use ""predation"" with reference to all the journals and periods, even if it results in a somewhat underestimated representation of the phenomenon in the published articles. It is worth noting that even if the reported numbers and percentages for ""predation"" are underestimated and the reported numbers and percentages for ""cooperation"" are overestimated, the main result is reinforced: Competition and predation dominate in ecology more than my data indicate. The second exception, as mentioned, concerns the low percentages for both competition and predation in the American Journal of Botany up until the 1970s or 1980s (Table 6, Fig. 6). Negative interactions were not clearly dominant in the journal before this period: In fact, they are clearly less dominant in this journal than in any other (Fig. 13). Moreover, there is no clear dominance of predation in this journal. I doubt that this is an artifact; the period is too long, and the pattern is too consistent. Moreover, the percentages for positive interactions are not exceptionally low. The pattern is similar in another plant journal, the Journal of Ecology, although it is not as clear (Table 5, Fig. 5). Competition seems to dominate, although the percentages are relatively low up until the two or three latest decades. Moreover, the percentages for predation also remain consistently low. There is a contrast here between the plant journals and the animal journal, the Journal of Animal Ecology, in which the percentages for competition and predation are consistently high and those for positive interactions are low (Fig. 4). Thus, there seems to be some pattern in the dominance of negative interactions: It is more pronounced in certain journals than in others. It is generally assumed that the reason for the dominance of theories should lie in their epistemic (or cognitive) values (cf. Douglas 2011). Epistemically, valuable theories are supported by and fit to diverse data, unify phenomena, provide good explanations and accurate predictions, are simple and fruitful, and so on. These advantages, which many ecologists also think of as epistemic virtues or values (see Marquet et al. 2014), could constitute valid scientific reasons for the dominance of competition and predation theories. Simplicity is a notoriously difficult concept to define. Moreover, simplicity of a theory could be a virtue for different reasons. I doubt there is much in competition or predation theories to be defended in terms of simplicity. Change the sign of one or two of the parameters in a competition or predation model and the result is a model for mutualism or commensalism. This model is, according to most definitions of simplicity, as simple as the original one. In fact, models of negative interactions have become more complex over time. As one learns about the conditions under which competition models, for instance, do not hold in nature (luxury competition, environmental heterogeneity, intermediate disturbances, and so on), more and more conditions and assumptions are added to cover these instances. Even if it were the case that competition and predation theories were simpler than alternative theories, simplicity is not necessarily a truth-conductive virtue of a theory. Nature may be complex. In general, ecology has a moderate historical record in making accurate predictions (cf. Hall 1988, Peters 1991, Doak et al. 2008, Houlahan et al. 2017). The above holds for competition and predation theories as well. Hutchinson's (1961) ""The Paradox of the Plankton"" is illustrative. The paradox is, as the plankton case showed, that exactly the opposite of what competition theory predicted should be true was true: a high diversity of species with similar niches coexisting in a habitat in which resources are very limiting and limited. Yet, competition theory was not discarded. On the contrary: Hutchison tried to save it on the grounds of environmental heterogeneity. Had ecologists treated the plankton case as a crucial experiment, the data should have falsified the theory. Undoubtedly, the main reason for its non-rejection was that it was already treated as dominant. It is unquestionable that there are more empirical data on competition and predation than on positive interactions. The amount of data alone provides no justification for the dominance, however. In the first place, this could be the consequence of dominance rather than the cause. Second, it is not true that data unequivocally support these theories, as more and more apparently disconfirming evidence has accumulated. Thus, it is debatable whether these theories are better supported by data than alternative theories. It is possible, for instance, that the majority of articles reported as hits for competition and predation in my dataset turn out to concern cases that were devoid of supporting data, or even had data disconfirming these theories. Nor it is true that competition and predation theory fit data about phenomena better than alternative theories. As the null model/hypothesis debate has shown, phenomena that competition theory have been used to account for could equally well be explained by alternative theories that have nothing do with competition (cf. Connor and Simberloff 1979, Strong et al. 1979, Hastings 1987). In other words, alternative theories fit the same data equally well. Competition and predation theories appear to be fruitful, having been applied to diverse phenomena. They therefore unify many phenomena within a few theoretical perspectives. However, potential fruitfulness and unificatory power are not proper epistemic values. Non- and pseudo-scientific theories may be extremely fruitful and potentially unifying. Moreover, the real fruitfulness and unificatory power of competition and predation theories is questionable. In the case of phenomena given as examples in the Introduction, it was discovered later on that many of the explanations derived from such theories were not correct and other theories were needed to arrive at better or more plausible explanations. Finally, it is possible that the apparent fruitfulness of competition and predation theories in explaining and unifying diverse phenomena is the consequence of theoretical dominance in the first place, rather than the cause. The above should not be understood as criticism of competition or predation theories. If there is criticism of them in this article, it is the following comparative claim: These theories dominate despite there being obvious epistemic reasons for the dominance vis-à-vis alternative theories. Moreover, if this is true, some other, non-scientific factors might explain the dominance. I will now introduce a neglected aspect and explanation: Dominance can be attributed to accidental historical facts. My alternative hypothesis is that competition and predation theories have dominated in ecology at least partly because of the predominance of male researchers in the past. To support this hypothesis one would need data about the history of ecology and especially on the roles and fates of female ecologists in the last century. In what follows, I rely on data collected by Langenheim (1988, 1996), which mainly concerns American women ecologists in the 20th century. I was unable to find comparable data from Europe. For this reason, I focus on general trends and assume that they are generalizable (cf. Figs. 2, 3: no major differences in the research topics in terms of data or emphasis between American and European journals for the years the two can be compared). Among those obtaining a PhD in ecology or a related discipline during 1900–1920, a large percentage were women, particularly in certain universities/departments in the United States. The numbers and percentages declined during 1930–1950. Following the women's liberation and environmental movements of the 1960s and, especially, the 1970s, the numbers of women with a PhD and other degrees began to rise considerably. Yet, it was not until the 1990s that there was rough gender equality among members of the Ecological Society of America aged under 25 years. Most of the women who were awarded a PhD before the 1960s were not given research positions. With a few notable exceptions, women with a PhD or any other degree became teachers or research assistants, notably to their husbands. Thus, throughout over half of the existence of modern ecology, most of those who published articles and worked as researchers were men. To get some data, I checked the authors' gender in articles published in Ecology: Not a single author could be identified as a woman in 1920 (four authors remained unidentified as to gender), and in 1950, there were four women authors (f",W3081141055,True,0.9316598773002625
https://doi.org/10.2307/177290,Condition-Specific Competition: Implications for the Altitudinal Distribution of Stream Fishes,"The occupation of adjacent, nonoverlapping positions along environmental gradients by closely related and ecologically similar species has drawn considerable attention from many ecologists over the past decades. Condition-specific competition, wherein competitive superiority varies with the abiotic environmental gradient, has been proposed as the major structuring force behind such distributions. However, few studies have elucidated the underlying mechanisms, such as behavioral and demographic processes. We conducted laboratory experiments to examine the effects of temperature on interspecific competition between two stream salmonid fishes, Salvelinus malma and S. leucomaenis. The two species have a largely allopatric altitudinal distribution on Hokkaido Island, Japan, proposed to be the result of temperature-mediated competition. We tested predictions that at a higher temperature (12°C), S. leucomaenis would dominate over S. malma in aggressive interactions, foraging performance, growth, and survival, but become subordinate at a lower temperature (6°C). Indeed, S. leucomaenis initiated a greater number of aggressive acts, attained greater food intake and greater growth, and finally excluded S. malma at the higher temperature. Although the two species initiated a similar number of aggressive acts and foraged equally well at the lower temperature, S. leucomaenis achieved a higher growth rate than S. malma; however, the latter eventually became numerically dominant. Clear competitive release in allopatry occurred for S. malma only at the higher temperature, providing direct evidence of condition-specific asymmetric competition. The lower distribution boundary of S. malma in Hokkaido streams may therefore be determined by temperature-mediated condition-specific competition. However, mechanisms determining the upper distribution boundary of S. leucomaenis could not be fully explained by the competitive results at lower temperature, but required an understanding of how effects of competition interacted with species-specific physiological traits. Thus, species distributions along an environmental gradient cannot be solely explained by a simple model of condition-specific competition without considering mechanistic linkages among behavioral and physiological responses to the environment, resource use, and demographic processes.",W4232243099,True,0.9969538450241089
https://doi.org/10.1111/een.12667,Pay it forward: refuse dump from leaf‐cutting ants promotes caterpillar digestive performance by increasing plant nitrogen content,"1. The activity of soil‐disturbing animals that increase soil nutrients can affect the carbon : nitrogen (C : N) ratio of plants, which, in turn, may determine the transfer of energy and nutrients through higher trophic levels. However, the strength and sign of this indirect effect depend on whether enhanced nutrient substrates increase plant foliar nutrients and/or plant defensive traits. 2. We investigated how the nutrient‐rich refuse dumps of the leaf‐cutting ant Acromyrmex lobicornis, as a result of their direct effects on thistles, indirectly impact the growth rate and digestive performance of a generalist chewing herbivore. We also included the application of commercial fertilisers to test whether the enhanced soil nutrients comprises the mechanism behind the impact of refuse dumps on the upward cascade effects. 3. Thistles growing on nutrient‐rich substrates (i.e. ant refuse dumps and fertilised soil) had more and larger leaves, up to 80% lower C : N ratios, and higher physical defences compared to plants growing on steppe soil. Caterpillars showed an enhanced digestive performance and growth rate when feed on nutrient‐rich plants and were able to adjust the C : N ratio of their excretion to regulate the relative acquisition of nutrients. 4. The positive effect of nutrient‐rich substrates on caterpillar feeding efficiency suggest that the enhanced nutritional quality of the thistles could compensate for the negative effects of the increased physical defences. The results of the present study indicate how organisms that increase soil nutrient availability may diminish the stoichiometric constraints at the base of food chains, enhancing the development and growth rate of herbivores and, thus, indirectly mediating plant–herbivore interactions.",W2885504066,True,0.9923537969589233
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2904,Disturbance size and frequency mediate the coexistence of benthic spatial competitors,"Disturbance plays a key role in structuring community dynamics and is central to conservation and natural resource management. However, ecologists continue to debate the importance of disturbance for species coexistence and biodiversity. Such disagreements may arise in part because few studies have examined variation across multiple dimensions of disturbance (e.g., size, frequency) and how the effects of disturbance may depend on species attributes (e.g., competitiveness, dispersal ability). In light of this gap in understanding and accelerating changes to disturbance regimes worldwide, we used spatial population models to explore how disturbance size and frequency interact with species attributes to affect coexistence between seagrass (Zostera marina) and colonial burrowing shrimp (Neotrypaea californiensis) that compete for benthic space in estuaries throughout the west coast of North America. By simulating population dynamics under a range of ecologically relevant disturbance regimes, we discovered that intermediate disturbance (approximately 9-23% of landscape area per year) to short-dispersing, competitively dominant seagrass can foster long-term stable coexistence with broad-dispersing, competitively inferior burrowing shrimp via the spatial storage effect. When holding the total extent of disturbance constant, the individual size and annual frequency of disturbance altered landscape spatial patterns and mediated the dominance and evenness of competitors. Many small disturbances favored short-dispersing seagrass by hastening recolonization, whereas fewer large disturbances benefited rapidly colonizing burrowing shrimp by creating temporary refugia from competition. As a result, large, infrequent disturbances generally improved the strength and stability of coexistence relative to small, frequent disturbances. Regardless of disturbance size or frequency, the dispersal ability of the superior competitor (seagrass), the competitive ability of the inferior competitor (burrowing shrimp), and the reproduction and survival of both species strongly influenced population abundances and coexistence. Our results show that disturbance size and frequency can promote or constrain coexistence by altering the duration of time over which inferior competitors can escape competitive exclusion, particularly when colonization depends on the spatial pattern of disturbance due to dispersal traits. For coastal managers and conservation practitioners, our findings indicate that reducing particularly large disturbances may help conserve globally imperiled seagrass meadows and control burrowing shrimp colonies that can threaten the viability of oyster aquaculture.",W2975996018,True,0.9875180721282959
https://doi.org/10.1002/bes2.2145,When the window is a mirror: how do dominant theories limit our understanding of nature? (<scp>ESA</scp> 2023 <scp>INS23</scp>),"In our zealous desire for familiar models of explanation, we risk not noticing the discrepancies between our own predispositions and the range of possibilities inherent in natural phenomena. In short, we risk imposing on nature the very stories we like to hear. Evelyn Fox Keller, 1985 Reflections on Gender and Science The narratives and metaphors that ecologists use to describe natural phenomena influence what we study and how we do it (Larson 2011, Craver and Darden 2013, Otto and Rosales 2020). Stories about ecological processes and patterns are told through particular frames and are laden with assumptions arising from their framing. For example, the tubercle bacillus became the cause of tuberculosis, rather than unregulated industrial capitalism, through storytelling: the framing of the story was biomedical, and as a result the assumption for how to treat tuberculosis was through individual medical intervention, rather than (for example) a social revolution (Levins and Lewontin 1985). More recently, a commonly cited solution to rising CO2 emissions is to plant trees, which conveniently elides the social and economic roots of global warming. The responsible use of particular frames, narratives, and analogies for understanding nature requires that we reflect on our choices: Which stories do we tell? How do we tell them? And how do they structure the way we study the natural world? To make room for this kind of reflection, we organized and participated in an Inspire session entitled ""When the window is a mirror: how do dominant theories limit our understanding of nature?"" at the ESA 2023 meeting. This session was an attempt to explore the limitations of current theory and their consequences for understanding what we observe in the natural world. In a set of case studies, we examined existing ""mirrors"": examples in which ecological models are built on assumptions that constrain the research process, and in doing so reveal something about ourselves and the narratives we privilege. Our speakers described the limits of theory on topics ranging from sexual behavior to plant–microbe interactions to genetic polymorphism. This allowed us to look for uniting themes across subdisciplines of ecology. In bringing these subdisciplines together, we attempted to highlight such limitations not as isolated exceptions, but rather as recurring consequences of singular, dominant ways of approaching ecological questions. Our session emphasized the importance of creativity and wonderment in scientific research and the power of pluralistic approaches for confronting theoretical limitations brought on by societal assumptions. Same-sex sexual behavior (SSB) is widespread throughout the animal kingdom. For years, Western scientists ignored, downplayed, or discounted this behavior as a costly aberration. More recent work, including our own, has recognized that SSB is not only common but may have a long evolutionary history and need not incur fitness costs (Monk et al. 2019, Lerch and Servedio 2021, Richardson and Zuk 2023). As recognition of the scope of SSB among animals has grown in both scientific understanding and popular culture, many have questioned what these insights mean for our understanding of human sexuality; does the fact that animals engage in SSB make it ""natural""? Demonstrating the diversity of sexual systems and sexual behaviors found in nature is undoubtedly vital for increasing feelings of belonging among queer students and researchers in the sciences (Casper et al. 2022). However, our reframing of the study of SSB in animals shows us how what we understand to be ""natural"" in the first place is inevitably shaped by the cultures, norms, and values that scientists ourselves hold. We argue that there is great danger in positioning what is deemed ""objectively natural"" as the arbiter of what is culturally normative, moral, or appropriate. Instead, as scientists we should aim to interrogate and articulate our values and politics, and think critically about how they inform our decisions; what questions we ask, hypotheses we make, methods we use, results and voices we uplift, and interpretations we favor. It is important to study and share the extraordinary sexual diversity found among nonhuman species, and indeed to combat narratives that aim to simplify the public's understanding of biological sex and sexual behavior. However, we should be clear that queer and trans identities are valid no matter the science on animal behavior and sexual evolution, and that acceptance of human diversity should not be predicated on our constantly shifting understanding of the ""natural"" world. The temporal order and interval of community assembly can often affect how species interact. Generally defined as ""priority effect,"" this phenomenon interested both empiricists and theoreticians (Fukami 2015). However, our theories are often limited in their ability to characterize priority effects in nature because they do not incorporate two principles about time. First, ecological communities operate on a range of time scales. Priority effects influence communities of organisms ranging from bacteria and yeast to plant and amphibian communities. The vast differences in life history among these communities may imply distinctive underlying biological mechanisms for priority effects in each community. Second, all ecological processes take time; therefore, changes in species interactions should depend on the length of the difference in arrival times, which can determine their relative sizes or the degree of habitat modification (Rudolf 2019). These features are not well incorporated into theoretical explanations of priority effects, which are often based on positive frequency dependence: if both species limit the other more than themselves, the more abundant species wins (Ke and Letten 2018). This conception is detached from the two principles about time because the early species is not necessarily more abundant in communities with slow-reproducing species, and this theory does not allow for temporal changes in species interactions. To bridge theory and experiments of priority effects, we define those arising from positive frequency dependence as ""frequency-dependent"" priority effects, and those arising from temporal changes in species interactions as ""trait-dependent"" priority effects, because they are usually caused by changes in traits over arrival times, such as size, age, or behavior (Zou and Rudolf 2023). This categorization accommodates diverse biological mechanisms in nature, including interactions beyond competition that change with time. Models of priority effects should be designed with the two principles about time in mind to capture different ecosystems more accurately. Plant communities are shaped by their bidirectional interactions with beneficial and detrimental soil microbes (van der Putten et al. 2013). To predict the long-term consequences of plant–soil microbe interactions, ecologists often employ a two-phased experiment inspired by the theory of plant–soil feedback (Bever et al. 1997). The classic experimental design consists of a conditioning phase, during which plants modify the soil community, and a subsequent response phase, during which plants respond to the modification. However, like theoretical models, experiments are also an abstraction of nature. Specifically, by immediately transplanting the responding seedling after soil conditioning, experiments implicitly assume that new plants immediately arrive or that the conditioned microbial legacies are long-lasting after the death of the host plant. Nevertheless, recent research has shown that this assumption may not hold in various systems, such as those characterized by distinct seasonality or frequent disturbance (Nagendra and Peterson 2016, Esch and Kobe 2021). Neglecting the temporal decay of microbial legacies in these systems can lead to incorrect predictions of plant competitive outcomes or an overestimation of microbial impact (Ke et al. 2021). Therefore, while the common two-phased design aims for generality, it is crucial to consider the natural history of different systems when extrapolating experimental results to a natural context (Travis 2020). Plants have the capacity to change the climate around them (Lembrechts 2023, Novick and Barnes 2023). In particular, plants open their stomata to photosynthesize and consequently move water out of the soil and into the air around their leaves. This cools and humidifies microclimates and macroclimates. Grasses can do this at small scales (Wright et al. 2021), while tropical forest trees can drive climatic changes at the scale of entire regions (Wright et al. 2017). Initial attempts to quantify the effect of vegetation on climate have focused on understory temperatures (e.g. Lembrechts 2023), which are locally correlated with relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit. These attempts have shown that every type of vegetation on earth can either cool or warm the microclimate (warming is most common in cold biomes where vegetation can insulate and create areas of warmer air). These changes in microclimate conditions affect performance of plants (Aguirre et al. 2021), plant trait expression (Watson et al. 2023), plant–plant interaction strengths (Wright et al. 2014), and productivity (Aguirre et al. 2021). Because vegetation-induced temperature, humidity, and vapor pressure deficit changes are ubiquitous and inevitable, I think it is important to reimagine a world where all other types of interactions (including competition) are nested within these constructed microclimates. Plants compete for resources, and in a purely competitive world diversity is maintained by intraspecific competition: a plant species must compete with itself more strongly than with other species to ensure coexistence. Intraspecific competition has become so central to our understanding of plant diversity that it is standard procedure to set all plant interactions as competitive when simulating plant communities or parameterizing population and species distribution models. While we know that plants are also capable of intraspecific facilitation, these beneficial interactions are rarely accounted for in frameworks of diversity maintenance, and certainly not in predictions of coexistence. In this talk, I present extensive evidence of intraspecific facilitation in a diverse, natural plant system when relaxing the above restrictions on models and parameterizations. We found that intraspecific facilitation varied idiosyncratically across species and environmental conditions, indicating it is not simply an isolated exception, but rather a pervasive force shaping community diversity. Current theoretical frameworks do not allow coexistence when intraspecific facilitation is operating, despite empirical evidence to the contrary. Competitive theories of diversity maintenance can therefore describe certain conditions under which coexistence should arise but clearly do not capture the full spectrum of conditions under which coexistence can arise. Current theory is thus neither exhaustive nor should it be limiting. Creating novel theory which better reflects what we observe in nature requires us to be inspired by the unexpected rather than blinded to it. Dominant theories of population ecology limit our understanding of the population ecology of mutualism. For nearly a half century we have seen marginalization of the theoretical study of mutualism through explicit dismissal (""… unlike trophic interactions, mutualisms do not seem to be of universal importance,"" Turchin (2013)) and self-admonishing ""laziness"" (May 1981). But this systemic underrepresentation of mutualism relative to other interspecific interactions like competition and predation is most clearly observed through quantitative analysis of books Simha et al. (2022) and primary literature (Bronstein 1994, Raerinne 2020). Recently, however, mutualism has been viewed and modeled as a consumer–resource interaction (e.g., Holland et al. 2005), which has been incredibly important and useful theoretically (e.g., De Mazancourt and Schwartz 2010, Holland and DeAngelis 2010) and empirically (e.g., Lim et al. 2018). Although framing mutualism as a consumer–resource interaction helps it fit within the dominant theoretical framework, and provides some mathematical conveniences (i.e., to ""put a curve on it"" in order to prevent unbounded growth, and because a Type I functional response can be recovered by a Type II response by setting a parameter to 0), I wanted to draw attention to the idea that not all mutualisms can or should be described by this framework. Conceptually there are some issues for the most common and ecologically important mutualisms like pollination, seed dispersal, and defense where half of the entire interaction is not a consumer–resource interaction. For example, Revilla (2015) asked, ""… what is the handling time of a plant that uses a pollinator or seed disperser? Or at which rate does a plant attack a service?"" I also presented unpublished data showing that the Holling type II numerical and functional responses do not seem to be common across empirical studies of mutualism: most seem to be unimodal. Mutualistic interactions are wonderfully diverse and essential parts of communities and ecosystems. Although many mutualisms fit within the dominant consumer–resource theory, I ask that we continue to better understand mutualisms by not assuming they are fully explained as a consumer–resource interaction and embracing and marveling in their diversity and complexity. The distributions of parent materials, topography, and latitude, as well as disturbance history and the presence of nearby islands, are important drivers of island biodiversity dynamics (Brandeis et al. 2009, Carstensen et al. 2012, Whittaker et al. 2017). These conditions have also been influential in the process of European colonization of Caribbean islands due to their influence on island suitability for colonial extraction (Parsons 1975, Watts 1990, Mahony and Endfield 2018). Suitability for plantation colonialism may include potential landscape productivity (e.g. latitude, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, and altitude), resources to support long-term intensive monocropping (e.g., groundwater availability), and sufficient resources to manage large enslaved populations (Ross 2017). The biogeographical determinants of European plantation colonization and consequences for island biogeography following sustained plantation disturbances remain largely unaddressed in terrestrial ecology. Through a field study on the former Danish colony of St. Croix (U.S. Virgin Islands), my colleagues and I aim to test whether the aforementioned state factors predict the intensity of colonial ecosystem disturbance (proxied by duration of colonization, cultivated area, primary crops, and cumulative enslaved populations from Danish archival records). Our work uses interdisciplinary methods to describe how the relationship between state factors and degree of colonization may be predictive of the reassembly of forest vegetation communities following the abandonment of sugarcane plantation fields. We hypothesize that post-plantation soil environments are physically disturbed and nutrient-limited due to long-term agricultural degradation. On post-plantation islands like St. Croix, the relative abundance taxa with functional traits that can alleviate resource limitations (e.g., leguminous, C4 photosynthetic, and arbuscular mycorrhizal taxa (Dovrat et al. 2020)) may vary along axes of former plantation intensity and state factors which are known to present the greatest utility for colonial exploitation (i.e., greatest contiguous area of alluvial soils, highest annual precipitation, dominant calcareous parent material, etc.). As we scale our field-based, island-specific work up to larger spatial scales, we ultimately aim to interrogate ahistorical notions of the biogeographic drivers of twentieth-century and present-day forest vegetation community structure and function within the footprint of European plantation colonialism. In Simha et al. (2022), we describe a ""diversity paradox"" in community ecology: multispecies communities are ubiquitous in nature, although many classical approaches to ecological modeling suggest that species ""should"" not coexist except under special conditions. I argue that a parallel framework exists in evolutionary biology and population genetics, framing the persistence of polymorphism despite the action of natural selection as a surprising occurrence that warrants special explanation. While classical theory expects commonly studied forms of natural selection like directional and stabilizing selection to reduce genetic variation over time (Falconer 1996), many biological processes can complicate these predictions. For example, pleiotropy, plasticity, epistasis, and demographic compensation can all complicate the mapping of genetic variation onto fitness. Similarly, geographic variation in drivers of natural selection and interactions between multiple drivers can complicate inference about responses to selection made using static estimates of selection coefficients. Finally, balancing selection can also maintain rather than deplete natural variation (Hedrick 2006, Mitchell-Olds et al. 2007). Nevertheless, predictions concerning diversifying forms of natural selection are less commonly made, and tested, when framing research about genetic polymorphism. Our work illustrates how complicating phenomena influence the evolution of genetic and phenotypic variation across the landscape. Focusing on just one polymorphism in one study species, we found that the genes controlling variation in plant secondary chemistry have pleiotropic effects on drought tolerance and anti-herbivore defense. We also found that there is plasticity in the mapping of variation in chemical biosynthesis genes onto fitness, that the magnitude and direction of selection exerted by herbivory and drought vary across fitness components, and that the net effects of these selective drivers are interactive, varying in complex ways at small spatial scales (Carley and Morris, unpublished data). Ultimately, secondary metabolites experience balancing selection that maintains variation; there is no single optimum genotype or phenotype that is consistently favored (Carley and Mitchell-Olds 2021). This work demonstrates that real-world conditions driving selection and adaptation may frequently violate simple model assumptions, and that explicit study of ""complicating factors"" may often be necessary for understanding intraspecific genetic and phenotypic variation. What we think models capture or portray, an image of what is outside (window) vs some version of ourselves (mirror), is an important aspect of the future of modeling in ecology. During the panel discussion, one question was about the role of mathematical modeling in theory as computational power becomes less limiting. As computational limitations that necessitated simpler mathematical models are dissolved, do general models become obsolete? The example the audience member provided was individual-based models (IBMs), which model individuals to understand the dynamics of populations, as opposed to modeling populations themselves. The implication of this question was that an increasing ability to compute population changes at finer-and-finer resolution is the main goal of modeling, but it's worth asking if this is truly the case. One speaker raised this issue by bringing up the short story ""On Exactitude in Science,"" which warns against the limitations of higher and higher model precision while highlighting the importance of generality in models for making sense of the world around us (Kandlikar). On the other hand, all of the speakers demonstrated how overly general theory has led us astray in making sense of the world around us by collapsing or ignoring important axes of variation. The easy take-home message from our session would be that perhaps we should sacrifice model generality in favor of precision and realism (Levins 1966). What we propose instead aligns more closely with Levins (1966)'s call for understanding nature through a multiplicity of approaches (see also Odenbaugh 2005). By ""embracing and marveling in … diversity and complexity"" (Moore), perhaps we can reframe modeling not as an effort to capture singular, generalizable truths about the natural world, nor to precisely recapitulate the complexity of nature. Instead, we might take advantage of and accept that ""all models are wrong"" in that each captures both an image of what is outside and some version of ourselves. If all models are simultaneously windows and mirrors, we can become interested in what model diversity reveals about nature (and our relation to it) rather than the pursuit of the grails of generality, precision, and realism. Another theme that emerged was a discussion about how we can better incorporate the ideas from this session into the way we teach ecology. Do we simply stop teaching ideas and models that have so deeply shaped the discipline, but that seem to reflect assumptions informed by social biases more than nature? Or, if we are not to simply abandon such ideas in the classroom, how can we better convey the sense of uncertainty and contemplation conveyed by the talks in this session? Given the outsized roles that dominant ideas (by definition) play in the historical and contemporary structure of the field, excluding them outright seems unsatisfactory. A more fruitful path forward will be to make space for discussions about the social–historical origins of ideas, their impacts on the field, and their limitations. For example, to help students better understand the history of ideas shaping community ecology, one of the speakers (Wright) introduces students to the terrestrial and theoretical ecology academic family trees ( to highlight their origins. This helps foster conversations about the cultural forces that determine the path of ""foundational"" papers, and the privilege that some authors enjoy in their efforts to disseminate their ideas. More generally, incorporating lessons from the history and philosophy of ecology, and from fields like Science & Technology Studies, in traditional ""ecology"" classrooms will help train ecologists to assess how ""mirrors"" and ""windows"" interact to shape our understanding of, and relationship with, nature. Teaching a wider range of ideas than are emphasized in most ecology texts is also essential. Several speakers highlighted the often-overlooked role of positive interactions within and between species (Wright, Bimler, Moore); more thoroughly introducing students to the diversity and importance of these interactions may ultimately help the field incorporate such interactions into our understanding of ecological communities. The last speaker (Kandlikar) advocated for more fearless experimentation in the classroom. Students' introduction to ecology in the classroom shapes the way they will approach ecological ideas throughout their lives. Embracing uncertainty and intentionally breaking dubious conventions, and sharing with students the rationale for doing so, will be an important step in developing future generations of scientists and thinkers. A unifying takeaway from our session was the importance of historicizing and interrogating assumptions and the narratives that go along with them. For example, the assumption that same-sex sexual behavior in animals incurs a fitness cost and should therefore be rare (discussed by Monk) may stem from Western, Victorian-era values of sexuality. Similarly, early modern sexual values have ""haunted"" plant biology since Linnaeus (Subramaniam and Bartlett 2023). Even in the current day, narratives of Asian plants' invasion in the United States mirror anti-Asian xenophobia, even when such characterizations belie ecological reality (Cardozo and Subramaniam 2013). We believe that putting assumptions into their historical contexts (for example by using methods suggested by Wright, Taylor (2010)) can empower ecologists to spot potential cases of ""double transference"" such as these, when social values are transposed onto nature, deemed natural, and then used to justify existing social orders (Foster et al. 2011). Drawing from allied disciplines and subdisciplines such as Black ecologies (Hare 1970, Hosbey et al. 2022), queer ecology (Mortimer-Sandilands and Erickson 2010), and Indigenous ecology (Reo and Ogden 2018, Hart-Fredeluces et al. 2021), in addition to cross-disciplinary work with art, history, and philosophy, can inspire new frames and conceptualizations through which to understand nature. Whether simplifying assumptions are maintained by colonial ideologies, historical convention, or sheer convenience, leaving our assumptions unexamined limits our understanding of nature in its expansive possibilities. We believe that ecological inquiry will be strengthened by explicit consideration of our simplifying assumptions, and their roots and consequences, as ecological theory unfolds.

https://doi.org/10.3390/ani13071264,Factor in Fear: Interference Competition in Polymorphic Spadefoot Toad Tadpoles and Its Potential Role in Disruptive Selection,"Disruptive selection arises when extreme phenotypes have a fitness advantage compared to more-intermediate phenotypes. Theory and evidence suggest that intraspecific resource competition is a key driver of disruptive selection. However, while competition can be indirect (exploitative) or direct (interference), the role of interference competition in disruptive selection has not been tested, and most models of disruptive selection assume exploitative competition. We experimentally investigated whether the type of competition affects the outcome of competitive interactions using a system where disruptive selection is common: Mexican spadefoot toads (Spea multiplicata). Spea tadpoles develop into alternative resource-use phenotypes: carnivores, which consume fairy shrimp and other tadpoles, and omnivores, which feed on algae and detritus. Tadpoles intermediate in phenotype have low fitness when competition is intense, as they are outcompeted by the specialized tadpoles. Our experiments revealed that the presence of carnivores significantly decreased foraging behavior in intermediate tadpoles, and that intermediate tadpoles had significantly lower growth rates in interference competition treatments with carnivores but not with omnivores. Interference competition may therefore be important in driving disruptive selection. As carnivore tadpoles are also cannibalistic, the 'fear' effect may have a greater impact on intermediate tadpoles than exploitative competition alone, similarly to non-consumptive effects in predator-prey or intraguild relationships.",W4362669251,True,0.983771562576294
https://doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.1507,The evolution of invasiveness: a mechanistic view of trade‐offs involving defenses,"The question of why some introduced species become invasive has captivated ecologists for more than 60 years (Elton, 1958). Many factors might contribute to invasiveness, but one of the most long-standing and persistently compelling hypotheses is that invaders benefit from escaping their enemies (Keane and Crawley, 2002). Human-mediated species introductions are inherently long-distance dispersal events, and we know that only some components of a source community are established in new locations. The species that do establish will necessarily experience a novel set of biotic interactions (Mitchell et al., 2006). If these novel interactions result in reduced fitness losses to enemies, then an incipient invader would benefit immediately, and the resulting patterns of selection could also favor evolutionary reallocation of resources away from defenses and into traits that increase reproduction and/or spread, further increasing invasiveness (Fig. 1) (Blossey and Nötzold, 1995; Joshi and Vrieling, 2005). Whether an evolutionary reduction in defenses has led to an increase in invasiveness has remained an open question in the field of invasion biology, despite many challenges and mixed support. The hypothesis was first articulated as the evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA), which combined enemy escape with optimal defense theory to predict that plant invaders will evolve increased allocation to vegetative growth or reproduction (whichever maximizes fitness in the new environment) in the absence of herbivores in their recipient communities (Blossey and Nötzold, 1995). The EICA hypothesis has since been expanded to include a broader array of enemies and greater complexity of defense interactions, but the core concept of invaders evolving increased competitive ability at the cost of defenses has remained (Joshi and Vrieling, 2005; Mitchell et al., 2006). A number of individual studies have found evidence that supports predictions of EICA, but others have not, and meta-analyses of these studies have themselves come to different conclusions about the degree of support for EICA (e.g., Chun et al., 2010; Felker-Quinn et al., 2013; Rotter and Holeski, 2018). In this essay, we argue that to test the compelling evolutionary hypotheses underlying EICA, we will be better served by reconsidering what we are measuring and how the evolution of defense traits and subsequent trade-offs can be expected to contribute to invasiveness. When Blossey and Nötzhold (1995) first proposed the EICA, they used the term ""competitive ability"" but noted that ""competitive abilities can be maximized by increasing vegetative growth or reproductive efforts depending on which is more important for success in a new environment"" (p. 887). It is essential to realize that this description, particularly by including reproduction, is really about the traits that contribute to fitness (""success"") of a lineage, not about traits that maximize competitive abilities in terms of contests between individual plants (e.g., competition coefficients). This distinction is critical for how we test the ideas underlying EICA and for how we identify invasiveness and its evolution. While invasive plants were originally characterized as species that succeed by outcompeting other plants (Elton, 1958), no doubt leading to the choice of terms in EICA, we now recognize that invasions can be the product of a variety of niche opportunities in a recipient community, which may or may not involve an important role for competitive abilities (Shea and Chesson, 2002). From the standpoint of understanding which species establish, rise to high abundance, and spread (the stages of invasion), what we should be most concerned with is not competitive ability per se but fitness traits more generally (i.e., traits related to survival and reproduction) in the new environment (Fig. 2). Reproduction (sexual or asexual) might be especially important for invasiveness, due to its relationship with both population growth and spread (Jelbert et al., 2019). Notably, in the most recent meta-analysis of EICA-type studies, Rotter and Holeski (2018) found that invading plant populations showed evidence of evolutionary increases in several growth and reproductive traits along with loss of defenses, but that these differences were strongest for reproductive traits. In seeking to test whether invasiveness has evolved as a result of enemy escape, EICA was predicated upon a simple trade-off between growth/reproduction and defense traits (Blossey and Nötzold, 1995). The regulatory mechanisms that govern plant resource use and development are being elucidated in increasing detail, and these studies generally do support the existence of deeply conserved trade-offs between these functions (Huot et al., 2014). Defense responses mediated by signalling pathways involving salicylic acid (SA), jasmonate (JA), and pathogen-associated molecular-pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) have been studied in detail and observed to result in inhibition of growth hormones and growth pathways, involving changes in transcription, translation, protein secretion, and/or the movement of carbon and nitrogen resources. This regulatory crosstalk means that even in the absence of resource limitation, defense functions can come at the cost of growth. For example, recent work has shown that JA inhibition of growth in Arabidopsis is eliminated in a mutant lacking a suite of transcriptional repressors and the photoreceptor phyB, indicating that a conserved transcriptional network and not resource limitation is responsible for growth inhibition (Campos et al., 2016). While many patterns of growth–defense trade-offs have been clearly demonstrated, less clear is how this crosstalk will scale up to whole-plant investments in defense vs. growth and fitness traits in a natural environment (Smakowska et al., 2016). A primary reason that we might not observe evolutionary changes associated with a simple trade-off between growth and defense is that plants possess many different types of defenses against their enemies, including resistance in the form of structural traits, constitutive and inducible chemical compounds, and tolerance in the form of regrowth strategies, all with the potential to operate differently in different tissues (Smakowska et al., 2016). The multifaceted nature of defense means that different defense investments could be shifted independently toward growth without a generalized loss of ""defense"" in an invasion (Joshi and Vrieling, 2005). Often, these defense investments co-occur within the same plant and are expected to trade-off against one another (Strauss et al., 2002). A comprehensive meta-analysis of multiple types of plant resistance found no overall negative association between multiple defensive traits in a plant (Koricheva et al., 2004), however, highlighting a need for a mechanistic understanding of how plants apportion resources among multiple defense investments. For example, a trade-off has classically been predicted to occur between plant tolerance (regrowth) and resistance chemistry (Leimu and Koricheva, 2006). Meta-analyses have failed to detect a negative association between tolerance and resistance (Leimu and Koricheva, 2006), however, and recent work on the mechanistic basis of tolerance has reiterated that we should revise our expectations of how tolerance and resistance can be related (Mesa et al., 2017). Specifically, some plants rapidly compensate for tissue loss through increases in the ploidy of regrowing tissues (endoreduplication), which facilitates an increase in the expression of genes and pathways that promote rapid regrowth following herbivory (Paige, 2018). Critically, recent studies in Arabidopsis thaliana have found that plant tolerance and resistance are positively correlated, because resources for both endoreduplication and secondary metabolites are produced within the same pathway (Mesa et al., 2017). Under this mechanism, a potential invader would be constrained to alter investments in both defenses concurrently, even if one was no longer needed in a given context. A recent study of invasive vines found that plant tolerance was better than resistance as a predictor of invasiveness (Ashton and Lerdau, 2007), suggesting that the relationship between these different investments could be important for invaders specifically. Colautti and Lau (2015) noted that one reason that invaders might adapt very rapidly to new locations could be that the different types of biotic interactions are simplified. By escaping some enemies, invaders might experience fewer antagonistic sources of selection and respond efficiently to the resulting directional selection, particularly if different types of defense are mechanistically coupled but experience different directions of selection in the source environment. Regardless, understanding how defense investments evolve in invaders is likely to shed light on long-standing questions about how plants evolve defense strategies under complex ecological conditions (Strauss et al., 2002) and about the conditions that favor the evolution of increased invasiveness (Fig. 2). Uncovering how defense traits are mechanistically related will be essential for generating predictions for invader evolution. Tests are needed to determine how different types of defenses trade-off against one another and against growth and fitness (Fig. 2). Understanding these more complex allocation networks within plants will allow us to more appropriately test whether changes in enemy communities do indeed create opportunities for evolutionary changes that facilitate invasion.

https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.14298,Towards closer integration between ecology and evolution,"Developing deeper links between ecology and evolution is not a new idea and has been advocating since at least the 1950s (Futuyma, 1986), but most 20th-century attempts can be considered more as rapprochement than actual integration (Huneman, 2019 for a detailed historical review). However, based on early isolated insights (e.g. Antonovics, 1976; Pimentel, 1961), the idea has been revivified over the last two decades, around the concepts of eco-evolutionary dynamics and feedbacks (Hendry, 2017). Significant efforts have indeed been made to percolate concepts and ideas between the two fields, especially across biodiversity levels (e.g. Hendry, 2017; Leibold & Chase, 2017; Loreau, 2010; Vellend, 2016), even if (i) more has been done at the population to community level than for higher levels of ecological organization (e.g. including ecosystem functioning) and (ii) analyses of reciprocal feedbacks remain rare compared to mainstream research in either field. The number of studies claiming to be ‘eco–evo’ has risen sharply (Bassar et al., 2021), even if most of these studies actually represent classical ‘eco’ or ‘evo’ approaches, raising the question of what eco–evo really is. The definition proposed by Bassar et al. (2021; see also Hendry, 2017, chapter 1) may serve as a baseline, built on the assumption that ecological and evolutionary processes occur at the same timescales because this allows for true eco-evolutionary dynamics (EED) and feedbacks. Fast global change (e.g. temperature increase; IPCC, 2023) leading to enhanced selective pressure is certainly a good reason for considering such EED, highlighting the fact that fast evolutionary dynamics can match fast environmental change (and fast biodiversity loss; Diaz & Malhi, 2022). From this definition, the debate can (and must) develop to integrate concepts, ideas and practices of ecology and evolution into EED, and this is what is proposed in this special issue (general outline in Figure 1), revivifying this debate by considering several themes: the first relies on biodiversity itself, with the idea of including all biodiversity levels (from molecule to biomes), all branches of the tree of life, and some overlooked aspects of variability. The other themes are concerned with extending the temporal (and implicitly spatial) frame in which biodiversity unfolds, considering the full range of forces and processes acting on biodiversity, and lastly revisiting concepts and extending models. Rather than commenting sequentially on each paper in this special issue, we have chosen a summary to gather the ideas and suggestions presented around these themes—all the more so as several articles contribute to multiple themes (Figure 1). They are not presented in order of importance, although some papers offer more general perspectives than others. Of course, this special issue does not exhaust the field of possibilities. Each paper suggests several avenues for further research, and we also mention (Conclusion) some additional research directions that are not considered here, but worth exploring. Biodiversity is classically considered hierarchically from molecules to ecosystems (or even biomes). While somewhat of a caricature, there is some truth in the view that the penetrance of evolutionary theory is much stronger at the level of the smallest entities (genes, populations), while ecological theories are generally more concerned with more complex entities (communities, ecosystems) (see the top left part in Figure 1). However, biodiversity levels are connected by multifarious links (e.g. selection, predation, variable environments), and EED can play a role at all levels with feedback between levels (Hendry, 2017; Loreau, 2010). This is a strong incentive to consider these dynamics across biodiversity levels. A first entry is proposed in this special issue by Yamamichi, Letten, and Schreiber (2023) who conduct an analysis of models in population genetics and community ecology following the general approach advocated by Vellend (2016): there are indeed clear parallels between, for example, selection and competition or gene flow and dispersal. They focus on the critical role of temporally fluctuating environments in maintaining variation both within and among species through fast EED. Drawing on Chesson (2000)'s theory of coexistence, they begin from a simple lottery model used in both fields to explore how the temporal storage effect affects both genetic and species diversity, incrementally complexifying this model to account for ‘reality’. This pedagogic approach may certainly be open beyond the storage effect to consider for example the respective role of genetic and ecological drift (Yamamichi, Letten, & Schreiber, 2023). The second entry, proposed by Calcagno et al. (2023), is to consider several biodiversity levels simultaneously through trophic chains. What constrains their complexity, and especially their length, is a central issue in ecology (Calcagno et al., 2011) and can be envisaged as a tension between top-down (e.g. predation) and habitat-selection effects in a metacommunity context, space being critical to account for their maintenance (Calcagno et al., 2011). Calcagno et al. (2023) introduce an ounce of evolution in this perspective, considering that dispersal rates can evolve under mutation pressure; this leads in general to longer food chains, depending on, for example, the competition-colonization trade-off among species. However, the benefit of evolution decreases when considering increasingly higher levels in food chains. Here, only dispersal evolves, and Calcagno et al. (2023) consider several worthy perspectives, such as for instance more complex descriptions of individual phenotypes than mean trait value. How dispersal evolution itself may affect the perturbation regime may also be worth taking into account for EED. A second aspect is to reconsider how the tree of life is dealt with in EED studies as well as in both ecology and evolution in general (Figure 1). To put it bluntly, microbes are overlooked, although they represent the bulk of biodiversity, and most studies are conducted on multicellular organisms (Loreau et al., 2023; Martiny et al., 2023). The point is not just that this is ‘unfair’, but that looking at the world from a microbial perspective drastically changes the meaning of eco-evolutionary dynamics. Indeed, let us imagine what the theories of ecology and evolution would have been if they had been written before the rise of multicellular organisms: disentangling ecology from evolution is difficult in the microbial realm if it even has any meaning. Indeed, the species concept poorly applies, and horizontal gene transfers are common, even if microbial Operational Taxonomic Units within communities are separated by much larger distances than in macro-organisms (Martiny et al., 2023). The fundamental differences made in macro-organisms between changes in species abundance and in genotype frequencies are therefore blurred. Microbes, no less than macro-organisms, can respond to environmental change with solutions going from rapid evolution to broad-scale community shifts, going up to those biogeochemical processes governing ecosystem functioning and dynamics, which implies a strong potential to lead to EED (Martiny et al., 2023). However, they are not indistinct players collectively expressing functional redundancy, and we should now dig deeper into their ecology and evolution in natural environments to fully make sense of their role. Recent work has shown that it is for example possible to quantify dispersal and evaluate its impact on decomposition processes in soils (Martiny et al., 2023). The last aspect regarding biodiversity is some facets of variability, within and among species, that have been overlooked in EED (Figure 1). Variability is needed for evolution to proceed, and its maintenance is a central issue in both evolution and ecology, in particular as a resilience mechanism under unpredictable environmental conditions. Variance is certainly a key concept in ecological studies above the species level but has been essentially considered among species (Violle et al., 2012). Yet, we are not short of studies analysing trait variance within species in population biology. However, studies assessing rates of phenotypic change focus on population mean trait values, while their variance might be as significant for EED. Contributing to filling this gap is the goal of Sanderson et al. (2023), based on a compilation of both trait means and variances measured in context of environmental changes. Means and variances are globally positively correlated, and the distribution of genetic and phenotypic variances is also very similar. No general patterns for phenotypic variance emerge among different types of environmental changes, or traits, rendering prediction of future phenotypic trends difficult. Sanderson et al. (2023) conclude that much has still to be done to build more ambitious datasets on a wide range of organisms, but also to link this variance to environmental variance, a pre-requisite to EED studies. Part of this variance is due to phenotypic plasticity, and here again, a plethora of studies have been conducted (Pfennig, 2021). However, how phenotypic plasticity can contribute to EED through propagating effects in ecological networks remains to be evaluated. Gómez et al. (2023) explore more specifically in this special issue how plasticity contributes to expand or shift the interaction niche, or even cause the colonization of new niches. This may lead to the topology of ecological networks being rewired, an aspect that is open to empirical evaluation through metrics such as nestedness or modularity. That individual plasticity may percolate to affect various key characteristics of networks confronted with environmental perturbations, such as resistance to invasions, is an interesting perspective (Gómez et al., 2023). Whether plasticity may be defined at network scale and submitted to selection is more contentious. A full analysis should also specify how plasticity may drive EED in actual cases. Perhaps, more ambitious is the idea of considering stoichiometry as a key part of variability (El-Sabaawi et al., 2023)—ecological stoichiometry studies how the relative supply and demand of essential elements, such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, influence biological interactions (Elser et al., 2000). It contributed largely to our understanding of ecosystem functioning (Van de Waal et al., 2018), but not so much to EED. Here, El-Sabaawi et al. (2023) propose to develop organismal stoichiometry to access an understudied aspect of the phenotype. This ‘elemental phenotype’ integrates body elemental content, and how these elements are acquired, assimilated, allocated or released and exhibits much intraspecific variation, leading to selective pressures. Beyond providing a direct link between population biology and fluxes of matter in ecosystems, this idea opens connections to the notion of functional traits (Loranger et al. 2016), also considered integrators between ecological and evolutionary processes (Hendry, 2017), as well as to a whole body of evolutionary theory on resource allocation (Charnov, 1993; Stearns, 1992). The ‘elemental phenotype’ perspective includes connections with species interactions as well, and therefore, a wide range of ecological processes through cascading effects in trophic chains. Bassar et al. (2021) argued that genuine eco-evo dynamics can only unfold when ecology and evolution proceed at the same timescale. However, they implicitly assumed that both were fast because they focused on ongoing processes. Fronhofer et al. (2023) enlarge the picture by extending the idea to any timescale and considering the dynamics of biological systems in a two-dimensional space—the two axes representing respectively the speed of ecology and evolution (Figure 1). In this framework, ecology and evolution sensu stricto can be redefined by their relative speed with regard to evolution and ecology respectively (Figure 1). More importantly, this means that change of states in Figure 1 can occur whenever modulators modify ecological and evolutionary rates—such modulators can be factors external to the biological systems (e.g. environmental temperature) or internal to them (e.g. new genetic variation, itself influenced by external factors). EED may therefore emerge when rate modulators synchronize the speed of ecology and evolution. This framework also extends Hutchinson (1965)'s analogy (the ecological theatre and the evolutionary play): time is the theatre in which ecology and evolution are two interacting players. Fronhofer et al. (2023)'s proposal undermines the usual ‘slow evolution/fast ecology' wisdom that served for decades as a ‘good reason’ for not considering ecology and evolution together. It also calls for reconsidering the ‘time-scale separation’ classically used in EED models based, for example, on the adaptive dynamics approach (see Calcagno et al., 2023). This approach considers weak selection on traits and assumes that evolution is much slower than ecology in order to facilitate model analysis (Calcagno et al., 2023; Lion et al., 2023; Yamamichi, Letten, & Schreiber, 2023). The new approach to trait modelling—oligomorphic dynamics—by Lion et al. (2023, detailed below) is a way of overcoming this problem while addressing the question of eco–evo prediction at temporal scales beyond the few generations that quantitative genetics can offer. A significant contribution, no doubt, to predicting EED under a regime of rapid environmental change. Yamamichi, Ellner, and Hairston (2023) argue that evolution in EED studies has too often focused on a reduced set of forces (i.e. strong selection, negligible phenotypic variances, large genetic effects on ecological variables; see Bassar et al., 2021). They discuss several aspects that should be deepened, insisting on the role of mutation and genetic drift. For example, we know that deleterious mutations can drive populations to extinction (mutational meltdown; Lynch et al., 1995), but the role of genetic drift remains to be sorted out to fully understand how ‘evolution may save’ populations when environmental variation drives down demography (evolutionary rescue). Yamamichi, Ellner, and Hairston (2023) also point out that too much emphasis has been put on directional and balancing selection (Figure 1), and not enough on disruptive selection (see also Lion et al., 2023). Assuming similar speeds for evolution and ecology, an open question is how lineage diversification (or even fusing after diversification) is affected by disruptive selection, both in the short- and long-term, providing a link between microevolution and macroevolution (see also Fronhofer et al., 2023). As mentioned above, temporal variation (and the storage effect; Yamamichi, Letten, & Schreiber, 2023) and phenotypic plasticity (Gómez et al., 2023) are also critical processes to be considered. The modulators of ecological and evolutionary rates introduced by Fronhofer et al. (2023) provide a general umbrella term to account for the fact that we should consider not only those forces and processes but also the speed at which they may change. In this approach to EDD through forces and processes (Figure 1), Kim et al. (2023) propose another, more applied, angle of attack, based on an arguably contentious issue, that is, the use of gene drive technology to introduce genes of interest into natural populations. The argument is simple: the spread of genes should be so fast that it can occur over timescales similar to many ecological processes, as in situations where there is strong selection. Kim et al. (2023) describe the key forces and processes that should be accounted for in future studies, for example, population structure or the rise of gene drive in other species on the evolutionary side and environmental variation on the ecological side. The strong economic pressure to release these technologies from the laboratory into the field certainly calls for an EED approach to better understand and manage the associated risks. Considering other forces and processes in the previous section (Yamamichi, Ellner, & Hairston, 2023) is certainly a call to develop new models of EED. We already saw the conceptual gain derived from considering the possibility that the colonization rate can evolve in models of food-chain length (Calcagno et al., 2023), and how models can be derived from analogous forces at both the population and community levels to account for the temporal storage effect (Yamamichi, Letten, & Schreiber, 2023). What Lion et al. (2023) propose is perhaps even more ambitious by opening a door to integrate the two major theoretical approaches used to model traits and their evolution, namely adaptive dynamics (AD) and quantitative genetics (QG). In a simplified presentation, QG assumes that traits have a normal distribution, and AD often results in bivariate distributions. To get rid of the Gaussian straitjacket and drawing on Sasaki and Dieckmann (2011), Lion et al. (2023) introduce ‘oligomorphic dynamics’—the basic idea is to decompose a multimodal trait distribution into a sum of narrow unimodal distributions, each peak corresponding to a morph and being characterized by its frequency and statistical moments (Figure 1). This elegant approach, developed here using simple models, displays several advantages, among others the possibility to consider EED at much larger timescale than QG or to account for the dynamical nature of genetic variance. It can also take into account population regulation through frequency- and density-dependent selection induced by environmental change (see also Yamamichi, Letten, & Schreiber, 2023). Lion et al. (2023) also suggest that this approach should facilitate a much tighter integration between eco-evolutionary theory and empirical data. Much exciting work in perspective! Advances in the eco-evolutionary field could also come from the judicious extension of concepts from ecology and evolution. For example, Nosil et al. (2021)) suggested that resilience, a concept borrowed from ecosystem studies (Holling, 1973), can fruitfully be used to analyse the stability of evolutionary systems. Here, Loreau et al. (2023) go the other way around by showing that adaptation, a concept typically associated with evolutionary theory, could be considered above the species level (Figure 1). The idea is to generalize adaptation to any process that results in improved performance as a response to environmental change in a multilevel hierarchical perspective. Loreau et al. (2023) consider facets of this certainly contentious idea, such as how to measure performance (fitness in evolutionary parlance) and its connection with group and multi-level selection. Perhaps, the idea might be even more relevant to unicellular organisms, given the blurred boundaries between their ecology and evolution (Loreau et al., 2023; Martiny et al., 2023). The border between ecology and evolution is a vast domain, and this special issue of course did not explore it fully. Here, we sketch out a few further directions and themes that could fruitfully be pursued. First, technological tools (e.g. omics and environmental sensors/probes) used by evolutionary biologists and ecologists are serving as common objects for a dialogue between the two communities. Although they were not covered explicitly here, the idea runs through most papers of the special issue. Second, fitness is the currency used in evolutionary biology and energy that is used by the most functional parts of ecology. Rather abstract frameworks have been proposed to link fitness and energy (entropy) in evolutionary biology (e.g. Frank, 2009). The approach of Brown et al. (2018), connecting energy use, traits and environment, is open to empirical evaluation, and might be pursued for understanding EED. Third, micro-organisms represent interactive interfaces between macro-organisms and their environment, which is encapsulated in the holobiont concept (Simon et al., 2019). Both evolutionary and ecological paradigms are required to make sense of holobiont dynamics with echoes here in the contributions of Loreau et al. (2010) and Martiny et al. (2023), for example, on the notion of transmission units. Last, but not least, biodiversity management in a world of very fast and deleterious environmental changes should harness an eco-evolutionary framework and perspective (Sarrazin & Leconte, 2016), not only to manage the current problems but also to offer some hope for the future.

https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.1999.00359.x,Systemic acquired resistance: available information and open ecological questions,"1 How widespread is SAR within the plant kingdom? 2 Does SAR fit into the framework provided by established theories on plant (anti-herbivore) defence? 3 What are the allocation costs and ultimately the fitness costs of SAR? 4 Why is SAR an inducible and not a constitutive defence? 5 What is the advantage of a defence induced systemically by a single pathogen, which then gives resistance against many others that are not yet causing any problems and which probably may never challenge the regarded plant? 6 Are there any functional or physiological relations between SAR and other biological interactions, for example mutualisms between plants and micro-organisms? 7 Do plants exist in nature that are older than seedlings that have not already been induced? The many excellent reviews on the molecular aspects of SAR include those by Ryals et al. (1994), Hunt & Ryals (1996), Hunt et al. (1996), Ryals et al. (1996) and Schneider et al. (1996), and only a short overview is given here, before considering the ecological possibilities. Indeed, simply applying established ecological theories and models to the phenomenon (for example, examining SAR within the concept of fitness costs) may shed new light on this important type of plant defence. Infection by bacteria, viruses or fungi, induces many plant species to synthesize a signal at the site of infection, which then spreads systemically throughout the plant. This leads to the expression of a broad-spectrum, long-lasting immunity in both infected and non-infected plant parts. Initially, this phenomenon was thought to be ubiquitous, and resistance was thought to be equally effective against many different pathogens (Ryals et al. 1994; Jackson & Taylor 1996 and literature cited therein), but more recent studies suggest intra-and interspecific variability (see later). The systemic reaction involves the production of chitinases, β-(1,3)-glucanases, lysozyme, permatins, and at least two more classes of so-called pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins (Ryals et al. 1996; Schneider et al. 1996) which may protect against further infections. Chitinases are particularly effective against several pathogenic fungi (Boller et al. 1983; Schlumbaum et al. 1986; Sahai & Manocha 1993), and the efficacy of SAR against a variety of bacteria, viruses and fungi has also been demonstrated convincingly (Boller et al. 1983; Hoffland et al. 1996; Anfoka & Buchenauer 1997; further literature cited in Schneider et al. 1996). A main characteristic of SAR is that the induced defence does not depend directly on the type of inducing pathogen. For example, pretreatment with bacteria (Pseudomonas fluorescens strain WCS417) protected radish (Raphanus sativus, Brassicaceae) against a fungal root pathogen as well as a bacterial and two different fungal leaf pathogens (Hoffland et al. 1996), and inoculation of tomato plants with tobacco necrosis virus elicited resistance against the fungus Phytophthora infestans (Oomyceta) (Anfoka & Buchenauer 1997). The PR proteins produced in response to pathogens can also be induced by the plant hormone ethylene (Linthorst et al. 1996), or by stress, including mechanical wounding (Ignatius et al. 1994). SAR can also be induced experimentally by the application of certain chemicals, most notably salicylic acid (SA) and benzothiadiazole (Friedrich et al. 1996; Görlach et al. 1996; Lawton et al. 1996). Although the induction of chitinases and β-(1,3)-glucanases by the stress hormone ethylene has been shown in several plant species (Boller et al. 1983; Vierheilig et al. 1994 and literature cited therein), the pathway leading from a first and locally restricted infection to the systemic response is not yet well understood. SA seems to be involved in this transduction (Malamy et al. 1990; Métraux et al. 1990; Delaney et al. 1994; Hunt et al. 1996; Thulke & Conrath 1998) but it may not be the primary transported signal (Rasmussen et al. 1991; Vernooij et al. 1994; Willits & Ryals 1998), although SA can indeed be synthesized in one leaf and translocated to the next (Shualev et al. 1995; Mölders et al. 1996). It has also been shown to inhibit catalase activity, and elevated levels of H2O2 could thus function as the second messenger (Chen et al. 1993). However, the absence of any increase of H2O2 in uninfected leaves at the onset of SAR gene activation, and the phytotoxic levels needed for SAR induction (Hunt et al. 1996; discussed in Schneider et al. 1996), together with the high reactivity of H2O2, make it rather improbable that this component is translocated over large distances. Although parts of the signalling pathway seem to be highly conserved in evolution, and thus occur in all plant species so far investigated (e.g. in Arabidopsis as well as in tobacco), the type, amount and time–course of the response depends on the precise identity of both partners (Schneider & Ullrich 1994; Schneider et al. 1996; Botha et al. 1998). Thus SAR gene expression was first detected in tobacco about 6 days after inoculation (Ryals et al. 1994), but as early as 7 hours after a primary infection in cucumber (Schneider et al. 1996): in both species, patterns in the activity of the various hydrolytic enzymes depended on the inducer (Schneider & Ullrich 1994). Variation occurs in particular with respect to the efficacy of defence. For example, Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes vary in their resistance to cauliflower mosaic virus (Callaway et al. 1996), and nim 1 mutants (non-inducible immunity) differ in PR-1 production, while eds (enhanced disease susceptibility) mutants have distinguishable phenotypes with respect to the susceptibility to pathogenic bacteria. Some lines of barley differ in their ability to produce chitinases and glucanases (Ignatius et al. 1994; Hunt & Ryals 1996; Hunt et al. 1997; Rogers & Ausubel 1997; Ryals et al. 1997; Shah et al. 1997). The various chitinases that occur within the same species may differ in location, activity, chitin-binding property and catalytic mechanism, and thus allow the plant to match many different requirements (Sahai & Manocha 1993; Iseli et al. 1996). β-(1,3)-glucanase, ribosome-inactivating proteins and permatins may also occur in the form of several isozymes (Darnetty et al. 1993). Genes for some proteins belonging to the PR-1 subfamily may be expressed continuously, at least in shoot meristems and trichomes (Tornero et al. 1997). As shoot meristems are especially valuable and vulnerable, whereas trichomes in most plants are involved in defence mechanisms, this finding may be interpreted as a hint on relevant costs of SAR (see below). Of 45 research articles or meeting abstracts on SAR published during 1996 and 1997, 24 were conducted using Arabidopsis or tobacco as the model organism, another 13 referred to cucumber, potato or tomato, and only eight presented data derived from other species; the 25 earlier papers listed by Schneider et al. (1996) describe a total of 17 plant species. A similarly restricted picture is apparent from the literature on chitinase (overviewed by Sahai & Manocha 1993). The vast majority of these species are short-lived and fast-growing annuals, but known SAR markers, direct measurements of enzyme activities, or bioassays could be used to investigate the frequency of SAR in a wide range of species. So far, predominantly chitinase activity has been demonstrated for plants with other life histories, e.g. Urtica dioca (a chitinase of stinging nettle was characterized genetically by Lerner & Raikhel 1992), the rubber-tree Hevea brasiliensis (van Parijs et al. 1991) or poplar Populus sp. (Clarke et al. 1998). Information is needed on the time taken to establish SAR as well as the production and persistence of SAR-related mRNA and proteins after a single challenging infection. Data from a few annual species are insufficient to evaluate the adaptivity and ecological importance of SAR, or to determine whether plants with different life histories (e.g. annuals compared to long-lived trees) differ in their response. SAR is studied mainly in the context of plant–pathogen interactions, but may also be relevant to mutualistic interactions. Recent papers reported an induction of SAR by non-pathogenic root-colonizing bacteria (Pieterse et al. 1996; Raupach et al. 1996; van Wees et al. 1997), although the establishment of vesicular-arbuscular (VA)-mycorrhizas seems not to induce systemic reactions in host-plants (Vierheilig et al. 1994; Lange et al. 1996). SAR in cucumber and Arabidopsis has also been reported to be induced by compost and compost water extracts, an effect destroyed by autoclaving the compost mix and therefore most probably caused by soil-living micro-organisms (Zhang et al. 1998). This observation in particular leads to the question of whether any plant does exist in nature that has not already been induced by the influence of either abiotic or biotic agents. Mutual symbioses with endophytic fungi that have evolved in several grasses and trees participate in the plants' anti-herbivore defence by providing secondary metabolites, especially neurotoxic alkaloids (Clay 1990). However, little is known about the interactions between the defence mechanisms established during SAR and mutualistic endosymbionts, but it is likely that the considerable indirect cost of SAR will result from its antagonistic effects on mutualistic organisms. Can intra- and interspecific patterns in type, extent and time-course of SAR be accounted for by existing theories of chemical defence in plants, which in most cases are formulated as an anti-herbivore response? In contrast to the human immune system in which specific antibodies are produced as a reaction to each distinct antigen, SAR – once induced by a single pathogen – provides protection against a range of different pathogenic organisms. It is difficult to understand, given the evidence for continuous PR gene expression (Tornero et al. 1997), why a first – and probably severe – infection is required rather than systemic resistance being constitutive. A model proposed by Karban et al. (1997) points out that induced chemical defence may be more effective against herbivores than constitutive resistance. Small amounts of toxin may hardly reduce the herbivore's benefit from feeding on plant tissue, but increasing toxin levels may cause a progressively greater decrease in benefit at higher levels. The authors demonstrated mathematically that, in this case, variable toxin levels will lead to a lower benefit for the herbivore than the continuous presence of the corresponding mean level. Plants differ in their level of constitutive and inducible defence against pathogens (Keen 1992), and the applicability of this model to SAR could therefore be tested by quantifying the effects on the fitness of both plants and pathogens for host-plant species with different levels of inducible defence. Most theories on plant defence, however, assume that there will be a cost to fitness resulting from the production of defence chemicals or structures, which at least must be balanced by the resulting benefit. Inducible defence may thus reduce the overall costs by producing chemicals only when their function is actually required. Ecological costs should ideally be measured as reduction in fitness, i.e. fewer offspring will be produced because of the operation of the trait considered (Simms & Rausher 1987; Marquis 1991; Sagers & Coley 1995). Although, at least in long-lived species, fitness costs are hard to quantify directly (Chapin 1989), several studies have demonstrated that fitness costs may be estimated by measuring reduction in growth rates (Coley 1986; Sagers & Coley 1995; Steinberg 1995 for empirical studies; Skogsmyr & Fagerström 1992 for a theoretical model). Because resources invested in one distinct trait are no longer available for other functions such as reproduction, fitness costs may be estimated in terms of allocation costs, for example by calculating energy and construction costs (Penning de Vries et al. 1974; Gulmon & Mooney 1986; Skogsmyr & Fagerström 1992; Gershenzon 1994; Griffin 1994; Simms & Triplett 1994) or simply by quantifying the allocation of limited resources such as nitrogen (Evans & Black 1993). To my knowledge, only three studies have so far been published that attempt to quantify the costs of resistance against pathogens, and their results do not allow any generalization about the possible costs of SAR. Simms & Triplett (1994) were not able to detect fitness costs of resistance of Ipomoea spp. to anthracnose, nor could Simms & Vision (1995) prove direct allocation costs of localized resistance of young Ipomoea plants. In an attempt to use reduction in germination success to quantify the costs of anti-fungal resistance to different Avena fatua lines, Burdon & Müller (1987) obtained contradictory results from their greenhouse and field studies. However, SAR can be induced chemically in wheat by application of BION® (benzo (1,2,3) thiadiazole-7-thio-carbonic acid S-methyl ester; NOVARTIS, Basel, Switzerland) (Friedrich et al. 1996; Görlach et al. 1996; Lawton et al. 1996), and preliminary results from field studies (M. Heil, personal observations) show that treatment of plants with BION reduced the number of seeds produced. Data from several Macaranga species, which have evolved obligate or facultative mutualisms with ants to protect them continuously and very effectively against herbivory and secondary infections (Fiala et al. 1989, 1994), offer similar hints as to the costs of SAR. Chitinase activities were lower in three Macaranga species than in species from other genera that show no mutualistic interactions with ants. Macaranga plants thus seem to have a remarkably low ability to produce at least one class of PR proteins, and no costs are incurred by the production of compounds that are not required in these plants due to the effective anti-herbivore and anti-fungal defence provided by the ants (Heil et al. 1999). The 'optimal defence' hypothesis (Rhoades 1979) assumes that defence is most important and thus should be most intensive in those parts that are most valuable to the plant, such as young leaves and shoot meristems. In contrast, the 'growth-differentiation balance' hypothesis (Herms & Mattson 1992) assumes a metabolic competition between processes involved in plant growth and 'differentiation' processes necessary for, for example, the synthesis of defence chemicals. This competition should reduce the resources available to defend still growing tissues, and young leaves and shoot meristems should therefore be the least defended parts of a plant. The production of SAR-related proteins instead of proteins that are relevant for growth, the diversion of products of the shikimic acid pathway (Schneider & Ullrich 1994) to synthesize anti-bacterial phenolic compounds rather than aromatic amino acids, and enhanced lignification as reported by Hammerschmidt & Kuc (1982) and Barber et al. (1989), suggest that SAR may incur costs in terms of competition for limited resources. The clear set of physiological data given by Herbers et al. (1996) allows the two theories to be evaluated. The induction of PR protein transcripts in tobacco leaf discs floated on solutions of different sugars depended strongly on leaf developmental stage. Older leaves were highly inducible, while the same concentration of sugars failed to elicit a clear response in leaves that were not yet fully unfolded. It is difficult to use source–sink relationships to explain why only those leaves that produce high amounts of sugars by photosynthesis should be able to use these sugars as signal molecules, but according to the hypothesis of Herms & Mattson (1992) young, still growing, leaves may just be unable to produce PR proteins simply because their whole metabolic apparatus is needed for the biosynthesis of growth-relevant proteins. At least for this example, the 'optimal defence' hypothesis, which would predict high defence levels especially in the young leaves, can be discounted. Further studies using different inductors and comparing their efficacy in dependence on leaf age and developmental stage are needed, however. Unlike SAR, studies on chemical anti-herbivore defence have so far mainly focused on ecological problems and cost–benefit models rather than signalling pathways and resulting gene activities (Hammerschmidt 1993). However, the signalling pathway of SAR, and the octadecanoid pathway (Doares et al. 1995) which is involved in induced resistance against herbivores, may interact. Jasmonic acid, a central signal of the octadecanoid pathway, is produced within a few minutes after insect feeding (Blechert et al. 1995) and leads to an activation of several defence genes (Doares et al. 1995). The application of jasmonic acid also induces the production of PR proteins and therefore resistance against phytopathogens (Cohen et al. 1993; Schweizer et al. 1993). Although salicylic acid can lead to enhanced resistance of cotton to both insects and phytopathogens (Khoshkhoo et al. 1993), Bi et al. (1997) failed to identify SA as a signal in the anti-herbivore defence of this species, and Korth & Dixon (1997) also demonstrated that pathways leading to anti-herbivore defence are not activated by abiotic damage. In this case, an ecological point of view can again provide a framework for understanding the physiological findings. In nature, herbivore attack or mechanical wounding often leads to secondary pathogen attack, and using primary wounding as a signal for the induction of SAR enables the plant to be prepared for probable secondary pathogen attacks. On the other hand, herbivores seldom use heavily infected plant parts as a food source, and induction of anti-herbivore defence by signals derived from pathogen attack would therefore probably lead to the synthesis of superfluous defence molecules. Progress in ecology essentially needs testable theories as well as pluralism and diversity in new approaches (Weiner 1995). The application of specialized theories to a broader spectrum of findings often paves the way for rapid scientific developments, and the combination of formerly separated scientific disciplines can also result in new insights. Integration of SAR into ecological field research should thus provide the possibility for successful further research. I wish to thank my supervisor, K.E. Linsenmair, University of Würzburg, for allowing the time necessary to spend on the literature search and on conducting the field studies on SAR. Many thanks also to K.E. Linsenmair, B. Fiala, W.

Haddon, for kindly improving my English. revision accepted 17 October 1998 Received 20 February 1998",W1969554681,True,0.9511252045631409
https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.02077,Phenological change and ecological interactions: an introduction,"Phenology – the seasonal timing of life history events – is of fundamental importance for many ecological interactions. Direct interactions between organisms such as pollination, competitive contests and predation require overlap in time between interacting life stages. By controlling when during the year individuals are active and available for others as partners, competitors or food resources, phenology thus sets the stage for whether or not such interactions can take place at all. Phenology can also influence interactions quantitatively: with larger temporal overlap between two interacting species their interaction can be expected to become stronger or more probable. From an ecological point of view, investigating phenology is therefore a key to understanding functional aspects of communities and the inner workings of ecosystems. From an evolutionary point of view, timing of a seasonal event can be considered as a type of heritable trait, similar to other life-history traits. As such, it is subject to natural selection, and ecological interactions are potentially important selective forces influencing its evolution. Regardless of whether the focus is on ecology or evolution, studying phenology is fascinating because it is a very general characteristic of populations – the temporal component of their life history that can easily be observed by professionals as well as amateurs. Because phenological traits are expressed by many different types of species and in many different types of activities, they allow for direct comparisons across taxa and ecosystems. Recent climate change has accentuated the need to better understand the ecological and evolutionary implications of phenology. Significant changes in phenology have been observed in many systems across the world and form one of the most well-documented ecological footprints of global warming (Parmesan 2006). Phenological data continues to accumulate in ongoing, large-scale monitoring programs as well as through discoveries of historical archives and increasingly refined methods to monitor changes (Hudson et al. 2010). Although the general ecological implications of changing phenology remain to a large extent unknown, some studies have indicated effects of phenological change on fitness components or population dynamics. How shall we interpret these patterns – do phenological shifts signify growing mismatches with environmental conditions or are they adaptive responses? What are the ecological consequences of phenological change – which species will benefit and which will lose? What are the indirect effects when perturbations owing to phenological shifts propagate through food webs and communities? With the aim of advancing our knowledge on these topics, we invited ecologists with expertise in phenology or theoretical ecology to contribute to this special issue. In particular we wanted to shed light on the interplay between phenology and ecological interactions from different perspectives, resulting in contributions representing a diverse range of scientific approaches, from field studies and experiments to theoretical investigations based on network theory, game theory, population dynamics and life history theory. The contributions furthermore include original research as well as reviews and conceptual papers that provide overview and synthesis. The first six papers focus on how phenology influences ecological interactions. Forrest (2015) reviews empirical research on phenological change in plant–pollinator interactions. The paper highlights that phenological shifts have been observed in a range of systems, but while fitness effects on plants have been documented, less is known about the consequences for pollinators. Several promising avenues for future observational and experimental research are outlined and the author stresses that we need to evaluate the relative importance of mismatch compared to other effects of climate change. Rafferty et al. (2015) put forward a framework to predict the likelihood of phenological mismatch in mutualistic interactions in general. They argue that while a relatively large amount of attention has been given to plant–pollinator interactions, the implications of phenological shifts for other types of mutualisms are poorly understood. Specifically they identify three key characteristics that indicate a high risk of mismatch among mutualists. Two of the characteristics 1) a non-symbiotic life history in which co-dispersal is absent, and 2) brief, seasonal interactions, receive some support from data, whereas it is harder to establish the effect of 3) facultative, generalized, interactions. The study by Revilla et al. (2015) considers phenological shifts in mutualistic interactions in spatially distributed communities. By analyzing a model based on network theory, they show that habitat destruction and phenological changes can act synergistically and lead to catastrophic losses of diversity within meta-communities. They identify critical levels of destruction above which all plants and pollinators go extinct and show that such thresholds are lower when phenological shifts weaken the interaction strengths. With the following paper by Cleland et al. (2015) we shift the focus from mutualistic to competitive interactions. Specifically, they study how timing of germination influences competition between plant species by giving rise to priority effects benefiting the earlier germinating species. The study is motivated by observations of plant invasions in southern California showing that successful exotic species are often active earlier in the season than native species. They suggest that as the impact of priority effects varies among species pairs, these effects may be an important factor to consider in efforts to restore native vegetation. This is followed by a paper by Bennett et al. (2015) who study how timing of egg-laying, jointly with other factors including how high on the host plant the eggs are deposited and herbivory, influences adaptation of a butterfly species, Euphydryas editha, to new climate conditions. The authors argue that this species does not need to shift its range to cope with climate change and should have higher resilience than expected of such a climate-sensitive species. The reason is that females have several options to mitigate increasing temperatures. They can advance their phenology and thereby avoid high temperatures later in the season, altering host species, and/or change their oviposition microsite. A more dramatic outcome of climate change includes developmental traps, as discussed by Van Dyck et al. (2015). The butterfly, Lasiommata megera, a species with several non-overlapping generations per year studied by Van Dyck et al., might respond to higher temperatures by initiating an additional generation towards the end of the season. In some cases, this may prove detrimental as the butterfly may then not have sufficient time to complete the full generational cycle. At this point the focus for the papers changes from the ecological implications of variation in phenology to the evolution of phenology. Specifically the next four papers consider how ecological interactions influence natural selection of phenology and how that in turn may influence adaptive responses of phenology in a changing environment. Day and Kokko (2015) study selection on timing of migration among birds in a climate change scenario where food resources for offspring appear earlier in the season. They highlight that when there is competition for territories with prior residence advantages and if a phenological mismatch with the food resources causes the population to decline, then the evolutionary response might be weak. The reason is that selection to arrive early to match the advancing food peak can be counteracted by reduced selection to compete for territories. The paper by Schmidt et al. (2015) considers phenological adaptation of migratory birds as well. However, compared to the previous paper they also consider an additional interaction, namely nest predation and the focal phenological trait is prospecting time for predator cues on breeding grounds. A key finding is that the adaptive response to deteriorating environmental conditions, e.g. due to climate change, is to increase prospecting time, owing to reduced competition for nest sites. Several other links between information gathering, spatial heterogeneity, productivity and predation risk are revealed as well. In the next paper, Reed et al. (2015) study how intraspecific competition, and subsequent density-dependence, influence micro-evolutionary responses of the timing of breeding of consumer species in relation to seasonally varying food availability. They find that the rate of population recovery increases with stronger density dependence. The study also highlights that increasing the strength of stabilizing selection on phenology increases the rate of microevolution while at the same time increasing the demographic cost of directional selection. The conceptual paper by Ehrlén (2015) considers how interspecific interactions along with life-history tradeoffs influence selection on timing of flowering in iteroparous plants. The author applies life history theory to this problem and stresses the need to take into account correlations of events within a season, interactions that may occur before, during or after the flowering phase of the plant as well as inter-annual variation in selection pressures. It is also argued that the evidence for antagonist-mediated selection is stronger than pollinator-mediated selection on flowering time. In the final paper (Johansson et al. 2015) we review theoretical approaches to understand phenological adaptations and the fitness consequences of phenological shifts. While synchrony in relation to interacting species is a commonly expected evolutionary outcome and the very basis for much research on phenology, we discuss different ecological mechanisms and features of life cycles that, according to recent theory, are expected to cause deviations from synchrony and the implications thereof. In this way the paper also provides a synthetic overview of available alternative hypotheses for interpreting empirical patterns of phenological change. The contributed papers are part of a growing research area concerned with investigating the links between phenological change and ecological interactions. They fill significant knowledge gaps and give a snapshot of the current research landscape, as well as serving as an introduction to this exciting field. The thematic issue can furthermore be seen as a complement to previous research promoted by Oikos that shed light on spatial dimensions in ecology (e.g. thematic issues edited by Bonte et al. 2012 and Kubisch and Fronhofer 2014). As argued by Kubisch et al. (2014) it is often critical to consider biotic interactions when interpreting species ranges, rather than only taking into account abiotic factors, as has traditionally been the case in biogeographic research. In a similar way, the present issue emphasizes that ecological interactions can play an important role in shaping the timing of seasonal events, and this adds an important aspect to climatological approaches to phenology (Menzel et al. 2006). Range shifts and phenological change are regarded as the most well documented effects of recent climate change (Parmesan 2006), however adding knowledge about the role of ecological interactions may prove crucial for meeting future challenges of for example conservation and ecosystem services. In the spirit of synthesis, a natural continuation of these efforts might be to consider spatial and temporal dimensions of ecological interactions jointly. It has for example been argued that phenology is a key determinant of ranges of tree species (Chuine 2010). The two dimensions are closely intertwined in some phenomena such as bird migration (Duriez et al. 2012). In this issue interesting interactions between phenological interactions and spatial processes (dispersal in a metacommunity) are revealed by Revilla et al. (2015). Shifting phenology and shifting range are also two non-exclusive options for species to adapt to changing climates (Bennett et al. 2015) and only by considering them jointly we can evaluate their relative importance and likelihood. Oikos is an ideal platform for research exploring these themes further. We thank all the contributing authors for their commitment and efforts.

https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13182,Towards a mechanistic understanding of global change ecology,"The 21st century is, by most metrics, a great time to be a human. Relative to other periods in human history, life expectancies, living standards and educational levels are the highest they have ever been. But these advances in human welfare have come at great cost to the nonhuman cohabitants of our planet. CO2 levels continue to increase, as do global temperatures, altering global rainfall patterns, fire frequencies and many other aspects of the environment that directly affect communities and ecosystems. Our changing climate currently receives extensive attention in the media and in the ecological literature, but it is just one of the many ways that humans influence communities and ecosystems. Human land-use (Figure 1), resulting in habitat destruction, fragmentation and urbanization, is one of the most significant, probably the most significant, causes of biodiversity loss globally (Haddad et al., 2015; Newbold et al., 2015). Other human-mediated changes to communities, such as the introduction of novel species (Powell, Chase, & Knight, 2013), high inputs of nitrogen (Bobbink et al., 2010), agricultural intensification (Fahrig et al., 2011) and interactions among these, have dramatically changed patterns of biodiversity and ecological processes on our planet. To understand how organisms, communities and ecosystems are responding, and will respond, to the array environmental changes caused by human modification of the planet, researchers have taken a variety of approaches. One approach is to model relationships between climatic variation and current or past species distributions and extrapolate from these models to predict how populations and communities will change under different climate change scenarios. But scenario-driven forecasts of this type take decades to test and are limited to predicting how climatic niches and large-scale habitat distributions will change in response to climate (Franklin, Serra-Diaz, Syphard, & Regan, 2016). Predicting how global change will affect individual species, biodiversity within ecosystems, and the services those ecosystems provide, requires understanding of the specific mechanisms by which human-caused ecological changes influence ecological interactions that affect ecosystem function. In this issue of Functional Ecology, we present a collection of review and perspective papers that examine the mechanisms underlying how organisms, communities and ecosystems respond to a variety of global changes. This special feature grew out of a symposium held at the annual meeting of the British Ecological Society in Liverpool, UK, in December 2016. That symposium, a celebration of Functional Ecology's 30th anniversary as a journal and the publication of volume 30 of the journal, brought together members of the Functional Ecology editorial board to discuss current issues in global change ecology (these presentations are available online at The nine papers in this special feature—contributions from members of our editorial board that participated in that symposium, plus a few that could not attend the event—have the collective goal of moving us closer to a mechanistic understanding of how ecological patterns and processes are, and will be, affected by global change. Our special feature begins with an exploration of the effects of changing climate on species distributions. Although species distributions have always changed over time due to natural ecological processes, the rate and direction of change observed today in response to climate change is unprecedented (Chen, Hill, Ohlemüller, Roy, & Thomas, 2011). Diamond (2018) starts off our special feature by exploring the extent to which evolutionary history (phylogeny) predicts range shifts in response to climate change, and what this phylogenetic signal can teach us about how and why species ranges expand or contract. Of course, traits that influence an organism's ability to tolerate environmental conditions at the edges of their range are not static—they can be phenotypically plastic within generations and evolve across generations. Diamond thus explores the influences of phenotypic plasticity in stress tolerance on range shifts, focusing on thermal tolerance, a variable that has been demonstrated to explain variation in the distributions of many species. She finds that species with low plasticity in thermal tolerance exhibit much greater shifts in their ranges with climate change (at the leading edge of their expansion), suggesting that the range edges for these species largely track local climates. In contrast, species that are more plastic in thermal tolerance were less likely to experience a range shift in response to climate change, suggesting that their range limits were determined by other environmental variables. One specific category of species ranges that has fascinated ecologists for generations is that of tree lines, the latitudinal and altitudinal boundaries beyond which trees are unable to survive. Because mean soil temperatures are commonly predictive of tree line locations, global warming is expected to cause tree line shifts. Although tree lines do often shift as predicted, there are many cases in which tree lines do not shift as predicted, suggesting that other variables mediate seedling establishment and limit tree line shifts (Harsch, Hulme, McGlone, & Duncan, 2009). In this issue, Lett and Dorrepaal (2018) review our understanding of how environmental factors influence alpine and arctic tree lines, and perform a meta-analysis exploring the relative influences of temperature, water availability, nutrients, light and surrounding vegetation (among other variables) on tree seedling establishment at the tree line. They find that temperature can limit seed germination and seedling growth, but such effects vary widely across species and stages of development. Other environmental factors likewise had variable effects across species, with interactions common. Together, the studies reviewed by Lett and Dorrepaal (2018) demonstrate that temperature, although an important contributor to seedling establishment at tree lines, is just one of many important variables influencing tree line location. Changes in species distributions, either through natural range expansions or introductions to new areas (species invasions), influence the composition of communities, interactions among species and patterns of biodiversity. We lead off our reviews exploring the community-level biodiversity consequences of global change with a paper by Paine, Deasey, and Duthie (2018) that discusses techniques for predicting changes in community dynamics over time frames during which anthropogenic changes likely influence most communities. Paine et al. (2018) review how modern coexistence theory based on the estimation of demographic parameters can be used to predict community dynamics. They suggest that considering ""hard"" functional traits (those most predictive of vital rates) and physiological tolerances can improve predictions of community dynamics in a wide variety of ecosystems. We continue exploring how global change influences biodiversity within communities with two studies that consider interactions between plants and their herbivores. First, Pellissier et al. (2018) consider how herbivory helps maintain plant functional diversity in the face of climate change affecting alpine plant communities. Combining a mathematical model with a case study comparing populations along an elevational gradient in the Swiss Alps, they suggest that trade-offs between traits—those that mediate resistance to herbivory, responses to temperature and competition among species—will facilitate species coexistence and maintain high functional diversity in alpine communities as the climate changes. In the next paper, Koricheva and Hayes (2018) flip the direction of causality and explore how diversity in plant communities affects arthropod diversity at higher trophic levels. Rather than examining species diversity, they examine genetic variation within plant species. Loss of genetic variation within populations is common following human disturbance, such as when populations are fragmented or reduced in size. Genetic diversity can be especially impoverished in human-managed communities, for example, when communities are monocultures, such as in agricultural and urban settings. Yet only recently has genetic diversity within populations been recognized to affect ecological dynamics (e.g. Bailey et al., 2009). Koricheva and Hayes explore how such declines in genetic diversity within plant species can influence biodiversity in arthropods, focusing on herbivores and their natural enemies. They find that within-species genetic diversity can indeed influence biodiversity at higher trophic levels—higher plant genetic diversity begets higher arthropod richness and abundance—with effects of genetic diversity being of similar magnitude to effects of species diversity for some diversity metrics (e.g. arthropod species richness). Food webs are, of course, much more complicated than just herbivores eating plants. They are complex networks of interactions among organisms. Thus, any environmental perturbation that impacts individual species, or interactions among species, can have effects that cascade throughout the community. In her contribution, El-Sabaawi (2018) examines the effects of one particularly large set of perturbations caused by humans—urbanization. Urbanization changes climate (such as temperature, water and light availability), habitat structure (by increasing fragmentation), species composition and the presence of environmental contaminants, all of which can affect individual species, ecological interactions and food web structure (Hahs & Evans, 2015). El-Sabaawi finds that food webs are fundamentally changed by urbanization, with specialists and apex predators generally performing poorly and omnivores (species with flexible diets) often flourishing. But her review also highlights many exceptions to these general patterns, and thus a need for community-level studies that go beyond examining single species, simple interactions or describing food web topology in urban habitats. While urbanization can dramatically alter large regions of the planet over short time periods, few events can alter a landscape as rapidly as wildfire. Having spent many of my formative years as a scientist in the western United States where fires are an annual occurrence, and having witnessed a large-scale wildfire that required evacuation of my research laboratory, I have first-hand appreciation for the speed and extent to which fires alter communities. Wildfires have always occurred naturally, but global climate change and habitat alteration have increased the frequency, size and severity of fires. Davis, Higuera, and Sala (2018) tackle the question of how our changing climate will influence postfire vegetation dynamics, which in turn influences future fire activity. They provide an overview of the demographic filters that influence how forests will respond to changes in climate and wildfires, using western North American forests for illustration. Their model identifies the types of species that should be winners or losers as fire frequency and severity increase, making clear predictions for how communities impacted by fire will change over time. Our final two papers turn to the topic of how alterations in the availability of two essential resources, water and nitrogen, affect community composition and ecosystem function. Griffin-Nolan et al. (2018) use a response–effect trait framework to identify potential explanations for the observed (poor) relationships between plant traits and water availability. They conclude that commonly measured plant traits that predict plant growth and NPP dynamics are not suitable for predicting species responses to changing water availability; instead, traits that more directly relate to hydraulic transport and water-use efficiency are more promising for predicting community and ecosystem responses to changes in water availability. Human activities have elevated nitrogen deposition globally, with the effects greatest in areas with the largest human population densities. Our special feature concludes with Stevens, David, and Storkey (2018) exploring how N deposition affects communities, both at the primary producer level and at less-well understood higher trophic levels. Similar to the conclusions of El-Sabaawi for the effects of urbanization discussed above, Stevens and colleagues predict that species using a more limited range of food sources will be more greatly impacted by N deposition. Negative effects of nitrogen on these species can be caused by changes in resource quality, abundance and phenology. However, they note that clear gaps in the literature limit our ability to predict responses of many taxa, notably large herbivores and pollinators, despite the respective conservation and agricultural significance of those groups. Understanding the mechanisms underlying organism, community and ecosystem responses to global change is one of the most pressing problems, and fastest growing areas, in modern ecology. It is clearly impossible in just nine manuscripts to capture the wide diversity of important environmental changes and ecological interactions influenced by human activities. But I hope these nine manuscripts highlight some of the advances being made, and types of problems being addressed, by studies that take mechanistic approaches to understanding global change ecology. Enabling a mechanistic understanding of ecological pattern and process has defined the scope of Functional Ecology for its first 30 years as a scientific journal and will continue to do so in the Anthropocene. My hope, as a scientist honoured to edit Functional Ecology, is that exciting new research developments, and syntheses of important problems in global change ecology, will continue to populate the pages of this journal in the future. For it is only through understanding that we can hope to solve the problems facing our planet today and tomorrow.

https://doi.org/10.1093/ismeco/ycae148,Distinct phytoplankton size classes respond differently to biotic and abiotic factors,"Abstract The interplay between abiotic (resource supply, temperature) and biotic (grazing) factors determines growth and loss processes in phytoplankton through resource competition and trophic interactions, which are mediated by morphological traits like size. Here, we study the relative importance of grazers, water physics, and chemistry on the daily net accumulation rates (ARs) of individual phytoplankton from natural communities, grouped into six size classes from circa 10 to 500 μm. Using a Random Forest modelling approach and 4 years of daily data from a lake, we find that water temperature is generally a pivotal control of all phytoplankton ARs. At the same time, nutrients and light are important for the smallest and the largest classes. Mesozooplankton abundance is a key predictor of the AR for small phytoplankton, with microzooplankton being important for the middle-size range. In our data, large and small phytoplankton have different (seasonal) blooming patterns: small forms are favoured by low temperature and grazing, and high phosphorus levels. Larger forms show positive ARs at high temperatures and low phosphorus (being relatively insensitive to zooplankton grazing). These results help us understand the opportunities and limitations of using size to explain and model phytoplankton responses to biotic and abiotic environmental change.",W4407269118,True,0.9684449434280396

Here, we review the studies performed in Argentina in which ants were used as model organisms, in the context of ecological theories, hypotheses and concepts. Specifically, we focus on ant studies performed under the conceptual frameworks of ecological engineering, indirect interactions, seed dispersal, community assembly rules, biological invasions and integrated pest management. Those studies contributed to 1) supporting the concept of ecological engineers through the study of the physical changes in the environment caused by ants through the building and maintenance of their nests, and their consequences on other organisms such as soil biota, plants and herbivores; 2) questioning the convergence hypothesis, which proposes that independently assembled communities in similar, but geographically distant habitats converge in composition and functioning under similar environmental pressures; 3) showing that directed seed dispersal is an important process to increase plant performance in desert ecosystems; 4) understanding the type of control which prevails in communities (top-down or bottom-up); 5) emphasizing the relevance of indirect interactions in the structure and functioning of ecosystems with examples of trophic cascades, indirect facilitation, exploitative competition and trait-mediated effects; 6) a better understanding of the causes of success or failure of biological invasions, via the study of the behavioral and demographic characteristics of invasive ant species in their native area, and the role of biotic resistance and mutualism facilitation; and 7) exploring the concept of integrated pest management via the study of the use of natural enemies, repellents and attractants, and the knowledge about the feeding and foraging behavior of pests.

We studied Neotyphodium occultans effects on soil nematode communities mediated by current and past patch occupancy by endophyteinfected Lolium multiflorum populations. A microcosm experiment was performed to evaluate whether abundance and diversity of nematodes at different trophic levels were affected by endophyte infection through rhizosphere-mediated or littermediated effects. We found that presence of endophyte-infected plants and their aerial litter both triggered a bottom-up trophic cascade enhancing the abundance of herbivorous and predaceous nematode taxa. Endophyte infection also increased overall nematode richness, mostly through changes induced at the highest trophic level in this soil food web. Our results suggest that fungal endophytes can modify the linkages between aboveand belowground community compartments, with potential consequences on plant patch dynamics.

https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1461-9563.2001.00083.x,"Out of sight, out of mind: the impacts of root‐feeding insects in natural and managed systems","Data from diverse ecosystems indicate that more than 50% of net primary production is commonly allocated to below-ground plant parts (Coleman, 1976), and values for particular plant species approach 90% (Andersen, 1987). Root biomass can typically vary from under 300 g/m2 to over 4000 g/m2 of soil surface (Rickleffs, 1973) and, however, you look at it, that's a lot of biomass. Although the nutritional value of root tissue is generally lower than that of foliar tissue, we shouldn't be surprised that many species of herbivore, including insects, exploit the roots of plants. What is surprising, however, is the extreme paucity of information on the distribution, abundance and effects of root-feeding insects on plants in natural and managed systems. If we as entomologists were to use our peer-reviewed literature as an indication of the relative allocation by plants to foliage and roots, we would get a shockingly biased picture. Over the last 5 years, for example, Ecological Entomology (5 years) and Agricultural and Forest Entomology (1 year) have published a combined four articles on root-feeding insects in comparison to 288 articles on insects that feed on above-ground plant parts. With this apparent bias in effort, it's little wonder that even basic information on the distribution and abundance of root-feeding insects is missing for most ecosystems (Morón-Ríos et al. 1997). Yet below-ground insect herbivores are known to influence the diversity of plant communities, the rate and direction of succession, competitive interactions among plants, their allocation to different functions, the susceptibility of plants to other herbivores and pathogens and, ultimately, the yield of agricultural and forest systems (below). This paper considers what we do know about the effects of root-feeding insects on plants, and where our major knowledge gaps remain. Its intent is to stimulate discussion and an increase in research efforts on the ecology and management of below-ground insect herbivores. For purposes of brevity, 'root-feeding' is used here as shorthand for consumption of all below-ground tissues, including roots, rhizomes and other storage organs. Removal of root tissue by insect herbivores can result in a diversity of responses in their host plants, varying from changes in root : shoot ratios, through changes in subsequent carbon and nitrogen allocation, to death of the plants. Of course, the effects of root herbivory on plants are not restricted to loss of root tissue. In mixed-grass prairie, for example, root-feeding can reduce annual net primary productivity by 16 times more than is actually consumed (Ingham & Detling, 1990). In both agricultural (Latin & Reed, 1985) and forest (Klepzig et al. 1996) systems, root-feeding insects can introduce plant pathogens that affect survival and yield. There is no clear consensus as to whether loss of biomass from root or shoot tissue has the greatest deleterious effects on plant performance but, in at least one study, removal of root tissue had a greater effect on plant performance than did removal of shoot tissue (Reichman & Smith, 1991). Root herbivores may cause losses in protein from the tap root, a reduction in non-structural carbohydrate root reserves and, subsequently, plant mortality (Godfrey et al. 1987; Dintenfass & Brown, 1988a,1b). However, plants infested by root-feeding insects may also exhibit increases in root nitrogen content and a concomitant reduction in foliar N content, reflecting a redirection of nitrogen to the stronger sink (Steinger & Müller-Schärer, 1992). It would seem important that future studies direct attention to whether differences in experimental results (i.e. increases or decreases in root nitrogen content) reflect differences in the plants under study, the identity of the root herbivores, or other ecological variables. This is the kind of basic information that is still lacking. It seems likely, however, that lumping all root-feeding insects together into a single functional group and expecting them to have similar effects on their host plants may be a considerable oversimplification. In the same way that plants respond differentially to attack by different species or guilds of insect herbivores above ground (Hunter, 2000a) so we should expect differential effects of below-ground herbivores on plant performance. This was aptly demonstrated by Steinger & Müller-Schärer, (1992), who found that root-feeding by the moth Agapeta zoegana on Centaurea maculosa seedlings had no effect on shoot or root mass. By contrast, feeding by the weevil Cyphocleomus achates on the same plant greatly reduced shoot biomass. At least some plants can tolerate significant levels of root herbivory, even under water stress (Dunn & Frommelt, 1998), with compensatory growth replacing root biomass (Schmid et al. 1990). In legumes, there can be compensation for nodule damage by insect herbivores (Quinn & Hall, 1992), although the compensatory mechanisms may be insufficient to prevent reductions in the nitrogen concentrations of tissue. In the legume Medicago sativa, compensatory responses are strong and denodulated plants recover nodule number and nodule biomass within 15 and 22 days, respectively (Quinn & Hall, 1996). Indeed, many plants appear to be adept at re-growing lost root tissue and, as a side note, this may lead us to underestimate the impacts of below-ground herbivores. However, compensation for root loss is not without cost and compensatory root growth in response to below-ground herbivory may often occur at the expense of above-ground net primary production (Andersen, 1987). Losses in above-ground biomass appear to be a common response to root damage by insects. For example, root herbivory on white clover by Sitona flavescens reduces foliar biomass, total nitrogen and carbon contents, and impairs nitrogen fixation (Murray et al. 1996). Likewise, feeding by Cerotoma arcuata larvae on bean roots and nodules reduces plant growth and subsequent yield (Teixeira et al. 1996). As Goldson et al. (1988) point out, compensation is associated with increased respiration rates and depleted carbohydrate reserves within the plant as assimilates from shoot reserves are diverted to satisfy the increased demands of the root system. Moreover, even when vegetative recovery seems to be high, compensation for root damage does not necessarily mean that subsequent reproductive output, competitive ability and nutrient or water uptake will be as high as those of undamaged plants (Detling et al. 1980). At least some of the deleterious effects on plants of root damage are likely to be expressed indirectly through interactions with other organisms and the environment (see below). Given that compensatory root growth may lead us to underestimate the densities and activities of root-feeding insects, we may be most likely to recognize their effects post mortem. For example, root-feeding insects are associated with pine seedling mortality in the south-eastern United States (Mitchell et al. 1991) and Eucalyptus seedling mortality in plantations in India (Nair & Varma, 1985). In a spectacular example, ghost moth caterpillars can cause up to 41% mortality in bush lupine stands in California (Strong et al. 1995) and appear to contribute to the long-term dynamics of lupine populations. However, entomopathogenic nematodes can greatly reduce populations of ghost moth caterpillars and the ultimate effect of root-feeding on bush lupine populations probably reflects complex interactions among many ecological players (Strong et al. 1996, 1999). Interestingly, the fecundity of bush lupines can take 3 years to respond to suppression of below-ground herbivory (Maron, 1998), suggesting that short-term experiments may again underestimate the impact of root-feeding insects on plant populations. Unless root-feeding insects cause substantial crop mortality, or directly attack plant parts that are harvested for economic gain, their impacts on financial yield can be difficult to assess. Nonetheless, some root-feeding insects have been shown to have dramatic effects upon production systems. During the 1990s, black pine weevil, Otiorhynchus sulcatus, progressively became the most serious pest in European ornamental nursery stock and soft fruit production (Labuschagne, 1999). Larvae feed on both roots and crown and the devastating nature of the pest means that the threshold for control may be very low. Its pest status is exacerbated by life-history traits that include a wide range of alternative hosts (weeds and non-crop plants) and a fecundity of between 500 and 1200 eggs per female per season. Like many root-feeding pests, O. sulcatus is difficult to detect during the early stages of outbreak and its densities are hard to monitor. They are also difficult to detect before or during the transportation of soil or nursery stock. Nodule-feeding insects that attack nitrogen-fixing legumes can also be serious pests. Although well-recognized as pests of pulse crops such as peas and beans (O'Keefe et al. 1984), they can also cause economic problems in other production systems. For example, low input grassland systems managed for grazing usually require nitrogen-fixing legumes such as clover (Murray & Clements, 1999) that are useful both as a nitrogen source for the soil and as forage for livestock. Many agricultural soils are also enriched by the planting of legumes as 'green manure' (P. F. Hendrix, personal communication). Weevils in the genus Sitona seem to be particularly important pests in such systems as a consequence of nodule feeding by young larvae and root-feeding by older larvae. In fact, Sitona lineatus, distributed throughout Europe and in the western United States, is responsible for serious losses in yield to both edible legumes and forage legumes (Jackson, 1920; Oschmann, 1984). Again, estimates of yield losses may often be underestimated because of the difficulties associated with measuring damage by larvae. In addition to such well-known pests as corn rootworm and cabbage root fly, root-feeding insects influence many other production systems. These include the turf grass industry, where both yield and aesthetic quality affect economic value (Crutchfield & Potter, 1995), and apple, orchards where root-feeding aphids can reduce tree growth and the number and weight of fruit per tree (Brown et al. 1995). Given the ability of some below-ground herbivores to depress plant growth and reproduction, it is not surprising that they are often evaluated as potential biological control agents of weed pests (Müller-Schärer, 1991; Blossey, 1993; Sheppard et al. 1995; Harris & Clapperton, 1997; Schwarzlaender, 1997). In a well-studied example, control of Senecio jacobaea in California has been maintained over the long-term by the combined activities of a defoliating moth and a root-feeding flea beetle (Pemberton & Turner, 1990). Control of root-feeding insects in production systems is hampered, in part, by the difficulties of detection and access. Simply put, it is difficult to know when intervention is required and even more difficult to target a substantial proportion of the pest population with the chosen method of control. Some measure of success against the black pine weevil has been achieved using glue-coated barriers and trap cropping with favoured plant species (Labuschagne, 1999). Biological control of this and other root pests using entomopathogenic nematodes may provide the most promise (Kakouli et al. 1997), given that they may be specific to the pest and can be applied through a variety of measures including irrigation systems. Entomopathogenic nematodes also appear to be important mortality agents in some natural systems (Strong et al. 1996, 1999), suggesting that their life-histories are well-suited for exploitation as agents of control. The jury is still out on the effectiveness of general predators as biological control agents of root-feeding insects. Carabid ground beetles would appear to have significant potential as control agents, but their reported impact on pests such as the cabbage root fly (Hughes, 1959; Coaker & Williams, 1963) may have been overestimated (Finch & Elliot, 1999). Recent studies have indicated that the efficacy of beetle predators is directly related to the relative size of beetle and prey (Finch, 1996), which may aid in the selection of potential control agents. As studies by Finch & Elliott, (1999) make clear, beetle predators are much more effective when the life stages of the pest are directly accessible on the soil surface, and even thin layers of soil covering the prey items can prevent the successful suppression of prey populations. Of course, selection of appropriate generalist predators for biological control is predicated upon knowing what they consume and in what proportion. Prey-specific monoclonal antibodies appear to have considerable potential as indicators of diet breadth in generalists such as carabids (Harwood et al. 1999; Symondson & Glen, 1999). Once again, however, we are limited by a basic lack of knowledge of both pest and predator ecology. Chemical control of root-feeding insects has been the most common intervention strategy. However, there are concerns with the safety of commonly used products such as Chlorpyrifos (Dursban), which provides only a few weeks of control in its standard formulation. The extended release formulation of Chlorpyrifos (suScon Green) lasts longer in the environment, but is more expensive and less likely to come into contact with individual root pests. Both formulations can kill natural enemies and other soil fauna. Given that Bt-transgenic corn can release biologically active Bt into the rhizosphere in root exudates (Saxena et al. 1999), there exists the potential to develop transgenic crops modified specifically to defend themselves against root-feeding insects. Of course, the continuing controversy surrounding the development and use of genetically modified crops (Hunter, 2000b) may limit the exploitation of transgenic plants for use against root-feeding insects. Such crops would, however, solve the problem of access by ensuring contact between pest populations and the mechanism of control. Cultural control methods also have potential to reduce economic losses imposed by below-ground insect herbivores (Potter et al. 1996). For example, seasonal draining of rice fields can reduce oviposition by rice water weevil (Hesler et al. 1992). Likewise, traditional plant breeding programmes may be able to select for crops that are either tolerant or resistant to damage by root-feeding insects. In one of the few studies to address the issue, Houle & Simard 1996) found that compensatory responses (tolerance) of willow plants to simulated root herbivory did not vary among willow genotypes. The apparent lack of genetic variation in tolerance to root herbivory requires further investigation, given that genetic variation for resistance has been observed in several other systems (Powell et al. 1983; Byers et al. 1996; Strong et al. 1996). Indeed, the entire issue of genetically based resistance and tolerance to below-ground herbivores requires much more exploration in combination with mechanistic studies of root defence. One of the most striking gaps in our understanding of below-ground herbivory is the degree to which below-ground structures (roots, rhizomes, etc.) gain protection from herbivory through chemical defence. There is little doubt that some below-ground plant organs contain high concentrations of toxins (e.g. the potent alkaloids in the rhizomes of bloodroot, Sanguinaria canadensis). However, the standard bioassays and measurements of insect performance, so prevalent in studies of above-ground insect herbivory, are generally lacking in below-ground systems. For example, although the presence of phenylpropanoid-derived metabolites in some plant roots is well established (Graham, 1991), their effects on insect herbivores have received little attention. Likewise, fine roots of forest trees often contain astringent phenolics and their concentrations generally increase as soil fertility declines (Muller et al. 1989). However, the degree to which astringent phenolics deter root-feeding insects is presently unclear. Studies of defence induction in roots are also in their infancy. Although both synthesis and concentrations of some plant defences are known to be high in roots (Baldwin, 1989; Tallamy & McCloud, 1991), comparatively little work has examined the effects of induced defences in roots on root-feeding insects. The few studies to date suggest that, as in above-ground tissues, defence induction in roots may be a common phenomenon. Grape (Vitis vinifera) roots can respond to attack by Phylloxera vastatrix aphids by producing a local necrotic zone around each aphid that isolates attackers from healthy tissue (Karban & Baldwin, 1997). Roots of wild parsnip, Pastinaca sativa, respond to damage by increases in their concentrations of furanocoumarins (Zangerl & Rutledge, 1996). In a compelling example, damage to spinach roots induces phytoecdysteroids (analogues of insect moulting hormones), whereas infection by fungal pathogens does not (Schmelz et al. 1998, 1999). Given that foliar concentrations of phytoecdysteroids are unaffected by root damage, this provides evidence of an evolved defence in spinach roots directed at below-ground insect herbivores. However, the effects of insect herbivores on the induction of defences in roots may be complex. For example, damage by turnip root fly, Delia floralis, causes a linear increase in only one of 14 glucosinolates in swede roots. An apparent balance between increases in aromatic glucosinolates and decreases in aliphatic glucosinolates results in overall glucosinolate concentration being unaffected by root damage (Hopkins et al. 1998). There are, of course, methodological difficulties associated with assessing putative chemical defences and their effects on insect herbivores below ground. In vitro root culture techniques may prove useful in future studies of root defence against herbivores (Wu et al. 1999). It would be naïve to expect that interactions between root-feeding insects and their host plants occur in isolation from other species in the community or are unaffected by interactions with the abiotic environment. Below-ground insect herbivores are members of complex food webs and participate in both community-level and ecosystem-level processes. Consequently, both biotic and abiotic forces interact with below-ground herbivory to dictate plant performance (Godfrey & Yeargan, 1985). For example, the effects of root-feeding on Vicia establishment vary with both soil fertility and levels of mycorrhizal infection (Ganade & Brown, 1997). Likewise, compensation by Centaurea maculosa for weevil herbivory on its roots is greatly compromised by nutrient deficiency (Steinger & Müller-Schärer (1992). In a fascinating multi-trophic interaction, fungal endophytes (Acremonium spp.) associated with fescue grasses increase the susceptibility of root-feeding Japanese beetle larvae to the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (Grewal et al. 1995). Competition among plants can overwhelm the effect of root herbivory in some systems (Müller-Schärer, 1991), but not in others (Noetzold et al. 1997). It seems likely then that interactions among root feeding and other ecological factors will prove to be complex and context-dependent in many systems. Studies by Val Brown and colleagues have been instrumental in highlighting the effects of below-ground herbivores on plant diversity. At the community level, insect herbivory below ground can reduce plant species richness and alter patterns of succession in European old fields (Brown & Gange, 1989). Specifically, root-feeding insects can accelerate succession by reducing forb persistence and colonization (Brown & Gange, 1992) with the application of soil insecticide increasing plant species richness, vegetative cover and plant size (Masters & Brown, 1997). In short-grass prairie, even infrequent outbreaks of insect herbivores below ground can have long-term effects on plant community dynamics and recovery from disturbance (Coffin et al. 1998). Of course, the effects of below-ground herbivory on plant biomass and species diversity can vary both seasonally and with the plant species under investigation (Wardle & Barker, 1997). At the ecosystem level, low levels of below-ground herbivory can increase nitrogen flux from plants to soil, increase soil microbial activity, and increase the rates of nitrogen recycling in grassland ecosystems (Bardgett et al. 1999). In tallgrass prairie, the emergence of annual cicadas can represent a significant flux of non-gaseous nitrogen from below-to above-ground (Callaham et al. 2000). Mycorrhizae, as a result of their intimate associations with root systems, may influence feeding by below-ground herbivores by changing the quality or the quantity of root resources (Gange, 1999). If studies of root–insect herbivore interactions are relatively rare, those that consider mycorrhizae are positively endangered! The data that do exist suggest that colonization of plant roots by arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) has a negative impact on root-feeding insects. For example, Gange et al. (1994) demonstrated that the survival and biomass of black pine weevil larvae feeding on the roots of Taraxacum officinale were halved by the presence of the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae. When Gange (1996) repeated the experiment using strawberry as a host-plant, root colonization by a single species of AM again reduced the performance of weevil larvae. However, when roots were colonized by two AM species simultaneously, the negative effects on the root-feeding insect disappeared. Extrapolating from a single study is dangerous, but it suggests that any resistance factor(s) conferred on roots by their association with mycorrhizae may be compromised if multiple infection takes place. Given that mycorrhizal colonization generally increases the biomass of roots (Smith & Read, 1997), their putative effects upon root resistance to herbivores is more likely to be mediated by changes in root quality than root quantity (Gange, 1999). As studies of below-ground herbivory become more common, complex interactions among community members both above- and below-ground are likely to emerge. For example, foliage removal by a leaf-chewing insects can result in reduced mycorrhizal colonization of plant roots (Gehring & Whitham, 1991; Gange & Bower, 1997). Given that mycorrhizal colonization can confer resistance to root feeders (Gange et al. 1994; Gange, 1996), above-ground defoliation has the potential to increase the susceptibility of roots to their herbivores. However, most studies seem to suggest that the opposite is true; stem- and leaf-feeding insects appear to reduce the performance of root-feeding insects. For example, Moran & Whitham, (1990) demonstrated that leaf galling by aphids on Chenopodium can lead to a large reduction in the populations of root-feeding aphids. Conversely, below-ground damage by insect herbivores is generally thought to increase the quality of plant tissues for above-ground herbivores (Gange & Brown, 1989; Masters et al. 1993). These complex interactions between below- and above-ground herbivores are potentially very important. When we observe high densities of insect herbivores feeding upon the leaves and shoots of our agricultural and timber crops, we rarely consider the possibility that the severity of their depredations may result, in part, from high densities of root-feeding insects. Likewise, yield increases following the successful control of above-ground insect pests may be compromised by subsequent increases in the densities of root-feeding herbivores. It may be early to speak of generalities when so few data are available, but the current consensus appears to be that the patterns described by Moran & Whitham, (1990) and Gange & Brown, (1989) may be common; above-ground herbivory has a negative effect on root-feeders, whereas below-ground herbivory has a positive effect on foliar feeders (Masters et al. 1993; Masters, 1999). The evidence for such contramensal interactions (Arthur & Mitchell, 1989) comes from both laboratory and field studies. For example, root-feeding aphid populations on Cardamine are significantly reduced in the presence of shoot-feeding aphids (Salt et al. 1996). Similarly, the growth rates of chafer larvae feeding upon the roots of Sonchus oleraceus are reduced when leaves are concurrently mined by Agromyzid larvae (Masters & Brown, 1992). By contrast, the pupal weights of leaf miners are higher in the presence of chafers. Other guilds of above-ground herbivores (leaf-chewers, phloem-feeders) also respond positively to chafer damage in this system (Masters, 1999) while simultaneously depressing chafer growth rates. Field experiments employing soil insecticides (Masters, 1995b; Masters & Brown, 1997) and artificial root damage (Foggo & Speight, 1993; Foggo et al. 1994) support the view that below-ground herbivores facilitate population growth of insect herbivores above ground. Interactions between above- and below-ground herbivores appear to be mediated primarily by increases in soluble nitrogen and sugar contents in above-ground tissues (root-feeders increase foliage quality) and decreases in root biomass below-ground (aerial herbivores depress root growth) (Holland & Detling, 1990; Masters, 1995a). More detailed investigations of mechanism are, however, desperately needed in such systems, including the potential induction or suppression of defences (Seastedt et al. 1988; Karban & Baldwin, 1997) and the signalling pathways responsible for both defensive and 'civilian' plant responses to damage (Hunter, 2000a). Such investigations may help to explain why some studies do not conform to established patterns. For example, above-ground grazing by vertebrates can increase the densities of root-feeding insects (Roberts & Morton, 1985; Seastedt et al. 1988), and artificial defoliation of bunchgrass, Muhlenbergia quadridentata, has no effect on root-feeding Phyllophaga larvae in Mexico (Morón-Ríos et al. 1997). Given the importance of damage-specific signal cascades to the defensive response of plants (Hunter, 2000a), we should not be surprised that vertebrate grazing, artificial damage and foliar-feeding insects generate different responses by plants and their below-ground herbivores. In terms of relative biomass and productivity, below-ground plant parts represent a substantial fraction of the resources available to terrestrial herbivores. In terms of relative effort by insect ecologists, root-feeding insects have been greatly understudied. There are several areas of endeavour that would appear to require considerable work. First, we need detailed mechanistic studies of root defences. How variable are the physical and chemical defences of roots? Do they have a significant impact upon the populations of root-feeding insects? What signalling pathways are expressed during the induction of root defences and how are they affected by environmental variables? Second, we need to explore genetic variation in the tolerance and resistance of plant roots to their insect herbivores. An understanding of that genetic variation, and the role of the environment in its expression, will allow us to better comprehend the evolution of root defences and the potential to select for resistant and tolerant crop varieties. Third, we should explore the potential of genetically modified crops with tissue-specific root defences against root-feeding insects. Problems of applying control measures below ground may make transgenic plants a suitable option for reducing the depredations of below-ground crop pests. Of course, a detailed understanding of rhizosphere ecology and impacts on non-target organisms will also be required. Fourth, increased exploitation of entomopathogenic nematodes as control agents of root-feeding insects should be explored. They appear to have dramatic impacts in both natural and managed systems and are of great potential benefit to biological control programmes. Finally, studies of root herbivore–mycorrhizal interactions are considerably improving our understanding of soil ecology and their number should be greatly increased. Insect ecologists are not generally reluctant to get their hands dirty, and the paucity of studies of below-ground herbivores may reflect methodological difficulties rather than lack of interest. It might be time for the funding agencies to develop financial incentives to encourage researchers to solve methodological limitations and to redress the imbalance that currently favours research on insects above ground. In any case, we have clearly had our heads in the sand on the issue of root-feeding insects. Unfortunately, most of us appear to have had our eyes shut at the time. I would like to thank the US Department of Agriculture (Grant 00-35101-9283) for supporting our work on root herbivores.",W1971573803,True,0.9659010171890259
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4950,Competition between mixo‐ and heterotrophic ciliates under dynamic resource supply,"Abstract The outcome of species competition strongly depends on the traits of the competitors and associated trade‐offs, as well as on environmental variability. Here, we investigate the relevance of consumer trait variation for species coexistence in a ciliate consumer–microalgal prey system under fluctuating regimes of resource supply. We focus on consumer competition and feeding traits, and specifically on the consumer's ability to overcome periods of resource limitation by mixotrophy, that is, the ability of photosynthetic carbon fixation via algal symbionts in addition to phagotrophy. In a 48‐day chemostat experiment, we investigated competitive interactions of different heterotrophic and mixotrophic ciliates of the genera Euplotes and Coleps under different resource regimes, providing prey either continuously or in pulses under constant or fluctuating light, entailing periods of resource depletion in fluctuating environments, but overall providing the same amount of prey and light. Although ultimate competition results remained unaffected, population dynamics of mixotrophic and heterotrophic ciliates were significantly altered by resource supply mode. However, the effects differed among species combinations and changed over time. Whether mixotrophs or heterotrophs dominated in competition strongly depended on the genera of the competing species and thus, species‐specific differences in the minimum resource requirements that are associated with feeding on shared prey, nutrient uptake, light harvesting, and access to additional resources such as bacteria. Potential differences in the curvature of the species' resource‐dependent growth functions may have further mediated the species‐specific responses to the different resource supply modes. Overall, our study demonstrates that genus‐ or species‐specific traits other than that related to nutritional mode may override the relevance of acquired phototrophy by heterotrophs in competitive interactions, and that the potential advantage of photosynthetic carbon fixation of symbiont‐bearing mixotrophs in competition with pure heterotrophs may differ greatly among different mixotrophs, playing out under different environmental conditions and depending on the specific requirements of the species. Complex trophic interactions determine the outcome of competition, which can only be understood by taking on a multidimensional trait perspective.",W4400672496,True,0.9630719423294067
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.14122,Resource supply and organismal dominance are associated with high secondary production in temperate agricultural streams,"Abstract Agricultural land‐use affects the environmental and biological characteristics of stream ecosystems through multiple pathways including nutrient and pesticide contamination, riparian clear‐cutting and hydromorphological degradation. These changes in the abiotic environment can have a direct effect on the productivity of macroinvertebrate communities through environmental filtering and via altered resource conditions encompassing a shift from allochthonous to autochthonous primary production and changes in elemental stoichiometry and food quality. Additionally, macroinvertebrate productivity can be affected indirectly via biological mechanisms, such as changes in species interactions, richness, competition, and predation. We studied the effects of agriculture on structural and functional descriptors of macroinvertebrate communities by assessing environmental characteristics and macroinvertebrate secondary production (MSP), biomass and density in two forested and two agricultural streams and investigated underlying biotic mechanisms. On average, MSP was 1.6–3.6, biomass 2.8–6.2 and density 5–13 times higher in agricultural than in forested streams. This pattern was associated with higher nutrient concentrations, standing crops of riparian herbaceous vegetation, suspended particulate organic carbon, quantity and quality of epilithic biofilms and chlorophyll‐a concentrations in seston and biofilm of the agricultural streams. Species richness and evenness were significantly lower in agricultural than in forested streams. A negative relationship between MSP and species richness and evenness indicated that density compensation and trait dominance were the prevalent mechanisms facilitating higher MSP in agricultural streams. Our findings suggest that the loss of riparian canopy and excess nutrient conditions are the major environmental drivers contributing to homogenization of ecological niches and dominance of highly productive non‐insect generalist species. This study highlights the importance of an ecosystem approach to understanding how complex aggregate stressors affect the regulation of consumer–resource interactions. There is an urgent need to preserve or restore natural riparian vegetation, fostering habitat and resource diversity and limiting nutrient contamination to stream ecosystems.

https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2008.02407.x,Systems biology or the biology of systems: routes to reducing hunger,"Each day passes with 854 million people hungry and, for that reason, the United Nations Millennium Declaration committed the world's nations to ‘eradicate extreme poverty and hunger’. Nonetheless, developed nations are both reducing their investments in agricultural research and turning their remaining research investments away from productivity gains (Pardey et al., 2006). The elite rice cultivars, which dominate the food supplies of the millions of poor people in Asia, have approached a yield barrier (Kropff et al., 1994; Sheehy, 2001; Sheehy et al., 2007a), and the gains made from the Green Revolution technologies (centred on canopy architecture and crop nutrition) have been fully exploited (Dawe, 2007). During the coming century, climate change will probably result in more extreme variations in weather and may cause adverse shifts in the world's existing climatic patterns, further disadvantaging the poor (Agarwal & Narain, 1991). Water scarcity will grow; and the increasing demand for biofuels will result in competition between grain for fuel and grain for food, resulting in price increases (Cassman & Liska, 2007). In the face of the above problems, an increase in rice yields of > 50% will be required by 2050 to keep pace with population growth in Asia (Mitchell & Sheehy, 2006). ‘Modern’ systems biology is loosely associated with the use of genomic technologies to understand specific biological processes, although ecologists and physiologists have been using a systems approach to model crops for many years (Gutierrez et al., 2005). A weakness of genetic engineering approaches (bottom-up) to crop improvement is that changes at the molecular level can be dissipated when scaled up through biochemical and physiological levels to the response of crops in the field (Sinclair et al., 2004). In this article, we address the following two issues: can the top-down approaches of systems modelling identify a broad solution to the problem of increasing yields? can the ‘modern’ concepts of systems biology (bottom-up) identify the details of the solution at the molecular level? Here we describe briefly the factors that must be considered in a systems approach to yield improvement. The phenotype of a given genotype can vary markedly according to its interaction with the environment (Miflin, 2000). Such plasticity in plants is probably associated with their ability to succeed despite changes in weather, climate, competition for resources and soil types. In order to increase yields, plants growing in communities have to convert more solar energy into chemical energy or use the absorbed energy more efficiently in the synthesis of biomass or grain. Even something as simple as the spacing between plants can markedly alter their morphology and functionality. Crop communities are crowded neighborhoods in which leaves and stems compete for light. Full light absorption by a crop canopy is set by the leaf area per unit ground area and its angular distribution; the angular distribution also has consequences for the diurnal pattern of light interception. That pattern determines the maximum amount of radiation absorbed per unit area of a leaf, the time of day when that peak absorption occurs and the photochemical consequences of that pattern. At full light interception, the size of individual leaves is proportional to the tiller or plant number per unit ground area, and specific leaf area is determined by competition for light. Leaf photosynthesis and specific leaf area can be linearly related (Pearce et al., 1969). Heat plays a role in the efficiency with which chemical energy can be accumulated; in part it determines the length of the growing season and the rate at which panicles develop. The same daily quantity of solar energy can be delivered to a crop in both temperate and tropical environments. This is because long days in temperate environments often have less intense solar irradiance than in tropical environments, which have short days. However, the temperatures in those environments are usually very different. The interplay of temperature and irradiance results in growing seasons of different lengths in temperate and tropical environments, although the radiation-use efficiencies are the same. The radiation-use efficiency is the slope of the relationship between cumulative above-ground biomass and cumulative photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the crop. Usually, irrigation ensures that water is not a limiting factor, but rainfall varies in intensity, duration and frequency in the growing season so the availability of water is a complex problem. Fertilizers are applied to ensure maximum yields, but the demand from the crop varies throughout crop development as does the quantity of fertilizer available at any given instant. In rice, more than half of the nitrogen (N) in the grain comes from the vegetative parts of the plant, although halfway through grain filling, N is diverted from grain to ratoon tillers (Sheehy et al., 2004). The availability of resources and their rate of capture have a huge influence on yield. Whenever the issue of yield increases is discussed, at some point the relative importance of source strength vs sink capacity arises. Work by Sheehy et al. (2001) showed that the sink capacity in rice was greatly in excess of that actually utilized, even at high yield, suggesting that the yield barrier was the consequence of source limitations. Experiments in which increased concentrations of CO2 were made available to rice resulted in increased yields (Yoshida, 1973; Ziska et al., 1997), suggesting that improvements in photosynthesis might have a role to play in increasing yield. In well-managed crops, in which the fraction of grain per unit of biomass has been maximized, future yield improvements must be accompanied by increases in radiation-use efficiency. Mitchell et al. (1998) showed that C4 crops had radiation-use efficiencies that were 50% greater than C3 crops and that radiation-use efficiency was a function of photosynthesis. This led to the suggestion that rice photosynthesis would have to be converted from the C3 to the C4 syndrome to achieve yield increases of 50%. Sheehy et al. (2007b) went some way to confirming this conclusion when they reported that rice and maize crops grown without limitations of water or nutrients at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the dry season of 2006 yielded 8.3 tonne ha−1 13.9 tonne ha−1 respectively. Furthermore, although C4 plants display plasticity (Sage & McKown, 2006), their C4 nature is not lost during plastic responses to the environment. The attraction of the full C4 system is not only the high productivity and yield, but also the better use made of water and N. No non-C4 solution offers this complete package of benefits. A system can be defined as a number of interacting elements existing within a boundary that is surrounded by an environment. A system could be a cell, a plant, a crop, an ecosystem or a factory; quantitative descriptions of those systems are called models. Consideration of most problems often leads to a quantitative approach and then calculations to describe what is happening or what might happen given different circumstances. The principal function of systems analysis is to understand and quantify the relationship between the inputs and outputs of materials. The analytical procedures appropriate for systems analysis are often reductionist: they are designed to analyse the individual parts of the system. Once the parts have been described, quantitatively, an integrated description of the system can be produced. In the absence of redundancy, a change to any part of the system affects the performance of the whole. The crop scientist looks at systems biology as the most coherent method of describing and understanding a complex system. The crop modeller quickly recognizes many interacting components, within and between organisms, and the hierarchical nature of the system (for example, genes–transcriptome–biochemistry–cells–organs–plants–crops). Empirical models seek to describe the system as simply as possible, whereas mechanistic models look for understanding and generality. Mechanistic models offer understanding only at one level in the hierarchy, being empirical at lower levels for the sake of making progress at the higher level of prime interest. Mechanistic models of crops tend to be based on empirical descriptions of how organs work in relation to environmental and management variables. A particular difficulty is describing mechanisms controlling assimilate partitioning between organs. Biological systems depend on control mechanisms, although they are often ill understood at a mechanistic level. If there are n interacting elements, there are n(n−1) possible interactions or routes for information exchange. If information literally flows in one direction from one element to another in a simple system containing four elements, twelve channels (actions and reactions) are required to carry the information necessary to coordinate the activities of the elements within the system. Not surprisingly, at a cellular level this rule is likely to result in a very large number of signaling pathways. Building a mechanistic model of a biological system at any scale is no easy feat, and a hypothesis, mathematics and substantial amounts of information are required (Thornley & France, 2007). Perhaps ‘modern’ systems biology is such a young branch of science that the measuring technologies have overwhelmed scientists’ ability to make quantitative models describing the way that cells work at a molecular level. In this context it is important to note that crop modelling often involves building caricatures of systems with the most important and critical features included and the fine details ignored. Crop models are often quasi-mechanistic, using factors such as radiation-use efficiency as if they were universal constants that summarize the physiological behaviour of a crop (Mitchell et al., 1998). Common to both crop systems and ‘modern’ systems approaches is the possibility that emergent properties will be found (i.e. aspects of the behaviour of the system that could not be predicted from knowledge of the individual components). Owing to the complexity inherent in both approaches, marrying them in a single coherent model of crop yield remains a distant prospect. However, that does not preclude a working and profitable partnership between the top-down and bottom-up approaches. It would seem as if the goal for plant systems biology is to describe the functioning of cells, tissues and the entire plant through molecular analysis and mathematical modelling of physical and chemical interactions between components of living plants and cells. It is an ambitious goal that will take considerable time to realize. Nonetheless, Nelson et al. (2007) suggested that a systems approach is designed to be broad and unbiased, to permit the discovery of ‘emergent’ properties that might not be revealed in hypothesis-driven experimentation that is targeted at specific genes, proteins, activities, or metabolites. By evaluating all components of the system when it is perturbed, computational approaches are able to infer networks of relationships that can then be tested. With the rice genome completely sequenced and with constantly improving annotation, Nelson et al. (2007) suggests that it now makes sense to build ‘-omics’ data sets from developing cells that will permit this computational approach to discovery. New techniques such as laser microdissection of cell types and microarray profiling may provide the comprehensive data needed for such a systems approach. Despite the current optimism, it is not yet possible to know whether ‘modern’ systems biology will play a significant role in solving global food problems in the next few decades. Nonetheless, the work of Nelson et al. (2007) is an extremely exciting approach to understanding the control of leaf development at the molecular level. The techniques of genetic engineering enable genes from sexually incompatible species to be used to create transgenic crops. This development has led to progress in hypothesis-driven plant improvements. Thus far, success has generally come from inserting a single gene for increasing the tolerance to environmental pressures such as submersion, resistance to pests and diseases, as well as tolerance to herbicides. However, attempts have been made to engineer novel multigene pathways to increase photosynthesis in leaves (Suzuki et al., 2006) and to recapture CO2 from photorespiration (Kebeish et al., 2007). Thus, whole suites of genes encoding desirable traits governing yield can be introduced using the same technology. Of course, the traits have to be identified and understood. Biological N fixation is such a trait, but the genetics of the symbiosis are not yet fully understood (Ladha & Reddy, 2000). To guarantee success in genetic engineering, it is important to know how the trait functions at a physiological level in individual plants and in the communities of plants that form crops. Then the genes responsible for the traits have to be identified, which often involves the generation and screening of large numbers of mutants. Given the rate of progress in sequencing technologies (Service, 2006), candidate regions in the genome will be identified by sequencing the wild type and the mutant. Then, by using bioinformatics tools to compare those sequences, the specific genes of interest can eventually be identified. To create a successful transgenic using a multigene trait, an increased understanding of the regulatory networks that control the tissue-specific expression of genes will probably be needed (Gowik & Westhoff, 2007). How does a program of genetic engineering ensure that an introduced trait is not obscured during the plastic responses displayed when the plants are grown as a crop community? It is not infrequent to read that the expression or overexpression of a particular gene inserted in rice will increase yield by a large percentage (Xiao et al., 1998; Ku et al., 1999). However, a convincing quantitative assessment of its metabolic role in the context of a cell, an organ, a whole plant and a crop should accompany such claims (Fukayama et al., 2003; Sinclair et al., 2004). The possibility of resource rejection by higher plants (Thomas & Sadras, 2001) is often overlooked by molecular biologists, as is the concept of plasticity. Given the genetic complexity which underlies that plasticity, and that the ‘same’ crop is grown in geographically different regions with different climates, weather conditions and on different soil types with different histories of management, it is not surprising that in field experimentation precise repeatability, in the usual scientific sense, is the exception rather than the rule. As a result of this imprecision and the absence of universally acceptable theoretical models of crop growth, disagreements about what precisely determines both biomass and grain yield are commonplace. Consequently, even using systems approaches, it is no easy task to identify traits that will guarantee yield improvements. The conclusion that to make large increases in rice yield without further damaging the environment meant introducing the C4 pathway, was reached by taking a top-down view of crop performance and using simple crop systems modeling and crop experimentation. To make C4 rice a reality, the genes controlling the anatomical and biochemical networks distinguishing the C4 syndrome from the C3 syndrome must be discovered. This cannot be undertaken without the use of genetic engineering and ‘modern’ systems biology. Two approaches are being adopted: bioinformatics coupled to the identification of genes using mutagenesis; and the emergent properties of developing cells using ‘modern’ systems biology, as proposed by Nelson et al. (2007). In hindsight, the C4 rice concept was the result of trying to solve a problem using both the top-down and bottom-up approaches. Installing C4 in rice may be difficult, but that is different from impossible and it is worth bearing in mind the statement of Jones (2000) with respect to the sequencing of the human genome: ‘It reaffirmed one of the most misunderstood facts in science; that it is possible to solve most problems by throwing money at them’.",W2145231091,True,0.9568679928779602
https://doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.10596,Selection for domestication favored taxa characterized by fast growth and tolerance of high intraspecific density,"Societal Impact Statement To understand why certain plants have been domesticated into crops, we need to recognize that the environmental conditions plants experience in wild populations are totally different from those of agricultural fields. In this study, we investigated whether the characteristics that promote growth and survival in these different environments may have influenced domestication. Our results revealed that ancestral crops were selected because they developed better than other plants in dense single‐species stands, with selection for increased yield likely occurring after domestication. These insights shed light on the origins of agriculture and offer valuable guidance for future crop breeding efforts. Summary In spite of a large history of research, it is still unclear which functional traits may have mediated plant domestication. Solving this problem requires consideration of the ecological and demographic disparities between natural plant populations and cultivated fields. Since population density tends to be higher in the latter, we hypothesized that traits facilitating growth and survival in dense, monospecific populations might have been relevant for initial domestication. We investigated whether functional traits that respond to population density varied across three different domestication stages: undomesticated crop wild relatives, natural populations of crop progenitors, and landraces. To do this, we compared traits influencing competition (lodging; growth rate), resource acquisition (plant height; total aerial and root biomass) and yield (fruit number) in three annual legume crops—lentil, grasspea, and vetch—grown without resource limitation at three different densities. Our results showed clear differences among species, likely reflective of the distinct uses of the crops and their domestication pathways. Nevertheless, undomesticated relatives consistently differed from crop progenitors and landraces, producing smaller, slower‐growing plants that were more prostrate and allocated less biomass to roots. The effect of selection under domestication on these vegetative traits appeared to be largely negligible. Conversely, landraces produced more fruits. We conclude that early agriculturalists selected for domestication wild legumes that performed well in dense monocultures and were more effective in resource capture. Later domestication and breeding efforts likely had more significant effects on reproductive traits, such as fruit and seed production.",W4403550386,True,0.9463112354278564

The relative importance of these effects in shaping community responses to environmental change is incompletely understood. We employ a tri‐trophic food chain model with size‐ and temperature‐dependent vital rates and species interaction strengths to explore the role of direct kinetic effects of temperature and TSR on community structure along resource productivity and temperature gradients. We find that community structure, including the propensity for sudden collapse along resource productivity and temperature gradients, is primarily driven by the direct kinetic effects of temperature on vital rates and thermal mismatches between the consumer and predator species, overshadowing the TSR‐mediated effects.

Understanding the role of species as drivers of ecosystem processes is imperative to preserve, utilize, and sustain ecosystems globally. Addition of species through invasion and loss of species through extirpation or extinction can have profound effects on ecosystem structure and function (Zavaleta et al. 2009). This is especially true for freshwater ecosystems in which a preponderance of native species are threatened with extinction and where nonnative species are frequently introduced (Dudgeon and Smith 2006). Commonly, anthropogenic activities result in the loss of biodiversity and enhance the ability of exotic species to invade and persist in novel habitats (Dudgeon and Smith 2006). Because these activities are expected to increase through time, advances in understanding the consequences of species loss and addition on ecosystem function are needed to guide appropriate management and conservation decisions. The loss and addition of organisms may render habitats functionally impaired (Covich et al. 2004); therefore, understanding the consequences of such change is imperative to manage, mitigate, and restore freshwater ecosystems. We organized this oral session to examine experimental and theoretical work from studies of the addition of species and the loss of species from freshwater ecosystems. The overarching goal of this session was to begin designing a framework to quantify the effect of organisms on ecosystem processes among species and across systems. As a whole, the speakers addressed the following questions in a broad range of freshwater ecosystems: 1. What patterns emerge from studies examining changes in ecosystem function after species invasion and species loss? 2. Are these patterns consistent across study sites and study organisms? 3. Are there specific traits that make a species more apt to be an important driver of ecosystem function? The session focused on the effects of aquatic organisms on community structure and trophic relationships, primary productivity, organic matter processing, and nutrient dynamics. Several presentations highlighted the context-dependent nature of ecosystem change in response to species addition or loss in the face of anthropogenic pressures such as drought and eutrophication. During the session we also discussed how species-specific traits can be incorporated into unifying ways to understand and predict the effects of species gain and species loss on ecosystem processes among species and across freshwater ecosystems. The loss or invasion of a species in one habitat can change fluxes of materials and organisms within habitats and to adjacent or distant habitats, with consequences for food webs and ecosystem processes (Baxter et al. 2005, Mineau et al. 2012). Kate Boersma and colleagues documented decreased trophic trait diversity, specifically, the disappearance of top predators, in arid river systems in response to habitat fragmentation. She used experimental manipulations to test the effects of a top predator, Abedus herberti (Hemiptera: Belostomatidae), removal on community structure and basal food resources. In her experiment, the removal of Abedus instigated a trophic cascade and reduced algal fluorescence, likely caused by the release of the algae-grazing mayfly Callibaetis from Abedus predation. Top predator removal also changed the detritivore community by significantly reducing the abundance of the dominant consumer of coarse particulate organic matter, the caddisfly Phylloicus. Boersma's results documented that species loss alters biotic relationships and can be a strong driver of ecosystem change. In his presentation, Colden Baxter and colleagues summarized changes in between-habitat fluxes of materials and organisms using data collected from invading fish species on two continents. In Japan, he showed that invading rainbow trout triggered changes in feeding behavior of native char, which subsequently decreased aquatic insect emergence and riparian spider abundance (Baxter et al. 2004). Similarly, in western U.S. streams, Baxter and his coauthors addressed the question, “Is a trout a trout”? They demonstrated that invading brook trout, characterized by higher productivity and different trophic traits than native cutthroat trout, reduced the flux of emerging insects and riparian spider abundance relative to the native species. Baxter and others provided evidence that strong cross-habitat effects of species additions or losses can be caused by species with novel functional traits, trophic mismatches between invaders and native food webs, and relatively subtle differences in behavior of invasive species vs. the natives they replace. Native and introduced organisms can affect net ecosystem production through both direct and indirect pathways, potentially giving rise to interesting feedbacks between primary and secondary production (McIntyre et al. 2006) and decomposition (Rugenski et al. 2012). Work by Peter McIntyre and colleagues in Lake Tanganyika, East Africa, documented the effects of fishes in a species-rich system characterized by low ambient nutrients and high primary productivity. He used a coupled observational and experimental approach to understand how native grazing fish density and diversity influenced benthic algal productivity directly via consumption and indirectly via nutrient recycling. Grazers often suppress primary productivity by reducing algal biomass, though they can also stimulate new growth and select for vigorous algae (McIntyre et al. 2006). When nutrients are scarce, primary productivity can also be enhanced when grazers or higher-level consumers are recycling nutrients in readily available forms (McIntyre et al. 2006). McIntyre and his coauthors demonstrated that grazer density had strong positive effects on algal metabolism by mediating nutrient availability, and these effects exceeded direct negative effects of grazing on algal productivity. Overall, they documented how shifts in both community composition and fish density can affect ecosystem productivity, with a strong potential for positive feedbacks of grazing fishes. McIntyre and others concluded the gain or loss of grazing species from freshwater systems can have profound repercussions for productivity, and if positive effects predominate, then there is the potential for positive feedbacks between primary and secondary productivity that could give rise to highly productive systems despite nutrient scarcity. Two talks highlighted changes in organic matter processing rates after species addition or loss from aquatic ecosystems. Initially, Colden Baxter and colleagues described how the invasion of western U.S. riparian areas by Russian olive has altered stream organic matter budgets and nutrient dynamics. They suggested these changes were due to the ability of the invader to fix nitrogen, and because Russian olive produces low-quality leaf litter which decomposes slowly and is underutilized by native stream animals (Mineau et al. 2012). Conversely, Weston Nowlin and colleagues documented increased leaf litter decomposition rates in the presence of an invasive armored catfish, Hypostomus, in Texas rivers. Increased leaf litter decomposition rates were likely a result of increased mechanical disturbance of litter by Hypostomus during their movements and foraging activities. In both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, organisms directly affect nutrient storage and cycling by sequestering nutrients through growth and remineralizing nutrients via excretion and egestion (Vanni 2002). Although many studies have documented the effects of organisms on nutrient dynamics, there has not been a synthesis examining the effects of species losses and additions across systems. To understand the potential effects of the addition or loss of species on nutrient dynamics, many of the talks featured in the session summarized the influence of organisms on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) storage and cycling after species were added to or removed from freshwater ecosystems. Holistically, the presentations addressed a variety of species in diverse ecosystems. For example, presentations by Carla Atkinson and Amanda Rugenski and their collaborators highlighted the important functional role aquatic organisms can play in nutrient dynamics using three case studies: two assemblages of native species (freshwater mussels in Oklahoma and tadpoles in Panama) threatened with local extinction, and an invasive species (armored catfish in Mexico). Collectively, these case studies indicated the roles of animals in nutrient dynamics are species-specific, context-dependent, and biomass or density-dependent. For example, areal excretion and nutrient storage rates for native mussels was substantial among nine sample sites in Oklahoma. Among-site variation in this system was due to differences in densities and species composition of mussel communities. Similarly, in the Chacamax River in southern Mexico, introduced armored catfish attain an areal biomass that is two orders of magnitude greater than native fishes, thereby dominating the fluxes of nutrients through remineralization and the pools of nutrients stored in body tissues. Conversely, the substantial influence on nutrient cycling and storage by native tadpoles in Panama was primarily density-dependent. Coupled with the effects of urbanization, eutrophication, and water extraction, the effects of species addition and species loss on ecosystem function can be magnified (Covich et al. 2004, Zavaleta et al. 2009). Climate change and water withdrawals in arid regions are causing once-perennial streams to fragment or dry completely (Jackson et al. 2001). Several talks highlighted the potential and realized threat that water extraction will play on the loss of organisms from freshwater habitats and the subsequent changes in ecosystem function. For example, Caryn Vaughn quantified the influence of drought and water extraction on the functional roles of freshwater mussels in Oklahoma rivers. Freshwater mussels are large, long-lived suspension feeders that provide important ecosystem services in rivers such as biofiltration, nutrient recycling, and nutrient storage (Vaughn and Hakenkamp 2001). At the whole-river scale, extensive mussel loss led to major changes in nutrient dynamics and biofiltration. Vaughn highlighted that many of the changes in ecosystem function could have been prevented had water been released from an upstream tributary to alleviate high water temperatures, which exceeded 40°C in some locations. Drought in this region is predicted to become both more frequent and more severe with climate change, as human population grows and uses more water. Two speakers in the session highlighted potential interactions between eutrophication and the effects of invasive organisms on ecosystem function in freshwaters. Cayelan Carey and colleagues presented work on the influence of lake trophic status and cyanobacterial blooms in the northeastern United States. Cyanobacterial blooms have large effects on community structure and ecosystem processes (Smith 2003), and are predicted to increase in aquatic systems worldwide due to eutrophication (Brookes and Carey 2011). Many studies have demonstrated that cyanobacteria have inhibitory effects on other plankton; however, most of this work has been conducted under high ambient nutrient conditions. Carey and coauthors examined how the trophic state of a lake could mediate relationships between cyanobacterial blooms, food web ecology, and nutrient dynamics. They found that at low ambient nutrient levels, the effect of emergent cyanobacteria had a stimulatory effect on the growth and diversity of other phytoplankton because the cyanobacteria increased water column nutrient concentrations. However, in high ambient nutrient concentrations, these effects were reversed. Predicting when and where nonnative species become established and whether these species become invasive is poorly understood, but may vary with environmental conditions such as ambient chemistry. Armored catfishes (Loricariidae) have invaded aquatic systems throughout the world and are of concern because they affect trophic and nutrient dynamics (Pound et al. 2011). Weston Nowlin and colleagues presented the results of a study examining the relationship between the growth and impacts of an introduced loricariid and nutrient enrichment in a replicated stream channel experiment. Nowlin and others found the effects of catfish were largely independent from those of nutrients, indicating that nutrient enrichment may have a limited role in mediating or exacerbating the impacts of catfishes. However, the body condition (lipid concentration and biomass) of loricariids was enhanced in the presence of increased nutrients. The work by Carey, Nowlin and their coauthors highlights the context dependence of the effects of species invasion and loss on community structure and ecosystem function. Moreover, their data suggests that the synergistic effects of multiple environmental stressors may alter the effect of species addition or loss on ecosystem dynamics in unexpected ways. One of the great challenges to understanding general patterns in functional changes in ecosystems after species invasion or extirpation is to be able to compare disparate species among study sites. Two of the speakers, Moore and Rugenski, focused their talks on understanding some of these general patterns. Anthropogenic environmental change is driving community disassembly through simultaneous declines of native species coupled with increases in nonnative species. Previous studies suggest that community disassembly is somewhat predictable, and species traits determine whether or not an organism is a successful invader or is sensitive to anthropogenic change (Zavaleta et al. 2009). Similarly, there is an increased understanding that the ecosystem consequences of community change will be influenced by the traits of species that compose the novel community. However, there is still a need to integrate patterns of community change with subsequent ecosystem consequences (Zavaleta et al. 2009). In their presentation, Jonathan Moore and coauthor examined two connected questions: First, how have communities fallen apart and how are they being put back together? Second, given the pattern of community disassembly, what are the predicted changes to ecosystem processes? To address these questions, they used existing data sets of fishes in >5000 sites in the United States to quantify spatial patterns of community disassembly across gradients of urbanization. Moore and coauthor quantified patterns of community disassembly in fishes across the United States, and they found that varying biological and ecological traits among species determined their inferred vulnerabilities to anthropogenic habitat modification. For example, some ecosystem processes were governed by allometric rules, such as nutrient excretion. Thus, distinctive vulnerabilities of differently sized taxa will drive nonlinear ecosystem consequences. Alternatively, other ecosystem processes appeared not to be linked to vulnerability. Together, these results were used to parameterize realistic extinction scenarios. The simulations revealed that habitat alteration can decrease ecosystem processes. Thus, insights into community disassembly rules can shed light on the ecosystem consequences of human-induced environmental change. Amanda Rugenski and coauthors identified patterns of changes in consumer-driver nutrient remineralization after species addition or loss across study sites and organisms. They attempted to determine what specific-species traits make organisms more apt to be drivers of ecosystem function in freshwater systems. Rugenski and coauthors proposed using volumetric excretion (Ev) (McIntyre et al. 2008) as a unifying method to assess the impacts of species additions and losses in lotic ecosystems under different environmental conditions and spatial scales. They used the three examples presented in Carla Atkinson's talk (see above) to highlight the roles of animals and their potential impact on nutrient cycling. Rugenski and others modeled Ev for ammonium (N) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) for several organisms. In the three case studies they presented, aquatic organisms had profound effects on nutrient dynamics in freshwater ecosystems. Species functional traits, such as stoichiometry and feeding behavior, were important in determining the spatial extent of an organisms' influence on nutrient dynamics. Moreover, Rugenski and others suggested the physiochemical characteristics of the environment, including nutrient limitation, discharge, temperature, and the biophysical traits of the organism (e.g., trophic state, biomass and density), were all important factors in predicting the role of organisms in nutrient dynamics. The results from their presentations highlight that uniform methods can be used to express species-specific effects on nutrient dynamics across freshwater ecosystems. In order to appropriately legislate, manage, and conserve freshwater ecosystems, it is imperative to pursue cross-habitat and cross-species comparisons to describe the functional roles of aquatic organisms in ecosystem processes. The work presented in this session and subsequent discussions highlighted that species addition and loss from freshwater ecosystems frequently results in changes in ecosystem function. Comprehensively, the presentations suggested novel functional traits, such as body and dietary stoichiometry, trophic mismatches between invaders and native food webs, and differences in behavior among species challenge the concept of functional redundancy. Altogether, presentations in the session indicate that the addition or loss of a keystone or dominant species or group of organisms from freshwaters will typically result in changes in ecosystem structure and function. Future studies should generate and utilize unifying metrics that would allow scientists and managers to compare effects of species addition and species loss across taxa and ecosystems. These metrics should be measured in conjunction with other environmental parameters such as urbanization, eutrophication, and water extraction to elucidate potentially unexpected conflicting or synergistic effects of multiple anthropogenic activities in freshwater habitats and watersheds. Part of the motivation for understanding the effects of species addition and loss is to develop management strategies that would enable human populations to utilize natural resources while sustaining natural systems and preserving the functions that are both ecologically and economically valuable. Furthermore, a great challenge that ecologists face is to quantify these changes and the subsequent losses of ecosystem services and make them relevant to the public. For example, in her discussion of freshwater mussel loss in Oklahoma rivers, Caryn Vaughn highlighted that drought in the south-central United States is predicted to become both more frequent and more severe with climate change, and water consumption will increase with population growth. Vaughn pointed out that while the frequency and severity of droughts cannot be controlled in the short term, the management of water resources can be effectively administered to maintain healthy populations of freshwater mussels and the ecosystem services they provide. Through her presentation, she emphasized the importance of quantifying ecosystem services provided by species to support conservation efforts on their behalf. There is a pressing need for scientists to quantify changes in ecosystem function into economically valued ecosystem services that can be incorporated into management and conservation efforts. We would like to acknowledge all of the coauthors of the presented talks for their contribution to these ideas and the people who attended the session.",W1995165202,True,0.9219244122505188

Thousands of practitioners in hundreds of institutions around the world make idiosyncratic decisions about which questions to study, which organisms to use, and for how long, guided by a combination of individual predilection, inspiration from journals and books, and exchanges of progress reports and discussion at professional meetings. No synod of presbyters sets priorities, and no court of sagacious elders adjudicates disputes over which theory is the better explanation for a collection of data. From this swirling mix, principles form and a body of knowledge emerges. These are then collected into monographs and textbooks whose consistency might seem little short of miraculous, given the process. As in many academic disciplines, the epistemic basis of ecology and evolutionary biology, the set of principles and facts that we believe to be true, is the cumulative result of a remarkable self‐organizing process.Ecology and evolutionary biology are not focused on the uniform behavior of fundamental particles but on fundamental processes that unfold in a variety of contexts from a variety of histories. In that light, the most critical decision in the inquiry portion of our science is the match of question to organism (or system). That is, within this self‐organizing enterprise, how do we choose which organisms to employ to answer a question or, conversely, which questions to ask of a specific organism? If our epistemic basis is the cumulative result of these choices, then the principles and facts that emerge will be only as reliable as our choices have been wise.Here I explore how the decision to match organism to question influences what we believe to be so. In the first section, I take the pragmatic perspective of a working scientist and describe how we make the match. In the next section, I take a more formal perspective, following in part the work of Burian (1993), and describe how we should make the match; that is, I outline the criteria that ought to guide our decisions. In the final section, I explore how closely what we actually do approaches what we should do and discuss whether certain facets of our discipline warrant closer attention to the process by which we match organism to question and, thereby, derive what we believe to be so.How Do We Match Question and Organism?For many scientists, the organism leads to the question. This path is most likely when we observe some of nature's most striking phenomena, such as the synchronous mass flowering of south Asian bamboo (Keeley and Bond 1999) or the curious jugular location of the anus in pirate perch, Aphredoderus sayanus (Fletcher et al. 2004). We ask why something out of the ordinary has emerged; when we encounter mass flowering in bamboo, our first thought is not ""I wonder what the specific leaf area of these plants might be,"" nor do we observe pirate perch and wonder immediately whether the population's superoxide dismutase gene shows extensive variation.Many of us work from organism to question in more routine contexts. That is, we make an observation that interests us and then direct our questions to it. Followed faithfully, this approach usually leads to research that crosses lines between subdisciplines and often leads to some striking discoveries about the organism. For example, the work that my colleagues, students, and I performed on sailfin mollies Poecilia latipinna began when Jim Farr and I noticed that molly populations varied widely in their body size distributions and that closely adjacent populations sometimes had extremely different distributions (fig. 1). We were not the first to notice this pattern, of course (see Kilby 1955; Hubbs 1964; Snelson 1985), but we were the most tenacious in our desire to explain it. Our subsequent studies embraced behavior (Farr et al. 1986; Farr and Travis 1986; Travis and Woodward 1989; Ptacek and Travis 1996), life history (Farr and Travis 1989; Travis et al. 1989; Trexler and Travis 1990; Trexler et al. 1990), demography (Trexler et al. 1992, 1994), population genetics (Trexler 1988), reproductive biology (Trexler 1985; Travis 1989), mating system (Travis et al. 1990; Sumner et al. 1994; Ptacek and Travis 1997; Trexler et al. 1997), and physiological ecology (McManus and Travis 1998). The work revealed several striking phenomena, including facultative matrotrophy (Trexler 1985), spontaneous ovarian cycling (Travis 1989), an olfactory cue for female receptivity (Sumner et al. 1994), and Y‐linked inheritance of male body size (Travis 1994).Figure 1: Some of the animals, plants, and places involved in my own research.

Hypotheses for even the most striking observations are usually guided by theory; Janzen's 1976 essay is a masterful application of existing life‐history theory to the mass flowering of bamboo. In fact, organism‐inspired research often leads to new theory; with the passage of time, mass flowering turned out to be but one example of a broader phenomenon of synchronous reproduction, and theory aimed at that phenomenon followed accordingly (review in Ims 1990). In our molly work, although the initial question might appear agnostic to theory except in its broadest sense, the theory of local adaptation, many of the individual investigations relied heavily on existing mathematical theory for developing specific, testable hypotheses (Reznick and Travis 2001).Alternatively, the question can lead to the organism, in any of three ways. First, we may choose to employ a model system, such as Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Zea mays, or Arabidopsis thaliana, to study a problem. Model systems may be the only practical choice for problems such as mutation accumulation (Mukai et al. 1972; Fry et al. 1999; Shaw et al. 2000; Baer et al. 2005), and they are often a convenient choice for a novel approach to a conceptual question (Travisano et al. 1995; Joshi et al. 2003). Model systems offer a faster and more forgiving path for an intricate study of a general problem that can be addressed in any of many systems—at least in principle—but can be addressed more quickly or more extensively with the model system. Several excellent programs have taken this path; among them are Mueller's studies of evolution in response to density (Mueller et al. 2000), the scrutiny of the genetic response to selection on a quantitative trait conducted by Mackay and colleagues (Mackay 2001), and the exploration of adaptation to thermal regimes led by Lenski and Bennett (Cullum et al. 2001).Model systems reveal what can happen in nature but not necessarily what does happen. In this light, studies with model systems guide those of us who work with natural populations to consider what might have happened in nature and what the alternative happenings might have been. Studies with model systems have also facilitated the development of methods and techniques that can be applied to natural populations so that we can better understand what does happen in nature. This ""technology transfer"" has been especially fruitful for large‐scale evolutionary studies with Drosophila that have helped us learn not just from model systems but also about them. Examples include the scrutiny of variation in life history (Coyne and Beecham 1987), morphology (Mezey and Houle 2005), physiology (David and Bocquet 1975; Gilchrist and Huey 2004), biochemistry (Oakeshott et al. 1982), host‐pathogen relationships (Jaenike and Perlman 2002), convergent evolution (Balanyà et al. 2003), isolating mechanisms (Coyne and Orr 1997; Noor 1997), and genetic responses to global climate change (Etges and Levitan 2004; Umina et al. 2005).The second path from question to organism emerges when a sound test of theory requires a system whose features match important theoretical assumptions and a scientist with a strong natural‐history background recognizes the propriety of a particular organism or system. The work of Wilbur (1972) and Morin (1983, 1986) with amphibians on the interaction of predation and resource competition in community ecology is a clear example. Their deep knowledge of natural history is implicit in this work and was vital to its success; not only did they recognize the propriety of the systems, but they were adept at creating realistic experimental conditions in which the organisms could grow and develop as they do in nature.The third way in which the question leads to the organism occurs when a particular theory unifies seemingly disparate phenomena and, in effect, tells us to look more widely for patterns that we would not otherwise have sought. Charnov's work on the evolution of sex allocation (synthesized in Charnov 1982) is an excellent example. Charnov offered a general theory that applied to sex ratios in gonochoristic animals, the circumstances under which hermaphrodites could displace gonochores, the allocation to male and female function in simultaneous hermaphrodites, and the way optimal allocation to gender function in sequential hermaphrodites should vary with age or size. This work helped inspire a host of empirical studies in a diversity of systems (e.g., Ashman and Baker 1992; Peterson and Fischer 1996; Roy et al. 2003), and sex allocation theory remains a vibrant topic (see, e.g., Pen and Weissing 1999; Sakai 2000; Cadet et al. 2004).Finally, as individual careers progress, some of us change the questions we ask of the organisms we study, and some of us change the organisms we use to address a particular question. We do so, as Burian (1993) describes, when our curiosity about an organism leads us to new questions or when we approach the limits to an organism's utility for a particular question. Bradshaw's work on pitcher‐plant mosquitoes Wyeomyia smithii traces an arc from his early studies of mutualism between arthropods and pitcher plants (Bradshaw and Creelman 1984) through studies of life history (Bradshaw 1986) to his recent work on hourglass timers and the regulation of circadian and annual rhythms (Bradshaw et al. 2003). Conversely, Huey's work on thermal ecology and the evolution of thermal response moved from a focus on lizards (Huey and Bennett 1987) to the employment of a model system, Drosophila melanogaster (Gilchrist et al. 1997), to a scrutiny of thermal effects on adaptation in natural populations of Drosophila subobscura (Gilchrist and Huey 2004).In rare cases, some of us take the opportunity late in our careers to return to particular questions about specific organisms on which we focused years before, in order to resolve the outstanding issues. Sometimes this return is facilitated by new technology or methods and sometimes by altered personal circumstances. Perhaps the best example is Hairston's remarkable studies of how competition and predation affect the distribution and abundance of plethodontid salamanders; the experimental studies in the latter part of his career (Hairston 1980a, 1980b, 1983, 1986) were separated from the observational studies of his early years (Hairston 1949, 1951) by a rich vein of diverse ecological work (Hairston 1958, 1959, 1967, 1969; Hairston et al. 1960; Hairston and Kellerman 1964, 1965; among many others).How Should We Match Question to Organism?Two general considerations ought to dictate how we choose our organisms, that is, how we match question to organism. First, we should choose on the basis of ""suitability,"" which describes the quality of the reciprocal match of question and organism (Burian 1993). Second, we should take into account that, to borrow again from Burian (1993), the fundamental epistemology of ecology and evolutionary biology is comparative. That is, we can discover what is general only from a broad set of comparisons, and we can often understand the special case only through its relationship to the general pattern. I explore each of these considerations in turn.SuitabilityFollowing Burian (1993), we claim that a specific organism or study system is suitable for a particular question if it fulfills two requirements. First, the organism or system must be tractable for the question; that is, we must be able actually to find it and work with it. This requirement is familiar to every practicing ecologist or evolutionary biologist, and we often take great pains to assure reviewers of grant proposals that indeed we can work with a particular organism. Model systems are created when an extremely tractable organism is discovered to have peculiar but interesting properties; many organisms are easy to raise in the laboratory, but the ability to identify and delineate cell lineages made C. elegans the nematode of choice.The second requirement is that the question actually be relevant for the organism. Burian (1993, p. 353) states it slightly differently, asking ""whether the model [here the organism or system] is faithful in relevant ways to that for which it is supposed to serve as a model."" In the simplest case, we can ask whether the organism or system meets the assumptions of the theory or concept under consideration; for example, Morin (1983, 1986) selected his anuran prey and their predators because they exhibited the properties that the theory under scrutiny took as fundamental assumptions, so his system was suitable for his purpose. In a deeper case, we can ask directly whether the question itself applies to the organism. For example, the interpretation of an experimental study of the adaptive significance of cannibalism in an animal is open to question if no evidence suggests that the animal engages in cannibalism in nature. We could raise this question in many other contexts, from mate copying (Is the mating system such that copying is possible?) to predator functional responses (Do predators or parasitoids show density‐dependent attack rates in the natural range of densities?); Gunzburger and Travis (2005) have questioned the interpretation of many reports of unpalatability of tadpoles because the tadpoles were offered to predators that rarely, if ever, encounter them in nature.In a subtle variation, we can ask whether the experimental treatments employed to test a concept create a misleading result; that is, the question may apply, but the design and execution of the experiment may create artificial conditions that can bias the outcome in a particular direction. Expressed yet another way, the question applies but the experiment does not. For example, Jaeger and Walls (1989) criticized experimental studies of anuran populations and communities conducted in enclosures or mesocosms (large tanks set up as artificial ponds) because, among other reasons, the experiments up to that time had employed densities far higher than were measured in nature. The concern was that such experiments could not help but implicate an important role for biotic interactions in this system, a role that may not be fulfilled at lower, presumably more natural densities. Subsequent experiments at much lower densities (e.g., Warner et al. 1991, 1993; Gascon and Travis 1992) revealed the same effects seen in the earlier studies but found, indeed, that the strength of the biotic effects had previously been overestimated.Suitability of an organism has two important features. First, suitability can be specific to a particular context (Zallen 1993). Sailfin mollies in north Florida have proved suitable for studies of sexual selection and mating‐system variation but not for numerical dynamics; the effects of tidal fluctuations in salt marshes and the physical structure of these habitats precluded reliable sampling for population densities. Working in the Everglades, however, Trexler and his colleagues have found sailfin mollies quite suitable subjects for studying numerical dynamics, among other topics (Trexler et al. 2002).Second, the suitability of a system for a question may change as other questions are addressed and answered in the system. For example, the genetic control of pattern variation in Papilio dardanus offers important insights into the origin of mimicry, but the full utility of this system became apparent only after Nijhout's work on the developmental biology of lepidopteran wings (Nijhout 2002, 2003). The value of protein variation within many fish species for studying the genetic basis of adaptive variation improved dramatically when sophisticated methods for determining protein structure at a very fine scale were developed, along with the ability to determine the detailed sequence and structure of the genes involved (see Hochachka and Somero 2002). Suitability need not always improve; the discovery of reciprocal chromosome translocations in Oenothera lamarckiana compromised its suitability as a system for illustrating the constraints on the response to selection on quantitative traits (Provine 1971).Recognizing the Comparative Nature of Our EpistemologyThe comparative nature of our epistemology dictates three principles that ought to guide our collective choice of organisms.A well‐sampled spectrum is necessary for understanding diversity and defining generalities. To be specific, a well‐sampled spectrum serves to define the most common patterns and processes and identify the circumstances through which less common patterns and outcomes emerge. Of course, morphologists have known and applied this principle for centuries; understanding peculiar anatomical variations such as the fangs of venomous snakes or the toothless gape of egg‐eating specialist snakes requires appreciating a spectrum of ophidian skull morphology (Gans 1974). The principle is becoming well appreciated in ""molecular morphology"" as well; the spectrum of variation in the structure of the antifreeze glycoproteins in fish, when combined with genomic information in a phylogenetic context, reveals an astounding story of convergence and idiosyncrasy in adaptation (Fletcher et al. 2001).New discoveries can change tentative generalities. Although the scientific process stimulates a continuous refinement of our epistemic basis, from time to time new discoveries overturn a paradigm completely. Not all cases are historical; a recent example is the change in our view of life‐history evolution in the desmognathine salamanders. The traditional view was that direct development, the loss of the aquatic larval stage, was a recently derived life history, a sensible view in light of how few directly developing desmognathines were known and how extremely limited were their geographic and habitat distributions. However, the discovery in the 1960s of the directly developing species Phaeognathus hubrichti, a more complete understanding of species' distributions and ecology, and the employment of sophisticated molecular methods for testing phylogenetic hypotheses have combined to indicate that direct development is the ancestral condition (Chippindale et al. 2004; Mueller et al. 2004).We can identify other recent examples in which new discoveries, empirical or theoretical, called existing paradigms into question. Polis's (1991) detailed description of omnivory in a desert food web, following Paine's (1988) critique of food web theory, helped redirect that theory. Reznick et al.'s (1997) documentation of rapid evolution of guppy life histories helped usher in a new perspective on the likelihood of very rapid evolution (Kinnison and Hendry 2001; Reznick and Ghalambor 2001; Frankham and Kingsolver 2004). Spichtig and Kawecki's (2004) examination of multilocus soft selection in a subdivided population revealed that, in general, such soft selection does not protect extensive genetic variation; the impression to the contrary has been cultivated by generalization from the earliest single‐locus models of the process, and the generalization appears to have been misleading.Robust inference requires horizontal comparisons and vertical integration. Our modern emphasis on process biology puts high value on horizontal comparisons, the examination of the same question at the same level in a variety of systems. Horizontal comparisons have revealed general processes, such as the reciprocal‐yield and 3/2 thinning laws in plants (Harper 1977), trophic cascades (Carpenter and Kitchell 1993), and the preference of females for male signals associated with size or vigor (MacLaren et al. 2004). When horizontal comparisons are synthesized quantitatively, larger generalities often emerge; the patterns of biogeography are an excellent example (Brown 1984; Harte et al. 1999; Hubbell 2001).A truly robust epistemic basis for ecology and evolutionary biology also requires vertical integration, the study of many ecological and evolutionary processes as they unfold in a single species or system. Indeed, one might argue that the great challenge of biology in this century will be to connect our understanding across different levels of organization. Many of us are devoting more effort toward such integration; indeed, a number of species and systems have emerged as ""natural models"" for the study of an integrated ecology and evolutionary biology, including animals such as Poecilia reticulata and Gasterosteus aculeatus and plants such as Silene latifolia and Trifolium repens. A sampling of recent literature devoted to S. latifolia includes studies of genetic population structure (Giraud 2004; Ingvarsson 2004; Tellier et al. 2005), molecular evolution (Sugiyama et al. 2003; Ingvarsson 2004; Lengerova et al. 2004; Filatov 2005), floral genetics (Delph et al. 2004a; Meagher et al. 2005) and development (Ageez et al. 2003; Delph et al. 2004b; Matsunaga et al. 2004), nectar production and composition (Gehring et al. 2004; Dotterl et al. 2005), and invasion biology (Wolfe et al. 2004). The value of integrated knowledge is aptly illustrated in the studies by Brakefield and his colleagues on the evolution and ecology of the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana (Fischer et al. 2003, 2004; Molleman et al. 2004; Zijlstra et al. 2004; Frankino et al. 2005; Saccheri et al. 2005; Steigenga et al. 2005; van't Hof et al. 2005).Does Our Self‐Organizing System Enforce Suitability and Encourage a Comparative Epistemology?Without doubt, our system encourages one aspect of suitability, that the organism be tractable for the question. Proposals to funding agencies rarely trumpet that the proposed study organism is sparsely distributed, occurs in low numbers, is difficult to find and impossible to maintain, has critical features that cannot be measured, or is otherwise intractable for careful observation or deployment in powerful experiments. One cannot imagine a phylogenetics proposal that points out that the group to be studied has no informative characters or that the only genes that can be sequenced evolve at rates that cannot resolve the relationships among the member taxa.Whether we give sufficient encouragement to considering whether the question applies to the organism is another issue. If the literature includes declarations of prey unpalatability diagnosed from predators that do not encounter the prey (Gunzburger and Travis 2005), then it probably holds many examples of inappropriately directed questions that are less easily recognized by readers without extensive familiarity with the organism. In these cases, the organisms are being used, in effect, as analog simulations of an interesting ecological or evolutionary process. If this is the real idea behind such work, genuine digital simulations would seem a much wiser choice (see, e.g., Yedid and Bell 2001; Chow et al. 2004).Our best‐known systems, both model systems and ""natural models,"" are not random samples of their larger groups. Our model systems are, by and large, human commensals that have probably experienced rapid population growth in the last several thousand years. Although we can argue over which genetic or genomic properties might be biased by this history, expecting no bias would be naive. For example, the chiasma frequencies of domesticated mammals are not representative of those in mammals as a whole (Burt and Bell 1987). Many of our emerging ""natural models"" are cosmopolitan taxa usually found at high densities (Poecilia reticulata is an obvious exception to the cosmopolitan attribute). This is not to claim that these systems offer idiosyncratic results but to argue that we will not recognize which results are idiosyncratic without a wider foundation of comparative investigation.Whether the conclusions we draw from our horizontal comparisons are sufficiently robust depends on whether we have sampled taxonomic and character diversity properly. Although practitioners of meta‐analyses or comparative studies worry explicitly about their sampling of taxa or characters, we may not worry enough about the sampling of our examples when we attempt a synthesis or seek generalizations. We sometimes make premature generalizations or fail to appreciate fully that a particular generalization might not be robust because it emerges from a circumscribed sample of systems, a limited range of diversity, or a peculiar set of experiments. For example, the earliest studies of biochemical variation were motivated in part by the possibility that generalizations about the ubiquity of adaptive genetic variation might be overly influenced by their emergence from studies of visible polymorphisms (Lewontin 1974). In another arena, ecologists argue whether trophic cascades are a general or a circumscribed phenomenon, and one part of this argument seems, at least to me, to maintain that their apparent prominence was a premature generalization from marine and aquatic systems (Polis and Strong 1996; Oksanen and Oksanen 2000).Even less clear is that we wrestle with the sampling of taxonomic, character, and system diversity when we conceive and design our original empirical work. We often let the organism lead to the question or find the most tractable organism for a question rather than seeking an organism or system whose attributes place it in an especially critical position for understanding the broad issue at hand. Reznick's study of the life‐history diversity in female poeciliid fishes illustrates how, ideally, we would approach these problems (Reznick and Miles 1989; Reznick et al. 1992, 2002; Arias and Reznick 2000); his initial survey isolated critical questions and critical taxa, and his subsequent efforts have been focused accordingly. Of course, ""ideal"" is not always possible or practical, and most of the time the best we can do may be to build our generalities and principles gradually from the organisms and systems that are available and suitable.An emerging issue is whether we apply the criteria of suitability when we embark on meta‐analyses or other exploitations of preexisting data. Obviously, we employ the first criterion of suitability, which is tractability; the data are available, so we use them. Whether those data are faithful, in relevant ways, to the question for which they will be exploited, even though they were collected for another purpose, is the critical issue.This issue is central to an already large and still‐burgeoning literature in ecology and evolutionary biology that exploits preexisting data of one sort or another. For example, the ecomorphological community studies of Ricklefs and Travis (Ricklefs and Travis 1980; Travis and Ricklefs 1983) are based on measurements of museum specimens—one type of preexisting data—and their validity relies on the assumption that those specimens are representative samples of the morphological variation in those species in those areas. Museum or herbarium specimens have been used to approach a wide variety of topics in ecology and evolutionary biology (see recent articles by McGlynn [1999], Simberloff et al. [2000], and Knouft [2003]); some conclusions are more likely than others to be robust to collection biases.The use of tabulated and archived data in meta‐analyses and synthetic analyses carries its own risks of inadvertent bias. In some cases, such as studies of numerical dynamics, the data are being used for the same purpose for which they were collected (e.g., Kendall et al. 1998), but in others, data collected for one purpose are exploited for a different one, and in these cases the potential for bias is an important issue. For example, many early quantitative analyses of food webs exploited data that were collected as by‐products of other work (Cohen et al. 1993), and substantial biases were present (Paine 1988).The biases can arise in many ways. For example, Jeff Leips and I published a study of numerical dynamics in Heterandria formosa that included density estimates of many other species (Leips and Travis 1999).

https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.4395,Plant neighbors differentially alter a focal species' biotic interactions through changes to resource allocation,"Abstract Plant resource allocation strategies are thought to be largely a consequence of changing abiotic conditions and evolutionary history. However, biotic interactions also influence how a plant allocates resources. As a result, plants mediate indirect interactions between organisms above‐ and belowground through resource allocation. Neighboring plants can influence plant fitness directly through competition for resources, and indirectly by altering associated community interactions (associational effects), such as pollination, herbivory, and a suite of belowground interactions. Given the importance of community interactions for plant success, and the known ability for plant neighbors to change these interactions, the goal of this “pandemic project” was to understand how heterospecific plant neighbors alter plant resource allocation, whether this occurred through above‐ or belowground mechanisms, and whether this in turn alters biotic interactions and the relationship between a focal plant and its herbivore and soil community interactions. To do so, we established a common garden experiment, manipulating plant neighbor identity and the extent of interaction among neighbors (aboveground only, vs. above‐ and belowground interactions, using customized pot types), and measured changes to a focal plant and its biotic interactions over two growing seasons. We found evidence of both neighbor effects and pot type, showing that neighbor interactions affect a focal plant through both above‐ and belowground processes, and how the focal plant is affected depends on neighbor identity. Though neighbors did not directly alter herbivory or most soil microbial interactions, they did alter the relationship between belowground microbial communities and a plant response trait (specific leaf area). Plant resource allocation responses were reduced with time, showing the importance of extending experiments beyond a single growing season, and are an important consideration when making predictions about plant responses to changing conditions. This study contributes to a growing body of work showing how community contexts affect the above‐ and belowground interactions of a plant through plant resource allocation strategies.",W4402629330,True,0.9315423965454102
https://doi.org/10.1002/bes2.1607,Toward “Rules” for Studying Biological Invasions,"Biological invasions are a key facet of global change, with documented rates of establishment of nonnative species rising exponentially over the last several decades across most taxa and all biological realms (Essl et al. 2011). This redistribution of the Earth's biodiversity has caused substantial health and economic harm to human societies and will affect current and future ecological and evolutionary dynamics. The field of invasion science has grown in relevance and purview as a result (Lockwood et al. 2013). This growth has mirrored that observed in environmental biology as a whole in terms of the variety of approaches employed, including laboratory experiments, smaller-scale field experiments, long-term field experiments, computational modeling, and the assembly and analysis of observational ""big data"" sets gathered across multiple temporal and spatial scales. However, integrating these scientific approaches and their inherent spatial and temporal scales has proven challenging. In particular, invasion scientists have struggled to identify a coherent definition, measurement schema, and theory behind nonnative invasive species impacts (Blackburn et al. 2014, Jeschke et al. 2014). Species must cross distinct stages, or barriers, before they reach the last stage of this process and earn the moniker of ""invasive"" (Blackburn et al. 2014). Invasive species thus are those that are well established and often increasing in population size and realize some geographical range expansion. Because they are widespread and abundant, invasive species tend also to impose major ecological effects on co-occurring native populations, communities of native species, or the entire native ecosystem (Lockwood et al. 2013). These effects can be positive, negative, or both and may affect factors that human society values, or they may not (Jeschke et al. 2014). When these effects are considered notably detrimental to ecosystems, they are often labeled as negative impacts, with a recent move to also label effects that are considered to have positive benefits to species or people as positive impacts. A primary barrier to developing invasive species' impact theories is that they integrate biological mechanisms that span from individuals up to whole ecosystems and can thus be emergent and complex outcomes of how individual organisms interact with each other and their environment. Specific invasions are often idiosyncratic and thus must be studied in detail (Elliott-Graves 2016). Recognizing that any ""rules"" associated with biological invasions are inductively derived and have many possible exceptions, we organized a week-long workshop to explore approaches to explain and predict invasive species' impacts. The workshop, funded by the National Science Foundation Rules of Life initiative, took place on May 2019 at the Alton Jones Campus of the University of Rhode Island. Participants were intentionally chosen from a range of scientific backgrounds in order to ensure neglected aspects of biological invasions are included. This effort resulted in the majority of participating scientists not having invasions as their primary research focus (Fig. 1). We took a broad, multidisciplinary approach by bringing together population and community ecologists with physiologists and data scientists to explore how organisms respond and adapt to dynamic and stressful environments, which is a hallmark of invasive species. We sought to identify novel approaches to the analysis of invasive species' evolutionary adaptation, range expansion, and ecological impacts through the explicit recognition of a fundamental link between an organism's physiology and its environment and how this relationship varies through space and time (Chown 2012, Lennox et al. 2015). Ultimately, by continuing to work with the participants post-workshop, our goal is to advance a coherent physiological ecology theory that can integrate across biological, spatial, and temporal scales of invasions to inform future research approaches. Here, we define physiology to include, for both plants and animals, the functions and processes that occur at the level of individual organisms and that manifest through an organism's interaction with its biotic and abiotic environment. This definition includes a variety of fundamental biological processes such as mechanisms of nutrient, water, and energy acquisition; thermoregulation and responses to extreme conditions; behavioral and hormonal responses to environmental stress; and the timing of critical life history events. These physiological processes underpin the ability of invasive species to survive sub-optimal conditions and their propensity to evolve in the face of environmental stress, which in turn dictate the likelihood that an invasive species will reach an abundance and range size likely to cause ecological impacts (Funk 2013, Behrens et al. 2017). Although these insights have previously received some attention in invasion science (Lennox et al. 2015), they have not yet coalesced into a coherent research agenda within the field. The allied approach of conservation physiology (Cooke et al. 2013, Madlinger et al. 2016) touches on aspects of invasion biology but (as yet) has not fully addressed the insights that a physiological approach to invasion science can offer (Lennox et al. 2015). Our primary thesis is that the range expansion and ecological impacts of invasive species can be profitably approached as a problem of ecological and physiological integration across biological scales from individuals up to ecosystems and landscapes. Below we elaborate on the three related approaches to exploring biological, spatial, and temporal scales that were our focus for this workshop: mechanistic physiological models of invasive species distributions, the physiological basis of invasive species ecological impacts, and insights resulting from data integration that allows research on biological integration. Predicting the spread and ultimate range limits (as well as possible impacts) of invasive species is both an interesting scientific challenge and an important prerequisite for developing effective responses and wisely allocating resources to managing invasions. There is a growing need to predict the geographical range potential and spread rates of invasive species, as such estimates provide a basis for risk assessment, population management, and identification and mitigation of impacts (Jeschke and Strayer 2008, Grayson and Johnson 2018). Species distribution models (SDMs), also known as environmental niche models (ENMs), have been used since well before the inception of modern invasion science (Gjullin 1931) to forecast the potential spread of nonnative species; reviews abound (Elith and Leathwick 2009, Merow et al. 2014a). Because of the ready availability of a variety of such models and the increasing accessibility of native range data plus environmental data layers and GIS platforms, use of these models has increased dramatically and dominates this area of invasion science. Although such models can give a rough, broad-brush picture of a species' ultimate spread, predictions can err in both directions. Species distribution models can fail to indicate a region that becomes invaded or indicate an invasion where none has (yet) occurred. Combined, these errors leave SDMs capable of predicting at a very large scale, at least over large regions, but they cannot yield accurate predictions at more local levels. One response has been to use a consensus method—that is, to use a variety of SDMs (e.g., generalized additive models, generalized linear models, bioclimatic envelope models, maximum entropy, boosted regression trees) and view the region of overlap of their predictions as the predicted ultimate distribution (Bertelsmeier et al. 2015). However, the various methods all come with assumptions and limitations, and they tend to share certain shortcomings including the failure to account for genetic variation, difficulty in accommodating data on coexisting species, difficulty in dealing with the frequent absence of absence data, and absence in the native range of certain combinations of environmental features accessible in the introduced range (Jeschke and Strayer 2008, Merow et al. 2014a). It is thus unclear that a consensus of similarly limited models substantially increases prediction accuracy. A promising approach to predicting eventual range of an invasive species is a mechanistic one, based directly on experiments on the physiology and life history of the species in question. Physiological and trait-based mechanisms have been used to predict species' range shifts and new ecological interactions within the broader field of global change biology (Sorte et al. 2010). However, these approaches have seen little use within invasion science, although an illustrative example comes from Chapman et al. (2014), who predicted the nonnative range of ragweed based on its observed response to temperature and day length. Such experiments are often time-consuming and require detailed knowledge of the species in question, which is probably the main reason their use is minimal in comparison with use of SDMs; in fact, physiological aspects of invasions are generally not often invoked (Lennox et al. 2015), probably for the same reason. Several researchers have suggested shortcuts, in which one does not study the precise physiological mechanism(s) underpinning a range limit or population size, but a shortcut is employed entailing a response of the organism that integrates physiological responses, such as knockdown times (Jørgensen et al. 2019) or thermal performance curves (Sinclair et al. 2016). Judicious use of such a mechanistic approach can yield a much more accurate prediction of the likelihood of an invasion at a smaller scale than an SDM. In addition, an SDM can be combined with mechanistic research to elucidate aspects of the ecology and evolution of invasive species, as with the demonstration of a niche shift in the new range of an invasive mite (Hill et al. 2013). Mechanistic modeling of invasive species' geographical range dynamics can also be readily combined with demographic data to generate integral projection models that are likely to yield more accurate and more detailed, small-scale predictions than SDMs alone (Merow et al. 2014b, Behrens et al. 2017). Interaction between the many users of SDMs and scientists producing mechanistic models using physiological and demographic data is rare, although such an interaction could potentially be of great use in validating SDM predictions and especially fine-tuning them to more local scales. Probably the dearth of such collaborations, and related scientific products, arises because scientists employing the different approaches publish in different journals, go to different meetings, do not interact substantially on other projects, and have not often considered the possible benefits of such collaborations. We asked how SDM/ENM approaches in invasion ecology can motivate and be integrated with physiological research to provide a mechanistic understanding of the projected spread and limits of invasive species. The ecological impacts of invasive species on native populations, communities, and ecosystems are one of the principal motivations behind studying nonnative species (Ricciardi et al. 2013, 2017). Yet, when, where, and how such impacts occur has at times proven difficult to establish. One reason for this difficulty is that when invasive species interact with other organisms and the environment, the subsequent impacts of those interactions likely vary over large spatial scales, but this variation is rarely measured. Instead, results from a few sites or a single region are often extrapolated across multiple regions, a continent, or even globally. Likewise, environmental change is currently altering climatic regimes and species are experiencing new environmental conditions in situ and responding variably over time according to prevalent local conditions. Another challenge is the perception that impacts can most usefully be measured as declines in native species' populations or loss of native species from local ecosystems. However, several or even most impacts are likely mediated through physiological mechanisms such as stress responses to perceived predation threats by invasive predators (Preisser and Bolnick 2008), reductions in food resources in the presence of invasive competitors (Lennox et al. 2015), and changes in energetic demands triggered by invasion-mediated alterations of an organism's physical environment (increased shade, denser vegetation, increasing salinity; e.g., Funk 2013, Mozdzer and Caplan 2018). These stress responses precede population declines in many instances, potentially providing a way to assess the impacts of invasive species mechanistically across multiple spatial and biological scales, and such responses may also provide an opportunity for managers to preemptively intervene and avoid negative impacts. The effects on physiology of change-related stressors, such as drought and increasing salinity, are also likely to vary both between and within species depending on intraspecific variation and the effects of stressors on competition and functional traits (Bertness and Callaway 1994, Johnson et al. 2008, De Frenne et al. 2014). Other unanswered questions include how novel interactions will influence invasive species physiology over space and time (Franklin et al. 2016) and whether intraspecific genetic variation at the population level in plant physiological tolerances will allow invaders to persist under the stresses of environmental change (Suda et al. 2015). For example, L. A. Meyerson et al. (unpublished manuscript) found that intraspecific genome size variation mediated plant stress tolerance via plasticity for invasive but not native Phragmites australis. Knowledge of impacts at the level of individual physiology provides a useful mechanistic basis for how impacts are produced, including how those impacts will vary across spatial environmental gradients and longer time frames. During the workshop, we explored questions related to the scale dependence of invasive species impacts, including how physiological processes mediate invasive species' ecological impacts and how these processes are influenced by spatial and temporal variability (including native and introduced ranges). We also sought to develop a framework for prediction to better inform invasion risk assessment and management, including assessing trait dissimilarity between native and invasive species as a mechanism to predict ecological impact. A central obstacle to achieving biological integration relative to predicting invasive species' impacts is the context-dependent nature of impacts. Context dependency is believed to result from spatial differences in biotic and abiotic conditions across locations that house an invasive species. It also results from temporally variable conditions within any one of these locations, or the changing abundance or phenotype of the invader itself. Prediction is difficult under context dependency as it suggests that it is unlikely that a single set of factors can be reliably used to characterize invasive species impact. The need for prediction, especially at management-relevant spatial scales, is thus acute. There have been consistent calls in the literature and as a part of various environmental summits to create invasive species impact databases (Olenin et al. 2014), with several efforts coming to fruition. These efforts to rank invasive species impacts provide some measure of information on the likely impacts of an invasive species within local environments (e.g., national parks, watersheds, estuaries), but the information available for such rankings is not granular enough in detail to produce impact predictions at smaller spatial scales. This issue leaves land managers, resource agencies, and policymakers with the dilemma of how to prioritize detection, control, and management of the increasing numbers of invasive species delivered to their doorstep each year via global trade. We sought to synthesize into a single framework existing approaches to generating context-specific predictions, and then to assess the needs, sources, and availability of the data required to for this framework to be useful. There is an enormous value sitting within existing data that can be used in this context; however, there are data availability gaps and a dearth of open-access data transformation workflows that move these data from raw to relevant. A primary objective for the workshop was to provide an overview of the availability of such data, illustrating where data gaps may be filled by strategic investment in empirical data gathering, better structuring of existing data warehousing, increasing accessibility of existing data sources, and developing data transformation technologies for use in invasive species impact predictions. Very few existing data sources allow for the collection, validation, and collation of formal and informal observations on the ecological impacts of invasive species at all locations across their geographical range and through time (c.f., Narščius et al. 2012). The ability of a database to accumulate observations of both invasive species occurrences and observed impacts is essential to its usefulness in allowing users to test integrative hypotheses about range expansion and impact. Spread and impact are not temporally or spatially static invasion phenomena but are instead emergent outcomes of how organisms respond to the range of environmental conditions they encounter. To capture these local-scale differences, a database on invasive species must be informed by local-scale moment-in-time observations and experiments and updated frequently with new observations of the same species across multiple locations, and with information on the same species at the same locations collected over time. Such a data framework will necessitate formalizing measurements of ecological impacts but will also involve full integration with existing data sources on species' occurrence (native and invasive), taxonomic identity, and climatic and environmental conditions. Participants are currently developing a comprehensive overview of the need for such a data repository, the feasibility of integrating such data within existing databases, and the currently unmet challenges facing development of such a database. Because the workshop included scientists with diverse expertise and perspectives that span biological realms, taxa, and disciplinary backgrounds, we anticipate innovative outcomes that may help to shape the future of invasion research. As a group, we hope to reach a wide audience of researchers and policymakers by exploring the intersection between eco-physiology and invasion biology, especially relative to how an interdisciplinary approach can inform fundamental questions about invasive species spread and impact; by developing SDM/ENM approaches in invasion science that can motivate and be integrated with physiological research to provide a mechanistic understanding of likely spread and limits of invasive species; by highlighting understudied mechanisms of invasions, such as physiological response impacts over multiple spatial and temporal scales under environmental change; and developing an eco-informatics statement-of-need paper aimed at state and federal agencies with invasive species mandates. In all of our subsequent efforts, we aim to provide context across large spatial scales (differing impacts of different species over space, impacts changing over time) to guide more effective and efficient management strategies.

Many eukaryotic gene products elicit remarkable functional diversity, even those involved in basic cellular processes. In particular, increasing evidence indicates that a number of ribosomal proteins fulfill a second function apart from ribosome and protein synthesis (1Wool I.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 164-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Ribosome biogenesis takes place in the nucleolus where rDNA is transcribed in a large precursor RNA which is then processed by nucleotide modifications and specific cleavages into mature rRNAs that eventually assemble with ribosomal proteins into ribosomal subunits (2Mélèse T. Xue Z. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar,3Shaw P.J. Jordan E.G. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 93-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). This process requires a number of additional factors, such as small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA) 1The abbreviations used are: snoRNA, small nucleolar RNAs; RRM, RNA Recognition Motif; PEV, Position Effect Variegation; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SELEX, selection-amplification procedure; NS, non-selected sequence; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and non-ribosomal nucleolar proteins. Our knowledge of nucleolar proteins is limited. However, a shared structural feature is the presence of modules thought to represent functional domains (3Shaw P.J. Jordan E.G. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 93-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Such modules include basic and acidic stretches, which possibly interact with ribosomal proteins (4Xue Z. Mélèse T. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 414-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and the so-called RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) (5Nagai K. Oubridge C. Jessen T.H. Li J. Evans P.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), which could bind either rRNAs at different stages of maturation or snoRNAs. Ribosome biogenesis is tightly regulated in a close relationship with cell growth or differentiation. It has long been shown that changing cell culture conditions in a way that either improves the growth rate or induces a differentiation program results in enhancedversus decreased ribosome biosynthesis, respectively (6Nomura M. Sci. Am. 1984; 250: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutations that disrupt gene functions necessary for ribosome assembly often result in growth defects. In yeast or mammalian cell lines, requirement for cell growth has been demonstrated for several snoRNAs (7Maxwell E.S. Fournier M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 35: 897-934Crossref Scopus (545) Google Scholar) and for all the components of RNase MRP, the best characterized snoRNP (8Tollervey D. Kiss T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, several classes of mutations cause growth alteration during development, such as theMinute class (9Lindsley D.T. Zimm G.G. The Genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1992: 433-441Google Scholar), widely believed to affect ribosomal protein genes (10Saeboe-Larssen S. Lyamouri M. Merriam J. Oksvold M.P. Lambertsson A. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1215-1224PubMed Google Scholar), and mini and bobbedmutations, which alter rRNA production (11Kay M.A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Genetics. 1987; 3: 347-351Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The Drosophila modulo gene (mod) has first been characterized as a dominant suppressor of Position Effect Variegation (PEV) (12Garzino V. Pereira A. Laurenti P. Graba Y. Levis R.W. Le Parco Y. Pradel J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4471-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PEV occurs in experimental strains where genes placed close to constitutive heterochromatin are randomly turned on or off, leading to mosaic adult structures. The products of genes that modify PEV are believed to change the local chromatin structure, which leads, when they are mutated, to an increased (suppression of variegation) or a decreased (enhancement of variegation) expression of neighboring genes (13Elgin S.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 14Henikoff S. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Wakimoto B.T.

The dominant PEV suppression phenotype of mod, therefore, suggests that its product participates in the formation of multimeric protein complexes that package the DNA, promoting chromatin compaction and inactivation (12Garzino V.

We have recently reported thatmod, apart from its role in chromatin structuration, has a second cellular function and is required in nucleolus activity and protein synthesis capacity (17Perrin L. Demakova O. Fanti L. Kallenbach S. Mal'ceva N.I. Pimpinelli S. Zhimulev I. Pradel J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2753-2761PubMed Google Scholar). First, cell clones deficient formod express phenotypic traits characteristic ofMinute mutations. Second, the protein, while actually associated to condensed chromatin and heterochromatin sites, is also abundantly found at the nucleolus. Consistent with this localization, Mod displays a modular organization which is often found in nonribosomal nucleolar proteins, including an acidic stretch, two basic regions located at both ends of the molecule, and four reiterated RRMs in the remaining core portion (18Krejci E. Garzino V. Mary C. Bennani N. Pradel J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8101-8115Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Birney E. Kumar S. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5803-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The goal of the investigation reported here was to gain insight into the nucleic acid interactions established by Mod at the nucleolus and chromatin and to determine the molecular mechanism that controls the distribution and balances the function of the protein in the two sub-nuclear compartments. The data show that the two basic domains independently contact DNA without sequence specificity, whereas RRMs provides a sequence-specific RNA-binding activity. We also report that nucleolar Mod is phosphorylated and associated to an RNA moiety, whereas the chromatin-bound Mod appears to be unmodified. A functional scheme is finally proposed in which modification by phosphorylation modulates Mod subnuclear distribution and balances its function at the nucleolus and chromatin. Primers used to generate by polymerase chain reaction sequences encoding the Mod variants were: 1) ACGTGGATCCGCCCAAAAGAAAGCCGTCACCG; 2) ACGTGGATCCGGCCGTATTTATGGTACTACGCAA; 3) ACGTGGATCCGAAGTGCCGCAGTTCAGTGAAGA; 4) ACGTGGATCCTCAGTTTGGCTCAATAAATATAGGGGC; and 5) ACGTGGATCCTGAAGAAGCGCCTGTAGAGAAGCC. Primers pairs (1+2), (2+3), (1+4), (3+4), and (4+5) were used to produce full-length Mod, the protein variants truncated from one or the two basic domains located at the N and C termini and RRMs, respectively. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were produced fromBamHI-digested polymerase chain reaction products cloned in pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), purified according to Smith and Johnson (20Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar) and stored at −20 °C in NT2 buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5). For SDS-PAGE, proteins were fractionated on 7.5% gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. Bidimensional gel analysis was performed as described in (21O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins from embryos (0–18 h) were treated (30 μg) in isoelectric focusing buffer (Biolyt, pH 3.0 and pH 10, from Bio-Rad). After SDS-PAGE in the second dimension and electrotransfer, Mod was revealed with anti-Mod monoclonal antibody (mAb) LA9 and anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Promega). Schneider cells nuclei were isolated according to Bellaiche et al. (22Bellaiche Y. Bandyopadhyay R. Desplan C. Dostatni N. Development. 1996; 122: 3499-3508PubMed Google Scholar), resuspended in 30 μl/106 cells of cold RSB buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 800 unit RNasin/ml, mixture of protease inhibitors, pH 7.4), sonicated on ice 2 × 5 s and centrifuged at 4 °C first at 14,000 × g for 10 min and then at 105 × g for 1 h. Samples (20 μl) of the resulting extract were preincubated for 20 min at 37 °C, run on native 3–20% polyacrylamide gels in Tris-glycine, pH 8.3, and transferred on nitrocellulose in carbonate buffer (10 mm NaHCO3/Na2CO3-NaOH, pH 9.8). When indicated, samples were supplemented during the preincubation at 37 °C with M12 or non-selected sequence (NS) RNAs (at final concentration ranging from 50 ng/ml to 1 μg/ml) or with RNase A (5 μg/ml). Interactions between32P-end-labeled RNA (1 ng) and protein were performed for 15 min at 20 °C in 20 μl final of 20 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mg/ml tRNA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.8% VRC, RNasin (400 units/ml), 5% glycerol, pH 7.4. RNA protein complexes were revealed by autoradiography after 8% PAGE (20 mA) at 4 °C under non-denaturing conditions (5% glycerol, 0.5 × Tris-borate-EDTA). K d values were established from quantification at the phosphoimager in serial experiments with increasing protein concentration and constant probe amount. Isolation and fractionation of nuclei were carried out as described previously (23Garzino V. Moretti C. Pradel J. Biol. Cell. 1987; 61: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei, purified under conditions that prevent loss of nuclear material, were successively extracted in 0.15 and 0.3 m NaCl, and chromatin fragments were solubilized by sonication in 0.45 m NaCl. Western analysis of the recovered fractions was performed with a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against chromatin-bound proteins like histone 2B, nucleosoluble components (S5 and P11 antigens), and Mod (17Perrin L. Demakova O. Fanti L. Kallenbach S. Mal'ceva N.I. Pimpinelli S. Zhimulev I. Pradel J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2753-2761PubMed Google Scholar, 23Garzino V. Moretti C. Pradel J. Biol. Cell. 1987; 61: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The Mod protein was detected in 0.15 m and 0.30–0.45 m NaCl fractions only. For Mod immunoprecipitation assays, sub-nuclear fractions were prepared from either 1 g of dechorionated embryos or 108 KC cells, diluted in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15m, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5) supplied with a mixture of protease inhibitors and preincubated for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Depleted samples (1 ml) were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the same buffer with 10 mg of protein A-Sepharose saturated with an excess mAb LA9 (1.6 mg of IgG purified from ascitic fluid for 100 mg of protein A-Sepharose beads). Beads were washed three times in 10 mmTris-HCl, 0.5 m LiCl, 0.1% SDS, 2% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4, then in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was prepared for SDS-PAGE. KC cells were exponentially grown in D22 medium, centrifuged, and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C in HN buffer (50 mm Hepes, 0.15m NaCl, pH 7.6) at a density of 106 cells/ml. After centrifugation, cells were incubated again, 3 h at 25 °C and 108 cells/ml, in HN buffer supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1.8 mm glucose, 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate, and, except when specified, with 10% fetal calf serum. Nuclei were purified and fractionated as described previously (23Garzino V. Moretti C. Pradel J. Biol. Cell. 1987; 61: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) but in the presence of an excess of sodium pyrophosphate (10 mm) and of phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1 m sodium fluorure, 20 mm EDTA, and 20 mm EGTA). Mod immunoprecipitation was also performed in the presence of sodium pyrophosphate and phosphatase inhibitors. Purified GST fusion proteins (5 μg) were added to dsDNA-cellulose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 0.5 ml in NT2 buffer supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and incubated at 20 °C for 2.5 h. After centrifugation and three washes in NT2 (0.5 ml each), bound proteins were stepwise eluted from the beads with 0.5 ml of NT2 containing increasing amounts of NaCl. Fractions, including the three washes, were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and analyzed by Western blotting. For embryonic Mod, nuclei were isolated and fractionated as described previously (24Tsai D.E. Harper D.S. Keene J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4931-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). DNA binding assays were performed using 85 and 250 μg of nucleosoluble and chromatin-bound proteins, respectively. We used the synthetic RNA pool first described in Tsai et al. (24Tsai D.E. Harper D.S. Keene J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4931-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). SELEX procedure was essentially as described in Ghisolfi-Nieto et al. (25Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Purified GST fusion proteins (5 μg) were incubated with 20 μl of 50% glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 4 °C in NT2 buffer (100 μl final volume). After three washes in 0.5 ml of NT2 buffer, beads were suspended in 50 μl of binding buffer (20 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2.5% polyvinyl alcohol, 1 mm EGTA, 100 μg/ml tRNA, 125 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.8%, pH 7.4) and incubated with the RNA sample (0.5 μg) for 5 min at 20 °C. For the first two rounds, RNA samples were preincubated for 5 min at 20 °C with Sepharose beads without protein prior to the selection step. After the third round, 0.5 m urea was added in the last wash. Polymerase chain reaction products were cloned and sequenced after seven rounds of selection/amplification. RNAs were transcribedin vitro by T7 RNA polymerase, 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, purified on a 10% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel, eluted overnight, and precipitated with ethanol. Labeled RNA (50,000 cpm) was renatured in reaction buffer at 37 °C for 15 min and complex formation carried out at 20 °C for 15 min in the presence of increasing amounts of Mod. Enzymatic cleavage reactions by RNase T1 (10−2 unit), RNase V1 (0.2 unit), RNase T2 (0.2 unit), or nuclease NC (0.2 unit) were performed at 20 °C for 5 min in 10 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 μg of carrier tRNA, pH 7.5. Iron-EDTA reactions were done as in (26Lentzen G. Moine H. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Wintermeyer W. RNA. 1996; 2: 244-253PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by phenol/chloroform extraction, and RNA fragments recovered by ethanol precipitation were analyzed on 20% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels. RNase T1 and alkaline ladders served for cleavage site assignments. RNase A salivary gland treatment was as in Richter et al. (27Richter L. Bone J.R. Kuroda M.I. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, salivary glands were preincubated for 2 min in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100, and then for 8 min in either phosphate-buffered saline alone (as a control) or phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml RNase A. Polytene chromosome squashes and staining were performed as described in Clarket al. (28Clark R.F. Wagner C.R. Craig C.A. Elgin S.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 203-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Mod was detected by the mAb LA9 at 20 μg/ml and Maleless (Mle) by affinity purified rabbit anti-Mle antibodies (gift of M. Kuroda) at a dilution of 1/500. Anti-mouse-fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated and anti rabbit-tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson) were used at a dilution of 1/150. Slides were examined under an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss). Mod has been previously shown to bind DNA bothin vitro and in vivo (12Garzino V. Pereira A. Laurenti P. Graba Y. Levis R.W. Le Parco Y. Pradel J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4471-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Krejci E. Garzino V. Mary C. Bennani N. Pradel J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8101-8115Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cross-linking/immunoprecipitation experiments moreover demonstrated interaction with several repetitive elements, consistent with the protein association to heterochromatin and the dominant phenotype of PEV suppression (17Perrin L. Demakova O. Fanti L. Kallenbach S. Mal'ceva N.I. Pimpinelli S. Zhimulev I. Pradel J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2753-2761PubMed Google Scholar). In order to identify the domains in Mod involved in DNA binding, GST fusions of various truncated versions of the protein were tested on dsDNA-cellulose chromatography. The results showed that the deletion of the two positively charged N- and C-terminal domains is required to abolish the ability of Mod to bind DNA in this assay, whereas truncated mutant proteins of only one of these domains still exhibit some activity (not shown). We further develop SELECT experiments (29Oliphant A.R. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2944-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) to ask the question of sequence specificity in Mod DNA binding. No obvious consensual motif was revealed by sequence comparison of 40 clones obtained after five rounds of selection/amplification performed using the full-length protein. Thus, the two terminal domains in Mod likely interact with DNA without sequence specificity. The Mod sequence contains a number of putative phosphorylation sites (18Krejci E. Garzino V. Mary C. Bennani N. Pradel J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8101-8115Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Metabolic incorporation of32P in KC cells, followed by immunoprecipitation, Western blotting and autoradiography, reveals that Mod gives rise to a single band of 78 kDa (Fig. 1 A,lane 2), indicating that the protein actually is phosphorylated in vivo. Consistently, treating Western blots with alkaline phosphatase progressively reduces and finally abolishes the 32P labeling (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3and 4). Next, by comparing the 32P incorporation in starved and serum-stimulated cells, we noticed that serum addition raised the specific incorporation in Mod by a factor of 16, whereas the increase in crude cell extracts and purified nuclei was only 2.7- or 4.7-fold, respectively (Fig. 1 B). As internal control to these experiments, we compared the Western signals from serial dilutions of cell extracts grown in the presence or absence of 10% fetal calf serum to show that the serum has no significant effect on Mod de novosynthesis (not shown). These data strongly suggest that serum enhances Mod phosphorylation. To investigate for Mod phosphorylation in vivo, protein isoelectric variants present in embryos were analyzed by dimensional PAGE followed by a Western blot analysis. Nuclear extracts were prepared either in the presence of a mixture of phosphatase inhibitors or digested with phosphatases. Mod from phosphatase-treated extracts runs as a single spot with an apparent pI of 7.2, indicating that the multiple isoforms differing by negative charges (pI from 7.2 to 5.2) observed from non-digested nuclei, correspond to stepwise phosphorylation events on several amino acid residues (Fig.1 C). We previously reported a procedure that combines stepwise salt extraction with low and high speed centrifugations, to isolate distinct subnuclear fractions from purified nuclei, and a comparative Western analysis demonstrating that nucleosoluble proteins and components firmly bound to chromatin were recovered in distinct subfractions; the former by extraction at low salt concentration (0–0.15 m and then 0.15–0.3 mNaCl) and the latter by sonication after raising NaCl concentration from 0.30 to 0.45 m (23Garzino V. Moretti C. Pradel J. Biol. Cell. 1987; 61: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Mod was detected in nucleosoluble (0–0.15 m NaCl) and chromatin (0.30–0.45 m) fractions only. Most significantly, the protein has never been seen in the intermediate salt extract (0.15–0.30 m), ruling out the possibility of a cross contamination between nucleolar and chromatin Mod fractions. This led us to conclude, when considered with immunolocalization and genetic data, that part of the protein is firmly bound to chromatin, whereas the major fraction is nucleolar and solubilized at low salt (17Perrin L. Demakova O. Fanti L. Kallenbach S. Mal'ceva N.I. Pimpinelli S. Zhimulev I. Pradel J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2753-2761PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether this differential distribution could be related to different phosphorylation states of the protein, we analyzed 32P incorporation in Mod from sub-nuclear fractions. The protein was immunoprecipitated from chromatin and nucleosoluble fractions of metabolically labeled KC cells and revealed by Western blotting and autoradiography. As shown in Fig.2 A, nucleosoluble Mod is highly labeled, whereas the chromatin-bound protein does not have detectably incorporated radioactive phosphates. These data suggest that Mod is present in two different states in the nucleus: the nucleolar population is phosphorylated, whereas its chromatin-bound counterpart is not or is poorly phosphorylated. These data also suggested the hypothesis that phosphorylation could control Mod DNA-binding activity. To test the hypothesis, nucleolar and chromatin fractions prepared from embryos were assayed on dsDNA-cellulose chromatography. Data in Fig.2 B indicate that Mod extracted from chromatin strongly binds DNA and is eluted at NaCl concentrations of 0.5–1.0 m, whereas the nucleosoluble protein shows significantly weaker affinity and is eluted at NaCl concentrations of 0.2–0.3 m. Significantly, Mod from a nucleolar extract digested by phosphatase exhibits a substantially improved DNA-binding activity (elution at NaCl concentrations of 0.3–1.0 m). We therefore conclude that phosphorylation likely down-regulates Mod DNA-binding activity in vitro. The presence of four RRMs in Mod led us to investigate the RNA binding properties of the protein. We first tested the affinity of GST-Mod or of a truncated version consisting only of the four RRMs (GST-RRM) to homopolymeric oligoribonucleotides. Both are able to bind poly(G) and poly(U), to a lesser extent poly(A), but not poly(C) (not shown). Second, we used GST-Mod and GST-RRM proteins in a selection-amplification procedure known as SELEX (30Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (8055) Google Scholar) to look for nucleotide specificity in RNA binding. PCR products were cloned and sequenced after seven rounds of selection/amplification of a 25-nucleotide-long random sequence (24Tsai D.E. Harper D.S. Keene J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4931-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Out of 43 sequences selected from the GST-Mod, 24 obey the consensus (UUAC(N)xGU(A/G)G(U/A)(M)x), where N and M are complementary nucleotides putatively able to form a stem, and “x” is comprised between 4 and 6 (Fig. 3). The other clones lack the consensus and do not efficiently bind Mod in gel shift controls (not shown). Their selection can originate from unspecific interaction with the basic terminal domains present in the full-length protein. This hypothesis is supported by the second SELEX experiment performed with GST-RRM. 10 clones from this selection were sequenced, and all were found to match with the consensus defined in Fig. 3. This experiment first confirms the consensual motif derived from the selection by GST-Mod and secondly indicates that RNA binding specificity is only provided by the RRM-containing domain. Band shift assays were performed to confirm that selected sequences actually interact with Mod fusion proteins and to get an estimate of their affinities (K d values are given in Fig. 3). M8 and M12 were found to correspond to the aptamers of highest affinity, with K d values of 25 nm for GST-Mod and of 10 nm for GST-RRM. The other selected RNAs present weaker affinities, with K d values ranging from 100 nm to 1000 nm. Fig.4 reports only the data obtained with M12 aptamer and the various controls done. The aptamer is actually shifted by GST-Mod and GST-RRM, whereas a ribonucleotide lacking the consensus (non-selected sequence, NS) does not (Fig. 4 A). Fig.4 B provides other controls showing that anti-Mod mAb LA9 inhibits the interaction (lane 2), GST alone is ineffective (lane 3), and competition with unlabeled M12 progressively abolishes the shift whereas competition with ribonucleotide NS has no effect (lanes 4–8). Taken together these data indicate that Mod is a sequence-specific RNA binding protein and support the idea that the bipartite motif defined here constitutes a high affinity site for the protein. The conformation of M12 was investigated using several enzymatic probes (31Ehresmann C. Baudin F. Mougel M. Romby P. Ebel J.P. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9109-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) such as RNase V1 (specific for paired nucleotides; Fig.5 B, lane 9), RNase T1 (specific for unpaired guanines; Fig. 5 B, lane 1), RNase T2 (preferential cut after unpaired adenines; Fig.5 B, lane 5), and nuclease from Neurospora crassa (specific for unpaired nucleotides; Fig.6 A). The results are reported on the secondary structure model derived from the enzymatic probing (Fig. 5 C). The data support the existence of a stable hairpin structure presenting an external loop (nucleotides G27–U31) and two internal loops (nucleotides A13–C21/A38–A41 and A47–A55). The external loop is well defined by the presence of an RNase T1 cut at G30 and of several RNase T2 or nuclease NC cleavages at U29 and A28 (see Fig. 5, A and B). Interestingly, G27 is not accessible to RNase T1, indicating that this peculiar guanine is either stacked within the loop or base paired with U31. Many hairpin loops closed by non-canonical base pairs (G–A or G–U) have been described (32Wyatt J.R. Tinoco J.I. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 465-496Google Scholar). In most of the selected aptamers, position U31 is predominantly U or A (see Fig. 3). Other single-stranded specific RNase cleavages are mainly located in the regions A15–U19, U48–A52, and G64–A67 (Fig. 5,A and B). The existence of helices I and II is supported by the presence of several RNase V1 cleavages at positions 9–11, 22–24, 36, 44–45, and 59",W1982827856,True,0.9305891394615173
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01938.x,Co‐infections and the third trophic level,"The proverb ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’ is axiomatic in community ecology and the study of tri-trophic interactions. This is particularly relevant for studies of plant–herbivore–parasitoid interactions. Parasitoid wasps eavesdrop on plant volatiles emitted after plants are attacked by herbivores (De Moraes et al. 1998). This facilitates host finding by parasitoids, attack by parasitoids reduces population size of herbivore hosts (Rosenheim 1998), and the plants and parasitoids each benefit by the interaction (van Loon et al. 2000). One takes for granted the observation that most plant secondary compounds likely evolved as plant defences against natural enemies, but this was formally proposed as a mechanism only 52 years ago (Frankel 1959). Similarly, plant–insect herbivore–parasitoid interactions are key to understanding plant population dynamics and community ecology, although the conceptual framework for this is also relatively new (Karban et al. 1999). A closer look at life in the tangled bank reveals highly complex ecological interactions and evolutionary outcomes among plants, insect herbivores and the third trophic level. Taking just the case of plant–insect–parasitoid interactions, one finds that most plants are attacked by many herbivore species (co-infections), which are in turn attacked by many parasitoid species, which are attacked by hyperparasitoids, and so on. When examined in detail, such interactions can be driven by complex, unimaginable mechanisms—for example, a phage virus toxin encoded in the genomes of bacterial symbionts of aphids renders hosts resistant to parasitoid wasps (Oliver et al. 2009). Such a complex (and wonderful) ecological and evolutionary milieu might be viewed as an intellectually intractable morass. For example, two herbivorous insect species using a common host plant may compete with or facilitate one another, or may not affect the other’s fitness at all—and—the direction and strength of such interactions are likely to be highly context-dependent. Can we build a robust framework for predicting the direction and strength of plant–herbivore–parasitoid interactions in real ecological communities? Advances in network theory and competition theory are likely to be helpful in understanding how such systems work from an ecological perspective, and potentially how they evolve (Chesson & Kuang 2008; Guimarães et al. 2011). But are there more fundamental traits of plants that can be leveraged to gain insight into the direction and strength of ecological interactions within these complex communities? In this issue of Functional Ecology, Soler et al. (2012) provide fresh insight into how co-infections robustly modulate plant defence signalling, and then tests whether this influences tri-trophic interactions in a natural ecological community. Widespread signalling cross talk, primarily via the three plant hormones jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene (ET), allows plants to coordinate and fine-tune their defences against the diversity of potential natural enemies. Plants deploy distinct, but often overlapping defence strategies against biotrophic microbes, phloem-feeding insects and leaf-chewing herbivores (Stout et al. 2006). Numerous studies have examined the physiological and molecular genetic basis of plant signalling and cross talk, mostly in model plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, tomato and tobacco). Herbivores and many fungi typically induce the JA pathway and many bacterial and some fungal pathogens the SA pathway, and ET seems to be modulator of cross talk between the two pathways. While extremely insightful, these studies have led to some typological thinking—that herbivores induce the JA pathway and that bacteria induce the SA pathway. This hazard is apparent when one considers that the causative agent of bacteria speck disease (the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas syringae) in plant leaves will induce either the JA pathway or the SA depending on the presence or absence of single avirulence or virulence genes (Cui et al. 2005). This indicates that it may well be difficult to make predictions about how particular natural enemies induce plant defences, and whether this scales up the trophic cascade to predators. Nonetheless, there are widespread, repeatable and ecologically relevant cross-talk phenotypes present across host plant taxa. For example, the SA pathway and JA pathway are largely mutually antagonistic in plants. How such antagonism affects the their trophic level, as well as interactions among co-infecting natural enemies is relatively unknown, but clearly likely to be extremely important ecologically and evolutionarily (Thaler 1999). Only a handful of elegant studies (e.g. (Rodriguez-Saona et al. 2005)) have examined how plant defence hormone signalling is affected by attack from multiple herbivore species, and how this translates into effects on the herbivores and their parasitoids in the third trophic level. Soler et al. (2012) provide an important step forward by studying co-infection of Brassica oleracea plants by a leaf-chewing herbivore and a phloem-feeding herbivore. The authors cast the effects of each herbivore in terms of how their influences on plant hormone defence signalling affect two specialized parasitoid species. The principle hypotheses tested are that previous or simultaneous infection of plants with one species, from one feeding guild, influences susceptibility (performance) towards species from other feeding guilds, and that this difference in performance translates up to predators in the next trophic level. The main ecological idea is that there is fine-tuning, trade-offs and constraints faced by plants when attacked by very different natural enemies. Clever experiments allowed ecological dissection of the strength and direction of ecological interactions between each player, across two feeding guilds and to the third trophic level, through the channel of plant defence signalling. Two ecologically distinct mustard-specialist herbivore species, the caterpillar Pieris brassicae and nymphs and adults of the aphid Brevicoryne brassicae were forced to either singly, doubly or sequentially attacked a single host individual. Plant defence signalling metabolic and gene expression readouts, as well as herbivore performance and parasitoids performance data, were collected and analysed in an integrative framework. Results showed, interestingly, a susceptibility phenotype in both directions during sequential and simultaneous co-infections—which the authors interpreted as ecological facilitation. Aphids were stronger inducers of susceptibility to caterpillars than caterpillars were to aphids. This was not likely to be mediated by SA–JA antagonism, because SA levels remained relatively constant throughout the experiment. An unknown mechanism is repressing JA-levels, which were significantly lower in aphid-infested plants, and likely to be causing the increase in P. brassicae performance. The nature of the elicitor or effector causing JA suppression is unknown. The performance of both parasitoids increased during co-infections, but perhaps the most intriguing finding was that although caterpillars only affected aphid development early in their life cycle, this subtle effect translated into a positive effect on aphid parasitoid performance, which was subtle at the herbivore level. This suggests that effects from herbivore co-infection on the third trophic level may be cryptic more generally. As Soler et al. (2012) rightly point out, this is the first step in dissecting how co-infections influence ecological interactions in this model ecological system. Because the host plant is closely related to the plant genetic model A. thaliana, there is promise that functional genetic studies on plant defence mechanisms mediating the phenotypes can be identified. This manuscript also provides an excellent context for re-examining assumptions and typological paradigms in this field. For example, while competition is viewed as the most common type of ecological interaction between herbivores, this study shows that for interguild interactions, co-infections are likely to lead to facilitation. The authors also show that although co-infections may directly benefit individuals from each herbivore guild, they are a boon for parasitoids. Host plants are probably getting the last laugh after all, because bigger parasitoids likely translate into higher parasitoid fitness and with it, plant fitness. Perhaps the enemy of my enemy is a plant’s friend, but what about the enemy of its enemy’s enemy?",W2121141244,True,0.9876343607902527
https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1420-9101.1999.00120.x,Individual control over reproduction: an underestimated element in the maintenance of sex?,"25) convincingly argue that combining traditional hypotheses on the maintenance of sex into a pluralistic framework provides a more plausible explanation for the enigmatic success of sexuality. By merging (1) more efficient elimination of deleterious mutations with (2) better tracking of environmental changes (often parasites) and allowing for synergism between both, 25) show that sexuality becomes much more robust against invasion by asexuality. Their approach abandons traditional attempts to find a single and sufficient explanation for sex. However, once accepting that a mixture of ingredients may be the best recipe to explain sex, we strongly suggest adding at least one more component. Here, we argue that the pluralistic approach ( 25) could be further strengthened by not concentrating solely on population-level processes, but by encompassing the important role that individuals may play. We focus on two assumptions that population geneticists often make and that are inherent to the hypotheses within the pluralistic framework, namely that offspring are produced (1) randomly and (2) without paternal care. Under these assumptions, offspring produced by a sexual female can be represented as a quality array of randomly produced progeny in a 1:1 sex ratio ( Fig. 1, bold lines). For asexuals, this distribution is compressed to a single all-female class with some small variance due to mutation (not shown). Sex is favoured when the advantage of producing few, better adapted and less mutation-loaded offspring outweighs the cost of producing males plus the cost of producing low-fitness offspring. Under random mating, high-quality sexual individuals lose most as they are likely to have relatively poorer mates, whereas low-quality individuals will benefit as they are likely to have better mates. This equalizing effect limits the benefits of sex. Distribution of offspring quality that a sexual individual can expect to produce. Bold curve: sample distribution under random mating (shape arbitrarily chosen). (A–C) Three ways in which individuals can improve offspring fitness (dashed lines): (A) by selecting better mates, (B) by obtaining help in raising offspring and (C) by differential treatment of offspring. Option A is the only one that can move the upper range of the distribution. Options B and C can improve the shape of the distribution, but only within the set range. Options B and C are also available to asexuals, but since they start out with a very narrow distribution (not shown), the scope for improvement is accordingly limited. However sex is not usually random. Sexual individuals can actively influence the quality of their progeny ( Fig. 1, dashed lines) and data from behavioural ecology suggest that they do this specifically in an attempt to capitalize on the benefits and reduce the costs of recombination. This results in a net advantage of sexuality at the population level. We suggest four processes sexual individuals have at their disposal to improve offspring quality and quantity. The first two (sexual selection and paternal care) are inherently linked since their strengths are inversely correlated ( 21). The third one is specific for animals that can reduce the cost of producing males. The fourth summarizes post-zygotic effects. Differential selection on individuals for access to mates through mate choice and competition for mates is known to be particularly strong on traits that indicate parasite resistance and/or mutation load (often measured as developmental instability) ( 11; 17). Nonrandom mating in relation to these traits gives parents the possibility of actively choosing the appropriate mate to obtain offspring with fewer mutations and/or a better genome–environment match than under random mating ( Fig. 1A; A. J. Pemberton, in preparation). For example, mammals actively choose mates of dissimilar MHC genotype and thereby increase the genetic variation in the immune response system of their offspring ( 13). Choosiness is particularly important for high-quality individuals in order to prevent their offspring from sliding back to a given population mean. The resultant assortative mating within this ‘upper class’ may force low-quality individuals to accept mates of a lower than average quality. At the population level, sexual selection has the potential to flatten the quality distribution of the progeny produced, thereby increasing exposure of deleterious mutations and enhancing the genotype–environment match in the next generation. If parent quality affects offspring number in addition to quality, sexual selection may also result in a larger skew towards fewer low-quality and more high-quality progeny. Sexual selection is ubiquitous ( 3) and takes place at all conceivable levels: from precopulatory interactions between individuals ( 2) down to post-copulatory selection through sperm and pollen competition ( 4) or cryptic female choice (Eberhard, 1995). Parents may be able to select their own gametes. In mice, mutant spermatocytes appear to be selectively eliminated during spermatogenesis ( 22). There is also growing evidence for nonrandom fusion of oocytes with sperm. For example, the combination of MHC alleles in eggs and sperm affects the fertilization efficiency ( 23; 20). In addition to MHC-dependent mate choice (review by 13) all this indicates active control over disease resistance in progeny, resulting in a better genome–environment match. Males are the main cost of sex, since the production of sons reduces a sexual population’s intrinsic growth rate by a factor two ( 16). However, this only applies when males are mere sperm donors. When they also provide resources, they can increase the number of progeny a female produces, up to the point at which they may cancel out this two-fold cost. Although both low- and high-quality offspring may benefit equally from paternal care ( Fig. 1B), it is the increased number of high-quality offspring that matters most, as it is this category that potentially enhances the spread of fitter gene combinations. In addition to support from males, a female can also receive help from her own offspring. Since helpers are not exposed to sexual selection while helping, they may be of use even if unfit for reproduction themselves, thus reducing the cost of producing low-quality offspring through sexuality. Although asexual females may cash in on male assistance in sexual populations as well, males will be under strong selection to recognize asexuals or their (all-female) broods ( 15). Refined assessment of females may already be in place since males that invest heavily in offspring will be under selection to distinguish cheating from faithful sexual females (see below). Individual control over sex allocation is well developed in haplodiploid organisms ( 26). Here the sex ratio is typically skewed towards females to reduce local mate competition between brothers ( 10). As a consequence, the cost of males is also reduced. A female-biased sex allocation is also known from many hermaphrodites (e.g. 19), and is expected when matings are rare ( 8) or when sexuality includes some selfing ( 6). Alternatively, asexuals arisen from hermaphroditic ancestors may not have shut down their male function completely, and still pay the cost of male allocation ( 24). All these mechanisms will reduce the cost of reproduction in sexuals relative to that in asexuals, making asexual modes of reproduction less likely. Parents also have post-zygotic mechanisms at their disposal to improve average offspring quality. First, by cutting investment in poor offspring, there are more resources for fitter progeny, skewing the distribution of offspring quality in favour of the fittest ( Fig. 1C). Selective abortion is a first mechanism to achieve this. There is actually evidence for higher abortion rates in humans among MHC-similar couples ( 1), suggesting that investment in offspring with a less variable (presumably less flexible) immune system is avoided. Second, young may be fed differentially after birth. Third, parents may put an upper limit on overall investment and induce competition among their progeny, which again results in quality-dependent allocation of resources. Even when parents are completely ignorant about offspring quality within a brood, less fit young may serve as food for fitter sibs. Finally, a female that reproduces repeatedly may make maternal investment in each single brood dependent on the quality of the likely father of that brood, thus economizing resource allocation over her lifetime ( 18). There appear to be many ways in which individual behaviour can increase the benefits of sex beyond the random mating expectation. Empirical data from behavioural ecology indicate that nonrandomness is strong and widespread in sexual species. 21) pointed out that the strength of sexual selection (our first point) is inversely related to the extent of paternal care (our second point). This is because males that do not offer paternal care, and can afford to spend more on attracting mates or fighting off rivals. It means that from our first two sets of mechanisms, at least one is likely to apply to any given system. It can therefore be no surprise that the mechanisms listed above have now been documented in many and diverse species groups, and are manifested at very basic levels, such as spermatogenesis or sperm–egg interactions. Moreover, they represent such direct advantages for the individual that employs them, that there must be strong selection in favour of them. The mere fact that individuals appear to base mating decisions on environmental adaptation and mutation load actually supports the pluralistic paradigm proposed by 25). Looking at what individuals do may therefore offer an alternative approach to quantify the relative importance of mutations vs. genotype–environment matches. ‘Individual quality-control’ should be seen as a magnifying glass that exposes small defects in potential sexual partners. Importantly, it anticipates natural selection by parasites or mutations by stressing and unveiling unfavourable genotypes before they enter the next generation. As a result, sexual populations may actually be much fitter (and evolving faster) than expected under random mating, and the advantage asexuals need to compete with sexuals should accordingly be higher. For all these reasons, we think that ‘individual quality-control’ deserves a central place in a pluralistic theory of sex. One cautionary note should be added at this point. Sexual reproduction results in a number of conflicts during reproduction because the parties, parents and offspring, are not genetically identical. These conflicts may reduce the efficiency of the mechanisms we propose. For instance, offspring may attempt to deceive their parents into believing that they are actually the best or most needy of food. But here selection for honest signals in progeny could reduce the risk. Similarly, the work on conflicts between males and females regarding certainty of paternity and paternal care ( 12) takes on a new light in this context. In these cases of conflict, the extent to which females can deceive males will be directly related to the degree to which sexual selection and paternal care act in unison. However, when males win, as is the case with paternally imprinted genes ( 9), the cost of sex can actually be higher. Note that co-operative behaviour and offspring selection are two mechanisms that asexuals also have at their disposal to improve their reproductive success ( 5; 14). Yet, the potential advantage may be much smaller. First, in co-operative asexuals resources are primarily needed to produce own eggs and helping will be reduced to providing access to common resources or sharing common tasks such as alertness or defence. A helping male, on the other hand, does not invest in eggs, and will be able to provide his female not only with services, but also with resources that may allow her to produce more offspring. Second, genetic variance among asexual offspring is so limited that the maximum benefit of offspring screening is accordingly narrow for an asexual female. Although most theoretical studies of the evolution of sexuality have actually acknowledged that nonrandom mating or parental care may influence the outcome of their models, the importance of these phenomena has always been minimized. We hope that pluralism at the population level will also lead to open-mindedness about the constituent individuals. We would specifically like to thank the invited speakers and participants that attended the Summer School on the Evolution of Sex in Seewiesen (1997) for stimulating discussions.

https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2421005122,Keystone predator and keystone intransitivity and the rescue of a competitively subdominant species,"Two significant complications in the structure of ecological communities are its dimensionality (many species interacting) and its network diversity (many ways to “wire” the interactions). Two classic concepts, the competitive exclusion principle and the keystone predator hypothesis, may frequently be embedded elements within that community structure and partially responsible for generating it. Other less-venerable concepts may be involved. In particular, for the current work, a keystone intransitivity and a behavioral higher-order effect are involved. We employ a strategic intersection of several particular network modalities—competitive hierarchy, keystone predator, keystone intransitivity, and higher-order trait-mediated effect—to examine the population dynamics of a real system, exploring the nature of its persistence (or extinction) based on the qualitative nature of its network structure. Because two of the dynamic structures, predation and intransitive competition, are both fundamentally oscillatory, the theoretical framework of coupled oscillators comes into play, a mathematical structure well known to be a major source of chaos. We use a set of natural history observations and measurements of a five-dimensional system, common in the coffee agroecosystems of Puerto Rico, to show how the unexpected persistence of a subdominant competitor in a competitive hierarchy may be contingent on a particular wiring of the system. It is notable that all five species are non-native and all are involved in a complex system of potential biological control of two significant pests.",W4413107561,True,0.9939861297607422
https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.14974,"Introduction: Special issue on species interactions, ecological networks and community dynamics – Untangling the entangled bank using molecular techniques","""It is interesting to contemplate a tangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us."" (Darwin, 1859) In the last paragraph of the Origin of Species, Darwin (1859) marvels at the diversity of life forms, the complexity of links between them and the forces creating this ""tangled bank."" In this text, we may see the origins of community ecology—today defined as ""the study of the interactions that determine the distribution and abundance of organisms"" (Krebs, 2009). To capture and quantify the key elements of this concept of community structure, we may conveniently describe communities as ecological networks (Hagen et al., 2012). In such networks, the nodes are formed by species (or other taxonomic units) and the links by their interactions (Gravel et al., 2018). Modern molecular methods offer unique opportunities for describing both elements of community structure (Roslin & Majaneva, 2016) and how they change in time and space (""community dynamics""). The last few years have seen a revolution in both sampling and sequencing technologies. For this reason, it is time to provide a sequel to the seminal Special Issue on the ""Molecular Detection of Trophic Interactions"" edited five years ago by Symondson and Harwood (2014). Building on the previous Special Issue, the current one continues the quest of ""Unpicking the Tangled Bank"" (Symondson & Harwood, 2014). Yet, where the previous compilation focused on a specific type of ecological interactions (i.e., species feeding on each other), here we have endeavoured to provide a wider community and ecosystem relevant focus. Thus, the Special Issue of 2014 was prepared by attendees at a meeting on Molecular Detection of Trophic Interactions, but the current issue reflects the collaboration between this audience and ecologists with a wider interest in ecological networks—regardless of the tools applied. Hence, the current volume is the result of synergistic back-to-back events organized at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, in September 2017: the 3rd Symposium on Molecular Detection of Trophic Interactions and the 3rd Symposium on Ecological Networks, enhanced via further networking. Many of the papers included in this volume were presented at one of these meetings, but others were added later to increase the scope and breadth of the Special Issue. The resulting issue offers a suite of studies applying molecular tools to resolving questions focused on ecological interaction networks and their dynamics. The papers included also comprise studies offering broad-ranging technical solutions for dealing with large and diverse communities, as well as reviews and summaries identifying the limits and caveats associated with quantifying community and interaction structure by molecular means. When including research with a methodological focus, we have carefully looked for particularly important and impactful studies, where the results clearly transcend the specific system studied, that is, where the methodological improvements achieved are likely to be useful for a wider range of future studies. In all other papers included in the Special Issue, the focus is on the ecology. In other words, these works deliver significant ecological findings obtained by molecular approaches. By including a blend of papers studying multiple types of interactions, taxa and realms (both aquatic and terrestrial), we hope to provide, in a single issue of Molecular Ecology, a comprehensive glimpse of the state of the art in this rapidly developing field. In particular, we hope that this issue will serve as a stimulus and catalyst for ecologists contemplating the use of molecular tools for community dissection (see also Bohan et al., 2017). Individual papers reveal how molecular tools are being fruitfully applied to many types of nodes and links, and the many types of networks formed from such elements. As an arguably thought-provoking perspective, they also show molecular techniques can be applied to describe full communities rather than their parts simultaneously—that is, to resolve multiple types of links among multiple kingdoms of taxa (Clare et al., 2019), thus opening new vistas on ""networks of networks."" Out of necessity, such initiatives so far have had to be built from multiple data sources (Pocock, Evans, & Memmott, 2012; Wirta et al., 2015). In terms of the types of interactions addressed, this Special Issue shows how molecular techniques can be applied to resolving mutualistic interactions such as pollen transport (Bell et al., 2019; Tiusanen et al., 2019) and seed dispersal (González-Varo et al., 2019), antagonistic interactions including predator–prey interactions (Deagle et al., 2019; Eitzinger et al., 2019; Mata et al., 2019; Sint, Kaufmann, Mayer, & Traugott, 2019; Verschut, Strandmark, Esparza-Salas, & Hambäck 2019 Walters et al., 2019), predator–prey-and-detritus interactions (Siegenthaler, Wangensteen, Benvenuto, Campos, & Mariani, 2019), host–parasitoid interactions (Gariepy et al., 2019; Kitson et al., 2019), host–symbiont interactions (Doña, Proctor, et al., 2019; Doña, Serrano, Mironov, Montesinos-Navarro, & Jovani, 2019), plant–herbivore interactions (Bhattacharyya, Dawson, Hipperson, & Ishtiaq, 2019), plant–fungus interactions (Schröter et al., 2019; Sepp et al., 2019), plant–prey interactions (Littlefair, Zander, de Sena Costa, & Clare, 2019), fungus–fungivore interactions (Koskinen et al., 2019) and multifaceted interactions (Clare et al., 2019). As a specific insight, the study by Doña, Proctor, et al. (2019) reveals how the application of molecular tools can even force us to re-evaluate previous concepts of the type of specific interactions. Using evidence from both light microscopy and metabarcoding, these authors show that vane-dwelling feather mites share a commensalistic–mutualistic association with their bird hosts, by feeding on fungi, microbes and detritus in the plumage. In fact, the authors find no evidence of feather mites feeding upon bird resources such as blood or skin. Consequently, the mites are recast as commensal organisms likely causing no harm but offering clear benefits to their hosts. Emphasizing the message from previous reviews (from Symondson & Harwood, 2014 to Roslin & Majaneva, 2016), the featured case studies also reveal just how much power molecular tools add by resolving ""hidden"" and hard-to-observe ecological interactions (Wirta et al., 2014). By allowing us to pinpoint associations between organisms which liquefy their prey (Eitzinger et al., 2019; Littlefair et al., 2019; Sint et al., 2019; Verschut, Strandmark, Esparza-Salas, & Hambäck 2019), hide within their hosts (Gariepy et al., 2019; Kitson et al., 2019), lack all diagnostic characters as larvae (Gariepy et al., 2019; Kitson et al., 2019; Koskinen et al., 2019), hunt at night (Mata et al., 2019) or are simply too small and similar to describe by any other means (Jones & Hallin, 2019; Walters et al., 2019), they reveal new aspects of community organization. Importantly, this is not a question of adding fine nuance to main colour, but of repainting the whole picture. Since these types of interactions form the majority of all interactions on the globe, they will profoundly affect our understanding of not only specific communities (Wirta et al., 2014), but of how communities in general are assembled and work. The findings regarding particular interactions range from insight into emergent features such as levels of specialization in ecological interaction networks (Clare et al., 2019; Doña, Proctor, et al., 2019; Doña, Serrano, et al., 2019; Koskinen et al., 2019; Sepp et al., 2019) to the role of individual seed dispersers in seed dispersal networks. As a case in point, González-Varo, Arroyo, and Jordano (2019) are able to show how much of an ecological function (seed dispersal) is concentrated to particular species at particular points in time. Migratory bird species may only be passing through an area, but still be main agents of seed dispersal for particular plants. This emphasizes the need for resolving variation in network structure through time, for which molecular techniques are ideally placed (González-Varo et al., 2019). In a similar vein, molecular diet analysis sheds new light on the trophic position of individual species within larger communities and interaction networks. Siegenthaler et al. (2019) use metabarcoding of gut contents to establish the diet of the brown shrimp, Crangon crangon, in six European estuaries. The species turns out to be an extreme generalist, feeding on hundreds of taxa, with its overall diet dominated by crustaceans, polychaetes and fish. Substantial variation in diet at both regional and local scales adds to the impression of extreme flexibility in this common species (Siegenthaler et al., 2019), but also reveals the potential for bottom-dwelling marine generalists to harvest the ""environmental DNA"" (Bohmann et al., 2014; Creer et al., 2016; Deiner et al., 2017) signal of broader fish communities for biomonitoring purposes. Where Siegenthaler et al. (2019) use molecular techniques to identify what the shrimp feeds on, Tiusanen et al., (2019) apply them to the opposite task of identifying which arthropods visit the flowers of several arctic Dryas species (all known as mountain avens). Targeting multiple sites around the Arctic, they too find an astonishing taxonomic range and richness, in this case of literally thousands of arthropod species sharing this common floral resource. Resolving such taxonomic diversity across large scales would be next to impossible with morphology-based identification approaches. Much of community ecology to date has assumed that each particular interaction is a fixed feature: If two species interact at one point in space, then they are expected to do so wherever they meet. However, recent research forces us to revisit this assumption, and add emphasis on just why interactions vary (Gravel et al., 2018; Pellissier et al., 2017; Poisot, Stouffer, & Gravel, 2015). Two papers in this issue show how molecular tools can reveal where, and under what circumstances, specific interactions occur. Bhattacharyya et al. (2019) analyse the plant contents of faecal pellets of Royle's pika (Ochotona roylei), a lagomorph endemic to the Himalayas. They show how the diet of the pika varies with elevation and with habitat structure, likely reflecting constraints and preferences during foraging (Bhattacharyya et al., 2019). Eitzinger et al. (2019) focus on a very different predator, the wolf spider Pardosa glacialis in the High Arctic. By describing the communities of both available and consumed prey along an elevational gradient, these authors demonstrate that spiders tend to prey on the same taxa—when available—regardless of their environment. However, the environment has a strong impact on available prey, and so the effect of current Arctic change will likely act indirectly, by changing what prey species are available, rather than directly modifying what is preferred (Eitzinger et al., 2019). Among predators of a different type, Littlefair et al. (2019) find an imprint of elevation on the prey community of carnivorous Sarracenia pitcher plants. Sites more different in elevation are also characterized by more different contents of the plants' pitchers. Since other studies have shown differences in free-living arthropod communities with elevation, this pattern may reflect differences in available prey rather than in realized interactions, but distinguishing between these is challenging—attesting to the need to resolve nodes and links separately in ecological interaction networks. In further evidence of the power of molecular data in resolving spatiotemporal patterning in ecological interaction networks, Jones and Hallin (2019) target communities of microbes linked by ecological function. Where nitrification pathways tend to consist of separate steps in which bacterial or archaeal communities first oxidize ammonia to nitrite, and bacterial communities then further oxidize nitrite to nitrate, little is known about how these functionally coupled organism groups co-occur in space. Here, Jones and Hallin (2019) are able to discern distinct modules of co-occurring groups of microbes associated with the two steps: Modules which occur in disparate areas are dominated by different lineages and are associated with different edaphic factors. Thus, this microbial ecology example reveals new dimensions in the structuring of ecological interaction networks: Species groups can be linked by one group preparing the metabolic substrate for another, a concept perhaps less familiar to those of us working with macroscopic taxa. Verschut et al. (2019) address how local interactions may be affected by not just one environment, but by the flow of individuals and matter between neighboring realms. Targeting terrestrial spiders living on the sea shore, these authors show how spider diets change from predominantly terrestrial prey in early summer to predominantly marine prey (non-biting midges) in late summer and autumn. Such cross-realm subsidies may prop up local population densities and expose prey to higher predator densities than if they persisted on local resources alone. The current issue shows how molecular data can reveal processes shaping communities. Tiusanen et al. (2019) study flower-visiting communities across the Arctic. By comparing patterns of phylogenetic diversity with those previously observed in plants, and by matching pairwise patterns of floristic and faunistic similarity across Arctic sites, they show that plants and arthropods have likely used similar expansion routes across the Arctic from shared refugia. This reveals a strong imprint of geological history on current patterns of community structure, beyond imprints of current climate such as precipitation and temperature (Tiusanen et al., 2019). Sint et al. (2019) describe how arthropod communities assemble once soil is exposed in front of re-treating glaciers. By revealing who feeds on what in replicate valleys of similar age, they are able to reconstruct how food webs are formed. Their findings suggest that the young food chains of glacier forelands are based on on-site processes rather than on resources blown in from other, more advanced communities. Schröter et al. (2019) compare the composition of root-associated fungi across more than a hundred temperate forest sites and find that the relative impact of different structuring forces differs across spatial scales. At local scales, forest management and tree selection have a clearer impact, but at larger scales, environmental cues and host resource traits are the most prevalent forces. From a net perspective, communities still end up very similar in terms of their trophic composition, with highly similar proportions of symbiotrophic, ectomycorrhizal, saprotrophic, endotrophic and pathotrophic fungi. Community assembly processes thus seem to secure functional resilience under the current range of climatic and edaphic conditions. Sepp et al. (2019) examine how root-colonizing fungi forming arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) are structured within a homogeneous plot of dry calcareous grassland. They find a significant imprint of host plant species, abundance and functional group on the richness and community composition of AM fungi with which they partner. Grasses host more fungal partners and appear more generalist in partner selection than do forbs. Moreover, plant species characterized by obligate rather than facultative mycorrhizal associations appear less specialized in terms of their fungal partners, as do locally more abundant plant species. Doña, Serrano, et al. (2019) take an evolutionary perspective by examining the evidence for host shifts among symbionts presumed to be highly host-specific. Building on extensive DNA metabarcoding, these authors study associations between nodes consisting of feather mite species and host bird species, finding much more variation in link structure than previously assumed. Yet, mites showed predictable fidelity in terms of host body size, and overall, the association network proved modular (i.e., some groups of bird and mite species tended to be more associated between them than with the other groups). Mites detected on unexpected hosts seemed to be there as more than just accidental tourists, with mite populations on rare hosts showing signs of both reproduction and some level of population differentiation. Overall, these patterns identify host-switching as a frequent phenomenon shaped by ecological filters such as host traits, painting a dynamic picture of the co-evolution between symbionts and their hosts. Overall, these insights regarding how communities form in space and time would be unachievable without the current molecular workflows, offering clues on both trophic position, taxonomic placement and internal relatedness. The Special Issue compiled five years ago (Symondson & Harwood, 2014) featured several papers pondering whether sequence read numbers may or may not be used to quantify the relative abundance of community members, in that case focusing on communities of prey in samples of predator diet. The papers pointed out several biases and also approaches that can adjust for them (e.g., Greenstone, Payton, Weber, & Simmons, 2014). Contributions to the current Special Issue identify the issue of what we can and cannot quantify from sequence data as a still-vibrant and partly contentious field of research. Individual papers approach this from multiple perspectives. Deagle et al. (2019) return to the issue at the heart of the previous Special Issue on dietary samples. Drawing on both critical literature analysis and simulations, Deagle et al. (2019) compare the approach of focusing on the frequency of occurrence of different food taxa across samples versus the use of relative number of sequence reads per sample. They stress that while the former approach is often advanced as more conservative than the latter, the latter may actually provide a more accurate view of population-level diet under many circumstances. Both approaches become less accurate with a higher diversity of food taxa in the samples. Bell et al. (2019) turn to mixes of pollen grains, taking an empirical approach to examining the quantitative evidence provided by controlled blends of pollen from disparate taxonomic sources. These authors demonstrate that metabarcoding is largely robust for determining pollen presence/absence, but discourage the use of sequence reads to infer relative abundance of pollen grains. Piñol, Senar, and Symondson (2019) approach related questions in silico, pointing to the fact that some experimental studies tend to report quantitative metabarcoding results, whereas similar numbers fail to do so. Hence, the question of whether metabarcoding is quantitative should actually be rephrased as when, and under what circumstances, the technique can be expected to be quantitative. They stress that ""universal primers"" will always come with more or fewer mismatches with heterogeneous sources of target template DNA, and thus focus on the number of primer–template mismatches as a metric of key interest. They show that quantitativity can be expected to vary with the primer pair used and on the characteristics of the mixture analysed, but, inspiring hope, that quantification can oftentimes be reasonably good. Lamb et al. (2019) present an empirical meta-analysis of studies published to date. Focusing on the extent to which proportions of sequence reads correspond to the original proportions of species in the community to be quantified, they find a weak quantitative relationship (slope = 0.52 ± 0.34). Yet, for a substantial fraction of studies, no quantitative relationship is detected, and neither sequencing platform type, the number of species used in a trial, or the source of DNA can account for the large variance between studies. Together, these papers point to the issue of what can, versus cannot, be inferred from sequence data as a still-vibrant and partly contentious field of research. When combined, they draw a perhaps more optimistic picture of the information value included in the read counts than contributions to the Special Issue four years ago (cf. Bell et al., 2019). Yet, each stress that for a balanced view, all sources of bias need to be considered and the methods used should be justified (Deagle et al., 2019; Piñol et al., 2019; Lamb et al., 2019). Stronger biases at particular steps of sample preparation, PCR and DNA sequencing will still blur correlations between original sample and relative sequence contents (Bell et al., 2019; Lamb et al., 2019). Using molecular tools to spot interactions between species allows us to identify potential biological control agents against invasive species. Two papers use molecular tools to scout out potential and realized enemies of invasive species. Targeting the invasive pentatomid bug Halyomorpha halys, Gariepy et al. (2019) look for links between native bugs, their parasitoids and the newcomer. Molecular analysis of egg masses reveals high parasitism rates, but the invasive species was significantly less likely to be parasitized than native confamilial species. Some parasitoid species unable to develop on the eggs of the invasive species still try to exploit them under field conditions. How this translates into parasitism in the new range is now an active field of research. Kitson et al. (2019) use nested-tagging DNA metabarcoding for exploring the parasitoid community of the oak processionary moth (Thaumetopoea processionea), an invasive species recently established in the UK. Overall, they are able to identify the main parasitoid of the late larval stages of T. processionea as Carcelia iliaca—at the same time creating the tools for describing all life stages of the oak processionary moth and the tag set needed to process massive ecological samples at the individual level. However, applications clearly do not stop at identifying the enemies of economically important species. At the community level, Hooper et al. (2019) aim to identify quantitatively dominant species in the skin microbiome of the killer whale. By describing microbial communities associated with poor and better skin health, this research may lead us to novel insights into the determinants of skin health among both larger and smaller species. All this they achieve by intensively and carefully re-analysing shotgun sequence data from hard-to-come by samples of skin biopsies of killer whales, originally taken for population genomic studies. This shows the extreme potential for extracting more biodiversity information from extant samples of rare or elusive species, even at the community level. Community ecologists tend to deal with—or at least crave for—massive data featuring both nodes and links. Perhaps, the most striking feature of the papers in this Special Issue is the large numbers involved. Here, we are not (only) referring to the high numbers of sequence reads. Sequencing power is currently increasing at a massive speed, and there is as yet no attenuation of that development in sight; quite the contrary (e.g., Loman et al., 2012). This development increases the information value generated from a single sequencing run, resulting in ever-improved resolution and precision in terms of tabulating the nodes present in the sample. Yet, equally importantly, we refer to the potential for handling and individual tagging (Kitson et al., 2019) of large numbers of samples, allowing the simultaneous characterization of massive numbers of ecological samples and taxa. In evidence of these claims, Doña, Proctor, et al. (2019) use high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and DNA metabarcoding to determine gut contents from 1,833 individual mites of 18 species inhabiting 18 bird species, whereas Doña, Serrano, et al. (2019) report findings from 25,540 individual mites (representing 64 species) from 1,130 birds (representing 71 species). Tiusanen et al. (2019) sampled 31,345 arthropods, of which they individually sequenced 13,681 individuals, detecting 1,360 barcoding BINs in the process. Schröter et al. (2019) deal with root-associated mycobiomes encompassing a total of 5,955 different operational taxonomic units across spatial scales of over 1,000 km in more than 100 temperate forest plots. Clare et al. (2019) tabulate 3,304 interactions between 762 nodes of 8 trophic functions, thus encompassing parasitic, mutualistic and predatory interactions. And the list goes on. What these figures attest to is a quantum leap in community description. By building on the tools now available for community description, we can sample very many sites in a short time, thus bypassing phenological change and other types of shift in time complicating commensurability among samples when taken sequentially rather than simultaneously. They also circumvent the taxonomic impediment by automatic species delimitation and recognition. Overall, these numbers herald a new era in community ecology, allowing us to finally view the bigger ecological picture. Together, the papers contributed to this Special Issue thus point to a fascinating development for all community ecologists: the scope for generating more relevant data in higher quantities on the key components of communities, that is, the nodes and the links of which they are built. In terms of the links, molecular data offer unrivalled benefits. Where there are multiple modes of describing the species content of a community, direct data on link occurrence are often unachievable by other means (Roslin & Majaneva, 2016). In particular, DNA metabarcoding based on nested tagging offers unique opportunities for constructing large, highly resolved species interaction networks (Kitson et al., 2019). Generation of data on species associations without rearing the organisms involved to morphologically identifiable stages bypasses both important biases and highly laborious stages of work (Kitson et al., 2019; Koskinen et al., 2019). These methods open new horizons for molecular analyses of both how communities are currently structured and how they change over time. Clare et al. (2019) point to particularly fascinating perspectives—and to particularly strong challenges ahead. What this paper proposes is this: Given that we can now delimit both nodes and links by molecular data, may we not base our full description of communities and interaction networks on such data, thus curtailing the reliance on traditional approaches? And might not such approaches prove immediate, deep insights into systems where traditional data are limited or missing, such as many tropical and/or marine environments? This is a most stimulating perspective, but also one fraught with difficulties. A key step in making sense of communities is namely to connect lists of their members with what these members are: their life cycles, size and other traits. Thus, naming a node connects it to everything that we know about what they are, what they do and how they live their lives. It is also the basis for grouping nodes into more and less similar blocks within webs, and for comparing the roles of such similar blocks among regions (e.g., ""the role of blowflies in different ecosystems""). Mapping nodes (be they defined by any criteria, morphology or DNA) onto some concept of phylogeny will significantly increase our understanding of network/community structure (Tiusanen et al., 2019), and mapping them onto known taxonomy (most papers in this Special Issue) is perhaps the easiest way to go. For each of these endeavours, we need to maintain a link between molecular barcoding, MOTUs and some aspects of traditional taxonomy (Hebert, Cywinska, & Ball, 2003; Hebert & Gregory, 2005). Whether these taxa are then named by Latin binomials or some other designations (cf. Hebert et al., 2016; Ratnasingham & Hebert, 2013) is of secondary importance, as long as we know which particular node the name refers to, and this name stays constant across community networks. Only the latter criterion will allow us to compare the role of the same node across networks (Cirtwill et al., 2018). To stress this point, we may consider contrasting scenarios. As a perhaps worst-case outcome of molecularly based food web reconstruction, we may end up dealing with unnamed MOTUs of unknown life cycle and unknown affinity to each other, with the numbers and connections between nodes varying with the similarity threshold that we use to define them and with the context of other species present in the community. Under such a scenario, molecular description of communities will contribute little insight into the ""true"" composition of the network or how it relates to other networks. But as a best-case scenario, molecular characterization of communities allows us to rapidly generate concepts of the nodes present, descriptions of who links to whom, with firm anchors in taxonomic position and what is known about the same or related species. If such approaches allow us to describe the structure of, say, a hundred replicate communities and to relate variation in their structure to, for example, variation in their functioning, then that is indeed a fantastic development. Where we are at present on the scale between these extremes is for anyone to judge, but where we should be aiming is well evident. We hope that this Special Issue showcases the true power of contemporary molecular approaches for determining ecological interactions and provides inspiration to the ecological community for the future investigation of biodiversity–ecosystem relationships.

Using our native gel technique for examining subcomplexes of the V-ATPase V1 sector, we have developed an in vitro reconstitution assay for assembly of this complex. Assembly of complex II, the soluble V1complex observed in native gels, is dependent upon the presence of divalent cations and physiological temperatures. Assembly of soluble V1 can occur in a stepwise fashion from smaller subcomplexes found in some strains deleted for V-ATPase subunits. Specifically, V1 can be assembled directly from complex III (subunits E and G) with complex IV (subunits A, B, D, and F) without prior disassembly of complex IV. The formation of complex III in vivo is also shown to be essential and could not be achievedin vitro. Assembly from simpler precursors is possible and is enhanced by added ATP. Assembly can be blocked byN-ethylmaleimide in a Vma1p (subunit A)-specific manner. From these data, we extend our previous model to consider an assembly pathway whose steps reflect the catalytic mechanism of the Boyer binding-change model.

Many enzymes are oligomeric and require the coordinated assembly of numerous individual subunits. The vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) 1The abbreviations used are: V-ATPase, vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; HA, hemagglutinin; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; ORF, open reading frame; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate. is such a multisubunit enzyme, comprised of over a dozen different proteins both in and on the membranes of vacuoles, lysosomes, tonoplasts, and related compartments (1Harvey W.R. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 1-485PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme is also found at plasma membranes in certain species and tissues. More complex than its evolutionary cousin, the F-type ATP synthase, the V-ATPase is composed of over 22 individual protein subunits that are the product of at least 12 unique genes, some of which have multiple isoforms in higher eukaryotes. Because interactions between these subunits are fundamental to both the assembly and the energy-transducing mechanism of this enzyme, we imagine that the pathway of assembly might be related to the mechanism of the enzyme. We have utilized native PAGE to reveal a myriad of partial V-ATPase complexes (Table I) found at steady state in the cytoplasm of both wild-type yeast as well as in deletion mutants of specific ATPase subunits encoded by the VMA andVPH gene families (2Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10397-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 2J. J. Tomashek, L. A. Graham, M. U. Hutchins, T. H. Stevens, and D. J. Klionsky, manuscript in preparation. In wild-type yeast, as well as strains lacking one or more integral membrane sector subunits (e.g. vma3Δ andvph1Δstv1Δ), we observe a large stable complex (II; 576 ± 96 kDa) that we believe is the soluble cytoplasmic form of V1. This complex contains at least Vma1p (A subunit), Vma2p (B subunit), Vma4p (E subunit), Vma7p (F subunit), Vma8p (D subunit), and Vma10p (G subunit), with a probable stoichiometry of A3B3DEFG. This complex is also present invma5Δ (Vma5p is the peripheral subunit C), indicating Vma5p is not necessary for assembly of the V1. In all strains except vma4Δ and vma10Δ, we observe a small complex (III; 96 ± 28 kDa) consisting of, minimally, Vma4p and Vma10p. In vma4Δ and vma10Δ, we observe an intermediate complex (IV; 317 ± 49 kDa) that contains all of the above proteins except for Vma4p and Vma10p, and invma7Δ, we observe a complex (I) of low stability that runs above complex II and is of indeterminate mass. Again, it appears to contain all of the examined subunits, except for Vma7p. Finally, in all strains except vma7Δ and vma8Δ, we observe complex VI that contains Vma7p and Vma8p.Table ISubcomplexes of the V-ATPase detected by native gel electrophoresisSubcomplexMass in kDaContains at leastFound inIND1-aND, not determined.1p, 2p, 4p, 8p, 10pvma7ΔII576 ± 961p, 2p, 4p, 7p, 8p, 10pWild type, vma3Δ, vma5Δ, vph1Δstv1ΔIII96 ± 284p, 10pAll but vma4Δ andvma10ΔIV317 ± 491p, 2p, 7p, 8pvma4Δ, vma10ΔVIND7p, 8pAll butvma7Δ and vma8Δ1-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab From these observations, we have formulated speculative models for the assembly of the V1 complex. However, these models are limited by assumptions regarding the intermediate nature of the observed complexes. We have not known if the observed complexes were intermediates trapped along a bona fide assembly pathway, or if they were products of artifactual sidetracks that resulted from the deletion of a specific subunit. In the present study, we have extended our analysis of the intermediate complexes. We demonstrate that these complexes are able to assemblein vitro to form the soluble V1 sector observed as complex II, thus indicating that they are not terminal complexes. We show that an early assembly step is ATP-dependent and that this is associated with the catalytic site of the enzyme. Finally, we show specific assembly of complex II onto isolated vacuolar membranes containing the V0 sector, indicating that complex II is capable of V0-dependent membrane association. Kinetic studies of these processes have begun to distinguish discrete steps along the assembly pathway. These results lead us to conclude that the assembly pathway of the enzyme may recapitulate the functional mechanism. All reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. HEPES buffer was from Research Organics, Inc. Media components were from Difco. All single deletion strains were based on the wild-type W303–1B (MATα leu2 his3 ade2 trp1 ura3) and were gifts from N. Nelson (Tel Aviv University). Double deletions were constructed as follows. Strainvma4Δvma7Δ was constructed starting from thevma7Δ strain (vma7::URA3) and performing a subsequent knockout of vma4::LEU2using a construct previously described (3Morano K.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2813-2824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strainvma8Δvma7Δ was constructed starting from thevma8Δ strain (vma8::URA3) and performing a subsequent knockout of vma7::LEU2using the construct in pLG13 (4Graham L.A. Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25974-25977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Knockouts were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and native PAGE analyses. Antisera have been previously described (2Tomashek J.J.

The VMA7 and VMA7HA expression plasmids were constructed as follows. Primers to VMA7, which isolated the ORF and attached a 5′-BamHI and a 3′-XhoI site, were designed and used to isolate the VMA7 ORF from YPN1VMA7 (5Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24150-24155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the VMA7HA ORF from pLG20 (4Graham L.A. Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25974-25977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction amplification. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with BamHI/XhoI and cloned into theBamHI/SalI sites of pHADR. This plasmid was constructed by excising the multiple cloning site of pRS423 (containing a HIS3 marker) and replacing it with a singleSphI site to form pRS423S. The ADH/GAL4 fusion expression cassette from pA′ (2Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10397-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was modified by deleting the GAL4 fusion portion located between two HindIII sites and replacing it with a multiple cloning site. The modified ADH expression cassette was moved into the SphI site of pRS423S to form pHADR. Both pHADR7 and pHADR7HA complemented the vma phenotype when transformed into the vma7Δ strain (data not shown). Preparation of cytosolic extracts and native gel electrophoresis have been described previously (2Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10397-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Extracts were kept on ice except during reconstitution as described in the figure legends and text. Incubations were for 10–60 min, as indicated. The following were used at these final concentrations, where indicated: metal cations (5 mm), ATP (1 mm), EDTA (10 mm), NEM (1 mm). Reconstitutions were always returned to ice before loading onto 6% native gels. Immunoblots were quantitated with Millipore BioImage software. Cells were harvested at midlog phase, washed with water, and incubated in 20 ml of 10 mm Tris-SO4, pH 9.4, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol for 20 min. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in spheroplasting buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2% glucose, 1 m sorbitol) and incubated with Zymolyase (ICN) for 30 min. Spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in 15 ml of Buffer A (10 mm MES/Tris, pH 6.9, 0.1 mmMgCl2, 12% Ficoll 400) containing 20 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (5 mg/ml each pepstatin A,l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, leupeptin, α2-macroglobulin, and 200 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were lysed at 4 °C by Dounce homogenization. The lysate was divided into ultracentrifuge tubes, overlaid with 4 ml of Buffer B (as Buffer A, but 8% Ficoll 400), and spun at 30,000 rpm for 30 min. Vacuolar membranes were collected off the top, homogenized in Buffer C (10 mmMES/Tris, pH 6.9, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA) and spun at 30,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet containing vacuole membranes was resuspended in native gel sample buffer and stored at −80 °C until needed. For membrane association experiments, thawed membranes were combined with vma3Δ cytosolic extract and incubated in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2 for 25 min at 30 °C. The membranes were pelleted at high speed in a microcentrifuge for 1.5 min, and the supernatant fraction was moved to a separate tube. Some supernatant/pellet pairs were brought up in Laemmli buffer and examined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Strains bearing disruptions in single VMAgenes assemble subcomplexes of the peripheral V1 sector. To demonstrate that the intermediate subcomplexes previously characterized were on the assembly pathway, we developed an in vitroreconstitution protocol. Preliminary experiments consisted of mixing extracts from vma4Δ and vma8Δ. These extracts were chosen because the former accumulates complex IV and the latter accumulates complex III, complexes which contain mutually exclusive subunits. Mixing crude extracts containing these complexes resulted in formation of complex II in a divalent cation-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A). We examined the effect of different anions and cations on complex II formation and observed that Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+ were all effective, whereas Zn2+ was ineffective (Fig.1 B). In fact, ZnCl2 caused the complete loss of complexes III and IV when combined with extracts containing these complexes (data not shown). Both MgCl2 and MgOAc2 were effective, suggesting that no specific anion is necessary for assembly. Occasionally, we observed weak assembly with NaCl, but the signal from complex II was faint and inconsistent. Because there is 1 mm EDTA in our extract buffer, we suspect that 5 mm Na+ may compete weakly and release enough endogenous divalent cations to effect some limited reconstitution. To show that the ATPase-specific subcomplexes were responsible for the appearance of complex II, we did a titration ofvma4Δ extract versus vma8Δ extract (Fig.2). The formation of complex II clearly depends upon both extracts, with maximal reconstitution occurring when the extracts are at near equal proportions. Likewise, complex III and IV both disappear as they become limiting. It is interesting to note that complex VI (Vma7p, Vma8p) does not decrease significantly until complex IV (Vma1p, Vma2p, Vma7p, Vma8p) has first been consumed, suggesting that complex IV is a more direct precursor to complex II than is complex VI. Under the conditions where complex III becomes limiting, we see the formation of a new complex, designated complex Q. This complex only appears in reconstitutions where vma4Δ is one of the partners and may be an intermediate complex between IV and II. It runs at a position nearly identical to complex III. This complex is only weakly and transiently detectable relative to the other complexes observed, making complete analysis of its composition difficult. Because the assembly was dependent on the presence of Mg2+, we surmised it would be possible to gather kinetic data by stopping the assembly with the further addition of EDTA. Reactions were prepared by mixing two extracts on ice and then started with the addition of MgCl2(5 mm final) and the transfer to either ice or a 30 °C waterbath. Aliquots were taken at given time points and transferred to iced tubes containing EDTA (10 mm final concentration). From quantitation of native gels (Fig. 3), it can be seen that the assembly of complex II is temperature-dependent and occurs with a half-time of <5 min at 30 °C. We wished to know if some amount of in vivo assembly or modification was required for in vitro assembly to occur. To test this, we attempted reconstitutions with all possible combinations of extracts, and the results are summarized in Table II. All combinations were able to support formation of complex II, except for vma4Δ × vma10Δ and occasionallyvma1Δ × vma2Δ (see below). Kinetics of assembly in all positive combinations were similar to thevma4Δ × vma8Δ cross, with half-times of ∼5 min (data not shown). The vma4Δ × vma10Δcombination, which completely lacks complex III ab initio, does not support formation of complex II under any conditions tested. However, we have observed that the steady-state levels of Vma4p are extremely low in vma10Δ cells and that Vma4p is rapidly degraded in this strain.2 Thus, levels of Vma4p may be the limiting factor. However, assembly of this complex may depend upon conditions found only in the intact cell.Table IIComplex II assembly in different extract combinationsSecond extractFirst extractvma1Δvma2Δvma4Δvma7Δvma8Δvma10Δvma1Δ−±++++vma2Δ−++++vma4Δ−++−vma7Δ−++vma8Δ−+vma10Δ− Open table in a new tab Because we observed reassembly in most cases, even those where there were no pre-existing large complexes in either of the starting extracts, it remained an open question whether or not complex II assembles directly from subcomplexes or from individual subunits that became available as the subcomplexes dissociate. In particular, we decided to examine if complex IV is competent for further assembly without dissociation. To examine this, we employed the epitope-tagged Vma7p (4Graham L.A. Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25974-25977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to label complex IV as shown in the scheme in Fig. 4 A. By creating tagged and untagged complex IV and then complementing itin vitro with vma8Δ extract containing untagged or tagged Vma7p, respectively, we could determine if complex IV was dissassembled because its Vma7p would mix with that in the total reaction. The presence of the tagged Vma7p causes a slight shift in the position of complex IV (Fig. 4 B, right panel, lane 1 versus lane 2) and the position of complex II (Fig. 4 B,right panel, lanes 5 and 8 versus lanes 6 and7). There is also the appearance of an additional signal below complex VI. The tagged Vma7p is found in complex II only when it begins in complex IV (Fig. 4 B, right panel versus left panel, lanes 5 and 8). Tagged Vma7p is excluded from complex II when complex IV in the reaction contains only untagged Vma7p (Fig. 4 B, right panel versus left panel, lanes 6 and 7). Levels of tagged Vma7p were comparable in the extracts from the strains in which this construct was expressed (Fig. 4 C). These results indicate that complex IV is a bonafide intermediate on the pathway to formation of complex II and that dissociation of complex IV does not occur to any appreciable extent prior to complex II assembly. We also note a similar result for complex VI; free Vma7pHA does not replace Vma7p that is present in a complex with Vma8p (Fig. 4 B, lane 6). To demonstrate that complex II was not a dead-end product itself, we undertook experiments to show it could assemble on isolated vacuolar membranes containing V0. We prepared membranes from vma2Δ, which have been shown to contain V0 without peripheral subunits (6Parra K.J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19592-19598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We also prepared vacuolar membranes from vma3Δ, which do not contain V0, as a control. Cytosolic extract fromvma3Δ, which contains large quantities of complex II, was combined with these membranes both in the presence (Fig.5) and absence (data not shown) of MgCl2. We observed that MgCl2 was necessary for association with the membrane. After a 25-min incubation at 30 °C, membranes were pelleted and examined by immunoblot for the presence of V1subunits. Association with the membrane is dependent upon both cytosol containing complex II and membranes containing V0. The membranes fromvma2Δ show the presence of representative V1subunits found in complex II. Membrane binding is specific as evidenced by the absence of complex II subunits from the vma3Δmembranes. The membranes from vma2Δ also bring down Vma13p, a protein that has been shown to be necessary for activity but not assembly of the V-ATPase (7Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of native gels with antibodies to Vma13p gave equivocal results (data not shown); it may be a component of complex II, but it does not appear to be associated with any other complex. Interestingly, Vma5p is not associated with the membrane, which may explain our inability to detect activity from these membranes (data not shown). The V-ATPase has been observed to assemble without this subunit in other systems although its presence does enhance the level of activity (8Puopolo K. Sczekan M. Magner R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5171-5176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the yeast vma5Δstrain, no V-ATPase activity is detected, and the V1subunits are found assembled but not attached to the membrane (2Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10397-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9Ho M.N. Hill K.J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vma5p may be involved in a transient interaction, necessary for attachment and full activity but not necessary for maintenance of a stable V1V0 association. Our data suggest that complex II is capable of assembly onto the V0 sector of the V-ATPase. Under our standard conditions for reconstitution, we found weak assembly of complex II from thevma1Δ × vma2Δ combination. Upon further examination, it was found that assembly of complex II fromvma1Δ × vma2Δ could be enhanced by the addition of 1 mm ATP. Measurement of assembly kinetics with MgATP, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+ reveal both a lag and lower overall assembly without added ATP (Fig.6). Because the extracts have not been depleted for triphosphonucleotides, there may be residual ATP available to support limited reconstitution in the absence of added ATP. Attempts to deplete the extracts with apyrase and hexokinase did abolish assembly (data not shown), although subsequent add-back of ATP was impossible due to the presence of the scavenger. ATP analogues such as ATPγS and AMP-PNP showed no significant effect by themselves and did not show any competition at concentrations from 0.1 to 10 times the ATP concentration (data not shown). Interestingly, the divalent cation dependence for vma1Δ × vma2Δ is ion-specific and parallels reported preferences of divalent cations for ATPase activity (10Kakinuma Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10859-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tognoli L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 146: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 12Wang Z.-Q. Gluck S. J. Biol.

To determine if ATP binding at the catalytic site was important to formation of complex II, we examined the ability of N-ethyl maleimide to inhibit assembly. NEM reacts specifically and irreversibly with a cysteine residue in the active site on Vma1p (14Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recombination reaction of vma1Δ × vma2Δ, which was first treated with NEM followed by ATP showed no reconstitution, whereas if first treated with ATP, weak reconsititution was observed (Fig. 7 A). More significantly, if the deletion extracts were treated separately, pretreatment ofvma2Δ (containing Vma1p) with NEM abolishes reconstitution while pretreatment of vma1Δ (containing Vma2p) with NEM is still capable of assembly (Fig. 7 B). This strongly suggests that binding of ATP at a functional catalytic site is necessary for assembly of the V1 complex since the cytosolic constituents of these two extracts should be identical except for the specific Vma proteins. As our revised model makes clear, this can be elegantly coordinated with the favored mechanistic model, the Boyer binding-change mechanism. Biosynthesis and assembly of multimeric proteins into their quaternary structures must be regulated by both kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. The stability of complex II suggests that it is a thermodynamic trap, making it the dominant complex in wild-type cells and also allowing us to form it in vitro. We do not see complex IV form in vitro, even under conditions where we assume it must be a transient intermediate (e.g. thevma1Δ × vma2Δ reaction) because its equilibrium favors dissociation into smaller complexes or individual subunits unless it can further assemble to complex II. Attempts to form complex IV in vitro (vma4Δvma7Δ ×vma4Δvma8Δ) were unsuccessful (data not shown). Once formed, the attachment and detachment of complex II to the membrane sector would then have an equilibrium independent of the levels of individual subunits. Assembly and disassembly of the V1V0 has been proposed as a mechanism of regulation (15Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is supported by the hyperassembly of V1onto V0 in cells with point mutations in V0sector subunits that abolish function but not assembly (16Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This equilibrium would be regulated by other subunits, e.g.Vma5p, which is not necessary for assembly of V1 but is required for assembly on the membrane in vivo and is involved in glucose deprivation-mediated modification of the V1 following detachment from the membrane sector. 3J. Tomashek, unpublished data. Interestingly, cytosolic V1 complexes, which apparently do not exchange with membrane-bound complexes, have been observed in tissue culture cells (17Myers M. Forgac M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). What the role of such complexes might be and whether they exist in yeast remain to be determined. In contrast, assembly steps from individual subunits to complex II depend on temperature, divalent cation, and nucleotide. At 30 °C, our kinetic data indicate that most combinations of deletion strains assemble with roughly equal half-times (∼5 min) although there is a tendency for extracts containing higher order complexes to show faster assembly (compare Fig. 3 with Fig. 6). At lower temperatures, measurable differences in assembly rates may appear and reveal key steps where kinetic control assumes a larger role. We have expanded our previous assembly models to consider these data (Fig. 8). In addition to our data which support the model, we favor it because of its similarity to the Boyer binding-change model of F-type ATP synthase catalysis (18Boyer P.D. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2164-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), a mechanism which has been proposed for the V-type enzymes as well (19Kasho V.N. Boyer P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8708-8711Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The Boyer model proposes three sites, catalytically equivalent over time but instantaneously nonequivalent. We hypothesize that these three possible states (MgATP bound (T), MgADP/Pi bound (D), and open (O)) are not energetically equivalent. Thus, if assembly begins with the association of Vma1p and Vma2p to form the catalytic site (found predominantly on Vma1p but shared by both), one of these three states may be preferred, and an accumulation of dimers in one state would result. The suggestion that these two subunits associate to form a catalytic site is supported by recent evidence that these two subunits have low but detectable ATPase activity higher than either individual subunit (20Xie X.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30980-30985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, our own two-hybrid data indicate that Vma1p and Vma2p can interact independent of other subunits. Here, we propose that this interaction nucleates around the catalytic site of the heterodimer and suggest that MgATP stabilizes this dimerization. Thus, Vma1p-T-Vma2p is the most favored of the three possible initial complexes. Association with another subunit or subcomplex, in our model complex VI, would convert Vma1p-T-Vma2p into a new state stabilized by both hydrolysis of the nucleotide and incorporation of the new subunits into the growing complex. We prefer a model where association of the two subcomplexes (Vma1p-T-Vma2p and VI) would precede hydrolysis of ATP. In our model, complex VI acts as a nucleotidase activating factor, similar to GTPase activating proteins. After the catalytic step, complex VI (associated now with Vma1p-D-Vma2p) is situated to bind another Vma1p-T-Vma2p dimer from the cytosolic pool. The result is the formation of complex IV, which now has two catalytic sites each in a different energetic state defined by their nucleotide contents and interactions with complex VI. Complex III (Vma4p-Vma10p) may now interact with the Vma1p-D-Vma2p portion of complex IV, and stimulate release of the nucleotide and phosphate. In this sense, complex III is a nucleotide exchange factor. Release of ADP and Pi, in turn, allows hydrolysis to proceed at the second site, and thus the core subunits become positioned to receive the third Vma1p-T-Vma2p dimer. The final complex now has the three different sites in the correct energetic states necessary for catalysis to commence. The complete V1 might be regarded as three ATPases rotating around a complex of hydrolysis activating and nucleotide exchange factors. This model also accommodates an explanation for why ATP analogues have no apparent effect on assembly. The ATP-bound site is, based on the Boyer model, predicted to be of extremely high affinity. However, this may be true only for the ATP-bound site in the complete enzyme,i.e. of the last site added during assembly (incorporation of which makes the site “tight”). The Vma1p-T-Vma2p free dimer may have a low affinity and high exchange rate for nucleotide. Thus, in the absence of ATP, the analogues would not support assembly because they cannot be hydrolyzed. In the presence of ATP, the analogues would compete at high enough concentration but not block assembly, even if they were incorporated into the final “tight” site (although this would poison the enzyme). In our experiments, we are not able to eliminate completely endogenous ATP. NEM, which binds covalently and irreversibly, does block assembly. What about complexes I and V? Complex V, seen in significant steady-state amounts only from vma4Δ andvma10Δ extracts, disappears very rapidly at 30 °C or when combined with other extracts, and thus could not be followed in our assays. Complex I appears in the absence of Vma7p, a subunit which we have implicated in early assembly events. Because complex I is very unstable, we believe it may be an artifactual complex that assembles incorrectly, accepting Vma8p alone in lieu of complex VI. As a result, the catalytic dimers would all be in the Vma1p-T-Vma2p configuration, or possibly a combination of Vma1p-T-Vma2p and Vma1p-O-Vma2p, if complex III is able to release ATP from the second site incorporated. Because the energetic states in complex I would be discoordinated, disassembly of this complex may be necessary for subsequent correct assembly to occur. Therefore, complex I may be the dead end of an artifactual pathway that occurs only because of the absence of Vma7p. Our assembly system is different from previously described reconstitution systems from plants (21Ward J.M. Sze H. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 50: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), animals (20Xie X.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30980-30985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Puopolo K. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14836-14841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and yeast (6Parra K.J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19592-19598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) in three significant ways. First, we do not rely on chemical treatment (e.g. nitrate, iodide, or urea) to break apart the V-ATPase, a treatment which may chemically modify the enzyme (23Dschida W.J.A. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1557-1563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Instead, we begin with subunits and partially assembled complexes in a physiological milieu. Second, we are working with crude extracts, whereas other reconstitution has been done with purified enzymes and heterologously expressed subunits. Thus, we cannot exclude the involvement of factors apart from the ATPase subunits themselves. Third, we have been as yet unable to recover activity, while other systems have obtained detectable yields of activity from dialyzed mixtures of subunits. However, we expect with further attenuation to be able to recover activity and identify the specific factors responsible. Reassembly in other systems is achieved in the absence of Mg2+ and ATP and at 4 °C, albeit after long incubation and dialysis. From the results in our system, we believe assembly of the V1 complex is an ordered process that recapitulates its proposed functional mechanism. We hope that further experiments will provide greater insight regarding the validity of this provocative ATPase assembly model.

https://doi.org/10.1111/eth.13212,The Evolution of Social Behaviour,"In July 2020, Michael Taborsky officially retired as Professor in Behavioural Ecology at the University of Bern, Switzerland. His scientific life has been, and still is devoted to revealing the fundamental principles of social evolution by natural selection, based on conflict and cooperation among individuals. Colleagues, collaborators and students celebrate this occasion with a symposium on the evolution of social behaviour in September 2021, in which former colleagues, collaborators and students present their current research. This special issue on The Evolution of Social Behaviour is a companion to this event and includes contributions of almost all symposium speakers. Having been trained as a classical behavioural ecologist, during his further scientific life Michael recognized the central necessity to study ultimate and proximate causation of behaviour in conjunction. The breadth of the contributions to this special issue nicely mirrors the multifaceted interests and integrative scientific approach of Michael to animal behaviour. The contributors to this special issue selected Ethology as outlet because this journal represents and encourages this integrative approach ever since its foundation, and not the least because Michael served as Editor-in-Chief of Ethology for 11 years, from 1999 to 2010. Ethology offers their authors a wide spectrum of article types. Accordingly, this special issue contains a bouquet of contributions. The issue includes Perspective and Reviews papers asking how cooperative breeding may help or hinder coping with environmental change (Komdeur & Ma, 2021), highlighting the possibility that sociality is more widespread in marine habitats than usually assumed (Mazzei & Rubenstein, 2021), or how individual social competence may further the evolution of sociality and vice versa (Taborsky, 2021). Oliveira and Bshary (2021) propose to include interspecific relationships into social behaviour, and Bender (2021) outlines the potential for ethology to improve the evolutionary understanding of human medical problems. Original Research papers ask whether naked mole rats express caste differentiation (Siegmann et al., 2021), whether rats are aware of the ability of partners to reciprocate food donations (Schweinfurth, 2021), propose novel imaging techniques in the study of sociality (Jungwirth et al., 2021), show how collective actions can lead to diversification of behaviours (Green et al., 2021) and illustrate the importance of the early social environment for learning abilities in cichlids (Fischer et al., 2021) and later life attraction to conspecific odours (Schneeberger & Eccard, 2021). Tebbich et al., (2021) provides the first quantitative account of self-anointment in birds. Two Species-in-the-Spotlight articles provide comprehensive insights into the social systems and sociality of crotophagine cuckoos (Riehl, 2021) and vampire bats (Carter, 2021). Finally, an Ethological Methods article explores the usefulness of mirrors to score aggression across cichlids (Josi & Frommen, 2021). The compilation of articles for this special issue underlines the extraordinary diversity of Michael's research on the evolution of social behaviour. Beyond that, it mirrors one of Michael's fancies to dive deeply into discussions on exciting scientific questions, no matter whether it concerns his own fields of research or entirely unrelated topics. Among his colleagues, Michaels is certainly best known for his large body of research on the evolution of cooperation. Cooperation has been considered one of the most fundamental questions of biology ever since Darwin, and current consensus in primary literature and biology textbooks has been that kin selection is generally responsible for the evolution of cooperation among social partners. Michael's research on different vertebrate and invertebrate study systems demonstrated, however, that this focus is way too narrow. His work revealed that cooperation originates by an interaction of several evolutionary mechanisms, involving kin selection, negotiation and trading, and enforcement, depending on social and ecological forces of natural selection. Michael further measured the fitness consequences of males and females in two very different fish systems both exhibiting three alternative male mating tactics allowing to understand how such multiple morphs can evolve and be maintained; and he deciphered the intricate decision rules Norway rats use when reciprocating help received by others. In the era of the ""phenotypic gambit,"" when Michael was trained in behavioural ecology, mechanisms of behaviour were considered to be unnecessary for understanding evolution. However, very early on Michael adopted an integrative angle on animal behaviour. Building on Tinbergen's famous ""four questions"" (Tinbergen 1963), Michael was convinced that to understand the function (""why"") one also has to know ""how"" animals accomplish their behaviour (e.g., Hofmann et al., 2014; Taborsky et al., 2015; Taborsky & Taborsky, 2015). Above all, he wanted to understand the decision rules animals use when expressing social behaviours, exemplified by his work on Norway rats, but Michael also strived to understand the sensory (Gerber et al., 2020; Schneeberger et al., 2020), energetic (Grantner & Taborsky, 1998; Taborsky & Grantner, 1998) and hormonal (Bender et al., 2006, 2008) underpinnings of social behaviour. While Michael developed mastery in the art of testing ultimate and proximate concepts by sophisticated experiments in the field and in the laboratory, often involving targeted behavioural manipulations of particular focal or stimulus individuals, he combined his empirical work with theoretical modelling to understand cooperative behaviour on evolutionary time scales. Rather than heuristic proof-of-concept models with a high degree of abstraction, Michael aimed at informing the models by biological insights gained from his empirical work, even at the cost of greater model complexity (e.g., van Doorn &Taborsky, 2012; Hamilton & Taborsky, 2005; Quinones et al., 2016). Few people may know that Michaels started his career in fact as a Lorenzian style ""goose maid,"" working as a volunteer at the Max-Planck Institute for Behavioural Physiology in Seewiesen. When he joined this institute in the late 1970s, he hand-raised bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) for a project of Jürg Lamprecht. The goslings imprinted on Michael and followed him all day at every turn. Michael stayed in Seewiesen to start his PhD, dwelling deeply into the costs and benefits of cooperative breeding. It was the time when the first functional studies on cooperatively breeding birds (Emlen, 1982; Koenig, 1981; Reyer, 1980) and mammals (Rasa, 1977) caused quite some excitement: cooperative breeding was considered a major evolutionary riddle, because it seemed to contradict the maximization of individual fitness to forgo own reproduction in order to raise foreign young. When Michael came to Seewiesen, Kalas (1976) just had described the basics of the social system of an apparently cooperatively breeding cichlid fish from Lake Tanganyika, Neolamprologus brichardi. Sociality of these fish were chosen as PhD topic of Michael and his colleague Dominique Limberger, who used the fantastic opportunities this system offers to study cooperative breeding experimentally in the laboratory and in the field. Michael's thesis, handed in at the University of Vienna in 1982, contained a most detailed cost–benefit analysis of helping behaviour from the perspectives of subordinates and dominant breeders (Taborsky, 1984, 1985; Taborsky & Limberger, 1981). He would return for an in-depth study of this cichlid system only several years later. When I met Michael in Seewiesen in 1981, I was an ornithologist aiming for a scientific career studying birds. I did not consider fish as super-exciting, to say the least. However, I was taught better. As first postdoctoral project, Michael studied alternative male reproductive tactics (ARTs) in Mediterranean ocellated wrasses, Symphodus occellatus. I joined him as a field assistant and was truly astounded to see that fish have diverse and fine-tuned means of behaving and communicating, form stable, individual relationships and recognize each other. Ocellated wrasses feature three male ARTs, nest-building burgeois males, tolerated satellite males that help defending against sneakers, and female mimic sneakers, which steal fertilizations. Remarkably, satellites parasitically spawn themselves and therefore do not enhance the net fertilization success of nest males. Yet, nest males benefit from satellites, as their presence indicates a successful nest to females (Taborsky et al., 1987). Michael's second postdoc project, still at the MPI in Seewiesen, was on birds—much to my delight. However, these particular birds were unusual in almost any respect and on top of that they were pretty much invisible. Michael became hooked to a species featuring one of the most extreme parental investments among animals, the flightless and fully nocturnal North Island brown kiwi, Apteryx mantelli. Females of the size of a small chicken lay yolk-rich eggs weighing up to half a kilo, incubated by males for 3 months. Reproduction drives both sexes to their critical limits of energy expenditure (Taborsky & Taborsky 1993). The question was why such extreme investment pattern would evolve. Also, should one not expect that during this long male incubation, female partners would seek their chances of multiple matings? This project, aspects of which became my diploma and doctoral topics, challenged the limits of technical feasibility and required all our investigative skills to obtain quantitative data on the behaviour and energetics of this secretive species. Our first, fruitless weeks of the first field season we spent trying various more or less sophisticated methods to catch kiwis, until we had to accept that the only way to catch a kiwi is by trying to run faster than it and catch it by hand. Needless to say that more often than not the kiwis were winning the race. It turned out that kiwis live in stable pairs and are socially and genetically monogamous (Taborsky & Taborsky, 1991, 1992, 1999). Males need a long recovery time after incubation, during which they lose all their energy reserves. But why are females 100% faithful to their male partners? Simply because they cannot lay more of these jumbo eggs. Egg formation also greatly depletes their reserves, and so they cannot compensate energy loss fast enough to engage in mating with other males (Taborsky & Taborsky, 1993). In 1985, Michael took up a permanent research position at the Konrad-Lorenz Institute of Comparative Ethology (KLIVV) in Vienna, where he also served as deputy director since 1993. While waiting for a generous aquarium facility to be built at the KLIVV for cichlid research, he and myself started a project on another unusual bird. This time, the species was able to fly and active during the day—so far so good. But it was odd in another way: it was an obligate brood parasite. We started this project, because it was still unknown how females of the European cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, find the ""correct"" host species for which they lay a mimetic egg among the roughly 100 potential host species. Host imprinting, the most popular hypothesis at this time, according to which young learn the phenotype of their host as nestlings, was not supported in an experiment by Brooke and Davies (1991). We set out to perform a hand-rearing experiment, testing an alternative hypothesis—the habitat-imprinting hypothesis, proposing that cuckoo chicks learn the habitat type around their nest and return to this habitat as adults for egg laying. We hand-reared seven cuckoo chicks in differently shaped and coloured artificial ""habitats."" While cuckoo chicks are clearly early birds, neither Michael nor I are. So during the early morning hours, the chicks were placed next to our bed to ensure they get their hourly meals from 6:00 am, and in between we still could catch some additional sleep. As adults, the cuckoos were tested in the huge flying hall of the KLIVV for their habitat preferences. When given the simultaneous choice between all possible rearing habitats and a natural reed habitat, they indeed preferred to watch nest-building songbirds within the habitat they had been imprinted on (Teuschl et al., 1998). In a radio-telemetry study in the Czech Republik, further support for this hypothesis was accumulated (Vogl et al., 2002, 2004), and a recent cross-continental study using ringing data confirmed that after first migration, cuckoos return to habitats resembling the ones they grew up in (Kolecek et al., 2020). In 2000, Michael was offered an ordinary professorship and chair of the Division of Behavioural Ecology at the Institute of Ecology and Evolution of the University of Bern, Switzerland, situated in the picturesque Ethological Station Hasli, a 300-year-old farm in a nature reserve next to the river Aare. During the two decades he worked in Bern, Michael's main focus remained on the study of social behaviour, in particular cooperative breeding in Neolamprologus pulcher and of alternative reproductive tactics in Lepidiolamprologus callipterus. In addition, he started to work on reciprocal interactions in wild-type Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) and on cooperative breeding in ambrosia beetles. Parallel to experimental work in the laboratory, from 1995 on, Michael started yearly expeditions to Zambia, where he established a field station in Kasakalawe near Mpulungu, which is now open to cichlid research teams from all over the world. Neolamprologus pulcher (see Cover Illustration of this issue) is certainly Michael's most intensively studied and best understood study system. It is a cooperatively breeding cichlid, in which a dominant breeder pair and helpers jointly care for eggs and larvae produced by dominants until free-swimming, guard them from egg and fish predators, and maintain the quality of breeding territory. Several features diverge significantly from those of most other cooperative breeders. (a) Michael's team found that one particular ecological factor—predation pressure—predominantly triggers sociality in this species (Groenewoud et al., 2016; Heg et al., 2004; Taborsky, 1985) whereas resource availability, habitat saturation or climatic unpredictability play less of a role for sociality in these fish. The risk to be predated, mainly by large piscivores, explains why N. pulcher breed in colonies (Jungwirth et al., 2015), have extended natal philopatry (Heg et al., 2004), why helpers strategically adjust their growth (Heg et al., 2004b) and why helpers pay to stay to be accepted by the dominants of a group (Taborsky, 1985). Cooperative breeding in N. pulcher reflects a system of negotiation and reciprocal trading of commodities (Quinones et al., 2016). Safety of subordinates is traded against energetic load-lightning of breeders (Taborsky et al., 2007; Zöttl et al., 2013a) and offspring survival (Brouwer et al., 2005), and this is stabilized by a latent threat of punishment and eviction (Fischer et al., 2014). (b) Another peculiarity of N. pulcher is their marked size-dependent division of labour (Taborsky & Limberger, 1981; Taborsky, 1984; Taborsky et al., 1986, Bruintjes & Taborsky 2011), which is possible because many different sizes are present in a social group due to indeterminate growth. (c) Finally, N. pulcher groups consist of a mixture of related and unrelated individuals. Relatedness to breeders declines with helper age, so that large adult helpers, which are most efficient in providing help, are usually unrelated to the breeder's offspring and beneficiaries of help (Dierkes et al., 2005). Opposite to cooperative systems driven by kin selection, but in accordance with the pay-to-stay mechanism, in N. pulcher relatedness reduces cooperative effort (Zöttl et al., 2013b). Cooperative breeding can take entirely different forms in certain invertebrates. Next to fish, Michael worked on a cooperatively breeding beetle system exhibiting division of labour by age (age polyethism; Biedermann & Taborsky, 2011), and in which the relatedness between sisters is exceedingly high due to haplodiploidy and nearly obligate full-sib mating. Ambrosia beetles are a group of tiny bark beetles practising agriculture by cultivating fungi cultures (Biedermann et al., 2009), which they grow and harvest in a burrow system in the wood of dead trees. Due to high inbreeding, genetic conflict in these beetles is low; outbreeding even reduces their fitness (Peer & Taborsky, 2004, 2005). Additionally, sociality in ambrosia beetles may be furthered by the need to socially defend against pathogens, allowing the beetles to grow edible fungi, but not to be overgrown by harmful germs (Nuotcla et al., 2019). Moreover, humidity of the wood influences the viability of fungi and the timing of beetle dispersal (Nuotcla et al., 2021). With one of his first PhD students in Bern, Claudia Rutte, Michael sought for a system suited to study reciprocity and trading between animals more directly—they decided to study wild-type Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, which turned out to be a lucky pull. In the past two decades, Michael's team unfolded an unforeseen diversity of simple as well as complex decision rules how Norway rats exchange goods and services. After demonstrating that rats use direct reciprocity, requiring to remember previous co-operators or defectors (Rutte & Taborsky, 2008), these authors showed that rats can also reciprocate by a much simpler rule: In generalized reciprocity, help is triggered by receiving help by any other individual, a mechanism requiring minimal cognitive capacity (Rutte & Taborsky, 2007). While in rats direct reciprocity generates a higher propensity for cooperation than generalized reciprocity, a study in dogs revealed that here both direct and generalized reciprocity trigger similar cooperation levels (Gfrerer & Taborsky, 2017). Several theoretical models showed that generalized reciprocity can be evolutionary stabilized by social relationships or by state (Barta et al., 2011; van Doorn & Taborsky, 2012; Pfeiffer et al., 2005). Rats exhibit direct reciprocity when exchanging goods (e.g., food; Rutte & Taborsky, 2008) or services (allogroming; Schweinfurth et al., 2017) of the same commodity, when interaction partners use the same or different methods for the exchange (e.g., pulling a bar for pushing a lever, Schweinfurth & Taborsky, 2017), and also when exchanging different commodities (e.g., food for allogrooming, Schweinfurth & Taborsky, 2018a). They can remember cooperative and defective partners over several days (Schweinfurth & Taborsky, 2020) and likewise remember the actions of different cooperative or defective partners (Kettler et al., 2021). Remarkably, reciprocal cooperation is lower between related than unrelated rats (Schweinfurth & Taborsky, 2018b). Mechanistically, reciprocal exchange of food in rats is triggered by the smell of helpful (Gerber et al., 2020) or of hungry partners (Schneeberger et al., 2020). In the work on rats as well as in extensive reviews across animal taxa, Michael proved the long held belief wrong that reciprocity is rare in nature (Taborsky et al., 2016, 2021). Ever since his first postdoctoral project on Mediterranean wrasses, Michael kept being fascinated by the question how ARTS are evolutionary stabilized. Similar to the wrasses, the cichlid Lepidiolamprologus callipterus exhibits three alternative male types. Large bourgeois males build and vigorously defend nests made of hundreds of empty snail shells. The much smaller females use these shells to deposit their eggs, and they care for their offspring for two weeks in the shells. Bourgeois males and females of L. callipterus exhibit the most extreme sexual size dimorphism in animals in this direction: males are 12 times heavier than females. A series of meticulous experiments (Schütz & Taborsky, 2000, 2005) and a theoretical model (Schütz et al., 2006) revealed that divergent selection pressures—with males being selected to grow large enough to carry shells during nest building and with females being selected to remain small enough to fit into the shells—are driving this extreme dimorphism. Nest males inseminate eggs through the shell opening, a tactic also followed by intermediate-sized sneakers. However, there is also a tiny dwarf male morph able to pass by females and to inseminate offspring while sitting in the tip of the snail shell. Dwarf males that make it to the shell tip achieve on average 78% of fertilizations, but are rarely successful in reaching this favourable position (Wirtz-Ocana et al., 2014). A breeding experiment revealed that unlike most ARTS in other vertebrates, bourgeois and dwarf tactics represent genetic morphs that are inherited on the y-chromosome, whereas females are monomorphic (Wirtz-Ocana et al., 2013, 2014). The different male types and females engage in intricate behavioural interactions, which can even end deadly for females when a new bourgeois male takes over an existing nest (Maan & Taborsky, 2008). But different male types also heavily compete via sperm competition (Schütz et al., 2010, 2017; Taborsky et al., 2018). Michael summarized his insights gained from this species and other systems exhibiting ARTs in several conceptual articles (Taborsky, 1994, 1997, 1998). In 2008, Rui Oliveira, Michael and Jane Brockmann compiled a comprehensive edited book about ARTs (Oliveira et al., 2008), presenting 20 contributed chapters summarizing the most recent knowledge on all major taxa featuring ARTs. In the past years, Michael and his colleagues Mike Cant and Jan Komdeur set out for the major endeavour to write a book explaining the evolution of the stunning diversity in social systems and behaviours in animals. Arguably, most social behaviour results from competition. Grounded in evolutionary theory, their book synthesizes the current knowledge on cooperation and conflict into a simple framework for predicting how animals cope with competition. The authors argue that individuals can succeed in resource competition by ""racing"" others, that is being faster than others in accessing resources, ""fighting"" for exclusive access or ""sharing"" both the efforts and gains. After many years of intense writing and discussions among the authors, sweetened by a few writing retreats in the Swiss Alps or the Dutch Atlantic coast, this comprehensive work appeared in August 2021 (Taborsky et al., 2021). Being at a university, Michael also was involved in a number of duties as university administrator. Apart from being a member of countless commissions, he had been Director of the Institute of Ecology and Evolution, Acting Director of the Biology Department and Vice-Dean of the Phil.-Nat. faculty, some of these duties repeatedly. As a teacher, in the many lectures, seminars and practical courses Michael gave and organized, a major aim was to make students engage in scientific discussions, rather than just consuming contents. As supervisor of his almost 40 PhD students, 17 Post-Docs and countless master and bachelor students, he focussed on training young researchers in all aspects of the scientific method, including the use and development of evolutionary concepts and asking critical questions. An integral part of his student training was to encourage everyone, including master students, to publish their results. He spent uncountable hours to correct manuscripts and to get them ready for publication. Last not least Michael substantially inspired and motivated me throughout my own career. Therefore, I would like to end on a personal note. I have been asked several times how it is possible to not only share table and bed with someone, but also to work with that person next doors all days. I can only say: it worked perfectly well. I cannot imagine a more inspiring and supportive partner in life, in science or in any of the small and large everyday challenges we are confronted with. I am indebted to all authors contributing to this issue and all the referees providing their reviews promptly, helping to get the issue ready in time for the symposium. We all hope it will be a wonderful surprise for the honorand.",W3199728650,True,0.911685585975647
https://doi.org/10.1002/imt2.101,"Plastisphere microbiome: Methodology, diversity, and functionality","Broad topics of the plastisphere in various environments are reviewed, including its methodologies, diversity, functionality, and outlook. Due to their durability, malleability, and low cost, plastics have become an integral material of industrial and consumer products [1]. Global plastic production has enormously grown from 1.5 million metric tonnes in 1950 and 367 million metric tonnes in 2020 [2]. Despite the remarkable benefits and convenience of plastics to human lives, awareness about the negative environmental impacts has increased because of the vast amount of plastic waste. It is estimated that approximately 12,000 metric tonnes of plastic waste will be accumulated globally by 2050 [3]. Under the action of external forces, for example, solar radiation, physical abrasion, and biological degradation, large pieces of plastics can break down into smaller particles, generating microplastics (diameter < 5 mm) [4-6]. Accumulating studies show that microplastics are ubiquitous throughout various environments, including marine, freshwater, atmospheric, and soil ecosystems, even in the remotest areas of the planet [7-11]. Their presence and persistence in environments have raised significant concerns as microplastics can be ingested and subsequently transmitted to higher trophic-level organisms through the food chain, and thus harm biodiversity and ecosystems [12-14]. As an exogenous and hydrophobic substrate, microplastic surfaces can provide a unique niche for the growth and proliferation of a diversity of microorganisms, constituting a distinct ecological habitat called the ""plastisphere"" [15-17]. Following the development of modern molecular methods and emerging bioinformatics tools, the application of high-throughput DNA sequencing is increasing our understanding of the diverse microorganisms that inhabit the plastisphere [18, 19]. However, the consensus is lacking in the scientific community on the characteristics of the plastisphere. For instance, previous studies dominantly reported that the plastisphere microbial communities showed different compositional structures compared with the microbial communities living in surrounding environments, whereas several studies observed similar microbial communities on microplastics [20, 21]. The microbial diversity in the plastisphere could be higher or lower than that in the surrounding communities [22, 23]. Additionally, similar or distinct microbial functions may be observed within the plastisphere [24, 25]. Plastisphere studies focused initially on the marine environment and gradually extended to the freshwater and soil environments, and even indoor house environments [26-30]. The various environmental matrices also limited the definitive answers on the characteristics of the plastisphere. Several critical questions concerning the plastisphere remain unclear. Currently, whether microplastics really recruit specific microbial communities is unknown, and few studies have clearly illustrated the ecological processes shaping the microbial assembly on microplastics. How stochastic and deterministic processes influence the plastisphere communities remain unclear, and knowledge gaps exist concerning the adverse effects that the plastisphere may pose to the environment and ecosystem. Therefore, for this review, peer-reviewed journal articles that investigated the plastisphere on microplastics were searched using the Web of Science ( with the keywords ""microplastic(s)"" and ""plastisphere"" (Figure S1), and the study designs and characterization methods exploring the plastisphere in different environments are consequently discussed. The composition, diversity, and underlying ecological mechanisms of the plastisphere were also estimated. We end by considering important unanswered questions in this field and future research priorities. This review provides a comprehensive interpretation of the plastisphere microbial communities. Dr. Erik Zettler and colleagues first established the concept of the ""plastisphere"" in 2013 (Figure S1). High-throughput sequencing method was used in their study to characterize the diverse microbial community of heterotrophs, autotrophs, predators, and symbionts on marine plastic debris collected from the North Atlantic [16]. Following this study, the plastisphere in the marine environment was extensively investigated [19]. Studies on the plastisphere in the freshwater ecosystem started in 2014 as researchers gradually recognized that marine microplastics originated from freshwater systems. In that year, Hoellein and colleagues published two papers on the plastisphere in freshwater ecosystems [17, 31]. One study used high-throughput sequencing method to describe the bacterial assemblages colonizing microplastics sampled from an urbanized river in Chicago, Illinois, USA. The other study incubated plastispheres in three freshwater ecosystems (river, pond, and artificial stream, respectively). Community compositions on microplastics were observed to significantly differ with the respective planktonic communities. In comparison with marine and freshwater systems, soil matrices are more complex, containing variable proportions of mineral and organic matter. Tracing a solid analyte in a sample composed of solids is more difficult, and this delayed the analysis of soil plastisphere to a later period. In 2019, Huang and colleagues applied farmland field sampling and laboratory soil incubation, respectively, to estimate the characteristics of the soil plastisphere [32, 33]. In the same year, Puglisi et al. investigated the plastic-associated biofilm in constructed solid waste disposal systems (landfill sites) [34]. These studies found that the plastisphere communities showed distinct microbial diversities, community compositions, and co-occurrence interactions compared with those in the surrounding environmental microbial communities. The plastisphere in the atmosphere environment was investigated in the most recent years. In 2022, Wang and colleagues estimated the plastisphere in an indoor environment via artificial incubation [35]. In summary, plastisphere studies followed the detection of microplastics in different environments, which originates in marine environments, extends to freshwater ecosystems, and finally, to terrestrial habitats and other artificial environments. The methodology to estimate the characteristics of the plastisphere is manifold. In general, plastisphere samples are collected via three routes: field sampling, in situ field culture, and laboratory-simulated experimentation (Tables S1–S3, Figure 1). The proportions of the three methods in studying the aquatic plastispheres are approximately the same, whereas the laboratory-simulated experiments dominate the soil plastisphere studies. For the field sampling studies, the researchers collect the microplastics from aquatic or terrestrial ecosystems, pick up the microplastics, and analyze the microbial communities on the microplastics. The sampling and sorting of microplastics from liquid and solid samples have different details. In the aquatic environments, microplastic sampling methods are similar for both fresh and seawater samples. Manta or plankton nets are commonly used, and the collected particles are identified and selected on the spot [20, 36, 37]. For sampling in sediment or soil, solid grab samplers are often used; the collected bulk solid samples are sieved, and the putative microplastics are extracted [38-40]. The sampled microplastics are transferred to the laboratories on dry ice, and stored at −80°C before analysis. For studies using in situ field culture, microplastics are selected with certain polymer types and shapes and are then incubated in the field environments under natural conditions. After a specific duration, the microplastics are collected, and the microbial communities on their surface are analyzed [41-43]. For studies using simulated laboratory experiments, microplastics are incubated under controlled conditions (e.g., pH, nutrients, and temperature) [27, 44, 45]. For studies simulating aquatic environments, a biofilm incubation system coupled with a continuous flow device is commonly used [46]. For laboratory soil microcosm experiments, microplastics are usually incubated in sterilized glass containers under specific conditions [28, 47]. These methods have both advantages and disadvantages. The field sampling method can reveal the realistic ecological characteristics of the plastisphere. However, the selection of microplastics needs to be performed immediately after the sampling in case the biofilms change. Direct visual examination by the naked eyes or with dissecting microscopes is usually employed, which would inevitably introduce non-polymer particles (e.g., mineral particles, oil residues, or chitin-like materials) and influence further analyses [48]. Additionally, plastisphere DNA is usually extracted from all the collected polymer particles; thus, it is difficult for the field sampling studies to identify the differences between polymer types. For instance, Li et al. [29] collected microplastics and their surrounding water samples in freshwater and seawater ecosystems and analyzed the microbial composition, functions, assembly processes, and interaction networks but did not identify the polymer types of the collected microplastics. Similarly, Luo et al. [24] sampled the film residues from 55 plastic-mulching croplands in subtropical areas of China but did not report the polymer types of these film residues. These studies can provide the characteristics of plastisphere communities and compare the results with those of the free-living communities. For further studies, other natural materials can be collected from the sampling sites, which would be helpful for studying the specific microbial species in the plastisphere. For the in situ incubation studies, microplastics with certain features can be selected. Therefore, in situ incubation studies using different polymers, shapes, or colors were frequently performed. For example, Pinnell and Turner [49] evaluated the microbial communities on conventional (polyethylene terephthalate [PET]) and biodegradable (polyhydroxyalkanoate [PHA]) microplastic substrates after incubation at the Laguna Madre lagoon in the northern Gulf of Mexico for 28 days. They intended to observe the distinct compositional structure between the biodegradable and conventional plastispheres. Wen et al. [50] studied the community structure and functional diversity of the microbial communities on microplastics of different colors by incubating the microplastics in a freshwater pond in the Yangtze Estuary, China. They reported that the bacterial community and structure of the plastisphere were plastic color-dependent. Additionally, the in situ incubation method is also used to compare the biofilm on microplastics with that on other natural substrates. Oberbeckmann et al. set up an in situ experiment with polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS) pellets and wooden beads along a coastal-to-estuarine gradient in the Baltic Sea, Germany [51]. However, this method requires sufficient time for biofilm growth, and it is not possible to maintain constant environmental conditions during the growing period. Thus, this method faces difficulties in quantifying the influences of environmental conditions on plastisphere characteristics. Additionally, to ensure the recovery of cultured microplastics, mesh bags are often used for the studies in aquatic environments. Recently, several studies also employed this method in terrestrial environments [28, 52-55]. For example, Zhu et al. [28] used nylon mesh bags (mesh size: 50 μm) as microplastic containers and buried them in the soil to investigate the microbial community of the soil plastisphere. However, this operation may introduce heterogeneity in the observed plastisphere as the contact distances between microplastic and soil particles in the system may differ. Even though in situ incubation has several limitations, the incorporation of the environmental conditions provides insights into the effects of realistic environmental variables on plastisphere communities. In comparison with the in situ incubation method, laboratory simulation experiments can study the influences of single or multiple environmental variables on the plastisphere characteristics under controlled conditions. Yang et al. [56] used a biofilm reactor to incubate a plastisphere under laboratory conditions and evaluate the effects of incubation time on the microbial community structure. Li et al. [44] reported that the soil pH, rather than heavy metals, showed a stronger influence on the plastisphere bacterial communities. However, this method has several limitations. One major concern is the microplastic concentration used in the laboratory incubation test. In principle, the laboratory incubation should maximumly simulate the field conditions. Therefore, the microplastic concentrations used in laboratory incubation should be similar to their environmental concentrations. However, even though all the published papers declared that the microplastic concentrations used in their studies were based on the detected concentrations, the values used are generally higher [57]. Moreover, it is unrealistic to perform experiments on time scales close to that experienced for microplastics in the real environment. For example, microplastics collected from marine environments or landfill sites may have aged for years [58]. It is nearly impossible to duplicate field processes in a laboratory setting, e.g., temperature, pH, redox, light intensity, and indigenous microorganisms. Laboratory simulations take advantage of controlled conditions, which significantly contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms shaping the plastisphere community. In our opinion, a combination of the above methods would be optimal for a comprehensive understanding of the formation of the plastisphere and the contributing factors. Imaging technologies, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and combinatorial labeling and spectral imaging-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CLASI-FISH), have demonstrated that the plastisphere can be a crowded, surface-based micro-ecosystem that includes a diverse range of microorganisms [59-61]. Over recent years, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have gained enormous popularity in the analysis of microbial communities [18, 19]. Most plastisphere microbiome surveys have used amplicon and metagenomic sequencing. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with the sequencing of the taxonomic marker gene can uncover the taxonomic profiles of microbial communities at low cost, marking this omnipresent in microbiome research (Figure 2). The 16S rRNA gene is the most common marker used for identifying bacterial communities in the plastisphere. Wang et al. used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to analyze the bacterial communities on microplastics collected from two urban rivers in China [62]. Ogonowski et al. explored the Baltic bacterioplankton and plastisphere by Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene libraries and reported substrate-driven selection [63]. In comparison, only a handful of studies have focused on eukaryotes in plastisphere communities [64-66]. By implementing internal transcribed spacer2 metabarcoding on plastic debris, De Tender et al. performed the first study to identify and characterize fungal genera on marine microplastics [67]. Although the second-generation sequencing technology has yielded substantial data concerning the plastisphere composition, it is still limited in the taxonomic resolution and coverage. This technology only produces short reads, forcing researchers to choose short barcoding regions and thus have a lower barcoding resolution [68]. Hence, long-read sequencing technology, such as the third-generation Pacific Biosystems SMRT and Oxford Nanopore sequencing, has been used in studying the plastisphere composition and provide improved classification of taxa [69, 70]. For instance, Davidov et al. identified 61 plastic-associated microorganisms at the species level from the Mediterranean Sea using DNA metabarcoding with Nanopore MinION [69]. Several studies have applied shotgun metagenomic sequencing to estimate the whole genomic DNA in the plastisphere [49, 71, 72], as this technology can simultaneously capture all the genetic material present in one sample and thus can show the taxonomic information across kingdoms and predict microbial functions. The first metagenomic study was performed by Jessica Bryant and colleagues in 2016 [73]. Following technical and analytical breakthroughs, multiomics, including metatranscriptomic, proteogenomic, and metabolomic approaches, have been used in recent studies to enable a comprehensive understanding of active members and acting functions of the plastisphere. These approaches can reveal the metabolic pathways active under different conditions and confirm the metagenomic functional predictions. Therefore, these methods have huge potential for analyzing the functional microorganisms in the plastispheres, such as potential microbes or enzymes for degrading plastics. For instance, Wright et al. used a combined proteogenomic and metabolomic approach to characterize the biodegradation and microbial community succession within the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastisphere [72]. Similarly, Wu et al. integrated metagenomic and metatranscriptomic technologies to evaluate the antibiotic resistomes in a laboratory-incubated plastisphere, demonstrating that the antibiotic resistomes in the plastisphere were not only present but also actively expressed. Future multiomic approaches will considerably contribute to deciphering the characteristics of the plastispheres and their roles in microbial-mediated biochemical transformations. The microbial community in the plastisphere has recently become an important research topic. Although diverse microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea, fungi, and other eukaryotes, can colonize microplastics, almost all current work is focused on bacterial communities. Community composition varies significantly across the soil, freshwater, and seawater plastisphere (Figure 3). Alpha-, Beta-, and Gamma-Proteobacteria are typical enriched in freshwater plastisphere communities [66, 75-77]. The seawater plastisphere community mainly comprises bacteria belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria (Alpha- and Gamma-) and to the Bacteroidetes [42, 78-80]. The vast majority of bacteria that colonize terrestrial plastics mainly belongs to the phyla Proteobacteria (Alpha-) and Actinobacteria [27, 47, 81-83]. The plastisphere community composition has been reported to significantly differ from that in the surrounding environment. Several studies even reported that certain microbial groups, i.e., members of Alpha-Proteobacteria (e.g., Rhodospirillaceae), were consistently found on plastics [62, 81, 84-86]. However, increasing numbers of studies found that the bulk of microorganisms colonizing plastics are likely the same as those colonize other surfaces. The concept that the plastisphere exhibits a unique microbial community has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. It has been well established that the vast majority of planktonic microbes that populate the water column (e.g., Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus species) strongly diverge from those able to associate and form biofilms [87-89]. Thus, unsurprisingly, the marine and freshwater plastisphere would exhibit distinct microbial communities in comparison with the bulk water community. In fact, biofilms can be observed on any surface in aquatic environments, from artificial surfaces, such as bottles [74], ship hulls [90], oil platforms [91], and other man-made items, to natural surfaces, such as animals, plants, zooplankton, micro/macro-aggregates, transparent exopolymer particles, and rocks [92]. Comparing the plastisphere with other biofilms in aquatic environments would be more critical for understanding the core unique microbial community in the plastisphere. But until now, only several plastisphere studies in aquatic environments include comparable control materials. For example, glass, ceramic, shells, or wood were used in previous studies to compare the plastisphere with other biofilms formed on other materials [22, 45, 63, 93]. No microorganisms occur only on plastics, and the relative abundance profiles of the major bacterial groups on different materials (i.e., conventional microplastics and ceramics) are substantially similar [19]. For soil microorganisms, increasing studies demonstrate that biofilm is the predominant mode of life, whereby microbial species colonize various substrates and interfaces, including mineral surfaces [94], pore spaces [95], and plant roots [96]. Microplastics can also provide a surface for the growth and proliferation of soil microorganisms. The analogous sessile lifestyles may be the reason that the abundant bacterial groups are similar in the soil plastisphere and bulk soil. The strongest differences in community structures between the plastisphere and the surrounding communities in both aquatic and terrestrial environments are commonly observed at the early stage of colonization [57]. For example, Ogonowski et al. [63] reported that the plastisphere on PE, PP, and PS microplastics was distinctly different from those on the nonplastic substrates (cellulose and glass beads) after 2 weeks of incubation in seawater under laboratory conditions. Alpha- (such as the Rhodobacteraceae) Gamma-proteobacteria, and Flavobacteria are among the initial colonizers in the plastisphere and are typical fast-growing opportunistic bacteria that can quickly respond to changes in the environment [97]. The surface properties of microplastics, including hydrophilicity, roughness, and electric charge, strongly affect the attachment of early microbial colonizers. Previous studies suggest that bacteria may preferentially colonize more hydrophilic surfaces, possibly due to the higher wettability and surface energies of these hydrophilic surfaces [61]. This could be why more intense biofilms are formed on more hydrophilic polymer surfaces [43]. Additionally, the high surface roughness of microplastics would supply more attachment points for microbes, and thus impact the microbial community composition at the early stage of the plastisphere [98]. Following the development of the plastisphere, the relative importance of substrates in shaping the microbial composition in the plastisphere declines. The environmental variables, such as temperature, salinity, pH, and nutrient content, influence the dynamic patterns of the microbial community in the plastisphere during the stages of development and maturation. For example, using a soil microcosm experiment with different microplastics under 15°C and 25°C, Sun et al. [27] reported that the temperature, rather than polymer type, significantly induced the differences between the plastisphere communities on PE and PLA microplastics. Wright et al. [99] estimated the global diversity of the plastisphere via a meta-analysis and reported that environmental variables have the largest impact on microbial composition. Currently, there remains no clear conclusion about how environmental variables influence plastisphere microbial communities. The prioritized environmental factors are also unknown. Leached compounds from microplastics, that is, plastic additives and plastic oligomers, can partly impact the assembly of microbial communities in the plastisphere [43, 61]. Significantly distinct communities have been observed on biodegradable and conventional microplastics [82, 83, 100, 101]. A potential reason may be that biodegradable microplastics supply a nutrient-rich environment compared with the conventional microplastics, thus recruiting copiotrophic microbes. Plastic additives may also influence the plastisphere communities as these artificial chemicals may promote or inhibit the biofilm growth. Overall, we may conclude that microplastic surface properties affect the stage of initial colonization, and that environmental factors and polymer inner characteristics play a critical role in the succession of the plastisphere. Interesting is growing in understanding the ecological mechanisms that drive the formation and maturation of the plastisphere. The application and examination of ecological theories to plastisphere microbial communities could build insights into when and how this microbial community structure changes through plastisphere life. Furthermore, understanding how plastisphere communities assemble over time is essential to understand changes in community diversity, species, and trait abundance, interactions between community members, and ultimately, the functional genes in the plastisphere. Theoretically, ecologists have proposed that four ecological and evolutionary processes, namely selection, dispersal, drift, and diversification, drive all principles in community ecology [102]. Two distinct theoretical lines have been debated to examine and interpret the community assembly: the niche-based theory and the neutral theory, which have been recently demonstrated to simultaneously drive community assembly [103, 104]. Several approaches have been used to obtain quantitative information on plastisphere community assembly, including quantifying assembly processes based on entire-community null model analysis (QPEN) [105] and infer community assembly mechanisms by phylogenetic-bin-based null model analysis [106] as well as normalized stochasticity ratio (NST) [107] and the Sloan neutral model [108]. Most studies suggested that stochastic processes dominantly drive the microbial community assembly on microplastics [22, 26]. For example, Sun et al. [20] used the null model, NST, and the neutral model to estimate the assembly processes of bacterial communities in a field-sampled aquatic plastisphere and found that the stochastic process of drift and dispersal limitation primarily contributed to the microbial community assembly. Studies on the soil plastisphere also indicated the dominant importance of neutral-based processes on microbial assembly [24, 27, 100, 109]. However, Li et al. [29] reported that the niche-based processes (deterministic) dominated the plastisphere community assembly as they observed low goodness-of-fit values for the neutral model of the plastisphere. These observations were ascribed to the heterogeneity of the microplastic samples. Many factors would influence the microbial assembly in the plastisphere. For instance, at the initial stage of colonization, the properties of the microplastic surface would impact the communities, and thus this selection will dominate the microbial assembly [100]. For the maturation stage of the plastisphere, the selection of microplastics may gradually decrease, and the importance of dispersal and drift would increase [100]. Parallelly, compounds that leach from microplastics may influence the composition of the plastisphere owing to microbial chemotaxis, which would further influence the assembly processes. Under the scenario that the plastisphere is sampled from large spatial areas, location-specific relationships may be obtained, and probably, the dominant roles of selection. Simultaneously, particle relocation occurs during the transportation of plastics or microplastics at local and global scales. Such a phenomenon can increase the uncertainty when estimating the plastisphere characteristics. More work is needed to quantitatively determine the importance of stochastic and deterministic processes in the microbial community assembly in the plastisphere. Whether or not the microorganisms in the plastisphere are degrading microplastics and contributing to the weight loss of plastics is an ongoing question. Several studies screened polymer-degrading microorganisms from the plastisphere [110, 111]. For instance, Delacuvellerie et al. [110] compared the structures of bacterial communities from floating plastics, sediment-associated plastics and sediments from the Mediterranean Sea and observed that hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria such as Alcanivorax, Marinobacter and Arenibacter genera are enriched with plastics, implying that these bacteria were potentially involved in plastic degradation. Multiomics has also been used for evaluating the plastic degradation by plastisphere communities. Jessica Bryant and colleagues used metagenomic sequencing to observe that several putative xenobiotic biodegradation genes were more abundant on plastic particles. However, these data only allow for speculation as to whether the microorganisms residing on plastic particles are actually degrading plastics. Bhagwat et al. [112] also observed the upregulation of PET hydrolysis-related enzyme genes in the plastisphere by using metagenomics, potentially suggesting plastic degradation. Through a combination of proteogenomic and metabolomic approach, Wright et al. characterized marine PET-degrading enzymes and compared the degradable ability of plastisphere on different PET plastics during 6 weeks of incubation in the marine environment [72]. They reported that degradation depends on the recalcitrance of the substrate (i.e., crystallinity) and the accessibility of the substrate to the microbes. The study clearly demonstrates the potential for PET degradation existing in the marine plastisphere. However, the biodegradation of highly recalcitrant plastics (e.g., PE, PP, and PS) by the plastisphere has seldom been reported. For example, with an integrated metagenomics and metaproteomics approach, Oberbeckmann et al. observed polymer-unspecific communities on PE and PS microplastics after 2 weeks of in situ incubation, but these plastics did not appear to be undergoing biodegradation [50]. Similarly, Delacuvellerie et al. [113] sampled PE and PP microplastics from the Mediterranean Sea, and used metagenomic and metaproteomic analysis to estimate the characteristics of the plastisphere. Despite the presence of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria was observed in the metagenomes, polymer degradation metabolism was not detected at the protein level. Therefore, whether plastispheres can degrade plastics seems to be closely related to the polymer types. PE, PP, and PS microplastics contain very stable backbones and are difficult to degrade, whereas PET, polyurethane, and polycarbonate are more susceptible to hydrolysis and to enzymes that catalyze the degradation. Further in-depth exploration with integrated genomics is warranted to estimate plastic biodegradation by the plastisphere. Plastisphere microorganisms are involved in functions related to elemental geochemical cycles. Pinnell and Turner observed the enrichment of adenylyl sulfate reductase and dissimilatory sulfite reductase genes in microorganisms on microplastics cultured at the sediment-interface of a coastal lagoon, suggesting the stimulation of sulfate reduction in the plastisphere [48]. Bryant et al. [73] found genes with significantly higher abundance among plastic-attached bacteria; these genes, such as nifH, suggest enrichment for nitrogen fixation in the plastisphere. Several studies provided substantive evidence that the plastisphere influences nitrogen cycling [114-116]. For instance, Su et al. [116] reported that plastisphere exhibits a higher denitrifying activity and N2O production than that in the surrounding bulk water, suggesting an overlooked N2O source. The plastisphere is more likely to recruit denitrifiers for colonization mainly because of the hypoxic conditions with the plastisphere and the denitrifiers utilize nitrate/nitrite as electron acceptors to sustain their metabolism [116]. Rahman et al. [117] performed a functional gene-array analysis of microbial communities on PET and PLA microplastics and found that genes involved in carbon degradation and fixation, nitrogen fixation and denitrification, and sulfur reduction were more abundant. Although a majority of these studies could not precisely estimate the plastisphere-induced changes in elemental flux, these results indicate that plastisphere can change the stability and function of the surrounding ecosystem. Considering the substantial plastic waste and microbial biomass, future research at a global scale is needed. The presence of various potential pathogens has been reported from environmental plastic samples around the worldwide. For instance, Vibrio species are usually reported in the marine plastispheres from both temperate and tropical marine environments [68, 118, 119], and Pseudomonas (e.g., Pseudomonas monteilii, P. mendocina, P. angilliseptica, and P. syringae) is observed in freshwater and soil plastispheres [101, 120, 121]. A previous study identified that the ratios of potential pathogens/bacteria in the plastisphere were higher than those in the soil [28]. Furthermore, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are frequently observed with the plastisphere in diverse environments [26, 35, 37, 56, 122]. For instance, Yang et al. [122] found that the abundance and diversity of ARGs in plastic microbiota were significantly greater than those in seawater microbiota in the North Pacific Gyre, which was the first report on ARGs in the plastisphere. Since this study, the roles of microplastics acting as reservoirs and refuges for ARGs are of increasing concern. As the bacteria in biofilms possess high diversity and metabolic complexity, the plastisphere is usually proposed to be a hotspot for horizontal gene transfer. Previous laboratory findings indicated that the frequency of plasmid transfer between plastic-associated bacteria was higher than that in free-living bacteria. The high level of gene changes would facilitate ARG propagation in the plastisphere. In addition, microorganisms embedded in the plastisphere are protected by extracellular polymeric substances and are more tolerant to the environmental stresses than the discrete cells. Thus, the acquisition of antibiotic tolerance by pathogens would be easier in the plastisphere, potentially presenting significant challenges for human health. However, reporting of microplastics as vectors for ARGs and potential pathogens should be taken with caution. Biofilms are often considered as natural reservoirs of ARGs and potential pathogens. Therefore, the higher durability, buoyancy, and transportability of microplastics compared with those of natural co-occurring materials should be highlighted. These properties would induce the plastisphere to pose a higher risk because of the prolonged exposure time and distances. To date, studies still cannot answer the question of whether microplastics specifically recruit potential pathogens and ARGs. Several other vital questions, such as whether horizontal gene transfer of ARGs into pathogens is more frequent and easier on microplastics and whether pathogens could transfer from microplastics to organisms under natural conditions, must be addressed by future studies. Compared with taxonomic diversity, the functional diversity of the plastisphere is considerably unexplored. Current functional predictions from sequencing methods revealed that diverse metabolic pathways exist in the plastisphere, potentially suggesting that the plastisphere community may participate in a large number of important ecological processes in the ecosystems. Multiple genes involved in xenobiotic degradation are enriched in the biofilm on microplastics and ARGs are frequently observed in plastisphere communities. However, importantly, few studies have shown the substantive evidence for the predicted functions. Multi-omic technologies, coupled with verification experiments, are needed in future studies. The contamination of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems with plastics is a global threat in the Anthropocene and shows no sign of decreasing in the near future. Understanding the assembly processes and the associated environmental impacts of the plastisphere is vital to managing and predicting the risks posed by plastic pollution. This review systematically summarizes the experimental methods to explore the plastisphere, the community composition and assembly processes, and the associated ecological functions. However, continued assessment and elaborate experimentation are required to answer the open questions in plastisphere research. Detailed information on microbial community succession during the early stages of the plastisphere is very limited. Biofilm communities on particle surfaces can be formed within several hours, however, few studies ventured into the formation and growth dynamics of early plastisphere communities. Traditional incubation and sequencing methods may not be suitable for tracking these processes. Microfluidic techniques can control structural and fluid behavior at the microscopic scale and can therefore simulate the heterogenous microenvironment between microplastics and the surrounding liquids. A combination of microfluidic devices and optical coherence tomography can provide valuable qualitative and quantitative information regarding the spatial structure of biofilms, which may be helpful for plastisphere studies. The key factors influencing the plastisphere communities are unclear. Diverse environmental factors, including hydrographic conditions, soil textures, nutrient availability, temperature, salinity, pH, and microplastic characteristics, such as polymer types, surface hydrophilicity, potential charges, and surface morphologies, can affect plastisphere communities. There is a knowledge gap in the underlying mechanisms whereby these factors drive the communities. Biological studies of the plastisphere have predominately focused on bacterial communities, whereas fungal and micro-eukaryotic communities are poorly understood. All these microorganisms play vital roles in plastisphere ecological processes and create complex interactions between neighboring cells. They can exhibit cooperative behaviors to enhance stress resistance and nutrient uptake. In parallel, competition is always pervasive in the plastisphere because of the space and resource limitations present. The diversity and variation of microbes in the plastisphere ensure that these interactions are always manifold and dynamic, further shaping community structure and function. We still lack the knowledge of how microorganisms interact with each other in the plastisphere, how they respond to environmental and microplastic properties, and how they drive the microbial functions in the plastisphere. Comprehensive methods, such as integrated genomics, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics, are needed for an in-depth understanding of the plastisphere and would facilitate the exploration of microbial diversity and functions to help reveal the molecular and ecological mechanisms and provide a holistic view of plastisphere. What we should notice is that these sequencing methods will unavoidably lead to errors. These errors may stem from the bioinformatic analysis, causing misalignment of short reads and mistakes in the genome assembly. Further studies should provide confirmatory evidence by culture-dependent methods about the functional processes that occur within the plastisphere, such as biodegradation and pathogenicity.

https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00685.x,The many faces of plant carbon relations: forging an ecophysiological identity in the age of human influence,"In 1972, Hal Mooney published a seminal paper that laid the foundation for the emerging field of plant physiological ecology and its focus on carbon assimilation (Mooney, 1972). Mooney argued that environmental and evolutionary constraints on plant growth could be best understood within the context of tradeoffs in the allocation of a limited supply of C among a variety of competing functions. To this day, concepts such as allocation tradeoffs, optimization, resource-use efficiency, marginal gain, storage and other econometrics that describe resource-use patterns have dominated ecophysiology. However, now, wider issues have come to the forefront and are driving change. In this issue of New Phytologist, three Tansley reviews are presented which, together, provide a window on the synthesis that has been going on between the more traditional, theory-based side of the discipline which was reflected in the econometric analogies of the 1960s−1980s, and the newer, societal-based side of the discipline that has emerged from the need to address major environmental issues since the 1980s. ‘For plant ecophysiology, the intellectual core represented by plant carbon relations still stands as a powerful organizing principle’ Ecophysiologists, with their focus on the assimilation and allocation of C, were ideally suited to lead some of the most important studies of environmental issues during the final decades of the 20th century: these included the ecological effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and the elevated concentration of pollutant oxidants, such as ozone (O3). Key symposium proceedings were published in the early 1980s (e.g. Miller, 1980; Lemon, 1983), defining the nexus between plant function and chemical changes in the atmosphere, with the list of invited contributors reflecting the most prominent leaders in the field of plant ecophysiology at that time. Now, 20 yr later, plant ecophysiologists represent a large portion of the intellectual leadership in the disciplines that cover biosphere–atmosphere interactions and the ecological effects of anthropogenic perturbations (DeLucia et al., 2001; Norby et al., 2001). This new, applied version of ecophysiology still rests firmly on its foundation of plant C relations, providing the basis for truly mechanistic perspectives on some of the hard environmental issues facing society today. Plants produce a variety of secondary compounds primarily for the purpose of protection from biotic and environmental stresses. When oxidized in the lower atmosphere, these volatile organic compounds (VOCs) exert primary photochemical controls over tropospheric chemistry (Monson & Holland, 2001; Monson, 2002). There is reason to believe that fundamental connections exist between evolutionary constraints on C allocation and the emission rate of some compounds (e.g. monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) and environmental constraints on C assimilation and the emission rate of other compounds (e.g. isoprene and methylbutenol). Such connections should facilitate the coupling of mechanistic photosynthesis models and growth/differentiation tradeoff models to the boundary processes that frame atmospheric chemistry models. The potential of this approach is profoundly synthetic in that it brings together communities of scientists from markedly disparate disciplinary perspectives, and expands C assimilation/allocation theory into a realm that includes issues such as tropospheric ozone production, the lifetime of radiatively active trace gases such as methane, and the production and transport of organic nitrate compounds such as peroxyacetyl nitrate. In a review of the most relevant biological issues on this topic, Lerdau & Gray (pp. 199–211) make clear the differences between VOCs that leak from stored reservoirs of herbivore-deterrent, secondary compounds, and VOCs that volatilize from primary metabolic processes. In physiological terms, these can be categorized as light-independent and light-dependent emissions, respectively. The authors discuss the implications of these different processes to the development of mechanistic emission models, emphasizing the fact that light-independent emissions must be simulated from biophysical processes involving compound solubility and diffusive potential, whereas light-dependent emissions must be simulated from biochemical processes associated with primary biosynthetic pathways; light-independent emissions are separated in time from their biosynthetic origins, whereas light-dependent emissions are tightly coupled in time to their biosynthetic origins. In this analysis, the independent functional ramifications and time constants of C allocation vs C assimilation are clear. Of particular note in the review is the evolutionary perspective on the distribution of certain types of emission, especially those involving methylbutenol, a recently discovered light-dependent VOC emission from certain North American pine species. Using new information on the distribution of methylbutenol emissions, the authors highlight the complex, discontinuous pattern of expression among existing pine clades, leading to the conclusion of numerous independent origins or losses; the phylogenetic situation is similar for the case of isoprene emissions, the dominant form of light-dependent VOC emission found in a broad spectrum of plant taxa, ranging from mosses to angiosperms. They highlight the recent breakthroughs in sequencing terpene synthases, including isoprene synthase, and the potential to add insight into phylogenetic patterns. This is clearly an area for exploitation in the future. One of the big questions remaining in regard to the ecophysiological significance of VOC emissions is the reason for their existence, adaptive or otherwise. One theory that has gained some acceptance in the community involves the possible thermal protective properties of short-chain hydrocarbons that partition into lipid membranes (Sharkey & Yeh, 2001). By stabilizing critical proteins in the photosynthetic apparatus or in other membranes, VOCs such as isoprene may enhance thermal tolerance. Other theories exist to explain these emissions, however, and to date, no single theory has completely captured the discipline (Kreuzwieser et al., 2002; Penuelas & Llusia, 2002; Rennenberg & Schnitzler, 2002). Sometime between the early and late Carboniferous period, at least 450 million years ago, terrestrial plants faced a reckoning with the atmosphere – CO2 concentrations were depleted to the point where photorespiration became a significant C cost and stomata were forced to open to the point where photosynthetic water-use efficiency emerged as a dominant selective agent (Drake, 2001; Medlyn et al., 2001; Morison, 2001). Using the econometric analogies alluded to already, this was the ‘ultimate financial depression’, a time when previously evolved C investment and allocation strategies were put to the true test. Following the decreases in CO2 concentration, and during subsequent secondary decreases, novel mechanisms of C assimilation and allocation evolved, including C4 photosynthesis and active phloem loading (Turgeon, 1996; Sage, 1999; Pataki, 2002). In modern times, the potential fortunes for plants have changed again, with the earth's atmosphere returning toward a state of more abundant CO2. In the recent world, marked by profligate fossil fuel combustion and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations, many plants stand to benefit. The obvious question arises, which plants will benefit the most? In other words, what will determine the winners and losers in the competition to capitalize on the sudden increased availability of atmospheric C? In the review by Poorter and Navas (pp. 175–198), the highly successful method of growth analysis that was pioneered by Poorter and coworkers to address the question ‘why do some plants grow faster than others?’ is now applied to the question ‘why do some plants grow faster in elevated CO2 than others’. In many ways, this top-down approach defies the tendencies that developed immediately following Mooney's 1972 paper (i.e. the tendency to focus on processes on the basis of a unit of ‘leaf’, rather than a unit of ‘whole plant’). Poorter & Navas take the latter approach (Saxe et al., 2001; Jablonski et al., 2002). Using a meta-analysis of 350 experiments in which plant responses to elevated CO2 were studied, Poorter & Navas try to explain high-CO2 growth enhancement that ranges from 30% to 300%. Only 18% of the total variance in this response could be explained using species as a random factor – in other words, 82% of the total variance was due to factors other than interspecific variability. Using statistically based models, they show that a large portion of the variance is due to plant-to-plant variation in relative growth rate (i.e. intraspecific variation). There is an important experimental message here – the sampling protocols of most past studies have been inadequate to characterize the true species mean. However, there is also a more fundamental message – intraspecific variability in growth rate is relatively unexplored as an important component in the ecophysiological response of plants to their environment. Clear patterns emerged from the Poorter & Navas analysis with regard to functional groups, and certain traits appeared to correlate more strongly with an enhanced growth response to elevated CO2. In general, C4 plants exhibit less of a growth response to elevated CO2 than C3 plants; this conclusion has been lodged in the ecophysiological conventional wisdom for some time now, but Poorter & Navas provide synthetic validation across an unprecedented number of independent studies. The trait most able to predict a species’ growth response to elevated CO2, whether present in herbaceous or woody species, is the inherent relative growth rate (i.e. species with the highest growth rates in normal CO2 exhibited the strongest growth response to elevated CO2). Presumably, genetic controls over traits such as short cell-cycle time, which underlie rapid growth rates, also facilitate maximum capacities for utilizing increased C assimilation rates. With the correlational framework provided by the Poorter & Navas study, the stage is set for mechanistic probes into the underlying causes of differences in relative growth rate, and thus differences in the response to elevated CO2. The oxidative power of the lower atmosphere is ultimately determined by the tropospheric O3 concentration. It is tropospheric O3 that photolyzes in the presence of UV-B radiation, causing the production of oxidative radical species, such as the hydroxyl radical and hydroperoxide radical, which ultimately drive oxidative photochemistry to form more O3. Basically, ‘it takes a little O3 to make a lot more O3’. The tropospheric O3 concentration has been increasing for several decades (Brasseur et al., 1999). This trend is traceable to human activities, particularly the emission of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides during the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass burning. The increase in tropospheric O3 has caused significant detriment to the primary productivity of agricultural and natural ecosystems (Furher, 2002). In a review that emphasizes physiological processes, Andersen (pp. 213–228) makes clear the fact that O3 disrupts the assimilation of C in leaves, as a primary effect, and thus decreases the supply of C to roots, as a secondary effect. In leaves, O3 is known to cause reductions in stomatal conductance and to damage photosynthetic membranes and proteins. In causing secondary leaf responses, O3 damage induces the increased use of carbohydrates to repair damage, synthesize antioxidant compounds and compensate for tissue loss (O3 is also known to inhibit phloem transport, although the causal mechanisms are still unclear). The net result of O3-induced inhibition to these leaf-focused processes is to reduce the rate of carbohydrate transport to below-ground tissues, causing concomitant reductions in root biomass and root carbohydrate storage pools. Andersen spends a considerable portion of his review discussing the potential ramifications of decreased carbohydrate transport to roots on higher–order below-ground interactions, including infection by mycorrhizal fungi, decomposition of leaf litter and integrated connections in soil food webs. Very little research has actually been done on the effects of O3 on these interactions, so Andersen takes the approach of synthesizing fundamental research on the processes that compose the interactions, with clearly articulated hypotheses about the anticipated effect of elevated O3 concentrations. Basic principles underlying C allocation and source–sink dynamics can be used as a predictive framework in this regard, providing the basis for broadly synthetic predictions with wide-ranging ecophysiological effects. It is clear from Andersen's review that synthetic approaches, founded on the economics of C relations, are likely to yield large dividends in the study of the effects of O3, a field that has been hampered by disparate results with few central organizing principles. As an example, consider the issue as to how the formation of mycorrhizas is influenced by, and in turn influences, plant responses to elevated O3. Intuitively, decreases in the rate by which carbohydrates are transported to roots should, in turn, decrease the potential for infection by mycorrhizal fungi. However, Andersen points out that numerous studies have shown an increase in mycorrhizas under O3 stress, although it tends to be a transitory increase. Andersen offers the hypothesis that the transient increase is due to a short-term pulse in the availability of root carbohydrate reserves to mycorrhizal fungi immediately after initiation of the O3 stress. According to the hypothesis, this pulse is an expected response if decreased carbohydrate transport to roots causes the down-regulation of hexose metabolism genes in roots, but the mobilization of root carbohydrate reserves remains constant, or increases. This example makes clear the potential for integrated plant C relations to explain what might otherwise appear to be distinct O3-induced processes (inhibition of photosynthesis and stimulation of mycorrhizas) mitigated by separate above- and below-ground responses. As biology becomes more complex and fractured into subdisciplines, synthetic approaches are all the more needed and appreciated. No field has grown and fractured more than plant ecophysiology – in the mere 30 yr since its emergence from a core of concepts involving plant C and water relations, the field finds itself now as a sphere of widely displaced boundaries, often with little semblance of a core. Ecophysiologists have diffused upward in large numbers to fill mechanistic needs in the fields of biogeochemistry and global earth systems, and downwards to explain the functional significance of sequenced and mapped genes in the fields of genomics and molecular systematics. The societal needs in these areas are immense and pressing, leading to unprecedented funding opportunities for scientists in all disciplines. The intellectual domain of a discipline, however, is only capable of stretching so far as these opportunities are pursued. In the case of plant ecophysiology, the intellectual core represented by plant C relations still stands as a powerful organizing principle, capable of stimulating well articulated foundations upon which some of the most recent, state-of-the-art syntheses can occur. Future progress in deciphering the mechanistic underpinnings of earth processes and their relationship to human-driven change will no doubt receive considerable benefit from intuitive, well-tested concepts that were pioneered during the formative phases of plant ecophysiology.",W2077960986,True,0.987467348575592
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2023.11.006,Non-additive effects of multiple predators alter the biological control of the coffee leaf miner (Leucoptera coffeella),"Although most prey are attacked by multiple predators, much ecological theory on prey suppression focuses on the effects of a single predator. The presence of multiple predators can lead to complex effects such as trait-mediated interactions (TMIIs) and intraguild predation which can influence the suppression of pest populations. Here we explore the effect of two predators, a native anole lizard species Anolis cristatellus (Squamata: Dactyloidae) and a non-native ant species Wasmannia auropunctata (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), on the coffee leaf miner, Leucoptera coffeella (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae) (CLM). In a laboratory experiment we examined the effects of these two predators in isolation and when co-occurring. Our results show that when each predator is alone, they are able to consume the CLM in a comparable way. However, when they are together, their effect is not greater than when alone. This indicates that there is a negative effect when both predators co-occur. The results from this experiment have practical implications since both predators are present in coffee agroecosystems in Puerto Rico, where the CLM is considered the main insect pest. Furthermore, these results demonstrate the potential dynamics among several predators in agroecosystems and the potential implications for herbivore regulation.",W4388948536,True,0.9941703081130981
https://doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.1809,Farmers' delivery of floral resources: to “bee” or not to “bee”,"Agriculture is the most widespread use of land on Earth and one of the greatest drivers of biodiversity loss (Green et al., 2019). In the contiguous United States, over half of the land is devoted to agricultural production (NASS, 2021). Globally, simplified and intensively managed agricultural landscapes have replaced diverse farming systems, reducing biodiversity and ecosystem services essential to agricultural production such as pollination, pest control, and soil health (Le Provost et al., 2020). Understanding how land use can optimize both biodiversity and food security is essential to halting the negative environmental impacts of increasingly intensive use of agricultural land. To address this challenge, we propose a research approach that integrates landscape-scale remotely sensed data with trait information of wild and crop plants. This integrative framework generates multiscalar (field to landscape) depictions of agroecological outcomes (yield and biodiversity) associated with a particular land-use context. We apply this approach (Box 1 and Figure 1) to pollinators, providers of vital ecosystem services to both crops and wild plants (Kremen et al., 2007), by linking land use to both pollinator health and crop yield. 1. Define study area: Using open-source rasterized land use data, such as the USDA CropScape data set, identify the type of land-use in the region of interest (e.g., specific crops, semi-natural and natural habitat). 2(A). Quantify floral resources in the field: Collect field data from randomly sampled transects across the agricultural landscape by measuring traits on a plant such as nectar volume and sucrose concentration on a sample of flowers, quantify the number of flowers on a plant across the season to provide a temporal component, then determine biomass and density of plants. 2(B). Quantify indicators of environmental health: Sample response variables (abundance and diversity of pollinators) of each land-use patch using randomized standard sampling methods. These samples are taken simultaneously with sampling of floral resources (2A). 3. Geospatially anchor floral resource information to generate the floral resource landscape: Number of flowers are typically highly correlated with the size of the plant. Plant biomass combined with plant density can then be used to predict caloric resources on higher scales (e.g., plots in a field, fields, and landscapes within a given radius of the sample). Thus, for each land-use category, generate a distribution of plant density based on observed field observations. From plant density, project anticipated floral resources on each pixel based on relationships derived from field observations. The floral resources landscape is predicted through regression analyses: temporal and spatial distribution of floral resources = measurements of individual plants across the flowering phenology (number of flowers) and floral resources (nectar, pollen) weighted by crop or wild plant densities. Floral resource information (nectar volume and sugar concentration) for plant and crop species is also accessible from large-scale open-source data sets (e.g., Kattge et al., 2020). 4. Link agroecological outcomes to the floral resource landscape: Link response variables (crop yield, wild-plant seed production, pollinators) to the floral resource landscape. Estimate wild and crop yield based on fertile seed count from a random sample of focal individuals within each land-use type or this information can be accessed by yield estimations from county-wide U.S. Department of Agriculture yield data (if available for the region) or by remotely sensed vegetative proxies (Brogi et al., 2020). Thus, for every point in the landscape, one can predict (using regression approaches) the relationship between floral resources and agroecological outcomes based on survey information of floral resources provided by different plants and their densities and the agroecological parameters of interests. 5. Simulate optimized landscapes: How might land-use reconfiguration shift outcomes based on the estimated parameters? Link spatiotemporal composition and distribution of floral resources in an agricultural landscape with landscape indicators of biodiversity (Koh et al., 2016) and county-scale yield data. Thus, policy makers can identify scenarios of land-use composition and configuration at the landscape scale that minimize biodiversity loss while supporting agricultural and wildflower production (1B). Agriculture reconfigures the spatiotemporal distribution of wild and crop plants, that affects important ecological drivers of agricultural production: pollinator services and pollinator health (Hellerstein et al., 2017). Quantifying the distribution and composition of floral resources in agricultural landscapes allows us to understand the interactions between agricultural land use, pollinator health, and agricultural outcomes. Depending on the distribution and availability of floral resources across the landscape, pollinator diversity and abundance is promoted or depressed (Schulte et al., 2017). Thus, we focus on the resources (or interaction currencies that mediate pollinator–plant interactions, Kissling et al., 2012) directly related to the energetic requirements of pollinators (Heinrich and Raven, 1972), that is, the density of sugar resources or kilocalories per hectare. By classifying the landscape based on resources available to pollinators, we can reduce complexities such as plant species composition, competition, or facilitation among pollinators and or plants into a single parameter that has great explanatory power for community-level processes (Nottebrock et al., 2017). Reducing the landscape to a map of available resources may more easily contribute to land-use decisions that both improve pollinator nutrition and enhance pollination services to agricultural systems. As depicted in Figure 1 and Box 1, we generate floral resource maps by linking field measurements of floral resources such as nectar and pollen with land-use categories derived yearly for the continental United States from remotely sensed data that is compiled into matrices (rasters) of pixels where each pixel value represents a land-use category (e.g., USDA CropScape). Land-use categories correspond to land planted with different crops (e.g., corn, soybean, fallow) or non-crops (e.g., herbaceous wetlands, grasslands) and are georeferenced satellite imagery with moderate resolution (30–50 m) and extensive agricultural ground truthing. Floral resource maps should reflect the composition of crops, field margins, and non-crop areas. CropScape does not provide species composition for non-crop areas that consist of native and non-native plants. Thus, the density of floral resources that specific non-crop plants provide need to be quantified within each locale. The quantity of floral resources provided by each land-use category for pollinators can then be assigned simplified energetic resource values (kcal/ha). Each land-use type at a geospatial location is also linked with field measurements of agroecological outcomes, e.g., crop yields and pollinator diversity and abundance. By linking the different categories of land use to the amount of floral rewards for each land use collected from field surveys, we can estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of floral resources on the landscape. We can then link this distribution of land-use types with key agroecological outcomes (i.e., crop yield and pollinator health) across landscapes covered by different combinations of crop, natural and semi natural environments. Because we are integrating across individuals to generate predictions of pollinator resources (ecosystem function) at a given scale, we call this individual trait surface a floral resource landscape. Landscape-level analyses matter not only for ecological outcomes but also for the formulation of best farming practices. For example, Stiles et al. (2021) demonstrated that increased landscape diversity (measured as Shannon's diversity index with land use quantified in CropScape) in the South Dakota Prairie Coteau (a roughly 50,000-km2 plateau that rises from the flat prairies of western Minnesota and eastern South Dakota) resulted in higher pollinator diversity and higher yield in experimental plots of the new oil crop, Brassica carinata. Thus, landscape-level management that increases pollinator diversity could increase farmers' net profitability by replacing costs associated with inputs such as tillage and neonicotinoid seed treatments. Similarly, analyses at the national level find that more diverse agricultural landscapes are associated with significantly higher yields of the major crops (Nelson and Burchfield, 2021). While there are an increasing number of studies demonstrating that both ecological outcomes and the economic interests of farmers can be simultaneously optimized (e.g., Dainese et al., 2019), the resource landscape approach may enhance our mechanistic understanding of how shifts in land-use composition and configuration iteratively alter key coupled agricultural and ecological outcomes. The floral resource landscape approach can generate the necessary information about where and how we need to improve the availability and distribution of floral resources in the agricultural landscape to improve pollinator services and environmental health. Since pollinator health is correlated to landscape attributes that generally enhance biodiversity (Kremen et al., 2007), our landscape resource approach may reveal the relationship between landscape use and other biodiversity driven ecosystem services. We acknowledge that diverse resources are also important to sustain the biodiversity of pollinators, in addition to our proposal of the simple measure of kilocalories per hectare. Different pollinators do not necessarily forage on the same plants, and different plant species produce pollen and nectar of different nutritive values that can differentially affect pollinator health. We suggest that plant diversity, including crop and non-crop species, may be used as a proxy for resource diversity. Since pollinator services to crops depend on pollinator access to natural habitat for foraging and nesting (Kremen et al., 2007), models to assess pollinator services to crops should also assess aspects of landscape diversity and plant diversity, including the contribution of natural areas. However, the novelty and advantage of quantifying floral resources is that this approach reduces a complex landscape to a relatively easily measurable parameter that can be compared across spatial and temporal scales and plays an intuitively important role in pollinator health. For example, in our studies of pollinators communities found in remnant grasslands of the Prairie Coteau, landscape composition surrounding the sampling sites did predict pollinator diversity, but the sugar resources at the site were a better predictor of pollinator diversity and plant–pollinator interactions (Vilella-Arnizaut et al., 2021 [Preprint]). Since landscape use and their policy drivers are so important, we suggest that the floral resource landscape is, at the very least, a valuable informative parameter in addition to other measures of landscape diversity that have been previously studied. Because humans are directly responsible for the composition of agricultural and surrounding semi-natural landscapes (i.e., humans as keystone species; Moll et al., 2021), increasing the sustainability of these landscapes requires further understanding of the underlying political and economic factors that shape land-use decisions. The research approach described here can be used by policy makers to optimize biodiversity and food security. For example, in the United States, land use is strongly influenced by U.S. agricultural policy, particularly the U.S. Farm Bill, which is the major policy mechanism driving how and where food is produced and how land is used in the United States (Spangler et al., 2020). Federally subsidized crop insurance reduces the risk of bringing new, predominantly marginal land into production (Lark et al., 2015), which has contributed to declines in agrobiodiversity (Aguilar et al., 2015) and ecological health (West and Six, 2007), causing concern for the sustainability and viability of crop production. Sustainable landscapes can then become additional targets for policy changes to enhance regenerative farming practices and ecosystem services that include maintaining pollinator diversity and abundances. The individual-trait-based landscape approach that we advocate can be used to optimize the construction of sustainable landscapes by quantifying how land use affects the configuration and complexity of floral resources. Changes as simple as increasing the number of crops eligible for crop insurance, including native grasses for biofuels in the crop insurance program, or increasing funding per acre of land transferred to the Conservation Reserve Program would make for a more sustainable agricultural landscape. Furthermore, the social factors, such as adherence to different measures of the U.S. Farm Bill at a county or finer scale, can be overlaid on the previous geospatial data to directly relate social behaviors with land use and ecosystem function and services. To summarize, the novelty and advantage of quantifying floral resources is that they can be integrated with other landscape descriptors, including landscape composition, diversity, and configuration, and related to agricultural policy driving human choices to provide a roadmap to environmental sustainability.

Thousands of practitioners in hundreds of institutions around the world make idiosyncratic decisions about which questions to study, which organisms to use, and for how long, guided by a combination of individual predilection, inspiration from journals and books, and exchanges of progress reports and discussion at professional meetings. No synod of presbyters sets priorities, and no court of sagacious elders adjudicates disputes over which theory is the better explanation for a collection of data. From this swirling mix, principles form and a body of knowledge emerges. These are then collected into monographs and textbooks whose consistency might seem little short of miraculous, given the process. As in many academic disciplines, the epistemic basis of ecology and evolutionary biology, the set of principles and facts that we believe to be true, is the cumulative result of a remarkable self‐organizing process.Ecology and evolutionary biology are not focused on the uniform behavior of fundamental particles but on fundamental processes that unfold in a variety of contexts from a variety of histories. In that light, the most critical decision in the inquiry portion of our science is the match of question to organism (or system). That is, within this self‐organizing enterprise, how do we choose which organisms to employ to answer a question or, conversely, which questions to ask of a specific organism? If our epistemic basis is the cumulative result of these choices, then the principles and facts that emerge will be only as reliable as our choices have been wise.Here I explore how the decision to match organism to question influences what we believe to be so. In the first section, I take the pragmatic perspective of a working scientist and describe how we make the match. In the next section, I take a more formal perspective, following in part the work of Burian (1993), and describe how we should make the match; that is, I outline the criteria that ought to guide our decisions. In the final section, I explore how closely what we actually do approaches what we should do and discuss whether certain facets of our discipline warrant closer attention to the process by which we match organism to question and, thereby, derive what we believe to be so.How Do We Match Question and Organism?For many scientists, the organism leads to the question. This path is most likely when we observe some of nature's most striking phenomena, such as the synchronous mass flowering of south Asian bamboo (Keeley and Bond 1999) or the curious jugular location of the anus in pirate perch, Aphredoderus sayanus (Fletcher et al. 2004). We ask why something out of the ordinary has emerged; when we encounter mass flowering in bamboo, our first thought is not ""I wonder what the specific leaf area of these plants might be,"" nor do we observe pirate perch and wonder immediately whether the population's superoxide dismutase gene shows extensive variation.Many of us work from organism to question in more routine contexts. That is, we make an observation that interests us and then direct our questions to it. Followed faithfully, this approach usually leads to research that crosses lines between subdisciplines and often leads to some striking discoveries about the organism. For example, the work that my colleagues, students, and I performed on sailfin mollies Poecilia latipinna began when Jim Farr and I noticed that molly populations varied widely in their body size distributions and that closely adjacent populations sometimes had extremely different distributions (fig. 1). We were not the first to notice this pattern, of course (see Kilby 1955; Hubbs 1964; Snelson 1985), but we were the most tenacious in our desire to explain it. Our subsequent studies embraced behavior (Farr et al. 1986; Farr and Travis 1986; Travis and Woodward 1989; Ptacek and Travis 1996), life history (Farr and Travis 1989; Travis et al. 1989; Trexler and Travis 1990; Trexler et al. 1990), demography (Trexler et al. 1992, 1994), population genetics (Trexler 1988), reproductive biology (Trexler 1985; Travis 1989), mating system (Travis et al. 1990; Sumner et al. 1994; Ptacek and Travis 1997; Trexler et al. 1997), and physiological ecology (McManus and Travis 1998). The work revealed several striking phenomena, including facultative matrotrophy (Trexler 1985), spontaneous ovarian cycling (Travis 1989), an olfactory cue for female receptivity (Sumner et al. 1994), and Y‐linked inheritance of male body size (Travis 1994).Figure 1: Some of the animals, plants, and places involved in my own research.

Hypotheses for even the most striking observations are usually guided by theory; Janzen's 1976 essay is a masterful application of existing life‐history theory to the mass flowering of bamboo. In fact, organism‐inspired research often leads to new theory; with the passage of time, mass flowering turned out to be but one example of a broader phenomenon of synchronous reproduction, and theory aimed at that phenomenon followed accordingly (review in Ims 1990). In our molly work, although the initial question might appear agnostic to theory except in its broadest sense, the theory of local adaptation, many of the individual investigations relied heavily on existing mathematical theory for developing specific, testable hypotheses (Reznick and Travis 2001).Alternatively, the question can lead to the organism, in any of three ways. First, we may choose to employ a model system, such as Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Zea mays, or Arabidopsis thaliana, to study a problem. Model systems may be the only practical choice for problems such as mutation accumulation (Mukai et al. 1972; Fry et al. 1999; Shaw et al. 2000; Baer et al. 2005), and they are often a convenient choice for a novel approach to a conceptual question (Travisano et al. 1995; Joshi et al. 2003). Model systems offer a faster and more forgiving path for an intricate study of a general problem that can be addressed in any of many systems—at least in principle—but can be addressed more quickly or more extensively with the model system. Several excellent programs have taken this path; among them are Mueller's studies of evolution in response to density (Mueller et al. 2000), the scrutiny of the genetic response to selection on a quantitative trait conducted by Mackay and colleagues (Mackay 2001), and the exploration of adaptation to thermal regimes led by Lenski and Bennett (Cullum et al. 2001).Model systems reveal what can happen in nature but not necessarily what does happen. In this light, studies with model systems guide those of us who work with natural populations to consider what might have happened in nature and what the alternative happenings might have been. Studies with model systems have also facilitated the development of methods and techniques that can be applied to natural populations so that we can better understand what does happen in nature. This ""technology transfer"" has been especially fruitful for large‐scale evolutionary studies with Drosophila that have helped us learn not just from model systems but also about them. Examples include the scrutiny of variation in life history (Coyne and Beecham 1987), morphology (Mezey and Houle 2005), physiology (David and Bocquet 1975; Gilchrist and Huey 2004), biochemistry (Oakeshott et al. 1982), host‐pathogen relationships (Jaenike and Perlman 2002), convergent evolution (Balanyà et al. 2003), isolating mechanisms (Coyne and Orr 1997; Noor 1997), and genetic responses to global climate change (Etges and Levitan 2004; Umina et al. 2005).The second path from question to organism emerges when a sound test of theory requires a system whose features match important theoretical assumptions and a scientist with a strong natural‐history background recognizes the propriety of a particular organism or system. The work of Wilbur (1972) and Morin (1983, 1986) with amphibians on the interaction of predation and resource competition in community ecology is a clear example. Their deep knowledge of natural history is implicit in this work and was vital to its success; not only did they recognize the propriety of the systems, but they were adept at creating realistic experimental conditions in which the organisms could grow and develop as they do in nature.The third way in which the question leads to the organism occurs when a particular theory unifies seemingly disparate phenomena and, in effect, tells us to look more widely for patterns that we would not otherwise have sought. Charnov's work on the evolution of sex allocation (synthesized in Charnov 1982) is an excellent example. Charnov offered a general theory that applied to sex ratios in gonochoristic animals, the circumstances under which hermaphrodites could displace gonochores, the allocation to male and female function in simultaneous hermaphrodites, and the way optimal allocation to gender function in sequential hermaphrodites should vary with age or size. This work helped inspire a host of empirical studies in a diversity of systems (e.g., Ashman and Baker 1992; Peterson and Fischer 1996; Roy et al. 2003), and sex allocation theory remains a vibrant topic (see, e.g., Pen and Weissing 1999; Sakai 2000; Cadet et al. 2004).Finally, as individual careers progress, some of us change the questions we ask of the organisms we study, and some of us change the organisms we use to address a particular question. We do so, as Burian (1993) describes, when our curiosity about an organism leads us to new questions or when we approach the limits to an organism's utility for a particular question. Bradshaw's work on pitcher‐plant mosquitoes Wyeomyia smithii traces an arc from his early studies of mutualism between arthropods and pitcher plants (Bradshaw and Creelman 1984) through studies of life history (Bradshaw 1986) to his recent work on hourglass timers and the regulation of circadian and annual rhythms (Bradshaw et al. 2003). Conversely, Huey's work on thermal ecology and the evolution of thermal response moved from a focus on lizards (Huey and Bennett 1987) to the employment of a model system, Drosophila melanogaster (Gilchrist et al. 1997), to a scrutiny of thermal effects on adaptation in natural populations of Drosophila subobscura (Gilchrist and Huey 2004).In rare cases, some of us take the opportunity late in our careers to return to particular questions about specific organisms on which we focused years before, in order to resolve the outstanding issues. Sometimes this return is facilitated by new technology or methods and sometimes by altered personal circumstances. Perhaps the best example is Hairston's remarkable studies of how competition and predation affect the distribution and abundance of plethodontid salamanders; the experimental studies in the latter part of his career (Hairston 1980a, 1980b, 1983, 1986) were separated from the observational studies of his early years (Hairston 1949, 1951) by a rich vein of diverse ecological work (Hairston 1958, 1959, 1967, 1969; Hairston et al. 1960; Hairston and Kellerman 1964, 1965; among many others).How Should We Match Question to Organism?Two general considerations ought to dictate how we choose our organisms, that is, how we match question to organism. First, we should choose on the basis of ""suitability,"" which describes the quality of the reciprocal match of question and organism (Burian 1993). Second, we should take into account that, to borrow again from Burian (1993), the fundamental epistemology of ecology and evolutionary biology is comparative. That is, we can discover what is general only from a broad set of comparisons, and we can often understand the special case only through its relationship to the general pattern. I explore each of these considerations in turn.SuitabilityFollowing Burian (1993), we claim that a specific organism or study system is suitable for a particular question if it fulfills two requirements. First, the organism or system must be tractable for the question; that is, we must be able actually to find it and work with it. This requirement is familiar to every practicing ecologist or evolutionary biologist, and we often take great pains to assure reviewers of grant proposals that indeed we can work with a particular organism. Model systems are created when an extremely tractable organism is discovered to have peculiar but interesting properties; many organisms are easy to raise in the laboratory, but the ability to identify and delineate cell lineages made C. elegans the nematode of choice.The second requirement is that the question actually be relevant for the organism. Burian (1993, p. 353) states it slightly differently, asking ""whether the model [here the organism or system] is faithful in relevant ways to that for which it is supposed to serve as a model."" In the simplest case, we can ask whether the organism or system meets the assumptions of the theory or concept under consideration; for example, Morin (1983, 1986) selected his anuran prey and their predators because they exhibited the properties that the theory under scrutiny took as fundamental assumptions, so his system was suitable for his purpose. In a deeper case, we can ask directly whether the question itself applies to the organism. For example, the interpretation of an experimental study of the adaptive significance of cannibalism in an animal is open to question if no evidence suggests that the animal engages in cannibalism in nature. We could raise this question in many other contexts, from mate copying (Is the mating system such that copying is possible?) to predator functional responses (Do predators or parasitoids show density‐dependent attack rates in the natural range of densities?); Gunzburger and Travis (2005) have questioned the interpretation of many reports of unpalatability of tadpoles because the tadpoles were offered to predators that rarely, if ever, encounter them in nature.In a subtle variation, we can ask whether the experimental treatments employed to test a concept create a misleading result; that is, the question may apply, but the design and execution of the experiment may create artificial conditions that can bias the outcome in a particular direction. Expressed yet another way, the question applies but the experiment does not. For example, Jaeger and Walls (1989) criticized experimental studies of anuran populations and communities conducted in enclosures or mesocosms (large tanks set up as artificial ponds) because, among other reasons, the experiments up to that time had employed densities far higher than were measured in nature. The concern was that such experiments could not help but implicate an important role for biotic interactions in this system, a role that may not be fulfilled at lower, presumably more natural densities. Subsequent experiments at much lower densities (e.g., Warner et al. 1991, 1993; Gascon and Travis 1992) revealed the same effects seen in the earlier studies but found, indeed, that the strength of the biotic effects had previously been overestimated.Suitability of an organism has two important features. First, suitability can be specific to a particular context (Zallen 1993). Sailfin mollies in north Florida have proved suitable for studies of sexual selection and mating‐system variation but not for numerical dynamics; the effects of tidal fluctuations in salt marshes and the physical structure of these habitats precluded reliable sampling for population densities. Working in the Everglades, however, Trexler and his colleagues have found sailfin mollies quite suitable subjects for studying numerical dynamics, among other topics (Trexler et al. 2002).Second, the suitability of a system for a question may change as other questions are addressed and answered in the system. For example, the genetic control of pattern variation in Papilio dardanus offers important insights into the origin of mimicry, but the full utility of this system became apparent only after Nijhout's work on the developmental biology of lepidopteran wings (Nijhout 2002, 2003). The value of protein variation within many fish species for studying the genetic basis of adaptive variation improved dramatically when sophisticated methods for determining protein structure at a very fine scale were developed, along with the ability to determine the detailed sequence and structure of the genes involved (see Hochachka and Somero 2002). Suitability need not always improve; the discovery of reciprocal chromosome translocations in Oenothera lamarckiana compromised its suitability as a system for illustrating the constraints on the response to selection on quantitative traits (Provine 1971).Recognizing the Comparative Nature of Our EpistemologyThe comparative nature of our epistemology dictates three principles that ought to guide our collective choice of organisms.A well‐sampled spectrum is necessary for understanding diversity and defining generalities. To be specific, a well‐sampled spectrum serves to define the most common patterns and processes and identify the circumstances through which less common patterns and outcomes emerge. Of course, morphologists have known and applied this principle for centuries; understanding peculiar anatomical variations such as the fangs of venomous snakes or the toothless gape of egg‐eating specialist snakes requires appreciating a spectrum of ophidian skull morphology (Gans 1974). The principle is becoming well appreciated in ""molecular morphology"" as well; the spectrum of variation in the structure of the antifreeze glycoproteins in fish, when combined with genomic information in a phylogenetic context, reveals an astounding story of convergence and idiosyncrasy in adaptation (Fletcher et al. 2001).New discoveries can change tentative generalities. Although the scientific process stimulates a continuous refinement of our epistemic basis, from time to time new discoveries overturn a paradigm completely. Not all cases are historical; a recent example is the change in our view of life‐history evolution in the desmognathine salamanders. The traditional view was that direct development, the loss of the aquatic larval stage, was a recently derived life history, a sensible view in light of how few directly developing desmognathines were known and how extremely limited were their geographic and habitat distributions. However, the discovery in the 1960s of the directly developing species Phaeognathus hubrichti, a more complete understanding of species' distributions and ecology, and the employment of sophisticated molecular methods for testing phylogenetic hypotheses have combined to indicate that direct development is the ancestral condition (Chippindale et al. 2004; Mueller et al. 2004).We can identify other recent examples in which new discoveries, empirical or theoretical, called existing paradigms into question. Polis's (1991) detailed description of omnivory in a desert food web, following Paine's (1988) critique of food web theory, helped redirect that theory. Reznick et al.'s (1997) documentation of rapid evolution of guppy life histories helped usher in a new perspective on the likelihood of very rapid evolution (Kinnison and Hendry 2001; Reznick and Ghalambor 2001; Frankham and Kingsolver 2004). Spichtig and Kawecki's (2004) examination of multilocus soft selection in a subdivided population revealed that, in general, such soft selection does not protect extensive genetic variation; the impression to the contrary has been cultivated by generalization from the earliest single‐locus models of the process, and the generalization appears to have been misleading.Robust inference requires horizontal comparisons and vertical integration. Our modern emphasis on process biology puts high value on horizontal comparisons, the examination of the same question at the same level in a variety of systems. Horizontal comparisons have revealed general processes, such as the reciprocal‐yield and 3/2 thinning laws in plants (Harper 1977), trophic cascades (Carpenter and Kitchell 1993), and the preference of females for male signals associated with size or vigor (MacLaren et al. 2004). When horizontal comparisons are synthesized quantitatively, larger generalities often emerge; the patterns of biogeography are an excellent example (Brown 1984; Harte et al. 1999; Hubbell 2001).A truly robust epistemic basis for ecology and evolutionary biology also requires vertical integration, the study of many ecological and evolutionary processes as they unfold in a single species or system. Indeed, one might argue that the great challenge of biology in this century will be to connect our understanding across different levels of organization. Many of us are devoting more effort toward such integration; indeed, a number of species and systems have emerged as ""natural models"" for the study of an integrated ecology and evolutionary biology, including animals such as Poecilia reticulata and Gasterosteus aculeatus and plants such as Silene latifolia and Trifolium repens. A sampling of recent literature devoted to S. latifolia includes studies of genetic population structure (Giraud 2004; Ingvarsson 2004; Tellier et al. 2005), molecular evolution (Sugiyama et al. 2003; Ingvarsson 2004; Lengerova et al. 2004; Filatov 2005), floral genetics (Delph et al. 2004a; Meagher et al. 2005) and development (Ageez et al. 2003; Delph et al. 2004b; Matsunaga et al. 2004), nectar production and composition (Gehring et al. 2004; Dotterl et al. 2005), and invasion biology (Wolfe et al. 2004). The value of integrated knowledge is aptly illustrated in the studies by Brakefield and his colleagues on the evolution and ecology of the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana (Fischer et al. 2003, 2004; Molleman et al. 2004; Zijlstra et al. 2004; Frankino et al. 2005; Saccheri et al. 2005; Steigenga et al. 2005; van't Hof et al. 2005).Does Our Self‐Organizing System Enforce Suitability and Encourage a Comparative Epistemology?Without doubt, our system encourages one aspect of suitability, that the organism be tractable for the question. Proposals to funding agencies rarely trumpet that the proposed study organism is sparsely distributed, occurs in low numbers, is difficult to find and impossible to maintain, has critical features that cannot be measured, or is otherwise intractable for careful observation or deployment in powerful experiments. One cannot imagine a phylogenetics proposal that points out that the group to be studied has no informative characters or that the only genes that can be sequenced evolve at rates that cannot resolve the relationships among the member taxa.Whether we give sufficient encouragement to considering whether the question applies to the organism is another issue. If the literature includes declarations of prey unpalatability diagnosed from predators that do not encounter the prey (Gunzburger and Travis 2005), then it probably holds many examples of inappropriately directed questions that are less easily recognized by readers without extensive familiarity with the organism. In these cases, the organisms are being used, in effect, as analog simulations of an interesting ecological or evolutionary process. If this is the real idea behind such work, genuine digital simulations would seem a much wiser choice (see, e.g., Yedid and Bell 2001; Chow et al. 2004).Our best‐known systems, both model systems and ""natural models,"" are not random samples of their larger groups. Our model systems are, by and large, human commensals that have probably experienced rapid population growth in the last several thousand years. Although we can argue over which genetic or genomic properties might be biased by this history, expecting no bias would be naive. For example, the chiasma frequencies of domesticated mammals are not representative of those in mammals as a whole (Burt and Bell 1987). Many of our emerging ""natural models"" are cosmopolitan taxa usually found at high densities (Poecilia reticulata is an obvious exception to the cosmopolitan attribute). This is not to claim that these systems offer idiosyncratic results but to argue that we will not recognize which results are idiosyncratic without a wider foundation of comparative investigation.Whether the conclusions we draw from our horizontal comparisons are sufficiently robust depends on whether we have sampled taxonomic and character diversity properly. Although practitioners of meta‐analyses or comparative studies worry explicitly about their sampling of taxa or characters, we may not worry enough about the sampling of our examples when we attempt a synthesis or seek generalizations. We sometimes make premature generalizations or fail to appreciate fully that a particular generalization might not be robust because it emerges from a circumscribed sample of systems, a limited range of diversity, or a peculiar set of experiments. For example, the earliest studies of biochemical variation were motivated in part by the possibility that generalizations about the ubiquity of adaptive genetic variation might be overly influenced by their emergence from studies of visible polymorphisms (Lewontin 1974). In another arena, ecologists argue whether trophic cascades are a general or a circumscribed phenomenon, and one part of this argument seems, at least to me, to maintain that their apparent prominence was a premature generalization from marine and aquatic systems (Polis and Strong 1996; Oksanen and Oksanen 2000).Even less clear is that we wrestle with the sampling of taxonomic, character, and system diversity when we conceive and design our original empirical work. We often let the organism lead to the question or find the most tractable organism for a question rather than seeking an organism or system whose attributes place it in an especially critical position for understanding the broad issue at hand. Reznick's study of the life‐history diversity in female poeciliid fishes illustrates how, ideally, we would approach these problems (Reznick and Miles 1989; Reznick et al. 1992, 2002; Arias and Reznick 2000); his initial survey isolated critical questions and critical taxa, and his subsequent efforts have been focused accordingly. Of course, ""ideal"" is not always possible or practical, and most of the time the best we can do may be to build our generalities and principles gradually from the organisms and systems that are available and suitable.An emerging issue is whether we apply the criteria of suitability when we embark on meta‐analyses or other exploitations of preexisting data. Obviously, we employ the first criterion of suitability, which is tractability; the data are available, so we use them. Whether those data are faithful, in relevant ways, to the question for which they will be exploited, even though they were collected for another purpose, is the critical issue.This issue is central to an already large and still‐burgeoning literature in ecology and evolutionary biology that exploits preexisting data of one sort or another. For example, the ecomorphological community studies of Ricklefs and Travis (Ricklefs and Travis 1980; Travis and Ricklefs 1983) are based on measurements of museum specimens—one type of preexisting data—and their validity relies on the assumption that those specimens are representative samples of the morphological variation in those species in those areas. Museum or herbarium specimens have been used to approach a wide variety of topics in ecology and evolutionary biology (see recent articles by McGlynn [1999], Simberloff et al. [2000], and Knouft [2003]); some conclusions are more likely than others to be robust to collection biases.The use of tabulated and archived data in meta‐analyses and synthetic analyses carries its own risks of inadvertent bias. In some cases, such as studies of numerical dynamics, the data are being used for the same purpose for which they were collected (e.g., Kendall et al. 1998), but in others, data collected for one purpose are exploited for a different one, and in these cases the potential for bias is an important issue. For example, many early quantitative analyses of food webs exploited data that were collected as by‐products of other work (Cohen et al. 1993), and substantial biases were present (Paine 1988).The biases can arise in many ways. For example, Jeff Leips and I published a study of numerical dynamics in Heterandria formosa that included density estimates of many other species (Leips and Travis 1999).

https://doi.org/10.1093/evolut/qpaf070,Evolution of plasticity and character displacement in a fluctuating environment,"Species that compete for the same resource may undergo ecological character displacement (CD), where the phenotype of each species evolves to deviate from its optimum in the absence of competition. As natural habitats are rarely static, interspecific competition is likely to occur in environments that fluctuate over time. Such environmental fluctuations can in turn cause the evolution of phenotypic plasticity for traits mediating the competition. However, the interplay of environmental fluctuations, evolution of plasticity, and character displacement, has been little investigated. We use a quantitative genetic model to study theoretically how a randomly fluctuating environment and evolution of plasticity influence the outcome of ecological CD between two competing species. We show that environmental fluctuations make the conditions for CD more stringent, requiring stronger competitive selection relative to stabilizing selection. This occurs because environmental fluctuations reduce the average population size, and thereby competition intensity. Evolving plasticity can restore CD by buffering the impact of environmental fluctuations through phenotypic tracking, to a degree that depends on environmental predictability. Somewhat paradoxically, competition that favors phenotypic divergence among species can cause convergence in plasticity, when this reduces the load caused by fluctuations in phenotypic divergence. Our results shed light on how competition and plasticity influences evolution of the fundamental niche in a fluctuating environment.",W4409347057,True,0.9962685704231262
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065x.2010.01001.x,Intracellular pathogens: living in an extreme environment,"The phylogenetic tree segregates into three major groups, which probably descended from a common ancestor: the bacteria, the archaea, and the eucarya (1–3). While bacteria and archaea lack a true nucleus and intracellular organelles, eucarya possess these. The origin of the ancestor remains elusive, but it emerged about 4 billion years ago. The bacteria probably started life 3.5 billion years ago and eukaryotes emerged 1.75 billion years thereafter. Sometime in between archaea appeared. Eukaryotes began as unicellular organisms but soon also developed multicellular forms. Bacteria and archaea had sufficient time to exploit all niches of the abiotic environment, ranging from ice cold glacial lakes to fiery geysers – from the highest mountain peaks to the deepest sea beds. They also quickly developed forms of mutualism by forming colonies composed of mixed populations. With the evolution of eucarya, new environments could be exploited. Today prokaryotes are the most prevalent form of life on earth, making up the majority of our biomass. It has been estimated that more than 1030 prokaryotic organisms live on our globe. Thus, archaea and bacteria are far more prevalent than eucarya. Even human beings comprise more prokaryotic cells than mammalian cells, which range on the order of 1012 human cells and 1014 prokaryotes mostly concentrated in our intestinal system (4–7). It is surprising how well archaea have adapted to extreme environments, yet remained focused on abiotic habitats. They survive in highly salty environments as the halobacteria do, or at extremely high temperatures as the thermophils do. One of the few biotic environments populated by archaea is the gut of mammalians (6, 8). Methanobacteria intriguingly have chosen the digestive tract of ruminants, such as cattle and are responsible for the enormous amount of methane released into the atmosphere due to excessive beef consumption by the human population (9). Archaea are also a common component of the normal human microbiota (6). Notably, Methanobrevibacter spp. produce methane by biodegradation of complex polysaccharides and remain a major population of our normal intestinal flora. Intriguingly, however, archaea never became a threat to humankind, they never developed a parasitic lifestyle, and never exploited the intracellular compartment of cells. Hence, archaea remained mutualistic and are friends that do not cause infectious diseases. In contrast, bacteria heavily capitalized on biotic environments and have become foes of humankind as major causes of infectious diseases (10). Exploitation of other living organisms as habitat is not restricted to bacteria; they have also been heavily exploited by eucarya. Notably, the unicellular apicomplexa (malaria plasmodia and Toxoplasma spp.) and the kinetoplastida (Trypanosoma spp. and Leishmania spp.) followed convergent evolutionary traits toward living within eukaryotic host cells. They even went one step further and learned to exploit other species, notably insects as vectors, for the purpose of dissemination. When human beings evolved some million years ago, microbes were well equipped for conquering this new habitat. Even more so, human beings created novel opportunities for microbes by their rapidly changing cultural behavior (10). Thus, ca. 20 000 years ago, people started to live in more settled patterns. During nomadic times, humans were already inhabited by microbes, some of them harmful to the individual and their family companions. Yet, they often failed to spread to larger populations. Bacteria living on carrion found entry into humans, who consumed raw meat. They quickly adapted to their new host as did numerous helminths, viruses, and protozoa. When humans changed to settlements over nomadic lifestyles, they came together closer, first in small hamlets and later in towns; they domesticated animals and crops in their vicinity. This provided attractive new opportunities for microbes, which had colonized cattle, dogs, or cats earlier and now had ample opportunity to exploit humans as a novel host. Opportunities also arose for fecal microbes, which were transmitted from human-to-human directly or through contaminated food or water. Protozoan parasites learned to capitalize on insects as vectors for efficacious human-to-human transmission and helminths benefited from close contact between humans and domesticated animals by transmission from their definitive host to an intermediate host and back again. The first towns arising 1 or 2 millennia before Christ facilitated further spreading and global migrations – such as the Crusades in the first millennium after Christ – favoring microbial exchange between populations living in different regions of the earth. Importantly, spreading of pathogens to larger populations had become possible, and plagues became commonplace. In the case of synergistic coexistence to the benefit of both host and intruder, defense mechanisms do not make sense. In the case of peaceful coexistence, defense strategies were not really needed since no harm was encountered. A different picture arises when microbial colonization results in stable infection followed by disease as a frequent, albeit not essential, consequence. Defense strategies are needed to protect the host from damage or even death. Innate defense mechanisms are common among multicellular eurcarya. Even unicellular eucarya know how to engulf and kill microbes, probably mostly for the purposes of food consumption. Based on particulate nutrient uptake, defense strategies evolved and it was Elie Metchnikoff (1845–1916), the discoverer of innate immunity, who described the existence of phagocytosis in various eucarya for the first time (11). Similarities of numerous innate immune mechanisms in invertebrates and vertebrates offer testimony to the fact that multicellular organisms were consistently attacked by microbial intruders and urgently needed appropriate defense stratagems to survive. In contrast, the specific adaptive immune system is a privilege of vertebrates. Vertebrates emerged on our globe 525 million years ago and 300 million years later, true mammals emerged. Only 5 million years ago, apes appeared on earth from which human beings are descended. Vertebrates must have been highly vulnerable to microbial intruders, which caused marked evolutionary pressure toward development of an adaptive immune system with unique specificity to avoid excessive collateral damage. As a consequence, they all developed such an immune system, albeit through two distinct modes of evolution. Both systems are characterized by enormous specificity due to highly variable receptors expressed by specialized cells, the lymphocytes. Antibodies are secreted into the surrounding milieu, whereas the T-cell receptors remain cell-bound. A quantum leap occurred 450 million years ago in jawed vertebrates, which was made possible by the appearance of recombination activation genes as central directors of gene rearrangement and recombination (12). Jawless vertebrates did not acquire this capacity. Yet, they have at hand an alternative immune system that provides variability and thus unique specificity for antigens, as well. This system is based on usage of variable lymphocyte receptors comprised of leucine-rich repeat segments. Hence, adaptive immunity was so essential for survival it was twice independently discovered by vertebrates (13, 14). Since the 19th century, a series of profound changes in human lifestyle occurred. Cities became less muddy, stones and later concrete became dominant building materials – unfavorable habitats for microbes. Clean water was provided, sanitary and sewage equipment installed, and hygienic measures became more efficacious. De-worming methods, insecticides to kill vectors, vaccines to prevent infectious disease, and finally, antibiotics to treat and cure infectious disease were developed as countermeasures against microbial pathogens – at least in industrialized countries. In developing countries, overcrowding and poor hygiene in slums and townships fostered diseases of poverty, such as acquired immuno deficiency syndrome (AIDS), tuberculosis (TB), and malaria. On top of this, increasing migratory behavior, uncontrolled exploitation of our last natural reservoirs bringing wild animals into close contact with humans, as well as large-scale industrialized animal farming to satisfy enormous meat consumption demands have caused novel challenges to humans and novel opportunities for newly emerging and re-emerging pathogens (9). Microbes needed to develop not only invasion strategies to enter the host but also strategies to evade host immunity. Based on this knowledge, it may come as a surprise that numerous microbes – bacteria, fungi, and parasites – chose one of the most efficacious effector cells of antimicrobial defense as habitat: the mononuclear phagocyte. Beyond doubt, this cell type provides an extreme environment raising the question as to the advantages of this habitat for the predator (15). It has often been stated that the inside of a cell is a rich source of nutrients. This may be questioned. First, most intracellular pathogens reside in the phagosome, which they have to manipulate to reduce the aggressive environment that is formed after fusion with lysosomes. Few pathogens have designed egression strategies from the phagosome into the cytosol, with Listeria monocytogenes being the best-studied example. Probably one major advantage of the intracellular lifestyle is the low risk of mixed intracellular infection by different pathogens on a single-cell level. (One rare occasion may be macrophage coinfection by human immunodeficiency virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.) Hence, in the intracellular milieu, competition between microbes, viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa seems to be rare: a clear advantage for the intruder managing to live there. Probably the capacity of mononuclear phagocytes to actively engulf microbes was a critical step to pave the way for acquisition of an intracellular lifestyle, and this may be the reason for the predilection of numerous pathogens for these cells programmed for host defense. Moreover, macrophages are long-lived, and this distinguishes them from the neutrophils, which are also professional phagocytes but with a much shorter lifespan. Many mononuclear phagocytes live for weeks, whereas neutrophils die within less than a day and hence cannot provide a stable niche for intracellular predators. Once entry into the host cell has been accomplished, host cell function and integrity had to be maintained to allow for prolonged persistence within the host cell. As a final step, microbes need to be released from their cellular habitat so that they can transit to other cells and accomplish the ultimate goal – transmission to the next host. L. monocytogenes, malaria plasmodia, and Toxoplasma gondii are well-studied examples of how pathogens pass from cell to cell without entering the extracellular milieu. Indeed, malaria plasmodia and T. gondii are obligate intracellular pathogens, which strictly depend on host cells in the human host. In contrast, L. monocytogenes as well as M. tuberculosis, Brucella spp., and Salmonella enterica have retained their capacity to live in the extracellular milieu prior to entering new host cells. These pathogens can even live in the abiotic environment for quite some time. Even though M. tuberculosis is often seen as the ultimate intracellular bacterium, it flourishes in the extracellular detritus of caseous granulomas where it reaches numbers of up to 1013 organisms. Transmission to the next host can be a major obstacle. T. gondii and L. monocytogenes are transmitted both vertically and horizontally. Hence, they are major causes of miscarriage and abortion. Leishmania spp. and malaria plasmodia use insects as vectors for spreading – sand flies and mosquitoes, respectively. M. tuberculosis is typically transmitted through aerosols, and Brucella spp., T. gondii, and S. enterica through smear infections or uptake of contaminated food and water. In consideration of host defense, the intracellular habitat offers another advantage: it shields the microbial invader from attack by antibodies. T lymphocytes, therefore, are critical mediators of protection. They monitor host cells for infection and mobilize appropriate effector functions. On the molecular level, T cells produce and induce cytokines and effector molecules. On the cellular level, they attract professional phagocytes to the site of microbial deposition and activate their antimicrobial capacities. On the organ level, granulomatous lesions frequently develop which help to contain the pathogen and in some instances even achieve their eradication. Intracellular infection ranges from short to long term. Listeriosis is the paragon example for a short-lived bacterial infection since the pathogen is eradicated once T lymphocytes have reached full power. In contrast, M. tuberculosis, the paragon of a long-lived bacterial infection, can persist within macrophages over the lifespan of the human host, often in a stage of dormancy. Frequently this pathogen is contained at such a low level that clinical disease does not develop, and asymptomatic latent infection continues. In contrast to intuition, intracellular life in mononuclear phagocytes must have an evolutionary attractiveness, since microbes of distant relationship have chosen processes of convergent evolution toward this goal. Thus, Brucella spp., M. tuberculosis, and Leishmania spp. have selected this cell type as habitat and established measures to avoid attack by aggressive effector molecules. This volume of Immunological Reviews comprises 19 excellent reviews, which give an exciting though necessarily selective overview of the crosstalk between intracellular pathogens and the host immune response. The field is too diverse to cover all aspects and selection was needed. Importantly, the volume attempts to be bilingual. Several chapters emphasize the language of the host, analyzing the immune response from different angles. Others use the language of microbial pathogens, analyzing their invasion and evasion strategies in the face of an active immune response. Views of immunology focus on pathogen sensing and activation of cellular and humoral host factors. These determine the outcome of infection with an emphasis on the central host cell, the mononuclear phagocyte, which frequently serves as habitat and effector cell, depending on its activation status (16). The mononuclear phagocyte is not only an effector cell but also has the capacity of monitoring invasion by microbial intruders. By means of pattern recognition receptors, deviations from homeostasis are recognized and signals transmitted to other members of the host defense armamentarium, notably, the T lymphocytes (17). The T cells as central mediators of acquired protection receive attention in two articles: effector T cells, the first line in the acquired defense (18); memory T cells, the long-lived cells that guarantee a better control of repeated infection (19). Despite the original conception that CD4+ T cells expressing T-helper 1 (Th1) functions are responsible for defense against intracellular microbial pathogens, we now know that in addition, CD8+ T cells perform effector functions against many intracellular pathogens (20). In addition to major histocompatibility complex molecules, which serve as reference structures for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD1-restricted T cells have received increasing interest in infections with intracellular bacteria (21). Memory is generally defined as a persisting adaptive immune response in the absence of nominal antigen (22). Thus, by definition, during chronic infection true memory should not develop. Yet, the value of immune memory for host defense is beyond any doubt and amply illustrated by the success of vaccination against numerous infectious diseases – albeit against diseases conquered by antibodies rather than T cells. Even though B cells are considered to make a more peripheral contribution to adaptive protection against intracellular microbes, recent findings have revised our thinking. B lymphocytes play a role in intracellular infections (23), not only as antibody producers but also as regulators of immunity independent from antibodies. A significant number of reviews focus on the intimate crosstalk between host and pathogen. Invasion strategies are being elucidated on the molecular level to identify the key bottlenecks of entry into and exit from host cells (24). Although it was originally thought that microbes, once they have entered their host cells, would leave their habitat biologically intact, more recent findings have revealed that autophagy is a frequent consequence of the interplay between intracellular pathogens and their host cells, highlighting that this crosstalk is much more dynamic and complex (25). Autophagy may be viewed as a defense mechanism that allows microbial clearance. Yet, it is also part of the survival strategies of pathogens. The complexity of intracellular microbial infections is well reflected by the multigenicity underlying susceptibility to respective diseases. Without doubt, certain monogenic disorders predispose to intracellular infectious diseases such as mutations or deletions of cytokine genes critical for Th1 cell function and development. Beyond this, however, recent findings have begun to reveal the more complex interplay of multiple genes that modulate human susceptibility to infection and disease progression (26). The high complexity of intercommunication between pathogen and multicellular host in a matrix-like arrangement demands a systems biology approach, which is just starting to be explored (27). Additional layers of complexity are added by the inclusion of insect vectors as third partner. Insects do not serve as passive transport vehicles. Rather they actively interact with pathogens of human hosts. The review by Steinert and Levashina (28) deals with host defense mechanisms of insects. Even so, this is not the end of the story. Increasing evidence suggests that intracellular pathogens can serve as cofactors for chronic inflammation and autoimmune disease and may also participate in malignant processes. Reciprocally, declining incidences of infectious diseases in industrialized countries are paralleled by increasing incidences of allergic and chronic inflammatory diseases as well as autoimmune diseases, suggesting negative feedback between these two categories (29). The hygiene hypothesis was a first attempt to provide an explanation for these findings. Obviously this field is far more complex and has to extend to different types of lifestyle as driving forces (30). No doubt, we can expect exciting news as this area unfolds. The second part of this volume is purposefully highly restrictive and covers four bacterial and three protozoan pathogens. This selection focuses first on studies of pathogens, which provide insights of general relevance into mechanisms underlying the host–pathogen relationship. Second, selection is based on importance of pathogens as health threats, such as TB and malaria, which together with AIDS rank highest on the infamous mortality list of infectious diseases (31). L. monocytogenes is a pathogen of minor threat to humans, although it can endanger the fetus and cause abortion. L. monocytogenes, however, has provided the most powerful model to study the molecular biology of bacterial virulence factors and host immune responses (32, 33). S. enterica comprises numerous serotypes, which can cause acute or chronic infections, either locally (e.g. gastroenteritis) or systemically (e.g. typhoid) (34). This pathogen is highly versatile living within and outside of host cells and hence defense requires both humoral and cellular immunity (35). TB is a paragon among the causative agents of chronic infections. This pathogen resists immune attack, either in a dormant stage without causing clinical disease or in a metabolically active stage, causing highly lethal disease (36). The chronicity of latent infection is highly demanding for the immune system and requires continuous fine-tuning in response to coinfections, which can impair protective immunity (37, 38). Even though Brucella spp. has some similarity to M. tuberculosis, it has developed specific strategies to escape immune attack and survive in the host, ultimately leading to chronic infection sometimes with relapsing disease (39). The protozoan agents of malaria (40), toxoplasmosis (41), and leishmaniasis (42) all undergo complex life cycles in different hosts. Malaria plasmodia and T. gondii can infect a variety of host cells, which they enter and exit by gliding motility. T. gondii infects muscle cells and cells of the central nervous system, while malaria plasmodia prefer erythrocytes and hepatocytes. Hence, both pathogens favor non-professional phagocytes as habitat with the extreme example of erythrocytes lacking the antigen-presentation machinery which are misused by malaria plasmodia. In contrast, the intracellular lifestyle of Leishmania spp. bears significant similarities to that of M. tuberculosis and Brucella spp., in that they prefer to reside in mononuclear phagocytes. Although the chapters compiled in this volume of Immunological Reviews intentionally focus on basic mechanisms underlying infections with intracellular pathogens, it is obvious that they can provide guidelines for novel intervention measures, notably, rational vaccination strategies. Vaccine candidates are currently undergoing different stages of clinical trials for malaria and TB, and the next decade will reveal whether we are successful in tipping the balance of this long-standing combat in our favor (43, 44). Microbial pathogens have exploited the human species from its beginning. Neither have microbes succeeded in eliminating humans, nor have humans succeeded in eradicating pathogens, with the one example of smallpox (9). Apparently they are equally strong opponents with very different survival strategies. On the one hand, microbial pathogens place their trust solely in the Darwinian principle of random mutation followed by selection of the fittest (45). Although humans have to obey these rules as well, they are significantly hampered by slow replication time. Higher organisms have therefore added specialization as a complementary strategy. To defend us from microbial intruders, a highly efficacious immune system has evolved which rapidly senses the invaders and mobilizes the most appropriate defense mechanisms specifically targeting the culprit. It is this specialized system rather than mutation and selection that has allowed us to withstand constant invasion by microbes. Humans have the opportunity to add one more layer to this repertoire of defense, that is, the use of another specialized organ to create novel defense strategies – the brain. With our ingenuity, we can devise novel tactics, notably vaccines and antibiotics. Using our intelligence, we have already developed numerous vaccines against pathogens. Yet, vaccines against intracellular microbial pathogens have thus far evaded successful implementation. Better understanding of the host–pathogen relationship can provide the blueprint for rational vaccine design against these major threats. The author thanks M. L. Grossman for help in preparing the manuscript and Stephen T. Reece for critical reading of the manuscript. The author declares no conflict of interest.",W1489371795,True,0.93276047706604
https://doi.org/10.1111/eff.12818,Patterns of Ecological Specialisation Among Multiple Piscivorous Morphs of a Diverse Assemblage of <i>Salvelinus</i> Fishes,"ABSTRACT Adaptive radiation is considered to be a major source of biodiversity in charrs of the genus Salvelinus. These fishes demonstrate numerous examples of diversification in postglacial lakes and rivers resulting in the emergence of different ecomorphs, including piscivorous. Usually, the number of fish feeders does not exceed two, suggesting the existence of ecological and/or internal factors that prevent further diversification. Under these circumstances, rare instances of increases in the number of piscivorous morphs are of particular interest. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the piscivorous charr assemblage in Lake Kronotskoe, residence of the most diverse species flock of Salvelinus fishes. To unravel the diversity and ecological relationships of piscivorous charrs, we analysed their morphology and microsatellite DNA polymorphism, distribution within the lake, trophic preferences and parasite load, as well as trace element accumulation, stable isotope and free fatty acid ratios. We revealed that, apart from a few strictly benthivorous morphs, the lake is inhabited by four closely related but morphologically and genetically distinct morphs that exhibit a range of piscivorous specialisation: from opportunistic secondary predation to ultra‐specialised primary piscivory. They effectively exploit the spatiotemporal structure of the ecosystem and experience diversifying selection due to niche discordance. Each piscivorous morph develops specific phenotypic, ecological and life history traits that allow it to terminate weakly overlapping branches of the trophic chain and share the energy flows of the lake ecosystem. Our data suggest that Lake Kronotskoe facilitates high level of ecological opportunity that favours niche expansion and allows the piscivorous lineage to simultaneously realise the archetypical modes of ecological diversification available to fishes in cold‐water freshwaters.",W4403000884,True,0.9844882488250732
https://doi.org/10.33730/2310-4678.4.2023.292721,THE ROLE OF SNAKE VENOM IN THE BIOTIC INTERACTION,"It is highlighted the ecological significance of biotic interactions. Biotic relationships can be intra- or interspecific, positive or negative and cover a wide range of interactions, including predation, commensalism, mutualism, competition and parasitism. It is indicated that snake venoms, which are the best studied, attract the greatest attention of researchers. The role of predators in the formation of the structure and functioning of ecosystems is analyzed. It has been established that the predator–prey ecological interaction causes mutual physiological, morphological and behavioral adaptations at the individual, intra- and inter-species levels. It is noted that toxins are important adaptation that arose due to evolution. Representatives of venomous animals are present in every ecosystem, more than 250,000 species of animals use their venom for predation, as well as for defense and survival. Іnformation about the types of poisonous and venomous animals is summarized in the article. The composition of animal venoms and the pathological consequences of their influence are presented. It is noted that the lost of habitats, climate change and biological invasions pose a threat to ecological processes that are associated with the interaction between species. The importance of snakes for ecosystems, their significance for trophic network and regulating pests is highlighted. It was found that from an ecological point of view, snake venom is an important functional trait that mediates biotic interaction between several organisms. Аt the same time it is a stressful biotic factor for other living beings",W4392609079,True,0.9886789917945862
https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.13746,Competitive interactions affect introgression and population viability amidst maladaptive hybridization,"The deliberate release of captive-bred individuals, the accidental escape of domesticated strains, or the invasion of closely related conspecifics into wild populations can all lead to introgressive hybridization, which poses a challenge for conservation and wildlife management. Rates of introgression and the magnitude of associated demographic impacts vary widely across ecological contexts. However, the reasons for this variation remain poorly understood. One rarely considered phenomenon in this context is soft selection, wherein relative trait values determine success in intraspecific competition for a limiting resource. Here we develop an eco-genetic model explicitly focussed on understanding the influence of such competitive interactions on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of wild populations experiencing an influx of foreign/domesticated individuals. The model is applicable to any taxon that experiences natural or human-mediated inputs of locally maladapted genotypes ('intrusion'), in addition to phenotype-dependent competition for a limiting resource (e.g. breeding sites, feeding territories). The effects of both acute and chronic intrusion depended strongly on the relative competitiveness of intruders versus locals. When intruders were competitively inferior, density-dependent regulation limited their reproductive success (ability to compete for limited spawning sites), which prevented strong introgression or population declines from occurring. In contrast, when intruders were competitively superior, this amplified introgression and led to increased maladaptation of the admixed population. This had negative consequences for population size and population viability. The results were sensitive to the intrusion level, the magnitude of reproductive excess, trait heritability and the extent to which intruders were maladapted relative to locals. Our findings draw attention to under-appreciated interactions between phenotype-dependent competitive interactions and maladaptive hybridization, which may be critical to determining the impact captive breeding programmes and domesticated escapees can have on otherwise self-sustaining wild populations.",W4400258445,True,0.9954006671905518
https://doi.org/10.1111/rec.14354,The role of habitat in predator–prey dynamics with applications to restoration,"Habitat is a powerful force in ecosystems, and the quantity and quality of habitat can shape ecosystem structure and function. Among the many important roles that habitat plays is as a mediator of ecological interactions, including predator–prey dynamics. In the context of ecosystem restoration, there is great potential to better understand how predator–prey dynamics are influenced by habitat and whether this has implications for how ecosystems are managed. We consider the ways in which habitat serves as an important mediator of interactions between predators and their prey and present four ways in which habitat acts as an intermediary that enhances or diminishes this relationship. We found that habitat provides refuge from predators and shapes the physical traits of prey as they use their surroundings to protect themselves. We also discuss how habitat creates physical resistance and sets the cost of predation for predators and how habitat facilitates apparent competition within a community context. These roles of habitat are well established in ecology, but we believe they are underdeveloped from an applied perspective. We conclude that habitat must be appropriately considered in the context of how it mediates predation. Given the ways that habitat influences predation, restoration efforts should consider if and how physical measures may positively or negatively affect species interactions and whether this could lead to success or failure of overall programs.",W4406755848,True,0.989788293838501
https://doi.org/10.18442/014,Microclimatic effects on Central European deciduous tree species and their interactions with arthropod herbivory,"Arthropod herbivores act as mediators for effects that cascade up and down the trophic chain. Therefore, herbivory plays an important role for driving ecosystem processes and influencing ecosystem structures and functions. Generally, ecosystem processes are mediated by interactions between organisms. The plant community composition is influenced by competitive interactions among plants, which is affected by herbivore species. Leaf area loss to insects can reduce tree growth, but alters material flows from canopies to forest soils. Therefore, the chemical quality of litter is changed (increases in nitrogen content) through enhanced nutrient cycling rates caused by herbivory. Climate and microclimate can affect insect physiology and behaviour directly or indirectly through climate-induced changes of host plants. Temperature determines the geographical range, site and timing of activities, success of oviposition and hatching, and the duration of developmental stages of arthropod herbivores. The activity of poikilothermic insects increases with temperature, and therefore growth and consumption rates are enhanced. However, morphological and functional leaf traits that determine host plant palatability often mediate indirect environmental effects on herbivory. Leaf palatability is determined by leaf toughness, nutrients, and defence compounds. In warm environments, expected high rates of arthropod herbivory can then be suppressed by negative changes of leaf traits. Microclimate gradients are found across the different strata of forest ecosystems. Abiotic factors change vertically between forest layers due to a micro-environmental gradient. Along the vertical gradient, microclimate is affected by the light regime, with increasing temperatures and decreasing humidity from understorey to upper canopies. Various organisms are distributed along the vertical forest gradient based on changes in environmental conditions and in the quality and quantity of available resources. Temperate deciduous forests reveal highly stratified arthropod communities with vertical and horizontal distribution patterns. Microclimatic requirements and the availability of food resources along the vertical forest gradient can reflect spatial distributions and preferences of arthropods. This research study investigated arthropod herbivory on leaves of deciduous tree species along the vertical gradient of temperate forests. A field study with ten forests sites in Central Germany and an experimental study in greenhouses were conducted, addressing effects of microclimate and leaf traits on arthropod herbivory. Juvenile and adult individuals of Fagus sylvatica L. (European beech), the dominant deciduous tree species in Central Europe, were chosen as main research subjects. Furthermore, Acer pseudoplatanus L. (Sycamore maple) and Carpinus betulus L. (hornbeam), two frequent tree species in the forest understorey, were also surveyed.",W3202706325,True,0.9962062835693359
https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4044741,Mentoring and Education: A Lifetime of Experience and Learning,"As recipient of the 2018 Robert M. Nerem Education and Mentorship Medal from the ASME, I was asked to prepare an article to contribute my reflections on these topics that arise whenever we offer advice and guidance to our younger colleagues. This represents my personal views on Bob Nerem, after whom the award is named, my experiences that have impacted me as a mentor, and some words of advice, offered cautiously and with qualifications, with regard to best practices in mentoring.This is a paper of a different sort than normally appears in the Journal of Biomechanical Engineering. It initiates what the Editors and I hope will be a tradition of articles written by recipients of the Robert M. Nerem Education and Mentorship Medal. I was pleased, if a bit intimidated, by being the inaugural contributor, but in the end, found it to be a rewarding and satisfying experience. While each subsequent recipient will no doubt have their own interpretation of what is appropriate, I chose to follow a path that parallels my presentation at the 2018 World Congress of Biomechanics. I start with a section that describes what Bob has meant to me, including the traits of his that I so value and try to emulate. Next, a section describes some of my own personal experiences that helped to shape my thinking about the role of a mentor, as well as best practices. In the final sections, I discuss some of what I consider to be the most important responsibilities of a mentor, and what we need to consider as we attempt to set an example for our mentees and guide them down a path of success.It seems appropriate, as the first recipient of the Nerem Medal, to begin this paper by recognizing the individual after whom the award is named, and to write briefly about his characteristics as a mentor, an educator, and a friend, and how he has influenced so many throughout their careers. There is no award or recognition that could mean more to me than being the inaugural recipient of the Nerem Medal. After all, education and mentoring are two of the most important roles for those of us working in academia. In many respects, our success or failure as researchers and educators hinges on our ability to train our research students in how to progress through a successful project. The success of our academic “offspring” reflects back on ourselves and our lab environment. Bob Nerem epitomizes traits to strive for as educators and mentors.Bob Nerem has long been my role model and sage advisor. I first met Bob shortly after he had joined the University of Houston as Department Chair, long before he wound up at Georgia Tech. He had invited me there to give a seminar during my early days on the MIT faculty and to explore the possibility of my joining him in Houston. By that time, Bob was already widely recognized for the key role he played in unraveling the interactions between vascular biology and cardiovascular fluid mechanics. These were the days when mechanobiology (though it was not called that at the time) came into existence, and the basic tools needed to study how cell biology could be regulated by fluid shear forces were just being developed. Bob was instrumental in this process. The uniquely high degree of collegiality found in this field owes much to Bob's efforts to foster it, as well as the example he set through all his personal and professional interactions.Even in those early days, Bob was recognized not only for his fundamental research contributions, but also as a master-builder of programs in bioengineering. He later moved to Georgia Tech in 1987 to shape the bioengineering program there, establishing the Parker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience. His vision, which soon after became a reality, was to build an institute which would bring the engineering and science communities together under the same roof as a means of removing barriers for collaboration—this was convergence in the truest sense, long before it became widely acknowledged. In building the program, Bob gave equal weight to research excellence, teaching abilities, and an open, collaborative attitude. The members he attracted to the Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience, and who eventually populated many of the life science departments at Georgia Tech, are ample evidence of his recruiting successes.As I reflect on what makes Bob so successful as a mentor, one attribute keeps coming to mind. Bob is more effective than anyone I know in connecting with another individual on a personal level and immediately establishing a rapport that facilitates an open, collegial relationship. On meeting someone new (even a waiter in a restaurant!), Bob will ask their name, and oftentimes, strike up a conversation. He does this in a way that demonstrates a genuine interest in this person as an individual, and not just another anonymous face. Without intruding on their “personal space,” he always elicits a smile. This is a trait that comes naturally to Bob, but I have yet to master it. This is, in my view, a truly unique and valuable talent for those who can achieve it.Bob has devoted much of his time and wisdom to mentoring others, providing an example to rising faculty on how best to succeed, not only in their careers, but in life in all its dimensions. Those who know Bob well have no doubt heard of his “Rules of Life.” But for many readers, this may be new. Bob generated this list over a period of many years. It gives some idea of how he has led his own life, and how he guides others toward success (see Box 1).During my career, I had the benefit to learn not only from Bob, but also from some of the other leading figures of our profession. At MIT, Forbes Dewey and Ascher Shapiro were my first mentors, Forbes for my Master's degree and Ascher for my Doctorate. Between the two of them, I learned the excitement of research and discovery, but perhaps more importantly, I came to recognize how a mentor can have lasting impact on one's career, long after the direct interaction ceases. I also had many memorable discussions with others who taught me important lessons: YC (Bert) Fung (the founder and elder statesman of biomechanics), Tim Pedley (a leading figure in cardiovascular fluid mechanics who had a tremendous influence on me during my early years on the MIT faculty), and Shelly Weinbaum (who taught me how a new perspective even on an old problem can lead to important new insights and discoveries). Every generation has its leaders, and it is important for young researchers to seek them out and benefit from their insights and advice.This article is a personal perspective, but it is my hope that you, as readers, will find certain parts that resonate with your own experience, or at least provide useful food for thought. By no means do I feel that I am any more qualified than the next person to mentor, but having received this award, it seems right that I should pass on some of my experiences, as well as some useful information that I have derived from the literature. While this paper is based primarily on personal experience, I also have also drawn upon several references, most importantly, from a publication from the National Academies Press: Adviser, Teacher, Role Model, Friend: On Being a Mentor to Students in Science and Engineering [2]. I found that this resonated with my own experience and consider it to be “required reading” for anyone starting an academic career. Another excellent source can be found at the NIH website on mentoring [3].Early in my career, I learned an important lesson when I came to realize the limitations of engineering (or any single discipline alone) in a field such as bioengineering, which draws so much from the neighboring disciplines of molecular and cell biology, physiology, and medicine. There had been a time when, as a fluid dynamicist, one could “pick the low hanging fruit” by identifying an important medical problem, extract the interesting fluid mechanics questions, and gain new insights into a fundamental problem of physiology or disease. Enormous and important contributions had been made to various medical fields, notably orthopedics and vascular physiology, simply by applying rigorous quantitative analysis to the human body. But the limitations of a purely engineering approach soon became obvious, as I embarked on one of my first forays into a medical problem, glaucoma appeared to have a clear cause related to fluid mechanics. Glaucoma results from increased intraocular pressure as a consequence of increased resistance to the outflow of aqueous humor in the anterior segment of the eye that leads to damage of the optic nerve and progressive blindness. The connection to fluid mechanics seemed natural. It was evident to a naïve engineer that glaucoma was simply a plumbing problem; a bit of analysis and experimental modeling would yield brilliant new insights, and perhaps even a cure for the disease! After several years and some remarkable students, it became increasingly clear that biochemistry had a role to play, and later yet, that the biological response of the tissues to flow and stress was also critical. This along with numerous other “learning experiences,” led to a transition in the way I viewed myself and how I sought to guide my students. Rather than being a fluid dynamicist with interests in human physiology and disease, I became a bioengineer with fluid mechanics as one of the several disciplines I could bring to bear on problems I felt were important and interesting to me. Recognizing bioengineering as a quintessential example of convergence fundamentally changed the way in which I approach a problem, as well as my goals and methods in mentoring students.Several years later, in the early 1990s, I found my work moving more in the direction of cell and molecular biology, a field in which I had no formal training. I was beginning to realize that cell culture work would be essential for me to advance my research into how airway epithelial cells respond to mechanical stimulus. I also felt that, if my lab was headed in this direction, I needed to gain some hands-on experience myself if I were to supervise students in related studies. While on sabbatical one year, I discussed this with a collaborator at the time, Jeffrey Drazen, then Chief of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at the Brigham and Women's Hospital. Together, we devised a plan to conduct experiments entirely on our own. Jeff would do the surgery on rats to obtain tracheal epithelial cells and I would do the cell culture, subject the cells to stress, and observe their responses. Despite numerous setbacks, and near catastrophes (such as my discarding down the drain a vial containing cells that Jeff had just painstakingly extracted from a rat trachea!), we blundered through the experience, managing to get the study to a point that I felt confident in handing it off to a (much more competent) student. That work eventually blossomed into a collaboration involving Doug Lauffenburger (cell signaling) and Peter So (two-photon imaging) and a few highly talented students/postdocs. A publication resulted some years later [4]. The take-home message here is threefold: (1) one should not be overly hesitant to enter a new field, (2) peer mentors can be extremely useful, and (3) if one hopes to mentor students effectively, one's own basic knowledge and hands-on experience are essential.The term “mentor” comes from Mentor in Greek mythology, the advisor to Odysseus, and while times have changed some since then (although some might argue that the challenges faced by Odysseus are no more daunting than those of finding an academic position!), the role of a mentor remains much the same—to impart advice and knowledge to those less experienced than yourself. The role of a mentor, in the broad sense intended here, is someone who takes a special interest in helping another person develops a successful professional career, with an appropriate balance between their professional and personal interests. Much has been written on mentoring. While I provide some references that I have found useful, what follows is a more personalized perspective, based on my own experiences over my years on the MIT faculty. I hope it will be helpful.To start, it is important to recognize that mentoring is not a case of “one size fits all.” It is our responsibility to first identify the special needs of each student. It is also important to understand the different approaches one might use in providing direction to and motivating a student to attain their full potential. In some cases, it becomes clear early on that a particular mentee has all the right instincts combined with exceptional capabilities. The best we can do as a mentor is to provide an environment in which they can thrive. The caution here is not to be overly directive or attempt to impose one's own personal style, but keep watch for any ways in which they can improve. Also, it is important to provide ample opportunities for them to expand their perspective, meet leading figures in the field, and engage in the full spectrum of educational experiences.Some students, however, come into your lab under-prepared, either academically or socially, or some might benefit from being directed to another profession or another career plan. In such cases, it pays to use an approach that helps the mentee make the best decisions for themselves. Our role as mentor is to raise questions that help them to better understand their own unique situation and to appreciate what alternative pathways might exist. Providing negative feedback is always a challenge, but both positive and negative input is essential in helping your mentees to make the right life decisions.Aside from the students and postdocs in our labs, we also have a wider responsibility to mentor those with whom our only contact is in the classroom or an occasional meeting outside of class. I do not intend to dwell on the role of mentoring in teaching, but it does represent another important responsibility and opportunity. The only word of advice I might offer in this connection is to stress the importance of maintaining a fresh outlook on the material. Always strive to see what you present in class from the perspective of someone learning the subject for the first time. Probably my most successful teaching experience (for which I received the Everett Moore Baker Memorial Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching, the only student initiated, Institute-wide award at MIT), was when I volunteered to teach a course that I had not previously taught and found that I had to re-learn the material alongside my students. It was a stressful, but extremely rewarding experience. It taught me the importance of never becoming isolated from your class. Do not forget the issues that are most difficult to comprehend for the first time. I also recall when Ascher Shapiro, my doctoral supervisor, first taught an undergraduate course in controls. He was close to retirement at the time and had just finished a ten-year stint as department head. I saw him struggle to fully grasp the concepts that he had never been taught, but then experience enormous satisfaction (and relief!) at the end of the term, both from the favorable response of the students, and from his own sense of accomplishment. This taught me the importance of always challenging oneself, not getting overly comfortable in the “scientific space” in which you live, and reminding me of the importance of seeing things from the perspective of my mentees.Mentoring is more than just being a friend, but having a good personal relationship with your mentee helps. I have found that it is best to listen first, then comment or provide feedback. And as the mentoring relationship matures, I find that the ratio of student input to my input progressively increases. If it does not, then that suggests to me that the student is not making good progress toward becoming an independent researcher, capable of both defining and executing their own ideas. Also, in the later stages, networking comes to the fore, since the student should be preparing for the next stage of their career. Helping the student make these connections, introducing them to visitors to the lab, including them in meetings with visitors, etc., are valuable ways in which a mentor can help the student effectively transition to independence.One of the most important facts to keep in mind is that most of your mentees will be doing something totally different from their graduate coursework or research in 5–10 years. Recognizing this, it is absolutely essential that they learn how to learn, and understand that learning is a lifetime experience.Some of my best experiences have been those in which a student has more than one mentor, so collaborations with other researchers, especially those with expertise complementary to that of your own lab, are key. And although these interactions can sometimes make it difficult to maintain focus, the added diversity of opinion they provide is well worth the effort.Collaborations within the lab are also important. There have been cases when I met with a student, only to discover that they were working on the same problem, or a problem with significant overlap with that of another student in the lab. Even when encouraged to initiate a discussion with the other student, and the benefits of doing so spelled out, sometimes the student was reluctant. This may stem from a false impression that reaching a goal through collaboration somehow lessens the significance of their role in the process. While it is true that collaboration often means sharing the limelight with a fellow student, and can lead to difficult decisions about authorship when it comes time to publish, the benefits reaped by faster progress far outweigh the negatives. Within a lab, and even across labs, collaboration and not competition moves the field ahead more quickly. It is our responsibility as mentors to initiate discussions about collaboration and to emphasize its benefits.In a larger lab, the more senior students or postdocs will often take on a mentoring role. This not only benefits the mentee, but also provides an opportunity for the senior individual to gain valuable experience in mentoring. The junior student gains from more hands-on support, often a tremendous benefit when just starting out. My own lab has grown from small to intermediate size, and now consists of about 15 members, ranging somewhat higher including undergraduates, visitors, or summer interns. Peer mentoring occurs naturally, as each student is generally happy to transfer their knowledge to a new lab member. Other than in the case of short-term visitors or undergraduates, I do not assign a direct mentor, but these evolve through relationships.Even greater challenges arise when starting a second lab, which is increasingly common these days with globalization of nearly everything, including research. I had such an opportunity in Singapore, starting in 2010, as part of the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology—SMART for short. There are many benefits and challenges to running a second lab, but it raises some unique mentoring issues. One often learns from one's mistakes, and in this instance, mine was in not recognizing the importance of being physically present for an extended period of time when starting the new lab; as good as videoconferencing has gotten, there is still no substitute for direct, personal interactions. Lab culture develops quickly, and the lab director needs to set the tone, which is best done by example and in person. My lab got past most of the initial problems that arose, but in retrospect, I felt that many could have been avoided simply by having been more present myself.I doubt that there are any labs that can avoid conflict completely, and as a mentor and lab director, it is important to expect it and be prepared to deal with it. Conflict can arise from various factors, but not infrequently results from unhealthy competition among lab members. Certainly, encouraging a collaborative spirit in the lab will help. But when conflict does come, it is critical to deal with it immediately, and take actions that send a clear signal that it would not be tolerated. My natural tendency is to avoid conflict, and I have at times been slow to act and slow to get to the core of the problem. This can have lasting negative consequences, however, and should be avoided by reacting quickly, fairly, and decisively.It is important helping your students to “step back” every now and then, so they do not get lost in the weeds. Periodically, a student should be asked to explain why their work is important, and how it all fits together. Doing so not only forces them to grasp or reinforce the importance of what they do, but has the added advantage of giving the mentor insight into whether or not the student is beginning to lose interest or motivation. In the extreme case, it might be necessary to ask the question: do you really want or need a higher degree?As your students and mentees progress through their career, their ability to communicate their thoughts, ideas, discoveries, and detailed findings will be critical to their success. Communication comes in many forms. Creating a compelling argument in support of your hypotheses is an essential skillset, in discussions with co-workers, advisors, and colleagues. This applies equally to those seeking an academic or industrial career. And for those looking to launch a start-up, the ability to effectively pitch your idea to a group of venture capitalists is paramount. Mentees need to understand that as an academic, presenting your work at a scientific meeting, writing technical papers, and discussing your research with colleagues are essential. Mentors should help mentees improve their writing and speaking skills, which can be time-consuming but well worth the effort.One question that often comes up is “should I discuss my new, unpublished findings with people outside of the lab?” With very few exceptions, my answer is an unequivocal “yes.” While different mentors may have other views, my feeling has always been that one gains the most from a scientific discussion if a sense of mutual openness and trust can be established. BioRχiv1 fosters this openness and should set the tone for all of our interactions. In the end, much of our communication, and our lasting legacy of research, resides in the papers that we publish. As Rik Huiskes, the long-time editor of the Journal of Biomechanics, is attributed to saying: “Unpublished work does not exist.”Finally, it is critical as a mentor to ensure open and frequent face-to-face communication with your mentees. Though not right for everyone, I have strived to maintain an open-door policy, encouraging my students to stop by at any time with any sort of question. If my door is closed, it is more often done by a student who might want to discuss a confidential matter, but I generally leave that to them to decide.As a young faculty member, obtaining and publishing results in a timely manner, while always a high priority, is even more critical. As a more senior mentor, one finds that the need to quickly publish diminishes. However, one cannot overlook the need of one's mentees to bring their research to a point of publication. It is a key to ensure that the essential new ideas of a young investigator be published in a timely fashion in today's competitive environment. Regardless of the mentor's seniority, the goal should always be to generate publications that represent a significant new contribution to the literature, and that are fully developed and presented, yet remaining sensitive to the timing of the mentee's career plans and progression.One of the key roles of a mentor and group leader is to instill in your mentees the importance of maintaining diversity, in every dimension, in the lab composition. As mentors, we must demonstrate through our actions that our profession benefits tremendously from it. It has been satisfying to see the increasing number of women, underrepresented minorities, and members of the LGBT community in bioengineering, and their obvious success at every level. Though not yet at the numbers we would like to see, the growth is obvious as we look around. Still, biases exist that sometimes prevent individual members of these groups from attaining their full potential, as documented recently in a New York Times article [5]. As mentors, we have the responsibility to reflect through our actions that all should have equal opportunity, and that each individual deserves the respect and treatment.With the ever-growing emphasis on publishing first-authored, “high impact” papers, pressures build, especially for those planning to enter an academic career. This often becomes a major focus and can sometimes obscure the more important reasons for publishing—such as describing an important finding to move the field forward. As a result, I have noticed an increasing trend over the years: the number of co-authors on a paper is growing, and there is a growing tendency for disagreements to erupt when decisions are made regarding co-author ordering. While it is one thing to follow good practices and discuss co-authorship well in advance [6], especially in a new collaboration, these discussions often seem premature, and can even give rise to problems later on as the focus of the paper shifts or the relative contributions of the different contributors wind up being different from first planned. There is no single solution to this, but it helps if the issue is raised periodically, and both the mentors and their mentees feel that whatever decision is finally made, it will be based on a reasonable set of guidelines understood and agreed to by everyone.There is another dimension to ethics that is becoming increasingly important in our profession. Our lab has benefited from interactions with bioethicists through our work on multicellular engineered living systems. Recognizing that these living systems exhibit, either now or in the foreseeable future, many of the attributes of “life” (self-assembly, self-repair, ability to adapt to a changing environment, capability to gather and process information and take some action based on that stimulus) mandates that we address these real potentialities today. Also, we must make our students aware of the ethical questions that might arise. This is already happening as the NIH begins to apply some of the same restrictions on use of organoids derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells. While it is certain that our ability to grow organs or other implanted systems with unique capabilities will continue to expand, important questions will continue to arise about broad access to and affordability of these new technologies. In our NSF-funded Science and Technology Center on Emergent Behaviors of Integrated Cellular Systems, we have become increasingly engaged with the bioethics community, and now regularly include an ethics component in our retreats, workshops, and other center activities. I have found this to be a natural way to raise questions in our lab meetings and through interactions with my mentees regarding all aspects of ethical conduct.I hope that for those of you who reach this point, the read has been worthwhile. You now have my reflections on mentoring, which I hope convey some of the tremendous body of experience I have gained through my interactions with Bob Nerem. However, what works for one person does not necessarily work for the next, so it is always somewhat risky to offer advice. But I expect that my experiences are fairly representative of those we all face as we attempt to provide guidance to our lab members and junior colleagues, and that at least parts of this article will prove useful to you. If so, then I will claim success!",W2973063692,True,0.9542583227157593
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013245,Evolution of foraging behaviour induces variable complexity-stability relationships in mutualist-exploiter-predator communities,"Early ecological theory predicts that complex ecological networks are unstable and are unlikely to persist, despite many empirical studies of such complexity in nature. This inconsistency has fascinated ecologists for decades. To resolve the complexity-stability debate, coupling population dynamics and trait dynamics is considered to be an important way to understand the long-term stability of ecological community assemblages. However, we still do not know how eco-evolutionary feedbacks affect the relationship between complexity and stability in ecologically realistic networks with both antagonistic and mutualistic interactions. Here, we explored an adaptive network model to evaluate how the evolution of foraging preference to determine the relationship between network complexity (i.e., connectance) and stability (i.e., community persistence at steady state) in mutualist-exploiter-predator communities (MEST). Our theoretical results showed: (i) adaptive foraging of the top predator contributes to the stability of mutualism and intermediate intensity of foraging adaptations can lead to chaotic dynamics in a four-species MEST community; (ii) the complexity-stability relationship may show positive monotonic, negative monotonic, peaked and double-peaked patterns in general MEST communities, while the double-peaked pattern is only obtained when both the adaptation intensity and interspecific competition are high. Furthermore, model predictions may be consistent with both the negative monotonic pattern revealed in freshwater communities and the peaked pattern revealed in marine communities. Finally, we infer that foraging adaptations of the top predator may alter positive or/and negative feedback loops (trait-mediated indirect effects) to affect the stability of general MEST communities. Our adaptive network framework may provide an effective way to address the complexity-stability debate in real ecosystems.",W4412124513,True,0.9951501488685608
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.14451,Fitness differences override variation‐dependent coexistence mechanisms in California grasslands,"Abstract While most studies of species coexistence focus on the mechanisms that maintain coexistence, it is equally important to understand the mechanisms that structure failed coexistence. For example, California annual grasslands are heavily invaded ecosystems, where non‐native annuals have largely dominated and replaced native communities. These systems are also highly variable, with a high degree of rainfall seasonality and interannual rainfall variability—a quality implicated in the coexistence of functionally distinct species. Yet, despite the apparent strength of this variation, coexistence between native and non‐native annuals in this system has faltered. To test how variation‐dependent coexistence mechanisms modulate failed coexistence, we implemented a competition experiment between two previously common native forbs and three now‐dominant non‐native annual grasses spanning a conservative‐acquisitive range of traits. We grew individuals from each species under varying densities of all other species as competitors, under either wetter or drier early season rainfall treatments. Using subsequent seed production, we parameterized competition models, assessed the potential for coexistence among species pairs and quantified the relative influence of variation‐dependent coexistence mechanisms. As expected, we found little potential for coexistence. Competition was dominated by the non‐native grass Avena fatua, while native forbs were unable to invade non‐native grasses. Mutual competitive exclusion was common across almost all species and often contingent on rainfall, suggesting rainfall‐mediated priority effects. Among variation‐dependent mechanisms, the temporal storage effect had a moderate stabilizing effect for four of five species when averaged across competitors, while relative nonlinearity in competition was largely destabilizing, except for the most conservative non‐native grass, which benefited from a competitive release under dry conditions. Synthesis : Our findings suggest that rainfall variability does little to mitigate the fitness differences that underlie widespread annual grass invasion in California, but that it influences coexistence dynamics among the now‐dominant non‐native grasses.",W4404641610,True,0.9876667857170105
https://doi.org/10.25932/publishup-47941,Using individual-based modeling to understand grassland diversity and resilience in the Anthropocene,"The world’s grassland systems are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic change. Susceptible to a variety of different stressors, from land-use intensification to climate change, understanding the mechanisms driving the maintenance of these systems’ biodiversity and stability, and how these mechanisms may shift under human-mediated disturbance, is thus critical for successfully navigating the next century. Within this dissertation, I use an individual-based and spatially-explicit model of grassland community assembly (IBC-grass) to examine several processes, thought key to understanding their biodiversity and stability and how it changes under stress. In the first chapter of my thesis, I examine the conditions under which intraspecific trait variation influences the diversity of simulated grassland communities. In the second and third chapters of my thesis, I shift focus towards understanding how belowground herbivores influence the stability of these grassland systems to either a disturbance that results in increased, stochastic, plant mortality, or eutrophication. Intraspecific trait variation (ITV), or variation in trait values between individuals of the same species, is fundamental to the structure of ecological communities. However, because it has historically been difficult to incorporate into theoretical and statistical models, it has remained largely overlooked in community-level analyses. This reality is quickly shifting, however, as a consensus of research suggests that it may compose a sizeable proportion of the total variation within an ecological community and that it may play a critical role in determining if species coexist. Despite this increasing awareness that ITV matters, there is little consensus of the magnitude and direction of its influence. Therefore, to better understand how ITV changes the assembly of grassland communities, in the first chapter of my thesis, I incorporate it into an established, individual-based grassland community model, simulating both pairwise invasion experiments as well as the assembly of communities with varying initial diversities. By varying the amount of ITV in these species’ functional traits, I examine the magnitude and direction of ITV’s influence on pairwise invasibility and community coexistence. During pairwise invasion, ITV enables the weakest species to more frequently invade the competitively superior species, however, this influence does not generally scale to the community level. Indeed, unless the community has low alpha- and beta- diversity, there will be little effect of ITV in bolstering diversity. In these situations, since the trait axis is sparsely filled, the competitively inferior may suffer less competition and therefore ITV may buffer the persistence and abundance of these species for some time. In the second and third chapters of my thesis, I model how one of the most ubiquitous trophic interactions within grasslands, herbivory belowground, influences their diversity and stability. Until recently, the fundamental difficulty in studying a process within the soil has left belowground herbivory “out of sight, out of mind.” This dilemma presents an opportunity for simulation models to explore how this understudied process may alter community dynamics. In the second chapter of my thesis, I implement belowground herbivory – represented by the weekly removal of plant biomass – into IBC-grass. Then, by introducing a pulse disturbance, modelled as the stochastic mortality of some percentage of the plant community, I observe how the presence of belowground herbivores influences the resistance and recovery of Shannon diversity in these communities. I find that high resource, low diversity, communities are significantly more destabilized by the presence of belowground herbivores after disturbance. Depending on the timing of the disturbance and whether the grassland’s seed bank persists for more than one season, the impact of the disturbance – and subsequently the influence of the herbivores – can be greatly reduced. However, because human-mediated eutrophication increases the amount of resources in the soil, thus pressuring grassland systems, our results suggest that the influence of these herbivores may become more important over time. In the third chapter of my thesis, I delve further into understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of belowground herbivores on the diversity of grasslands by replicating an empirical mesocosm experiment that crosses the presence of herbivores above- and below-ground with eutrophication. I show that while aboveground herbivory, as predicted by theory and frequently observed in experiments, mitigates the impact of eutrophication on species diversity, belowground herbivores counterintuitively reduce biodiversity. Indeed, this influence positively interacts with the eutrophication process, amplifying its negative impact on diversity. I discovered the mechanism underlying this surprising pattern to be that, as the herbivores consume roots, they increase the proportion of root resources to root biomass. Because root competition is often symmetric, herbivory fails to mitigate any asymmetries in the plants’ competitive dynamics. However, since the remaining roots have more abundant access to resources, the plants’ competition shifts aboveground, towards asymmetric competition for light. This leads the community towards a low-diversity state, composed of mostly high-performance, large plant species. We further argue that this pattern will emerge unless the plants’ root competition is asymmetric, in which case, like its counterpart aboveground, belowground herbivory may buffer diversity by reducing this asymmetry between the competitively superior and inferior plants. I conclude my dissertation by discussing the implications of my research on the state of the art in intraspecific trait variation and belowground herbivory, with emphasis on the necessity of more diverse theory development in the study of these fundamental interactions. My results suggest that the influence of these processes on the biodiversity and stability of grassland systems is underappreciated and multidimensional, and must be thoroughly explored if researchers wish to predict how the world’s grasslands will respond to anthropogenic change. Further, should researchers myopically focus on understanding central ecological interactions through only mathematically tractable analyses, they may miss entire suites of potential coexistence mechanisms that can increase the coviability of species, potentially leading to coexistence over ecologically-significant timespans. Individual-based modelling, therefore, with its focus on individual interactions, will prove a critical tool in the coming decades for understanding how local interactions scale to larger contexts, and how these interactions shape ecological communities and further predicting how these systems will change under human-mediated stress.",W3154438755,True,0.9849386811256409
https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.14416,In Memoriam: Barry Sinervo 1961–2021,"In March 2021, evolutionary biologist and ecologist Professor Barry Sinervo at University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) passed away at the age of 60, after a brave struggle with cancer (Fig. 1). Barry is mourned by his wife of 32 years Jeanie Vogelzang, his son Ari Sinervo, and other family members. His premature death has also caused much sorrow among his departmental colleagues at UCSC, scientific collaborators around the world, and former students and postdocs, including the authors of the current piece. Here, we summarize Barry's scientific achievements, discuss his legacy, and provide some personal memories of our interactions with him when carrying out research in his laboratory. Those of us writing this article are former postdocs and PhD students who all spent considerable time in Barry's laboratory, and we wish to share some of the intellectual excitement we experienced during these formative years of our academic careers. Together, our team covers a large time span of Barry's faculty career, and the authors of this piece include Barry's first PhD student (R.C.), his first European postdoc (E.I.S), his last PhD student (P.B.) as well as his co-workers, students, and laboratory members in between these periods (A.M.A., L.L., and S.C.M.), from 1997 and onwards. Barry started his scientific career by earning a B.Sc. in biology and mathematics at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. He then joined the Department of Zoology at Washington University, under the supervision of Professor Raymond Huey. It was during these early formative years that Barry developed the classical experimental protocols that would subsequently establish him as a young and rising star in evolutionary biology: experimental techniques to manipulate egg and offspring size, that he termed “allometric engineering.” By experimentally removing part of the yolk from eggs of two species of sea urchins (Strongolycentrotus) and later also Western Fence Lizards (Scleroporos occidentalis) and side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana), Barry and his colleagues explored the fitness and performance consequences of maternal effects and early developmental history on offspring (Fig. 1B). This pioneering experimental work resulted in a series of classic and highly influential papers published in Evolution and Science (Sinervo and McEdward 1988; Sinervo 1990; Sinervo and Huey 1990; Sinervo et al. 1992). Barry's early work illustrates his interest in both development and ecology, and how a knowledge of both fields is crucial to understand evolution. Barry was an early pioneer in linking ecology to development and evolution, well before the later rapid growth of evolutionary developmental biology (“evo-devo”) as an emerging and increasingly popular research topic. Barry's experimental manipulations of offspring size revealed the mechanistic links between size and offspring performance, including how ecologically important traits like sprint speed are important for lizards to escape predators and the general importance of allometric size-performance relationships. These classical experimental phenotypic manipulations also revealed the importance of early environmental effects and offspring development, which many biologists nowadays appreciate as being fundamental to understand both ecological and evolutionary dynamics of natural populations. It provided the foundation that established him as a truly integrative evolutionary biologist. This work also earned him the Society for the Study of Evolution's (SSE) Theodosius Dobzhansky Prize in 1992, and a Young Investigator Award from the American Society of Naturalists. Interestingly, Barry's advisor Ray Huey did not believe that these experimental manipulations would work and advised him against doing them, but he was happy to be proven wrong when they turned out successful (R. Huey, pers. commun.). This episode underscores that PhD students should not always follow the advice of senior supervisors and that pushing through ideas you really believe in can lead to scientific innovations. After defending his PhD in Seattle, Barry subsequently moved to UC Berkeley, where he obtained the prestigious Miller postdoctoral fellowship, working with the endocrinologist Professor Paul Licht. During this time in Berkeley, Barry developed his interests in the mechanistic and developmental basis of life-history variation. He designed experimental endocrinological manipulations on female side-blotched lizards with the aim of understanding the trade-off between egg quantity and egg quality. By experimentally manipulating circulating levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in females, he showed in a paper in Journal of Experimental Zoology that this hormone had pleiotropic effects on both traits: it simultaneously increased egg number and decreased egg size as a correlated effect (Sinervo and Licht 1991a). This was a groundbreaking experiment that resulted in a paper in Science (Sinervo and Licht 1991b) and which established a concrete and mechanistic proof-of-principle of the theory that life-history trade-offs were likely to emerge as a result of antagonistic pleiotropy of genes with effects on several different traits, as discussed in a later publication by Barry in American Naturalist (Sinervo 1999). After obtaining faculty positions as professor, first in Bloomington at Indiana University and subsequently at UCSC, Barry continued to study side-blotched lizards in an individually marked field population at Los Baños (Merced County) in California (Fig. 1C). He chose this study location after driving around a large part of California, scouting out different sites that would be suitable for a long-term population study of marked individuals. Once Barry had settled on the field site at Los Baños, he continued to use his experimental techniques and applied them in the field, aiming to understand how natural selection shaped life-history evolution in a realistic ecological setting. The landscape at Los Baños is characterized by dry, grassy areas and rolling hills, where enormous numbers of lizards live in high density on semi-isolated rocky outcroppings (Fig. 1C). Although these little animals are fleet of foot (Barry would have called them “wiley”), he had mastered the art of capture and routinely captured and processed more than 100 individuals per day. Those of us who participated in the field work at Los Baños often participated in daily competition with Barry to catch as many lizards as he did, but he was typically able to catch more than the rest of the team combined during a whole day, which says a lot about his outstanding skills as a field biologist. It was after several years of field work at Los Baños that Barry discovered and described the evolutionary and social dynamics leading to perhaps his most famous paper in Nature in 1996: “The rock-paper-scissors game and the evolution of alternative male strategies” (Sinervo and Lively 1996) (Fig. 1D). Together with his colleague Curtis Lively (still at Indiana University), they described three heritable male throat color morphs that persist in this population, while fluctuating in their relative frequencies every generation (Sinervo and Lively 1996). Based on field data and game theoretical modeling, Barry and Curt argued that this polymorphism was maintained by a particular form of negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS), namely a rock-paper-scissor game (RPS), in which the different morphs showed intransitive fitnesses, each morph having its own strengths and weaknesses in intrasexual selection and competition over access to females and mating opportunities (Maynard Smith 1996). RPS had previously been a theoretical idea, explored by the evolutionary theorist John Maynard Smith, but here was a possible case of its operation and existence in a natural population in the wild. It is fair to say that the RPS-paper was met with some skepticism by many evolutionary biologists and the idea does not seem to have had a big impact on the field of behavioral ecology. However, outside of behavioral ecology, intransitive fitnesses in general, and the RPS-paper in particular, have had a huge impact in fields like theoretical evolutionary biology, biodiversity, adaptive radiations, community ecology, evolutionary genetics, and microbial experimental evolution (Rainey and Travisano 1998; Palumbi 1999; Czárán et al. 2002; Kerr et al. 2002; Zhang et al. 2013; Arnold 2020). We strongly suspect one reason why behavioral ecologists have not fully embraced the concept of intransitive fitnesses and the RPS is a cultural barrier: in the behavioral ecology tradition, there is often a strong focus on evolutionary endpoints and optima, rather than on the dynamics of the evolutionary process. To be fair, Barry had a tendency to oversell the RPS, and the dynamical complexity within Barry's conceptual evolutionary models sometimes became intractable. Barry strongly rejected simpler concepts such as indirect genetic effects (IGE) arising from social and parental interactions (Wolf et al. 2001) that could potentially explain the observed patterns. Barry claimed that these more simplified approaches sacrificed mechanistic insight to tractability at the cost of understanding. This position reflects Barry's integrative approach, which aimed to merge genetics, development, physiology, and mathematics to understand the evolutionary process. Barry therefore did not shrink from complexity and attempted to understand rather than minimize its impact. The last words about the RPS and the male color polymorphism have probably not been said, but we strongly suspect that Barry got the major picture right about how this and other forms of enigmatic behavioral polymorphisms are maintained. In 1998, interested in studying dispersal in the side-blotched lizards, Barry visited Jean Clobert in Paris. Barry and Jean immediately had passionate discussions about how dispersal could be linked with the three color morph system. Barry visited Jean's captive common lizards at Foljuif (south of Paris) and to Jean's surprise they discovered that female common lizards also displayed some color morphs. From this first encounter, a long-term collaboration between Barry and Jean was established primarily focused on color morphs, the role of corticosterone, and the effects of climate change. In common with many of us, Jean has data and experiments that he carried out with Barry that are still to be published. Jean treasures Barry's personality and will forever remember the intense scientific discussions they had over the years. A common theme in all our memories of Barry is that he was certainly one of the rare people with whom we have had such rich scientific exchanges. Several of us in the group shared Barry's strong interests in maternal effects, and particularly the idea that maternal physiology could be a powerful way to translate social dynamics into offspring developmental trajectories. This work led to a series of papers on the role of early environmental and maternal effects and the effects on phenotypic integration, including how egg size and maternal hormone investment can trigger changes in phenotype to successfully integrate each mating type with effective antipredator strategies (Lancaster et al. 2007, 2010; Paranjpe et al. 2013). This work was strongly facilitated by Barry's curiosity-driven research efforts, aiming to link social environments with physiology and with the aim to understand the complexity of dynamic evolutionary processes. In addition to his papers, Barry also leaves behind a global network of scientists grateful for their time spent interacting with him and others in the vibrant environment he created in his laboratory. The authors of the current piece all spent some of our formative years in Barry's laboratory. The insights we gained by interacting with Barry and other members of the laboratory were instrumental for us in our subsequent research careers. Below, we include some personal anecdotes to provide a general flavor of the unique and extremely creative research environment that we experienced in Barry's laboratory. One of us (E.I.S.) joined Barry's laboratory as a postdoc at UCSC in 1997, when Barry was a young faculty member (36 years) and had just started his position. E.I.S. was Barry's first postdoc, and came from Sweden where he had mainly been exposed to classical behavioral ecology during his PhD. It was somewhat of a cultural and scientific shock being exposed to a new way of thinking in Barry's laboratory, where population genetics, development, and big questions in evolutionary biology were discussed during laboratory meetings and during commutes to the field site at Los Baños. Initially, E.I.S. found himself in doubt over the basic story about the lizard throat color polymorphism and the causes of its evolutionary maintenance, and he was not alone in the laboratory in these feelings. Working with Barry in the field, compiling data and performing experimental investigations gradually convinced E.I.S. that this polymorphism was indeed a real phenomenon in demand of explanation. Together with Barry and several other colleagues in the laboratory, including A.M.A., we also explored the dynamics of the color polymorphism in females, its fitness consequences and genetic background, and documented striking genetic correlations between color, immune function, and life-history traits (Sinervo et al. 2000; Sinervo and Svensson 2002; Svensson et al. 2009). Another one of us (S.C.M.) met Barry while he was in Finland as the external examiner of a PhD thesis in 2002, was encouraged to apply for funding, and would go on to visit his laboratory every spring for 4 years from 2003 to 2006. One year, together with L.T.L. and Donald Miles, we decided to investigate proximate mechanisms behind the behavioral, physiological, and morphological differences of the different color morphs. In true Barry style, we carried out a natural selection experiment in the field, investigating selection on suites of hormone-mediated traits. Rather than manipulating testosterone (T) and corticosterone, Barry was enthusiastic to look at the upstream gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) that regulate T to highlight endocrine cascades. Through manipulations of LH and FSH, whose natural expression is thought to be under genetic control, we also showed that the responses to hormones in the different color morphs were at least partly adaptive. For example, the yellow-throated male morph is more plastic and can upregulate these hormones opportunistically, whereas the other morphs lack such plasticity (Mills et al. 2008). Despite the scale of these projects, the laboratory was a well-oiled machine with lizards in multiple coolers arriving to be processed and then returning to the field. Even when S.C.M was isolated at home with TB (which Barry diagnosed in 5 minutes though it had baffled doctors for months), the coolers kept on coming, the doorbell would ring and the cooler would be left there on the doorstep! When P.B. (Barry's last PhD student) told her then herpetology professor, Dr. Jim Archie at Cal State Long Beach that she had been accepted into Barry's laboratory, he dropped everything to give her a huge hug in his excitement for her to enter into the laboratory of one of the greats. Barry's influential RPS work, textbook material in her undergraduate courses, left P.B. feeling slightly intimidated to join a laboratory with such a big name. Although Barry was a big name with big ideas, he had an equally big heart. Barry lived and breathed for the lizards, so much so that even in the trenches of his fight with cancer and in the worst of the COVID pandemic, to preserve the work and isolate himself he lived in an old trailer on the field site itself so he did not have to make the long drives to and from his home. His dedication was admirable. Barry certainly never thought small, and it was exciting to be involved in his large ideas. We try to continue this legacy today and encourage our students not to shy away from whole-organismal performance experiments. We also repeat more trivial but amusing day to day quotes from Barry, such as the five Ps: Prior Planning Prevents Poor Performance, an important classic as Lizard land was a couple of hours drive away from the laboratory. Barry also leapt at any occasion to teach, such as the time one of us (S.C.M) chose a rock to sit on whilst filling in field notes. The rock was hiding a rattlesnake coming out of hibernation which soon let us know of its presence, but unaccustomed to this sound, it took Barry's shout of RUN! to get S.C.M. moving. Once scattered field notes had been retrieved and Barry's laughter had subsided, he proceeded with a short, but detailed and interesting description of how that rattle would forever be embedded in her amygdala and hippocampus. The formative years in Barry's laboratory stimulated our interests in correlational selection (selection for different character combinations), genetic and phenotypic polymorphisms, adaptive landscape theory and its various applications. Our interests in adaptive landscape theory and applications were also partly stimulated by the physical landscape of the dry, rolling grassy hills at Los Baños and “Lizard Land.” Indeed, Barry would often wax poetic on the long drives to California's great Central Valley, comparing the rugged landscapes of the Diablo range to Sewall Wright's adaptation heuristic. These long drives were an important resource for all of us, as they provided rare opportunities to gain uninterrupted access to Barry, whose pace of work (both physical and intellectual) were so intense that he was otherwise tough to pin down. We drove to the field site together each day, riding in Barry's filthy 1986 Toyota 4runner. Whoever sat up front with Barry on the ride home had nearly 2 hours of private audience to chat, while the others, exhausted from a long day under the hot Valley sun, would sleep in a pile in the backseat. Barry was just as happy to talk about science and natural history, as he was to recount stories of his metaphysical experiences with a crow in the desert, but in the background, his mind was always turning over the problem of natural selection acting on the lizards with those brightly colored throats. As a result of the vibrant intellectual atmosphere in Barry's laboratory, E.I.S. and R.C. (who was one of Barry's first PhD students) some years later edited a joint volume about adaptive landscapes together (Svensson and Calsbeek 2012). L.T.L. later across the Atlantic to Sweden became a postdoc in the laboratory of E.I.S., eventually establishing herself as faculty member at University of Aberdeen in the UK. Barry was half-Finnish and thanks to his mother was fluent in Finnish. In 2004 in Jyväskylä (Finland), Barry astonished the audience, and delighted the Finns, at the 10th Jubilee Congress of the International Society for Behavioral Ecology (ISBE), by starting his plenary in Finnish. One half of the audience was certainly shocked as 5 minutes into his talk, Barry was still speaking in Finnish! Otherwise, Barry was never very fond of going to international conferences but he traveled extensively and had a huge international network of collaborators all over the world. His laboratory was surely an intellectually very stimulating and international arena, where many long-term friendships and close collaborations were initiated, with or without his active involvement. We are very grateful for this indirect influence that Barry had on our research careers and that emerged more or less spontaneously in the stimulating but also challenging environment that his laboratory constituted with many brilliant and creative minds flourishing and joining from different parts of North America, Europe, and many other parts of the world. E.I.S. and L.T.L also remember being introduced by Barry to some classics in evolutionary biology, such as William Provine (1971), Richard Levins (1968), and Richard Lewontin, in particular The Dialectical Biologist (Levins and Lewontin 1985). Barry had a remarkable breadth of knowledge in the history of ecology and evolutionary biology, including philosophy and dialectical thinking. This knowledge base clearly influenced the way he thought about science, carried out his research, and supervised his students and postdocs. During the last part of Barry's career, from 2008 and until his premature death in March 2021, his research efforts were mainly directed toward problems of ongoing climate change and its potentially disastrous consequences in terms of increased extinction risks of animal populations. Barry and a large team of collaborators from all over the world published a highly cited paper in Science in 2010, where they highlighted and described the risks of altered thermal niches and elevated extinction risks of lizards in the face of rapid climate change and global warming (Sinervo et al. 2010). Barry also co-authored another influential study documenting the collapse of desert bird communities in the Californian Sonoran desert, which was also attributed to climate change (Riddell et al. 2019). Although the lizard study was later criticized by other researchers who questioned the alarming conclusions that 39% of lizard populations and 20% of species would go extinct by 2080 (Clusella-Trullas and Chown 2011), Barry and his colleagues responded to these criticisms and maintained their pessimistic message (Sinervo et al. 2011). Only time will tell whether Barry and his colleagues were correct, but there are other worrying studies indicating that climate-mediated extinctions might already be happening in taxa other than lizards (Wiens 2016; Lister and Garcia 2018). Barry's worry and engagement with the threats from climate change were sincere. Whether one agrees or disagrees with his pessimism about a forthcoming and dramatic wave of climate-mediated extinctions of lizards, his family members encourage all those who want to honor Barry's memory and work to donate to the climate movement and organization “350 Org” ( which fights for a sustainable future and for a transition to a better future free of fossil fuels. Finally, it might be worth reflecting about how Barry saw his research on climate-mediated extinction risks being related—if at all—to his earlier work in more basic science in life-history evolution, sexual selection, game theory, and color polymorphisms. We have also asked ourselves this question, and are quite confident that he did not view these lines of research as being separate lines of inquiry, but rather as reflecting his general curiosity in understanding our natural world and life on this fragile planet. His later work on how temperature conditions and early environmental effects interacted with lizard throat colour exemplifies such integrative science, spanning climate change research, sexual selection, and life-history evolution (Paranjpe et al. 2013). Barry was unfortunately unable to complete his research and provide a general summary of his different research themes, but he was thinking deeply about how to apply game theory to accelerate the transition from a world dominated by fossil fuels to a more sustainable future. He was also thinking about how to apply RPS-related ideas to understand the universe at large, plans that he mentioned to E.I.S. in their last physical meeting in Santa Cruz in January 2020. We finish this obituary by noting that there is a growing research interest and attention to how climate change and temperature can affect sexual selection, sexual conflict, and the evolution of color polymorphisms (Lancaster et al. 2017; García-Roa et al. 2020; Svensson et al. 2020). We are sure that Barry would have been delighted and excited by these recent developments.

https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.70051,Local‐ and Regional‐Scale Climate Variability Drives Complex Patterns of Growth Synchrony and Asynchrony in Deep‐Sea Snappers Across the Indo‐Pacific,"ABSTRACT Climatic variation can play a critical role in driving synchronous and asynchronous patterns in the expression of life history characteristics across vast spatiotemporal scales. The synchronisation of traits, such as an individual's growth rate, under environmental stress may indicate a loss of phenotypic diversity and thus increased population vulnerability to stochastic deleterious events. In contrast, synchronous growth under favourable ecological conditions and asynchrony during unfavourable conditions may help population resilience and buffer against the negative implications of future environmental variability. Despite the significant implications of growth synchrony and asynchrony to population productivity and persistence, little is known about its causes and consequences either within or among fish populations. This is especially true for long‐lived deep‐sea species that inhabit environments characterised by large‐scale interannual and decadal changes, which could propagate growth synchrony across vast distances. We developed otolith growth chronologies for three deep‐sea fishes ( Etelis spp.) over 65° of longitude and 20° of latitude across the Indo‐Pacific region. Using reconstructed time series of interannual growth from six distinct Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), we assessed the level of spatial synchrony at the individual‐, population‐ and species‐scale. Across five decades of data, complex patterns of synchronous and asynchronous growth were apparent for adult populations within and among EEZs of the Pacific Ocean, mediated by shifts in oceanographic phenomena such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Overall, our results indicate that the degree of synchrony in biological traits at depth depends on life history stage, spatiotemporal scales of environmental variability and the influence of ecological factors such as competition and dispersal. By determining the magnitude and timing of spatially synchronous growth at depth and its links to environmental variability, we can better understand fluctuations in deep‐sea productivity and its vulnerability to future environmental stressors, which are key considerations for sustainability.",W4407150852,True,0.9743901491165161
https://doi.org/10.1002/eco.2215,"Comment on ‘Kidron, G. J. (2018). Biocrust research: A critical view on eight common hydrological‐related paradigms and dubious theses. <i>Ecohydrology</i>, e2061’","Kidron (2018) uses a straw man argument in an attempt to debunk eight putative hydrological-related paradigms he believes to be “common among hydrologists, ecologists, or microbiologists that investigate biocrusts.” These paradigms relate to the roles of physical crusts and vascular plants in biocrust development, the major drivers (climate, porosity, hydrophobicity, and exopolysaccharides) of hydrology (infiltration and runoff), and the effect of mosses on hydrology and therefore vascular plants. We see two major problems with his arguments. First, they assume that the paradigms in question are generally accepted by biocrust researchers. Second, they are based on Kidron's (2018) world view of biocrusts, which has largely been informed by his own studies from a single, distinctly unique area of sand dunes at the Nizzana Research Site in the Negev Desert, Israel. This narrow focus and the selective use of published material disqualify his arguments. Our collective experience, based on more than 250 person years of biocrust research, and more than 700 scientific publications on biocrusts from all continents including Antarctica, indicates that, far from the straw man arguments proposed by Kidron (2018), there is no evidence to support the existence of a unifying theory that captures the global effects of biocrusts on hydrology. Our collective works demonstrate that, contrary to claims by Kidron (2018), the hydrological effects of biocrusts are strongly nuanced, varying with, but not limited to, differences in ecological context, landscape position, site condition, crust type and composition, climatic zone, soil texture and porosity, surface morphology, and spatial scale (reviewed in Weber, Büdel, & Belnap, 2016). Below, we critically analyse each of Kidron's (2018) paradigms, providing rigorous empirical evidence to show that none represent commonly held views among the biocrust research community. Biocrusts often colonize physical crusts, which are commonly interspersed with biocrusts (Chamizo, Belnap, Eldridge, Cantón, & Malam Issa, 2016; Chamizo, Cantón, Lázaro, Solé-Benet, & Domingo, 2012; Malam Issa et al., 2011). Biocrusts require a degree of physical stability, which can arise from an association with not only physical soil crusts but also soil fines, organic matter or aggregates, vascular plant stems, or, as Kidron (2018) suggests, exopolysaccharides (EPS) secreted by the biocrust organisms themselves (Hu, Liu, Smestad Paulsen, Petersen, & Klaveness, 2003; Mugnai et al., 2018). The stabilizing effects of EPS have been known for decades (Chesters, Attoe, & Allen, 1957; Mazor, Kidron, Vonshak, & Abeliovich, 1996; Underwood, Paterson, & Parkes, 1995; Van Ancker, Jungerius, & Mur, 1985). Similarly, many studies, often cited by Kidron, attest to dust capture by biocrusts (Danin & Ganor, 1991; Felde, Chamizo, Felix-Henningsen, & Drahorad, 2018; Felde, Peth, Uteau-Puschmann, Drahorad, & Felix-Henningsen, 2014; McTainsh & Strong, 2007; Reynolds, Belnap, Reheis, Lamothe, & Luiszer, 2001; Williams, Buck, & Beyene, 2012), a mechanism that is important for biocrust stability and nutrient cycling. Kidron (2018) asserts that soil fines can hasten biocrust colonization and growth (Mugnai, Rossi, Chamizo, Adessi, & De Philippis, 2020; Rozenstein et al., 2014; Zaady, Katra, Barkai, Knoll, & Sarig, 2017) but is citing the absence of biocrusts from playas at the Nizzana site as proof that fines do not facilitate biocrust formation. Playa surfaces, however, are biologically hostile, subject to periods of extreme sedimentation or inundation, and often highly saline (Blume, Beyer, Pfisterer, & Felix-Henningsen, 2008), a point overlooked in this paradigm. In summary, a critical review of the literature reveals that biocrusts are often interwoven with physical crusts and dust, but physical crusts are not necessarily precursors to biocrust establishment. We know from recent extensive meta-analyses that the effects of biocrusts on plants are complex, strongly nuanced, and driven by crust type and biocrust traits (Havrilla et al., 2019). An overwhelming body of evidence points to the opposite view to that advanced in Paradigm 2 by Kidron (2018). Best available evidence indicates that biocrusts prime surface soils with water and nutrients and facilitate the establishment of vascular plants (Lan et al., 2014; Langhans, Storm, & Schwabe, 2009; X. J. Li et al., 2008; Rodríguez-Caballero, Chamizo, Roncero-Ramos, Román, & Cantón, 2018). We also know that some moss and lichen species benefit from their association with moisture-rich habitats, which could be provided by nurse plants (Jiang et al., 2018), but could equally result from shading by rocks, or their location at lower landscape positions that receive additional run-on water (Lan et al., 2014; Williams, Buck, Soukup, & Merkler, 2013; Yair, 1990). Thus, it is clear that plant establishment per se is not a precursor for biocrust establishment on dunes. Paradigm 3 is based on the observation that filamentous cyanobacteria are the first pioneering photosynthetic organisms to colonize disturbed soils, hence, the putative link to biocrust successional stage, irrespective of desert type. As biocrusts develop, the trajectory of change and the resulting species composition will depend on abiotic factors such as climate, soils, and specific microclimatic conditions. In more mesic environments, high biomass and developmental stage are likely synonymous. In more arid environments, however, later stages of development are likely to be limited by the lack of moisture, so that biocrusts will remain dominated by cyanobacteria or cyanolichens. In many environments, a mixture of different patch types and resource levels will result in a mixture of successional stages within the same site, a phenomenon acknowledged by Kidron (2018). Thus, Paradigm 3 applies to some environments (Belnap & Eldridge, 2003) but is not globally consistent (e.g., Chilton, Neilan, & Eldridge, 2018). Successional theory advances that earlier successional species condition a site to favour late-successional species (Bowker, 2007). However, we are unaware of any empirical evidence to show that succession occurs in biocrusts past the cyanobacterial stage. Potential mechanisms by which biocrust species might affect different species directly by facilitation or competition (Li et al., 2013; Maestre, Callaway, Valladares, & Lortie, 2009; Soliveres & Eldridge, 2020) or indirectly by altering site conditions or facilitating different species are poorly understood (Soliveres & Eldridge, 2020). Nonetheless, if, as stated by Kidron (2018), “the role of cyanobacteria as precursor of lichen-dominated crusts is undermined,” one cannot help but wonder where the photobionts in lichens originate from. In summary, the literature indicates that developmental and successional stages are synonymous in some contexts, but not in others, a view widely held within the biocrust research community. Paradigms 4–8 deal with what Kidron (2018) sees as the major drivers of hydrology (sens. lat.) or specific hydrological processes (infiltration and runoff). Given that the mechanisms behind these moderators exhibit several commonalities, we deal with these paradigms together. That climate drives hydrology via crust morphology (Paradigm 4) is only partially correct and certainly not a universal paradigm. Climate can affect freeze–thaw relationships, alter porosity and sorptivity, and sometimes influence runoff indirectly through controls on vascular plant–biocrust composition (Belnap, 2006). Climate (aridity) can also influence moss cover (Ferrenberg, Reed, & Belnap, 2015), which may alter retention time (Eldridge & Rosentreter, 2004). Rainfall intensity can also affect hydrology, by influencing the runoff coefficient (the proportion of rainfall that does not infiltrate) and therefore the partitioning of rainfall between runoff and infiltration. However, a critical examination of the literature reveals that climate is but one of many factors affecting hydrology (Belnap, 2006). Other equally important moderators of hydrology, include, but are not limited to, crust composition (Chamizo, Cantón, Lázaro, et al., 2012), which can influence surface roughness (Rodríguez-Caballero, Cantón, Chamizo, Afana, & Solé-Benet, 2012), hydrophobicity (Lichner et al., 2018), soil texture (Chamizo, Cantón, Miralles-Mellado, & Domingo, 2012), spatial scale (Cantón et al., 2011; Chamizo, Cantón, Rodríguez-Caballero, Domingo, & Escudero, 2012), and level of disturbance (Eldridge, 1998; Faist, Herrick, Belnap, Van Zee, & Barger, 2017). Thus, it is inconceivable that climate-driven morphology alone can be invoked as the major driver of hydrology. The assertion that “macro pores determine infiltration on biocrusted surfaces is however highly questionable” (Kidron, 2018) is inconsistent with the large body of evidence that these subsurface vesicular pores have a major impact on water infiltration by drastically reducing soil hydraulic conductivity (Dietze, Bartel, Lindner, & Kleber, 2012; Turk & Graham, 2011; Young, McDonald, Caldwell, Benner, & Meadows, 2004). But even if no vesicular pores exist within (or underneath) biocrusts, they still affect the properties of the pore network of their host soil (Coppola et al., 2011; Felde et al., 2014; Malam Issa, Défarge, Trichet, Valentin, & Rajot, 2009; Miralles-Mellado, Cantón, & Solé-Benet, 2011), which clearly has a strong impact on matter fluxes, including water movement. We acknowledge, however, that many other factors such as climate, topography, surface roughness, spatial scale, and soil texture drive infiltration and therefore runoff. Since porosity is only one of many factors affecting hydrological function, reductions in total pore volume might be compensated for by changes in other hydrological drivers such as surface roughness or water repellency or pore shape and connectivity (a statement that we already made in Felde et al., 2014). Overall, therefore, there is strong evidence to suggest that soil pores determine runoff (Paradigm 5). Paradigm 6 contends that runoff is a result of hydrophobicity (Kidron, 2018; Section 2.6). Biocrust hydrophobicity is highly temporally and spatially variable (Tighe, Haling, Flavel, Young, & Moya-Larano, 2012) and, contrary to claims by Kidron (2018), has been shown to depend on soil moisture content (Rodríguez-Caballero, Cantón, Chamizo, Lázaro, & Escudero, 2013; Yang et al., 2014) and to occur at sub-critical levels (low levels of hydrophobicity; Tillman, Scotter, Wallis, & Clothier, 1989) at the Nizzana Research Site (Keck, Felde, Drahorad, & Felix-Henningsen, 2016). This response of hydrophobicity (e.g., de Jonge, Jacobsen, & Moldrup, 1999; King, 1981) is thought to be related to the reorientation of amphiphilic molecules (Hallett, 2008). Like porosity and climate, hydrophobicity is but one of many factors influencing biocrust hydrology. The effects of EPS on soil hydrology (Paradigm 7) are complex and not completely understood. EPS in biocrusts are complex macromolecules comprising different monosaccharide fractions with different molecular weight distributions and consequently different capability to interact with soil particles and with water molecules (Rossi, Mugnai, & De Philippis, 2018). It is not unreasonable, therefore, that any effects of EPS on hydrology should vary across different studies (e.g., Rossi, Potrafka, Garcia-Pichel, & De Philippis, 2012; cf. Colica et al., 2014), particularly where those studies are from different soil types, with diverse crust types of varying morphologies, and markedly different EPS chemical and macromolecular characteristics. Any claim that EPS determine infiltration (Kidron, 2018) is only part of the truth, which is that the hydrological effects of biocrusts are strongly nuanced and vary widely with abiotic and biotic factors. Finally, Paradigm 8 contends that mosses impede infiltration and therefore perennial plant growth. There is almost no empirical evidence to support or invalidate this paradigm, so claims that this view is “common among hydrologists, ecologists, or microbiologists” are at best spurious. It is generally acknowledged, however, that mosses have variable effects on infiltration, either enhancing (Wu, Hasi, & Wugetemole,, & Wu, X., 2012) or suppressing (Xiao, Zhao, Wang, & Li, 2015) infiltration depending on ecological context and the nature of the moderators (soil texture, climate, level of disturbance, spatial scale, etc.) described above. Mosses can retain water due to the presence of specialized leaf architecture (leaf hair points, lamellae, and papillae) (Pan et al., 2016), which could reduce infiltration to deeper layers (Eldridge & Rosentreter, 2004), but this likely varies with moss species, seasonality, and soil type (Wu et al., 2012). Moss effects on the survival and growth of vascular plants are also variable and will depend on the balance of these contrasting effects. However, a global meta-analysis indicates that their overall effect on vascular plant performance is positive, but effects on germination are negative (Havrilla et al., 2019). There is little support for the contention therefore that mosses impede perennial plant growth. It is clear from the preceding discussion that the eight putative paradigms advanced by Kidron (2018) cannot be upheld nor are they commonly held among hydrologists, ecologists, or microbiologists that investigate biocrusts. However, we are thankful that Kidron (2018) has formally published his viewpoint because it gives us the opportunity to critically examine the veracity of such arguments, an important stage in the scientific process. Any proposal for paradigms that report global phenomena for such idiosyncratic communities of organisms as biocrusts would require an examination of the literature across the whole spectrum of biocrust distribution and environmental settings. Unfortunately, Kidron's (2018) “critique” is unashamedly heavily reliant on his own knowledge of desert systems, largely from one dune field in southern Israel. In attempting to globalize the effects of biocrusts on hydrology, Kidron (2018) risks simplifying nuanced and complex conditions providing junior researchers a narrow view of biocrust effects on hydrology, while ignoring the full spectrum of effects in different environmental and experimental contexts and scenarios. This generalization risks trivializing the science of biocrust hydrology and ignores decades of established research undertaken globally on biocrusts.

Anyone wishing to contribute articles or reviews to this section should contact him at the Department of Natural Sciences, University of St. Francis, 500 N. Wilcox, Joliet, IL 60435, (815) 740–3467, E-mail: wbromer@stfrancis.edu. Understanding basic concepts such as community structure, species diversity, and succession, as well as the possible causes of variation in species distribution and dispersion, is fundamental to undergraduate ecology courses. Given that determining species diversity or successional patterns requires knowledge of species abundances, it is important that students are also familiar with sampling theory, specifically how to draw an impartial sample of individuals from a community. Although outdoor exercises allow students to gain valuable experience in community ecology through sampling living communities, in large introductory courses, in winter-term courses, or in courses that survey a wide array of ecological topics, there are often too few laboratory periods to include outdoor exercises. We developed a web-based learning object, EcoSampler 〈 to provide Bucknell University majors in biology, animal behavior, and environmental studies with virtual experience sampling communities while facilitating their learning about community structure, species diversity, and succession. Here we offer an overview of EcoSampler and describe how we use this web-based simulation model in a sophomore-level Population and Community Biology (BIOL 208) course. Our students, paired on computers, use EcoSampler during one 3-hour laboratory session. Students interpret EcoSampler's output and prepare a written report, which is due at the following week's laboratory meeting. EcoSampler, which is freely available via the Web, also can be used in other ways, including as a homework assignment to supplement lecture materials or as an exercise that is part of an online course. Regardless of how EcoSampler is used, our experience suggests that it provides students with a strong conceptual and methodical background, and that it is very effective when coupled with a subsequent or concurrent field trip that involves community sampling. Instructions for EcoSampler are included online, so this article is intended to provide an overview of our learning object and to describe how we use it in our Bucknell University course. EcoSampler analyzes two digitized Pennsylvania old-growth forests using either area (quadrat) or distance (point-quarter) sampling methods with haphazard, random, or systematic sample-selection protocols. Because EcoSampler estimates the amount of field time necessary for each methodology, students discover that the efficiencies of sampling methods vary. In addition, they learn that sample bias differs among haphazard, random, and systematic sampling protocols, and that species differ in their spatial distributions. EcoSampler's summary of basal diameter size-class distributions facilitates predictions about the successional trends in the sampled communities, and its calculation of species richness and diversity enables comparison of the community structures of the two virtual forests. An obvious advantage of this learning object is that large numbers of students can simultaneously sample and analyze forest community data using several sampling criteria and methodologies, and they can gain appreciation of fundamental ecological concepts as they interpret their results. We use the 18 questions included with EcoSampler to guide our students' interpretation of results and frame their written reports. The objectives of EcoSampler include: (1) understanding sampling theory as applied to community ecology; (2) gaining understanding of area and distance-sampling methods and contrasting their advantages and disadvantages; (3) comparing sample bias with haphazard, random, and systematic sampling protocols; (4) learning about the measurement of species abundance (e.g., density, dominance, frequency), species dispersion, and community structure; (5) gaining understanding of ecological succession and species replacement; and (6) communicating results and conclusions via a written report. The Mohn Mill virtual forest is based on tree density, dominance, and frequency results from Abrahamson and Gohn's (2004) field study (Fig. 1). This species-rich virtual forest is particularly useful to explore sampling protocols as well as species dispersion and the effects of disturbance in bringing about successional change. Located in central Pennsylvania, the 154-ha Mohn Mill site (41°4′ N, 77°8′ W) includes bottomlands as well as gentle to steep slopes. Elevations range from 420 to 570 m above mean sea level. The area's sandstone-derived soils include loams, sandy loams, and stony to very stony loams. The Mohn Mill area was logged between 1904 and 1912 during the period identified as the “clear-cut or hemlock-chemical wood” era but the area has not experienced timber extraction since. Chestnut blight eliminated the American chestnut from the site's canopy during the 1930s, which likely facilitated additional dominance by oaks. The site experienced gypsy moth outbreaks from 1979 to 1982 and during 1996, and severe windstorms as well as ice and wet snow events have impacted the forest's canopy. Currently, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus browsing is inhibiting oak regeneration, and acid precipitation may be influencing the acidic soils and plant performance (Abrahamson and Gohn 2004). Selection of the virtual forest to sample involves an interface that also facilitates control of the appearance of the simulation model. The Mohn Mill area is a Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources proposed wild-plant sanctuary in part because of the presence of the federally endangered northeastern bulrush (Scirpus ancistrochaetus Schuyler). The small, seasonal ponds that harbor northeastern bulrush occur within an oak-canopied forest matrix that is likely crucial to the long-term survival of this plant. Although the Mohn Mill site is protected from logging, Abrahamson and Gohn (2004) showed that the site is experiencing a replacement of white, chestnut, red, and black oaks by more shade-tolerant red maple and eastern hemlock. As the overstory oaks age and die, oaks are replaced disproportionately by red maple and eastern hemlock depending on microsite conditions. This transition will have major implications for understory plants, including the persistence of the northeastern bulrush, because of reduced available light. EcoSampler's tree size-class histograms help students understand such species replacements and the consequences of succession. The Snyder-Middleswarth virtual forest is based on tree density, dominance, and frequency results from a field study by Zawadzkas and Abrahamson (2003: Fig. 1). This virtual forest has limited tree-species diversity, which offers a useful contrast to the Mohn Mill forest. Because it has marked topographic variety, this forest is useful to explore the patterns of species occurrence and dispersion in relation to spatial variation and edaphic conditions. The Snyder-Middleswarth Natural Area (40°48′ N, 77°19′ W) in central Pennsylvania is among the largest of the few old-growth eastern hemlock–yellow birch forests remaining in Pennsylvania. Thanks originally to inaccessibility and in 1965 to its designation as a National Natural Landmark, a 135-ha portion of this forest has never been logged. The Snyder-Middleswarth forest is located in a narrow and steep ravine between two east- and westrunning ridges, and as a consequence the ravine has well-developed north-facing and south-facing slopes as well as a bottomland and ridge-top community. Slopes vary in steepness up to 68% with elevations ranging from 450 to 550 m. The soils are extremely stony and sandy well-drained loams that have weathered from Tuscarora sandstone. These soils have low to moderate available water capacity and have virtually no pH buffering capacity. As a consequence, acid precipitation is further acidifying the already acidic soils, which is likely impacting on plant performance. While there are recurrent natural disturbances within this forest including windstorms, especially those associated with snow or ice events, disturbance from acid precipitation and hemlock woolly adelgid are the most serious threats (Zawadzkas and Abrahamson 2003). The latter threatens the continued domination of the old-growth forest by eastern hemlock. Gypsy moth outbreaks since the mid-1970s have impacted the oak canopies of the south-facing slope and ridge tops during multiple growing seasons, and browsing by white-tailed deer is limiting tree regeneration. Sampling the Snyder-Middleswarth virtual forest facilitates student examination of species dispersion and distribution and the consequences of disturbances to succession. The reliabilities of haphazard, random, and systematic sampling protocols. Students learn that haphazard sampling introduces bias and that systematic or random protocols avoid bias much better. The efficiencies of area and distance sampling protocols. Students discover that one protocol may be a better choice than the other depending on the community. Succession and the spatial-occurrence patterns of forest trees. Students examine the successional status of individual forest species and use life-history attributes of species to consider why a given species has its specific distributions within a forest mosaic. Community structure. Students recognize that diversity indices are dependent on both species richness and species evenness and that both measures are important to understanding community structure. Patterns of species occurrence and abundance due to spatial variation in topography and/or edaphic conditions. Students discover that north-facing and south-facing slopes as well as ridge tops and bottomlands have different species composition and abundance. They also realize that forest trees are differentially adapted to environmental conditions. Assignment 1: Haphazard, Random, and Systematic Sampling Protocols.—This assignment investigates sampling bias among haphazard, random, and systematic sampling protocols with the Mohn Mill mixed oak–red maple virtual forest. Students are presented an aerial “community view” of the Mohn Mill forest and sample to determine the abundances of the tree species within the community (Fig. 2). Without prior discussion of sampling bias, samples are almost inevitably drawn disproportionately from the center portion of the community. Because of the nonuniform distributions of species, such repeated sampling of a limited portion of the virtual forest generates a biased sample in which some species are oversampled while others are undersampled. Next we have our students draw their samples using random and then systematic sampling protocols. Students compare species-abundance estimates obtained with each protocol to the community's actual abundance measures, which enables them to gain an understanding of strengths and weaknesses of each protocol (Fig. 3). Community and Quadrat views of the Mohn Mill virtual forest. Colored symbols indicate the identity, size, and location of individual trees. The virtual forest can be sampled with or without an overlaid grid of quadrats or points that can be sampled haphazardly, randomly, or systematically. Community view showing sampled quadrats (quadrats with Xs), topographical view option, and point-quarter sampling view along with example output for the Snyder-Middleswarth Natural Area. During each assignment, students must determine when the virtual community is adequately sampled by examining a graph of the cumulative number of species sampled vs. the number or area of samples taken. Species–area graphs generated by our model provide students with a semi-objective means to determine the area or number of plots to sample (Fig. 2). Each assignment is accompanied by a set of questions designed to guide the students' interpretation of results and evaluate their understanding. In assignment 1 these questions examine the reliabilities of haphazard, random, and systematic sampling by comparing the estimated values based on sampling to actual values. Students conclude that haphazard sampling can introduce bias. Students are then asked to reflect on the efficiencies of random versus systematic sampling in the field using the estimates of time commitment for each sampling (Fig. 3). Students recognize the tradeoff of collecting many samples to gain accuracy in measures of rarer species versus the time and cost of obtaining numerous samples. Students then compare the accuracy of their estimated abundance measures for common versus rare species against actual values. They discover that estimates for rare species are less reliable than those for common species. A final component of assignment 1 asks students to describe the population structure for the most common species by examining its density, dominance, frequency, and importance. Using histograms of tree sizes (Fig. 3), they can determine whether a given species is invading or dropping out of the sampled community or whether its population is stable. Information about the species' natural history, available within EcoSampler, helps connect the virtual forest trees with tree life-history traits (Fig. 2). Assignment 2: Area vs. Distance Sampling Protocols.—The second assignment uses point-quarter sampling of the Mohn Mill virtual forest and compares the results to those from assignment 1, which employs area sampling. Students learn that the point-quarter method is well suited for sampling widely spaced individuals or large individuals (e.g., trees). Assignment 2 questions focus on (1) when area vs. distance sampling would be preferred; (2) whether equal numbers of quadrats and points provide the same reliability for abundance measures; (3) species richness and its meaning; and (4) the meaning of importance values and how two species could have identical importance values yet quite different abundance measures. Assignment 3: Dispersion and Succession.—Species dispersion, using the Morisita Index of Dispersion (Morisita 1959, Brower et al. 1998), and secondary succession are explored using the Mohn Mill virtual forest. Questions direct students to interpret the dispersion indices of species, most of which are aggregated. Using the life-history information that is available for each species (Fig. 2), students make connections between life-history traits and patterns of dispersion (e.g., clonal propagation of trees and their consequent clumped distribution). The second component of this assignment has students explore the relationship of the Morisita Index and frequency. They find that the two measures are inversely related, and furthermore that frequency, when considered along with density, offers insight into spatial occurrence. Students soon appreciate that frequency, density, and dominance each express different key aspects of population structure. A third component of assignment 3 investigates succession via an examination of species recruitment with size-class distributions of tree basal areas (Fig. 3). Although tree sizes do not precisely represent tree ages, tree-size data do provide considerable insight into a species' successional status (Skowno et al. 1999). Our questions ask students to predict the future success of dominant trees in the Mohn Mill virtual forest via a comparison of the size-class histograms generated from samples with expected sizeclass distributions for hypothetical species with stable, successfully invading, unsuccessful or episodic invasion, and senile size-class structures (Fig. 4). A fourth component of assignment 3 is for students to recognize that the size-class distributions at Mohn Mill show little recruitment of oaks but substantial recruitment of red maple, suggesting that the forest is undergoing successional change as oaks are replaced by red maples. Expected size-class distributions for trees showing stable, successfully invading, unsuccessful or episodic invasion, and senile, dropping-out populations. Assignment 4: Community Structure.—While dispersion is a characteristic of populations, measures of species richness and species diversity are characteristics of communities that help assess community structure. To calculate species diversity in the virtual forests, EcoSampler uses the popular Shannon-Wiener Index. In this assignment, students sample the Snyder-Middleswarth eastern hemlock–yellow birch virtual forest and compare the species richness and diversity of this forest to these values for the Mohn Mill virtual forest sampled in the previous assignments. They find that Snyder-Middleswarth virtual forest has less species richness and diversity. Students also compare the size-class distributions for sampled eastern hemlock and yellow birch to theoretical expectations (Fig. 4) and find that both species have stable size-class distributions. Thus, they predict that both species are likely to continue dominance at the site unless disturbances such as hemlock woolly adelgids and/or acid precipitation alter the conditions that favor these species. However, when the size-class distributions of sweet (black) birch are examined, students discover a distribution that suggests an unsuccessful or episodic invasion (Fig. 4) based on limited current recruitment. When available life-history information is considered, students conclude that sweet birch has this size-class distribution because it experiences episodic recruitment due to its dependence on disturbance-generated canopy gaps that enable light levels that support its colonization and establishment. Assignment 5: Topographic and Edaphic Influences on Plant Distribution.—This assignment examines the variation in species distributions due to topographic and edaphic factors by comparing the northfacing and south-facing slopes as well as the bottomland and ridge top in the Snyder-Middleswarth virtual forest. At the latitude of central Pennsylvania, a 20° south-facing slope receives an average of 40% more midday insolation than a 20° north-facing slope. This difference has a striking effect on the heat budgets and available soil moistures of the two slopes; south-facing slopes are warmer, their evaporation rate is typically 50% higher, and their available soil moisture is lower (Smith and Smith 2001). Systematic sampling is used to locate quadrats within four of the five labeled subsets of the virtual forest: southern and northern ridge tops, north-facing and south-facing slopes, and bottomland. Students first compare the bottomland, which is dominated by eastern hemlock and yellow birch, to a ridge top, which is covered by red and striped maple, chestnut oak, and sweet birch. The more xeric and higher wind-damaged ridge-top conditions are more suitable for shorter-lived and colonizing species. Next students compare the more xeric south-facing with the more mesic north-facing slope. They find that the south-facing slope has more chestnut oak and red maple, while the north-facing slope has more eastern hemlock, white pine, and sweet birch. Finally, students describe the population structure of chestnut oak on the south-facing slope. The learning outcome of EcoSampler exercises can be assessed in a variety of ways. One option is to conduct a pre-lab assessment in order to help prepare students to use EcoSampler. Students read the available online introduction, background, and assignments sections before coming to lab. We begin our lab with 30–35 minutes of introduction of relevant concepts (e.g., community structure, succession) because our EcoSampler lab exercise comes prior to discussions of community ecology in lecture. (Community ecology is covered in our spring course lectures in the latter portion of the semester when our labs involve field exercises.) We have found that our students need to understand the following points before beginning the EcoSampler exercise: (1) a community is an assemblage of interacting populations of species that occupy a given area; (2) a community is characterized by both a physical and biological structure; (3) the mix of species that make up a community defines its biological structure; (4) population interactions such as competition, predation, parasitism, and mutualism influence community organization; (5) the biological structure of a community can be defined, in part, by the density, frequency, and dominance of each of the species that compose the community; (6) spatial variation is part of community structure; and (7) succession of species occurs in communities over time. In order for the exercise to be most effective, students must understand why it is necessary for ecologists to know what species compose a community, how abundant those species are, and if some species are increasing in abundance while others are decreasing over time. At the conclusion of the introduction to the EcoSampler exercise, students could be asked to write a two- or three-minute paper on any misconceptions that they held about key points prior to the lab presentation (Sacchi 2006). Even with a moderately detailed introductory presentation, we have found that our students comfortably complete all five assignments within a three-hour lab period. Instructors who adopt EcoSampler can select specific assignments or use all five assignments depending on their audience and time available. Alternatively, instructors can develop their own assignments using EcoSampler's virtual forests and sampling capabilities. We evaluate our students via written reports (submitted electronically) that are due at the following week's laboratory. Reports are graded using a key and guidelines to standardize evaluation. We would be happy to make this key available to adopting instructors, upon request. We encourage our students to consider concepts and issues that lie beyond the scope of the assigned exercises. Discussions in lecture or subsequent labs provide an excellent way to engage students. For example, students can be asked to ponder the value of having measures of species abundances within a community that are taken at different times along a timeline (i.e., having a baseline against which future measures of species abundances within that community can be compared). They should consider the types of questions that can be answered with such timelines to understand species change and succession, impacts of land-management plans, development of conservation plans for natural areas, or recovery plans for threatened or endangered species. Alternatively, a discussion of the reasons why plants show clumped distributions can challenge students to consider life-history traits. Such discussions help students understand that environmental gradients are the rule in nature, so that a site that is good for one individual of a given species is likely to be good for other individuals of that species. Students might also realize that there are forces in nature that counteract clumping. Competition among individuals for water in deserts or light in forests can favor regular spacing, as can damage done by plant antagonists such as herbivores or pathogens that more easily find clumped host plants (Barbour et al. 1999). We have found that conversations about community structure and species diversity can probe the degree of student understanding of the complexity of trophic interactions within communities of differing species diversity. For example, communities with high species diversity may have more complex and varied interactions (e.g., energy transfer, predation, competition) among species than communities of low diversity. A final example is especially pertinent for “pre-med” majors: it involves a discussion of the importance of statistically valid sampling methods in determining the efficacy of new medicines and the responses of cells to various treatments. EcoSampler is hosted on a web server at Bucknell University. The client side runs well on either a Windows-platform PC running Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox or a Macintosh computer running Safari or Internet Explorer. Cookies and JavaScript must be enabled. The preferred screen resolution is 1280 × 1024, but should be at least 1024 × 768 in order to view pages. DSL/Cable Modem or higher is the preferred connection because EcoSampler is graphically rich. The simulation model is implemented using Active Server Pages (ASP)/VBScript via Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0. Community data are stored in a Microsoft Access database, and EcoSampler's code makes extensive uses of IIS session variables for storing data as the community is sampled. Output is standard HTML, with tables used to format various views of the community. The HTML includes a limited use of JavaScript, primarily to prevent problems from using the Back button. In addition to the basic functionality, EcoSampler includes several “administrative” scripts for generating community data. Introductory ecology courses include discussions of community structure, species diversity, and succession. Appreciation of sampling theory is essential to student understanding of these and other ecological concepts. Using data from two Pennsylvania forests, an old-growth eastern hemlock/yellow birch community and a mixed oak/red maple community uncut since the early 1900s, web-based EcoSampler's virtual forests facilitate student investigation of sampling theory, community structure, and succession. The model employs area (quadrat) or distance (point-quarter) methods, with haphazard, random, or systematic sampling protocols. Students learn how to recognize when they have adequately sampled a community and a “time/effort” function permits students to assess the labor trade-offs of sampling protocols. Output from EcoSampler includes absolute and relative measures of species density, frequency, dominance, and importance, size-class distributions, and dispersion, as well as species diversity and natural history information about each species. EcoSampler's five assignments examine (1) potential for bias in haphazard, random, and systematic sampling protocols; (2) area vs. distance sampling procedures; (3) species dispersion and successional trends based on analysis of size-class distributions; (4) community structure via species diversity; and (5) variation in species distribution due to topographic and edaphic factors. EcoSampler is freely available using high-speed, internet-connected Windows or Macintosh computers as we described above, as homework assignments, or projects for an online course. We thank Steve Jordan, Matt McTammany, Catherine Blair, and Harold Ornes for their insightful comments and suggestions. We appreciate the help of students enrolled in Bucknell University's BIOL 208 Population and Community Biology course who rigorously tested early versions of EcoSampler and who continue to help us improve our learning object.

https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294x.2006.3253_1.x,Editorial and Retrospective 2007,"This has been another banner year for Molecular Ecology. Among the 112 journals listed in ISI's Ecology category in 2005, Molecular Ecology is second in number of articles published (356), eighth in total citations (11 339), and tenth in impact factor (4.30). The journal is increasingly widely read, with articles downloaded 484 500 times during 2005, a rise of 14% over 2004. Also, despite increased competition from other journals, the number and quality of manuscripts submitted to Molecular Ecology continues to grow. Indeed, when this editorial was written, we were on track to receive approximately 1200 submissions, which represents almost a 10% increase over last year (see Figure 1). The number of pages published in the journal expanded by a similar percentage, from 4 488 pages in 2005 to 4653 in 2006. To accommodate the additional pages, yet keep individual issues to a manageable size, we plan to increase the number of issues published in 2007 from 14 to 24. Numbers of manuscripts received per year since 1995. The continued increase in submissions represents a challenge to our subject editors, journal secretaries, production editors, and referees. Thus, we are grateful for their efficiency and careful diligence, which have kept our publication times among the lowest in ecology and evolution. The mean time from manuscript receipt to an editorial decision is just 53 days. Our production staff moves accepted manuscripts to On-line Early publication in 42 days (on average), with the print version appearing approximately 24 days later. Journal Secretaries, Siân Lynch, Elinor Smith, and Simmoné Fellowes, and Production Editor, Ann Cowie, are most responsible for keeping our rapid publication times at Molecular Ecology. We thank them for their contributions, particularly Siân Lynch, who after eight years with the journal has completed her Open University BSc in Maths and is now in full-time teaching. She will be missed by all of us. Simmoné Fellowes replaced Siân in late summer, and we are pleased to welcome her. Although we are generally pleased with both the quality and quantity of submissions to Molecular Ecology, we continue to tweak our editorial policy to make the journal more attractive to our readers and to serve the molecular ecology community more effectively. We have made several such changes in 2006. First, we have moved technical reviews and articles to Molecular Ecology Notes, along with papers on molecular diagnostics, DNA taxonomy, and barcoding. Second, we plan to change the name of Molecular Ecology Notes to Molecular Ecology Tools effective January 2008. The rationale for these changes are to (1) give our more tool-oriented papers a single home; (2) recognize that we will be publishing full length papers and reviews, rather than exclusively notes; and (3) acknowledge the tremendous promise molecular diagnostics, DNA taxonomy, and barcoding hold for ecological studies. To facilitate these changes, we are pleased to announce that Jeannette Whitton (University of British Columbia), Brian Golding (McMaster University) and Jared Strasburg (Indiana University) have joined the editorial board of Molecular Ecology Notes and will be responsible for DNA taxonomy papers, barcoding studies, and technical reviews/articles, respectively. A third recent change is the addition of a News and Views editor, Nolan Kane (University of British Columbia), who will be responsible for commentaries, news, interviews, photographs, etc. Our hope is to increase the visibility of the science published in this journal, as well as to recognize the scientists who are responsible for new and exciting discoveries in molecular ecology. The recruitment of a News and Views editor represents a first step toward our longer-term goal of providing one-stop access to news and science in the area of molecular ecology. If you wish to write a commentary on a paper you have reviewed, or to describe a recent meeting you have attended, please contact Nolan (nkane@indiana.edu). The 2006 Molecular Ecology Prize was awarded to evolutionary geneticist, Dr. John Avise, who pioneered the use of molecular markers to estimate evolutionary relationships among natural populations of animals. He is the founding father of phylogeography, the study of the geographic distribution of genetic lineages within species. He also is the patron saint of Molecular Ecology. Indeed, his 1994 book titled, Molecular Markers, Natural History, and Evolution, has come to define the content and boundaries of the field. Dr. Avise currently is a distinguished Professor at the University of California, Irvine and the recipient of numerous awards and honors. These include election to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He also has served as president of the Society for the Study of Evolution, the Society of Molecular Biology and Evolution, and the American Genetics Association. A biography of Dr. Avise and his contributions to molecular ecology can be found on page? of this issue. We continue to commission special issues and reviews on topics that are of interest to our readers or that represent important future research directions that we would like to see included in Molecular Ecology. In April 2006 we published a special issue on Ecological and Evolutionary Genomics of Populations in Nature to illustrate the power of genomic approaches for identifying and studying ecologically important genes in wild populations. In 2007, we will publish special issues on the The Ecological Genetics of Speciation and on Microevolutionary Change in Human-Altered Environments. The latter topic is particularly timely because rapid climate changes due to global warming may exceed the rate at which many populations can respond evolutionarily without going extinct. We also published one or more reviews in most issues of the journal. Topics ranged from ‘Ecological and evolutionary genomics of Saccharomyces cerevisiae’ (Landry et al. 2006) to ‘Studying phenotypic evolution using multivariate quantitative genetics’ (McGuigan 2006) to ‘What is a population? An empirical evaluation of some genetic methods for identifying the number of gene pools and their degree of connectivity’ (Waples & Gaggiotti 2006) to ‘Phytochrome-mediated development in land plants: red light sensing evolves to meet the challenges of changing light environments’ (Mathews 2006). We are open to suggestions from our readers regarding subjects that are overdue for review or synthesis. Those who have reviewed papers during 2006 are listed in Table 1. We continue to be grateful for your service to both the journal and discipline of molecular ecology. In keeping with our goal of providing greater visibility to the science published in Molecular Ecology, we have expanded our editorial to include a retrospective on major discoveries in molecular ecology in the previous year. The Fast Track category was created to attract manuscripts of exceptional interest to a wide audience, similar to that required for the major weekly journals. In 2006, several high-profile discoveries were published in this category. These include the discovery of heritable and often parallel changes in gene expression in farmed salmon (Roberge et al. 2006). This discovery is worrisome because gene flow between farmed escapees and wild populations likely will reduce the fitness of the latter. Another finding with important implications for conservation biology is that gene migration rates for bobcats and coyotes across the Ventura Freeway in Southern California are less than one tenth that expected from radio-telemetry data (Riley et al. 2006). Apparently, territory pile-up at freeway boundaries decreases reproductive success of migrants. This result was featured in the April 13 issue of Nature (Strasburg 2006). A third Fast Track paper tackled the controversial topic of species delimitation. The standard approach is to identify species boundaries using morphological data. Conclusions from these studies are then validated by molecular marker data or bar codes. Duminil et al. (2006) make the provocative argument that the field would be better served by a blind approach, in which species are solely delimited with molecular markers without reference to morphology. Arguably the most remarkable study published in 2006 was an analysis of the phylogeography of parthenogenesis in grasshoppers and lizards in Australia (Kearney et al. 2006). In both species, parthenogenesis arose twice and expanded in parallel waves across Australia, implying that selection against sex in these two systems might be due to similar biogeographic forces. Molecular Ecology has been home to many significant discoveries in 2006. We do not have space to describe all of them here. Instead, we highlight a handful of noteworthy findings and interesting discussions: Controlling Invasions. Invasive species often lack the complex of natural enemies that regulate their distribution in native habitat. These natural enemies are sometimes deliberately introduced from native areas to control the worst invaders. Goolsby et al. (2006) employ molecular phylogeographic data to show that biocontrol of an exotic weed fern is most effective if the control agent comes from same geographic locality as the invader. Thus, phylogeographic study of both the invader and its biocontrol agent may contribute to more effective management of invasive species. Cryptic Species. Diversity in most organismal groups is quantified as the number of morphological or ‘taxonomic’ species (Grundt et al. 2006). However, molecular phylogeographic data provide the opportunity to detect cryptic biological species, thus expanding (or in some cases contracting) estimates of biological diversity. Examples include the detection of cryptic species of poisonous fly agaric mushrooms (Geml et al. 2006), plethodontid salamanders (Kozak et al. 2006), the basidiomycete Serpula himantioides (Kauserud et al. 2006), Lake Malawi cichlids (Kidd et al. 2006), a subterranean amphipod Niphargus virei (Lefebure et al. 2006), the Utah Sucker (Mock et al.2006), mysid crustaceans (Audzijonyte et al. 2006), amphipod crustaceans (Witt et al. 2006), and brittle star (Muths et al. 2006). Thus, in many groups the number of named species appears to represent an underestimate of biological species diversity, although see Rieseberg et al. (2006). Dutch Elm Disease. The Dutch elm disease fungus was accidentally introduced from Asia to Europe and North America, where it has killed billions of native elm trees over the past century. In a remarkable piece of detective work, Paoletti et al. (2006) show that the invasive spread of the fungus was facilitated by interspecies transfer of mating and vegetative incompatibility type alleles. This study adds to a growing literature on the apparent importance of hybridization as a stimulus for the evolution of invasiveness (Ellstrand & Schierenbeck 2000), although see Nolte et al. (2006). Ectomycorrhizal Fungi Compensate for Inefficient Photosynthesis. Orchids that lack photosynthetic pigments are known to obtain their nutrients from ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, Girlanda et al. (2006) show that photosynthesis is so limited in a pigmented Mediterranean orchid, Limodorum, that both photosynthesis and nutrients from fungal symbionts are required for growth. Perhaps Limodorum represents a transitional form between photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic orchids. Extra-Pair Paternity. A variety of hypotheses have been put forward to explain the high frequency of extra-pair paternity. Females may gain by (1) obtaining good genes for offspring, (2) obtaining compatible genes for offspring, (3) increasing the genetic diversity of offspring, or (4) testing future partners (Bouwman et al. 2006). A study of yellowthroats was most consistent with the good genes hypothesis since extra-pair offspring had stronger immune responses (Garvin et al. 2006), the compatible genes hypothesis was most strongly supported by data from reed buntings (Bouwman et al. 2006), and data from tree swallows supported the genetic diversity hypothesis (Whittingham et al. 2006). Thus, like many problems in ecology and evolutionary, extra-pair paternity appears to require a pluralistic explanation. Extreme Site Fidelity. The fidelity of many animals to nesting or breeding sites can be remarkable and may influence mate choice, metapopulation dynamics, parasite levels, and population genetic structure. A recent study in Molecular Ecology documents a level of site faithfulness and specificity that, to our knowledge, is unprecedented. Using an aerial walkway and genetic recapture data, Hoffmann et al. (2006b) show that breeding males often return to within a body length of where they were the year before! Functional Molecular Ecology. The development of microarrays for both model and non-model organisms has made it feasible to scan genomes for genes that respond to changes in the environment or that represent candidate targets of selection (Lee & Mitchell-Olds 2006). Although a handful of microarrays studies have been published in Molecular Ecology in the past, 2006 was the first year in which they became a major component of the journal. Microarrays were used to screen for rapidly evolving genes in an ectomycorrhizal fungus (Le Quere et al. 2006), assess the of origins of expression variation in natural populations (Whitehead & Crawford 2006), determine the consequences of homoploid hybrid speciation (Lai et al. 2006), identify candidate genes for local adaptation (Filatov et al. 2006; Juenger et al. 2006; Knight et al. 2006), study parallel genotypic evolution (Derome et al. 2006), and investigate coevolutionary responses between endosymbionts, parasites, and their hosts (Moran & Degnan 2006; Ralph et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2006). These studies highlight the potential for this approach and the kinds of studies we hope to see published more frequently in Molecular Ecology. Gene Flow: Geography versus Selection. Gene flow may be restricted by geographic barriers and/or by divergent natural selection, but the relative importance of these barriers is poorly understood. Crispo et al. (2006) showed that in guppies, neutral gene flow is limited by physical barriers and geographic distance, but not by different predator environments, despite the fact that the latter are known to impose strong divergent selection in this system. Numerous other examples of isolation by physical barriers or distance were reported during the past year, including: bivalves (Kenchington et al. 2006; Zardus et al. 2006), Atlantic salmon (Primmer et al. 2006), Eurasian badger (Marmi et al. 2006; Pope et al. 2006), Japanese wild soybean (Kuroda et al. 2006), Arabidopsis thaliana (Bakker et al. 2006; Ostrowski et al. 2006), A. lyrata (Clauss & Mitchell-Olds 2006), cichlid fish (Duftner et al. 2006), alpine newt (Pabijan & Babik 2006), chestnut-backed chickadees (Burg et al. 2006), Hawaiian shrimp (Santos 2006), Chihuahua spruce (Jaramillo-Correa et al. 2006), Steller's sea lion (Hoffman et al. 2006a), Mediterranean triplefin fish (Carreras-Carbonell et al. 2006), black fly (Finn et al. 2006), Silene species (Moyle 2006), killifish (Adams et al. 2006), horseshoe bat (Chen et al. 2006), flat-tailed horned lizard (Mulcahy et al. 2006), Philippine fruit bats (Roberts 2006), newts (Martinez-Solano et al. 2006), blacktip shark (Keeney & Heist 2006), Japanese cinquefoil (Ikeda et al. 2006), and coral reef fishes (Taylor & Hellberg 2006), although see Leblois et al. (2006). In only a handful of cases was isolation seemingly due to divergent natural selection. Genetic differentiation was correlated with habitat rather than geographic distance in a lichen-forming ascomycete (Lindblom & Ekman 2006), with time in the European eel (Maes et al. 2006) and European ash species (Gerard et al. 2006), and with call-type in New World crossbills (Parchman et al. 2006). Also, a weak effect of habitat was observed among populations of the European three-spined stickleback (Makinen et al. 2006), and Stevens et al. (2006) report that habitat preferences explain dispersal rates better than geographic distance in the endangered natterjack toad. Finally, sister cichlid species in Lake Malawi separated by only 1–2 m of depth are divergent in both ecologically and sexually selected traits (Kidd et al. 2006). Hybridization and Conservation. Hybridization between common and rare populations may have a detrimental effect on the latter (Wolf et al. 2001). If hybrids are sterile or inviable, then rare populations may have reduced fitness because gametes are wasted in the formation of unfit hybrid individuals. On the other hand, if hybrids are fertile and vigorous, hybridization can lead to the genetic assimilation of the rare taxon by a numerically larger one. Examples reported this year in Molecular Ecology, include the wildcat population in Hungary, which is threatened by hybridization with domesticated cats (Lecis et al. 2006) and the merger of three-spined stickleback species (Taylor & Hellberg 2006) and black rattlesnake phylogroups (Gibbs et al. 2006). Hybridization also appears to be frequent between manatee species at the mouth of the Amazon River in Brazil (Vianna et al. 2006), American and European eels (Albert et al. 2006), as well as among three species of fur seal following re-colonization of Macquarie Island (Lancaster et al. 2006). In the latter case, hybridization frequency has been dropping over time, suggestive of ‘biological resistance to complete homogenization’. In contrast, hybridization and introgression were shown to be limited between dogs and Italian wolves (Verardi et al. 2006) and between subspecies of waterbuck (Lorenzen et al. 2006). Also, in another stickleback species pair, hybridization rates are low and appear to be contributing to reinforcement (Gow et al. 2006). Interest in the biological consequence of hybridization has been accompanied by theoretical treatments that provide guidelines regarding the number of loci required for accurate identification of hybrids (Vaha & Primmer 2006) or that suggest more computationally efficient methods for detection of admixture (Corander & Marttinen 2006). Hybrid Speciation. The origin of new diploid species through hybridization is considered to be rare, particularly in animals. Indeed, the two most convincing examples of animal hybrid speciation appeared very recently in Nature (Mavarez et al. 2006; Schwarz et al. 2005). Thus, we were fortunate to publish a third excellent example of animal hybrid speciation, in this case the origin of a new swordtail species (Meyer et al. 2006). What makes this example unique is that reproductive isolation of the hybrids appears to be a consequence of sexual selection through female choice. Inbreeding Depression. Molecular marker data now make it possible to evaluate the effects of inbreeding depression in natural populations of animals and plants. In a high profile study of Mandrills based on five generations of pedigree data, inbreeding depression was observed in females, but not males (Charpentier et al. 2006). Inbred females were smaller and gave birth earlier than non-inbred females, perhaps because they were less able to avoid ‘male sexual coercion’. In contrast, stronger inbreeding effects were observed in males than females in walleye populations from Ontario (Cena et al. 2006). Inbreeding depression was also reported in a rare and declining bumblebee (Darvill et al. 2006), but not in the endangered copper redhorse (Lippe et al. 2006). Interestingly, Simmons et al. (2006) show that female gryllad crickets mated with related and unrelated males were able to avoid fertilization by the former. Multiple Paternity. Why does the frequency of multiple paternities vary among populations? In olive ridley sea turtles, opportunity appears to be the key factor. Multiple paternity increases with numbers of individuals in the breeding population (Jensen et al. 2006). Size does Matter, at least in the small, semelparous marsupial, Antechinus stuartii. Holleley et al. (2006) tested two hypotheses for the evolution of semelparity in this species: intermale competition for mates, and sperm competition. The former will lead to increased body size, whereas the latter should cause an increase in scrotal size, a surrogate for testes volume. Paternity analyses revealed that the siring success of males was enhanced by an increase in both body and scrotal size. Thus, at least in this species, it is best to be large and to produce copious volumes of sperm. Sympatric Speciation. An important question in speciation studies is whether new species often arise in the absence of geographic barriers to gene flow (i.e., sympatric speciation). Theoretical studies indicate that while sympatric speciation is possible, the necessary evolutionary conditions are more stringent than for speciation in allopatry. Empirical studies offer another means for evaluating the importance of sympatric speciation, but it can be extremely difficult to prove. In particular, it is difficult to rule out the possibility of an allopatric phase during the evolutionary history of most sympatric congeners. Nonetheless, a number of studies tackled this problem with some success in 2006. For example, Jordal et al. (2006) showed that two bark beetle taxa found on the same host plant on La Palma Island in the Canaries likely had an allopatric phase of divergence, although speciation was completed in sympatry. Likewise, Diegisser et al. (2006) present evidence for a peripatric phase during the divergence of tephritid flies on European thistles. Transgene Escape. Molecular Ecology also reported the first example of the escape of a transgenic perennial weed (Reichman et al. 2006). Featured in both Current Biology and Nature, this study detected RoundUp Ready creeping bentgrass on public lands up to 3.8 km from a controlled site where seed production is underway. Thus, at least in bentgrass, the ‘transgenie’ is out of the bottle.",W2915636215,True,0.9002002477645874

To guide effective conservation policies, it is essential to understand the relationship between species diversity and carbon storage in this unique ecosystem. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the response of aboveground carbon (AGC) to species and functional diversity and their effects on AGC in the Yayu Coffee Forest Biosphere Reserve (YCFBR). Using different plot sizes, we collected vegetation data from the core, buffer, and transitional zones of the reserve. We selected traits related to plant‐life strategy, competition ability, response to disturbances, and climate change. Structural equation models (SEMs) were employed to assess the effects of species diversity, functional diversity, and functional dominance on AGC. Data analysis was conducted using R software. Our results revealed that the effects of species richness on AGC were mediated through functional diversity and functional dominance, as demonstrated by both the full mediation and partial mediation models. This suggests that the selection effects and niche complementarity are mutually exclusive yet equally important for predicting AGC. The findings further indicate that functional diversity and functional dominance together accounted for significant predictors of the AGC by 21% in the YCFBR. From a practical standpoint, findings highlight the importance of conserving species diversity as a means to maintain higher AGC in the tropical moist Afromontane forests. In conclusion, this research significantly contributes to the scientific literature by providing valuable insights into the complex relationship between species diversity and carbon storage. The results emphasize the crucial role of functional diversity and dominance in predicting AGC, underscoring the importance of biodiversity conservation for climate mitigation efforts. These findings have practical implications for the development of effective conservation policies tailored to protect and sustain the carbon storage potential of this unique ecosystem.",W4401666813,True,0.9937657713890076
https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.20402,When lettuce bolts: natural selection vs artificial selection and beyond,"'Qi et al.'s research exemplifies the power of leveraging natural genetic diversity to address key agricultural challenges.' The vegetative–flowering transition is regulated by a complex network of genetic and environmental factors. Over the past decade, many genes have been implicated in the control of flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana (Bouché et al., 2016). Investigating homologous genes and their regulatory mechanisms has provided insights into the molecular mechanism of bolting in lettuce (Fukuda et al., 2011, 2017). However, lettuce has a more complex genome and unique features in terms of vegetable crop traits compared with Arabidopsis. Modern lettuce variants exhibit tremendous morphological variation, especially regarding the rate of transition to flowering (Ryder, 1988; Zhang et al., 2017). Genetic variation in lettuce not only serves as a crucial resource for breeding and improvement but also offers opportunities to identify key genes for bolting. In this study, Qi et al. generated a segregating population by crossing a crisphead-type cultivar with a stem-type cultivar to map the LsKN1 allele. They demonstrate that the activated allele, LsKN1TP, resulting from a CACTA-like transposon insertion, delays bolting by reducing GA content through the direct suppression of LsGA20ox1 expression and the activation of LsRGA1 expression. Interestingly, LsOFP6 (OVATE family protein 6) functions as a regulatory brake by interacting with LsKN1TP, thereby attenuating its inhibitory effects on GA biosynthesis and signaling responses. This molecular brake mechanism can facilitate environmental adaptability in bolting rates observed in lettuce. In addition, Qi et al. investigated the expression levels of LsRGA1(REPRESSOR OF GA 1) across different types of lettuce and revealed lower expression values in stem-type cultivars. This observation raises intriguing questions about how domestication has shaped the genetic architecture of bolting-related traits. Under natural conditions, early bolting may confer adaptive advantages, such as ensuring reproductive success in a vast range of various environments. By contrast, delayed bolting is a trait favored in cultivated lettuce, where prolonged vegetative growth is essential for marketability. This divergence illustrates the evolutionary balance between natural selection in the wild and artificial selection during domestication, suggesting that domestication often results in purifying the selection of genomic regions that control agronomic traits favored by humans. The discovery of LsKN1 and its functional role in bolting regulation underscores the importance of exploring genetic variation within lettuce. Wild relative species are often used in crop breeding as a source of novel traits. Lettuce cultivars are domesticated from their progenitor, Lactuca serriola (Wei et al., 2021), which harbors a wealth of natural genetic diversity, shaped by millennia of evolutionary pressures in diverse environments. Lactuca serriola plays a vital role in lettuce breeding, serving as a donor for trait developments, such as carotenoid content, bolting time, water use efficiency, and resistance to diseases and insects (Chadha & Florentine, 2021). Hormonal cross-talk is central to coordinating complex developmental and stress-response pathways. For instance, abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA), both key regulators of stress responses, often antagonize each other and interact with GA signaling. This raises intriguing questions: can ABA or JA modulate GA-mediated bolting in lettuce? ABA, typically associated with drought responses, might delay bolting by antagonizing GA signaling under water-limited conditions. Similarly, JA, which is implicated in herbivore defense, could intersect with GA pathways to influence resource allocation during bolting. Investigating these interactions in L. serriola could uncover new regulatory mechanisms, such as how plants balance growth and defense during the vegetative-to-reproductive transition. Understanding these trade-offs could inform strategies to optimize resource allocation in cultivated lettuce. Additionally, plants of the Lactuca genus produce latex, particularly in the stem. This milky fluid, extracted from laticifers, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores by deterring pests with its bitter taste and sticky texture. More importantly, the latex contains natural rubber (cis-1,4-polyisoprene), an important plant derived bioproduct essential in the manufacture of over 40 000 products (Mooibroek & Cornish, 2000). Lactuca serriola shows a stronger ability to produce rubber than cultivated lettuce, along with a higher biomass yield (Bushman et al., 2006). It is also tolerant and well adapted to cultivation on marginal land, alleviating field competition with food crops. As such, it has great potential to be a new type of crop after de novo domestication (Li et al., 2018) for producing high-quality natural rubber. The fact that the synthesis of rubber takes a lot of energy out of the plant is another mystery. Considering that it cannot be metabolized, what value does it have to the plant? It has been suggested that rubber is produced in the plant as a response to its overproduction of photosynthesis and is therefore likely to be a metabolic 'spillover' (Paterson-Jones et al., 1990). Moreover, it has been reported that the initiation of flower signaling leads to the accumulation of latex. Is there a potential link between bolting and latex production? Could there be an energy metabolism trade-off, or is there a more efficient mechanism for energy allocation? Investigating this question from an evolutionary standpoint may offer deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms governing bolting in lettuce. Elucidation of this intriguing phenomenon not only deepens our understanding of bolting regulation in lettuce but can also facilitate the de novo domestication of wild lettuce to produce natural rubber. Qi et al.'s research exemplifies the power of leveraging natural genetic diversity to address key agricultural challenges. By identifying LsKN1 as a master regulator of bolting and linking its activity to hormonal signaling pathways, their study advances our understanding of lettuce development and provides actionable insights for breeding programs. Wild relatives like L. serriola are more than genetic resources for improving agronomic traits, they are living repositories of evolutionary adaptations. Traits, such as stress resilience and latex production, offer valuable lessons for enhancing plant productivity and defense. At the same time, the crosstalk between hormonal pathways like GA, ABA, and JA highlights the intricate regulatory networks that underpin plant development and survival. Preserving and studying wild lettuce populations is crucial for unlocking their full potential. As global agriculture faces mounting pressures from climate change and resource scarcity, L. serriola serves as a reminder of the untapped solutions inherent in nature's diversity. By integrating insights from wild and domesticated populations, researchers can bridge the gap between fundamental plant biology and applied agricultural innovation, ensuring a sustainable future for crop breeding.

https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1584652.v1,Response of fish biota to dams in the Lower Colorado River Basin: empirical findings and utility for predicting responses to climate and water use change,"Over the past century, development of the Colorado River Basin for water resources changed a dynamic river into a managed system. Seasonality in flow, temperature, and turbidity is reduced, and formerly riverine habitats are now reservoirs. These changes have played out in the fish fauna. Native species have declined and non-natives have increased. The key alteration, relative to the past, is increased competition and predation, especially at juvenile stages, which is likely mediated by more stable flow and resource regimes. A dataset (SONFISHES) assembled by W. L. Minckley and covering 150 years of fish occurrence in the Lower Colorado River (below Glen Canyon Dam) has provided insight into patterns in extirpation among native fishes and range expansion among non-native fishes. Several studies have combined these data with measures of extinction risk to explain how range fragmentation and species’ traits correlate with observed extinctions or threats in native species. Another study analyzed range shifts within a strategy space of potential fish life histories (originally introduced by K. O. Winemiller and K. A. Rose) to understand how human activity has created and removed ecological niches. Together, these studies support a causal link between environmental and faunal change. This strongly suggests that continuing the status quo will result in further extirpation and extinction of native fishes. I argue, however, that current knowledge is not yet sufficient to quantitatively forecast the magnitude and timescale of the response in fish biodiversity to any projected future environment. Such forecasting requires a model that quantitatively relates the environment to persistence in the strategy-space of fish life histories. Unfortunately, we do not need such a model to make the qualitative prediction: threatened “big-river” fishes will eventually go extinct without intervention.",W2258441801,True,0.9750744700431824
https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.71466,Effect of Resource Abundance on Woodland Rodents' Demography at Latitudinal Extremes in Europe,"Climate change effects on primary productivity are especially evident along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. Some of the species with a fast reproductive cycle strategy and relying on primary productivity may rapidly respond to such changes with alterations to demographic parameters. However, how these bottom-up effects may emerge in systems with different population dynamics has not been elucidated. We aimed to assess the role of food availability on rodent demography in populations characterised by different dynamics, that is multiannual cycles in Northern European populations and mast-driven outbreaks in Southern European populations, both driven by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We live-trapped woodland rodents at these latitudinal extremes in two study systems (Norway, Italy) while deploying control/treatment designs of food manipulation providing ad libitum trophic resource availability, albeit not reflecting the natural resource fluctuations. We applied a multistate open robust design model to estimate population patterns and survival rates while controlling for seasonal variation, intrinsic traits, and co-occurrence of sympatric species. Yellow-necked and wood mouse (Apodemus spp.) were sympatric with bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) in Italy, while only the latter was trapped in Norway. Food provisioning increased both survival and population size of bank vole in Norway, where temperatures are harsher and snow cover persists in winter. In milder Italian habitats, the wood mouse abundance was boosted by food availability, increasing also survival rates (but only in females), whereas the bank vole showed a decrease in both parameters across sexes. We speculate that overabundant food resources may trigger some forms of competition between sympatric wood mouse and bank vole, although other types of interactions, such as predation and parasitism, may also contribute. By manipulating food availability in two systems where rodents have different population dynamics, we showed how resource availability exerted bottom-up effects on rodent demography, especially in the context of climate change, although being mediated by other intrinsic and extrinsic factors.",W4411007675,True,0.9609933495521545
https://doi.org/10.3732/ajb.90.4.658,Understanding feedback between ecological systems requires feedback among scientists,"On a global scale, ecologists have long recognized the importance of feedback between aboveground and belowground ecological systems. In our general ecology classes, we teach that major world biomes are characterized by distinctive vegetation types, which are influenced both by climate and soil types. Soils, in turn, are a product of the mineral composition of the bedrock, the particular soil weathering action caused by that climate, and the physical and chemical characteristics of the organic matter returned to the soil by the vegetation. Soils and vegetation, students learn, are inextricably connected with each defining the identity of the other. In Communities and Ecosystems, Linking the Aboveground and Belowground Components, David Wardle examines how aboveground biological communities and ecosystems are linked to those in the soil at spatial scales smaller than a biome. He articulates his primary goal as considering terrestrial communities and ecosystems from a combined aboveground–belowground perspective in order to identify feedback between the two systems and to interpret how such feedback influences ecosystem functions such as carbon and nitrogen cycling. Wardle convincingly argues that understanding the linkages is important for predicting how changes in the components, including those caused by anthropogenic activity, affect ecosystem functions. Most linkages between aboveground and belowground ecological systems directly or indirectly involve plants, and thus a consideration of how plants interact with other organisms serves as a major, but unstated, theme of this book. Plants earn this level of attention because input of plant litter is the primary resource for decomposer food chains in the soil, and by the nature of a vascular plant's existence it extends simultaneously above- and belowground. If interactions with other organisms in either system affect plant performance, repercussions are likely to occur in the other system simply because the plant exists there as well. Although plants serve as a logical focal point, Wardle's task is still an enormous one. The goals he sets out for himself require that he consider nearly all terrestrial organisms—starting with the invertebrate and microbial components of decomposer soil food webs and including a consideration of the intraspecific and interspecific variation in plant traits that influence interactions with herbivores and the decomposers. By his inclusive definition of aboveground–belowground linkages, he must also consider the actions of all organisms that feed on or parasitize plants or interact with them in a beneficial fashion either above- or belowground. Even animals that feed at higher trophic levels cannot be ignored as their excretory wastes and decaying carcasses are sources of nutrient input into the soil. Most of us work with only one or a few components of these systems; we may not think about each system in its entirety, let alone all the connections between the systems. … there have been few attempts to bring together the widely dispersed literature on aboveground and belowground communities or to interpret this in an ecosystem context. This is because aboveground and belowground ecology have traditionally developed largely independently of one another; the two subdisciplines usually publish in different journals or bodies of literature. In this light it is perhaps not surprising that often a finding that has been hailed as a breakthrough in one subdiscipline has long been common knowledge to the other. The breadth of information Wardle covers in connecting these subdisciplines is, in fact, impressive. As a plant ecologist with little prior knowledge of soil fauna, I learned a great deal, for example, about the diversity and interactions of soil invertebrates. Wardle presents this literature by addressing the question of whether decomposer food webs are regulated by “top-down” predators or “bottom-up” resource availability. Understanding the nature of the controls is important to interpreting how these systems respond to changes in the quantity and quality of plant litter. This example serves as a nice illustration of why we must understand how a system operates before we can understand how a linkage to another system affects it. Still, no one person can be an expert on the diverse subjects addressed here, and I think that a collaborative effort among aboveground and belowground ecologists would have been a more productive approach. A collaborative effort among experts in the disparate fields—perhaps beginning with a workshop—could have increased the level of information synthesis and served as a forum stimulating conversation between soil scientists and aboveground ecologists who, according to Wardle, have traditionally not talked to one another. Wardle himself has published extensively and broadly in the area of aboveground–belowground interactions and thus is as qualified as any single individual to write a book of this scope. Nevertheless, the quality of the synthesis and the readability of the material varies greatly, seemingly dependent on his familiarity with the literature. Wardle devotes considerable attention to the questions of whether increased plant species diversity begets either increased net primary productivity or increased community or ecosystem stability. He has contributed previously to the literature debates these questions have generated, and he justifies their inclusion here because primary productivity ultimately determines the quantity of litter available to soil biota and because the diversity of plants and the diversity of soil organisms are potentially related. Central to both questions is whether an increase in the number of plant species generally represents either an increase in the number of plant functional types, with species exhibiting low overlap in niche space and greater resource partitioning, or an increase in positive interactions among species. Such phenomena are necessary to link productivity or stability to species diversity directly (Tilman et al., 1996, 1997). An alternative explanation, especially for studies that vary diversity experimentally by drawing different numbers of species at random from the same species pool, is based on purely statistical grounds. More diverse systems can be more productive or more stable simply because an increase in the number of species increases the probability that key productive (or resilient) species are included in a particular experimental plot (Aarssen, 1997; Huston, 1997). Wardle's strong preference for the latter explanation is apparent in his analysis of the literature. Wardle does not give other potentially controversial topics as much attention. For example, he mentions the possibility that plants share carbon through mycorrhizal hyphae and cites but does not discuss studies pointing out the difficulties in demonstrating its functional importance (Fitter et al., 1998; Newbery et al., 2000). Still, he says, if fungal hyphae reduce competition then “fungal-regulated positive interactions might not be uncommon in plant communities.” An examination of evidence that could shed light on whether hyphal connections among plants are common and biologically important to the plants (or the fungi) would have been welcome. Could we draw relevant information from the plant competition literature? Are the combined effects of competition between roots and any facilitation that might occur through fungal hyphal connections likely to result in net positive belowground interactions between neighboring plants? Just how common IS facilitation through belowground interactions, even if the mechanism cannot be identified? The reduced level of synthesis applied to some subjects also made for dry reading. Again, I expect this reflects the fact that Wardle is less familiar with these particular subjects and not that the information is inherently less interesting or controversial. For example, the chapter “Belowground Consequences of Aboveground Foodwebs” mostly summarizes how herbivory varies with particular leaf traits and how these same leaf traits affect the quality of leaf litter returned to the soil, with little interpretation of the information. He makes a secondary point related to the “not-so-novel” idea that dung and urine impact soil resources, explaining that the animals making these deposits may travel over considerable distances and into different habitats, potentially impacting communities beyond the one in which they fed. While linkages between aboveground and belowground ecological systems are indeed numerous and some of them complex, many can be collapsed into the framework of what is often called plant–soil feedback in the current literature. In this context, ecologists are particularly interested in how plants affect the abundance and diversity of soil organisms with which they interact and how these organisms, in turn, affect the performance of different plant species. The relevant soil organisms include root herbivores and both free-living microbes and those forming associations with plants, such as nitrogen-fixing bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi. Wardle includes several examples. Plant–soil feedback is either characterized as positive, whereby a particular plant species propagates an associated biota that improves the performance of that species relative to other plants, or negative, whereby the associated biota reduce plant performance. Beneficial effects of microbes include increased levels of nutrient mineralization, nitrogen fixation, suppression of pathogens, and production of substances promoting plant growth. Negative feedback can be expressed through the action of host-specific pathogens or mechanisms by which plants and microbes compete for nutrients. Negative feedback may even involve mutualists, such as mycorrhizal fungi, if they differ in their level of host specificity or confer different levels of benefit to different hosts (Bever et al., 2002). Such phenomena have clear implications for the maintenance of species diversity in both the soil and plant communities. Wardle mentions “a vast agronomic and biotechnological literature” about how several types of interactions with microbes affect the growth of crop plants, but he limits his discussion to ecological studies that have dealt with nutrient transformations, pathogens, and mycorrhizae and refers the reader to several reviews of the agricultural literature. I think it likely that many findings of agricultural studies could be applicable to ecological systems, and including some discussion of them here might have suggested new lines of research to ecologists. In the introduction, Wardle discusses why studies of the soil biota are so challenging, making soil communities still a largely unexplored frontier: (1) The physical and chemical structure of the soil is complex, and it is difficult to study even macroorganisms in situ within such a complex, opaque matrix. (This explains, for example, why we know many times more about the activity and consequences of aboveground herbivores than about those operating strictly belowground.) (2) Soil communities generally contain far more species than aboveground communities occupying comparable space, perhaps because the microhabitats are more diverse and complex. (3) Countless species of soil organisms remain unidentified. It is estimated that less than 0.1% of soil microbial species and 10% of the soil microarthopods (André et al., 2002) have been described. Considering Wardle's broad statements about our limited knowledge of the underground biological world, I find it surprising that he omits coverage of recent technological advances that seem to be revolutionizing the ecological study of soil microbes, moving the field beyond traditional culturing techniques that have failed to capture so many species. One approach characterizes microbial communities based on phylogenetically relevant variation in important biological molecules such as nucleic acids or phospholipid fatty acids (Hill et al., 2000). Microbial genes can be extracted directly from the soil and their sequences compared with those of known organisms, and fluorescently labeled taxon-specific oligoncleotide probes can be used to identify taxonomic groups within their natural microenvironments. Analyses of cell wall fatty acids are informative because unique fatty acids serve as signature molecules in specific groups of microorganisms. Additionally, because cell walls rapidly degrade upon cell death, phospholipids prove useful as a measure of active microbial biomass. Still another approach examines microbial diversity through the physiological capabilities of community constituents (Hill et al., 2000; Waldrop et al., 2000). These profiles are often based on the activity of specific enzymes involved in the degradation of particular macromolecular carbon compounds, such as lignin or cellulose, or the microbes' ability to utilize a diversity of carbon-based substrates. Stable isotopes can be used as tracers to identify the role of microbes in carbon and nutrient cycling and to determine whether they compete with plants for the same pool of nutrient resources. These techniques allow researchers to examine the ecosystem functions of different microbial communities without determining their species compositions. While all of these methods have their limitations, their refinement should continue to speed progress in the exploration of the soil frontier, supplement information gained about ecosystem function from traditional experiments manipulating litter characteristics or soil inoculum (André et al., 2001), and improve our understanding of how feedback occurs between aboveground and belowground systems. Indeed, as Wardle points out, the more we learn about soil microbial communities, the more complicated their relationships with plants appear. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were once thought to be nonspecific in their choice of hosts, but now it is clear that the performance and thus the level of benefit experienced by both the plant and the fungus often depends on the identity of the partner species. The performance of a host plant may vary with the number of fungal species associated with its roots (van der Heijden et al., 1998a), and plant community diversity may be related to mycorrhizal fungal diversity (van der Heijden et al., 1998b). Recent evidence shows how plant–soil feedback can occur at microscales, as plant roots can influence the rate of nitrogen mineralization performed by bacteria in the rhizosphere (Firestone et al., 2002). The fact that plant performance and the outcome of plant competition can be greatly affected by the activity of soil microbes calls into question the ecological relevance of countless greenhouse experiments conducted over the last several decades without soil biota. These are studies where plants were grown in sterilized “soil-less” potting media, typically consisting of a mixture of ground peatmoss, vermiculite, or other inert ingredients to which inorganic nutrients were added. Wardle's last substantive chapter tackles the broad topic of how human activities are impacting ecological systems through effects on linked aboveground–belowground components. Initially, I was surprised to find so much of the book, roughly a sixth, devoted to conservation issues, but this chapter turned out to be a lucid and comprehensive explanation of how even small changes in climate or species composition can have far-reaching ecological repercussions. Within the context of aboveground–belowground linkages, it is easy to appreciate how anthropogenic perturbations can potentially alter basic ecosystem functions of carbon and nutrient cycling and feed back to affect species composition at different trophic levels. This chapter would serve as a solid synthetic review of the subject for a class reading assignment. Most of the major conservation issues are included: the introduction of exotic species, the selective removal of key ecologically important native species, large-scale and long-term changes in land use, increased nitrogen deposition, CO2 enrichment, and global climate changes caused by changes in the composition of atmospheric gases. Wardle explains very well how the introduction of invasive species can alter species interactions and interrupt normal ecosystem function, but his coverage of species extinctions or deliberate, selective removal of particular species by humans is less informative. He dwells too much on the occurrence of historical large-scale extinctions of megafauna, such as happened in North America 10 000–12 000 years ago, without much evidence for how such losses affected the ecosystem. He speculates that “these extinctions have almost certainly profoundly affected the functional composition of the vegetation” based on what has been learned from studies of contemporary systems, and he refers the reader to an earlier chapter. Better data are apparently available on the ecological consequences of species additions. Wardle not only includes examples of exotic plants and aboveground herbivores but also exotic soil organisms. Earthworms have been well studied. Important consequences of non-native earthworms include changes to the physical soil structure, the overall composition of the soil biota, the accumulation of organic matter, and nutrient supply rates. Invasive plants can alter many of these same soil factors indirectly by causing changes in the quantity or quality of plant litter, with resultant changes in the cycling of carbon and nutrients and in the species composition of the decomposers. One active area of research with invasive plants focuses on how plant–soil feedback figures in their success, i.e., to what extent changes induced belowground by the invaders hinder the reestablishment of native vegetation (Klironomos, 2002). Wardle also presents a seemingly comprehensive description of how nitrogen and CO2 enrichment are likely to affect ecosystems, primarily through their fertilization effects on plants. By increasing primary productivity they can increase the quantity of litter available to decomposers, but they can also alter the chemical constituents of leaves in ways that alter the rate of decomposition and shift the constituents of decomposer food webs. Direct effects of nitrogen deposition on soil microbes can also occur but are less predictable. Climate changes as a consequence of elevated CO2 levels are expected to involve a 3°C increase in air temperatures, more temporal variability in precipitation, and more extreme weather events in general. He reviews how these changes may affect primary productivity, the composition of the vegetation, and the geographic ranges of plant species. Understandably, the soil biota is much more likely to respond directly to changes in moisture availability than to temperature increases of the expected magnitude, although large increases are predicted in the rate of decomposition and the loss of carbon through respiration of soil organisms. I would have liked more discussion of how climate-induced changes in the composition of the vegetation may mitigate or exacerbate soil carbon loss through increased soil respiration. He mentions some exchanges on these questions in the literature but does not elaborate. Finally, I feel obligated to comment on the organizational style of the book. Although every chapter ends with a section entitled “Synthesis,” these sections are largely chapter summaries, with the amount of synthetic analysis reflecting the amount contained in the chapter itself, which varies greatly. To the extent that these sections do provide a new synthesis of the material already covered, incorporating these ideas into the chapter would have made the factual material more interesting. The final chapter, entitled “Underlying Themes,” likewise serves mainly as a summary and does little to tie the information together in new ways. Wardle does do a commendable job summarizing the different ways that aboveground and belowground ecological processes are connected. However, given his uneven development of the diverse topics included in this book, I believe that aboveground and belowground ecologists would be better informed of and inspired by the others' research if they could speak for themselves. I am reminded of the story of how several blind men give completely different descriptions of an elephant based on the small portion of the animal each is able to touch. The same concept need not apply to the descriptions of ecosystems. The latter may be a case where the “elephant” could be better described and understood by the combined efforts of several individuals, each of whom is an expert on some component but who may be unfamiliar with the rest of the “animal.”",W1990778063,True,0.9883975982666016
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000398,Invaders on the Wing,"​TheThe deliberate or accidental introduction of species beyond their natural range has been one of the major consequences of the growth of trade, travel, and tourism in recent times. Many introduced species fail to establish or to spread significantly, but many others become successful invaders. Invasive alien species can transform natural ecosystems and cause extinctions of native species. As a result, invasive species are now recognized in the IUCN Red List as one of the main threats to native biodiversity worldwide. In some parts of the world, especially on oceanic islands and previously isolated landmasses, they are arguably now a more important threat than factors such as habitat loss or overexploitation, which tend to preoccupy conservationists in continental landscapes that humans have modified over thousands of years. For example, in New Zealand there is now a major “biosecurity” focus on preventing new invasions, eradicating introduced mammals from offshore islands, and managing a suite of invasive species on the mainland. Blackburn TM, Lockwood JL, Cassey P (2009) Avian Invasions: The Ecology and Evolution of Exotic Birds. New York: Oxford University Press. 320p. ISBN (paperback): 978-0-19-923255-0. US$55.00. To deal effectively with invasive species, it is clearly important to understand the processes of biological invasion. If, by studying the “unnatural experiments” of past species introductions, insights can also gained into fundamental ecological processes, so much the better. Although birds are very well-studied in many other contexts and are a common cause of conservation concern, they have received relatively little attention as biological invaders, compared with mammals, for example. This is despite the fact that the history and success or failure of avian introductions around the world is relatively well-documented. Since there is also a large amount of information on the distribution, ecology, and evolution of birds in general, this means that exotic birds provide excellent opportunities for examining the major stages of biological invasion and addressing important questions about the factors that facilitate invasions. The new book Avian Invasions: The Ecology and Evolution of Exotic Birds, by Tim Blackburn, Julie Lockwood, and Phillip Cassey, is therefore very timely and topical in its synthesis of the hitherto neglected subjects of the ecology and evolution of exotic birds. The book is structured around widely accepted stages of the invasion pathway: transport and introduction, establishment, spread, and invasive impact. It concludes with chapters on the ecology, genetics, and evolution of exotic birds, and lessons learned from the study of avian invasions. Throughout the book, the authors not only critically review the existing literature on biological invasions in general and avian invasions in particular; they also make several excellent suggestions for future research. The book starts with a brief but interesting history of bird introductions and a summary of the general invasion pathway. From the outset, the authors point out some of the problems in trying to draw scientific conclusions from historical data, which are often biased in terms of taxon, location, and time period. The bird species chosen for introduction reflected societal demands at the time, with the result that more than half of all known avian introductions come from only five families, which contain less than 15% of extant birds. Gamebirds, parrots, and passerines are over-represented among introduced birds because they were disproportionately selected for introduction as hunting quarry, as ornamental species, or as songbirds. Common bird species may also have been more likely to be successfully introduced; for example, common British birds were introduced to New Zealand in larger numbers. Overall, more than two thirds of bird introductions have been to islands, which comprise only a small fraction of the world's land area, and a disproportionate number of introductions have been made to Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands. Despite such shortcomings in the historical data, the authors illustrate throughout the book how the rigorous analysis of past introductions can still yield some powerful insights into invasion processes. The first two stages of the invasion pathway are transport and introduction. These are considered together as the subject of the second chapter, with a focus on evidence for non-randomness in both stages. The authors point out that a consistent thread running through analyses of character selectivity is that the “availability” of a species is important for its success; large geographic range size and/or population size are predictors of transport and introduction probability. The third stage of invasion is the crucial one of establishment, and this is the subject of chapters 3–5, which progressively consider the roles of contingency, species traits, and location in relation to establishment success. It is widely agreed that “propagule pressure” (usually defined as the number of individuals introduced) is an important determinant of success. The authors argue why this would be expected, relating it to the challenges faced by small populations in general and presenting evidence for the relationship between propagule pressure and establishment success. They then go on to consider the role of species-level traits, where previous studies have generally failed to find associations with establishment success. By framing this issue in the context of small population biology, they successfully argue that general conclusions can be drawn about the importance of factors such as population growth rates, Allee effects (reduced population growth at low densities), and abilities to cope with novelty, in relation to the likelihood of successful establishment. Chapter 5 discusses the importance of recipient location, including the historically controversial topics of invasibility and the role of competition in determining establishment success. The authors successfully revisit these arguments and also address the other important biotic interactions of predation, parasitism, and mutualisms (such as pollination and seed dispersal). After establishment, the next phase of the invasion process is spread (which is discussed in Chapter 6). The authors review the general literature on geographic range expansion of invasive species and note the strong bias in substantial data from a few widespread and highly successful bird species (such as starlings and sparrows). Despite the taxonomic bias, this is a key area in which data on exotic birds have contributed substantially to our current understanding of one of the major stages of biological invasion. In the second part of the book, the authors move beyond the invasion pathway to consider the ecology, genetics, and evolution of exotic birds, lessons learned from the study of avian invasions, and some of the exciting research opportunities that they present. They review information on interactions between exotic birds and native species and consider how comparing data on phenomena, such as species-area relationships and latitudinal gradients of exotic and native birds, can contribute to general ecological understanding. For example, whereas native bird species richness on islands is a negative function of distance to the mainland, exotic bird species richness is a positive function of this distance because of where exotic species were introduced. The authors then summarise what is known about the impacts of exotic birds on native species and communities (i.e., effectively the final stage of the invasion pathway). These impacts include competition with native birds, predation, mutualisms (such as pollination and seed dispersal), and the role of exotic birds in disease transmission. Classic examples include the pollination and dispersal of native and introduced plant species by exotic birds in many ecosystems and the devastating transmission of avian malaria and avian pox from exotic birds to vulnerable native bird species in Hawaii. Chapters 8 and 9 take the longer-term, evolutionary perspective on the effects of successful avian invasions. Exotic birds have sometimes lost significant amounts of genetic variation during the introduction process, but in many cases there is no evidence of any such loss. There is, however, some evidence of evolution in phenotypes of exotic birds since they have established at new sites, despite the relatively short time frames involved. As is stressed by the authors, the “experiments in nature” represented by avian invasions, provide multiple (but so far under-utilized) opportunities for addressing basic questions in evolutionary ecology. The authors conclude their book by stating that a coherent picture is beginning to emerge of how introduced bird species move through stages of the invasion process. Significant and consistent themes include the role of humans; interactions between event, species, and location; and the importance of both the stochastic and the deterministic in the establishment and spread of exotic birds. They strongly advocate the use of transport/introduction patterns as null hypotheses in invasion ecology, suggesting that ecological explanations are needed when there is deviation from these human-mediated patterns. Overall, this is a comprehensive, up-to-date, and exciting book. It provides a much-needed stimulus for a greater focus on avian invasions and their effects on native biodiversity, but it also illustrates how the study of exotic birds can help to advance our general understanding of invasion ecology. I predict that it will become a classic text in invasion ecology, and I strongly commend it to all who are interested in this important and growing field.",W2063920018,True,0.9447259306907654
https://doi.org/10.5204/mcj.143,"""Gently Caress Me, I Love Chris Jericho"": Pro Wrestling Fans ""Marking Out""","“A bunch of faggots for watching men hug each other in tights.”For the past five Marches, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) has produced an awards show which honours its aged former performers, such as Jimmy “Superfly” Snuka and Ricky “The Dragon” Steamboat, as pro-wrestling Legends. This awards show, according to WWE, is ‘an elegant, emotional, star-studded event that recognizes the in-ring achievements of the inductees and offers historical insights into this century-old sports-entertainment attraction’ (WWE.com, n.p.). In an episodic storyline leading up to the 2009 awards, however, the real-life personal shortcomings of these Legends have been brought to light, and subsequently mocked in one-on-one interview segments with WWE’s Superstar of the Year 2008, the dastardly Chris Jericho. Jericho caps off these tirades by physically assaulting the Legends with handy stage props. Significantly, the performances of Jericho and his victims have garnered positive attention not only from mass audiences unaware of backstage happenings in WWE, but also from the informed community of pro-wrestling fans over at the nihilistic humour website SomethingAwful. During Jericho’s assault on the Legend Jimmy “Superfly” Snuka at the March 02 WWE Raw event, a WWE-themed forum thread on SomethingAwful logged over sixty posts all reiterating variations of ‘gently caress me Jericho is amazing’ (Jerusalem, n.p.). This is despite the community’s passive-aggressive and ironically jaded official line that they indeed are ‘a bunch of faggots for watching men hug each other in tights. Thank you for not telling us this several times’ (HulkaMatt, n.p.). Why were these normally cynical fans of WWE enthusiastically expressing their love for the Jericho-Legends feud? In order to answer this question, this paper argues that the feud articulates not only the ideal of the “giving wrestler”, but also Roland Barthes’s version of jouissance. Consuming and commenting on WWE texts within the SomethingAwful community is further argued to be a performative ritual in which informed wrestling fans distance themselves from audiences they perceive as uncritical and ill-informed cultural dupes. The feud, then, allows the SomethingAwful fans to perform enthusiasm on two interconnected levels: they are not only able to ironically cheer on Jericho’s morally reprehensible actions, but also to genuinely appreciate the present-day in-ring efforts of the Legends. The Passion of the SuperflyTo properly contextualise this paper, though, the fact that “pro wrestling is fake” needs to be reiterated. Each match is a choreographed sequence of moves. Victory does not result from landing more damaging bodyslams than one's opponent, but is instead predetermined by scriptwriters—among whom wrestlers are typically not numbered—backstage. In the 1950s, Roland Barthes thus commented that pro wrestling ‘is not a sport, it is a spectacle’ (Mythologies 13). Yet, pro wrestling remains popular because this theatricality allows for the display of spectacular excesses of passion—here Barthes not only means “an intensity of emotion”, but refers to the physically tortured heroes of medieval passion plays as well—giving it an advantage over the legitimate sport of amateur wrestling. ‘It is obvious that at such a pitch, it no longer matters whether the passion is genuine or not. What the public wants is the image of passion, not passion itself’ (Mythologies 16). This observation still holds true in today’s WWE. On one hand, the SomethingAwful fans go ‘gently caress Jericho, [Superfly] will MURDER you’ (Jerusalem, n.p.) in disapproval of Jericho’s on-screen actions. In the same thread, though, they simultaneously fret over him being slightly injured from an off-screen real life accident. ‘Jericho looks busted up on his forehead. Dang’ (Carney, n.p.).However, Barthes’s observations, while seminal, are not the be-all and end-all of pro wrestling scholarship. The industry has undergone a significant number of changes since the 1950s. Speeches and interview segments are now seen as essential tools for furthering storylines. Correspondingly, they are given ample TV time. At over ten minutes, the Jericho-“Superfly” confrontation from the March 02 Raw is longer than both the matches following it, and a fifteen minute conversation between two top wrestlers capstones these two matches. Henry Jenkins has thus argued that pro wrestling is a male-targeted melodrama. Its ‘writers emphasize many traits that [legitimate sports such as] football share with melodrama-the clear opposition between characters, the sharp alignment of audience identification, abrupt shifts in fortune, and an emotionally satisfying resolution’ (Jenkins, “Never Trust a Snake” 81). Unlike football, though, the predetermined nature of pro wrestling means that its events can be ‘staged to ensure maximum emotional impact and a satisfying climax’ (Jenkins, “Never Trust a Snake” 81). Further, Jenkins notes that shouting is preferred over tears as an outlet for male affect. It ‘embodies externalised emotion; it is aggressive and noisy. Women cry from a position of emotional (and often social) vulnerability; men shout from a position of physical and social strength (however illusory)’ (Jenkins, “Never Trust a Snake” 80). Pro wrestling is seen to encourage this outlet for affect by offering its viewers spectacles of male physical prowess to either castigate or cheer. Jericho’s assault of the Legends, coupled with his half-screaming, half-shouting taunts of “‘Hall of Famer’? ‘Hall of Famer’ of what? You’re a has-been! Just like all the rest!” could be read to fit within this paradigm as well. Smarts vs. MarksWWE has repeatedly highlighted its scripted nature in recent years. During a 2007 CNN interview, for instance, WWE Chairman Vince McMahon constantly refers to his product as “entertainment” and laughingly agrees that “it’s all story” when discussing his on-screen interactions with his long-lost midget “son” (Griffin, n.p.). These overt acknowledgments that WWE is a highly choreographed melodrama have boosted the growth of a fan demographic referred to the ""smart"" in pro-wrestling argot. This “smart” fan is a figure for whom the fabricated nature of pro-wrestling necessitates an engagement with the WWE spectacle at a different level from mass audiences. The “smart” not only ‘follow[s] the WWE not just to see the shows, but to keep track of what “the Fed[eration]” is doing’ (McBride and Bird 170) with regards to off-camera events, but also 'has knowledge of the inner-workings of the wrestling business’ (PWTorch, n.p.). One of the few “GOLD”-rated threads on the SomethingAwful smart forums, accordingly, is titled “WWE News and Other Top Stories, The Insider Thread”, and has nearly 400 000 views and over 1000 posts. As a result, the smarts are in a subject position of relative insider-ness. They consume the WWE spectacle at a deeper level—one which functions roughly like an apparatus of capture for the critical/cynical affect mobilised around the binary of ‘real’ and ‘fake’—yet ultimately remain captured by the spectacle through their autodidact enthusiasm for knowledge which uncovers its inner workings.By contrast, there is the category of the “mark” fan. These “marks” are individuals who remain credulous in their reception of WWE programming. As cuteygrl08 writes regarding a recent WWE storyline involving brotherly envy:I LOVE JEFF HARDY!!!! i cried when i heard his brother say all the crap about him!! kinda weird but i love him and this video is soooo good!! JEFF hardy loves his fans and his fans love him no matter what he does i'll always love JEFF HARDY!!!!!!!!!!! (n.p.)This unstinting faith in the on-screen spectacle is understandable insofar as WWE programming trades upon powerful visual markers of authenticity—nearly-bare bodies, sweat, pained facial expressions­—and complements them with the adrenaline-producing beats of thrash metal and hard rock. Yet, smarts look down upon marks like cuteygrl08, seeing them as Frankfurt School-era hypnotised sots for whom the WWE spectacle is ‘the common ground of the deceived gaze and of false consciousness’ (Debord 117), and additionally as victims of a larger media industry which specialises in mass deception (Horkheimer and Adorno 41). As Lawrence McBride and Elizabeth Bird observe:Marks appear to believe in the authenticity of the competition—Smarts see them as the stereotypical dupes imagined by wrestling critics. Smarts approach the genre of wrestling as would-be insiders, while Marks root unreflexively for the most popular faces. Smart fans possess truly incredible amounts of knowledge about the history of wrestling, including wrestler’s real names and career histories, how various promotions began and folded, who won every Wrestlemania ever. Smart fan informants defined a Mark specifically as someone who responds to wrestling in the way intended by the people who write the storylines (the bookers), describing Marks with statements such as “Kids are Marks.” or “We were all Marks when we were kids.” Smarts view Marks with scorn. (169)Perhaps feeding on the antagonistic binaries drawn by WWE programming, there exists an “us vs them” binary in smart fan communities. Previous research has shown that fan communities often rigidly police the boundaries of “good taste”, and use negatively constructed differences as a means of identity construction (Fiske 448; Jenkins, “Get a Life!” 432; Theodoropoulou 321). This ritual Othering is especially important when supporting the WWE. Smarts are aware that they are fans of a product denigrated by non-fans as ‘trash TV’ (McKinley, n.p.). As Matt Hills finds, fandom is a mode of performative consumption. It is ‘an identity which is (dis)claimed, and which performs cultural work’ (Hills xi). Belonging to the SomethingAwful smart community, thus, exerts its own pressures on the individual smart. There, the smart must perform ‘audiencehood, knowing that other fans will act as a readership for speculation, observation, and commentaries’ (Hills 177). Wrestling, then, is not just to be watched passively. It must be analysed, and critically dissected with reference to the encyclopaedic knowledge treasured by the smart community. Mark commentary has to be pilloried, for despite all the ironic disaffection characterising their posts, the smarts display mark-like behaviour by watching and purchasing WWE programming under their own volition. A near-existential dread is hence articulated when smarts become aware of points where the boundaries between smart and mark overlap, that ‘the creatures that lurk the internet...carry some of the same interests that we do’ (rottingtrashcan, n.p.). Any commonalities between smarts and marks must thus be disavowed as a surface resemblance: afterall, creatures are simply unthinking appetites, not smart epicures. We’re better than those plebs; in fact, we’re nothing like them any more. Yet, in one of the few forms of direct address in the glossary of smart newsletter PWTorch, to “mark out” is ‘to enthusiastically be into [a storyline] or match as if you [emphasis added] were “a mark”; to suspend one's disbelief for the sake of enjoying to a greater extent a match or [a storyline]’ (PWTorch, n.p.). The existence of the term “marking out” in a smart glossary points to an enjoyably liminal privileged position between that of defensively ironic critic and that of credulous dupe, one where smarts can stop their performance of cooler-than-thou fatigue and enthusiastically believe that there is nothing more to WWE than spontaneous alarms and excursions. The bodily reactions of the Legends in response to Jericho's physical assault helps foster this willing naiveté. These reactions are a distressing break from the generic visual conventions set forth by preceding decades of professional wrestling. As Barthes argues, wrestling is as much concerned with images of spectacular suffering as with narratives of amazing triumphs:the wrestler who suffers in a hold which is reputedly cruel (an arm- lock, a twisted leg) offers an excessive portrayal of Suffering; like a primitive Pieta, he exhibits for all to see his face, exaggeratedly contorted by an intolerable affliction. It is obvious, of course, that in wrestling reserve would be out of place, since it is opposed to the voluntary ostentation of the spectacle, to this Exhibition of Suffering which is the very aim of the fight. (17)Barthes was writing of the primitively filmed wrestling matches of the 1950s notable for their static camera shots. However, WWE wrestlers yet follow this theatrical aesthetic. In the match immediately following Jericho’s bullying of Superfly, Kane considerately jumps the last two feet into a ringside turnbuckle after Mike Knox pushes him into its general vicinity. Kane grunts at the impact while the camera cuts to a low-angled shot of his back—all the better to magnify the visual of the 150 kg Knox now using his bulk to squash Kane. Whenever Jericho himself traps his opponent in his “Walls of Jericho” submission manoeuvre, both their faces are rictuses of passion. His opponent clutches for the safety of the ring ropes, shaking his head in heroic determination. Audiences see Jericho tighten his grip, his own head shaking in villainous purpose. But the Legends do not gyrate around the set when hit. Instead, they invariably slump to the ground, motionless except for weakly spasming to the rhythm of Jericho’s subsequent attacks. This atypical reaction forces audiences—smart and mark alike—to re-evaluate any assumptions that the event constitutes a typical WWE beatdown. Overblown theatricality gives way to a scene which seems more related to everyday experiences with pain: Here's an old man being beaten and whipped by a strong, young man. He's not moving. Not like other wrestlers do. I wonder... The battered bodies of these Legends are then framed in high angle camera shots, making them look ever so much more vulnerable than they were prior to Jericho’s assault. Hence the smart statements gushing that ‘gently caress me Jericho is amazing’ (Jerusalem, n.p.) and that Jericho’s actions have garnered a ‘rear end in a top hat chant [from the crowd]. It has been FOREVER since I heard one of those. I love Chris Jericho’ (Burrito, n.p.).Jouissance and “Marking Out”This uninhibited “marking out” by normally cynical smarts brings to mind Barthes's observation that texts are able to provoke two different kinds of enjoyment in their readers. On one hand, there is the text which provides pleasure born from familiarity. It ‘contents, fills, grants euphoria; [it is] the text that comes from culture and does not break with it, is linked to a comfortable practice of reading’ (Barthes, Image-Music-Text 14). The Knox-Kane match engendered such a been-there-done-that-it's-ok-I-guess overall reaction from smarts. For every ‘Mike Knox throwing Mysterio at Kane was fantastic’ (Burrito, n.p.), there is an ‘Ahahaha jesus Knox [sic] that was the shittiest Hurracanrana sell ever’ (Axisillian, n.p.), and a ‘Hit the beard [sic] it is Knox's weakpoint’ (Eurotrash, n.p.). The pleasant genericity of the match enables and necessitates that these smarts maintain their tactic of ironic posturing. They are able to armchair critique Knox for making his opponent's spinning Hurracanrana throw look painless. Yet they are also allowed to reiterate their camp affection for Knox's large and bushy beard, which remains grotesque even when divorced from a WWE universe that celebrates sculpted physiques.By contrast, Barthes praises the text of rapturous jouissance. It is one where an orgasmic intensity of pleasure is born from the unravelling of its audience’s assumptions, moving them away from their comfort zone. It is a text which ‘imposes a stage of loss, [a] text that discomforts (perhaps to the point of boredom), unsettles the reader's historical, cultural, psychological assumptions, the consistency of his tastes, values, memories, brings to crisis his relation with language’ (Barthes, Image-Music-Text 14). In addition to the atypical physical reactions of the Legends, WWE cynically positions the Jericho-Legends segments during Raw events which also feature slick video montages highlighting the accomplishments of individual Legends. These montages—complete with an erudite and enthusiastic Voice-of-God narrator— introduce the long-retired Legends to marks unfamiliar with WWE's narrative continuity: “Ladies and gentlemen! Rrriiiicky “The Draaagon” Steeeeamboat!”. At the same time, they serve as a visually and aurally impressive highlight-reel-cum-nostalgic-celebration of each Legend's career accomplishments. Their authoritative narration is spliced to clips of past matches, and informs audiences that, for instance, Steamboat was ‘one of the first Superstars to combine technical skills with astounding aerial agility... in a match widely regarded as one of the best in history, he captured the Intercontinental title from Randy Savage in front of a record-breaking 93 173 fans’ (“Raw #636”, WWE). Following the unassailably authentic video footage of past matches, other retired wrestlers speak candidly in non-WWE stages such as outdoor parks and their own homes about the Legend's strengths and contributions to the industry.The interesting thing about these didactic montages is not so much what they show —Legends mythologised into triumphant Titans — but rather, what they elide. While the Steamboat-centred package does reflect the smart consensus that his Intercontinental bout ‘was a technical classic, and to this day, is still considered one of the greatest matches of all-time’ (NPP, n.p.), it does not mention how Steamboat was treated poorly in the WWE. Despite coming to it as the widely-known World Champion of [the NWA] rival promotion, WWE producers ‘dressed Steamboat up as a dragon and even made him blow fire....To boot, he was never acknowledged as a World Champion and [kept losing] to the stars’ (NPP, n.p.). The montages, overtly endorsed by the gigantic WWE logo as they are, are ultimately pleasant illusions which rewrite inconvenient truths while glamorising pleasant memories.Jericho’s speeches, however, sharply break from this celebratory mode. He references Steamboat’s previous success in the NWA, ‘an organisation that according to this company never even existed’(“Raw #636”, WWE). He then castigates Steamboat for being a real-life sellout and alludes to Steamboat having personal problems unmentioned in the montage:It wasn't until you came to the WWE that you sold your soul to all of these parasites [everyone watching] that you became “The Dragon”. A glorified Karate Kid selling headbands and making poses. Feeding into stereotypes. And then you eventually came to the ring with a Komodo Dragon. Literally spitting fire like the circus freak you'd become. It was pathetic. But hey, it's all right as long as you're making a paycheck, right Steamboat? And then when you decided to retire, you ended up like all the rest. Down and out. Broken. Beaten down. Dysfunctional family...You applied for a job working for the WWE, you got one working backstage, and now here you are. You see, Steamboat, you are a life-long sellout. And now, with the Hall of Fame induction, the loyal dog gets his bone. (WWE)Here, Jericho demonstrates an apparent unwillingness to follow the company line by not only acknowledging the NWA, but also by disrespecting a current WWE backstage authority. Yet, wrestlers having onscreen tangles with their bosses is the norm for WWE. The most famous storyline of the 1990s had “Stone Cold” Steve Austin and the WWE Chairman brutalising each other for months on end, and the fifteen minute verbal exchange mentioned earlier concerns one wrestler previously attacking the Raw General Manager. Rather, it is Jericho’s reinterpretation of Steamboat’s career trajectory which gives the storyline the intensely pleasurable uncertainty of jouissance. His confrontational speeches rupture the celebratory nostalgia of the montages, forcing smarts to apply extra-textual knowledge to them. This is especially relevant in Steamboat’s case. His montage was shown just prior to his meeting with Jericho, ensuring that his iconic status was fresh in the audience’s memory. Vera Dika’s findings on the conflict between memory and history in revisionist nostalgia films are important to remember here. The tension ‘that comes from the juxtaposition of the coded material against the historical context of the film itself...encourages a new set of meanings to arise’ (Dika 91). Jericho cynically views the seemingly virtuous and heroic Steamboat as a corporate sycophant preying on fan goodwill to enrich his own selfish ends. This viewpoint, troublingly enough for smarts, is supported by their non-WWE-produced extra-textual knowledge, allowing for a meta-level melodrama to be played out. The speeches thus speak directly to smarts, simultaneously confounding and exceeding their expectations. The comfortingly pleasant memories of Steamboat’s “amazing aerial prowess” are de-emphasised, and he is further linked to the stereotypical juvenilia of the once-popular The Karate Kid. They articulate and capitalise upon whatever misgivings smarts may have regarding Steamboat’s real-life actions. Thus, to paraphrase Dika, ‘seen in this clash, [the Jericho-Legends feud] has the structure of irony, producing a feeling of nostalgia, but also of pathos, and registering the historical events as the cause of an irretrievable loss [of a Legend’s dignity]’ (91). “C’mon Legend! Live in the past!” taunts Jericho as he stuffs Superfly’s mouth with bananas and beats him amidst the wreckage of the exactingly reproduced cheap wooden set in the same way that “Rowdy” Roddy Piper did years ago (“RAW #637”, WWE). This literal dismantling of cherished memories results from WWE producers second-guessing the smarts, and providing these fans with an enjoyably uncomfortable jouissance that cleverly confounds the performance of a smart disaffection. “Marking out” —or its performance at least—results.The Giving WrestlerLastly, the general physical passivity of the Legends also ties into the ethos of the “giving wrestler” when combined with the celebratory montages. In a business where performed passion is integral to fan enjoyment, the “giving wrestler” is an important figure who, when hit by a high-risk move, will make his co-worker’s offense look convincing (McBride and Bird 173). He ‘will give his all in a performance to ensure a dual outcome: the match will be spectacular, benefiting the fans, and each wrestler will make his “opponent” look good, helping him “get over with the fans” (McBride and Bird 172). Unsurprisingly, this figure is appreciated by smarts, who ‘often form strong emotional attachments to those wrestlers who go to the greatest lengths to bear the burden of the performance’ (McBride and Bird 173). As described earlier, the understated reactions of the Legends make Jericho’s attacks paradoxically look as though they cause extreme pain. Yet, when this pathetic image of the Legends is combined with the hypermasculine images of them in their heyday, a tragedy with real-life referents is played out on-stage. In one of Jenkins’s ‘abrupt shifts of fortune’ (“Never Trust a Snake” 81), age has grounded these Legends. They can now believably be assaulted with impunity by someone that Steamboat dismisses as ‘a snotty brat wrestler of a kid[sic]...a hypocrite’ (“Raw #636”, WWE), and even in this, they apparently give their all to make Jericho look viciously “good”, thus exceeding the high expectations of smarts. As an appreciative thread title on SomethingAwful states, ‘WWE Discussion is the RICKY STEAMBOAT OWN [wins] ZONE for 02/23/09’ (HulkaMatt, n.p.) ConclusionThe Jericho-Legends feud culminated the day after the Hall of Fame ceremony, at the WWE’s flagship Wrestlemania event. Actor Mickey Rourke humiliated Jericho for the honour of the Legends, flattening the cocky braggart with a single punch. The maximum degree of moral order possible was thus temporarily restored to an episodic narrative centred around unprovoked acts of violence. Ultimately though, it is important to note the three strategies that WWE used The Legends were scripted to respond feebly to Jericho’s physical assault, slick recap montages were copiously deployed, and Jericho himself was allowed candid metatextual references to incidents that WWE producers normally like to pretend have “never even existed”. All these strategies were impressive in their own right, and they eventually served to reinforce each other. They shocked the SomethingAwful smart community, celebrated its autodidact tendencies, and forced it to re-evaluate pleasant memories. Such producer strategies enabled these smarts to re-discover jouissance and perform a rapturously regressive “marking out”.

https://doi.org/10.5325/style.54.2.0246,Review,"Complexity, or the study of complex systems, has been around for decades in sciences and social sciences but has a much lighter footprint in humanities. The two books under review are both collections, similar in their titles but very different in their form of organization and the ethos of the way they have been edited. Both are bringing narrative theory to bear on the study of complex systems, and vice versa, but with quite disparate results. Humanists having their first close encounter with complexity science may find it more rewarding to begin with the Walsh/Stepney collection (abbreviated as NC) and to take up the Grishakova/Poulaki volume (NCCEE) at some later point.Complexity science itself, as John Pier put it, “is… a loose ad hoc federation of sciences… ranging from physics, cybernetics, biology, immunology, cognitive science and meteorology to sociology”; it studies “organizations including ant colonies and multinational corporations as well as economics, the stock market, city planning and traffic patterns” (Pier 535–36). All systems have components and levels. What defines a complex system, according to Susan Stepney, is “strong interaction between components, feedback between levels, emergence, self-organization, openness, adaptation, growth, and change” (NC 27). Complex systems behave as wholes that are greater than the sum of the individual parts: ant colonies create nests as though there was an architect directing their work, with individual ant behavior regulated through chemical pheromones. In an ecological system in which there is vegetation eaten by herbivores and herbivores hunted and eaten by carnivores, we might find an interaction between the components and feedback between levels. A weather pattern causing the vegetation to decline would also cause the herbivore population to decline, in turn causing greater competition among the carnivores for the available prey. We also might see the emergence of a new behavior adapted to conditions: to assure group survival individuals of one species of carnivores might begin to hunt in packs instead of independently (NC 30).The primary question posed in Narrating Complexity, though, is whether we can fully understand the workings of complex systems as narrative. In an influential Poetics Today essay, Porter Abbott urged us to “take the case of an Eohippus, a diminutive ancestor of the horse, who lived roughly fifty million years ago in the Eocene. We can follow the events of his life—his birth, the frolics of his youth, his near starvation from want of grass to eat, his hairbreadth escapes from predators, his successful mating with a mare who bears two foals (who in their turn grow and mate and reproduce), and finally his passing away. This is a chain of events that can be easily cast as a narrative” (34–35). Abbott calls this a micronarrative. We can also understand, at least abstractly, the macronarrative of the sequence of species: the evolution of Eohippus through at least eight intermediate stages to the modern horse, Equus, which spread throughout the continents of both hemispheres about five million years ago. However, what we cannot grasp as a narrative, Abbott argues, is what lies in between the micronarrative and the micronarrative, the complex system involving mutations, changes in climate, and the evolving pattern of flora and fauna within which the ancestors of the horse lived over 50 million years, including millions of micronarratives like that of the little Eohippus that could. Richard Walsh, in dialogue with Stepney, raises the very same issue: “If a complex system involves a network of interactions all going on together in reciprocal and recursive ways, a narrative might trace one or other sequence within that network, but it can't possibly capture the systemic nature of what is happening” (NC 4). To which Stepney replies: “We can construct models and run simulations, and these can often show how systemic interactions can produce the emergent behaviour of the system” (5). And showing—as an alternative to telling—is a time-honored mode of narrative.In the dialogue with which Narrating Complexity begins, we explore the adaptations made by Walsh the narratologist and Stepney the computer scientist as they come to understand the disparate ways they themselves are accustomed to think and to communicate their thoughts. This gives rise to the project of mutual dialogue whose product is the book itself. Walsh and Stepney first created a network, primarily within the UK, but with participants from Portugal, Italy, and Finland. The network included scholars and scientists from a wide variety of fields, touching on complex system theory, who would attempt to explain their current work in terms of the telling of narratives and the showing of models and simulations. On the other side, the network included narrative theorists who would consider the extent to which various genres of narrative itself, in the complex feedback loops that are created between characters and events, narrators, and readers, constitute complex systems on their own. These position papers make up eleven of the 23 chapters in Narrating Complexity. But the rest of the book consists of dialogues, either within a group of these eleven contributors or by a combination of one or more contributors and one of the editing team. As the book began with a duologue between Walsh and Stepney initiating this conversation, it ends with commentary by Stepney and Walsh on each of the presentations and their contribution to both narrative and complexity theory and with a conclusion, affirmative about the openings for dialogue but hardheaded about the limits to a mutual understanding of these disparate modes of inquiry.The individual position papers varied a great deal both in subject matter and persuasiveness. Marco Bernini's essay “Narrative and Cognitive Modeling: Insights from Beckett Exploring Mind's Complexity” spent twelve pages talking about Beckett and cognitive processes before taking its first deep dive into Beckett's writing, attempting to demonstrate from three passages how mental “global activity generates a narrative self” and it is only the final analysis of a passage from “Company” (NC 247–48) that truly lived up to the promises earlier made. Romana Turina's “Narrative Experiences of History and Complex Systems” argued, with no resistance from this reader, that social/political history—the events rather than the narrative that gets written about them—is a complex system with multiple levels and thousands of agents contributing to social change, while the historiographical narrative necessarily limits by its perspective what it can explain. Turina proposes to defeat that limitation by using a simulation game to model history, but her examples of simulation games (Monopoly and Sim City) seemed oblique to the topic when there are so many historical simulation games available today (e.g., the Civilization series or Anno 1602).Maria Poulaki's “Emergent Causality in Complex Films and Complex Systems” puzzled me because I could not find what complexity scientists mean by emergence in the “complex films” that she cited. Her essay primarily instantiates what film scholar David Bordwell characterizes as “network narratives” like Iñárritu's Babel (2006), in which three or four separate storylines on several continents are connected primarily by chance events (Bordwell). What “emerges” perhaps for the viewer is a theme that connects the plotlines, perhaps an attitude toward globalization. (Bordwell himself on his blog suggests that Babel is actually all about “how prosperous white people have to suffer because Asian, Mexican, and North African men have guns.”) In any case, a theme is an overarching generalization that rides at a higher level than the individual macro narrative lines, rather than at the hard-to-narrate micro level that underlies them. Although we may be tempted to think of the network narrative as a contemporary form of film, specific to our moment, the network film genre goes back to classics like Grand Hotel (1932) and Dinner at Eight (1933). And network plots in print novels go back even further, to Victorian baggy monsters like Dickens's Bleak House (1853), and indeed to the eighteenth-century “it-narratives” like Johnstone's Adventures of a Guinea (1760).These position papers were all written by scholars and theorists of narrative. I found the work of some of the complexity scientists satisfying, though it was often far over my head on a technical level. James Bown and Alexei Goltzov's “Narratives for Drug Design” was a frighteningly erudite essay about cancer as a complex adaptive system in which a tumor inveigles its way into the body's metabolic pathways and thrives at the expense of the organism. Drugs created to target a single biochemical pathway, to deprive the tumor of the ability to grow or metastasize, may fail because the cancer adapts. But a combination of drugs targeting different pathways at the same time may overwhelm the cancer's ability to adapt and, thus, may lead to remission or cure. The difficulty is to get oncologists to understand how this works—in effect, the doctors do not get the narrative. Bown and Goltzov discuss a computer system they have invented for visualizing the metabolic feedback loops and what happens when one interferes with them, successively or simultaneously. This program enables doctors to understand the “narrative” of the various treatment possibilities.The longest of the essays by complexity scientists was “(Gardening) Gardening: A Relational Framework for Complex Thinking about Complex Systems” by Leo Caves and Ana Teixeira de Melo. Here, gardening is used as a model for what happens when an individual (the gardener)—possessed of either pragmatic or theoretical knowledge—intervenes in a complex system (the garden) located in an environment that is itself complex. This rewarding essay went through many variables and fleshed out more concretely how their model—actually a meta-model—could be used to demonstrate the features of a complex system, such as the interaction of components, feedback between levels, and emergent behavior. Perhaps the most stimulating of the essays for me, though, was Adam Lively's “Closure, Observation and Coupling: On Narrative and Autopoiesis,” with its reliance on German sociologist Niklas Luhmann's approach to complex systems, quite different than the cybernetic version primarily used in Narrating Complexity. Lively's hints sent me off hungrily to read Luhmann's Art as a Social System (2000), with which I am still coming to terms.If Narrating Complexity is a book curated by its editors far more strictly than comparable collections, Narrative Complexity: Cognition, Embodiment, Emergence was just the reverse. The editors' introduction gives a scanty idea of what the volume's contents will be and how they were chosen. While the relation between narrative theory and complexity science was the ostensible connection between the essays, few of the essays gave more than lip service to this issue, and I had the occasional feeling that contributors were urged to insert words like “complexity” or “emergence” somewhere in their chapter. The readers of Style may be pleased with how much contemporary literature figures here, particularly at its nontraditional frontiers, and in about half of the essays, there was more to be enjoyed than endured. The individual contributions are marshaled in four sections: narrative in new media, cognition and comprehension, narrative in the body, and evolution and emergence.The first essay, Marie-Laure Ryan's “Narrative as/and Complex System/s,” leading off the new media section, begins with a clear, brief summary of complexity theory, then settles down to a provocative discussion of two aspects of narrative, decentralized control and emergence, which can be seen as analogous to the features of complex systems. Ryan's arguments are persuasive because she always remains aware that her issues are inspired by complexity science and imported metaphorically into a very different milieu, since no matter how decentralized a plot might be, it was centrally generated by an author, and no matter how surprising a video game simulation may be to the players, its possibilities are always limited by the underlying digital program.The presence of “The Sims” in Ryan was the new media connection: subsequent essays in this section explored a good many texts about which we will have to take the authors' word since they are not readily accessible: a digital novelette (“Pry”), “locative narratives” (digital feeds that can be accessed only at a particular GPS location), “digital interactive narratives,” and “informative autobiographies.” This last phrase refers to the multiple ephemeral interactions with disparate internet sites that today allow us to talk about what we are doing, express opinions, and write on web pages—material that, in earlier generations, would be inscribed in a journal or letters and saved for handwritten or printed autobiographical life writing. It is a potentially interesting question: how will our ubiquitous data posting affect the production of biographies and autobiographies? But it is not one the essay's author, Ulrik Ekman, is interested in answering; he prefers to theorize about theories: “Narratology may well improve its notion of structural emergence by integrating existing enactive and embodied approaches to engage in a more functionally complex manner with contemporary everyday cultural autobiographical thought, practices, and experiences” (NCCEE 132).The essays in the section on cognition and comprehension were consistently interesting. There was a fascinating article by Magliano, Higgs, and Clinton detailing experimentation using fMRI on how the brain processes visual narratives. The high point for me, though, was Neil Cohn's “Structural Complexity in Visual Narrative.” Cohn qualifies Scott McCloud's theory that there is a universal grammar to comics based on the gaps between successive frames and the inferences we make from those gaps; he also shows convincingly the interesting ways in which the “visual narrative grammar” of Japanese manga differs from that of American superhero comics.The section on narration and the body was often heavily jargon-bound. The exception was Martin Rosenberg's “Jazz as Narrative,” about the incredible abilities of jazz musicians to improvise solos in the moment that incorporate responses to what the other members of the combo are doing. We might think this involves planning, but it appears from fMRI experiments that, during improvisation, those areas of the brain associated with executive function and goal-directed behavior are deactivated, in favor of areas that are otherwise associated with the spontaneous production of narrative. Rosenberg, at one point, suggests that “a jazz ensemble itself may indeed behave like a neuronal ensemble… comparable to the feedback behaviors of neuronal ensembles found within an individual brain” (NCCEE 350–51).The last section, on narrative and evolution, had two fine essays. James Carney's “Necessary Fictions” sidesteps the vexed question of whether the ability to tell and understand narratives has a primary adaptive function, as Brian Boyd and Joseph Carroll have argued. Carney instead considers it an “exaptation that emerges as a side-effect of traits selected for very different reasons” (NCCEE 393). The two aspects of readerly engagement Carney considers in this evolutionary context are what he calls “supernormal cues” (representations of threats to be avoided or attractions to be pursued) and “cognitive loading” (the mental effort required to complete a task). Carney cites experiments showing that supernormal cues get our attention quickly but fade quickly as well; moderate cognitive loading engages the mind for the long term. Both traits would have been selected for in our prehistory, and we are stuck with them today. They may even be responsible, not merely for our addiction to narrative, but for changes in literary taste: “What counts as effortful cognition can vary hugely with level of education, cultural diversity, and historical distance. This means that the distinction between high and low cultural forms can often be porous. The result is the changing pattern of valuation that the record evinces. It is clear, for instance, that the passage of time makes genres that once imposed little to no cognitive load opaque to later audiences. This gain in cognitive load increases the intellectual salience of a representation— and thus it is that folktales, medieval mystery plays, the low comedy of the opera buffa, the imperial romance, and the sensation fiction of the 1800s are now important targets of cultural elaboration” (NCCEE 406).The final chapter, completely unexpected in both subject and treatment, was an allusively learned and elegant essay by Jose Angel Garcia Landa titled “In Hindsight.” His argument is that “narrative is not a mere behavioral quirk, the latest trick of a clothed ape…. [It is] tightly interwoven with the order of the world—a deeper relationship than meets the eye…. I mean by this that the perception of physical, noninstitutional, nonhuman reality provides the foundation for such basic narrative dimensions as sequentiality, causality, or transformations. Call this protonarrative grounding ‘Time,’ for short; call it universal Evolution, or Becoming—its complexity eludes the scope of this paper, and it is the kind of complexity that (by definition) we can fully grasp only through the instruments of human cognition: language, myth, logic, philosophy, science, metaphor—and narrative” (NCCEE 416). Garcia Landa goes on to meditate on the evolutionary history we have traced since the beginning of time at the Big Bang, the emergence of the universe from chaos, followed by the emergence of our ecological earth, and of life forms leading, contingently, to the emergence of homo narrans and narrative itself, with its way of understanding history in both senses: the facts that have supervened and the stories that we tell about those facts. I closed Narrative Complexity wishing that all theoretical essays could be as beautifully written and as insightfully original as this one.",W4234287237,True,0.9368080496788025

In fact, the halls of the David L. Lawrence Convention Center (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvnia) echoed disapproval of biofuels this past August from some ecologists who cite scenarios of land use change and greenhouse gas emissions associated with first-generation grain-based biofuels, but are less aware of recent advances toward cellulosic fuel sources. The ecological benefits of biofuels have been debated in scientific literature, but there is much new information that suggests there are gains in ecosystem services that can be made with second-generation cellulosic feedstock crops. The population that made their way to this session were exposed to some of the most recent findings in biofuels research, beyond the first-generation perspective. The emphasis in biofuels research has indeed shifted to second-generation lignocellulosic crops (Somerville et al. 2010) because of the reduced environmental impacts relative to first-generation annual grain crops. Dr. Elya Gelfand (1) presented yet another line of evidence for the negative impacts associated with converting land to intensely managed annual grain crops. Gelfand measured terrestrial greenhouse gas (GHG) balances, using both static chambers and eddy covariance, to calculate the carbon debt associated with converting grasslands managed under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to continuous corn or corn–soybean agriculture. After conversion from CRP grassland, which formerly was a net sink of GHG, Gelfand estimated that the carbon debt was unlikely to be repaid if conventional corn–soybean agriculture were established on the same land. If no-till management were used with corn–soybean, the debt might be repaid after 18 years. These results support those previously published by others (e.g., Shapouri et al. 2003, Pimental and Patzek 2005) and underscore the importance of prioritizing research on second-generation biofuel crops. The majority of the presentations focused on second-generation cellulosic feedstocks, covering topics that ranged from the microbial communities that mediate nutrient cycling of perennial feedstock crops to the biofuel-related policies that affect forest carbon cycling. Four of the scheduled speakers presented research funded by the Energy Biosciences Institute (EBI) at the University of Illinois. EBI is the home institute for the session organizers, but it is also a leader in the field of biofuels research, housing scientists of many disciplines that collectively study the full production chain for bioenergy. Other speakers represented institutions across the United States, including the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center, another leader in bioenergy research, Michigan State University, Iowa State University, University of New Hampshire, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the Environmental Protection Agency. The session began with Dr. Marcelo Zeri (2) introducing the field experimental design that has been established by EBI in Urbana, Illinois, to resolve the carbon, nitrogen, and water biogeochemical cycles of alternative bioenergy agro-ecosystems. A replicated block design with side-by-side field trials of corn–corn–soybean rotation agriculture, high-diversity prairie communities, switchgrass, and miscanthus plots has been established (Fig. 1); each treatment is fully instrumented with separate eddy covariance towers, micro-meteorological stations, automated chambers to measure CO2 fluxes, N2O flux chambers, soil moisture and temperature probes, minirhizotron tubes, and separate tile drainage systems. The project represents the first large-scale and relatively long-term (10 years) experiment to test four bioenergy cropping systems under identical conditions. Established in 2008, data from the plots are still preliminary because the perennial grasses require three years to attain mature crop yields, but Zeri demonstrated the extensive data sets that are being compiled to account for water, C, and N cycling continuously in each cropping system. Energy Farm at the University of Illinois (Urbana, Illinois, USA) in October of 2010 after corn and soybean harvests (photo taken by Tim Mies, Energy Biosciences Institute). Beyond site-level GHG fluxes of bioenergy agro-ecosystems, there are also GHG fluxes associated with land use change that are caused by introducing new cropping systems. There is much uncertainty associated with estimates of land use change caused by biofuel crops and debates about indirect land use change especially persist in scientific literature. Dr. Kristina Anderson-Teixeira (3) introduced a concise method for calculating the GHG value of ecosystems (Anderson-Teixeira et al. 2010), an approach that could be used as a standard for estimating the impact of land conversion on climate change. Anderson-Teixeira asserts that GHG accounting should include direct fluxes, fluxes offset by the ecosystem replaced in a land use change event, and radiative forcing associated with all gas fluxes, as well as the physical properties of an ecosystem canopy. Estimates of GHG fluxes resulting from land use change will always be subject to the uncertainty in data that characterize the change. Nevertheless, standardized methods for quantification of GHG fluxes provide guidelines for measurements that are needed to resolve effects of land use change. Other speakers associated with EBI described studies on the invasiveness of miscanthus and microbial communities that mediate nutrient cycling in perennial bioenergy crops. Dr. Lauren Quinn (4) observed that traits favorable for bioenergy crops (rapid growth, pathogen resistance, high nutrient use efficiency, etc.) are also traits that are common to invasive species. Quinn introduced the invasive characteristics of Miscanthus sinensis, which has been classified as invasive in several states of the United States (USDA 2010). M. sinensis is a close relative of the sterile hybrid Miscanthus × giganteus, which has been introduced as a biofuel crop with great potential due to its high yields and low input requirements. Although M. sinensis has greater cold and drought tolerances that could be advantageous for crop success in northern sites, Quinn's results demonstrate that there would be a greater risk of invasion associated with plantations of M. sinensis relative to the sterile and self-incompatible hybrid Miscanthus × giganteus (Quinn et al. 2010). One of the perceived beneficial traits of Miscanthus × giganteus as a bioenergy feedstock is the unique microbial community associated with this crop that includes nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Davis et al. 2010), as described by Dr. Angela Kent (5). There have been an increasing number of studies that document endophytic and free-living bacteria that fix nitrogen in perennial grass species. Kent's recent work contrasts the microbial communities associated with Miscanthus spp. at different sites, both in native habitats (in Japan) and in Miscanthus agro-ecosystems in the United States. Diazotroph populations were similar among native and cultivated Miscanthus varieties, but assemblages were unique relative to other perennial grasses (e.g., switchgrass). Nitrogen-fixing bacteria were most abundant in warmer, wetter sites than in colder, drier sites. These results are indicative of the geographic variance that may exist in the sustainability of biofuel agro-ecosystems. A limitation to cultivating Miscanthus × giganteus is the need to propagate by rhizomes, as it is a sterile hybrid that does not produce seed. Rhizome planting requires wider spacing that results in less uniform coverage during establishment than seeded grasses, and therefore necessitates greater herbicide use for weed control. Dr. Emily Heaton (6) tested the hypothesis that nurse crops would increase the success of establishment and reduce the ecological impact associated with herbicide treatments. Heaton found that the benefits of this practice include soil protection, but there is a trade-off in yield losses. M. × giganteus appears to be affected by competition from the intended nurse crops. These results are a contribution to accumulating data that will eventually define best management practices for perennial biofuel crops. An emerging area of biofuel research that requires the engagement of ecologists to properly address policies and educate policy-makers is forest biomass removal. Dr. Steven Hamburg (7) presented an analysis of carbon emissions associated with harvesting biomass from forests in New England. Hamburg theorized that forests eventually reach carbon saturation, and that harvesting biomass can have lower emissions than fossil fuel burning after that point. The time required to reach carbon saturation and the subsequent break-even point with fossil fuel emissions is site specific. Hamburg also asserted that residue removal from forests already harvested for timber is a carbon-neutral source of biomass, because the residues in New England timberlands decompose quickly, releasing carbon back to the atmosphere. Matt Vadeboncoeur (8) continued the analysis of effects of biomass removal on forests by questioning the timing of nutrient limitation in harvested forests. His on-going research involves measuring macronutrient availability of forests that are subject to different frequencies and intensities of harvest. Ultimately, Vadeboncoeur's research should facilitate the identification of sustainable harvesting practices for hardwood forest in New England. The variation in biogeochemistry across sites prevents absolute estimates of sustainable harvesting, but policies are nevertheless being established to incentivize biomass removal from forests. The session concluded with research from Dr. Caroline Ridley (9) that analyzed the recent surge of scientific literature addressing biofuels. Ripley found there has been an exponential increase in the number of publications about biofuels in the last decade, with ~1500 expected in 2010. Despite the unprecedented research interest, there are key areas of research that are lacking. Most notably for the ecological community, there is a dearth of literature that addresses biodiversity responses to biofuel production. Clearly, the scientific debate about effects of land use change (e.g., Searchinger et al. 2008, Plevin et al. 2010) has implications for biodiversity, but there has been greater attention given to the effects of land conversion on GHG fluxes. To synthesize the diverse research that was represented in the topical session on biofuels, there are three emergent messages for ecologists. First-generation biofuels that use intensive conventional management practices have ecological costs that outweigh the benefits. Second-generation biofuel crops that are high yielding with low input requirements offer the ecological benefits of increased terrestrial carbon sequestration and reduced GHG emissions, but the land that is used to cultivate cellulosic feedstocks must be chosen carefully to reduce the risk of negative impacts. And finally, ecosystem research that characterizes spatial variance in biogeochemistry, biodiversity, and resilience has an important role for informing policies that incentivize biomass harvest for energy. Ecologists who are not directly engaged in bioenergy research will probably find it difficult to stay informed about all advances in the field because of the increasing volume of scientific discovery in energy biosciences. Regardless of the difficulty, the mission of ESA, as referenced in the introduction, is a call to “ensure the appropriate use of ecological science in environmental decision making,” and energy-related policies are some of the most important for ecological sustainability. The effects of emerging bioenergy production systems are not simple, and the science of ecology is a necessity in this research field. In the midst of ongoing debates about biofuels in both science and policy, opportunities for reversing the ecological impacts of fossil fuel consumption exist, and should not be overlooked.",W1993387026,True,0.9920781850814819
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4574,Introduction: Honoring the contribution of Charles H. Peterson (1946–2020) to the field of marine ecology,"Ecological science addresses a wide variety of research questions, ranging from purely academic to narrowly applied. Major advances in ecology have occurred when fundamental ecological theories were used to formulate questions designed to address pressing practical problems, especially the impacts of human activities in natural ecosystems (e.g., Murdoch, 1994; Tilman et al., 2002; Vitousek et al., 1997). Marine ecologists have played an especially important role in assessing the ecological impacts of anthropogenic disturbances, as well as enhancing our capacity to conserve, manage, and restore marine ecosystems (e.g., Bertness et al., 2014; Jackson et al., 2001; Schmitt & Osenberg, 1996). Charles H. “Pete” Peterson (1946–2020) was a trailblazer and leader in testing, developing, and, most importantly, applying ecological theory to meet environmental challenges (Figure 1). In doing so, he made substantial contributions to ecological science and scholarship. At a time when few academic ecologists wanted to conduct applied studies, Pete performed those studies at a high level of rigor and demonstrated how ecology could be advanced through the application of theory. Pete's rigorous approach to study design, statistical analysis, and interpretation of results showed the flaws in often biased approaches that were being advanced by industry scientists. Pete passed away on October 24, 2020, at his home in Pine Knoll Shores, NC, USA. To help honor Pete's important contributions to ecology we have assembled this Special Feature of Ecosphere in which we present an impressive set of papers that report new results in applied marine ecological science that were inspired by Pete's research, teaching, and mentorship. Inspection of the history of natural science indicates that marine community ecology emerged primarily with the intent to address marine resource management challenges, initially the trophic links between marine benthic invertebrate communities and exploited demersal fish populations in northern Europe (Petersen, 1914). A deeper appreciation of that history reveals how local ecological knowledge helped Pacific Island people manage nearshore marine fisheries sustainably for over a millennium (Johannes, 1981). Yet, as recently as the 1980s, researchers working in applied marine ecology were too often labeled as industry consultants, as nonacademics. Judging from the poor quality of some applied work, the criticism was warranted. Criticism of applied ecology overlapped with a major reexamination, a critique, of ecology captured by Peters (1991). This intradisciplinary assessment followed a transition, led by Professors Joseph Connell (1961) and Robert Paine (1966), in which a qualitative natural-history-based approach, heavily reliant on correlative relationships between community patterns and environmental conditions, evolved to a more theory-driven, mechanistic, and experiment-based form of ecology (e.g., Peterson, 1982). Peters' critique in 1991 initiated the expansion of ecological synthesis science as a means to broaden the generality of research questions and seek answers to the toughest problems we face, including global-scale extinctions, habitat loss, and climate change. Out of these transformative periods emerged a greater appreciation for well-executed applied ecology. Pete Peterson was a leader in this renaissance, especially in the marine environment (e.g., Christensen et al., 1996; Lubchenco et al., 1991). Pete was an exceptionally creative and productive scientist, who made key contributions to many aspects, or subdisciplines, in ecology and marine science. He was highly interdisciplinary in his thinking and general methodological approach. Pete obtained a BA in Biology at Princeton University in 1968 before receiving an MS in Zoology (1970) and a PhD in Biology (1972) working with Professor Connell at the University of California, Santa Barbara. After a brief stint at the University of Maryland (Baltimore County), Pete moved to The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he taught, advised, and conducted research until he retired in 2019. Over the past half-century, Pete fundamentally transformed our understanding of marine ecosystems while also applying his research to solving environmental problems. He published over 200 peer-reviewed papers, and his research contributed conceptually to ecology, marine biology, environmental sciences, fisheries ecology, restoration ecology, and conservation biology. Trained as a benthic ecologist, Pete used coastal soft-sediment habitats as models to explore how key ecological processes such as competition, recruitment, and predation structure communities. He studied benthic boundary layer systems and fluid dynamics, at small and large spatial scales, to disentangle complex physical–biological processes. Pete examined how habitat created by seagrass beds, salt marshes, oyster reefs, beaches, deep-sea hydrothermal vent organisms, and Antarctic crustaceans influences marine communities and produces ecosystem services. Pete's research advanced basic ecological science, but some of his most profound contributions were in applied marine and fisheries ecology, a field he was influential in establishing. In the latter stages of his career, Pete's work touched on almost every aspect of marine conservation and restoration ecology. He recognized, long before many others, that fishing caused a plethora of ecological disturbances and worked tirelessly to develop sustainable fishing practices and management strategies (Botsford et al., 1997; Jackson et al., 2001; Lotze et al., 2006; Myers et al., 2007; Peterson et al., 1987, 2000, 2003a). He highlighted that oil spilled in coastal marine ecosystems triggers cascades of long-lasting ecological effects (Peterson et al., 2003b). Pete's exceptional capacity to integrate and synthesize ideas across disciplines led to his recognizing that restoring molluscan populations decimated by red tides in coastal North Carolina was critical to local fishers while also providing novel insights into population connectivity and recruitment limitation (Peterson et al., 1996). His work on oyster reef management and restoration ignited a major research emphasis that is now global in scale (Beck et al., 2011; Lenihan & Peterson, 1998). His many contributions to marine conservation were widely recognized and awarded, resulting in a Pew Fellowship and several prizes. Pete spent a large proportion of his career actively shaping policy and engaging in management on a range of environmental issues. He interacted well with politicians, water people, managers, program administrators, and the lay public. Pete served on numerous international and national advisory committees, including ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea), GLOBEC (Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics), NSF (National Science Foundation), and NCEAS (National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis). He was equally proud of his work on the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission, just one of the several environmental commissions in the state that Pete served on over the past several decades. North Carolina's coastal habitats and resources are more resilient thanks to Pete's tireless efforts and dedication. Above all, Pete was an educator, mentor, and naturalist. His ability to articulate difficult concepts in the classroom and in the field coupled with his enthusiasm for teaching inspired and enabled many to pursue careers in marine ecology. His passion for nature, whether fishing, birding, or walking with his friends and students, was immense and provided purpose for his scholarly pursuits. He especially liked his daily swims in North Carolinas' Bogue Sound. While rigorous, demanding, and often intense in his mentorship, Pete was always a strong advocate for his students and colleagues. Pete leaves behind a large network of former students, postdocs, and colleagues whose careers he helped shape. Many of those students, postdocs, and colleagues collaborated on this Special Feature that presents 16 papers encompassing a wide spectrum of applied marine ecological research inspired by Pete's examples. These papers are dedicated to the important legacy that Pete built over a long, very productive, and impactful career. Our Special Feature presents papers that report new and exciting results from a suite of important research topics that Pete helped to develop and promote, often with seminal and high-impact publications. Four papers focus on the ecological implications and impacts of anthropogenic disturbance in coastal ecosystems. Swinea and Fodrie (2021) examine the role sustainable fisheries play in the recovery of coastal human societies from catastrophic disturbance, in this case, the massive Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Fegley and Michel (2021) advance the way we should quantify the loss and recovery of ecosystem services on beaches degraded by oil spills. Pete played a big role in advancing beach ecology, a fact articulated by Emery et al. (2022), who report on how tides drive cyclical patterns of habitat partitioning by beach invertebrate species. Finally, Donaher et al. (2021) examine how facilitation by bivalves mediates the recovery of seagrass beds from disturbance. Another set of papers examines the role of seagrass as a coastal foundation species, but with a focus on trophic interactions, especially top-down effects on community dynamics. Namba and Nakaoka (2021) examine the influence of environmental conditions on the top-down control of eelgrass populations by herbivores in coastal Japan. Wong and Dowd (2021) explore how the functional traits of component species determine the level of secondary production in eelgrass communities. Alternatively, Geraldi et al. (2022) examine the effects of top-down control on foundation species, in this case the influence of predation on oyster abundance on subtidal oyster reefs. Pete was one of the first researchers to consider the role of landscape processes in driving marine population and community dynamics. To celebrate that research, Van Hoeck et al. (2021) develop a new technique to improve coastal management, specifically the population enhancement of target species, a model system that Pete often used to test both basic ecological theory and as a means to improve management outcomes. Linking land to sea, Gehman et al. (2021) uncover the influence that land use patterns have on estuarine ecosystems by modifying parasite–host interactions. Geissinger et al. (2022) introduce the use of stable isotopes as a technique to examine patterns of habitat use by the little-known, burrowing wrymouth that inhabit nearshore soft-sediment habitats along the US Pacific and Atlantic coasts. A final set of papers helps to advance restoration ecology, a topic of great interest and importance to Pete. Butler et al. (2021) reveal the role sponges play in helping to facilitate coral restoration. Grabowski et al. (2022) and Powers and Grabowski (2023) revisit and extend our understanding of the role that habitat structure, location, and hydrodynamics play in successful oyster restoration efforts. Paxton et al. (2022) provide a framework for better incorporating ecological principles, adaptive management, and experiments in the siting, design, construction, and evaluation of artificial reefs in the coastal ocean. To wrap up the Special Feature, Smith et al. (2022) and Lenihan et al. (2022) report on the ecological impacts of fishing and the use of marine reserves and collaborative fishery research in recovering, restoring, and managing coastal marine fisheries. In summary, the papers in our Special Feature represent a great tribute to the legacy of Charles H. Peterson and are research contributions that would have made him proud.",W4382725794,True,0.9720099568367004
