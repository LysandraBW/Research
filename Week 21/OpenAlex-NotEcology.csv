Apparent competition is an indirect interaction among prey species mediated by a shared predator, and has been increasingly linked to declines of prey species across taxa. We review theoretical and empirical studies of apparent competition, with specific attention to the mechanisms of asymmetry among apparently competing prey species. Asymmetry is theoretically driven by niche overlap, species fitness traits, spatial heterogeneity and generalist predator behavior. In real‐world systems, human‐induced changes to ecosystems such as habitat alteration and introduced species may be ultimate sources of species endangerment. However, apparent competition is shown to be a proximate mechanism when resultant changes introduce or subsidize abundant primary prey for predator populations. Demonstration of apparent competition is difficult due to the indirect relationships between prey and predator species and the potential for concurrent exploitative competition or other community effects. However, general conclusions are drawn concerning the characteristics of prey and predator species likely to exhibit asymmetric apparent competition, and the options for recovering endangered species. While short‐term management may be required to avoid imminent extinction in systems demonstrating apparent competition, we propose adaptive conservation efforts directed at long‐term recovery.",W1563702561,False,0.8761112093925476

Research across diverse taxa suggest they may play important roles in population divergence and speciation. They may involve various kinds of traits, including morphological and behavioral traits and those related to life history. Many of the evolutionary, ecological, and genetic mechanisms producing and maintaining resource polymorphisms are similar among phylogenetically distinct species. Although further studies are needed, the genetic basis may be simple, in some cases under the control of a single locus, with phenotypic plasticity playing a proximate role in some taxa. Divergent selection including either directional, disruptive, or frequency-dependent selection is important in their evolution. Generally, the invasion of “open” niches or underutilized resources requiring unique trophic characters and decreased interspecific competition have promoted the evolution of resource polymorphisms. Further investigations centered on their role in speciation, especially adaptive radiation, are likely to be fruitful.",W2111382033,False,0.7324073314666748
https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2014.00036,Network complexity and species traits mediate the effects of biological invasions on dynamic food webs,"Biological invasions are a major threat to natural communities worldwide. While several species traits have been identified as important determinants of invasion success, a systematic exploration of the effects of invasions on native communities, and the role of species and community features on community robustness in the face of invasion is lacking. We present a theoretical approximation considering food web structure and species population dynamics to study the effects of invasions on complex food webs. We find that less complex (i.e. less connected) food webs are more resistant to invasions. Simulated invasions promote profound changes in several food web properties and stability measures, such as decreases in modularity and the number of food chains from basal to top species; and a decoupling of community- and population-level temporal variability. Additionally, species traits such as body size and diet breadth are strong determinants of invasion success across several trophic levels, with larger and more generalist species being more successful invaders in general. Our work complements species-centred invasion studies by adding a more holistic and systematic perspective to the study of invasions on species interaction networks.",W2001887180,False,0.8839626908302307
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00937.x,Trait‐mediated apparent competition in an intraguild predator–prey system,"Apparent competition is of broad interest due to its effects on community structure and potential applications in agriculture, restoration, and medicine. It is well‐established that apparent competition can result from changes in predator abundance or behavior caused by interactions with alternate prey, but no previous empirical study has demonstrated that apparent competition can also result from prey‐induced changes in predator morphology. This trait‐mediated alternative mechanism of apparent competition would expand the range of conditions under which apparent competition might occur in nature and identify new ways to generate or modify apparent competition in applied contexts. Here, as a proof of concept, we show that trait‐mediated apparent competition can arise from inducible offenses and show how it operates using experiments involving three ciliates. When it feeds on Colpidium kleini, the intraguild predator Tetrahymena vorax increases in size to the extent that it can then consume Paramecium aurelia, an even larger prey. When feeding only on bacteria, however, Tetrahymena remains smaller and is unable to consume Paramecium. This trait‐mediated indirect effect leads to the predatory exclusion of Paramecium, while Tetrahymena and Colpidium coexist. Developmental expansions such as those underlying the interactions observed in our study are not limited to ciliates, such as Tetrahymena, but occur among many diverse taxa and may have a surprising degree of influence over the structure and dynamics of food webs.",W2082469143,False,0.7323148250579834
https://doi.org/10.1007/s101440200014,The role of antipredator behavior in an experimental community of jumping spiders with intraguild predation,"Abstract The role of direct and indirect interactions in intraguild predation (IGP) was investigated in a laboratory study. The study system contained two spider species, Phidippus audax and Phidippus octopunctatus, and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. P. audax and P. octopunctatus eat D. melanogaster. P. audax (top predators) also eat P. octopunctatus (intermediate predators). Thus, P. audax and P. octopunctatus compete for the shared resource and also interact as predator and prey. Experiments consisted of two treatments: risk‐IGP and full‐IGP. In the risk‐IGP treatments, I examined the effects of trait‐mediated indirect effects generated by antipredator behavior of P. octopunctatus on the survival of fruit flies. P. audax chelicerae were waxed so that P. audax could not attack a prey. The result indicated a significant positive indirect effect of P. audax on the survival of D. melanogaster due to the antipredator behavior of P. octopunctatus (a trait‐mediated indirect effect). In the full‐IGP treatments, P. audax chelicerae were not restricted, so that it could attack prey; this resulted in decreased survival of D. melanogaster. Because of predation of P. audax on P. octopunctatus, even stronger positive interactions occurred between P. audax and D. melanogaster in full‐IGP than in risk‐IGP.",W1978378549,False,0.4842769205570221
https://doi.org/10.1086/657436,Keystone Predation and Plant Species Coexistence: The Role of Carnivore Hunting Mode,"Plant communities are shaped by bottom-up processes such as competition for nutrients and top-down processes such as herbivory. Although much theoretical work has studied how herbivores can mediate plant species coexistence, indirect effects caused by the carnivores that consume herbivores have been largely ignored. These carnivores can have significant indirect effects on plants by altering herbivore density (density-mediated effects) and behavior (trait-mediated effects). Carnivores that differ in traits, particularly in their hunting mode, cause different indirect effects on plants and, ultimately, different plant community compositions. We analyze a food-web model to determine how plant coexistence is affected by herbivore-consuming carnivores, contrasting those causing only density-mediated effects with those causing trait-mediated effects as well. In the latter case, herbivores can adjust their consumption of a refuge plant species. We derive a general graphical model to study the interplay of density- and trait-mediated effects. We show that carnivores eliciting both effects can sustain plant species coexistence, given intermediate intensities of behavioral adjustments. Coexistence is more likely, and more stable, if the refuge plant is competitively dominant. These results extend our understanding of carnivore indirect effects in food webs and show that behavioral effects can have major consequences on plant community structure, stressing the need for theoretical approaches that incorporate dynamical traits.",W2031823252,False,0.8257344365119934

Using a plant‐pollinator system as a model, I tested the prediction the presence of a competitor for pollination influences the strength and/or direction of pollinator‐mediated selection on floral traits. I measured phenotypic selection via female fitness on five floral traits of Ipomopsis aggregata in seven populations. Four contained only conspecifics (I only) and three also contained the competitor Castilleja linariaefolia (C + I). Directional selection via fruits/plant and conspecific pollen deposited/flower on corolla length was positive and significantly stronger in C + I populations. This difference in selection was apparently driven by interpopulation variation in the degree to which reproduction of I. aggregata was pollen limited. Consistent with expectations of interspecific competition, I. aggregata plants in C + I populations received less conspecific pollen per flower and set fewer seeds per fruit and fruits per plant than those in I only populations. Ipomopsis aggregata's corollas were also significantly longer in C + I populations, suggesting that there had been a response to a similar selective regime in past generations. Phenotypic correlations between corolla length and width, which determine the variation in I. aggregata's flower shape, were significantly weaker in C + I populations. These data suggest that competition for pollination can influence the strength of selection on and patterns of correlations among floral traits of I. aggregata. If I. aggregata populations with and without competitors for pollination are linked by gene flow, then measuring selection in competitive and noncompetitive environments maybe necessary to accurately predict how floral traits will evolve.",W2133731375,False,0.7689735889434814

We performed CYP1A2 genotype and phenotype analysis using caffeine in Ethiopians living in Ethiopia (<i>n</i> = 100) or in Sweden (<i>n</i> = 73). We sequenced the <i>CYP1A2</i> gene using genomic DNA from 12 subjects, which revealed a novel intron 1 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), –730C&gt;T. We developed SNP-specific polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism genotyping and molecular haplotyping methods for the intron 1 SNPs, and four different haplotypes were identified: <i>CYP1A2*1A</i> (wild-type for all SNPs), <i>CYP1A2*1F</i> (–164A), <i>CYP1A2*1J</i> (–740G and –164A), and <i>CYP1A2*1K</i> (–730T, –740G, and –164A), having frequencies of 39.9, 49.6, 7.5, and 3.0%, respectively. The frequency of <i>CYP1A2*1J</i> and <i>CYP1A2*1K</i> among Saudi Arabians (<i>n</i> = 136) was 5.9% and 3.6%, and among Spaniards (<i>n</i> = 117) 1.3% and 0.5%, respectively. Functional significance of the different intron 1 haplotypes was analyzed. Subjects with <i>CYP1A2*1K</i> had significantly decreased CYP1A2 activity in vivo, and reporter constructs with this haplotype had significantly less inducibility with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-<i>p</i>-dioxin in human B16A2 hepatoma cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using nuclear extracts from B16A2 cells revealed a specific DNA binding protein complex to an Ets element. Efficient competition was obtained using oligonucleotide probes carrying the wt sequence and Ets consensus probe, whereas competition was abolished using probes with the –730C&gt;T SNP alone or in combination with –740T&gt;G (<i>CYP1A2*1K</i>). The results indicate a novel polymorphism in intron 1 of importance for Ets-dependent CYP1A2 expression in vivo and inducibility of the enzyme, which might be of critical importance for determination of interindividual differences in drug metabolism and sensitivity to carcinogens activated by CYP1A2.",W2163636261,False,0.003216284327208996
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2007.01328.x,Dispersion of traits related to competitive ability in an old‐field plant community,"1 We investigated patterns in the dispersion (i.e. spread and spacing) of plant species traits that are frequently associated with competitive ability, in an old-field plant community. In contrast with previous studies, we found no evidence for significant over- or under-dispersion of maximum plant height, maximum plant biomass, or seed mass. 2 These findings hold across three plot sizes (10 × 10 cm, 30 × 30 cm, 50 × 50 cm), and when plot size is measured in terms of number of ramets (50 ramets, 250 ramets or 500 ramets) rather than per unit area. Plot size, however, significantly affected the direction of dispersion observed across test statistics, supporting previous studies that have observed that trait dispersion patterns are sensitive to plot size. 3 While no significant dispersion was detected, dispersion direction, measured as the tendency for a two-tailed test to indicate trends for a given trait, was more frequently observed when analyses were weighted by abundance. Abundance weighted analyses had significantly different dispersion directions compared with presence/absence analyses for one of three traits considered. These findings suggest that abundance weighted analyses may yield more consistent trait dispersion patterns. 4 Synthesis. Our results may be interpreted as evidence for limited, if any, functional niche partitioning between co-occurring species via size-mediated differences in rooting depth or physical space niches (i.e. limiting similarity). Alternatively, some species with large differences in competitive traits may avoid competition through niche separation, while others may simply compete asymmetrically, leading to overall patterns of dispersion that cannot be distinguished from random. This interpretation supports recent perspectives that niche and neutral theoretical concepts are not mutually exclusive; both, working together, can be applied to the interpretation of plant community assembly and structure.",W2155961701,False,0.8096230626106262
https://doi.org/10.1186/s40529-017-0183-9,Allelopathy and resource competition: the effects of Phragmites australis invasion in plant communities,"Phragmites australis, a ubiquitous wetland plant, has been considered one of the most invasive species in the world. Allelopathy appears to be one of the invasion mechanisms, however, the effects could be masked by resource competition among target plants. The difficulty of distinguishing allelopathy from resource competition among plants has hindered investigations of the role of phytotoxic allelochemicals in plant communities. This has been addressed via experiments conducted in both the greenhouse and laboratory by growing associated plants, Melaleuca ericifolia, Rumex conglomeratus, and model plant, Lactuca sativa at varying densities with the allelopathic plant, P. australis, its litter and leachate of P. australis litter. This study investigated the potential interacting influences of allelopathy and resource competition on plant growth-density relationships.In greenhouse, the root exudates mediated effects showed the strongest growth inhibition of M. ericifolia at high density whereas litter mediated results revealed increased growth at medium density treatments compared to low and high density. Again, laboratory experiments related to seed germination and seedling growth of L. sativa and R. conglomeratus exhibited phytotoxicity decreased showing positive growth as plant density increased and vice versa. Overall, the differential effects were observed among experiments but maximum individual plant biomass and some other positive effects on plant traits such as root and shoot length, chlorophyll content occurred at an intermediate density. This was attributed to the sharing of the available phytotoxin among plants at high densities which is compatible to density-dependent phytotoxicity model.The results demonstrated that plant-plant interference is the combined effect of allelopathy and resource competition with many other factors but this experimental design, target-neighbor mixed-culture in combination of plant grown at varying densities with varying level of phytotoxins, mono-culture, can successfully separate allelopathic effects from competition.",W2729547631,False,0.8414474129676819
