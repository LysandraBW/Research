Yet there is considerable debate about their nature, strength and overall importance. This debate stems in part from continued uncertainty about the ultimate mechanisms driving cascading effects. We present a synthesis of empirical evidence in support of one possible ultimate mechanism: the foraging‐predation risk trade‐offs undertaken by intermediary species. We show that simple trade‐off behaviour can lead to both positive and negative indirect effects of predators on plant resources and hence can explain considerable contingency on the nature and strength of cascading effects among systems. Thus, predicting the sign and strength of indirect effect simply requires knowledge of habitat and resource use by prey with regard to predators’ presence, habitat use and hunting mode. The synthesis allows us to postulate a hypothesis for new conceptualization of trophic cascades which is to be viewed as an ultimate trade‐off between intervening species. In this context, different predators apply different rules of engagement based on their hunting mode and habitat use. These different rules then determine whether behavioural effects persist or attenuate at the level of the food chain.",W2124528330,True,0.9890607595443726
https://doi.org/10.1890/04-1249,RESOURCE COMPETITION MODIFIES THE STRENGTH OF TRAIT-MEDIATED PREDATOR–PREY INTERACTIONS: A META-ANALYSIS,"Only a fraction of the individuals in a given prey population are likely to be killed and consumed by predators. In contrast, nearly all individuals experience the chronic effects of predation risk. When threatened by predators, prey adopt defensive tactics whose costs can lead to reduced growth, maturation rates, survivorship, fecundity, or population density. This nonconsumptive impact of predation risk on prey is known as a ""trait-mediated interaction"" (TMI) because it results from changes in prey traits such as behavior or physiology. Ecological theory suggests that the strength of TMI effects will reflect a balance between the conflicting demands of reproduction vs. predator avoidance. Competitor density and resource availability are expected to alter the balance between these conflicting forces. We conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured TMI effect size while varying competitor and/or resource density. The threat of predation had an overall negative effect on prey performance, but the strength of this effect varied with the level of competition. High competition exacerbated the negative effect of intimidation on prey density but moderated the negative effect of intimidation on prey life history and growth. We discuss these results in light of previously published theoretical expectations. Our results highlight the variable and context-dependent nature of interspecific interactions.",W2044321783,True,0.9932403564453125

To date, this work has primarily focused on the effects of predator-induced behavioral plasticity on communities. However, predator-induced morphological plasticity, which has been documented in many taxa, might also lead to trait-mediated indirect effects. Here, I examined how predators altered the behavior and morphology of larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and leopard frogs (R. pipiens) and how these phenotypic changes altered the outcome of competition between the two species. Competition in the absence of caged predators was asymmetric; when reared separately, leopard frogs grew more than wood frogs, but when competing (without predators), wood frogs grew faster than leopard frogs. The presence of caged predators reversed the outcome of competition between the two anuran prey. In the presence of larval dragonflies (Anax spp.) or caged mudminnows (Umbra limi), leopard frogs grew faster than wood frogs while total tadpole biomass production remained unchanged. Thus, there was a predator-mediated indirect effect. Because predators alter both the behavior and morphology of larval anurans and both of these traits are known to affect resource consumption and growth, both are potential mechanisms to explain the change in competitive outcome. Changes in behavior were not related to changes in growth, but changes in morphology (specifically mouth width and tail length) were related to changes in growth. When competitors were added (without predators), wood frogs increased their mouth width by 10% and their tail length by 3%, while leopard frogs increased their mouth width by 5% and did not change their tail length. The greater increase in mouth width for wood frogs should increase their forage intake, since tadpoles feed by scraping periphyton; the importance of a 3% longer tail in competitive ability is unknown. The presence of the predator threat (via chemical cues from the caged predators) reduced both the mouth width and tail length in the two prey species to pre-competition levels. This response corresponded with the reduced competitive ability of the wood frogs. This work demonstrates that both competitors and predators can alter prey morphology and suggests that changes in morphology can cause trait-mediated indirect effects.",W2134929066,True,0.9956339001655579

Furthermore, since most biological communities are not simple food chains but complex networks of interactions, one TMII within a community might easily be influenced by another TMII. In other words, TMII themselves can be cascades with potential implications for community dynamics. Here we report on one of such cascade, where a parasitic fly induces behavioral changes that disrupt a trait-mediated ant–hemipteran mutualism. We show that during parasite-induced low-activity periods, the ant Azteca instabilis fails to protect its mutualistic scale-insect partner against predatory ladybeetles. Thus, in the presence of the parasite, ladybeetles ate as many scales in ant-patrolled plants as they did in ant-free plants. These results demonstrate how, through a cascade of trait-mediated interactions, associations between members of a community can be drastically altered.",W2162163837,True,0.9337142109870911
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-9563.2008.00427.x,"Trophic promiscuity, intraguild predation and the problem of omnivores","Does anybody else miss the good old days of trophic levels? When predators, herbivores and plants knew their place and interacted in appropriate linear chains (Hairston et al., 1960; Oksanen, 1981)? We released biological control agents under the optimistic assumption that they would attack their designated prey, more or less, and at least leave organisms at other trophic levels well alone. We built management programmes and mathematical models based on this assumption (Berryman, 1992). We lived in simpler times. No longer. Omnivores, apparently, are everywhere, practicing their trophic promiscuity in complex and dynamic fashion (Rosenheim, 2007). Predators eat predators, herbivores and, incorrigibly, sometimes plants (Coll & Guershon, 2002). Food chains have become passé, replaced by reticulate webs that defy our simple notions of stability as well as all sense of propriety (Polis et al., 1989; Holt & Polis, 1997). We are face to face with the uncomfortable reality that our agents of control often eat more broadly than we would like them to. We live in the days of the omnivores. Ecologists who work in unmanaged systems have long been acquainted with the vexing issue of omnivory. Random food webs built on Lotka–Volterra predator–prey equations become less stable with omnivory (Pimm, 1982), unless the omnivorous compartments (or loops) within the webs are characterized by weak links (Neutel et al., 2007) or nonlinearities (McCann & Hastings, 1997). In other words, omnivory should be either rare or weak for systems to persist. Yet omnivory is apparently ubiquitous (Denno & Fagan, 2003; Arim & Marquet, 2004) and, judging by a casual glance at the ants alone, the links are hardly trivial (Davidson et al., 2003; Helms & Vinson, 2008; Ottonetti et al., 2008). For entomologists who work in managed systems, questions of omnivory are taking centre stage in research on agents of biological control. The compatibility of multiple control agents, interactions between native and introduced predators, damage to crops and the spread of crop pathogens are all influenced by the degree to which insects practice omnivory. We have always worried, to some degree, about nontarget effects of biological control agents, but concerns most often were for species at the same trophic level as the target of our control efforts (Simberloff & Stiling, 1996; Hawkins & Marino, 1997; Louda & Stiling, 2004; Stiling, 2004). More and more, we recognize that nontarget effects of biological control agents can emerge at multiple trophic levels (Rosenheim et al., 1995; Rosenheim, 1998) with the potential to compromise control efforts and influence associated ecosystems. High rates of omnivory may be responsible in part for the spread of exotic invasive predators and the decline of their native counterparts (Snyder et al., 2004b), with successful invaders being those species with adaptations to counter the ravages of omnivorous predators (Sato & Dixon, 2004). I have been thinking about this recently, in part because of the loss of our friend, colleague, and champion of omnivory research, Robert F. (Bob) Denno, who died last year. Others are more qualified to describe the profound and lasting influence that Bob had on the field of entomology. One of his interests in recent years was the study of omnivory, and his group helped to stimulate cutting-edge research on omnivores in natural and managed systems. This paper is not a tribute to Bob's research. Rather, his passing prompted me to think about the advances in omnivore research made during the last 5 years or so (I cheat with reference to a few important papers of finer vintage), and I present some highlights here with particular reference to managed systems. Omnivores are organisms that feed on more than one trophic level (Pimm & Lawton, 1978). Omnivores therefore include 'herbivores' that engage in cannibalism, 'predators' that suck plant juices or consume seeds or pollen and 'predators' that feed on other predators as well as herbivores (Coll & Guershon, 2002; Denno & Fagan, 2003). Most of us are familiar with ants as prototypical omnivores. Many ant species will consume animal tissue, plant exudates, phloem, seeds (or their elaiosomes) and honeydew produced by herbivorous insects (Carroll & Janzen, 1973). At least for some ant species, omnivory is not simply a response to low resource availability. For example, colonies of the invasive red imported fire ant Solenopsis invicta in the southern U.S.A. grow 50% larger in the presence of honeydew-producing insects than they do when provided with unlimited access to insect prey (Helms & Vinson, 2008). Given that honeydew is generally thought to be a lower-quality resource than animal tissue (Speight et al., 2008), there must be something about resource diversity that is important to fire ants. A subset of omnivores, known as intraguild predators (Polis et al., 1989), feed on prey items and the prey of their prey (Fig. 1). As a result, intraguild (IG) predators both eat IG prey and compete with them for resources. Intraguild predation (IGP) appears to be astonishingly common in nature, with 58–87% of species engaged in IGP interactions in the 113 food webs analysed by Arim and Marquet (2004). This is a staggering proportion of species, and a clear challenge to the notion of discrete trophic levels. According to a wide variety of models of intraguild predation (IGP), coexistence (stability) is possible only when the IG prey is a stronger competitor than the IG predator for the shared resource and only at intermediate levels of resource productivity (Holt & Polis, 1997; Borer et al., 2007). At low resource productivity, the IG predator is excluded, whereas, at high resource productivity, the IG prey is excluded. Given the apparent prevalence of IGP in nature over wide ranges of resource productivity, there must be additional coexistence mechanisms that act to stabilize IGP interactions. These might include cannibalism among predators (Rudolf, 2007), spatial or temporal refuges for the participants (Amarasekare, 2007; Janssen et al., 2007), additional density-dependent processes operating on species (Ives et al., 2005) or additional prey available to the consumers (Briggs & Borer, 2005; Holt & Huxel, 2007). A simple illustration of intraguild predation where the intraguild predator consumes the intraguild prey when competing with it for the crop pest. Pest suppression can be compromised, thus reducing crop yields. If all of the above sounds a bit abstract, consider an example. The harlequin bug Murgantia histrionica is a specialist herbivore on bladderpod Isomeris arborea in California. The eggs of the harlequin bug are parasitized by two specialist parasitoids, Trissolcus murgantiae and Ooencyrtus johnsonii (Amarasekare, 2000). Because they overlap in resource use (harlequin bug eggs) and because O. johnsonii consumes T. murgantiae (but not vice versa) when they co-occur, the system is an example of IGP; O. johnsonii is the IG predator and T. murgantiae is the IG prey. All species coexist over a broad range of resource productivity (i.e. new bug eggs per unit time) and, in this case, the interaction is apparently stabilized by a temporal refuge for the IG prey. Trissolcus murgantiae is active at cooler temperatures and has an early-season time window during which it is free from competition with, and predation by, O. johnsonii (Amarasekare, 2007). I mentioned earlier that omnivory is apparently much more common than we once thought. Why should omnivory be common in nature? Omnivores are an interesting form of dietary generalists, extending their dietary breadth beyond their own trophic level to encompass prey items at additional trophic levels. A generalist diet is considered by some to evolve in response to a trade-off between dietary quality and dietary quantity, and this same logic has been applied to the evolution of insect omnivores (Denno & Fagan, 2003). For example, if the highest-quality food source for an organism is also the most abundant, there should be no selection pressure (or ecological benefit) for a generalist diet and specialization should result (Krebs & Davies, 1993). As described in some ancient religious texts, there are no omnivores in a world awash in manna. However, as the highest-quality food source becomes increasingly diluted by more common, lower quality food, dietary breadth should increase. Denno and Fagan (2003) have suggested that omnivorous predators are supplementing their diet of low-nitrogen herbivores with higher-nitrogen predators. Omnivory, then, is seen as a strategy by which herbivore-eaters improve their lot. A complementary view might be that higher-order predators are required to incorporate lower quality herbivores into their diet because other predators are too rare as sources of food. In other words, the relative scarcity of prey with high concentrations of nitrogen in their body tissues (i.e. other arthropod predators) should result in the incorporation of herbivores (intermediate nitrogen concentrations) and plants (low nitrogen concentrations) into the diet of some predators. Omnivory is therefore favoured by the relative scarcity of food items that are good stoichiometric matches to the consumer. Of course, the evolution of omnivory is not just about stoichiometry (Matsumura et al., 2004). Diet mixing in general can dilute toxins in food, reduce the risk of predation or parasitism, and increase resistance to natural enemies (Singer & Bernays, 2003). There are evolutionary challenges to omnivory because omnivores must be able to catch, handle, digest and assimilate a broader range of prey types than their trophically-conservative relatives. We might therefore expect to see phylogenetic patterns in the evolution of omnivory and, indeed, we do. For example, within ancestrally herbivorous and ancestrally predaceous lineages of terrestrial heteropterans, seed and pollen feeding and broad host ranges are both correlated with the evolution of omnivory (Eubanks et al., 2003). In other words, existing morphological and physiological traits can pre-adapt certain groups to an omnivorous lifestyle (Coll & Guershon, 2002). Our efforts at biological control are often conceived under the assumption of simple food chains. They reflect our desire to manage trophic cascades (Paine, 1980; Carpenter et al., 1985), whereby the abundance of top predators (agents of control) determines the standing crop of primary producers (our crops of interest) (Hunter & Price, 1992; Hunter, 2001). Omnivory may dampen the effects of trophic cascades (Strong, 1992; McCann et al., 1998; Denno, 2007), reducing herbivore suppression by natural enemies and increasing plant damage (Finke & Denno, 2004, 2005). For those of us engaged in the control and management of insect pests, one question is obviously central: does the presence or introduction of multiple enemy species, including omnivores, increase or decrease pest suppression? In other words, how badly do intraguild predation and omnivory interfere with biological control? Quite often, the introduction of multiple agents of control results in the establishment of only a single dominant control agent (Denoth et al., 2002). However, when multiple control agents are naturally or artificially established, what are the consequences for pest suppression? First, consider simple models of IGP. We established above that IG predators and IG prey can sometimes coexist, through a variety of ecological mechanisms either intrinsic or extrinsic to their interactions. What does ecological theory tell us about the suppression of their shared prey: the pests of our production systems? As a reminder, we have to be careful to distinguish between pest 'production', which broadly describes the addition (birth, immigration) of new pest individuals per unit time, and the standing biomass of pests, which describes their average densities in the cropping system. Pest densities can be low, even if pest production is high, when rates of predation are also high. With that in mind, theory predicts that the IG predator should become relatively more abundant (and the IG prey relatively less abundant) as pest productivity increases (Holt & Polis, 1997). Moreover, pest density should also increase as the IG predator increases in dominance. This is exactly what occurs in the dynamics of the iconic California red scale, Aonidiella aurantii, which is parasitized by Aphytis melanus (IG predator) and Encarsia perniciosi (IG prey). As the productivity (i.e. fecundity) of red scale increases among sites, there is an increase in the relative density of the IG predator, A. melanus, and a corresponding increase in scale standing stock (density) (Borer et al., 2003). What that means for pest managers, of course, is a higher pest density as the IG predator comes to dominate the dynamics. Simply put, simple theory tells us that IGP should reduce the suppression of pests by biological control agents. However, empirical studies provide a greater range of outcomes than predicted by simple theory, and the literature includes examples of negative, neutral and positive interactions among predators that share prey resources. A recent meta-analysis has suggested that prey suppression is more often higher in diverse than in simple predator communities (Cardinale et al., 2006), although issues of omnivory were not examined directly. In a second meta-analysis focused more specifically on omnivory, mutual IGP (when predator species can consume each other) was shown to compromise pest suppression in multi-predator systems, whereas unidirectional IGP (or the absence of IGP) did not (Vance-Chalcraft et al., 2007). In other words, the strength and form of IGP in diverse predator communities appears to determine subsequent effects on pest suppression. As a gentle reminder, meta-analyses are usually aggregates of studies that report both significant positive and negative effects; the negative reports do not cease to be valid in their own right just because they are less common on average than the positive ones. Perhaps the more interesting question is why the effects of multi-predator species on pest suppression appear to be context dependent (Straub & Snyder, 2008). We are making major progress in answering this question, in part because theory on interactions among predator species is being linked to theory on relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem processes (Ives et al., 2005). We have learnt from these efforts that there exist at least four mechanisms by which predator diversity influences pest suppression. These are: (i) sampling (or lottery) effects (the presence or absence of dominant predators); (ii) resource partitioning among predators; (iii) indirect effects caused by intraguild predation; and (iv) non-additive effects among predators (Ives et al., 2005). This is a critical observation because it allows us to reconcile studies in which increasing predator diversity is associated with either higher or lower levels of pest suppression. The relative importance of the four mechanisms described above in a particular production system of interest will probably determine whether high predator diversity increases or decreases crop yield. For example, we might expect that multiple predators with strong additive or synergistic effects will increase pest suppression and increase crop yields, whereas multiple predators engaged in high levels of intraguild predation should decrease pest suppression and crop yield (Rosenheim, 1998; Sih et al., 1998; Snyder & Ives, 2003). The study by Ives et al. (2005) provides a roadmap for future research on the effects of multi-predator species on pest suppression because a series of predictions is made that should be testable in production systems. For example, their analyses suggest that the sampling effect will tend to cause a reduction in pest densities as predator diversity increases, so long as predators vary in their assimilation efficiencies or capture rates. Likewise, resource partitioning by predators among multiple species of prey will also tend to cause reductions in the average pest burden on plants as predator density increases. The latter effect of resource partitioning raises an important point: the predicted effects of predator–predator interactions on pest suppression depend upon the number of pest species within the production system. For example, if there is only one pest in the cropping system, or one that is dramatically more important to yield than all others, then IGP will probably lead to higher levels of crop damage. However, models also show that, in speciose pest communities, the total density of the entire herbivore community should still decline with increasing predator diversity when IGP is operating (Ives et al., 2005). This suggests that crops with diverse pest species may suffer less overall damage with diverse predator populations, even when those predators engage in IGP. In brief, the overall impact of IGP on pest suppression depends in part on the diversity of pests in the cropping system. It appears that any negative impacts of IGP on pest suppression may be weak in comparison to the positive effects of predator diversity in multipest systems. The apparent ubiquity of omnivory and intraguild predation (Arim & Marquet, 2004) has prompted much recent empirical work, aimed at untangling the effects of predator–predator interactions on herbivore suppression. In a series of clever experiments, Finke and Denno (2005) measured independently the effects of predator diversity and intraguild predation on herbivores and plants in a salt marsh ecosystem. They demonstrated that increasing predator diversity had little impact on herbivores and plants unless the predators engaged in intraguild predation. Under those circumstances, herbivore suppression declined and plant biomass was concomitantly reduced. Generalizing, multi-predator species appeared to be detrimental to plants when they engaged in intraguild predation. Yet some notorious IG predators can apparently participate in successful biological control. In experimental studies of pea aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum on alfalfa in the Midwestern U.S.A., suppression of pea aphids is higher (with corresponding higher alfalfa yields) with higher diversity of natural enemies (Cardinale et al., 2003). In this interesting case, the presence of generalist predators (Harmonia axyridis and Nabis sp.) causes declines in the associated cowpea aphid Aphis craccivora with the result that a key parasitoid, Aphidius ervi, focuses its prodigious powers of parasitism on pea aphids. The result is greater (non-additive) suppression of pea aphids than would be predicted from the sum of the effects of each enemy in isolation. Pest suppression occurs despite the fact that both Harmonia and Nabis are well-known omnivores, attacking other predators as well as herbivores (Snyder & Ives, 2003). What I particularly like about this study is that it includes measurements of crop yield, providing compelling evidence that growers should benefit from the presence of a diverse predator community. It also illustrates that positive indirect effects of high predator diversity can overcome simultaneous negative effects of IGP, as suggested by Ives et al. (2005). Similarly, a diverse predator assemblage can result in suppression of aphid pests, and higher crop yields, in collards Brassica oleracea (Snyder et al., 2006). In the U.S.A., collards are attacked by the green peach aphid Myzus persicae and the cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicae. In turn, these aphids are attacked by a diverse predator assemblage, including the predatory bugs Geocoris pallens and Nabis spp., the ladybird beetles Coccinella septempunctata and Hippodamia convergens, and the parasitoid wasp Diaeretiella rapae. All of these predators are actually omnivores, engaging in IGP. As a result, IGP has the potential to interfere with pest suppression and increase levels of crop damage. Nonetheless, any negative effects of IGP on pest suppression are swamped by positive effects of predator complementarity, which keep aphid numbers low and increase collard production (Snyder et al., 2006). Similar results were recently reported for potato (Straub & Snyder, 2008). Glasshouse production systems may also benefit from multi-predator introductions, even in the presence of IGP. In the U.S.A., the aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae is a significant pest of greenhouse-grown roses. It is attacked by the parasitoid Aphelinus asychis, which can also establish in greenhouses. It appears that simultaneous introduction of the parasitoid and the coccinellid beetle H. axyridis has no deleterious impact on aphid suppression by the parasitoid (Snyder et al., 2004a). Rather, control is complementary, despite the fact that the beetle consumes mummified aphids that contain parasitoid pupae (intraguild predation). Biological control is improved in the presence of the beetle because it prefers to consume unparasitized, rather than parasitized, aphids. What actions can pest managers take to reduce the probability that IGP will interfere with pest suppression under multi-predator biological control? One possibility might be to increase the heterogeneity of the cropping system. Evidence is accumulating that high habitat heterogeneity can ameliorate the negative effects of IGP on prey suppression. Structured habitats appear to provide refuges for IG prey from their IG predators, favouring the coexistence of multiple predator species (Finke & Denno, 2006; Janssen et al., 2007). For example, in salt marsh ecosystems, spiders and mirid bugs combine to attack populations of Prokelisia planthoppers on Spartina. In the presence of abundant leaf litter (thatch), predators have refuges from IGP, with the result that plant hopper populations decline and plant biomass increases (Finke & Denno, 2006). In the absence of thatch, IGP prevents the trophic cascade from operating, and planthoppers cause declines in plant biomass. In the same system, habitat heterogeneity can also act to reduce rates of cannibalism among predators, a particularly unpleasant yet widespread form of intraguild predation (Langellotto & Denno, 2006). Although habitat heterogeneity does not always result in short-term pest suppression, (Langellotto & Denno, 2004; Janssen et al., 2007)), long-term persistence of a diverse enemy pool may facilitate long-term suppression of pest populations as environments vary over time. A tentative conclusion from the discussion above might be that omnivorous predators can still promote pest suppression and higher crop yields, at least in systems with multiple pest species and high habitat heterogeneity. However, what if those predators also eat plants? Is there a place for crop-eating predators in biological control? Of course, there is a long evolutionary history of mutualism between plants and predators by which plants provide food or shelter for predators in return for predation services (Speight et al., 2008). We might therefore expect that the benefits to plants of supporting plant-feeding predators should often outweigh the costs. It turns out that many predators and parasitoids will consume plant material and still contribute to pest suppression. Zoophytophagy, the habit of consuming plant and animal tissue, is common in agroecosystems among the Heteroptera, Neuroptera, Thysanoptera, Phytoseiidae (Acarina) and Coccinellidae (Coleoptera) (Robinson et al., 2008). Zoophytophagy can be beneficial to biological control, despite plant damage, if it maintains predator populations during periods of low prey abundance (Coll & Guershon, 2002). However, if the crop plants are chemically treated or genetically transformed, plant-feeding has the potential to reduce predator populations (Moser et al., 2008). Zoophytophagous bugs in the family Heteroptera are notorious omnivores, feeding on both plant tissue and insect prey. Indeed, the availability of suitable plant species for oviposition and feeding may increase Heteropteran performance and their subsequent efficacy as agents of control (Lundgren et al., 2008). Typically, however, plants are assumed to be low-quality resources for zoophytophages, exploited largely when animal prey is at low abundance. For example, Nesidiocoris tenuis (Heteroptera: Miridae) is a zoophytophage on whitefly and tomatoes in greenhouse production systems. The occurrence of plant feeding by N. tenuis increases as its own density increases and decreases as whitefly prey become more abundant (Sanchez, 2008). Rapid decreases in N. tenuis populations after whitefly declines demonstrate that plants are poorer nutrient sources for predators than are whitefly prey. The benefits to omnivorous predators of plant-feeding may vary from simple water uptake in some systems to significant nutrient and energy gain in others (Robinson et al., 2008; Sanchez, 2008). For example, the coccinellid beetle Coleomegilla maculata is an important biological control agent of corn pests in the U.S.A. It feeds on corn pollen during larval and adult stages, with adult pollen consumption exceeding a prodigious 13 mg per beetle (Lundgren et al., 2005). Given such high potential consumption of plant resources by omnivores (Wackers et al., 2008), it should be no surprise that there are commercially available 'nutrient supplements' for use with biological control agents. However, it is important to note that their value in pest suppression is not well established (Wade et al., 2008). Whether there is a net positive or negative effect of zoophytophagy on pest suppression may depend upon environmental conditions, including pest density and the period over which pest dynamics are measured. For example, adult lacewings consume floral resources (nectar, pollen) as well as aphid prey on buckwheat in New Zealand (Robinson et al., 2008). In the presence of buckwheat flowers, lacewings consume fewer aphids each day, with an apparently negative effect of omnivory on pest suppression. However, at lower aphid densities, a propensity for flower-feeding reduces the pre-oviposition period of lacewing adults, increasing their oviposition rates (i.e. a long-term positive effect on pest suppression at the population level). This is a key point: short-term experiments tend to illustrate potential negative impacts of omnivory and IGP on pest suppression that may be more than compensated for by long-term benefits under field conditions (Ives et al., 2005; Robinson et al., 2008). As a final thought on zoophytophagy, plants engineered to express toxins might be expected to have negative impacts upon omnivorous predators, and such effects have been documented over the years subsequent to the deployment of transgenic plants. However, most effects appear to be weak. For example, the coccinellid C. maculata, and the invasive coccinellid Harmonia axyridis will feed on corn leaf tissue, even when aphid prey and water are in abundant supply (Moser et al., 2008). Given that most corn in the U.S.A. is now transformed to express Bt toxins, coccinellids might suffer from feeding on transgenic corn. Rates of larval development in C. maculata appear to decline slightly when fed on Bt corn seedlings, but the effect is not particularly strong (Moser et al., 2008). With some exceptions, then, omnivores still appear to be our friends. They add diversity to the predator pool that is available to suppress the pests of our production systems. Their pathways of consumption may be reticulate and their interactions indirect, but they can often contribute to biological control in important ways. To maximize the benefits and minimize the risks associated with using omnivores in biological control, there are several lines of future work that would be beneficial. I have already mentioned the important predictions provided by the theoretical work of Ives et al. (2005) that need to be tested. Additionally, stable isotope analyses are providing more detailed descriptions of the relative consumption by omnivores of different food sources. For example, in Tuscan olive orchards, 13C signatures demonstrate that ants gain energy from both olive-based and herb-based food webs. In the same system, different ant species vary in their use of plant-based and animal-based resources, as illustrated by their 15N signatures (Ottonetti et al., 2008). Such studies provide vital information on the energy pathways used by omnivores in production systems and appear to support the important role of habitat heterogeneity in mediating the positive impacts of omnivores in pest suppression. Moreover, as Bob Denno would have pointed out, we need to consider in much more detail how the behaviours and life histories of predators and prey influence the strength and direction of interactions in omnivorous food webs (Denno et al., 2003; Rosenheim & Corbett, 2003; Singer & Bernays, 2003). We should also continue to explore effects of omnivory on pest suppression that appear influenced by ecological contingency, particularly variation caused by seasonality, habitat structure and nutrient availability (Gratton & Denno, 2003; Denno et al., 2005). Omnivores may complicate our traditional naïve views of pest management, but there is no denying that they make life more interesting.",W2099415115,True,0.9725580215454102

Leaf pubescence has been repeatedly shown to mediate predator‐herbivore interactions whereas the influence of leaf pubescence on predator–predator interactions such as intraguild predation (IGP) has seldom been investigated. Using a three‐pronged approach we assessed the influence of leaf pubescence on the predatory mites Kampimodromus aberrans and Euseius finlandicus. Both predators occur on broad‐leaved trees in Europe. Euseius finlandicus is mostly found on trees with glabrous leaves whereas K. aberrans mainly occurs on trees with pubescent leaves. We hypothesized that leaf pubescence mediates IGP between K. aberrans and E. finlandicus and thereby determines their dominance and proportional abundance. A field survey on apple revealed that the abundance of K. aberrans and E. finlandicus is negatively correlated, with the former predominating on cultivars with strongly pubescent leaves and the latter predominating on cultivars with little pubescent or glabrous leaves. Microhabitat choice tests showed that K. aberrans preferentially resides on pubescent leaves whereas E. finlandicus preferentially resides on glabrous leaves. The effects of leaf pubescence on survival and development of immature IG predators and IG prey were reversed for K. aberrans and E. finlandicus. In the presence of the IG predator E. finlandicus, immature K. aberrans had higher survival probabilities on pubescent leaves than on glabrous ones. In contrast, the survival chances of immature E. finlandicus were higher on glabrous leaves than on pubescent ones when the IG predator K. aberrans was present. Artificial leaf pubescence enhanced IG prey capture by immature K. aberrans and prolonged their longevity but impaired IG prey capture by immature E. finlandicus and shortened their longevity. We conclude that leaf pubescence mediates IGP strength and symmetry and discuss the implications to natural and biological control.",W2021103581,True,0.9730757474899292
https://doi.org/10.1111/jzo.12127,Trait‐mediated effects between predators: ant chemical cues induce spider dispersal,"Abstract Predators can induce changes in prey phenotype such as dispersal, activity and foraging rate. Such trait‐mediated effects ( TME s) can strongly affect prey populations and generate trophic cascades, rivaling the importance of predation in communities. However, the relevance of TME on intraguild interactions has rarely been addressed. Ants and spiders are widespread generalist predators in terrestrial habitats. Ants influence arthropod assemblages and disrupt top‐down effects of spiders on herbivores by killing spiders and/or by inducing spider emigration. Here, we examined whether ants induce dispersal behaviour in spiders. We tested the effect of chemical cues of two ant species ( L asius niger, F ormica clara ) on the walking activity and the propensity for silk‐based dispersal of spiders. Silk‐based dispersal of the web‐builder P hylloneta impressa increased by 80% with exposure to L asius cues, whereas dispersal of the hunting spider X ysticus more than doubled when confronted with cues of both L asius and F ormica. In addition, X ysticus individuals showed a marked increase in walking activity when exposed to F ormica but not L asius cues. Our results show for the first time that perceived predation risk influences spider dispersal. The strong effect of ant chemical cues on spider dispersal demonstrates that TME s contribute to the impact of ants on arthropod communities.",W1512314749,True,0.9655721783638
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1218,Herbivore density mediates the indirect effect of herbivores on plants via induced resistance and apparent competition,"Abstract Herbivore‐induced plant resistance and apparent competition are two indirect ways herbivores interact. If a less damaging herbivore indirectly suppresses the abundance of a more damaging herbivore via these mechanisms, then plants may ultimately benefit. Changes in herbivore density, however, can dictate the intensity of species interactions and may play a critical role in determining the outcome of plant‐ and predator‐mediated herbivore interactions. We tested the effects of herbivore density on the strength of indirect interactions among phloem‐feeding aphids and herbivorous caterpillars and the outcome of these interactions for their shared host plant, cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum ). We quantified the survival of caterpillars on host plants that were infested with varying densities of aphids in the presence and absence of predators (ladybeetles). We found that aphids induced defensive proteins in cotton plants and that caterpillar survival was negatively affected by induced resistance. Likewise, we found that the presence of aphids increased predation of caterpillars by ladybeetles, but that apparent competition between aphids and caterpillars was density dependent. Ladybeetles consumed relatively high numbers of small caterpillars at low to intermediate aphid densities, but essentially became aphid specialists at high aphid densities. Aphid induced defenses and apparent competition combined such that plant damage by caterpillars was lowest when predators were present at low aphid density (induced resistance + highest level of apparent competition). This suggests that herbivores can benefit plants, but the effect on host plants is mediated by herbivore density. Indirect herbivore‐plant mutualisms may increase plant quality, plant fitness, and yield of crop plants and these interactions need to be considered in ecologically based pest management plans. In addition, these interactions likely alter arthropod community structure and natural selection on anti‐herbivore defense traits in plants in natural systems.",W2291488578,True,0.9058406352996826
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12317,Density‐ and trait‐mediated effects of a parasite and a predator in a tri‐trophic food web,"Summary Despite growing interest in ecological consequences of parasitism in food webs, relatively little is known about effects of parasites on long‐term population dynamics of non‐host species or about whether such effects are density or trait mediated. We studied a tri‐trophic food chain comprised of (i) a bacterial basal resource ( S erratia fonticola ), (ii) an intermediate consumer ( P aramecium caudatum ), (iii) a top predator ( D idinium nasutum ) and (iv) a parasite of the intermediate consumer ( H olospora undulata ). A fully factorial experimental manipulation of predator and parasite presence/absence was combined with analyses of population dynamics, modelling and analyses of host ( P aramecium ) morphology and behaviour. Predation and parasitism each reduced the abundance of the intermediate consumer ( P aramecium ), and parasitism indirectly reduced the abundance of the basal resource ( S erratia ). However, in combination, predation and parasitism had non‐additive effects on the abundance of the intermediate consumer, as well as on that of the basal resource. In both cases, the negative effect of parasitism seemed to be effaced by predation. Infection of the intermediate consumer reduced predator abundance. Modelling and additional experimentation revealed that this was most likely due to parasite reduction of intermediate host abundance (a density‐mediated effect), as opposed to changes in predator functional or numerical response. Parasitism altered morphological and behavioural traits, by reducing host cell length and increasing the swimming speed of cells with moderate parasite loads. Additional tests showed no significant difference in D idinium feeding rate on infected and uninfected hosts, suggesting that the combination of these modifications does not affect host vulnerability to predation. However, estimated rates of encounter with S erratia based on these modifications were higher for infected Paramecium than for uninfected P aramecium. A mixture of density‐mediated and trait‐mediated indirect effects of parasitism on non‐host species creates rich and complex possibilities for effects of parasites in food webs that should be included in assessments of possible impacts of parasite eradication or introduction.",W2054928994,True,0.9832069873809814

It focuses on two well documented responses of consumers to predation risk: decrease in consumer activity and habitat switch. These behavioral effects are transmitted to resources and they cause similar indirect effects as those which are mediated by density changes in consumers. Two indirect interactions are studied in this article: trophic cascades, and apparent competition. Results for density only, trait only and combined density and trait mediated interactions are compared and discussed with respect to manipulation with predator density (top‐down manipulation) and resource environmental capacity (bottom‐up manipulation). The article shows that trait‐mediated effects on species equilibrial densities are similar to those of density‐mediated, but they are often highly non‐linear. Thus, they may have potential for even stronger impact on food webs than those which are density mediated.",W2107288913,True,0.9639219641685486
https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/380474,Trait-Mediated Indirect Effects of Phorid Flies on Ants,"This paper provides a synthesis of the ecological impact of phorid fly parasitoids on ants. We find the most important impact of phorids on ants to be trait-mediated effects. Phorids diminish the foraging activity of ants, frequently reducing the number and average size of foragers and reducing the amount of food retrieved by a colony. However, ants' coping mechanisms include changing foraging site and time. Phorids can also affect competition, especially through changes in the ability of the host to win in exploitative competition. Factors such as microclimate, resource size, and habitat complexity interact with phorids to change their effect on competition. By being highly specific and attacking ants high in the competitive hierarchy, phorids can alter the linear nature of the competitive transitivity, and by reducing the number of foragers, they can change the discovery-dominance tradeoff that is observed in some ant communities. Trait-mediated effects of phorids also cascade to other trophic levels. As an example, we discuss the trait-mediated cascade of phorids on the Azteca instabilis system in coffee. In this system, by reducing the foraging activity of A. instabilis, phorids reduce the direct and indirect biological control impact of the ant in the coffee agroecosystem.",W2008344466,True,0.9902246594429016
https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2016.2590,Moving beyond linear food chains: trait-mediated indirect interactions in a rocky intertidal food web,"In simple, linear food chains, top predators can have positive indirect effects on basal resources by causing changes in the traits (e.g. behaviour, feeding rates) of intermediate consumers. Although less is known about trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) in more complex food webs, it has been suggested that such complexity dampens trophic cascades. We examined TMIIs between a predatory crab ( Carcinus maenas ) and two ecologically important basal resources, fucoid algae ( Ascophyllum nodosum ) and barnacles ( Semibalanus balanoides ), which are consumed by herbivorous ( Littorina littorea ) and carnivorous ( Nucella lapillus ) snails, respectively. Because crab predation risk suppresses snail feeding rates, we hypothesized that crabs would also shape direct and indirect interactions among the multiple consumers and resources. We found that the magnitude of TMIIs between the crab and each resource depended on the suite of intermediate consumers present in the food web. Carnivorous snails ( Nucella ) transmitted TMIIs between crabs and barnacles. However, crab–algae TMIIs were transmitted by both herbivorous ( Littorina ) and carnivorous ( Nucella ) snails, and these TMIIs were additive. By causing Nucella to consume fewer barnacles, crab predation risk allowed fucoids that had settled on or between barnacles to remain in the community. Hence, positive interactions between barnacles and algae caused crab–algae TMIIs to be strongest when both consumers were present. Studies of TMIIs in more realistic, reticulate food webs will be necessary for a more complete understanding of how predation risk shapes community dynamics.",W2603614123,True,0.9819585680961609

Other species gained access to baits 12 times more often and were only able to take over baits when phorids were present. Furthermore, many more species (13 versus 2) gained access to resources when phorids were present. These results indicate that phorids mediate competitive interactions between ant species and may influence ant communities by affecting resource availability.

https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12413,Using plant functional traits to restore Hawaiian rainforest,"Ecosystem restoration efforts are carried out by a variety of individuals and organizations with an equally varied set of goals, priorities, resources and time-scales. Once restoration of a degraded landscape or community is recognized as necessary, choosing which species to include in a restoration programme can be a difficult and value-laden process (Fry, Power & Manning 2013; Jones 2013). Species choice in restoration is often carried out with limited ecological information, particularly in regard to species interactions, successional processes and resource-use patterns. Selecting species can be particularly problematic in systems where there is no available baseline data on historical communities, or when restoration to a historic state is not feasible for ecological, logistic or economic reasons. In such cases, it may be preferable to focus on restoring site 'functionality' rather than returning to a historic baseline composition. We present a method for species selection in restoration, based on the collection of plant functional trait data. Using this method, managers can develop species mixtures with desired properties, including expected predictions of interspecific interactions and potential changes in biotic and abiotic conditions. To illustrate this approach, we present a case study in Hawaiian lowland wet forests (HLWF) in which plant species for a restoration project were chosen based on their functional traits, in order to help land managers achieve their restoration goals while at the same time allowing researchers to better understand invasion resistance and ecosystem functioning. In our case, our choices led to the development of hybrid ecosystems including both native and introduced species. However, the approach that we present is not limited to novel or hybrid ecosystem creation, because the candidate species examined and functional traits measured are determined by the user. Whereas restoration usually implies a return to historic conditions, there is also growing attention to what some authors have called 'intervention ecology' (sensu Hobbs et al. 2011). This view emphasizes maintaining ecosystem services and functions (Hobbs et al. 2011). The contrast between these frameworks has been widely debated in the literature, and we do not intend to advocate the merit of one view over the other here. Rather, we present the logic behind a functional trait approach, describe why its use is feasible in a Hawaiian lowland forest and present a step-by-step approach to the method that can be applied to a wide variety of ecological systems. While we readily acknowledge that in our study system, we cannot return to a pre-human state, we still consider our approach 'restoration' in a broad sense. Functional trait theory holds that characteristics or traits of each species reflect their resource use and life-history trade-offs (Reich 2014). A body of evidence shows that plant traits vary continuously, in predictable ways, along resource availability gradients – suggesting that species' functional traits can be linked to ecosystem properties and to ecosystem services (Lavorel 2013). Many studies have suggested that a robust image of a species' functional profile can be obtained by considering traits related to resource acquisition (e.g. foliar nitrogen, leaf area), resource limitation (e.g. midday leaf water potential, δ13C-integrated water-use efficiency, leaf mass per area), reproductive investment (e.g. height, seed mass, dispersal type) and resource allocation patterns (e.g. leaf mass per area, specific root length, wood density) (Drenovsky & James 2010; Douma et al. 2012; Sonnier et al. 2012; Fry, Power & Manning 2013). For restoration, selecting species with certain functional trait values can influence species interactions (including competition) and ecosystem properties (Suding et al. 2008). For example, if creating a more fire-tolerant community is necessary, practitioners could select species that increase fine-fuel loads or species whose presence will favour succession from forest to grassland. Other considerations relevant to managers include importance to local wildlife, ability to serve as nurse logs, nitrogen-fixing properties, etc. The Hawaiian archipelago offers a unique setting for testing novel approaches to applied ecological questions. On one hand, Hawai'i is considered a model system for ecological research because of the combination of well-defined biotic and abiotic gradients with extreme examples of adaptive radiation (Vitousek 2004). On the other hand, like many isolated oceanic islands, the Hawaiian Islands have been extremely vulnerable to invasion and anthropogenic disturbance. The combination of simplicity and susceptibility presents a distinctive platform for conservation research. Hawaiian lowland wet forests in particular present serious challenges for restoration and conservation. This forest type only exists as remnant patches, is always populated by invasive plant and animal species, and occurs near human habitation, where non-native propagule pressure is likely to be high (Zimmerman et al. 2008). In such ecosystems, it is important to recognize that not all non-native species are equally problematic. For example, many Polynesian introductions in Hawai'i have persisted in the landscape for up to 1000 years without becoming invasive. In addition to being culturally important, many non-invasive, non-native species have functional trait values, which are not present in the native flora. Breadfruit and coconut are two species that fit both of these criteria: they are not classified as invasive, and they have large leaves and seeds, unlike most native plants. From a restoration perspective, we aimed to test the hypothesis that designing communities with greater diversity of functional trait expression will lead to more invasion-resistant communities (Funk et al. 2008; Drenovsky & James 2010). To do so, we examined the functional traits of species using multivariate analysis; the technique projects each species to a specific x,y location in 'trait space,' which should reflect that species' functional profile. Our restoration experiment was carried out at the Keaukaha Military Reservation (KMR) within the municipality of Hilo. This site retains a HLWF, which has a canopy that contains significant numbers of native tree species; however, it also has a long history of disturbance, and invasive trees represent up to half of the basal area (Ostertag et al. 2009). A previous removal experiment in this forest has shown that removal of invasive species alone is not enough to get a native forest back, despite its positive influence on seedling recruitment of native species (Cordell et al. 2009; Ostertag et al. 2009). Given current conditions, the forest is poised to lose most of its native species and become like most of the forest patches remaining in the lowlands – almost exclusively non-native dominated. The trait-based method we used employs five steps. We illustrate the method's use in HLWF; however, it need not include the use of non-native species, and it is exportable to other ecosystems. Land managers at KMR are charged with specific targets developed by the US military. These are as follows: (i) conserving and encouraging the regeneration of native biodiversity at the site, (ii) controlling invasive species and (iii) encouraging carbon storage on the landscape. Because restoring this area to an all-native ecosystem is no longer economically feasible, we elected to create hybrid ecosystems. Our experimental communities were assembled using species whose combined functional trait profiles addressed these three management goals to meet restoration objectives of the main stakeholders. We had two main considerations for choosing the traits on which to base our species selection. First, we wanted to estimate the 'functional role' or 'strategy' (sensu Reich 2014) of different species within HLWF environments, and secondly, we wanted to identify specific traits that would address our restoration objectives. We first looked at the overall distribution of HLWF species in trait space and then focused on how different species expressed particular traits that were relevant to our restoration objectives. The functional traits measured (Table 1) were derived from literature and field data. We included traits that are informative in the ecological context of HLWF. For example, knowing that light (rather than nutrient or water availability) is the primary limiting resource for native species in this forest (Ostertag et al. 2009), we included a suite of traits related to light capture (as well as canopy and understorey architecture; including leaf : petiole ratio, plant height and canopy shape). Many of the traits we measured are informative of more than one aspect of a plant species' ecological strategy, and some traits can be used as proxies for others, which are more difficult to measure. For example, we included both maximum plant height and seed mass as proxies for dispersal distance (see Thomson et al. 2011). The potential species pool included native species thought to have been present at the site historically, native species currently found at the site and non-native species already found in the region that are believed to pose low invasion risk. To address the latter, we based our decisions on the Hawaiian Weed Risk Assessment score (Daehler et al. 2004; see In a past study at KMR, woody species richness was nine native species and 10 introduced species (Zimmerman et al. 2008). Due to a lack of formal records of species occurrence and poor pollen preservation, it is difficult to ascertain which species would have been found historically in any given area of HLWF. Because we suspect that some native species once found at KMR have been locally extirpated, we cast a wide net in order to determine which species could potentially be used for restoring the forest. We included native species with similar environmental requirements that could have occurred in HLWF, based on historical range descriptions by Wagner, Herbst & Sohmer (1999) and previous field experience. Once the list of potential species was compiled (including 17 non-native and 19 native species), we eliminated species which were too difficult to sample or propagate, and species for which sufficient data were not available – reducing our pool to 16 native species and 15 non-native species. Other limiting factors that practitioners should consider include economics (e.g. cost of seeds, plants, labour or time), logistics (e.g. availability of species, project or budget timelines), resilience to climatic change or disturbance regimes, as well as the goals and expectations of stakeholders. We sampled plant traits across the full range of conditions in which HLWF is found regionally in order to account for both site and environmental heterogeneity. In total, we sampled traits at 25 sites throughout east Hawai'i Island, in addition to using existing data from the literature. By far, the most time-consuming and effort-consuming steps in making species choices by using traits are creating the potential species pool and collecting trait data. However, compilations of trait data are increasingly common world-wide. A variety of data sets are available either directly from researchers and agencies involved in the region (e.g. the Australian Virtual Herbarium) or from collaborative data base compilations (e.g. TRY ( DRYAD ( or LEDA ( Once the trait data were assembled, we grouped the information for each trait into quartiles in order to account for both analytical constraints and the nature of trait data. Because we considered both multiple traits and multiple species, making meaningful comparisons was often challenging. For example, measures of seed mass spanned many orders of magnitude from <0·001 to 576 g, while the maximum difference in leaf thickness measured no more than 0·4 mm (Table 1). Furthermore, sometimes it is necessary to compare ratios and categories to numerical data. The use of quartiles places more importance on the relative differences in trait values. This approach emphasizes species which are 'outliers' rather than species that display the 'middle range' (i.e. the most or least effective water use vs. the species whose values are nearest to the group mean). This type of data manipulation is appropriate to the multivariate ordination analysis we later employ. We used a principal components analysis (PCA) to show how the selected species are arranged, relative to one another, in trait space and to provide an idea of each species' functional profile. Other multivariate techniques could be substituted. An important outcome of the PCA was the prominent separation of native and non-native species in distinct areas of the graph, primarily based on leaf mass per area, carbon : nitrogen ratio and foliar nitrogen (Fig. 1a). This result reinforces that species in Hawai'i with different biogeographic origins are functionally divergent. Hawaiian species tend to be conservative in regard to growth and nutrient acquisition, whereas the non-native species tend towards faster life-history strategies. Carbon turnover rates are substantially higher in invasive-dominated communities than they are in native plant communities (Hughes et al. 2014). With this in mind, we ran an additional PCA using only traits associated with carbon cycling (including specific gravity, foliar chemistry and maximum plant height) to find which species from our pool have the greatest likelihood of slow rates of carbon turnover (Fig. 1b). We identified two groups of four 'core species' whose trait profiles indicate either slow or moderate carbon turnover, and then located these core species on the first (general) PCA of all species traits (Fig. 1a). Based on Euclidian distances within the general PCA, we determined a centroid point equidistant from all four species in each group and then selected groups of additional species that were closer (i.e. most similar and potentially most redundant) and furthest (i.e. least similar and potentially most complementary) to each centroid (Fig. 1c). The motivation for this selection was that we are trying to determine whether combinations of species whose traits are more dissimilar (complementary) or similar (redundant) confer greater invasion resistance in the hybrid forests (Funk et al. 2008). Once species are displayed in trait space, a variety of decisions can be made based on their relative functional profiles. While our process included two PCAs, for some restoration objectives, decisions could be made with only one (Fig. 1a). In our case, pragmatic and logistical concerns were addressed at this point. For example, one of our species was removed, because although it was culturally important, and functionally a good fit, it is unable to maintain itself without direct, ongoing human intervention. Alternatively, when several species proved to be functionally similar, final species choice was based on pragmatic considerations such as seedling cost, availability within given time frames or projected time to maturity. In short, the process allows for an unbiased way to let the data dictate a first step, and then, the practical concerns of practitioners can be layered onto the final species choices. To date, multiple studies have evaluated the role of functional traits in ecosystems and/or been carried out in controlled settings and relatively simple ecosystems such as grasslands (Drenovsky & James 2010; Fry, Power & Manning 2013; Lavorel 2013). We show that a trait-based approach can also be used in a tropical forest system. Because the metrics are based on site-specific restoration objectives, this approach is generalizable, flexible and transferable across ecosystems and taxa. Once refined, the approach can be applied with relatively little effort by managers. We named our project Liko Nā Pilina, which translates loosely to 'the budding new relationships', to emphasize the developing associations among the species, and the intertwining of fundamental science questions and the practical needs of land managers faced with a formidable task made more daunting by lack of information on how to achieve their restoration goals. While it is too early to determine if the treatments met our objectives, results 1 year after planting show >90% survival of outplants and increased seedling recruitment by native species. By creating hybrid ecosystems using both native and non-native species (many of which are culturally significant), the project melds together traditional and contemporary approaches to forest management. This has proved attractive to the general public, school groups and summer programmes, allowing us to tap into an eager set of volunteers. In our experience, the level of community engagement is unusual for science-based restoration experiments. Thus, this new type of restoration can fulfil many goals, providing a rigorous way to choose species for restoration as well as providing a simple framework that is appealing to local communities.

The present article investigates beyond the pairwise competitive interactions and provides a novel perspective for understanding the influence of higher-order interactions on the evolution of social phenotypes. Our simple model yields a prosperous outlook to demonstrate the impact of perturbations on intransitive competitive higher-order interactions. Using a mathematical technique, we show how alone the perturbed interaction network can quickly determine the coexistence equilibrium of competing species instead of solving a large system of ordinary differential equations. It is possible to split the system into multiple feasible cluster states depending on the number of perturbations. Our analysis also reveals that the ratio between the unperturbed and perturbed species is inversely proportional to the amount of employed perturbation. Our results suggest that nonlinear dynamical systems and interaction topologies can be interplayed to comprehend species' coexistence under adverse conditions.

Phenotypic traits that consistently mediate species' responses to environmental variation (functional traits) provide a promising approach toward generalizing ecological and evolutionary patterns and thereby gaining insights into the processes generating them. In the plant functional ecology literature, most trait-based studies have focused on traits mediating either resource competition or responses to variation in the abiotic environment, while traits mediating reproductive interactions have often been neglected.Methodology. Here, I discuss the value of herkogamy, the spatial separation of male and female functions in flowers, as a functional trait in plant reproductive biology and review the evidence relevant to the hypothesis that taxa exhibiting greater herkogamy have historically experienced more reliable pollination and more outcrossed mating systems.Pivotal results. A large body of work in the field of plant reproductive biology has identified a set of nearly ubiquitous correlations between average herkogamy and features of plant mating systems, notably, autofertility (seed set in the absence of pollinators) and outcrossing rate. Herkogamy often varies extensively among populations and species, and the adaptive interpretation is that herkogamy exhibits local adaptation to the reliability of the pollination environment.Conclusions. These results underline the value of herkogamy as a functional trait representing variation in mating histories. Many important insights are likely to emerge from studies leveraging herkogamy as an easily measured proxy of plant mating systems, as already demonstrated in comparative studies and studies of reproductive interactions. Greater consideration of herkogamy and other reproductive-function traits in studies of species coexistence may provide a more complete understanding of community assembly processes.",W2896731564,True,0.989287257194519
https://doi.org/10.2307/177114,Trait-Mediated Indirect Effects in Larval Anurans: Reversing Competition with the Threat of Predation,"Ecologists recently have been focusing on the role that trait-mediated indirect effects can have on community structure and composition. To date, this work has primarily focused on the effects of predator-induced behavioral plasticity on communities. However, predator-induced morphological plasticity, which has been documented in many taxa, might also lead to trait-mediated indirect effects. Here, I examined how predators altered the behavior and morphology of larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and leopard frogs (R. pipiens) and how these phenotypic changes altered the outcome of competition between the two species. Competition in the absence of caged predators was asymmetric; when reared separately, leopard frogs grew more than wood frogs, but when competing (without predators), wood frogs grew faster than leopard frogs. The presence of caged predators reversed the outcome of competition between the two anuran prey. In the presence of larval dragonflies (Anax spp.) or caged mudminnows (Umbra limi), leopard frogs grew faster than wood frogs while total tadpole biomass production remained unchanged. Thus, there was a predator-mediated indirect effect. Because predators alter both the behavior and morphology of larval anurans and both of these traits are known to affect resource consumption and growth, both are potential mechanisms to explain the change in competitive outcome. Changes in behavior were not related to changes in growth, but changes in morphology (specifically mouth width and tail length) were related to changes in growth. When competitors were added (without predators), wood frogs increased their mouth width by 10% and their tail length by 3%, while leopard frogs increased their mouth width by 5% and did not change their tail length. The greater increase in mouth width for wood frogs should increase their forage intake, since tadpoles feed by scraping periphyton; the importance of a 3% longer tail in competitive ability is unknown. The presence of the predator threat (via chemical cues from the caged predators) reduced both the mouth width and tail length in the two prey species to pre-competition levels. This response corresponded with the reduced competitive ability of the wood frogs. This work demonstrates that both competitors and predators can alter prey morphology and suggests that changes in morphology can cause trait-mediated indirect effects.",W4205088947,True,0.9956339001655579
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2003563,Contrasting impacts of competition on ecological and social trait evolution in songbirds,"Competition between closely related species has long been viewed as a powerful selective force that drives trait diversification, thereby generating phenotypic diversity over macroevolutionary timescales. However, although the impact of interspecific competition has been documented in a handful of iconic insular radiations, most previous studies have focused on traits involved in resource use, and few have examined the role of competition across large, continental radiations. Thus, the extent to which broad-scale patterns of phenotypic diversity are shaped by competition remain largely unclear, particularly for social traits. Here, we estimate the effect of competition between interacting lineages by applying new phylogenetic models that account for such interactions to an exceptionally complete dataset of resource-use traits and social signaling traits for the entire radiation of tanagers (Aves, Thraupidae), the largest family of songbirds. We find that interspecific competition strongly influences the evolution of traits involved in resource use, with a weaker effect on plumage signals, and very little effect on song. Our results provide compelling evidence that interspecific exploitative competition contributes to ecological trait diversification among coexisting species, even in a large continental radiation. In comparison, signal traits mediating mate choice and social competition seem to diversify under different evolutionary models, including rapid diversification in the allopatric stage of speciation.",W2785617100,True,0.9780389070510864
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2564,Mistletoe generates non‐trophic and trait‐mediated indirect interactions through a shared host of herbivore consumers,"Abstract Indirect interactions emerge among a wide range of herbivores sharing the same plant resource. Consumers usually belong to different trophic guilds, from folivores and sapsuckers to parasitic plants. We propose that mistletoes parasitizing pines could play a key role acting as herbivores on host pines and coming indirectly into competition with other herbivores feeding on the same host. Changes caused by mistletoes on its host have been well studied, but its effects running across trophic webs remain unrevealed. In this study, we investigate the effect of European mistletoe ( Viscum album subsp. austriacum ) on the host‐feeding herbivores via trait‐mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) across their shared pine host ( Pinus nigra subsp. salzmannii ). We performed field and laboratory experiments, and analyzed the net effect of different mistletoe parasite loads on three host‐phytophagous species: the sapsucker Cinara pini (Aphididae), the winter folivore Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Thaumetopoeidae), and the summer folivore Brachyderes sp. (Curculionidae), all being members of different functional feeding groups (FFGs). We summarize the mistletoe–host–herbivore interactions by means of a TMII, where mistletoe parasitism causes non‐trophic links and detrimental indirect interactions on pine‐feeding herbivores across its shared host, suggesting a worsening of host quality as food. These indirect interactions vary according to three parameters. First, the intensity has a non‐proportional relation with parasite load, showing an impact threshold on highly parasitized pines. Second, the movement capacity of insect herbivores determines their response, by decreasing the abundance of herbivores with low movement ability (aphids and pine processionary caterpillars) while altering the behavior (plant selection) of more mobile herbivores (pine weevils). Finally, FFG determines the intensity of mistletoe parasitism effects, folivores being more responsive than sapsuckers. Overall, mistletoe generates non‐trophic interaction linkages in the forest able to modify community structure by becoming a nexus of the entire herbivore community of the pine canopy.",W2921991496,True,0.9836735129356384
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13378,From apparent competition to facilitation: Impacts of consumer niche construction on the coexistence and stability of consumer‐resource communities,"Abstract In addition to their direct trophic effects, some consumers have a positive indirect effect on their resource, due to niche construction. A predator can facilitate its prey resource acquisition, through prey transport, or through modifications of nutrient cycling. Alternatively, a predator may defend its prey against other predators, or actively manage it, as in agriculture, which is found in numerous taxa such as humans, ants, beetles, fishes and microbes. Here, we investigate the ecological consequences of considering such positive effects in a simple two‐resource–one‐consumer module, in which the consumer has a positive effect on one of the resources. We consider several scenarios, in which the positive effect on the resource is either not costly, that is resulting from a by‐product of the consumer phenotype such as nutrient cycling, or costly. The cost either decreases the exploitation of the cultivated resource or the opportunity to forage the alternative resource. We investigate how the intensity of niche construction impacts species coexistence, the distribution of biomass among the three species and the stability of the community. We show that by modifying the trophic interactions in the module, niche construction alters the apparent competition between the resources, thereby impacting their coexistence. When niche construction has little or no cost to the consumer, it leads to higher consumer and cultivated resource densities, while decreasing the alternative resource density. Alternatively, when niche construction has higher costs, the alternative resource can increase in density, niche construction thereby leading to the emergence of facilitative interactions among resource species.

https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.0504,Trait-mediated competition drives an ant invasion and alters functional diversity,"The assumption that differences in species' traits reflect their different niches has long influenced how ecologists infer processes from assemblage patterns. For instance, many assess the importance of environmental filtering versus classical limiting-similarity competition in driving biological invasions by examining whether invaders’ traits are similar or dissimilar to those of residents, respectively. However, mounting evidence suggests that hierarchical differences between species' trait values can distinguish their competitive abilities (e.g. for the same resource) instead of their niches. Whether such trait-mediated hierarchical competition explains invasions and structures assemblages is less explored. We integrate morphological, dietary, physiological and behavioural trait analyses to test whether environmental filtering, limiting-similarity competition or hierarchical competition explain invasions by fire ants on ant assemblages. We detect both competition mechanisms; invasion success is not only explained by limiting similarity in body size and thermal tolerance (presumably allowing the invader to exploit different niches from residents), but also by the invader's superior position in trait hierarchies reflecting competition for common trophic resources. We find that the two mechanisms generate complex assemblage-level functional diversity patterns—overdispersion in some traits, clustering in others—suggesting their effects are likely missed by analyses restricted to a few traits and composite trait diversity measures.",W4283709393,True,0.9622019529342651

Leaf pubescence has been repeatedly shown to mediate predator-herbivore interactions whereas the influence of leaf pubescence on predator–predator interactions such as intraguild predation (IGP) has seldom been investigated. Using a three-pronged approach we assessed the influence of leaf pubescence on the predatory mites Kampimodromus aberrans and Euseius finlandicus. Both predators occur on broad-leaved trees in Europe. Euseius finlandicus is mostly found on trees with glabrous leaves whereas K. aberrans mainly occurs on trees with pubescent leaves. We hypothesized that leaf pubescence mediates IGP between K. aberrans and E. finlandicus and thereby determines their dominance and proportional abundance. A field survey on apple revealed that the abundance of K. aberrans and E. finlandicus is negatively correlated, with the former predominating on cultivars with strongly pubescent leaves and the latter predominating on cultivars with little pubescent or glabrous leaves. Microhabitat choice tests showed that K. aberrans preferentially resides on pubescent leaves whereas E. finlandicus preferentially resides on glabrous leaves. The effects of leaf pubescence on survival and development of immature IG predators and IG prey were reversed for K. aberrans and E. finlandicus. In the presence of the IG predator E. finlandicus, immature K. aberrans had higher survival probabilities on pubescent leaves than on glabrous ones. In contrast, the survival chances of immature E. finlandicus were higher on glabrous leaves than on pubescent ones when the IG predator K. aberrans was present. Artificial leaf pubescence enhanced IG prey capture by immature K. aberrans and prolonged their longevity but impaired IG prey capture by immature E. finlandicus and shortened their longevity. We conclude that leaf pubescence mediates IGP strength and symmetry and discuss the implications to natural and biological control.",W4230221898,True,0.9731405973434448
https://doi.org/10.1890/04-1136,ECOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF A RESOURCE POLYMORPHISM IN ZENAIDA DOVES OF BARBADOS,"Despite the important place of resource polymorphisms in ecological and evolutionary theories, the reason why a group of individuals sharing a common environment should diverge in the use of the resources remains poorly known. Given the existence of distinct open niches and the relaxation of interspecific competition, niche theory suggests two possible mechanisms: resource competition between conspecifics and trade-offs in resource use efficiency. We investigated the importance of these explanations in a foraging polymorphism recently developed by Zenaida Doves (Zenaida aurita) on the West Indian island of Barbados. In this polymorphism, individuals either aggressively defend feeding territories from conspecifics or feed in large unaggressive groups with conspecifics. Combining field observations and a cage experiment, we found no evidence that the polymorphism is primarily driven by age- or sex-related differences, or that it results from morphological feeding specializations or dietary preferences. Instead, our results support the hypothesis that individual specializations arise from contest competition. In the study area, competition for territories was intense, with very little undefended space left between territories and owners frequently involved in territorial contests. Replacement of territory holders from year to year was low compared to the number of potential recruits, implying that many doves were incapable of securing a territory. Approximately half the doves at territorial sites did not hold a territory but wandered between them as floaters. Compared with territory holders, floaters were smaller and had shorter wings, traits that in this species mediate territory defense. Yet floaters did not differ from group feeding doves on these morphological traits. This suggests that group feeders are floaters that shift to an alternative resource. The new resource appears to be suboptimal, as indicated by the fact that group feeders were in worse body condition than doves from the territorial sites. Taken together, our results suggest that the resource polymorphism in Zenaida Doves is primarily driven by competition for territories, which forces less competitive individuals to use alternative, subobtimal resources.",W2108436819,True,0.9884876608848572
https://doi.org/10.1890/04-0719,SCARED TO DEATH? THE EFFECTS OF INTIMIDATION AND CONSUMPTION IN PREDATOR–PREY INTERACTIONS,"Predation is a central feature of ecological communities. Most theoretical and empirical studies of predation focus on the consequences of predators consuming their prey. Predators reduce prey population densities through direct consumption (a density-mediated interaction, DMI), a process that may indirectly affect the prey's resources, competitors, and other predators. However, predators can also affect prey population density by stimulating costly defensive strategies. The costs of these defensive strategies can include reduced energy income, energetic investment in defensive structures, lower mating success, increased vulnerability to other predators, or emigration. Theoretical and empirical studies confirm the existence of these induced costs (trait-mediated interactions, TMIs); however, the relative importance of intimidation (TMI) and consumption (DMI) effects remains an open question. We conducted a meta-analysis assessing the magnitude of both TMIs and DMIs in predator–prey interactions. On average, the impact of intimidation on prey demographics was at least as strong as direct consumption (63% and 51% the size of the total predator effect, respectively). This contrast is even more pronounced when we consider the cascading effects of predators on their prey's resources: density effects attenuated through food chains, while TMIs remained strong, rising to 85% of the total predator effect. Predators can thus strongly influence resource density even if they consume few prey items. Finally, intimidation was more important in aquatic than terrestrial ecosystems. Our results suggest that the costs of intimidation, traditionally ignored in predator–prey ecology, may actually be the dominant facet of trophic interactions.",W2108031508,True,0.9757604598999023
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007423,Species-Specific Traits Rather Than Resource Partitioning Mediate Diversity Effects on Resource Use,"Background The link between biodiversity and ecosystem processes has firmly been established, but the mechanisms underpinning this relationship are poorly documented. Most studies have focused on terrestrial plant systems where resource use can be difficult to quantify as species rely on a limited number of common resources. Investigating resource use at the bulk level may not always be of sufficient resolution to detect subtle differences in resource use, as species-specific nutritional niches at the biochemical level may also moderate diversity effects on resource use. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we use three co-occurring marine benthic echinoderms (Brissopsis lyrifera, Mesothuria intestinalis, Parastichopus tremulus) that feed on the same phytodetrital food source, to determine whether resource partitioning is the principal mechanism underpinning diversity effects on resource use. Specifically we investigate the use of phytodetrital pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) because many of these are essential for biological functions, including reproduction. Pigments were identified and quantified using reverse-phase high performance liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and data were analysed using a combination of extended linear regression with generalised least squares (GLS) estimation and standard multivariate techniques. Our analyses reveal no species-specific selectivity for particular algal pigments, confirming that these three species do not partition food resources at the biochemical level. Nevertheless, we demonstrate increased total resource use in diverse treatments as a result of selection effects and the dominance of one species (B. lyrifera). Conclusion Overall, we found no evidence for resource partitioning at the biochemical level, as pigment composition was similar between individuals, which is likely due to plentiful food availability. Reduced intra-specific competition in the species mixture combined with greater adsorption efficiency and differences in feeding behaviour likely explain the dominant use of resources by B. lyrifera.",W2010454319,True,0.9644992351531982

When predation levels are high, this apparent competition can culminate in a prey species being displaced. Coupling quantitative genetics and Lotka-Volterra models, we study how predator evolution alters this and other ecological outcomes. These models account for a trade-off between the predator's attack rates on two prey species. We provide a mathematical characterization of a strong form of persistence--permanence--for which there is a global attractor bounded away from extinction. When the evolutionary dynamics occur at a sufficiently slower time scale than the ecological dynamics, we also characterize attractors and their basins' of attraction using singular perturbation theory and a graphical approach to the eco-evolutionary dynamics. Our results show that eco-evolutionary feedbacks can mediate permanence at intermediate trade-offs in the attack rates. However, at strong trade-offs, permanence is lost. Despite this loss of permanence, there can be attractors supporting coexistence. These attractors, however, may coincide with attractors at which the predator is excluded. Our results highlight that evo-evolutionary feedbacks can alter community structure by mediating coexistence or leading to trait-dependent alternative stable states.",W2949425566,True,0.9933124780654907

Predators may increase lower trophic levels (bacteria) by reducing density of bacteriovores, by altering behavior of bacteriovores, and by processing living bacteriovores into carcasses, feces, and dissolved nutrients that are substrates for bacteria. We tested these pathways in laboratory experiments with mosquitoes in water‐filled containers. Larval Toxorhynchites rutilus prey on larval Aedes triseriatus, which feed on bacteria. Using containers stocked with oak leaf infusion as a bacterial substrate, we compared bacterial productivity at 7 and 14 days for: prey alone; prey with a predator; and prey with predation cues but no predator. Controls contained no larvae, either with predation cues or without cues. Predation cues in the control treatment increased bacterial abundance at 7 days, but this effect waned by 14 days. Aedes triseriatus larvae reduced bacterial abundance significantly at 14 days. Predator cues and real predation both eliminated the negative effect of A. triseriatus on bacterial abundance. Predation cues reduced survivorship of A. triseriatus larvae at 14 days, however this effect was smaller than the effect of real predation. We further tested effects of residues from predation as cues or as detritus in a second experiment in which A. triseriatus were killed at similar rates by: real predators ; mechanical damage without the predator and carcasses left as detritus; or mechanical damage and carcasses removed. No prey larvae were killed in controls. Bacterial productivity was greater with real predation than in all other treatments and greater when prey larvae were killed or killed and removed, than in controls. Thus we find evidence that all three pathways contribute to the trophic cascade from T. rutilus to bacteria in tree hole systems.",W2080441584,True,0.9591690301895142

While often modelled as a two-species interaction between host and parasite, some systems are more complex due to effects of host enemies, intraguild predation, and endosymbionts, all of which affect host immunity. However, it remains unclear how these factors, combined with genetic variation in the host and the parasitoid, affect host immunity. We address this question in an important agricultural pest system, the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, which shows significant intraspecific variability in immunity to the parasitoid wasp Aphidius ervi. In a complex experiment, we use a quantitative genetic design in the parasitoid, two ecologically different aphid lineages and the aphid lion Chrysoperla carnea as an intraguild predator to unravel the complex interdependencies. We demonstrate that aphid immunity as a key trait of this complex host-parasite system is affected by intraspecific genetic variation in the parasitoid and the aphid, the interaction of intraspecific genetic variation with intraguild predation, and differences in defensive endosymbionts between aphid lineages. Further, aphid lineages differ in their altruistic behaviour whereby infested aphids move away from the clonal colony to facilitate predation. Our findings provide new insights into the influence of endosymbiosis and genetic variability in an important host-parasitoid system which is influenced by natural enemies of the parasitoid and the aphid, including its endosymbiont communities. We show that endosymbiosis can mediate or influence the evolutionary arms race between aphids and their natural enemies.

The intensity of intra‐ and interspecific competition for dung as a breeding resource is substantially higher in WA. First, we tested whether differential resource competition in the two exotic ranges is associated with divergences in life history traits, which impact on resource use. We predicted that high levels of resource competition in WA should favor females that produce brood balls more efficiently and of altered size, and produce offspring more readily when a breeding opportunity arises. Furthermore, we predicted that larvae from WA populations may have evolved more efficient development and thus exhibit higher eclosion success, shorter development time, and altered body size under standardized conditions. Second, we examined the likely developmental mechanisms underlying these divergences, that is, genetic differentiation, developmental plasticity, or parental effects in a common garden experiment. Field‐collected EUS and WA populations significantly differed, as predicted, in most of the traits examined. However, these differences are facilitated by a complex combination of proximate mechanisms. Developmental plasticity and (grand) parental effects mediated differences related to reproductive performance, whereas genetic differentiation mediated differences in the duration of larval development. Our study highlights that population divergences can be the product of a patchwork of proximate mechanisms, with each mechanism adjusting different traits in a way that the resulting composite phenotype may be better suited to its competitive environment.",W1830272747,True,0.901552140712738

However, to what extent does the distribution of trait variation among ecological scales differ between leaf and wood tissues and between physical and chemical traits? What are the consequences of resource competition and/or habitat filtering on the community assembly with respect to differences between leaf and wood traits, and between physical and chemical traits? Location Subtropical evergreen broad‐leaved forests in five sites in the Ningbo area (29°41–50′ N, 121°36–52′ E) in eastern China. Methods Traits of 96 woody plant species were sampled and variation of ten physical‐ and chemical‐based leaf and wood traits were partitioned across six ecological scales (site, plot, species, individual plant, twigs and leaf age) using a linear mixed model. Results From individual plant to site scales, variance partitions were distinct between leaf and wood traits. In leaf tissues, physical and chemical traits showed a consistent pattern, with the majority of variation found among species and individual plants, with little among plots. For wood tissues, the largest variation in physical traits was at the species and individual plant scales, with the largest variation in chemical traits observed at the plot scale. Variance partition was markedly similar within and across species. Conclusion Leaf and wood traits vary differently in relation to ecological scale, suggesting that trait variability is tissue‐specific. The large variability of wood traits at the plot scale suggests a strong habitat filtering process. The large variation in leaf traits within plots may reflect niche differentiation across species and the importance of intra‐specific variation that affects species co‐existence. Our study demonstrated that physical and chemical traits may be independent. These decoupled trait axes may increase the dimensionality of niche space and facilitate species co‐existence in forest communities.",W2164897642,True,0.9258151054382324

Female common lizards display a polymorphism in ventral colour correlated with differences in reproduction, dispersal, and susceptibility to resource competition. We tested the hypothesis that this polymorphism is correlated with differences in behaviour in a social context. We studied the agonistic behaviour (aggression and avoidance) and social stress of females of different colours during laboratory-staged encounters with a limiting resource. We found that the behaviour of females was affected by their own colour, or the colour of their opponent, or both. Such alternative behavioural patterns might reflect differences in competitive ability. Orange females were the least aggressive and the most likely to avoid social interactions, and thus could be a weaker competitor. Yellow females were rarely exposed to aggression and often made their opponents flee, and thus might have higher resource-holding potential. Mixed females were aggressive but were also often exposed to aggression, and displayed the highest stress level, which could be characteristic of an intermediate or condition-dependent resource-holding potential. The possibility that ventral colour is used in social interactions to signal resource-holding potential is discussed.RésuméChez le lézard vivipare, la compétition pour les ressources entre femelles est probablement une pression de sélection forte, qui pourrait avoir favorisé l'évolution de signaux visibles. Les femelles lézards vivipares présentent un polymorphisme de couleur ventrale, corrélé à des différences au niveau de la reproduction, de la dispersion, et de la sensibilité à la compétition pour les ressources. Nous avons testé l'hypothèse que ce polymorphisme est corrélé à des différences de comportement dans un contexte social. Nous avons étudié le comportement agonistique (agression et évitement) et le stress social de femelles de différentes couleurs au cours de confrontations en laboratoire en présence d'une ressource limitante. Nous avons trouvé que le comportement des femelles était influencé par leur propre couleur, celle de la femelle opposante, ou l'interaction des deux. Une telle variation comportementale pourrait refléter des différences individuelles de potentiel compétitif. L'un des morphes de couleur était le moins agressif et le plus enclin à éviter les interactions sociales, il pourrait donc être le moins compétitif. Au contraire, un autre morphe était rarement agressé et provoquait souvent la fuite de son opposant, il pourrait avoir un fort potentiel compétitif. Enfin, le troisième morphe était agressif, mais également souvent agressé, et montrait le plus haut niveau de stress social, ce qui pourrait être caractéristique d'un potentiel compétitif intermédiaire ou dépendant de la condition. Nous discutons de la possibilité que la couleur ventrale soit utilisée dans les interactions sociales pour signaler le potentiel compétitif des individus.Keywords: laboratory-staged encountersresource holding potentialsignalssocial competitionMots-clés: compétition socialeconfrontations en laboratoirepotentiel compétitifsignaux",W2140912150,True,0.9802214503288269
https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.13023,Fine‐root and mycorrhizal traits help explain ecosystem processes and responses to global change,"'Root systems of perennial plants possess a high degree of complexity and the first step to understanding this complexity is to realize that not all roots and root systems are the same.' In this report, we discuss two key themes that emerged from the International Symposium on Critical Zone Biochemistry and Belowground Ecological Research. First, we discuss the need to identify broad patterns of root and mycorrhizal trait variation, both across and within species, as an effective means to understand and predict variation in function across species and sites, and through time. Second, we assert that, to fully understand the role roots and mycorrhizal fungi play in ecosystem processes, a broader perspective that relates their function to both short-term activity (e.g. acquisition of soil resources) and long-term changes in ecosystem function and community composition is required. Finally, we emphasize the need for a global effort in root and mycorrhizal research to synchronize methods of data collection and sharing for more powerful comparisons of belowground activity. Linking plant traits with function has been a valuable approach for understanding plant systems, particularly above ground, where traits including xylem anatomy, leaf mass per unit area, and leaf nitrogen (N) content often serve as indicators of plant hydraulic conductance, leaf lifespan, and photosynthetic capacity, respectively. Below ground, wide variation in both root and mycorrhizal traits has been observed (Fig. 1) and linking this trait variation to ecosystem processes was a common theme during much of the meeting. More broadly, developing greater appreciation of root and mycorrhizal function across species and environments greatly enhances understanding of whole-ecosystem processes, as roots and soil fungi have been identified as key drivers of C and nutrient cycling in terrestrial systems (Ostonen et al., 2011; Iversen et al., 2012; Clemmensen et al., 2013). Root systems of perennial plants possess a high degree of complexity and the first step to understanding this complexity is to realize that not all roots and root systems are the same. Even among distal, first-order roots, pioneer and fibrous roots maintain morphological differences at birth that are intrinsically linked to their function (Zadworny & Eissenstat, 2011). These and other differences in root anatomy, morphology, and physiology among and within species often relate to differences in root function (Fig. 2). For example, variations in root diameter, root length density, N concentration, root hair density, and mycorrhizal colonization all have links to total plant uptake capacity and represent tradeoffs among different acquisition strategies. Variation in basic root traits may also provide information on how plastic species of plants may be in response to changing environments. At the meeting, David Eissenstat (Pennsylvania State University, USA) discussed recent work in a common garden where fertilizer application in localized patches increased root survivorship in species with smaller root diameters (more plastic response) but not in those with larger root diameters (less plastic response) (Adams et al., 2013). Extending beyond roots and further exploring the soil, mycorrhizal fungi form an intimate symbiosis with many plant species and represent the most distal portion of the root–fungal resource acquisition system. Here again, systematic differences in mycorrhizal traits can provide useful clues regarding their activity and persistence in soils (Fig. 2). Recent reviews have highlighted the potential for categorizing mycorrhizal fungi based on observable/measurable traits that then relate to their function and broader ecosystem impacts (Van Der Heijden & Scheublin, 2007; Chagnon et al., 2013; Phillips et al., 2013; Koide et al., 2014). For example, at the meeting Erik Hobbie (University of New Hampshire, USA) presented recent work showing that C and N isotopes can be used to infer activity and exploration strategies of ectomycorrhizal fungi (Hobbie & Agerer, 2009), while others have reported that the degree of fungal tissue melanization may relate to stress tolerance and persistence (Fernandez & Koide, 2013). Indeed, the high diversity and often cryptic nature of mycorrhizal fungi may necessitate the use of functional traits to better understand mycorrhizal form, functional relationships, and ecosystem effects. Ecosystem responses to climate change, altered land use, and species invasions are often the result of complex interactions among multiple ecosystem components. As such, observing below- and aboveground processes independently may result in limited and potentially erroneous conclusions. Based on a series of experiments conducted using species common in grasslands of Inner Mongolia, China, Wen-Hao Zhang (Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China) presented evidence that shifts in species abundance with N deposition, long thought to be the result of increasing light competition, may result from multiple factors including a decrease in soil pH which increases the availability of manganese (Mn), leading to Mn toxicity in forbs (W-H. Zhang, unpublished). As a result of fundamental differences between dicots and monocots in their biochemical pathways for uptake of Mn and iron, grasses were favored over forbs and overall ecosystem diversity declined. Interestingly, similar declines in sugar maple (Acer saccharum) have been observed with chronic N deposition in parts of the northeast USA. Here again, declines resulted from altered plant nutrition that first began with an increased availability of Mn in acidified soils and reduced availability of primary nutrients (St Clair & Lynch, 2005). In both ecosystems, only by observing aboveground portions of ecosystems in the context of belowground processes could changes in ecosystem function be understood. Species invasions offer some of the most compelling examples demonstrating the need to integrate belowground processes into a whole-ecosystem perspective. Indeed, many studies now link interactions among roots and soil biota as important factors determining the success of an invading plant species. For example, the success of the invasive garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) is attributed, at least in part, to its ability to inhibit mycorrhizal fungi, thereby reducing the ability of many competing plant species to obtain soil resources (Stinson et al., 2006). Recent work presented by Ian Dickie (Lincoln University, New Zealand) provides evidence for facilitation of invasive Pinus contorta in New Zealand by co-invasion of ectomycorrhizal symbionts which may be further mediated by invasions of nonnative mammals (Dickie et al., 2010; J. R. Wood et al., unpublished). This is a fascinating example of how multi-stage and multi-component interactions dictate the composition and function of many terrestrial ecosystems, including novel ecosystems created through concurrent invasions of multiple species from multiple continents. Currently, many ecosystem- and global-scale models express highly simplified descriptions of root processes with little to no mechanistic function tied to spatial and temporal patterns of root growth (Smithwick et al., 2014). Furthermore, few models explicitly incorporate mycorrhizal fungi requiring C and nutrient fluxes through mycorrhizal biomass to be captured indirectly if at all (but see Orwin et al., 2011; Phillips et al., 2013; Deckmyn et al., 2014). However, accurately modeling ecosystem processes along environmental gradients or responses to global change factors requires greater empirical understanding of root and mycorrhizal processes in conjunction with their impacts on ecosystem functioning (Ostonen et al., 2011; Iversen et al., 2012). To that end, some of the most important discussions in Beijing were centered on the development of a functional database of root traits and a network linking rhizosphere–ecosystem research across the globe. Development of an improved, publicly available database coupled with an organized network of sites investigating links between above- and belowground ecology could provide an efficient way to gain and supply data needed by modelers. Led by Colleen Iversen (Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA), efforts are underway to develop a comprehensive root trait database through expansions of the existing TRY plant trait database (www.try-db.org) and additional service through Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) data centers. Importantly, this database will (1) accommodate submission of root traits by individual root order, which enables more meaningful comparisons across species, and (2) emphasize traits and processes with specific relevance to terrestrial biosphere models. Furthermore, recent efforts in China have also seen the development of a domestic network of sites focused on linking belowground and whole-ecosystem processes, RhizoNet. Though in its infancy, this and other networks may be developed into coordinated global networks where open exchange of ideas and research methodologies will greatly improve cross-site data comparisons and enhance overall appreciation of terrestrial processes. Together, these and other efforts to identify global patterns of root and mycorrhizal traits across diverse phylogenies will pay dividends in the future as we seek to understand root and fungal responses to environmental perturbations. As consistent patterns emerge, these basic trait data can then be used to inform novel hypotheses testing the mechanisms that determine variation in rhizosphere function. Ultimately, understanding rhizosphere processes may be the key to accurately describing and anticipating global patterns of ecosystem functioning today and into the future.",W2017456328,True,0.9830551147460938
https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13200,Competition drives trait evolution and character displacement between <i>Mimulus</i> species along an environmental gradient,"Closely related species may evolve to coexist stably in sympatry through niche differentiation driven by in situ competition, a process termed character displacement. Alternatively, past evolution in allopatry may have already sufficiently reduced niche overlap to permit establishment in sympatry, a process called ecological sorting. The relative importance of each process to niche differentiation is contentious even though they are not mutually exclusive and are both mediated via multivariate trait evolution. We explore how competition has impacted niche differentiation in two monkeyflowers, Mimulus alsinoides and M. guttatus, which often co-occur. Through field observations, common gardens, and competition experiments, we demonstrate that M. alsinoides is restricted to marginal habitats in sympatry and that the impacts of character displacement on niche differentiation are complex. Competition with M. guttatus alters selection gradients and has favored taller M. alsinoides with earlier seasonal flowering at low elevation and floral shape divergence at high elevation. However, no trait exhibits the pattern typically associated with character displacement, higher divergence between species in sympatry than allopatry. Thus, although character displacement was unlikely the process driving initial divergence along niche axes necessary for coexistence, we conclude that competition in sympatry has likely driven trait evolution along additional niche axes.",W2587620327,True,0.9650911092758179
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12403,The sign of cascading predator effects varies with prey traits in a detrital system,"Theory and experiments show that the nature of 'green' trophic cascades, between predators, herbivores and plants, varies with several key species traits: predator hunting mode and predator and prey habitat domains. Meanwhile, 'brown' cascades between predators, environment-modifying detritivores and plants have been largely overlooked and the roles of species traits, particularly prey traits, in determining the nature of these cascades remains unclear. We hypothesize that, in predator-detritivore-plant interaction chains, the burrowing ability of plant-facilitating detritivores determines their response to predators and thus the sign of indirect effect transmitted. In the dung-decomposer food web of an alpine meadow, we predicted that in the presence of above-ground predacious beetles: (i) non-burrowing detritivores will suffer mortality due to predation and transmit negative indirect effects to plants, whereas (ii) burrowing detritivores will escape predation by retreating deeper into the soil, transmitting positive indirect effects to plants. In support of predictions, experiments showed that a single species of predacious beetle (i) reduced the density of the non-burrowing species and indirectly reduced dung loss rate, soil nutrient concentrations and plant biomass, but (ii) drove the burrowing species deeper, indirectly improved soil conditions and increased plant biomass. These results show that the burrowing ability of a detritivore can determine whether it transmits a negative indirect effect mediated by a reduction in its density, or a positive indirect effect mediated by its behavioural response to predation risk. We call for further tests of our detritivore-trait hypothesis in different regions and ecosystems to further develop a general trait-based framework for trophic cascades in detrital food webs. We further advance the general hypothesis that the locomotion traits of prey species (e.g. burrowing/flying ability) may help explain their behavioural response to predation risk and the nature of indirect effect they transmit from predators to plants.",W1549655949,True,0.9813133478164673
https://doi.org/10.3390/d12100397,Can Functional Traits Explain Plant Coexistence? A Case Study with Tropical Lianas and Trees,"Organisms are adapted to their environment through a suite of anatomical, morphological, and physiological traits. These functional traits are commonly thought to determine an organism’s tolerance to environmental conditions. However, the differences in functional traits among co-occurring species, and whether trait differences mediate competition and coexistence is still poorly understood. Here we review studies comparing functional traits in two co-occurring tropical woody plant guilds, lianas and trees, to understand whether competing plant guilds differ in functional traits and how these differences may help to explain tropical woody plant coexistence. We examined 36 separate studies that compared a total of 140 different functional traits of co-occurring lianas and trees. We conducted a meta-analysis for ten of these functional traits, those that were present in at least five studies. We found that the mean trait value between lianas and trees differed significantly in four of the ten functional traits. Lianas differed from trees mainly in functional traits related to a faster resource acquisition life history strategy. However, the lack of difference in the remaining six functional traits indicates that lianas are not restricted to the fast end of the plant life–history continuum. Differences in functional traits between lianas and trees suggest these plant guilds may coexist in tropical forests by specializing in different life–history strategies, but there is still a significant overlap in the life–history strategies between these two competing guilds.",W3092745668,True,0.9128941297531128
https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2013.0879,Parasites that change predator or prey behaviour can have keystone effects on community composition,"Parasites play pivotal roles in structuring communities, often via indirect interactions with non-host species. These effects can be density-mediated (through mortality) or trait-mediated (behavioural, physiological and developmental), and may be crucial to population interactions, including biological invasions. For instance, parasitism can alter intraguild predation (IGP) between native and invasive crustaceans, reversing invasion outcomes. Here, we use mathematical models to examine how parasite-induced trait changes influence the population dynamics of hosts that interact via IGP. We show that trait-mediated indirect interactions impart keystone effects, promoting or inhibiting host coexistence. Parasites can thus have strong ecological impacts, even if they have negligible virulence, underscoring the need to consider trait-mediated effects when predicting effects of parasites on community structure in general and biological invasions in particular.",W2164023607,True,0.9705756902694702
https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.03800,Direct litter interference and indirect soil competitive effects of two contrasting phenotypes of a spiny legume shrub drive the forb composition of an oromediterranean community,"Contrasting phenotypes of foundation species are known to differentially affect understorey plants. However, there is little knowledge on both the mechanisms of competition (resource competition versus interference) of stress‐tolerant phenotypes and the importance of indirect interactions. In an oromediterranean community from Mount Lebanon we assessed the effects on understorey forbs of two contrasting phenotypes, a tight competitive from stressful habitat and a loose facilitative from more benign habitat. In a dry south and a wet north exposure we assessed short‐term resource effects removing shrub canopy and long‐term soil effects (including litter interference) with the comparison of forb performances in adjacent naturally open areas vs no shrub. Indirect effects were quantified through the removal of grasses. Abundance, richness and biomass of forbs were measured in all treatments after one year of experiment, together with litter depth and soil moisture. We found strong direct negative soil effects of the tight phenotype on all forb performances and in particular in south exposure. These effects were due to litter interference on water availability, but not to resource competition. They were likely explained by the high hydrophobicity of organic matter accumulating in the stressful habitat of the tight phenotype. We also found an indirect competition of the loose phenotype for forb richness, due to its direct positive soil effect on competitive grasses, and in particular in south exposure. Our results improve our knowledge on the importance of litter interference in dry nutrient‐poor habitats and the role of indirect interactions in phenotypic effects on understorey species.",W2564056314,True,0.9707966446876526

Asynarchus larvae predominate in temporary wetlands and are aggressive intraguild predators on Limnephilus larvae, which only predominate in permanent basins with salamanders. We first conducted a field experiment in mesocosms (cattle tanks) to quantify the predatory effects of different life stages of salamanders on the two caddisfly species. Two life stages of the salamanders (larvae and paedomorphs) preferentially preyed on Asynarchus relative to Limnephilus. Subsequent laboratory experiments revealed that high Asynarchus activity rates and relatively ineffective antipredatory behaviors led to higher salamander detection and attack rates compared to Limnephilus. In a second field experiment (full factorial for presence and absence of each of the three species), we found that salamander predation on Asynarchus had an indirect positive effect on Limnephilus: survival was higher in the presence of salamanders + Asynarchus than with just Asynarchus. In the laboratory we compared the predatory effects of salamanders with and without their mouths sewn shut and found the observed indirect positive effect on Limnephilus survival to be mainly the result of reduced numbers of Asynarchus rather than salamander-induced changes in Asynarchus behavior. We argue that indirect effects of predator–predator interactions on shared prey will be mainly density-mediated and not trait-mediated when one of the predators (in this case, Asynarchus) is under strong selection for rapid growth and therefore does not modify foraging behaviors in response to the other predator. The reciprocal dominance of Limnephilus and Asynarchus in habitats with and without salamanders probably reflects a trade-off between competitive superiority and vulnerability to predation. The high activity levels and aggressiveness that enable Asynarchus to complete development in temporary habitats result in strong asymmetric competition (via intraguild predation) with Limnephilus. In permanent habitats these same behaviors increase Asynarchus vulnerability to salamander predation, which indirectly benefits Limnephilus. This and previous work implicate salamanders as keystone predators that exert a major influence on the composition of benthic and planktonic assemblages in subalpine wetlands.",W2008976596,True,0.9458919763565063
https://doi.org/10.5194/bgd-11-13157-2014,Testing functional trait-based mechanisms underpinning plant responses to grazing and linkages to ecosystem functioning in grasslands,"Abstract. Abundant evidence has shown that grazing alters plant functional traits, ecological strategies, community structure, and ecosystem functioning of grasslands. Few studies, however, have examined how plant responses to grazing are mediated by resource availability and functional group identity. We test functional trait-based mechanisms underlying the responses of different life forms to grazing and linkages to ecosystem functioning along a soil moisture gradient in the Inner Mongolia grassland. A principal component analysis (PCA) based on 9 traits × 276 species matrix showed that the plant size spectrum (i.e., individual biomass), leaf economics spectrum (leaf N content and leaf density), and light competition spectrum (height and stem-leaf biomass ratio) distinguished plant species responses to grazing. The three life forms exhibited differential strategies as indicated by trait responses to grazing. The annuals and biennials adopted grazing-tolerant strategies associated with high growth rate, reflected by high leaf N content and specific leaf area. The perennial grasses exhibited grazing-tolerant strategies associated with great regrowth capacity and high palatability scores, whereas perennial forbs showed grazing-avoidant strategies with short stature and low palatability scores. In addition, the dominant perennial bunchgrasses exhibited mixed tolerance–resistance strategies to grazing and mixed acquisitive–conservative strategies in resource utilization. Grazing increased the relative abundance of perennial forbs with low palatability in the wet and fertile meadow, but it promoted perennial grasses with high palatability in the dry and infertile typical steppe. Our findings suggest that the effects of grazing on plant functional traits are dependent on both the abiotic (e.g., soil moisture) and biotic (e.g., plant functional group identity and composition) factors. Grazing-induced shifts in functional group composition are largely dependent on resource availability, particularly water availability.",W2164373077,True,0.9540144205093384
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.14042,Diet quality and conspecific larval density predict functional trait variation and performance in a polyphagous frugivorous fly,"Abstract Diet quality and the presence and abundance of conspecifics feeding on the same food resource are critical factors that affect functional traits of many animal species and influence ecological processes. We hypothesized that in insects whose larvae live in groups of varying sizes in ephemeral and nutritionally variable environments, extreme macronutrient content in the feeding substrate is a barrier for optimal performance that can be overcome by the collective feeding behaviour of large numbers of larvae. We experimentally examined how multiple immature and adult traits of the polyphagous tephritid fruit fly, Anastrepha ludens, vary as a function of the quality of its larval diet (protein + carbohydrate [P + C] content of 8.0%–12.6% w/w, and protein‐to‐carbohydrate [P/C] ratio of 1.8–0.11) across extreme levels of conspecific larval densities (60–600 larvae/60 g of diet). Overall, we found positive effects on survival of immature and adult stages, the duration of the larval stage, pupal weight and adult emergence of flies, as dietary P + C content increased, followed by negative effects when the diet had extremely high carbohydrate‐biased macronutrient content. Larval density had positive, negative and curvilinear effects depending on the macronutrient composition of the food, resulting in a range of fly responses through a continuous scale of macronutrient content and larval density combinations. Optimal performance of A. ludens, in terms of larval development time, body weight and survival to adulthood, was found when the diet consisted of low P + C content and high P/C ratios, and low larval densities. Our findings point to a diet‐mediated relationship between density and survival to the adult stage, suggesting that large numbers (up to a point) of larvae can balance negative effects of conspecific competition when food is characterised by high macronutrient content and low P/C ratios. We conclude that diet quality and conspecific density interact in complex ways to shape trait expression and performance in a frugivorous fly. Addressing this interaction is key to advance the understanding of the mechanisms behind changes in population dynamics in insect species living in groups confined in isolated and ephemeral resources.

https://doi.org/10.1071/bt07150,Plant trait - environmental linkages among contrasting landscapes and climate regimes in temperate eucalypt woodlands,"Ecological sorting of species along climate and landscape gradients is a fundamental global pattern. However, the extent to which functional traits reflect floristic turnover in response to interactions between climate and landscape gradients is rarely assessed. We tested whether floristic variation among sites within a bioregion was more strongly correlated with soil fertility or climate. We then examined the relationship between floristic composition, environment and the co-variation of selected vegetative and regenerative functional traits. This allowed us to assess the ecological sorting of species along soil fertility and rainfall gradients and to detect any resource compensation effects via interactions between these factors. Floristic differences were equally associated with soil fertility and climate contrasts but species’ trait patterns were more strongly associated with soil fertility than rainfall. No interactive effects, which would suggest resource compensation, were detected. Instead, more fertile sites consistently had more forbs, annuals and grasses in comparison with less fertile sites which were dominated by woody species and had a higher abundance of graminoids. Three broad mechanisms for sorting of species based on trait patterns are proposed (1) differences in the fundamental regenerative and growth niche, (2) resource competition during establishment and (3) disturbance-mediated sorting.",W2161049907,True,0.9896279573440552
