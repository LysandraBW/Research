Apparent competition is an indirect interaction among prey species mediated by a shared predator, and has been increasingly linked to declines of prey species across taxa. We review theoretical and empirical studies of apparent competition, with specific attention to the mechanisms of asymmetry among apparently competing prey species. Asymmetry is theoretically driven by niche overlap, species fitness traits, spatial heterogeneity and generalist predator behavior. In real‐world systems, human‐induced changes to ecosystems such as habitat alteration and introduced species may be ultimate sources of species endangerment. However, apparent competition is shown to be a proximate mechanism when resultant changes introduce or subsidize abundant primary prey for predator populations. Demonstration of apparent competition is difficult due to the indirect relationships between prey and predator species and the potential for concurrent exploitative competition or other community effects. However, general conclusions are drawn concerning the characteristics of prey and predator species likely to exhibit asymmetric apparent competition, and the options for recovering endangered species. While short‐term management may be required to avoid imminent extinction in systems demonstrating apparent competition, we propose adaptive conservation efforts directed at long‐term recovery.",W1563702561,False,0.8761112093925476

Research across diverse taxa suggest they may play important roles in population divergence and speciation. They may involve various kinds of traits, including morphological and behavioral traits and those related to life history. Many of the evolutionary, ecological, and genetic mechanisms producing and maintaining resource polymorphisms are similar among phylogenetically distinct species. Although further studies are needed, the genetic basis may be simple, in some cases under the control of a single locus, with phenotypic plasticity playing a proximate role in some taxa. Divergent selection including either directional, disruptive, or frequency-dependent selection is important in their evolution. Generally, the invasion of “open” niches or underutilized resources requiring unique trophic characters and decreased interspecific competition have promoted the evolution of resource polymorphisms. Further investigations centered on their role in speciation, especially adaptive radiation, are likely to be fruitful.",W2111382033,False,0.7324073314666748
https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2014.00036,Network complexity and species traits mediate the effects of biological invasions on dynamic food webs,"Biological invasions are a major threat to natural communities worldwide. While several species traits have been identified as important determinants of invasion success, a systematic exploration of the effects of invasions on native communities, and the role of species and community features on community robustness in the face of invasion is lacking. We present a theoretical approximation considering food web structure and species population dynamics to study the effects of invasions on complex food webs. We find that less complex (i.e. less connected) food webs are more resistant to invasions. Simulated invasions promote profound changes in several food web properties and stability measures, such as decreases in modularity and the number of food chains from basal to top species; and a decoupling of community- and population-level temporal variability. Additionally, species traits such as body size and diet breadth are strong determinants of invasion success across several trophic levels, with larger and more generalist species being more successful invaders in general. Our work complements species-centred invasion studies by adding a more holistic and systematic perspective to the study of invasions on species interaction networks.",W2001887180,False,0.8839626908302307
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00937.x,Trait‐mediated apparent competition in an intraguild predator–prey system,"Apparent competition is of broad interest due to its effects on community structure and potential applications in agriculture, restoration, and medicine. It is well‐established that apparent competition can result from changes in predator abundance or behavior caused by interactions with alternate prey, but no previous empirical study has demonstrated that apparent competition can also result from prey‐induced changes in predator morphology. This trait‐mediated alternative mechanism of apparent competition would expand the range of conditions under which apparent competition might occur in nature and identify new ways to generate or modify apparent competition in applied contexts. Here, as a proof of concept, we show that trait‐mediated apparent competition can arise from inducible offenses and show how it operates using experiments involving three ciliates. When it feeds on Colpidium kleini, the intraguild predator Tetrahymena vorax increases in size to the extent that it can then consume Paramecium aurelia, an even larger prey. When feeding only on bacteria, however, Tetrahymena remains smaller and is unable to consume Paramecium. This trait‐mediated indirect effect leads to the predatory exclusion of Paramecium, while Tetrahymena and Colpidium coexist. Developmental expansions such as those underlying the interactions observed in our study are not limited to ciliates, such as Tetrahymena, but occur among many diverse taxa and may have a surprising degree of influence over the structure and dynamics of food webs.",W2082469143,False,0.7323148250579834
https://doi.org/10.1007/s101440200014,The role of antipredator behavior in an experimental community of jumping spiders with intraguild predation,"Abstract The role of direct and indirect interactions in intraguild predation (IGP) was investigated in a laboratory study. The study system contained two spider species, Phidippus audax and Phidippus octopunctatus, and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. P. audax and P. octopunctatus eat D. melanogaster. P. audax (top predators) also eat P. octopunctatus (intermediate predators). Thus, P. audax and P. octopunctatus compete for the shared resource and also interact as predator and prey. Experiments consisted of two treatments: risk‐IGP and full‐IGP. In the risk‐IGP treatments, I examined the effects of trait‐mediated indirect effects generated by antipredator behavior of P. octopunctatus on the survival of fruit flies. P. audax chelicerae were waxed so that P. audax could not attack a prey. The result indicated a significant positive indirect effect of P. audax on the survival of D. melanogaster due to the antipredator behavior of P. octopunctatus (a trait‐mediated indirect effect). In the full‐IGP treatments, P. audax chelicerae were not restricted, so that it could attack prey; this resulted in decreased survival of D. melanogaster. Because of predation of P. audax on P. octopunctatus, even stronger positive interactions occurred between P. audax and D. melanogaster in full‐IGP than in risk‐IGP.",W1978378549,False,0.4842769205570221
https://doi.org/10.1086/657436,Keystone Predation and Plant Species Coexistence: The Role of Carnivore Hunting Mode,"Plant communities are shaped by bottom-up processes such as competition for nutrients and top-down processes such as herbivory. Although much theoretical work has studied how herbivores can mediate plant species coexistence, indirect effects caused by the carnivores that consume herbivores have been largely ignored. These carnivores can have significant indirect effects on plants by altering herbivore density (density-mediated effects) and behavior (trait-mediated effects). Carnivores that differ in traits, particularly in their hunting mode, cause different indirect effects on plants and, ultimately, different plant community compositions. We analyze a food-web model to determine how plant coexistence is affected by herbivore-consuming carnivores, contrasting those causing only density-mediated effects with those causing trait-mediated effects as well. In the latter case, herbivores can adjust their consumption of a refuge plant species. We derive a general graphical model to study the interplay of density- and trait-mediated effects. We show that carnivores eliciting both effects can sustain plant species coexistence, given intermediate intensities of behavioral adjustments. Coexistence is more likely, and more stable, if the refuge plant is competitively dominant. These results extend our understanding of carnivore indirect effects in food webs and show that behavioral effects can have major consequences on plant community structure, stressing the need for theoretical approaches that incorporate dynamical traits.",W2031823252,False,0.8257344365119934

Using a plant‐pollinator system as a model, I tested the prediction the presence of a competitor for pollination influences the strength and/or direction of pollinator‐mediated selection on floral traits. I measured phenotypic selection via female fitness on five floral traits of Ipomopsis aggregata in seven populations. Four contained only conspecifics (I only) and three also contained the competitor Castilleja linariaefolia (C + I). Directional selection via fruits/plant and conspecific pollen deposited/flower on corolla length was positive and significantly stronger in C + I populations. This difference in selection was apparently driven by interpopulation variation in the degree to which reproduction of I. aggregata was pollen limited. Consistent with expectations of interspecific competition, I. aggregata plants in C + I populations received less conspecific pollen per flower and set fewer seeds per fruit and fruits per plant than those in I only populations. Ipomopsis aggregata's corollas were also significantly longer in C + I populations, suggesting that there had been a response to a similar selective regime in past generations. Phenotypic correlations between corolla length and width, which determine the variation in I. aggregata's flower shape, were significantly weaker in C + I populations. These data suggest that competition for pollination can influence the strength of selection on and patterns of correlations among floral traits of I. aggregata. If I. aggregata populations with and without competitors for pollination are linked by gene flow, then measuring selection in competitive and noncompetitive environments maybe necessary to accurately predict how floral traits will evolve.",W2133731375,False,0.7689735889434814

We performed CYP1A2 genotype and phenotype analysis using caffeine in Ethiopians living in Ethiopia (<i>n</i> = 100) or in Sweden (<i>n</i> = 73). We sequenced the <i>CYP1A2</i> gene using genomic DNA from 12 subjects, which revealed a novel intron 1 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), –730C&gt;T. We developed SNP-specific polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism genotyping and molecular haplotyping methods for the intron 1 SNPs, and four different haplotypes were identified: <i>CYP1A2*1A</i> (wild-type for all SNPs), <i>CYP1A2*1F</i> (–164A), <i>CYP1A2*1J</i> (–740G and –164A), and <i>CYP1A2*1K</i> (–730T, –740G, and –164A), having frequencies of 39.9, 49.6, 7.5, and 3.0%, respectively. The frequency of <i>CYP1A2*1J</i> and <i>CYP1A2*1K</i> among Saudi Arabians (<i>n</i> = 136) was 5.9% and 3.6%, and among Spaniards (<i>n</i> = 117) 1.3% and 0.5%, respectively. Functional significance of the different intron 1 haplotypes was analyzed. Subjects with <i>CYP1A2*1K</i> had significantly decreased CYP1A2 activity in vivo, and reporter constructs with this haplotype had significantly less inducibility with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-<i>p</i>-dioxin in human B16A2 hepatoma cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using nuclear extracts from B16A2 cells revealed a specific DNA binding protein complex to an Ets element.

In contrast with previous studies, we found no evidence for significant over- or under-dispersion of maximum plant height, maximum plant biomass, or seed mass. 2 These findings hold across three plot sizes (10 × 10 cm, 30 × 30 cm, 50 × 50 cm), and when plot size is measured in terms of number of ramets (50 ramets, 250 ramets or 500 ramets) rather than per unit area. Plot size, however, significantly affected the direction of dispersion observed across test statistics, supporting previous studies that have observed that trait dispersion patterns are sensitive to plot size. 3 While no significant dispersion was detected, dispersion direction, measured as the tendency for a two-tailed test to indicate trends for a given trait, was more frequently observed when analyses were weighted by abundance. Abundance weighted analyses had significantly different dispersion directions compared with presence/absence analyses for one of three traits considered. These findings suggest that abundance weighted analyses may yield more consistent trait dispersion patterns. 4 Synthesis. Our results may be interpreted as evidence for limited, if any, functional niche partitioning between co-occurring species via size-mediated differences in rooting depth or physical space niches (i.e. limiting similarity). Alternatively, some species with large differences in competitive traits may avoid competition through niche separation, while others may simply compete asymmetrically, leading to overall patterns of dispersion that cannot be distinguished from random. This interpretation supports recent perspectives that niche and neutral theoretical concepts are not mutually exclusive; both, working together, can be applied to the interpretation of plant community assembly and structure.",W2155961701,False,0.8096230626106262
https://doi.org/10.1186/s40529-017-0183-9,Allelopathy and resource competition: the effects of Phragmites australis invasion in plant communities,"Phragmites australis, a ubiquitous wetland plant, has been considered one of the most invasive species in the world. Allelopathy appears to be one of the invasion mechanisms, however, the effects could be masked by resource competition among target plants. The difficulty of distinguishing allelopathy from resource competition among plants has hindered investigations of the role of phytotoxic allelochemicals in plant communities. This has been addressed via experiments conducted in both the greenhouse and laboratory by growing associated plants, Melaleuca ericifolia, Rumex conglomeratus, and model plant, Lactuca sativa at varying densities with the allelopathic plant, P. australis, its litter and leachate of P. australis litter. This study investigated the potential interacting influences of allelopathy and resource competition on plant growth-density relationships.In greenhouse, the root exudates mediated effects showed the strongest growth inhibition of M. ericifolia at high density whereas litter mediated results revealed increased growth at medium density treatments compared to low and high density. Again, laboratory experiments related to seed germination and seedling growth of L. sativa and R. conglomeratus exhibited phytotoxicity decreased showing positive growth as plant density increased and vice versa. Overall, the differential effects were observed among experiments but maximum individual plant biomass and some other positive effects on plant traits such as root and shoot length, chlorophyll content occurred at an intermediate density. This was attributed to the sharing of the available phytotoxin among plants at high densities which is compatible to density-dependent phytotoxicity model.The results demonstrated that plant-plant interference is the combined effect of allelopathy and resource competition with many other factors but this experimental design, target-neighbor mixed-culture in combination of plant grown at varying densities with varying level of phytotoxins, mono-culture, can successfully separate allelopathic effects from competition.",W2729547631,False,0.8414474129676819
https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.12996,Robustness of trait connections across environmental gradients and growth forms,"Abstract Aim Plant trait databases often contain traits that are correlated, but for whom direct (undirected statistical dependency) and indirect (mediated by other traits) connections may be confounded. The confounding of correlation and connection hinders our understanding of plant strategies, and how these vary among growth forms and climate zones. We identified the direct and indirect connections across plant traits relevant to competition, resource acquisition and reproductive strategies using a global database and explored whether connections within and between traits from different tissue types vary across climates and growth forms. Location Global. Major taxa studied Plants. Time period Present. Methods We used probabilistic graphical models and a database of 10 plant traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, mass‐ and area‐based leaf nitrogen and phosphorous content, leaf life span, plant height, stem specific density and seed mass) with 16,281 records to describe direct and indirect connections across woody and non‐woody plants across tropical, temperate, arid, cold and polar regions. Results Trait networks based on direct connections are sparser than those based on correlations. Land plants had high connectivity across traits within and between tissue types; leaf life span and stem specific density shared direct connections with all other traits. For both growth forms, two groups of traits form modules of more highly connected traits; one related to resource acquisition, the other to plant architecture and reproduction. Woody species had higher trait network modularity in polar compared to temperate and tropical climates, while non‐woody species did not show significant differences in modularity across climate regions. Main conclusions Plant traits are highly connected both within and across tissue types, yet traits segregate into persistent modules of traits. Variation in the modularity of trait networks suggests that trait connectivity is shaped by prevailing environmental conditions and demonstrates that plants of different growth forms use alternative strategies to cope with local conditions.",W2971500937,False,0.7325516939163208

In a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 51 male subjects expressing an atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype (ALP) had their diets supplemented with fish oil for 6 weeks. As we previously reported for this group, supplementation with LC n-3 PUFA produced a decrease in fasting plasma triglyceride (TG) (−35%, P < 0.05), attenuation of the postprandial TG response (area and incremental area under the curve; AUC and IAUC, P < 0.05), and a decrease in small, dense LDL.

A proposed genetic marker for coronary heart disease..Circulation. 1990; 82: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar), the atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype (ALP) defines a collection of abnormalities in plasma lipoproteins that confers a 3- to 6-fold increase in risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and features moderately raised plasma triglyceride (TG), low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and predominance of small, dense LDL (2Griffin B.A. Freeman D.J.

Ass. 1988; 260: 1917-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). An ALP originates from defects in TG metabolism that include the impaired clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins in the postprandial period, coupled with an oversupply of lipid substrates for the production of TG and thus secretion of apolipoprotien B (apoB) as TG-rich VLDL in the liver (4Packard C.J. Shepherd J. Lipoprotein heterogeneity and apolipoprotein B metabolism..Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3542-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Although the underlying molecular basis for these defects is not yet understood, interplay between insulin resistance and nutrient-gene interactions is likely to be central to the development and, potentially, to the correction of this high-risk dyslipidemia. Variation in response to different dietary fats is being increasingly ascribed to genetic heterogeneity and nutrient-gene interactions (5Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. Regulation of gene expression by dietary fatty acids..Ann. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 64-83Crossref Scopus (546) Google Scholar). While direct evidence for the role of dietary fatty acids and their derivatives as regulators of gene expression in humans is still lacking, it is likely that many of the potentially beneficial effects of long-chain n-3 PUFA (LC n-3 PUFA) on TG metabolism are mediated through the control of gene transcription and post-transcriptional events. Fish oil supplements have been shown to correct many of the metabolic sequelae associated with insulin resistance (6Collier G.R. Sinclair A.J. Role of N-6 and N-3 fatty acids in the dietary treatment of metabolic disorders..Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 1993; 683: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which includes decreasing the concentration of plasma TG in the pre and postprandial periods (7Harris W.S. Connor W.E. Alam N. Illingworth D.R. Reduction of postprandial triglyceridemia in humans by dietary n-3 fatty acids..J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1451-1460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fish oil may induce a reduction in VLDL by suppressing lipogenesis and by enhancing the oxidation of fatty acids, both of which are controlled at the level of gene transcription in the liver (8Clarke S.D. Jump T.D. Polyunsaturated fatty acids regulate lipogenic and peroxisomal gene expression by independent mechansisms..Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 1997; 57: 65-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). While these events will indirectly increase the capacity to clear plasma TG in the postprandial period, as a result of reduced competition for lipoprotein lipase (LPL), LC n-3 PUFA may also exert direct effects on the removal of TG-rich lipoproteins through stimulation of LPL in peripheral tissues (9Harris W.S. Lu G. Rambjor G.S. Walen A.I. Ontko J.A. Chang Q. Windsor S.L. Influence of n-3 fatty acid supplementation on the endogenous activities of plasma lipases..Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1997; 66: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). LPL activity is a rate-limiting determinant of the hydrolysis of TG in the plasma compartment. Although in quantitative terms the mass of muscle LPL far outweighs that of LPL in adipose tissue (AT-LPL), the latter removes relatively more TG in the postprandial period than skeletal muscle (10.Frayn, K. N. 1996. Integration of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism in the whole body. In Metabolic Regulation: A Human Perspective. K. Snell, editor. Portland Press, UK. 103–140. Google Scholar), making AT-LPL a prime target for metabolic regulation. While this is well known to occur acutely in response to insulin, considerably less is known about longer term regulation mediated by the effects of dietary fatty acids on the AT-LPL gene. There is evidence from animal studies (11Raclot T. Groscolas R. Langin D. Ferre P. Site-specific regulation of gene expression by n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in rat white adipose tissues..J.

Subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were taken under local anesthesia (2% lignocaine without adrenaline) from the gluteal region of the upper buttock between 4–5 h post-breakfast, and at exactly the same time on each of the two occasions. The choice of this specific tissue site was based on the finding that it minimized stress and subsequent inconvenience to the subjects. Approximately 200 mg of white subcutaneous adipose tissue was removed from a 2 cm incision. The incision was closed by a single exterior (prolene) stitch. White subcutaneous adipose tissue was weighed and immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Total RNA was extracted from 50 mg of tissue using RNAgents Total RNA Isolation System (Promega, Southampton, UK). This commercially available kit employs a modification of the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Single-step method of RNA isolation by acid guaninium thiocyanate-phenol-choloroform extraction..Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar). Briefly, tissue samples were homogenized in a guanidine thiocyanate denaturing solution, extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and precipitated overnight in isopropanol. RNA pellets were washed in ethanol and re-suspended in nuclease-free water. RNA concentrations were quantified spectrophotometrically at 260 nm using the Genequant II microspectrophotometer (Pharmacia Biotech, St. Albans, UK). Specific mRNA for LPL was quantified by reverse transcription followed by competitive polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This was performed using the multi-specific internal standard or competitor, published by Laville et al. (19Laville M. Auboeuf D. Khalfallah Y. Vega N. Riou J.P. Vidal H. Acute regulation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, Rad, GLUT 4 and lipoprotein lipase mRNA levels in human muscle..J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), kindly donated by Professor Hubert Vidal. The production of this competitor from the vector has been previously described by Murphy et al. (13Murphy M.C. Brooks C.N. Rockett J.C. Chapman C. Lovegrove J.A. Gould B.J. Wright J.W. Williams C.M. The quantitation of lipoprotein lipase mRNA in biopsies of human adipose tissue, using the polymerase chain reaction, and the effect of increased consumption of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids..Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 53: 441-447Google Scholar). RT-PCR utilized oligonucleotide primers that amplify both the competitor and the target RNA in the same reaction, producing cDNA products of different sizes, 267 bp and 227 bp, respectively. Reverse transcription and amplification were performed using the Access RT-PCR System Kit (Promega, Southampton, UK). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed at 48°C for 45 min and terminated at 94°C for 2 min. The cDNA products were amplified in the presence of Tfl DNA polymerase (supplied in the kit), annealing of primers at 60°C for 1 min and extension at 68°C for 2 min. Samples were subject to 27–30 cycles in an Omn-E thermal cycler (Hybaid, Middlesex, UK). In addition, β2-microglobulin mRNA was amplified in parallel tubes as an internal standard or ""house-keeping"" gene, using β2-microglobulin primers and under identical conditions. The amplification products were separated on 3% agarose gels pre-stained with ethidium bromide and photographed with a CCD video camera. Band intensities were evaluated from the negative film using gel scan software (Pharmacia Biotech Ltd, UK). The logarithm of the density ratio of the internal standard band (competitor) to the wild-type (target) cDNA band was plotted against the logarithm of the initial competitor concentration. The LPL mRNA results were normalized and expressed relative to the concentration of mRNA of β2-microglobulin. Blood was collected after an overnight fast into K2EDTA. DNA was extracted from nucleated cells by the salting-out method (20Miller S.A. Dykes D.D. Polesky H.F. A simple salting-out procedure for extracting DNA from human nucleated cells..Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 16: 1215Crossref Scopus (17845) Google Scholar). ApoE genotyping was performed by PCR and restriction digestion analysis by microplate array diagonal gel electrophoresis as previously described (21Bolla M.K. Haddad L. Humphries S.E. Winder A.F. Day I.N.M. A method for the rapid determination of hundreds of apoE genotypes, combining simplified, optimised protocols from sample acquisition to PCR and restriction digestion analysis by microplate array diagonal gel electrophoresis (MADGE)..Clin. Chem. 1995; 4: 1599-1604Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The results for plasma lipids and LPL gene expression are based on 51 subjects who provided tissue biopsies after both experimental periods. Data on post-heparin LPL (PH-LPL) activity was available on a subset of 36 subjects. Results are expressed as mean ± SD. Normality of data distribution was tested by normal probability plots, and where appropriate, non-parametrically distributed data was log10 transformed for parametric testing (TG, PH-LPL, LPL mRNA). Differences between paired data (fish oil vs. control), were tested by Student's t-test for dependent samples. Differences between categorical variables (e.g., apoE genotypes) were tested by one-way ANOVA. Univariate associations between continuous variables were assessed by Pearson's correlation and product-moment coefficients and simple linear regression. The baseline characteristics for the subjects have been described in our previous report (17Minihane A.M. Khan S. Leigh-Firbank C. Talmud P. Wright J.W. Murphy M.C. Griffin B.A. Williams C.M. ApoE polymorphism and fish oil supplementation in subjects with an atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype..Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1990-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In accordance with the study entry criteria, all subjects expressed moderately raised plasma TG (>1.5 mmol/l), low HDL-C (<1.1 mmol/l), and a predominance of small, dense LDL (>40% or LDL subclass pattern B). Although 11 subjects (22%) could be classified as being clinically obese at baseline (BMI > 30 < 40), all subjects were normo-glycemic and normo-insulinemic on entry. This ALP group showed a significantly higher carrier frequency of the apoE4 polymorphism (41% carriers of the ε4 allele) as compared with the UK population (15–25%). Anthropometric variables including weight, BMI, and waist to hip ratio showed no significant change at the end of each intervention period (data not shown). The fish oil and control (olive oil) supplements were well tolerated, and compliance, as measured by capsule count and platelet fatty acid profile, was excellent. There was no evidence of any crossover effects or treatment-by-period interactions. The lipid and lipoprotein response to fish oil in this group has been reported elsewhere (17Minihane A.M. Khan S. Leigh-Firbank C. Talmud P. Wright J.W. Murphy M.C. Griffin B.A. Williams C.M. ApoE polymorphism and fish oil supplementation in subjects with an atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype..Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1990-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). All data shown herein, with the notable exception of the PH-LPL activities, relates to a cohort of 51 subjects. Fish oil supplementation produced a consistent decrease in fasting plasma TG (−26%, P < 0.001) and a marked decrease in the concentration of postprandial plasma TG (Table 1).TABLE 1.Plasma triglyceride area and incremental areaTotal Group (n = 51)Apoε4 (n = 21)Non-ε4 (n = 30)ControlFish OilControlFish OilControlFish OilPlasma TG (mmol/l) (n = 51)2.72 ± 0.822.02 ± 0.71cP ⩽ 0.001 (fish oil vs. control).2.82 ± 1.051.99 ± 0.89bP ⩽ 0.01.2.67 ± 0.692.01 ± 0.58cP ⩽ 0.001 (fish oil vs. control).AUC (mol/l/min) (n = 51)1808 ± 4831389 ± 448cP ⩽ 0.001 (fish oil vs. control).1868 ± 4901413 ± 552cP ⩽ 0.001 (fish oil vs. control).1777 ± 5001369 ± 384cP ⩽ 0.001 (fish oil vs. control).IAUC (mmol/l/min (n = 51)522 ± 236437 ± 193bP ⩽ 0.01.540 ± 203469 ± 201510 ± 262424 ± 187aP ⩽ 0.05.Plasma LPL 5 min (μmols oleate/ml/h) (n = 36)2.34 ± 1.663.06 ± 2.36aP ⩽ 0.05.2.74 ± 2.104.44 ± 2.772.05 ± 1.352.32 ± 1.86Plasma LPL 15 min (μmols oleate/ml/h) (n = 36)4.67 ± 2.605.26 ± 3.485.31 ± 3.136.42 ± 4.034.21 ± 2.244.48 ± 3.02LPL mRNA (No. molecules mRNA LPL/β2-microglobulin) (n = 51)0.255 ± 0.3460.396 ± 0.367bP ⩽ 0.01.0.127 ± 0.0730.373 ± 0.313cP ⩽ 0.001 (fish oil vs. control).0.337 ± 0.4390.399 ± 0.426Plasma triglyceride (TG) (fasted) area and incremental area under the postprandial TG curve (AUC and IAUC), postheparin lipoprotein lipase activity (5 min and 15 min), and adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase mRNA in total group and carriers (apoε4) and non-carriers (non-ε4) of the apoε4 allele.

Griffin B.A. Williams C.M. ApoE polymorphism and fish oil supplementation in subjects with an atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype..Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1990-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Briefly, fish oil supplementation increased the concentration of LC n-3 PUFA [eicosapentaenoic (EPA C20:5) and docosahexaenoic (DHA C22:6)] acids in platelet membranes relative to the control. Total LC n-3 PUFA increased by 88% (P < 0.001), while the ratio of n-6 to LC n-3 PUFA in platelet membrane phospholipids decreased by 53% (9 to 4.2). Post-heparin plasma (PH) was obtained from a subgroup of 36 subjects for the measurement of LPL activity at the end of the fish oil and control phases. PH-LPL activity at 5 min showed an overall increase (+31%, P < 0.036) in response to fish oil supplementation relative to the control (Table 1). At 15 min, PH-LPL activities were higher than at 5 min, but the difference between treatment groups (13%) was no longer significant. The group showed an overall increase (+54%, P = 0.003) in the concentration of AT-LPL mRNA after fish oil relative to the control (Table 1). At the end of the control period, the concentration of AT-LPL mRNA was negatively correlated (r = −0.41, P = 0.003) with the extent of postprandial lipemia (IAUC) (Fig. 1A). There was a weak univariate correlation (r = 0.33, P = 0.05) between the changes (fish oil and control) in PH-LPL activity and concentration of AT-LPL mRNA (Fig. 1B). There was no relationship between PH-LPL activity and fasting TG, or any measure of the extent of postprandial lipemia after either intervention period. As shown previously (17Minihane A.M. Khan S. Leigh-Firbank C. Talmud P. Wright J.W. Murphy M.C. Griffin B.A. Williams C.M. ApoE polymorphism and fish oil supplementation in subjects with an atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype..Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1990-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), the distribution of individual alleles for the apoE polymorphism (ε2, ε3, ε4) in this group of ALP subjects was atypical for a free-living population, with 41% of the group being either heterozygous (ε3/ε4 or ε2/ε4) or homozygous (ε4/ε4) for the apoE4 genotype. There were no homozygotes for apoE2 genotype (ε2/ε2). Of the remaining 30 subjects, 22 were homozygous for the apoE3 genotype (ε3/ε3), with the remaining eight individuals being heterozygous for the apoE2 genotype (ε2/ε3). There was evidence that carriers of the apoε4 allele showed a different lipoprotein response to fish oil than non-ε4 carriers (17Minihane A.M. Khan S. Leigh-Firbank C. Talmud P. Wright J.W. Murphy M.C. Griffin B.A. Williams C.M. ApoE polymorphism and fish oil supplementation in subjects with an atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype..Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1990-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For this reason, subjects were classified as either ε4 (n = 21) or non-ε4 (n = 30) carriers. The effect of apoE genotype on the lipid response to fish oil in this group has been reported previously (17Minihane A.M. Khan S. Leigh-Firbank C. Talmud P. Wright J.W. Murphy M.C. Griffin B.A. Williams C.M. ApoE polymorphism and fish oil supplementation in subjects with an atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype..Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1990-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In the present study, despite there being no differences in plasma TG and the extent of postprandial lipemia between ε4 and non-ε4 groups, the overall LPL response to fish oil was due, in the main, to carriers of the ε4 allele who showed a mean increase in PH-LPL activity at 5 min of 62% (P = 0.19), ε4 carriers versus non-ε4 carriers (Table 1 and Fig. 2A). While the level of AT-LPL mRNA increased in all apoE genotypes on fish oil, ε4 carriers showed the most consistent response with nearly a 3-fold increase in gene expression (Table 1 and Fig. 2B, P < 0.001). Inverse correlations were demonstrated between LPL mRNA and the extent of postprandial lipemia in non-ε4 carriers after the control phase (r = −0.44, P < 0.05), and in ε4 carriers after the fish oil phase (r = −0.58, P < 0.01). Conversely, LPL mRNA was positively correlated with PH-LPL activity in ε4 carriers after fish oil (r = 0.59, P < 0.05). The frequency distribution of an ALP in Western, industrialized populations may parallel that of insulin resistance (22Després J.P. Marette A. Relation of components of insulin resistance syndrome to coronary heart disease risk..Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 274-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although this dyslipidemia may have a mixed etiology, it is likely to represent the most common source of lipid-mediated CHD risk among free-living and otherwise healthy individuals. Fish oil can ameliorate the lipid abnormalities associated with this condition by suppressing the overproduction of TG in the liver and reducing the extent of postprandial lipemia (7Harris W.S. Connor W.E. Alam N. Illingworth D.R. Reduction of postprandial triglyceridemia in humans by dietary n-3 fatty acids..J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1451-1460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study sought to provide further evidence for the latter mechanism, and to ascertain the molecular basis of this effect with focus on the LPL pathway. Since adipose tissue represents an important depository site of postprandial lipid, this was chosen as a metabolically appropriate and practically accessible tissue for this investigation. Subnormal PH-LPL activity has been implicated as a possible cause of enhanced postprandial lipemia in insulin resistant states (23Knudsen P. Eriksson J. Lahdenpera S. Kahri J. Groop L. Taskinen M-R. Changes of lipolytic enzymes cluster with insulin resistance syndrome..Diabetologia. 1995; 38 (the Botnia Study Group): 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Arai T. Yamashita S.

Familial combined hyperlipidemia and abnormal lipoprotein lipase..Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1992; 12: 1176-1183Crossref Google Scholar). Decreased PH-LPL levels have also been reported in a large cohort of individuals with coronary artery disease, and have been linked to adverse changes in plasma lipids and lipoproteins (26Henderson H.E. Kastelein J.J.P. Zwinderman A.H. Gagné E. Jukema J.W. Reymer P.W.A. Groenemeyer B.E. Lie K.I. Bruschke A.V.G. Hayden M.R. Jansen H. Lipoprotein lipase activity is decreased in a large cohort of patients with coronary artery disease and is associated with changes in lipids and lipoproteins..J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the strength of this evidence, it would seem reasonable to expect that activation of the LPL pathway would be beneficial by reversing this lipolytic deficit. However, studies on the effects of fish oil on PH-LPL activity in patients and healthy groups have yielded inconsistent results, due primarily to the indirect nature of the post-heparin measurement. While values for PH-LPL activity obtained in the present study were of a similar magnitude to those reported elsewhere, a direct comparison with published results to establish the relative normality of values in these ALP subjects was not possible due to variations in LPL assay conditions, experimental design (fed vs. fasted states), and the subjects under test. There was a heterogeneous, but overall significant, increase in PH-LPL activity in response to the fish oil, which was greater than that generally reported in the literature. The majority of studies report no effect of fish oil on PH–LPL, and conclude that the TG-lowering arises from a predominant influence in suppressing TG synthesis (27Harris W.S. Fish oils and plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in humans: a critical review..J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 785-807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kendrick J.S. Higgins J.A.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 504-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, increases in LPL activity in response to fish oil have been found in pre and post-heparin plasma (9Harris W.S. Lu G. Rambjor G.S. Walen A.I. Ontko J.A. Chang Q. Windsor S.L. Influence of n-3 fatty acid supplementation on the endogenous activities of plasma lipases..Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1997; 66: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 29Zampelas A. Morgan L.M. Murphy M.C. Williams C.M. Effects of dietary fatty acid composition on postprandial insulin, GIP and lipoprotein lipase activity..Eur. J. Clin. Nutr. 1994; 48: 26-34Google Scholar), though the exact relationship between these measurements is unclear. In view of the role of LPL as a rate-limiting determinant of TG removal in the plasma compartment, it was reasonable to expect an inverse relationship between PH-LPL activity and plasma TG, though the present data provide little evidence to support such a relationship. Post-heparin LPL activity in plasma at 5 min and 15 min is believed to represent a submaximal and maximal release of LPL respectively from the endothelium of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, the relative activities of which will vary with time, previous nutrition, and the general physiological state of the individual. This variation may explain why metabolic relationships between PH-LPL and plasma lipids are not more apparent. Of the two tissue sites, skeletal muscle has received considerably more attention as the most abundant source of LPL and modulator of plasma TG and lipoprotein composition in response to exercise and TG-lowering drugs (30Kiens B.

Postprandial lipemia, Fenofibrate and coronary artery disease..Atherosclerosis. 1990; 85: 193-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, with few exceptions the majority of reported work has focused on lipid metabolism in the post-absorptive state, and takes no account of postprandial events in adipose tissue that may be of paramount importance to the impact of dietary fatty acids on the excursion of TG in the postprandial period. Although LPL activity specific to adipose tissue was not determined in the present study, it is reasonable to expect that this measure would be more closely associated with changes in postprandial lipemia and AT-LPL gene expression. While dietary LC n-3 PUFA are perhaps the most favored nutrients to modulate pre and post-translational events (5Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. Regulation of gene expression by dietary fatty acids..Ann. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 64-83Crossref Scopus (546) Google Scholar), evidence for their effects on LPL gene expression in vivo in human tissues is lacking. This study set out to substantiate earlier findings from our laboratory that showed positive effects of fish oil on the pre-translational regulation of LPL gene expression in the epididymal fat-pads of rats (12Murphy M.C. Zampelas A. Puddicombe S.M. Furlonger N.P. Morgan L.M. Williams C.M. Pre-translational regulation of the expression of the lipoprotein lipase (EC 3.1.1.34) gene by dietary fatty acids in the rat..Br. J. Nutr. 1993; 70: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In a follow-up study on a small group of normal, healthy male subjects (n = 6), the level of AT-LPL mRNA was shown to increase in four out of six subjects in response to fish oil (13Murphy M.C. Brooks C.N. Rockett J.C. Chapman C. Lovegrove J.A. Gould B.J. Wright J.W. Williams C.M. The quantitation of lipoprotein lipase mRNA in biopsies of human adipose tissue, using the polymerase chain reaction, and the effect of increased consumption of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids..Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 53: 441-447Google Scholar). Furthermore, changes in the level of AT-LPL mRNA were inversely associated with changes in fasting plasma TG and postprandial lipemia (AUC), suggesting that LPL gene expression may control longer-term changes in the handling of exogenous and endogenous TG. In the present study, the level of LPL mRNA increased by 54% on fish oil relative to the olive oil control. There are no other studies with a similar experimental design or with equivalent statistical power to match or corroborate these findings. In a recent study, Luo et al. (14Luo J. Salwa W.R. Vidal H. Oppert J-M. Colas C. Guerre-Millo M. Chapuis A-S. Chevalier A. Durand G. Slama G. Moderate intake of n-3 fatty acids for 2 months has no detrimental effect on glucose metabolism and could ameliorate the lipid profile of type 2 diabetic men..Diabetes Care. 1998; 21: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) reported an increase in the level of LPL mRNA in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue in a small group of type II diabetics (n = 5) after 2 months of supplementation with fish oil relative to sunflower oil (6 g fish oil/day equivalent to 1.8 g LC n-3 PUFA). Beyond this, evidence for the effects of LC n-3 PUFA on AT-LPL mRNA levels derives entirely from cell culture studies and animal models, the results of which are equivocal, possibly because the effects are specific to intact adipose tissue (34Zechner R. The tissue-specific expression of lipoprotein lipase: implications for energy and lipoprotein metabolism..Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Experiments on isolated adipocytes indicate that while dietary fatty acids can influence pre-translational events, their effects on post-translational activation of LPL appear to be a more important mechanism of regulation in adipose tissue (35Eberbeck S. Gimble J.M. Lipoprotein lipase gene expression: physiological regulators at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level..Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 107-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 36Amri E-Z. Teboul L. Vannier C. Grimaldi P-A. Ailhaud G.

Olivercrona T. Two different mechanisms are involved in nutritional regulation of lipoprotein lipase in guinea-pig adipose tissue..Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In complete agreement with our earlier observations, the level of AT-LPL mRNA ex vivo from humans was inversely related to the incremental area under the postprandial curve after the control period (Fig. 1A). In addition, the change in gene expression (fish oil vs. control) was positively related to the change in PH-LPL activity (Fig. 1B). Although these relationships could be viewed as somewhat remarkable given that, under certain circumstances, up to 50% of newly synthesized LPL is not actually secreted but degraded in adipocytes (38Braun E.A. Severson D.L. Regulation of the synthesis, processing and translocation of lipoprotein lipase..Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), they do imply that dietary LC n-3 PUFA influences LPL activity and plasma TG in the longer term through regulation of pre-translational events. In the present study, the response of both PH-LPL and AT-LPL mRNA to fish-oil was related to apoE genotype. The reasons why ε4 carriers should express relatively lower PH-LPL activity and levels of AT-LPL message than non-ε4 carriers, and the mechanisms by which LC n-3 PUFA in fish oil may exert selective effects in this group are currently unknown and worthy of further investigation. In conclusion, this study presents evidence to suggest that dietary LC n-3 PUFAs in fish-oil increase AT-LPL gene expression and PH-LPL activity. These effects may be modulated by the apoE polymorphism and could contribute to the correction of lipid abnormalities associated with the ALP.

https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13487,"Sexual dimorphism driven by intersexual resource competition: Why is it rare, and where to look for it?","Abstract Sexes often differ more obviously in secondary sexual characteristics than in traits that appear naturally selected, despite conceivable benefits to intersexual niche partitioning. Genetic constraints may play a role in limiting sex‐specific niche evolution; however, it is not clear why this limit should apply to naturally selected traits more than those under sexual selection; the latter routinely produces dimorphism. We ask whether ecological factors and/or features of the mating system limit dimorphism in resource use, or conversely, what conditions are the most permissible ones for sexual niche differences. The scale of mating competition and spatial variation in resource availability can help predict sexually dimorphic niches or the lack thereof. We investigate why and when dimorphism might fail to evolve even if genetic covariation between the sexes posed no constraint. Our analytical model incorporates the first aspect of spatial interactions (scale of mating competition). It is followed by simulations that explore broader conditions, including multiple resources with habitat heterogeneity, genetic correlations and non‐Gaussian resource‐use efficiency functions. We recover earlier known conditions for favourable conditions for the evolution of niche partitioning between sexes, such as narrow individual niche and low degrees of genetic constraint. We also show spatial considerations to alter this picture. Sexual niche divergence occurs more readily when local mating groups are small and different resources occur reliably across habitats. Polygyny (medium‐sized or large mating groups) can diminish the prospects for dimorphism even if no genetic constraints are present. Habitat heterogeneity typically also disfavours niche dimorphism but can also lead to polymorphism within a sex, if it is beneficial to specialize to be very competitive in one habitat, even at a cost to performance in the other. Sexual conflict is usually used to explain dimorphic traits or behaviours. Our models highlight that introducing conflict (achieved by switching from monogamy to polygamy) can also be responsible for sexual monomorphism. Under monogamy, males benefit from specializing to consume other resources than what feeds the female best. Polygyny makes males disregard this female benefit, and both sexes compete for the most profitable resource, leading to overlapping niches.",W3136491780,False,0.49721667170524597
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13039,Functional traits in agroecology: Advancing description and prediction in agroecosystems,"Agricultural expansion and intensification are contributing to the world's most pressing environmental issues including global climatic change, widespread depletion and contamination of soil and water resources, major disruptions in the Earth's biogeochemical cycles and rates of species extinctions that are conspicuous on geological time-scales (Burney, Davis, & Lobell, 2010; Foley et al., 2005, 2011; Vitousek et al., 1997). Additionally, dominant models of agricultural production—largely envisioned as intensively managed monocultures—have resulted in widespread financial indebtedness of farmers, declining farmer autonomy in management decision-making, and the loss of crop genetic resources (Olson, Morris, & Mendez, 2012; Tomich et al., 2011). Paradoxically as well, while intensive industrial agriculture has increased food production rates to levels that are unprecedented in human history, they have ultimately resulted in pervasive reductions in global food security and sovereignty (Altieri & Toledo, 2011) to the extent that issues of food production, distribution and nutrition occupy a central role in the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs; Pérez-Escamilla, 2017). Agroecology as a scientific discipline, an on-farm practice, and a social or political movement is gaining momentum as a contemporary lens to critique, evaluate and manage the myriad of global socio-economic and environmental issues surrounding food production (Mendez, Bacon, & Cohen, 2013). As a biophysical science, agroecology merges ecology, global change science, plant biology and soil science in order to address many of the most pressing issues of our time including food security, biodiversity loss and climate change (Altieri, 1999; Altieri, Nicholls, Henao, & Lana, 2015; Lin, 2011; Tomich et al., 2011; Tscharntke et al., 2012). But while agroecology is well positioned to address many of these pressing global issues, the science of agroecology lacks a theoretical framework that allows for the development and testing of generalizable hypotheses; especially those that are broadly relevant for farm-scale agricultural management, regional-level land-use planning or international environmental policy. Agroecological research based on a plant functional trait approach may provide such a generalizable framework. In the late 1970s through the 1990s, ecologists began to argue that differences in ecological strategies among plants represent the basis for explaining and predicting individual-, species- and ecosystem-level responses to environmental change (Bazzaz, 1979; Bazzaz & Carlson, 1982; Givnish, 1988; Grime, 1977, 1979, 1988; Lambers & Poorter, 1992; Reich, Walters, & Ellsworth, 1992; Westoby, 1998; Westoby, Falster, Moles, Vesk, & Wright, 2002). While such studies took a number of different approaches—e.g. the ""competition, stress, disturbance"" (CSR) theory (Grime, 1977, 1988), or ""early-, mid- and late-successional species"" classification schemes (e.g. Bazzaz, 1979)—such studies were broadly similar in that they focused on identifying a small number of functional types that could be used to categorize the ecological differences among a large number of plant species. In the 2000s, plant ecologists began to refine these ideas, by evaluating the ecologically meaningful characteristics of plants and plant parts—or the functional traits—which both (1) quantitatively differentiate species from one another along axes of ecological differences and/or functional biology (Reich et al., 1999; Westoby, 1998; Westoby et al., 2002; Wright et al., 2004, 2005), and (2) are most important in mechanistically predicting plant responses to, and impacts on, surrounding environments (Lavorel & Garnier, 2002). Thanks in part to the immense amount of species' trait data that emerged in the early 2000s (e.g. Wright et al., 2004), which has since been consolidated into massive trait databases (e.g. Kattge et al., 2011), studies differentiating trait-based ecological strategies have now come to encapsulate thousands of plant species (Diaz et al., 2016), and a global understanding of relationships between ecosystem processes and plant functional biology is being defined and refined (Diaz et al., 2004). On the basis of this rich history of theoretical and empirical research, over the past 30 years, trait-based ecology has emerged as one of the dominant paradigms in terrestrial ecology, and the theory and principles of trait-based ecology are now widely used to evaluate a remarkable range of questions and hypotheses in global change biology (e.g. Garnier, Navas, & Grigulis, 2016). From an applied perspective, trait-based ecology has more recently been embraced as a critical means by which scientists can test hypotheses on, and recommend management of, managed terrestrial ecosystems (e.g. Cadotte, 2011 and references therein). The transition of trait-based ecology into resource management fields was facilitated by clear empirical evidence that plant functional traits, and functional trait diversity are strong mechanistic predictors of ecosystem functioning (Cadotte, Cavender-Bares, Tilman, & Oakley, 2009; reviewed by Garnier et al., 2016). Scientists are now adopting trait-based approaches to research in many applied fields including restoration ecology (e.g. Funk, Cleland, Suding, & Zavaleta, 2008; Laughlin, 2014), urban ecology (Duncan et al., 2011) and more recently, agroecology (Garnier & Navas, 2012; Martin & Isaac, 2015; Milla, Osborne, Turcotte, & Violle, 2015; Wood et al., 2015). Opinions that trait-based ecology might be efficacious in addressing major questions in agricultural systems first emerged over 5 years ago in a review by Garnier and Navas (2012) that summarized the concepts, tools and applications of functional ecology within agroecology. Then in 2015, three review papers published near-simultaneously (Martin & Isaac, 2015; Milla et al., 2015; Wood et al., 2015) summarized in greater detail the types of broad agroecological questions, hypotheses and management decisions that might be informed by trait-based research. Specifically, these papers reviewed how trait-based ecology could address questions and hypotheses surrounding the ecological consequences of crop breeding (Milla, Morente-Lopez, Alonso-Rodrigo, Martin-Robles, & Chapin, 2014; Milla et al., 2015); how functional traits underpin crop yield and yield models (Gagliardi, Martin, Virginio, Rapidel, & Isaac, 2015); how functional traits influence agricultural nutrient cycling (Garcia-Palacios et al., 2013); and how functional diversity inform an understanding of agricultural contributions to global net primary productivity (Monfreda, Ramankutty, & Foley, 2008). But while these and other examples were drawn from the literature, these review papers (Martin & Isaac, 2015; Milla et al., 2015; Wood et al., 2015) also highlighted the lack of research employing trait-based approaches to test hypotheses on linkages between on-farm diversity and agroecosystem functioning. This lack of research requires some qualification. Plant breeders, crop biologists, agronomists, ecophysiologists and farmers have certainly allocated considerable attention to understanding and selecting for crops that express certain reproductive, leaf, root, phenological and chemical traits (e.g. Meister, Rajani, Ruzicka, & Schachtman, 2014; Meyer, DuVal, & Jensen, 2012). However, this vast amount of scientific and informal on-farm research tends to focus on understanding and managing linkages between only certain functional traits—those forming part of a crop domestication syndrome (Meyer et al., 2012)—and yield. In comparison, trait-based agroecology as envisioned by applied ecologists (Garnier & Navas, 2012; Martin & Isaac, 2015; Milla et al., 2015; Wood et al., 2015), and expanded upon by the research in this Special Feature, seeks to understand how knowledge of the variation in the functional traits and trait diversity of both crop and non-crop species can be used to predict, manage and enhance multiple critical ecosystems functions other than yield alone. Discussing the value and potential application of trait-based agroecology must deal with issues of yield to some degree, as it is the key ecosystem service upon which many livelihoods are predicated. But this Special Feature has a broader goal, in seeking to significantly advance a trait-based understanding of how a wider range of above- and below-ground agroecosystem functions are linked to functional trait diversity among and within both crop and non-crop species. This Special Feature includes seven studies that employ functional trait-based approaches, to frame, test and interpret management-relevant hypotheses in agroecosystems. In doing so, cumulatively these studies provide arguably the single largest empirical and conceptual contribution to a trait-based understanding of agroecological structure and function. Specifically, these studies provide novel insights and evaluations into a wide range of agroecological questions, including how functional trait diversity is driving agricultural nutrient cycles and below-ground processes (Blesh, 2017; Pommier et al., 2017); how knowledge of functional traits can inform the restoration of degraded agricultural land (Lohbeck, Winowiecki, Aynekulu, Okia, & Vågen, 2017); how functional traits can be used to infer the ecological consequences of crop domestication (Roucou et al., 2017); how functional diversity-based approaches can be used to assess nutritional diversity in agricultural systems (Wood, 2017); and lastly, how farmers value, and make management decisions based on, functional traits of crop and non-crop species (Damour, Navas, & Garnier, 2017; Isaac et al., 2017). In this Special Feature, Damour et al. (2017) make a major conceptual contribution to a broader understanding of the potential applications of trait-based agroecology, though a revised ""response/effect"" framework that aids researchers in hypothesizing linkages and feedbacks between plant functional diversity and ecosystem processes (Lavorel & Garnier, 2002). In their revised trait-based response and effect framework, Damour et al. (2017) outline hypotheses on how, and at which stages of management, knowledge of plant functional traits enters into agroecological management prescriptions. Damour et al. (2017) outline a key differentiation that functional diversity in agroecosystems (and in turn rates of agroecosystem service provisioning) is comprised of both planned and spontaneous plant diversity, drawn from a pool of available crop cultivars, and non-crop species (such as weeds) drawn from regional species pool respectively. The processes that result in these different functional diversity components are governed by a set of longer term strategic management decisions, shorter term on-farm tactical decisions, as well as multiple interacting socio-economic and biophysical constraints operating in different farms, regions or landscapes. Damour et al. (2017) then discuss how all of these factors lead to prospective differences in the ""functional profiles"" of the targeted agroecological plant communities (i.e. plant assemblages envisioned by farmers when making management decisions) vs. the realized plant communities (i.e. plant communities actually emerging following interactions between management decisions and the biophysical environment). In hypothesizing a sequence under which these different process occur, as well as the factors governing each stage, Damour et al. (2017) contribute a theoretical framework that can be employed to evaluate multiple linkages between different stages of management, on-farm environmental change, functional trait diversity, and the structure and functioning of agroecosystems. Prior reviews and research in the field of trait-based agroecology have highlighted how intense artificial selection has resulted in major shifts in functional trait syndromes of crops (Martin et al., 2017; Milla et al., 2014, 2015), and how this variation then governs rates of agroecosystem functioning (e.g. Garcia-Palacios et al., 2013). Of all themes addressed in the trait-based agroecology literature to date, this area has arguably the strongest empirical support from studies comparing functional trait syndromes in crops vs. wild ancestors (e.g. Milla et al., 2014). In this Special Feature, Roucou et al. (2017) make a major contribution to the theme of understanding the traits other than those strictly related to yield that have also been selected for during the process of crop domestication. Through a comparative evaluation of above- and below-ground functional trait variation among 40 different accessions of wheat (Triticum turgidum), Roucou et al. (2017) provide strong empirical support for the hypothesis that due to evolutionary constraints in functional trait trade-offs, crop breeding has (likely inadvertently) also selected for suites of traits that favour high rates of resource acquisition. Their contribution is essential in defining a more comprehensive understanding of the ecological consequences of an expanded crop domestication syndrome (cf. Meyer et al., 2012), and presents lines of evidence that support the concept of functional trait-based screening for future crops (Milla et al., 2015). More practically, their research presents novel ideas surrounding how complementary functional trait syndromes can contribute to the ecologically based selection of genotypes for intercropped agroecosystems. In the applied ecology literature, studies that evaluate the complex linkages between functional traits, functional diversity and ecosystem functioning have recently begun to explore concepts surrounding ""multi-functionality"": the idea that multiple ecosystem functions should be considered as a management goal, vs. one or a narrow set of functions (Gamfeldt, Hillebrand, & Jonsson, 2008). The concept of multi-functionality has clear implications for trait-based agroecology, where managers may manipulate on-farm diversity to enhance certain ecosystem services beyond yield alone, or alternatively, minimize the net-negative trade-offs that might occur among ecosystem functions (Finney & Kaye, 2017; Schipanski et al., 2014). Research by Blesh (2017) addresses this theme by evaluating hypotheses on how functional diversity in temperate North American organic polyculture systems influences multiple agroecosystem functions. Blesh (2017) contributes novel empirical evidence on how the on-farm selection of crops with complementary functional traits, across a gradient of management-relevant environmental conditions, enhances the multi-functionality of agroecosystems including biological nitrogen (N) fixation (BNF), soil N retention and weed suppression. Blesh (2017) also contributes an important conceptual advancement to applied trait-based ecology, through a more detailed discussion on BNF in functional ecology. On the one hand, trait-based studies commonly view the ability to fix atmospheric N as a binary functional trait, most widely observed in plants in the Fabaceae family (Perez-Harguindeguy et al., 2013); however, Blesh (2017) points to the fact that in agroecosystems, quantitative rates of BNF should be viewed as a key ecosystem function. The work of Blesh (2017) therefore indicates that certain conventions in trait-based ecology surrounding how plant functional traits are defined need to be revisited when applied in agroecological contexts. From a management perspective, Blesh (2017) makes an important contribution to understanding how inter- and intraspecific trait variation across environmental gradients and management systems plays a key role in mediating relationships between functional diversity on agroecosystem functioning. Of all the potential applications of trait-based agroecology, understanding how traits mediate multiple ecological interactions that impact different aspects of nutrient cycles is arguably of the highest importance to farmers and land managers. At the same time, a key theme at the leading edge of trait-based ecology is better understanding how to characterize the diversity and role of functional traits in microbial species (Green, Bohannan, & Whitaker, 2008). Pommier et al. (2017) address both of these themes, by offering a robust example of how a functional trait-based approach provides new insights into our understanding and prediction of linkages between microbial diversity and nutrient cycles. Pommier et al. (2017) distil trait-mediated interactions among plant and microbial species that affect nitrogen (N) dynamics in European-managed grasslands agroecosystems, showing that variation in nitrate and ammonium leaching and soil organic matter content is largely explained by microbial traits including the maximum rate of nitrification and fungi: bacteria ratios. To date, this contribution by Pommier et al. (2017) is among very few studies that incorporate diversity of microbial traits with soil and plant metrics, representing an important advancement in the understanding of microbial-controlled ecosystem services in agroecosystems. Agricultural abandonment has also emerged as a major global socio-economic and land-use trend, with major implications for human well-being, global economic systems and the Earth's biophysical environment. In turn, restoration of agricultural lands is now emerging as both a challenge and opportunity for conservation biology (e.g. Queiroz, Beilin, Folke, & Lindborg, 2014), climate change mitigation (e.g. Pan et al., 2011) and the revitalization of other ecological processes such as nutrient cycling (e.g. Knops & Tilman, 2000). Trait-based approaches to the planning and managing of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in abandoned agricultural lands represent a major emerging vanguard for policymakers and practitioners. In this Special Feature, Lohbeck et al. (2017) provide empirical evidence on how plant functional traits and trait diversity is linked with the restoration of ecosystem functions in degraded agricultural lands. Lohbeck et al. (2017) show that enhancement of functional diversity in degraded East African agroecosystems is positively associated with key parameters of soil remediation including increased organic carbon stocks and decreased soil erosion, while the abundance of invasive species is negatively associated with these parameters. Lohbeck et al. (2017) then suggest that strategies for restoring degraded agricultural land should be informed by principles of functional ecology, with concrete policy- and practice-relevant suggestions that include farmer-lead tree selection during restoration processes. While the conceptual (Damour et al., 2017) and empirical (Blesh, 2017; Lohbeck et al., 2017; Pommier et al., 2017; Roucou et al., 2017) studies in this Special Feature address major gaps in the scientific literature of agroecology, there remains an major ""elephant in the trait-based agroecology room"": do farmers and policymakers base their decisions on the same traits that ecologists consider vital to ecosystem functioning? Earlier papers have summarized the scant evidence that farmers make decisions based on functional ecology prioritized traits (Martin & Isaac, 2015). But here, Isaac et al. (2017) tackle this challenging theme directly by analysing farmer perceptions on how variation in the leaf economics traits of coffee (Coffea arabica) influence the management and understanding of agroecosystem functions. Through in-depth interviews and surveys, coupled with a visual elicitation tool dubbed ""the leaf book,"" Isaac et al. (2017) show that farmers diagnose major management concerns based on, and adjust their practices at least in part according to, intraspecific variation in leaf economics traits. This research represents a major contribution to the literature on how farmers employ an understanding of plant functional traits other than yield alone to manage agroecological systems. From a wider ecological perspective, this research stands as the first to extend a major theme in the functional ecology literature—the concept of trait trade-offs and spectra (Wright et al., 2004)—into the sphere of local ecological knowledge. In theorizing the presence of a ""Farmer Economics Spectrum,"" Isaac et al. (2017) contribute a conceptual advancement through their hypothesis that land managers acknowledge and make decisions based on the trait trade-offs that underpin inter- and intraspecific variation in plant functional biology. Wood (2017) also addresses the policy relevance of functional trait-based agroecology, through a novel empirical analysis that extends methods in functional ecology—namely functional diversity metrics—into the realm of human nutrition. Broadly, Wood (2017) presents arguments that trait-based agroecology must focus beyond the traits that mediate biophysical interactions, and instead also consider traits that are empirically linked with human well-being or other social aspects of agroecosystems. Wood (2017) then illustrates the value of this concept, by employing principles of functional trait diversity to derive a new nutritional diversity metric: potential nutritional adequacy (PNA). This metric represents a major advance in how plant functional trait diversity can be empirically linked with the nutritional outcomes associated with enhancing on-farm diversity. In his application of this new metric using data from Senegal, Wood (2017) shows that neither intensification nor diversification represent a singular approach to increasing PNA in small-holder agroecosystems; this represents a more measured and policy-realistic approach to addressing questions of food security, as compared to arguments that fall on one side of the ""intensification vs. extensification"" debate (Foley et al., 2011). Wood (2017) then proposes that PNA could be paired with other indicators of environmental outcomes as a means to assess the joint benefits of, or prospective trade-offs among, the provisioning of food security, food sovereignty and other ecosystem services in agroecosystems. The research in this Special Feature demonstrates how a functional trait-based approach represents meaningful advances in integrating leading edge ecological sciences into an understanding of the linkages between agricultural diversity and agroecosystem functioning. The papers here address themes in agriculture that span from genetic to regional scales of investigation. Taken as a whole, we hope that they represent at least a small step in having trait-based agroecology contribute to the sustainable management of agricultural systems, the restoration of degraded agricultural lands, the understanding of the crop nutrition-food security nexus and the overall enhancement of agroecosystem functioning. Based on the empirical and conceptual advances put forth in this Special Feature, clearly there is a role for a trait-based approach to agroecology in guiding the composition and function of sustainable agroecosystems. Contemporary sustainable agriculture is more relevant than ever, particularly under the United Nations SDGs launched in 2015: 17 global goals with 169 total targets, designed to frame a global sustainable development agenda through the year 2030. Generally, the SDGs fall into the two primary realms: socio-economic development such as human health, education, social justice and inequality, and environmental sustainability including clean water provisioning, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and terrestrial and aquatic resource conservation. Many of the SDGs straddle this broad divide, perhaps no more than SDG 2 that calls for ""End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture."" This SDG, which entails targets surrounding agricultural production and sustainability, provides a clear opportunity for trait-based agroecology to inform a better understanding of the types of farming systems that can move towards meeting these targets. For instance, SDG 2 Target 2.4 calls for the implementation of ""…resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters, and that progressively improve land and soil quality."" Sustainable Development Goal 2 Target 2.5 calls for the maintenance of a ""…genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants, farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks."" If not explicitly, the promise of trait-based agroecology is well-encapsulated by language within the SDGs that indicates a strong role for agroecology (and applied ecology more broadly) in helping to address some of the world's most pressing socio-economic and environmental concerns. In agriculture broadly, the realized and potential impacts of climate change, depletion of soil resources, as well as the loss of crop and non-crop diversity, require new approaches to frame, test and prescribe management for resilient agroecosystems. Trait-based ecology has advanced our understanding of the causes and consequences of shifts in ecological functioning of natural ecosystems, and based on the research in this Special Feature, represents a novel means of advancing our understanding of agroecosystem structure, function and performance. Most importantly, as this Special Feature demonstrates, trait-based approaches can play a key role in diagnosing crop–environment interactions, predicting crop and non-crop interactions, understanding future impacts of crop domestication and, ultimately, prescribing ecologically sound and sustainable management practices.

https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2009.00745.x,A new hypothesis for the functional role of diversity in mediating resource pools and weed–crop competition in agroecosystems,"S mith RG, M ortensen DA &amp; R yan MR (2009). A new hypothesis for the functional role of diversity in mediating resource pools and weed–crop competition in agroecosystems. Weed Research. 50, 37–48. Summary We develop a new conceptual model we call the Resource Pool Diversity Hypothesis (RPDH) aimed at explaining how soil resource pool diversity may mediate competition for soil resources between weeds and crops. The primary tenets of the RPDH are that (i) in plant communities, the intensity of inter‐specific competition can depend upon the degree to which niche differentiation and resource partitioning occur among species, (ii) agricultural systems are unique in that management practices, such as crop rotation, source of fertility and weed management, result in inputs to the soil and (iii) these inputs directly or indirectly become soil resource pools from which crops and weeds may partition resources. The RPDH leads to the novel prediction that along a gradient of increasing cropping system diversity, yield loss due to weed–crop competition (i.e. the impact on yield per unit weed density) for soil resources should decrease. Similarly, the degree to which crops and weeds overlap in soil resource niche breadth (which is determined by species‐specific functional traits for resource acquisition), will determine the extent to which weed–crop competition weakens as resource pool diversity increases. While there have been no direct tests of the RPDH, we highlight evidence from the agricultural literature that provides strong support for components of the hypothesis. Validation of the RPDH would have important implications across a broad range of cropping systems for the development of management strategies that aim to reduce yield loss impact per unit weed plant density and the fundamental principles of integrated weed management, such as the concepts of weed thresholds and critical periods.",W1972291563,False,0.5443236231803894
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13676,Herbivory of a biocontrol agent on a native plant causes an indirect trait‐mediated non‐target effect on a native insect,"Abstract Identifying food web linkages between biocontrol agents of invasive plants and native species is crucial for predicting indirect non‐target effects. Biocontrol insects can integrate into food webs within recipient habitats and influence native insects through apparent competition (altering shared natural enemies) or density‐mediated exploitation competition (changing density of native plants). However, whether and how trait‐mediated exploitation competition (modifying native plant chemicals and volatiles profiles) can produce indirect non‐target effects remains largely overlooked, despite plant phenotypic responses to insect herbivory being common and widely documented. The flea beetle Agasicles hygrophila was introduced into China for management of alligator weed Alternanthera philoxeroides, but it also attacks the native congener sessile joyweed Alternanthera sessilis, which may cause indirect non‐target effects on the native tortoise beetle Cassida piperata that also feeds on sessile joyweed. Here, we examined the relationships among abundances of the flea beetle and tortoise beetle, and coverage of sessile joyweed in the field. Then, we investigated the impact of flea beetle herbivory on tortoise beetle development and oviposition, as well as on sessile joyweed primary metabolites and leaf volatiles. Tortoise beetle abundance was not related to sessile joyweed coverage, but they were less abundant on plants with more flea beetles in the field survey, and produced fewer offspring on plants with more prior flea beetle damage in the field cage experiment. Tortoise beetle development was inhibited by prior flea beetle herbivory in bioassays in enemy‐free conditions and they preferred to oviposit on sessile joyweed that had experienced little or no flea beetle damage. Flea beetle herbivory decreased sessile joyweed foliar glucose and protein, and substantially changed its leaf volatile blend. Synthesis. Our results show that the flea beetle has major indirect non‐target effects on the tortoise beetle through trait‐mediated exploitation competition, rather than apparent competition or density‐mediated exploitation competition. Our results demonstrate a new example for indirect non‐target effects of biocontrol agents. Furthermore, our results indicate that minor brief negative impacts of biocontrol agents on non‐target plants might propagate to higher trophic levels and such negative impacts can strengthen with increasing intensity of the direct non‐target effect.",W3159289210,False,0.7888161540031433
https://doi.org/10.2307/1564855,Effects of Egg Size and Density on Metamorphic Traits in Tadpoles of the Natterjack Toad (Bufo calamita),"-We examined whether intrapopulational variation in egg size was correlated with developmental rates and metamorphic traits of natterjack toads (Bufo calamita) grown at different experimental densities. Mean egg size of siblings was positively correlated with both mean size of hatchlings at the initiation of feeding and mean developmental rates to the feeding stage. However, size at and survival to metamorphosis were not related to ovum or hatchling size. At high densities tadpoles had slower growth rates, longer larval periods, and lower survival, and were smaller at metamorphosis. Length of larval period was inversely related to early tadpole growth rate for all densities. Mass at metamorphosis was positively correlated to tadpole growth rate, except at high densities. Size at metamorphosis was inversely related to length of larval period at low densities, but relationships were inconsistent at higher densities. Egg size in amphibians has been viewed as a resource tradeoff for females with limited energy for reproduction. This notion is derived in part from optimality models predicting that for each environment there is an optimal offspring size (Smith and Fretwell, 1974; Brockelman, 1975). Others have suggested that optimality theory is contradicted by the high degree of intraclutch egg size variability observed in amphibians (Kaplan, 1980; Crump, 1981). Egg size variability may be adaptive in unpredictable environments such as temporary ponds where the intensity of competition may vary annually. Larvae from larger eggs would be favored in competitive environments due to their initial size advantage, while in noncompetitive environments larger and smaller hatchlings would be equally successful. By producing eggs of mixed sizes females may increase their fitness relative to those following a pure strat146 This content downloaded from 207.46.13.57 on Fri, 09 Sep 2016 04:31:37 UTC All use subject to METAMORPHOSIS IN NATTERJACK TOADS egy (Crump, 1984; Kaplan and Cooper, 1984). This reasoning assumes a positive correlation between egg size and larval fitness in competitive environments. Hence, under this view the covariation is environmentally mediated, and the effect of egg size on larval fitness should be related to population density or food availability (Kaplan, 1985; Berven and Chadra, 1988). In temporary ponds, the length of larval period may be an important fitness component because it is inversely related to larval survival. In some amphibians, individuals that grow relatively fast metamorphose earlier (Wilbur and Collins, 1973; Collins, 1979; Smith-Gill and Berven, 1979; Travis, 1981, 1983, 1984) and may be less susceptible to size-selective predators (Heyer et al., 1975; Brodie and Formanowicz, 1983). Further, time to and size at metamorphosis may have strong ecological implications related to long-term fitness since both can affect juvenile survival, age at first reproduction, or level of adult fecundity (Smith, 1987; Semlitsch et al., 1988; Berven, 1990). The relationship between these two traits is controlled largely by the environment (Travis, 1984), and may vary in consistency and direction. A gradual drop in water temperature during a cohort's development may produce a positive covariation between traits (Smith-Gill and Berven, 1979). Likewise, covariation may result from competitive release as fast-growing tadpoles undergo metamorphosis and leave the pond. Remaining tadpoles may then have higher growth rates as a result of an increase in the per capita food ration (Collins, 1979). Negative or random covariations may be the result of an environmental decline in per capita food level that is not counterbalanced by competitive release of metamorphs (Alford and Harris, 1988). It also may be the result of heterogeneous environmental effects (Travis, 1984). The natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) breeds in temporary ponds, and is often the only amphibian species present. Tadpole developmental time is short and may last less than 30 d. However, under crowded conditions individuals may extend their larval development up to 80 d. This implies a greater mortality and total absence of metamorphic success in dry years (Tejedo, 1992a); hence, faster growth rate may be highly adaptive. Much variation in egg size exists within populations, and this variation is related to female body size (Tejedo, 1992a). In this report we examined in the laboratory the relationships between two maternally induced variables (egg size and early hatchling size) and four fitness traits: size at metamorphosis; time of development; growth rate; and survival. The relationship was assessed for larvae of different sibships from a single population, under a range of density treatments. Moreover, growth trajectories and covariation between body size at metamorphosis and developmental time were analyzed across the different densities. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 41 egg clutches of B. calamita was sampled from a breeding pond at Sierra Morena, C6rdoba, Spain, during January 1988, ca. 12 h after oviposition, and the eggs were between midand late cleavage (stage 8-9; Gosner, 1960) when they were measured. Average egg size was determined by measuring the diameter of 10 randomly-selected eggs from each clutch. For each egg, the diameter was measured to the nearest 0.02 mm with a dissecting microscope and ocular micrometer. From each clutch, we selected 20 eggs within 0.05 mm of the average diameter. These were allowed to develop to Gosner stage 25 (initial feeding phase), at which time the tadpoles were measured and randomly assigned to four experimental densities consisting of either 1 (D1), 2 (D2), 4 (D4), or 8 (D8) individuals per container. Each group of tadpoles was placed in 15 cm diameter plastic pans that contained 250 ml of dechlorinated tap water. The range of experimental densities was similar to that observed in the pond (5-1000 tadpoles/m2; Tejedo, unpubl. data). Tadpoles were fed and the water changed three times per week. Each pan initially received 30 mg of Purina rabbit chow per feeding. Food rations were increased to 70 mg after 30 d of growth. The ration was kept constant throughout the experiment despite the fact that tadpoles in some treatments died or reached metamorphic climax. Food levels at the lower densities (1-2 tadpoles per pan) allowed unlimited growth. However, tadpoles at higher densities (4 and 8 individuals per pan) normally consumed their food by the second and first day after feeding, respectively. The experiment was conducted in laboratory conditions with natural light. Temperature oscillated around 1416 C. We measured snout-to-tail base and total length of tadpoles 15, 30, and 45 d after the start of the experiment. Both length measures minimized handling of tadpoles and were highly correlated with tadpole weight (total length, r2 = 0.801; snout-to-tail base length, r2 = 0.781, n = 53, P",W2324596757,False,0.8655551671981812
https://doi.org/10.1086/707597,Belowground Competition Can Influence the Evolution of Root Traits,"Although root traits play a critical role in mediating plant-plant interactions and resource acquisition from the soil environment, research examining whether and how belowground competition can influence the evolution of root traits remains largely unexplored. Here we examine the possibility that root traits may evolve as a target of selection from interspecific competition using Ipomoea purpurea and I. hederacea, two closely related morning glory species that commonly co-occur in the United States, as a model system. We show that belowground competitive interactions between the two species can alter the pattern of selection on root traits in each species. Specifically, competition with I. purpurea changes the pattern of selection on root angle in I. hederacea, and competitive interactions with I. hederacea change the pattern of selection on root size in I. purpurea. However, we did not uncover evidence that intraspecific competition altered the pattern of selection on any root traits within I. hederacea. Overall, our results suggest that belowground competition between closely related species can influence the phenotypic evolution of root traits in natural populations. Our findings provide a microevolutionary perspective of how competitive belowground interactions may impact plant fitness, potentially leading to patterns of plant community structure.",W2996026402,False,0.8358481526374817
https://doi.org/10.1086/674965,Conflicting Selection in the Course of Adaptive Diversification: The Interplay between Mutualism and Intraspecific Competition,"Adaptive speciation can occur when a population undergoes assortative mating and disruptive selection caused by frequency-dependent intraspecific competition. However, other interactions, such as mutualisms based on trait matching, may generate conflicting selective pressures that constrain species diversification. We used individual-based simulations to explore how different types of mutualism affect adaptive diversification. A magic trait was assumed to simultaneously mediate mate choice, intraspecific competition, and mutualisms. In scenarios of intimate, specialized mutualisms, individuals interact with one or few individual mutualistic partners, and diversification is constrained only if the mutualism is obligate. In other scenarios, increasing numbers of different partners per individual limit diversification by generating stabilizing selection. Stabilizing selection emerges from the greater likelihood of trait mismatches for rare, extreme phenotypes than for common intermediate phenotypes. Constraints on diversification imposed by increased numbers of partners decrease if the trait matching degree has smaller positive effects on fitness. These results hold after the relaxation of various assumptions. When trait matching matters, mutualism-generated stabilizing selection would thus often constrain diversification in obligate mutualisms, such as ant-myrmecophyte associations, and in low-intimacy mutualisms, including plant-seed disperser systems. Hence, different processes, such as trait convergence favoring the incorporation of nonrelated species, are needed to explain the higher richness of low-intimacy assemblages—shown here to be up to 1 order of magnitude richer than high-intimacy systems.",W1981437692,False,0.787079393863678

However, most of them are unaware of their status. This observation suggests that SCT may be asymptomatic and remains a benign condition for daily life activities (5). Indeed, numerous studies have reported that subjects with SCT had normal growth and development, normal morbidity (10) and mortality (21), and finally, normal life expectancy (12). Moreover, in worldwide countries of malarial endemicity, subjects with SCT have been found to be more healthy and able to perform heavy physical labor than subjects without the trait. Our hypothesis that SCT can also be considered asymptomatic and as a benign condition during physical activity is based on five kinds of data.1) Epidemiological studies on large popular sporting events.Of 1,506 black males participating in the first Abidjan semi-marathon, SCT was detected in 123, i.e. 8.7%, a percentage similar to that observed in the general Ivory Coast population (15). Similarly, of 266 Cameroonian runners engaged in the International Mount Cameroon Ascent Race, SCT was found in 33 (12.4%), a prevalence similar to that of the ethnically corrected general population (25). These results suggest that, unlike in patients with symptoms or in an otherwise deleterious condition, there is no selective exclusion of individuals with SCT from participation in sports and physical activities.2) Epidemiological studies on specific sports practitioners.Murphy (16) reported the presence of 39 (6.7%) subjects with SCT among the black football players in the National Football League. Similarly, 15 black high school athletes with SCT (10.5%) were observed by Diggs and Flowers (7). In physical education and sports colleges in Ivory Coast and Cameroon, the prevalence of SCT was reported to be 13.7% and 18.6%, respectively, i.e.. a percentage similar to those observed in the general population of these countries (12% and 17.3%, respectively; Refs. 13, 24). These studies suggest that SCT does not discourage its carriers from practicing high level competitive activities or from engaging themselves in sports-related professions. Moreover, there are subjects with SCT among champions and record holders. Among 129 national Ivory Coast champions or record holders in races during the 1956–1989 period, we found 13 athletes with SCT (10.1%; Ref. 14). Among 122 national Ivory Coast track and field throw and jump champions during the 1956–1995 period, 34 were found to have SCT (27.8%; Ref. 3). These percentages were similar and significantly higher than subjects with SCT in the general population of Ivory Coast. Athletes with SCT participated to the 1968 Mexico Olympic Games, as reported by Pearson (17). These data indicate that athletes with SCT are quite able to perform at the highest level of long-lasting and strenuous training.3) Physical aptitude of subjects with SCT.Aerobic (maximal oxygen uptake and ventilatory threshold; Refs. 18, 27) and anaerobic (maximal anaerobic power; Ref. 2) metabolisms have been found similar in subjects with SCT and in controls with normal hemoglobin. However, blood lactate concentrations ([La]) during incremental exercise remain a controversial issue. Freund et al. (9) reported significantly higher [La] in SCT subjects than in controls. Unfortunately, these subjects exhibited significantly lower hemoglobin level than controls. In contrast, Gozal et al. (11) and Bilé et al. (3) found significant lower [La] in physical education students and sedentary subjects with SCT, respectively. Thiriet et al. (26) reported significantly lower [La] during consecutive anaerobic exercises in physical education SCT students than in controls. Recently, Sara et al. (19) took into account the different bias of the above mentioned studies and measured [La] in the blood compartments of physical education students with SCT during incremental exercise and immediate recovery. They found no significant difference in whole blood, plasma, or red blood cell [La] between SCT carriers and control subjects with normal hemoglobin. Neither the red blood cell/plasma [La] ratio nor the plasma-to-red blood cell lactate gradient differed between groups. Lactate distribution in the blood compartments did not differ between the two groups. These findings suggest that lactate production and/or clearance is quite similar during exercise in subjects with or without SCT. High [La] during exercise are associated with acidosis, which may, in turn, trigger sickle cell crisis. The observation of similar physical aptitude and similar or lower [La] in trained and untrained subjects with SCT during incremental (i.e., mainly aerobic) and anaerobic exercises is a key point to support our hypothesis that SCT should be considered asymptomatic and as a benign condition during physical activity.4) Studies on exercise tolerance in subjects with SCT.The cardiac responses to exercise in children (1) and in men and women with SCT (8) were similar to those of control subjects. Cardiopulmonary and gas exchange responses to acute strenuous exercise at low altitude (1,270 m; Ref. 27), and, at moderate inspiratory hypoxia corresponding to simulated altitude of 2,300 m (28), were found comparable in healthy, black male basic recruits with SCT and in control subjects.5) Follow-up of subjects with SCT engaged in official sports activities and military duty.During two seasons, the football and basketball squads of Melrose High School, which included students with SCT, participated in training programs and in competition without apparent disability that could be ascribed to the SCT (7). Similarly, a prospective and carefully controlled study on the effect of army basic training at an altitude of 1,270 m on SCT subjects failed to report any medical problem that could be directly attributed to SCT (29). Finally, an extensive epidemiological study on the nontraumatic deaths during U.S. armed forces basic training, 1977–2001, revealed that 26 deaths occurred in recruits with SCT. Interestingly, these 26 SCT deaths were all exercise related and due to congenital mitral valve disease, exertional heat illness, and idiopathic sudden death (20). One would thus suggest that none of the recruits with SCT died from a sickle cell crisis, i.e., due to SCT, and that the occurrence of idiopathic sudden death is inconsistent with the presence of symptoms.Overall, SCT has to be reconsidered as a single-hemoglobin gene mutation. This means that subjects with SCT are similar for this gene, but that they may be different for all other hemoglobin genes. SCT associated with alpha-thalassemia is not similar to SCT alone (22). Moreover, subjects with SCT may also be different with regard to all their remaining genes. New technologies in genomics and proteomics are revolutionizing the study of adaptation to environmental stress, particularly the adaptation to hypoxia and exercise (23). Of interest are the recent studies about the gene expression profiles of white blood cells (for the heat shock proteins) and skeletal muscle tissue in response to exercise and training stimuli, both showing many interindividual differences (5, 30). Together, these studies could explain some of the observations—exertional heat illness, training level of recruits—reported by Scoville et al. (20). Knowledge on human globin genes and their polymorphism shows that a mutation happens in a population and spreads because of its selective advantage (6). The HbS mutation occurred in regions of malaria endemicity and appeared to be, per se, asymptomatic and as a benign condition during physical activity. However, the fitness of this single mutation could depend on the genetic background of subjects when the mutation arose (6).The authors are grateful to Professor Michel Dauzat for contribution to the manuscript preparation.REFERENCES1 Alpert BS, Flood NL, Strong WB, Blair JR, Walpert JB, Levy AL.

https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.610,Alternative trait combinations and secondary resource partitioning in sexually selected color polymorphism,"Resource partitioning within a species, trophic polymorphism is hypothesized to evolve by disruptive selection when intraspecific competition for certain resources is severe. However, in this study, we reported the secondary partitioning of oviposition resources without resource competition in the damselfly Ischnura senegalensis. In this species, females show color polymorphism that has been evolved as counteradaptation against sexual conflict. One of the female morphs is a blue-green (andromorph, male-like morph), whereas the other morph is brown (gynomorph). These female morphs showed alternative preferences for oviposition resources (plant tissues); andromorphs used fresh (greenish) plant tissues, whereas gynomorphs used decaying (brownish) plants tissues, suggesting that they chose oviposition resources on which they are more cryptic. In addition, the two-color morphs had different egg morphologies. Andromorphs have smaller and more elongated eggs, which seemed to adapt to hard substrates compared with those of gynomorphs. The resource partitioning in this species is achieved by morphological and behavioral differences between the color morphs that allow them to effectively exploit different resources. Resource partitioning in this system may be a by-product of phenotypic integration with body color that has been sexually selected, suggesting an overlooked mechanism of the evolution of resource partitioning. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary and ecological consequences of such resource partitioning.",W2124526866,False,0.3243767023086548

Using a plant-pollinator system as a model, I tested the prediction the presence of a competitor for pollination influences the strength and/or direction of pollinator-mediated selection on floral traits. I measured phenotypic selection via female fitness on five floral traits of Ipomopsis aggregata in seven populations. Four contained only conspecifics (I only) and three also contained the competitor Castilleja linariaefolia (C I). Directional selection via fruits/plant and conspecific pollen deposited/flower on corolla length was positive and significantly stronger in C I populations. This difference in selection was apparently driven by interpopulation variation in the degree to which reproduction of I. aggregata was pollen limited. Consistent with expectations of interspecific competition, I. aggregata plants in C I populations received less conspecific pollen per flower and set fewer seeds per fruit and fruits per plant than those in I only populations. Ipomopsis aggregata's corollas were also significantly longer in C I populations, suggesting that there had been a response to a similar selective regime in past generations. Phenotypic correlations between corolla length and width, which determine the variation in I. aggregata's flower shape, were significantly weaker in C I populations. These data suggest that competition for pollination can influence the strength of selection on and patterns of correlations among floral traits of I. aggregata. If I. aggregata populations with and without competitors for pollination are linked by gene flow, then measuring selection in competitive and noncompetitive environments maybe necessary to accurately predict how floral traits will evolve.Corresponding Editor: D.

https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.02116,Environmental Nutrient Supply Directly Alters Plant Traits but Indirectly Determines Virus Growth Rate,"Ecological stoichiometry and resource competition theory both predict that nutrient rates and ratios can alter infectious disease dynamics. Pathogens such as viruses hijack nutrient rich host metabolites to complete multiple steps of their epidemiological cycle. As the synthesis of these molecules requires nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), environmental supply rates and ratios of N and P to hosts can directly limit disease dynamics. Environmental nutrient supplies also may alter virus epidemiology indirectly by changing host phenotype or the dynamics of coinfecting pathogens. We tested whether host nutrient supplies and coinfection control pathogen growth within hosts and transmission to new hosts, either directly or through modifications of plant tissue chemistry (i.e. content and stoichiometric ratios of nutrients), host phenotypic traits, or among-pathogen interactions. We examined two widespread plant viruses (BYDV-PAV and CYDV-RPV) in cultivated oats (Avena sativa) grown along a range of N and of P supply rates. N and P supply rates altered plant tissue chemistry and phenotypic traits; however environmental nutrient supplies and plant tissue content and ratios of nutrients did not directly alter virus titer. Infection with CYDV-RPV altered plant traits and resulted in thicker plant leaves (i.e. higher leaf mass per area) and there was a positive correlation between CYDV-RPV titer and leaf mass per area. CYDV-RPV titer was reduced by the presence of a competitor, BYDV-PAV, and higher CYDV-RPV titer led to more severe chlorotic symptoms. In our experimental conditions, virus transmission was unaffected by nutrient supply rates, co-infection, plant stoichiometry, or plant traits, although nutrient supply rates have been shown to increase infection and coinfection rates. This work provides a robust test of the role of plant nutrient content and ratios in the dynamics of globally important pathogens and reveals a more complex relationship between within-host virus growth and alterations of plant traits. A deeper understanding of the differential effects of environmental nutrient supplies on virus epidemiology and ecology is particularly relevant given the rapid increase of nutrients flowing into Earth's ecosystems as a result of human activities.",W2765609484,False,0.8007320761680603
https://doi.org/10.1111/jeb.13222,Evolution of larval competitiveness and associated life‐history traits in response to host shifts in a seed beetle,"Abstract Resource competition is frequently strong among parasites that feed within small discrete resource patches, such as seeds or fruits. The properties of a host can influence the behavioural, morphological and life‐history traits of associated parasites, including traits that mediate competition within the host. For seed parasites, host size may be an especially important determinant of competitive ability. Using the seed beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus, we performed replicated, reciprocal host shifts to examine the role of seed size in determining larval competitiveness and associated traits. Populations ancestrally associated with either a small host (mung bean) or a large one (cowpea) were switched to each other's host for 36 generations. Compared to control lines (those remaining on the ancestral host), lines switched from the small host to the large host evolved greater tolerance of co‐occurring larvae within seeds (indicated by an increase in the frequency of small seeds yielding two adults), smaller egg size and higher fecundity. Each change occurred in the direction predicted by the traits of populations already adapted to cowpea. However, we did not observe the expected decline in adult mass following the shift to the larger host. Moreover, lines switched from the large host (cowpea) to the small host (mung bean) did not evolve the predicted increase in larval competitiveness or egg size, but did exhibit the predicted increase in body mass. Our results thus provide mixed support for the hypothesis that host size determines the evolution of competition‐related traits of seed beetles. Evolutionary responses to the two host shifts were consistent among replicate lines, but the evolution of larval competition was asymmetric, with larval competitiveness evolving as predicted in one direction of host shift, but not the reverse. Nevertheless, our results indicate that switching hosts is sufficient to produce repeatable and rapid changes in the competition strategy and fitness‐related traits of insect populations.",W2773032550,False,0.7984755635261536
https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m208107200,Regulation of 3′ Splice Site Selection in the 844ins68 Polymorphism of the Cystathionine β-Synthase Gene,"844ins68 is a frequent polymorphism of the cystathionine β-synthase gene (CBS) that consists of a 68-bp insertion duplicating the 3′ splice site of intron 7 and the 5′-end of exon 8. The presence of two identical 3′ splice sites spaced by 68 bp should lead to either a selection of the proximal site or to at least two alternatively spliced CBS mRNA variants. Instead, an accurate selection of the distal 3′ splice site is observed in the 844ins68 carriers. The duplication has generated a gene re-arrangement at the 3′ splice site where two GGGG runs have been brought close to each other. Using a minigene system, we have investigated the effect this peculiar configuration might have on the selection of the 3′ splice site of intron 7 in the CBS gene. Minimal disruption of the G runs resulted in a dramatic shift toward the proximal 3′ splice site selection with inclusion of the 68-bp insertion and a consequent change of the reading frame. The insertional event created this peculiar configuration of two G repeats close to each other that subsequently acquired the ability to strongly bind heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H1, a specific trans-acting factor. The interaction of hnRNP H1 with G runs within the 844ins68 context might interfere with the recruitment of splicing factors to the proximal 3′ splice site thus favoring the selection of the distal 3′ splice site. Our results therefore suggest the possibility that the insertion was an evolutionary event that allowed the rescue of the wild-type sequence, so preserving protein function. 844ins68 is a frequent polymorphism of the cystathionine β-synthase gene (CBS) that consists of a 68-bp insertion duplicating the 3′ splice site of intron 7 and the 5′-end of exon 8.

The identification of the 844ins68 insertion of the cystathionine β-synthase gene was initially reported in a patient affected by homocystinuria (online Mendelian Inheritance in Man no. 236200) due to CBS 1The abbreviations used are: CBS, cystathionine β-synthase; nt, nucleotide(s); WT, wild-type; MS, mass spectrometry; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay deficiency (1Sebastio G. Sperandeo M.P. Panico M. de Franchis R. Kraus J.P. Andria G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 1324-1333PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies showed that the 844ins68 insertion is not a disease-causing mutation but is a common polymorphism in the general population, with a frequency of between 5 and 10% in Caucasians (2Sperandeo M.P. de Franchis R. Andria G. Sebastio G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 1391-1393PubMed Google Scholar,3Tsai M.Y. Bignell M. Schwichtenberg K. Hanson N.Q. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 1262-1267PubMed Google Scholar). It is absent among Asians and has a much higher prevalence among blacks (37.7% of heterozygotes and 4% of homozygotes) (4Franco R.F. Elion J. Lavinha J. Krishnamoorthy R. Tavella M.H. Zago M.A. Hum. Hered. 1998; 48: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The 844ins68 polymorphism consists of the insertion of 68 bp within exon 8 of the CBS gene and results in the presence of two 68-bp identical DNA repeats except in the presence of the CBS deficiency-causing mutation T833C in the first repeat (see Fig. 1). In fact, the 844ins68 polymorphism represents a duplication of the 3′ splice site at the CBS intron 7/exon 8 junction (53 and 15 nt upstream and downstream of the splice site, respectively), generating a proximal (3′p) and a distal (3′d) 3′ splice site in relation to the upstream IVS 7 5′ splice site (see Fig. 1 A). The 844ins68 allele generates, however, a normal transcript, and it has been shown that there is no increase of the odds ratios for any disease, at least when it is not associated with other risk factors (5Aras O.

Med. 1997; 62: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because the proximal and the distal 3′ splice sites of intron 7 are identical, either the selection of the proximal 3′ splice site or at least the coexistence of both the proximal and distal splice site selection in variable ratios are to be expected. On the contrary, it has been shown that the distal 3′ splice site is exclusively selected, such that the 68-bp insertion is skipped in the mature mRNA derived from the 844ins68 allele (2Sperandeo M.P. de Franchis R. Andria G. Sebastio G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 1391-1393PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, if the splicing pattern associated with the presence of the insertion is clear, the molecular mechanisms underlying the skipping of the 68-bp insertion are presently unknown. The included T833C mutation is also skipped, because of the absence of the 844ins68 insertion in the CBS mRNA. It is conceivable that the skipping of the insertion is likely to be driven by some sequences within the region of the insertion itself. In particular, we have noticed that the 844ins68 insertion creates a peculiar gene rearrangement at the 3′ splice site where two GGGG sequences, one at the beginning of exon 8 (6 nt downstream of the proximal 3′ splice site) and the other in the duplication (9 nt downstream of the insertion point), have been brought close to each other. Previous studies have shown that G runs are distributed throughout human introns (12Nussinov R. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1989; 6: 985-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and represent an enhancer-like element that seems to be important for the splicing of constitutive introns in chicken tropomyosin (13Sirand-Pugnet P. Durosay P. Brody E. Marie J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3501-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), human α-globin (14McCullough A.J. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4562-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and human growth hormone (15McCarthy E.M. Phillips 3rd., J.A. Hum Mol Genet. 1998; 7: 1491-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Moreover, G runs seem to be important for the regulation of splicing in virus (16Haut D.D. Pintel D.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1834-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Caputi M. Zahler A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We have, therefore, explored the possible effects of G runs on the regulation of the splicing of the CBS exon 8. The 3215-bp CBS genomic region of a subject heterozygous for the insertion 844ins68, spanning from exon 5 to exon 9, was amplified by PCR using primer 5′ CBS-Ex5/HindIII (5′-acgaagcttgtggacgtgctgcgggcactgg-3′) and 3′ CBS-Ex9/XhoI (5′-acgctcgagcgcacagcagcccctcttgcgcga-3′). The PCR product wasHindIII/XhoI cloned in pcDNA 3 expression vector (Invitrogen). Wild-type and 844ins68 clones were sequenced to confirm their identity and to exclude the presence of other mutations. The other mutant constructs were generated by PCR using WT and 844ins68 plasmids as templates. The DNA used for transfections was purified with JetStar columns (Genomed). Liposome-mediated transfections of 3 × 105 human hepatocarcinoma Hep3B cells were performed using DOTAP (Alexis). 5 μg of construct DNA was used for each transfection. After 12 h the medium was replaced with fresh medium, and 24 h later the cells were harvested. The RNA was extracted using RNAzolB solution (Biotex) and retrotranscribed with poly-dT primer. To amplify only the messenger derived from the transfections, PCR were carried out with CBS-Ex9/XhoI primer (annealing in the construct) and T7 primer (annealing in the vector). Each transfection experiment was repeated at least three times. 844ins68 and Gs-mutagenized 844ins68 CBS templates were synthesized by annealing the oligonucleotides CBS 844ins68 wt oligonucleotides S (5′-catcactggggtggatcatccaggtggggcttta-3′) and CBS 844ins68 wt oligonucleotide AS (5′-agcttaaagccccacctggatgatccaccccagtgatggtac-3′) as well as CBS 844 ΔG1-G2 oligonucleotide S (5′-catcactggtgtggatcatccaggtgcgtcttta-3′) and CBS 844 ΔG1-G2 oligonucleotide AS (5′-agcttaaagacgcacctggatgatccacaccagtgatggtac-3′), followed by direct cloning under the T7 promoter control into KpnI- andHindIII-digested pBluescript KS. G123 construct used for binding assays was generated by annealing the oligonucleotides 844ins68 G123 oligonucleotides Kpn/Hind S (5′-catcactggggtggatcatccaggtggggcttttgctggccttgagccctgaagccgcgccctctgcagatcattggggtggatcccga-3′) and 844ins68 G123 oligonucleotides Kpn/Hind AS (5′-agcttcgggatccaccccaatgatctgcagagggcgcggcttcagggctcaaggccagcaaaagccccacctggatgatccaccccagtgatggtac-3′). Mutant versions of the G123 construct (ΔG1G2, ΔG1, ΔG2, and ΔG3) were prepared by annealing oligonucleotides carrying mutagenized G1 (gggg → ggtg) and/or G2 (gggg → gcgt) and/or G3 (gggg → gcgt) runs. G1G2G3G4 and G3G4 constructs were generated by PCR using CBS 844ins68 and CBS 844 ΔG1-G2, respectively, as template with oligonucleotides CBS T7 ATC S (5′-tacgtaatacgactcactataggccgcgccctctgcagatcac-3′) and CBS G3G4 AS (5′-cgaggatggacccttcgggatccaccccaa-3′). A G1G2bis construct was also generated by PCR using CBS 844 ΔG1-G2 as template with CBS T7 ATC S and G1G2bis AS (5′-cagcaaaagccccacctggatgatccaccccaa-3′) oligonucleotides. Plasmids to be transcribed into RNA were first linearized byHindIII digestion. Preparative amounts of T7 polymerase transcripts were prepared from 25–50 μg of template in the presence of transcription buffer (350 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, and 40 mm dithiothreitol), 40 units of RNasin, 7 mmeach of the four NTPs, and 60 units of T7 polymerase (1.5 units/μg). Following incubation for 2 h at 40 °C, the RNA was purified using NICK Columns (Amersham Biosciences). In vitro T7-transcribed 32P-labeled RNA (4–6 fmol) was incubated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 10 μg/ml heparin, and 30 μg of nuclear extract in a final volume of 20 μl for 15 min on ice. Following the addition of 5 μl of 50% (v/v) glycerol (and tracking dye to only the free RNA samples), complexes were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel (ratio of 19:1 acrylamide:bis) in 75 mmm Tris-glycine buffer (75 mm Tris, 75 mm glycine) at 15–25 mA for 2–4 h at 4 °C. Gels were dried and exposures were made to X-Omat AR films for 1–6 h. For UV-cross-linking assays, all plasmids were linearized by digestion with an appropriate restriction enzyme. Transcription of cold and labeled RNA was carried out as described for band shift analysis.32P-Labeled RNA was incubated with 60 μg of HeLa nuclear extract as earlier described above for band shift assays. Following incubation, the samples were exposed to UV light (254 nm, 100 watts) at a distance of 5 cm for 10 min on ice. Then RNA was removed by digestion with 1 unit of RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min. The resulting32P-labeled proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE in the presence of molecular weight markers. The gel was dried and exposures were made to X-Omat AR film for 12–24 h. For the production of RNA template used for binding experiments, wild-type and G mutant 844ins68 CBS oligonucleotides were cloned in pBluescript KS KpnI/HindIII under the T7 promoter control. The CBS 844ins68 construct was obtained by cloning a double-strand oligonucleotide, which was generated by annealing 1 μg of CBS 844ins68 wt oligonucleotides S (5′-catcactggggtggatcatccaggtggggcttta-3′) and CBS 844ins68 wt oligonucleotide AS (5′-agcttaaagccccacctggatgatccaccccagtgatggtac-3′). The CBS 844 ΔG1-G2 construct was obtained by cloning a double-strand oligonucleotide, which was generated by annealing 1 μg of CBS 844ins68 ΔGs oligonucleotide S (5′-catcactggtgtggatcatccaggtgcgtcttta-3′) and CBS 844ins68 ΔGs oligonucleotide AS (5′-agcttaaagacgcacctggatgatccacaccagtgatggtac-3′). One nanomole (∼7.9 μg) of cold CBS 844ins68 and CBS 844 ΔG1-G2 RNAs was placed in a 400-μl reaction mixture containing fresh 0.1m NaOAc, pH 5.0, and 5 mm sodiumm-periodate (Sigma). Reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h in the dark at room temperature. The RNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 500 μl of 0.1 mNaOAc, pH 5.0. Then, 400 μl of adipic acid dehydrazide-agarose bead 50% slurry (Sigma) was washed four times in 10 ml of 0.1 mNaOAc, pH 5.0, and pelleted after each wash at 3000 rpm for 3 min in a Eppendorf minifuge. After the final wash, 300 μl of 0.1m NaOAc, pH 5.0, was added to the beads. The slurry was then divided into two aliquots that were mixed with each periodate-treated RNA sample and incubated for 12 h at 4 °C on a rotator. The beads with the bound RNA were then pelleted and washed three times in 2 ml of 2 m NaCl and three times in 3 ml of RNA wash buffer (52 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 8 mm Mg(acetate)2, 5.2 mm dithiothreitol, 38% v/v glycerol). They were incubated in 1× RNA binding buffer (i.e. RNA wash buffer added with 7.5 mm ATP, 10 mm GTP, and 5 mg/ml heparin) with 0.3 mg of HeLa cell nuclear extract for 20 min at 30 °C in a 500-μl final volume, pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 3 min, and washed five times with 5 ml of RNA wash buffer. After the final centrifugation 60 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer were added to the beads and heated for 5 min at 90 °C before loading onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Internal sequence analysis from the Coomassie Blue-stained bands excised from the SDS-PAGE gel was performed using an electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (LCQ DECA XP, ThermoFinnigam). The bands were digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were extracted with water and 60% acetonitrile/1% trifluoroacetic acid. The fragments were then analyzed by mass spectrometry, and the proteins were identified by analysis of the peptide MS/MS data with Turbo SEQUEST (ThermoFinnigam) and MASCOT (Matrix Science). The full coding sequence of hnRNP H1 was amplified by RT-PCR from HeLa total RNA using NdeI-S 5′-acgcatatgatgttgggcacggaaggt-3′ and BamHI-AS 5′-gatggatcctcaatgatggtgatgatggtggtggtgatgacctgcaatgtttgattgaaaatcact-3′, and then it was NdeI/BamHI-cloned in pET11a expression vector. Recombinant hnRNP H1 was expressed inEscherichia coli BL21DE3 strain and purified after migration in SDS-PAGE. The purified protein was used to produce polyclonal antiserum by immunizing a 3-month-old rabbit (New Zealand strain) according to standard protocols. Western blots were carried out according to standard protocol using 1/100 dilution of pre-immune or immune antiserum. To investigate the molecular basis of the CBS 844ins68 splicing, we set up a minigene system with generation of two basic constructs where the genomic regions spanning from CBS exons 5 to 9 with or without the 844ins68 insertion were cloned according to the original reading frame in the pcDNA3 eukaryotic expression vector. The analysis of the splicing pattern by RT-PCR of these constructs after transient transfections in the Hep3B cell line showed that both the wild-type and 844ins68 constructs reproduce the splicing pattern found in vivo, with activation of the distal 3′ splice site (Fig. 1 B). The 844ins68 of the CBS gene is particularly intriguing because it shows a natural duplication of the same 3′ splice site, similar to the non-natural models where two identical 5′ or 3′ splice sites were duplicated ad hoc. We considered the possibility that the skipping of the insertion might be driven by some sequences within the region of the insertion itself. In particular, we focused our attention on the two GGGG sequences, one at the beginning of exon 8 (6 nt downstream of the proximal 3′ splice site) and the other in the duplication (9 nt downstream of the insertion point), which have been brought close to each other by the insertional event. To study the possible effect of G runs on splicing in the CBS gene, we designed a series of mutants of the basic constructs where the first (ΔG1), the second (ΔG2), or both G (ΔG1-G2) runs were disrupted by point mutations (Fig. 2 A). These constructs were transiently transfected in the Hep3B cell line, and the splicing pattern was analyzed by RT-PCR using primers specific for the constructs. The identity of each PCR product in all transfection experiments was confirmed by sequencing. When the G1 and G2 runs were mutagenized in the 844ins68 construct, there was a shift in the selection of the 3′ splice site (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3–5). In fact, an activation of the proximal 3′ splice site was observed after mutation of both G1 and G2 strings or of the G1 string, leading to the retention of the 844ins68 insertion within the CBS mRNA (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4 and 5). The mutation of the G2 string alone also resulted in the activation of the proximal 3′ splice site, although a partial use of distal 3′ splice site was also observed (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). It is apparent that, in the 844ins68 context, both G1 and G2 runs are necessary for the activation of the distal 3′ splice site. The G1 and G2 runs are of course present in the wild-type allele, although they are in a different configuration (Fig.3 A). To determine whether they affect intron 7 splicing in the wild-type context, or if their effect on splicing is specifically due to the peculiar rearrangement created by the insertion, two other mutants were generated from the wild-type construct where each G1 and G2 run in its original position was mutagenized (Fig. 3 A, wild-type ΔG IVS7 and wild-type ΔG exon 8). A mutant of the 844ins68 was also designed in which the G run within exon 8 was mutagenized (Fig. 3 A, 844ins68 ΔG3). The transfections of all these mutants showed the full use of the IVS7 distal 3′ splice site, as observed using the wild-type construct (Fig.3 B, lanes 3–5). These results indicate that single G runs in their original location are not able to modulate IVS7 splicing. Furthermore, the T833C mutation alone was shown not to affect the wild-type splicing pattern (data not shown). To identify the trans-acting factors able to bind the G runs in the 844ins68 context, EMSA and UV-cross-linking assays were performed with in vitro transcribed RNAs containing either the core region of the CBS 844ins68 duplication (Fig.4 A, CBS 844ins68 construct) or the same sequence carrying point mutations within the G runs (Fig.4 A, CBS 844 ΔG1-G2 construct). Band shift experiments with the CBS 844ins68 construct in the presence of the nonspecific competitor heparin showed a broad band of shifted material (Fig. 4 B, lane 2), whereas no shift was observed with the CBS 844 ΔG1-G2 construct (Fig. 4 B,lane 1). Therefore, a specific complex is formed in presence of G strings in the CBS 844ins68 context. The nature of factors and/or protein(s) binding to G strings was investigated by a number of methods. Initially, because it was reported that U1snRNA binds to G triplets in the α-globin system (18McCullough A.J. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9225-9235Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), supershift analysis with anti-U1 antibody was carried out. Labeled CBS 844ins68 and CBS 844 ΔG1-G2 RNAs were incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts in the presence of an anti-U1A rabbit polyclonal antibody or a control rabbit polyclonal sera. Neither supershift nor complex disruption was observed in the CBS context (Fig. 4 A,lanes 3 and 4), whereas supershift was observed using a control template that included the consensus sequence for U1 (Fig. 4 C). Subsequently, the size and number of protein(s) binding were addressed by UV cross-linking of RNA-protein complexes. 32P-Labeled CBS 844ins68 or CBS 844 ΔG1-G2 RNA were cross-linked to protein by exposure to UV light, and the resulting 32P-labeled protein(s) were separated by SDS-PAGE. A prominent band of approximately 58-kDa molecular mass could only be observed with the CBS 844ins68 construct containing the G runs (Fig.5 A). The specificity of binding was further tested by performing competition assays. As expected, the bands were readily competed away from labeled CBS 844ins68 sequence by the addition of increasing amounts of cold CBS 844ins68 but not by the addition of increasing amounts of cold CBS 844 ΔG1-G2 (Fig. 5 B). The identity of proteins that bind specifically to the G runs in CBS 844ins68 RNA context was investigated through an affinity purification procedure that involves the cross-linking of transcribed CBS 844ins68 RNA to adipic acid dehydrazide-agarose beads. As a control, we used CBS 844ins68 ΔG1-G2-transcribed RNA cross-linked to agarose beads. Both beads preparations were separately incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts, and the proteins bound were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel and then analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining. Fig.6 A shows a clear difference between the binding patterns of the CBS 844ins68 and the CBS 844ins68 ΔG1-G2-derivatized beads. The CBS 844ins68 RNA specifically pulled down the 58-kDa protein, whose molecular mass was similar to that of the band observed in UV cross-linking assays. Moreover, a less abundant protein of apparent 53-kDa molecular mass was also pulled down. Internal sequencing by mass spectrometry of the main 58-kDa band resulted in seven peptides whose sequence correspond to residues 82–87, 89–114, 151–167, 180–185, 193–199, and 300–316 of hnRNP H1. The less abundant protein was also sequenced and was found to correspond to hnRNP F. Immunoblots with polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant hnRNP H1, then, confirmed the presence of this protein in the complex assembled onto CBS 844ins68 RNA and its absence from the CBS 844 ΔG1-G2 (Fig. 6 B). Binding specificity of hnRNP H1 has been described in different contexts (19Caputi M. Zahler A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43850-43859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To map the essential sequences required for interaction in the 844ins68 context, a series of mutants were prepared where the nucleotides proximal to both G runs were mutagenized, whereas the G runs were intact (CBS 844ins68B, Fig.7 A). The G1 run sequence (GGGGT) was mutated to (GGGGC), the G2 run sequence (TGGGG) was mutated to (AGGGG), and two single mutants and one double mutant were created. Binding to hnRNP H1 was observed with all mutants even if the intensity was slightly lower than that of the 844ins68 construct. These results suggest that the boundary nucleotides are not essential for binding but do contribute to increase the efficiency of such an interaction (Fig.7 B). A second set of UV cross-linking experiments was performed to test if the binding of hnRNP H1 to G runs was possible in the presence of a single Gs run or if tandem Gs repeats have to be present for optimal hnRNP H1 binding. Initially, a larger region of the 844ins68 duplication, including the G run within exon 8 (namely G3 run, Fig.8 A), was synthesized by oligonucleotide annealing and cloning in pBS KS under T7 promoter control (Fig. 8 A, G123). Three mutant versions of this construct were then generated in which either the G1 (ΔG1), the G2 (ΔG2), or the G3 (ΔG3) runs were mutagenized (Fig. 8 A). Fig. 8 B shows that the binding of hnRNP H1 to G runs can be observed only when G1-G2-G3 or at least G1-G2 runs were present. In fact, when G1 and/or G2 runs were mutagenized no significant binding was observed (Fig. 8 B, lane 2). Therefore, the presence of just one G run, and in particular G3, is not sufficient to promote hnRNPH1 binding in the CBS 844ins68 context. In addition, strong hnRNP H1 binding requires the presence of both G1 and G2 simultaneously, whereas the presence of two non-contiguous G runs (i.e. G1+G3 or G2+G3) is not sufficient for efficient hnRNP H1 binding (Fig. 8 B, lanes 2–4). Further indications of the importance of G1+G2 runs for protein interaction were obtained by comparison of the hnRNP H1 binding ability to a construct whose sequence includes the G4 run located 11 nt downstream of the G3 run (G3G4 construct, Fig.9 A) with that of a construct where the G1-G2 run context was reconstituted within exon 8 of the 844ins68 construct (G1G2bis construct, Fig. 9 A). The G3G4 construct is different from the G1G2bis construct for three insertions: two substitutions and an additional G. Fig. 9 B shows that G1G2bis but not G3G4 was capable of binding hnRNP H1, indicating that hnRNP H1 does not bind normally to the G3-G4 context within exon 8. The relative contributions of duplications to genetic pathology depend on factors such as the size of the duplicated region, the location of the duplication, incidence and severity of the effects of lesions, and selective factors (20Mazzarella R. Schlessinger D. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 1007-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this context, the identification of the 844ins68 insertion within the 3′ splice site of CBS IVS7 together with a second mutation (G913A) on the same allele in a patient affected by homocystinuria due to CBS deficiency represents an intriguing example of a duplication polymorphism associated with a variable disease susceptibility. The insertion 844ins68 is both structurally and functionally peculiar, because it consists of a duplication of the same 3′ splice site. In principle, the identity of two adjacent 3′ splice sites within the CBS intron 7 should at least determine the coexistence of two alternatively spliced CBS mRNA isoforms. Instead, the distal 3′ splice site is selected in 100% of transcripts determining the skipping of the 68-bp insertion in vivo. This observation prompted us to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. Our first approach was focused on the analysis of the 844ins68 sequence for possible cis-acting elements able of influencing 3′ splice site selection. In particular, we noticed two GGGG sequences, one at the beginning of exon 8 (6 nt downstream of the proximal 3′ splice site) and the other within the duplication (9 nt downstream of the insertion point), that have been brought close to each other by the insertional event. In comparison with other gene models where G runs are distributed throughout the entire intron or are located downstream the 5′ splice site (13Sirand-Pugnet P. Durosay P. Brody E. Marie J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3501-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 14McCullough A.J. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4562-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 15McCarthy E.M. Phillips 3rd., J.A. Hum Mol Genet. 1998; 7: 1491-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Carlo T. Sterner D.A. Berget S.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 342-353PubMed Google Scholar), the peculiarity of the Gs repeats in the 844ins68 context arises from the fact that they are located between two identical 3′ splice sites. Hence, the effects of G runs in the 844ins68 context might directly concern the 3′ splice site selection. Direct evidence of this fact is given by the observation that, in the 844ins68 context, the mutation of single G runs rescues the partial (ΔG2) or full (ΔG1) selection of the proximal 3′ splice site. On the other hand, the disruption of the single G runs in their original position and in particular, mutation of the G run within exon 8 in the wild-type context (wild-type ΔG exon 8 construct) did not alter the 3′ splice site selection and consequently had no effect on the wild-type splicing pattern (Fig. 3). Thus, our results show that G runs within the 844ins68 insertion are able to influence 3′ splice site selection in that context. These results are further supported by previous studies suggesting that the selection of splice sites can be affected by groups of G runs and not by single G runs (15McCarthy E.M. Phillips 3rd., J.A. Hum Mol Genet. 1998; 7: 1491-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, our data highlight the relevance of the insertional event for the creation of a splicing regulatory element. The investigation on the nature of the one or more factors that bind to G runs in the 844ins68 context revealed that an RNA probe spanning the 844ins68 duplication, including intact G runs formed a specific complex that can be visualized in an EMSA assay. A previous report has shown that G runs bind U1snRNA, in the α-globin model (18McCullough A.J. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9225-9235Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, using a different methodology that did not involve RNA-RNA cross-linking, we were unable to detect U1snRNA in the complex shifted upon binding to 844ins68 RNA context. Subsequent UV cross-linking experiments highlighted how G runs in the 844ins68 context form a 58-kDa complex. Two proteins able to interact with G runs were isolated through an RNA affinity purification method, and mass spectrometry microsequencing identified the main 58-kDa protein as hnRNP H1 and the minor 53-kDa protein as hnRNP F. The copurification by RNA affinity of hnRNP F together with hnRNP H1 is not surprising, because it is known that both hnRNP H and hnRNP F bind to poly(G) (22Matunis M.J. Xing J. Dreyfuss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1059-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and have been implicated in binding to an intronic splicing enhancer downstream of the 5′ splice site of c-src N1 exon (23Chou M.Y. Rooke N. Turck C.W. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 24Min H. Chan R.C. Black D.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2659-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In addition, hnRNP H1 might interact with hnRNP F as already shown in the c-src N1 model and could work as a heterodimer (23Chou M.Y. Rooke N. Turck C.W. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 24Min H. Chan R.C. Black D.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2659-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). On the other hand, hnRNP H has been reported to bind an exonic splicing silencer located within exon 7 of the rat β-tropomyosin gene (25Chen C.D. Kobayashi R. Helfman D.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and participates in the exclusion of this exon in non-muscle cells. Therefore, the presence of hnRNP H1 in the complex affinity-purified with 844ins68 RNA is consistent with the involvement of this protein in the definition of the duplicated region between the proximal and the distal 3′ splice site as an intron. Further definition of 844ins68 RNA binding specificity has shown that nucleotides immediately downstream of G1 (G4T → C) and upstream of G2 (A ← TG4) runs are not critical for protein binding and allow interactions with hnRNP H1 although possibly with lower affinity. Binding with other members of the hnRNP H family was not observed in the CBS 844ins68 context, in comparison with other models studied in a previous report (19Caputi M. Zahler A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43850-43859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the investigation of binding requirements has shown that hnRNP H1 mainly binds to the G1 and G2 runs only if they are present simultaneously. In fact, only constructs G123 and ΔG3 bind tightly hnRNP H1, whereas ΔG1G2, ΔG1, and ΔG2 constructs do not. This observation further supports the indication obtained from transfection experiments that the configuration of two G repeats brought close to each other by the gene rearrangement is responsible of the selection of the 3′ splice site of intron 7 in the 844ins68 context. An additional consideration regarding the binding requirements is that the distance between the adjacent G runs seems to be crucial. In fact, CBS ΔG3 construct binds hnRNP H1, whereas CBS ΔG2 does not. Considering that G1 and G2 are spaced by 14 nt, whereas G2 and G3 are separated by 46 nt, the gap between two contiguous G runs seems to be crucial for a stable interaction of hnRNP H1 with the target sequence. Further support to this hypothesis is provided by the rescue of hnRNP H1 binding obtained with construct G1G2bis where G1 and G2 runs were reconstituted within exon 8, at the 3′-end of construct ΔG1G2. Thus, different mechanisms can be proposed to account for the effects hnRNP H1 on the 3′ splice site selection in the 844ins68 context. It is possible that the interaction of hnRNP H1 with G1-G2 runs might hamper the access of constitutive splicing factors to the proximal 3′ splice site by sterical hindrance or by looping it out. Alternatively, hnRNP H1 may interact with other splicing factors so enhancing the selection of the distal 3′ splice site. In this way, the G elements brought close to each other might virtually extend the intronic region until the end of the duplication. In conclusion, our findings suggest the physiological relevance of insertional events to avoid a disease phenotype. In fact, it is apparent that the two G runs brought close to each other by the 844ins68 insertion work cooperatively in a CBS allele carrying the disease-causing mutation. This rearrangement, probably derived from an unequal crossing-over between the T833C and the wild-type alleles, may have been subjected to positive evolutionary selection, because it allowed the rescue of the wild-type sequence. Therefore, we propose that the duplication of the IVS7 3′ splice site DNA 68-bp segment carrying the T833C mutation generated an intron splicing regulatory element composed by the G1-G2 region that promotes the constitutive use of the distal 3′ splice site. This event allowed by-pass of the T833C substitution as well as of the whole 68-bp insertion and its associated premature stop codons, thus preserving the wild-type open reading frame and rescuing the protein function. To our knowledge, this is the best-characterized evolutionary event in which a small duplication results in a mutation correction through alteration of splicing regulation.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-022-05269-7,Social context mediates the expression of a personality trait in a gregarious lizard,"Abstract The social environment is a key factor that influences behavioural traits across a wide array of species. Yet, when investigating individual differences in behaviour, studies tend to measure animals in isolation from other conspecifics—even in social species. Surprisingly, whether behavioural traits measured in isolation are predictive of individual-level behaviour when in social groups is still poorly understood. Here, we repeatedly measured risk-taking behaviour (i.e. boldness; 741 total trials) in both the presence and absence of conspecifics in a social lizard, the delicate skink ( Lampropholis delicata ). Further, we manipulated food availability during group trials to test whether the effect of the social environment on risk-taking behaviour was mediated by competition over resources. Using 105 lizards collected from three independent populations, we found that individual risk-taking behaviour was repeatable when measured in either social isolation or within groups both with and without food resources available. However, lizards that were bolder during individual trials were not also bolder when in groups, regardless of resource availability. This was largely driven by individual differences in social behavioural plasticity, whereby individual skinks responded differently to the presence of conspecifics. Together, this resulted in a rank order change of individual behavioural types across the social conditions. Our results highlight the importance of the social environment in mediating animal personality traits across varying levels of resource availability. Further, these findings suggest that behavioural traits when measured in isolation, may not reflect individual variation in behaviour when measured in more ecologically realistic social groups.",W4297965468,False,0.7825595140457153

AN EXPERIMENTAL TEST IN NATURAL POPULATIONS OF STICKLEBACKS,"Theory suggests that frequency-dependent resource competition will disproportionately impact the most common phenotypes in a population. The resulting disruptive selection forms the driving force behind evolutionary models of niche diversification, character release, ecological sexual dimorphism, resource polymorphism, and sympatric speciation. However, there is little empirical support for the idea that intraspecific competition generates disruptive selection. This paper presents a test of this theory, using natural populations of the three-spine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus. Sticklebacks exhibit substantial individual specialization associated with phenotypic variation and so are likely to experience frequency-dependent competition and hence disruptive selection. Using body size and relative gonad mass as indirect measures of potential fecundity and hence fitness, I show that an important aspect of trophic morphology, gill raker length, is subject to disruptive selection in one of two natural lake populations. To test whether this apparent disruptive selection could have been caused by competition, I manipulated population densities in pairs of large enclosures in each of five lakes. In each lake I removed fish from one enclosure and added them to the other to create paired low- and high-population-density treatments with natural phenotype distributions. Again using indirect measures of fitness, disruptive selection was consistently stronger in high-density than low-density enclosures. These results support long-standing theoretical arguments that intraspecific competition drives disruptive selection and thus may be an important causal agent in the evolution of ecological variation.",W2159657431,False,0.675058901309967
https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.16266,Functional basis of primary succession: Traits of the pioneer microbes,"Primary succession describes the establishment of new ecosystems through the colonization of barren substrates (Odum, 1969). Bacteria are typically the first colonizers, which initiate key processes that enable ecosystem establishment and provide resources for fungi, plants, and animals to colonize later. The functional roles of these pioneer microbes are varied; for example, they can weather and detoxify environments to increase habitability, provide organic carbon and bioavailable nitrogen through carbon and nitrogen fixation, and form mutualistic relationships with plant species (Abdulla, 2009; Richardson & Simpson, 2011). As taxonomic and functional diversity increases over annual to decadal scales, communities in successional ecosystems transition from a collection of pioneer microbial species towards a robust and complex ecosystem (Álvarez-Molina et al., 2012; Brown & Jumpponen, 2015; Frouz et al., 2016). Much literature has explored plant community succession, resulting in a strong understanding of the nature, traits, and interactions of early and late colonizers and the development of strong ecological theory to explain these processes. However, understanding of pioneer microbial communities remains rudimentary, with most literature focusing on taxonomic composition rather than functional traits of colonizing bacteria. Numerous key questions remain, for example: How do the first microbes survive and grow in a barren and often hostile environment with minimal nutrients? How do microbes modify their environment for succeeding generations and species? How do these microbes interact with each other, plants, and animals as the new ecosystem develops? We propose here a series of study systems, methodological approaches, and ecological frameworks to address these questions. In turn, a better understanding of primary succession has broad implications for understanding ecological theory, biogeochemical processes, and responses to climate change. Moreover, by understanding how life colonizes barren and hostile locations, we can better predict how life evolved on Earth and might exist on other planets. Microbial primary succession occurs in a range of natural, host-associated, and engineered environments, which yield unique temporal and spatial contexts for the study of pioneer species (Fernández-Martínez et al., 2017). Glacier forelands, the area of newly exposed land from the leading edge of a retreating glacier, provide a temporal transect (a chronosequence) where the distance from the glacier edge can be used as a proxy for time. Sampling at the glacier edge can provide insight into microbial colonizers of newly exposed terrain, with the progressively older terrain once covered by the glacier harbouring more developed microbial communities and vegetation (Brown & Jumpponen, 2014; Fernández-Martínez et al., 2017; Strauss et al., 2012; Zumsteg et al., 2012). Volcanic lava flows provide opportunities to study microbial primary succession on truly sterile, naturally occurring substrates. Newly erupted lava crystallizes sterile basalt rock at temperatures of around 1150°C, with little or no organic matter, yet contains metals within minerals that may support initial ecosystem establishment, as well as spatial niches within the physical structure of the rock where endolithic communities may assemble. Human-engineered sterile environments, such acid mine drainage formed from newly extracted mining waste impose multiple physicochemical pressures that restrict first colonizers to polyextremophiles (Kupka et al., 2007; Liljeqvist et al., 2015; Wierzchos et al., 2018). Host-associated sterile environments can also provide novel and sometimes medically relevant insights into microbial community development; for example, primary bacterial colonization of the infant human gut results in an oxic environment rapidly becoming anoxic (Palmer et al., 2007), in a manner that varies with mode of delivery and the maternal microbiome (Dominguez-Bello et al., 2010). Microorganisms can even colonize extraterrestrial environments. Meteorites, which are also sterile upon entering the Earth's atmosphere, provide extraterrestrial input of minerals that are far from geochemical equilibrium with the geosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere (Tait et al., 2017). Some meteorites contain an enormous variety of organic molecules (including amino acids in some cases) that formed over 4.6 billion years ago and have never been exposed to terrestrial life (Schmitt-Kopplin et al., 2010). Fractures and porosity in the meteorites, and weathering of the external fusion crust over time, again provide ideal niches for microbial colonization and additionally make meteorites ideal microcosms for simulated studies of primary succession. Micrometeorites are far more abundant than meteorites, but geochemically equivalent, and preferentially accumulate in heavy mineral niches in wind-modified sediments (Tomkins et al., 2016, 2019). Tektites, which are terrestrial ejections of non-porous natural glass following a meteorite impact, provide a different sterile substrate in which biofilm may be the predominant colonization mechanism. Collectively, these environments provide unique opportunities to study first colonizers and their traits in a range of contexts, including comparisons of the various input sources of microbes and nutrients, and the unique physical and chemical characteristics that shape the developing community. Integrated methodological approaches are required to gain a mechanistic understanding of primary succession across these diverse ecosystems. Researchers have obtained some understanding of the identity of the first microbial colonizers, for example through marker gene-based surveys of bacterial, archaeal, and fungal community composition (Zumsteg et al., 2012). However, advances in genome-resolved metagenomics, multi-omics, and high-throughput cultivation mean it is now possible to develop a broader and deeper understanding of the nature, traits, or activities of microorganisms across successional gradients. In turn, these hypothesis-generating tools can be used to inform ecosystem-scale biogeochemical, imaging, and tracing experiments, as well as culture-based physiological and biochemical studies, that will provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of how microorganisms shape their environments and vice versa (Lewis et al., 2021). Landmark examples of integrated methodological approaches include King's studies in the 2000s on succession in volcanic deposits; he combined culture-dependent microbial genomics, culture-independent community and enzyme profiling, bulk geochemical analyses, and botanical surveys to demonstrate that trace gas oxidisers are the early colonizers in volcanic deposits and potentially promote plant development (Gomez-Alvarez et al., 2007; King, 2003; King et al., 2008; King & Weber, 2008). Through integration of cutting-edge culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches, there is now much potential to holistically understand the dynamics of succession and especially how functional traits impact successional trajectories. Each technique is limited in its own capacity, and synergising approaches across different scales facilitates more advanced and comprehensive discoveries (Greening et al., 2019). Mechanistic understanding of the ecological processes shaping microbial colonization in successional ecosystems is minimal. Four processes ultimately determine the composition and function of communities: dispersal, selection, drift, and diversification (Vellend, 2010). Previous work has suggested that the importance of these ecological drivers shifts during successional stages: dispersal dominates during initial stages and selection progressively increases thereafter (Dini-Andreote et al., 2015). Yet with respect to dispersal, the source of dispersing microorganisms remains undetermined. It is assumed that most microbes that colonize terrestrial substrates, for example volcanic lava flows, mine tailings, and glacier forelands, are dispersed from the atmosphere and sometimes via rainwater. However, this remains to be proven in part due to our limited knowledge of the microbial ecology of the atmosphere (Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2022). Likewise, although atmospheric dispersal is often thought to be a strictly neutral (stochastic) process, certain microorganisms are likely better adapted to be transported into and survive within the atmosphere (Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2018). Ultimately, side-by-side profiling of the nature, traits, and activities of microorganisms is required in successional ecosystems compared to the surrounding atmosphere and other potential sources (e.g., glacial ice and sub-glacial soils in glacier forelands). In addition, little is understood about functional traits that dictate whether microorganisms live or die during different successional stages. Strong environmental selection will control initial succession, though this selection can either weaken or strengthen over time depending on whether activities of pioneer microbes generate favourable conditions (e.g., through nitrogen fixation in glacier foreland soils [Strauss et al., 2012]) or unfavourable conditions (e.g., through acidification of mine tailings [Mielke et al., 2003]). Generally, it can be expected that resource competition and other antagonistic interactions will intensify during later successional stages as both microbial community diversity and environmental niche heterogeneity increase, which in turn increasingly favours habitat specialists over generalists. We predict that the first colonizers in terrestrial environments are self-sufficient habitat generalists. These microbes will have a range of adaptation strategies that allow them to colonize barren environments: metabolic strategies to acquire nutrients from atmospheric and mineral sources, dormant forms to withstand resource limitation, homeostatic mechanisms to survive physicochemical stresses, and potentially the capacity to mediate adhesion, weathering, and biofilm formation. Recent findings suggest that in oligotrophic ecosystems, trace gas oxidisers are the strongest candidates for the first colonizers (Mielke et al., 2003; Ortiz et al., 2021). As recently reviewed, these bacteria use trace (including sub-atmospheric) concentrations of hydrogen and carbon monoxide to conserve energy through aerobic respiration and, in some cases, generate biomass through chemosynthetic carbon dioxide fixation (Greening & Grinter, 2022). It is also proposed that metabolic water production by hydrogen oxidisers enhances water availability in desiccated environments (Ortiz et al., 2021). Many of these microbes are also predicted to use the energy derived from trace gas oxidation to acquire other nutrients, including bioavailable nitrogen through nitrogen fixation. Trace gas oxidisers span at least eight different bacterial phyla and are dominant in many extreme environments, including Antarctic desert soils, the aphotic ocean, and acidic mine drainage (Islam et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2017; Martínez-Pérez et al., 2022). Trace gas oxidisers are also reported to occur in successional volcanic soil ecosystems (Gomez-Alvarez et al., 2007; Hernández et al., 2020; King, 2003; King & Weber, 2008). Ultimately, by initially relying on energy sources from the ubiquitous atmosphere rather than less accessible minerals embedded in the colonized substrate, pioneer microbes can maintain viability and generate nutrients relatively independently of the physicochemical restraints of the environments they colonize. Nevertheless, the exact composition and traits of the first colonizers is likely to be modulated by the physical properties, chemical composition, and climatic conditions of the environments colonized. For example, meteorites vary greatly in physicochemical properties, with some being far more reduced than any surface environment on Earth and others being comparatively oxidized and rich in organic compounds. We predict that, whereas meteorites containing only inorganic material will be colonized primarily by gas-scavenging lithoautotrophs that gradually produce organic carbon, carbonaceous chondrites may also initially sustain lithoheterotrophs and organoheterotrophs that rely on extraterrestrial organic compounds (Abdulla, 2009; Tait et al., 2017). It can be expected that, over time, microbial communities will increase in biomass and diversity, and become more abundant, diverse, and specialized as other species are recruited. For example, the synthesis of organic carbon by lithoautotrophic trace gas oxidisers on meteorites may stimulate further microbial growth and biofilm formation. Organic carbon in the form of exudates and necromass are favourable carbon and energy sources for succeeding heterotrophic community members. In addition, biofilm-mediated changes in the surface chemistry or electrochemistry (bioweathering) accelerates the weathering of minerals (Abdulla, 2009; Angell, 1999; Palacios et al., 2019). Such changes may facilitate the succession of more specialist microbes that grow through iron- and sulfide-dependent chemolithoautotrophy. Some metabolically flexible microorganisms may even modulate their energetic strategies during different successional stages; for example, in acid mine drainage, pioneering microorganisms such as Acidithiobacillus may shift from an initial hydrogen-fuelled colonization and acid production towards more specialized iron- and sulfide-based metabolism (Islam et al., 2020; Mielke et al., 2003). In contrast, keystone microbial colonizers in alpine regions or glacier forelands create a more hospitable soil environment, achieved by physically altering the soil texture while chemically transforming major elements into more bioavailable forms (e.g., nitrogen fixation, carbon fixation or the solubilization and mineralization of the soil phosphorus pool) (Richardson & Simpson, 2011). This in turn, can make conditions favourable for the eventual colonization of plant populations, as well as their bacterial and fungal symbionts (Franzetti et al., 2020). A more comprehensive understanding of microbial primary succession has significant implications for our insights into and predictions of how ecosystems initially establish, develop, and are altered by climate change. One important implication for the near future is that rapidly expanding glacier forelands, brought about by widespread glacial retreat, create substantial deglaciated areas in which early ecosystems may carry out different biogeochemical functions than older, established soil ecosystems. In the future, this may impact biogeochemical cycling and global biodiversity on an increasingly broad scale (Stibal et al., 2020). Furthermore, climate and microclimate variation, in addition to topographic, fluvial, or aeolian disturbances, may alter the ability of first colonizer species to inhabit new foreland terrains and may drive a shift in the composition of the early ecosystems (Wojcik et al., 2021). Using knowledge of microbial primary succession, we may better predict patterns of new ecosystem establishment and how this might impact global processes. As primary succession requires microbes to establish a new community under 'bare minimum' conditions, their metabolic processes and survival strategies may give some insights into how life evolved on Earth (abiogenesis) and potentially other planets (exobiology). Indeed, the genesis of life on, or transport to, another planet represents primary succession in an extreme context (Michalski et al., 2018; Tomkins et al., 2020). Our understanding of this process on Earth is likely to inform our conceptualisation of the origin of life elsewhere. For example, it has been suggested that abiotic interactions between iron-containing minerals catalysed the synthesis of organic molecules on the early Earth (White et al., 2015). Furthermore, this research can yield valuable lessons for the biological protection of other planets. Microbial primary colonizers are likely to be highly resilient and adaptable, as they may need to survive atmospheric transport and must establish communities in environments with minimal nutrients: such organisms may be capable of colonizing terrains visited by spacecraft or rovers. For example, halophilic bacteria and archaea may be capable of surviving on Mars by coupling the oxidation of the high concentrations of atmospheric carbon monoxide with the reduction of terrestrial perchlorate (King, 2015). Sterilization procedures may even select for extremophiles that are well suited as primary colonizers (Ghosh et al., 2010). Even terraforming strategies, the practicality and ethics of which have been long debated (McKay et al., 1991), may therefore be informed and potentially mediated by the activities of microbial first colonizers. Much remains uncertain surrounding the functions, metabolic strategies, and impacts of microbial first colonizers in the process of primary succession. Rapid and continuing technological advances in culture-dependent and culture-independent methods provide opportunities to integrate techniques and make significant breakthroughs. This will allow scientists to address long-standing questions surrounding how these organisms survive, how their activities shape their environment to enable colonization by successive organisms, how this varies across different environments, and the original sources of these pioneers. Given most ecological theory of succession developed through studies of plant communities, rather than the earlier microbial pioneers with much broader niche range, there is much potential to test and refine theory. In turn, this may provide clues for how life evolved on Earth and can better inform the search for extraterrestrial life.

Three DNA polymorphisms previously identified as markers for handgrip strength are associated with strength in weightlifters and muscle fiber hypertrophy. J Strength Cond Res 33(10): 2602–2607, 2019—Muscle strength is a highly heritable trait. So far, 196 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with handgrip strength have been identified in 3 genome-wide association studies. The aim of our study was to validate the association of 35 SNPs with strength of elite Russian weightlifters and replicate the study in Polish weightlifters. Genotyping was performed using micro-array analysis or real-time polymerase chain reaction. We found that the rs12055409 G-allele near the MLN gene ( p = 0.004), the rs4626333 G-allele near the ZNF608 gene ( p = 0.0338), and the rs2273555 A-allele in the GBF1 gene ( p = 0.0099) were associated with greater competition results (total lifts in snatch and clean and jerk adjusted for sex and weight) in 53 elite Russian weightlifters. In the replication study of 76 sub-elite Polish weightlifters, rs4626333 GG homozygotes demonstrated greater competition results ( p = 0.0155) and relative muscle mass ( p = 0.046), adjusted for sex, weight, and age, compared with carriers of the A-allele. In the following studies, we tested the hypotheses that these SNPs would be associated with skeletal muscle hypertrophy and handgrip strength. We found that the number of strength-associated alleles was positively associated with fast-twitch muscle fiber cross-sectional area in the independent cohort of 20 male power athletes ( p = 0.021) and with handgrip strength in 87 physically active individuals ( p = 0.015). In conclusion, by replicating previous findings in 4 independent studies, we demonstrate that the rs12055409 G-, rs4626333 G-, and rs2273555 A-alleles are associated with higher levels of strength, muscle mass, and muscle fiber size.",W2964570991,False,0.009063654579222202
https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2016.5078,Tumor-promoting function of single nucleotide polymorphism rs1836724 (C3388T) alters multiple potential legitimate microRNA binding sites at the 3′-untranslated region of ErbB4 in breast cancer,"ErbB4 can act as either a tumor-suppressor gene or an oncogene in breast cancer. Multiple genetic factors including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affect gene expression patterns. Multiple 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) SNPs reside within the target binding site of microRNAs, which can strengthen or weaken binding to target genes. The present study aimed to predict potential 3'‑UTR variants of ErbB4 that alter the target binding site of microRNAs (miRNAs) and to clarify the association of the potential variant with the risk of developing breast cancer. In silico prediction was performed to identify potential functional SNPs within miRNA target binding sites in the 3'‑UTR of ErbB4. Thus, 146 patients and controls were genotyped using restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction. In addition to the Cochran-Armitage test for trend, allele and genotype frequency differences were determined to investigate the association between rs1836724 and the susceptibility to breast cancer. Bioinformatics analysis identified rs1836724 to be a polymorphism in the seed region of four miRNA binding sites (hsa-miR335-5p, hsa-miR-28-5p, has‑miR‑708‑5p and has‑miR‑665), which may participate in the development of breast cancer. Logistic regression data indicated that the T allele of the polymorphism [OR (95% CI)=1.72 (1.056‑2.808), P=0.029] is associated with the risk of breast cancer. Using bioinformatics tools, a correlation was indicated between the presence of the T allele and a reduction in ErbB4 RNA silencing based on miRNA interaction. Furthermore, case subgroup data analysis revealed an association between the C/T genotype and an ER positive phenotype [OR (95% CI)=6.00 (1.082‑33.274), P=0.028] compared with the T/T genotype. ErbB4 and estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) are regulated by identical miRNAs thus there may be a competition for binding sites. Due to this pattern, if the interaction between miRNAs with one gene is reduced, it may be consistent with the increase in interaction with another one. Therefore, more interaction with rs1836724 C variant within ErbB4 may be associated with higher expression of ESR1 (ER‑positive phenotype). miRNAs interact with ErbB4 mRNA more frequently when it carries C allele at the rs1836724 position compared with the T carriers. Therefore, the identical miRNA interacts with ESR1 less frequently when ErbB4 mRNA has a C allele. Therefore, ESR1 expression may be higher when ErbB4 mRNA has a C allele.",W2321879481,False,0.08624891191720963
