Part II: Trends,"The authors exploit the remarkable similarity between recent climate trends and the structure of the “annular modes” in the month-to-month variability (as described in a companion paper) to partition the trends into components linearly congruent with and linearly independent of the annular modes. The index of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) annular mode, referred to as the Arctic Oscillation (AO), has exhibited a trend toward the high index polarity over the past few decades. The largest and most significant trends are observed during the “active season” for stratospheric planetary wave–mean flow interaction, January–March (JFM), when fluctuations in the AO amplify with height into the lower stratosphere. For the periods of record considered, virtually all of the JFM geopotential height falls over the polar cap region and the strengthening of the subpolar westerlies from the surface to the lower stratosphere, ∼50% of the JFM warming over the Eurasian continent, ∼30% of the JFM warming over the NH as a whole, ∼40% of the JFM stratospheric cooling over the polar cap region, and ∼40% of the March total column ozone losses poleward of 40°N are linearly congruent with month-to-month variations in the AO index. Summertime sea level pressure falls over the Arctic basin are suggestive of a year-round drift toward the positive polarity of the AO, but the evidence is less conclusive. Owing to the photochemical memory inherent in the ozone distribution, roughly half the ozone depletion during the NH summer months is linearly dependent on AO-related ozone losses incurred during the previous active season. Lower-tropospheric geopotential height falls over the Antarctic polar cap region are indicative of a drift toward the high index polarity of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) annular mode with no apparent seasonality. In contrast, the trend toward a cooling and strengthening of the SH stratospheric polar vortex peaks sharply during the stratosphere’s relatively short active season centered in November. The most pronounced SH ozone losses have occurred in September–October, one or two months prior to this active season. In both hemispheres, positive feedbacks involving ozone destruction, cooling, and a weakening of the wave-driven meridional circulation may be contributing to a delayed breakdown of the polar vortex and enhanced ozone losses during spring.",W2052890963,False,0.004451335407793522

Therefore, it is very important to understand causes of these NAO variations and assess their predictability. It has been hypothesized, based on observations, that sea surface temperature (SST) and sea‐ice variations in the North Atlantic Ocean influence the NAO. We describe results of an ensemble of sixteen experiments with an atmospheric general circulation model in which we used observed SST and sea‐ice boundary conditions globally during 1949–1993. We show that multiyear NAO and associated climate variations can be simulated reasonably accurately if results from a large number of experiments are averaged. We also show that the ambiguous results of previous NAO modeling studies were strongly influenced by the ensemble size, which was much smaller than that in the present study. The implications of these results for understanding and predictability of the NAO are discussed.",W2136672073,False,0.00024351479078177363

Chthamalus is characteristically a southern species and Balanus balanoides a northern one, but the north and south ranges of the two species overlap in the British Isles and in France. The determining factor is presumably temperature. Chthamalus is an Atlantic species, and Balanus balanoides is more characteristically a North Sea species.

Both problems are potentially avoided by using abandoned agriculture lands for bioenergy agriculture. Here we show the global potential for bioenergy on abandoned agriculture lands to be less than 8% of current primary energy demand, based on historical land use data, satellite-derived land cover data, and global ecosystem modeling. The estimated global area of abandoned agriculture is 385−472 million hectares, or 66−110% of the areas reported in previous preliminary assessments. The area-weighted mean production of above-ground biomass is 4.3 tons ha−1 y−1, in contrast to estimates of up to 10 tons ha−1 y−1 in previous assessments. The energy content of potential biomass grown on 100% of abandoned agriculture lands is less than 10% of primary energy demand for most nations in North America, Europe, and Asia, but it represents many times the energy demand in some African nations where grasslands are relatively productive and current energy demand is low.",W1975625726,False,0.8929598927497864
https://doi.org/10.1080/17474230701622940,Mapping contemporary global cropland and grassland distributions on a 5 × 5 minute resolution,"This paper describes the development of agricultural land cover maps with 5 × 5 minute resolution based on satellite data and agricultural statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for the period 1990–2000. Consistency with the FAO data allows for reconstructing past changes and developing scenarios for future changes in land cover. Two base maps were used: (1) the International Geosphere–Biosphere Programme (IGBP) map based on DISCover data using the IGBP classification; (2) the Global Land Cover (GLC) map based on the Global Land Cover 2000 VEGA2000 data. The underlying DISCover data from the seasonal land cover regions were used to allocate the areas of cropland and grassland for the IGBP map. For the GLC map no such data were available, so a trial and error approach was used. While neither of the two base maps completely matched the FAO country data, combination of the IGBP and GLC maps resulted in a satisfactory match with FAO data for all countries. Apart from noise in the data, interpretation problems and uncertainties in the ancillary data used in interpretation, a major problem in allocating grasslands is the broad definition used by FAO, allowing for important differences between countries in the type of grassland included in the statistics. Comparison with Holdridge life zones showed that a large part (∼40%) of global grassland occurs in semi deserts, deserts and sub-polar tundra's, regions with unfavorable climates with low productivity and low carrying capacity. However, the distribution of grasslands over life zones varies widely in different parts of the world. Cropland occurs in more favorable climates.",W1520991730,False,0.6447542905807495

(ii) Empirical taxon‐specific approaches are based on previously documented invasions of particular taxa. (iii) Evaluations of the biological characters of non‐invasive taxa and successful invaders give rise either to general or to habitat‐specific screening procedures. (iv) Evaluation of environmental compatibility helps to predict whether a particular plant taxon can invade specific habitats. (v) Experimental approaches attempt to tease apart intrinsic and extrinsic factors underlying invasion success. An emerging theory of plant invasiveness based on biological characters has resulted in several rather robust predictions which are presented in this paper.",W1517697768,False,0.883030354976654

Collection of such residues must take into account concerns that residue removal could increase erosion, reduce crop productivity, and deplete soil carbon and nutrients. This article estimates where and how much corn stover can be collected sustainably in the USA using existing commercial equipment and estimates costs of that collection. Erosion constraints to collection were considered explicitly, and crop productivity and soil nutrient constraints were considered implicitly, by recognizing the value of residues for maintaining soil moisture and including the cost of fertilizer to replace nutrients removed. Possible soil carbon loss was not considered in the analysis. With an annual production of 196 million Mg of corn grain (∼9.2 billion bushels), the USA produces 196 million Mg of stover. Under current rotation and tillage practices, ∼30% of this stover could be collected for less than $33 Mg −1, taking into consideration erosion and soil moisture concerns and nutrient replacement costs. Wind erosion is a major constraint to stover collection. Analysis suggests three regions of the country (central Illinois, northern Iowa/southern Minnesota, and along the Platte River in Nebraska) produce sufficient stover to support large biorefineries with one million Mg per year feedstock demands and that if farmers converted to universal no‐till production of corn, then over 100 million Mg of stover could be collected annually without causing erosion to exceed the tolerable soil loss.",W1989647314,False,0.799317479133606
,Meeting US biofuel goals with less land: the potential of Miscanthus,"Biofuels from crops are emerging as a Jekyll & Hyde - promoted by some as a means to offset fossil fuel emissions, denigrated by others as lacking sustainability and taking land from food crops. It is frequently asserted that plants convert only 0.1% of solar energy into biomass, therefore requiring unacceptable amounts of land for production of fuel feedstocks. The C4 perennial grass Miscanthusgiganteus has proved a promising biomass crop in Europe, while switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) has been tested at several locations in N. America. Here, replicated side-by-side trials of these two crops were established for the first time along a latitudinal gradient in Illinois. Over 3 years of trials, Miscanthusgiganteus achieved average annual conversion efficiencies into harvestable biomass of 1.0% (30 t ha � 1 ) and a maximum of 2.0% (61 t ha � 1 ), with minimal agricultural inputs. The regionally adapted switchgrass variety Cave-in-Rock achieved somewhat lower yields, averaging 10 t ha � 1. Given that there has been little attempt to improve the agronomy and genetics of these grasses compared with the major grain crops, these efficiencies are the minimum of what may be achieved. At this 1.0% efficiency, 12 million hectares, or 9.3% of current US cropland, would be sufficient to provide 133 � 10 9 Lo f ethanol, enough to offset one-fifth of the current US gasoline use. In contrast, maize grain from the same area of land would only provide 49 � 10 9 L, while requiring much higher nitrogen and fossil energy inputs in its cultivation.",W3146968787,False,0.8709701299667358

These areas are often referred to as management zones Quick and automated procedures are desirable for creating management zones and for testing the question of the number of zones to create. A software program called Management Zone Analyst (MZA) was developed using a fuzzy c-means unsupervised clustering algorithm that assigns field information into like classes, or potential management zones. An advantage of MZA over many other software programs is that it provides concurrent output for a range of cluster numbers so that the user can evaluate how many management zones should be used. Management Zone Analyst was developed using Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 and operates on any computer with Microsoft Windows (95 or newer). Concepts and theory behind MZA are presented as are the sequential steps of the program. Management Zone Analyst calculates descriptive statistics, performs the unsupervised fuzzy classification procedure for a range of cluster numbers, and provides the user with two performance indices [fuzziness performance index (FPI) and normalized classification entropy (NCE)] to aid in deciding how many clusters are most appropriate for creating management zones. Example MZA output is provided for two Missouri claypan soil fields using soil electrical conductivity, slope, and elevation as clustering variables.

Permanent charge was taken as the summation of exchangeable metal cations, including Al displaced upon leaching with a neutral salt solution; pH dependent charge was regarded as the amount of exchange acidity (BaCl 2 ‐TEA) remaining after neutral salt leaching. Well‐developed upland soils had small permanent charges and large pH dependent charges. For soils of a given sequence, the permanent‐charge/pH‐dependent charge ratios (B 2 and above) were smallest for the red end member. Deeper horizons often had very large permanent charges, as did the B horizons of some Planosols. Latosolic soils had smaller permanent‐charge/pH‐dependent charge ratios than did Red‐Yellow Podzolics. Permanent‐charge components of CEC were countered exclusively by metal cations. In acid soils Al predominated, while Ca and Mg neutralized most of the permanent charge in soils with pH's above 6. There were negligible amounts of electrostatically‐bonded H in any soil. Generally exchangeable Al increased with depth. Yellow Podzolic and Planosolic soils in particular tended to have large amounts of exchangeable Al in lower horizons.

Root observation chambers have been used to examine the development of these mycelial networks and to assess their functional significance as pathways for the transfer of assimilate between individuals in a range of host‐fungus associations. Carbon transfer between plants of Pinus spp. is significantly increased by the presence of mycelial connections and preliminary evidence suggests that such transfer may be enhanced where concentration gradients are induced by shading. The significance of these experimental results is discussed in relation to nutrient cycling processes in natural ecosystems.,W1970566307,False,0.8639261722564697

More recently, Cormack (1964) gives a solution, including asymptotic variances, for a specific situation involving the marking and release of a non-random sample of fulmar petrels. His model is stochastic and will be referred to in? 4. Seber (1962, 1965) has also produced some interesting solutions, and these together with Darroch (1958, 1959) are most directly relevant to our present problem. Darroch (1958, 1959) shows that in a fully stochastic model with either immigration (often called dilution) or death (or emigration), the population parameters can be easily estimated by maximum likelihood. For the more general case when death and immigration are operating simultaneously he derives estimation equations by equating certain observations to their expectations, but does not give variances or covariances for the estimates. In a later paper, (Darroch, 1961), he considers estimation for a closed population consisting of different strata. Seber (1962) establishes a stochastic model for what he calls the multi-sample single recapture census in which an individual cannot be recaptured more than once. This situation arises, for example, when the recaptures are made in the course of hunting or fishing. He allows for both death and immigration in the population, provides explicit maximumlikelihood estimates of the parameters with variances, and suggests tests for certain of the assumptions. In a second paper, (Seber, 1965), he considers a multiple-recapture model differing only slightly from that of Darroch (1959), with both death and immigration. Again, he provides explicit maximum-likelihood estimates of the parameters with variances. A test is also given for equi-catchability in a closed population of individuals with different capture histories. The first purpose of the present paper is to derive a general probability distribution designed to fit the majority of capture-recapture problems involving a 'single' population. The word 'single' here denotes a population covering an area within whose boundaries the animals (or, in general, individuals or members) are free to move and to mix with others of their kind, but which is regarded as a single area in respect of which parameters are to be estimated. The type of situation which is thus excluded by this definition is one where the population is split into a number of defined areas, and separate population estimates are required for each area as well as for numbers of animals moving from one area to another. The single population, however, need not be homogeneous but may consist of different classes of animals behaving in different ways. The other assumptions underlying the model are stated with the notation in? 2, and the generalized probability distribution is derived in?3.",W1964104682,False,0.5734638571739197

,Informed consent to breech birth in New Zealand.,"The authors note significant room for improvement in facilitating informed consent in the management of breech presentation. New Zealand maternity care providers, including midwives, general practitioners and specialist obstetricians, have legal duties to provide full and unbiased information about risks and benefits of all relevant treatment options. In the case of breech presentation, such options include the interventions of external cephalic version or planned caesarean section, as well as the option to decline intervention and proceed with a planned vaginal breech birth. Information should be presented in a balanced and accessible way and not limited to the provider's personal preferences. Women have legal rights to make an informed choice, to give or refuse consent, to a second opinion and to co-operation among providers. The right of competent persons to refuse medical treatment, including the right to refuse caesarean section, is well established. Clinical policies therefore should include appropriate and non-coercive care for women who choose to birth their breech-presenting baby vaginally, compliance with such policies should be the norm, and consideration should be given to any institutional reforms or educational priorities needed to achieve this.",W1002743077,False,0.0017675933195278049
,New frontiers in the pharmacological prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis: the cytokines.,"Acute pancreatitis is a major complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), its incidence varying with the indications for the procedure (<5% for the management of common bile duct stones and up to 20% in the case of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction) and also with events occurring during the ERCP such as acinarization and pancreatic sphincterotomy. If the triggering event of premature intra-acinar activation of trypsinogen is unknown, the acinar cell injury leads to oxidative stress, nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B and subsequent transcription of chemo- and pro-inflammatory cytokines. These events are followed by chemoattraction and activation of monomacrophages, T lymphocytes and neutrophils which are responsible for acinar necrosis and amplification of the pro-inflammatory cascade. Finally, after amplification by Kupffer cells, systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ failure occur. All these events take place within a very short period of time, thus offering a very short therapeutic window during which it is theoretically possible to modulate the severity of human pancreatitis. Prophylactic immunomodulation of this pro-inflammatory cascade is attractive, using anti-inflammatory cytokines, specific inhibitors of pro-inflammatory cytokines or inhibitors of the nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor kappa B. Good results have been obtained in experimental models, reducing the acute pancreatitis severity and its systemic complications. The use of immunomodulators in the prevention of human post-ERCP pancreatitis is actually restricted to recombinant interleukin-10. Three of four randomized clinical trials, confirmed by a meta-analysis, have shown that prophylactic injection of recombinant interleukin-10 can significantly reduce the incidence of acute pancreatitis and may decrease the length of the hospital stay. The use of recombinant interleukin-10 in this indication has to be established in a multicenter prospective trial and we need to investigate the safety and efficacy of other immunomodulatory drugs and develop new specific targets.",W100632932,False,0.0006944541819393635
,Mechanisms involved in the onset of post-ERCP pancreatitis.,"In various prospective studies, the frequency of post-ERCP pancreatitis ranges from 1 to 14%. After exposure to trigger events, injury to the gland occurs extremely rapidly. In experimental models of acute pancreatitis, it has been suggested that digestive enzyme activation might occur within acinar cells and it has been shown that in the early stages of acute pancreatitis induced by secretagogues or by diet, there is a co-localization of digestive enzymes and lysosomal hydrolases within large cytoplasm vacuoles; this co-localization mechanism might result in activation of the digestive enzyme. In this article, we will review the trigger events which may determine the final effect of acute pancreatitis during ERCP and endoscopic sphincterotomy: mechanical, chemical, enzymatic and microbiological. Nonetheless, factors related to the patient and the physician will be considered. Finally, the hypothesis of activation of chemokines by endoscopic maneuvers as a cause of acute pancreatitis will be described.",W120854751,False,0.00036283722147345543
,Inhibition of TNF alpha improves survival in an experimental model of acute pancreatitis.,"The development of systemic complications in acute pancreatitis is largely responsible for the mortality associated with this disease. The systemic sequelae encountered in acute pancreatitis are similar to those occurring in patients with septic shock, a syndrome of multiple organ failure thought to be related to overproduction of inflammatory cytokines. As with sepsis, data is mounting that cytokines, particularly TNF alpha, may play a central role in acute pancreatitis and mediate the systemic sequelae of the disease. We have previously shown elevated levels of TNF alpha in the serum of animals with experimental acute pancreatitis. In this study, we use a bile-infusion model of pancreatitis in the rat to show amelioration of disease severity as well as a distinct survival advantage by TNF alpha blockade using anti-TNF alpha polyclonal antibody. These data provide strong evidence that TNF alpha is a major contributor to the morbidity and mortality from acute pancreatitis.",W128768472,False,0.000706021673977375
https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.151.3.1224,IL-10 inhibits macrophage costimulatory activity by selectively inhibiting the up-regulation of B7 expression.,"We have previously demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of IL-10 on ConA-induced T cell proliferation or IL-2 production by resting murine T cells were only observed when macrophages, but not when activated B cells, dendritic cells, or L cells, were used as accessory cells. To further elucidate the mechanism of action of IL-10 on the inhibition of macrophage costimulatory activity, we have used a system in which macrophages can develop into effective costimulator cells and the effect of IL-10 on this process can be studied in the absence of T cells. After fixation, resting macrophages have no costimulatory activity for soluble anti-CD3-induced T cell proliferation nor do they express the activation Ag B7/BB1. In contrast, macrophages activated by culture alone, or by culture with IFN gamma or LPS for 24 h, and then fixed, were effective accessory cells, expressed B7, and their costimulatory activity correlated with their level of cell surface B7 expression. Addition of IL-10 during the process of macrophage activation resulted in both a marked reduction in costimulatory activity and in B7 expression. IL-4 and transforming growth factor-beta that suppress many macrophage functions did not inhibit the induction of B7 expression. The inhibitory effect of IL-10 on the up-regulation of B7 was selective because the up-regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and MHC class II Ag was not affected. Direct evidence that the lack of B7 is the relevant limiting defect for IL-10-treated macrophage accessory cell function was obtained from studies in which the costimulatory capacity of IL-10-treated macrophages could be completely restored by the addition of B7 transfected, but not nontransfected, L cells to the assays.",W1517658874,False,0.0050941999070346355

Objective To investigate the recurrence risk of breech presentation at term, and to assess the risk factors that contribute to its recurrence. Design Cohort study. Setting New South Wales, Australia. Population Women with their first two ( n = 113 854) and first three ( n = 21 690) consecutive singleton term pregnancies, in the period 1994–2002. Methods Descriptive statistics including rates, relative risks and adjusted relative risks, as determined from logistic regression and Poisson analyses. Main outcome measures Rates and risks of occurrence and recurrence of breech presentation at birth in each pregnancy, and maternal and infant risk factors associated with breech recurrence. Results First‐time breech presentation at term occurred in 4.2% of first pregnancy deliveries, 2.2% of second pregnancies and 1.9% of third pregnancies. The rate of breech recurrence in a second consecutive pregnancy was 9.9%, and in a third consecutive pregnancy (after two prior breech deliveries) was 27.5%. The relative risk of breech recurrence in a second pregnancy was 3.2 (95% CI 2.8–3.6), and in a third consecutive breech pregnancy was 13.9 (95% CI 8.8–22.1). First pregnancy factors associated with recurrence included placenta praevia [adjusted relative risk (aRR) 2.2; 95% CI 1.3–3.7], maternal diabetes (aRR 1.4; 95% CI 1.0–2.1) and a maternal age of ≥35 years (aRR 1.2; 95% CI 0.9–1.6). Second pregnancy factors included birth defects (aRR 2.5; 95% CI 1.4–4.2), placenta praevia (aRR 2.5; 95% CI 1.5–4.1) and a female infant (aRR 1.2; 95% CI 1.0–1.5).

https://doi.org/10.3133/pp1677,"Computation and analysis of the instantaneous-discharge record for the Colorado River at Lees Ferry, Arizona — May 8, 1921, through September 30, 2000","A gaging station has been operated by the U.S. Geological Survey at Lees Ferry, Arizona, since May 8, 1921. In March 1963, Glen Canyon Dam was closed 15.5 miles upstream, cutting off the upstream sediment supply and regulating the discharge of the Colorado River at Lees Ferry for the first time in history. To evaluate the pre-dam variability in the hydrology of the Colorado River, and to determine the effect of the operation of Glen Canyon Dam on the downstream hydrology of the river, a continuous record of the instantaneous discharge of the river at Lees Ferry was constructed and analyzed for the entire period of record between May 8, 1921, and September 30, 2000. This effort involved retrieval from the Federal Records Centers and then synthesis of all the raw historical data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey at Lees Ferry. As part of this process, the peak discharges of the two largest historical floods at Lees Ferry, the 1884 and 1921 floods, were reanalyzed and recomputed. This reanalysis indicates that the peak discharge of the 1884 flood was 210,000±30,000 cubic feet per second (ft3/s), and the peak discharge of the 1921 flood was 170,000±20,000 ft3/s. These values are indistinguishable from the peak discharges of these floods originally estimated or published by the U.S. Geological Survey, but are substantially less than the currently accepted peak discharges of these floods. The entire continuous record of instantaneous discharge of the Colorado River at Lees Ferry can now be requested from the U.S. Geological Survey Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center, Flagstaff, Arizona, and is also available electronically at This record is perhaps the longest (almost 80 years) high-resolution (mostly 15- to 30-minute precision) times series of river discharge available. Analyses of these data, therefore, provide an unparalleled characterization of both the natural variability in the discharge of a river and the effects of dam operations on a river.Following the construction and quality-control checks of the continuous record of instantaneous discharge, analyses of flow duration, sub-daily flow variability, and flood frequency were conducted on the pre- and post-dam parts of the record. These analyses indicate that although the discharge of the Colorado River varied substantially prior to the closure of Glen Canyon Dam in 1963, operation of the dam has caused changes in discharge that are more extreme than the pre-dam natural variability. Operation of the dam has eliminated flood flows and base flows, and thereby has effectively ""flattened"" the annual hydrograph. Prior to closure of the dam, the discharge of the Colorado River at Lees Ferry was lower than 7,980 ft3/s half of the time. Discharges lower than about 9,000 ft3/s were important for the seasonal accumulation and storage of sand in the pre-dam river downstream from Lees Ferry. The current operating plan for Glen Canyon Dam no longer allows sustained discharges lower than 8,000 ft3/s to be released. Thus, closure of the dam has not only cut off the upstream supply of sediment, but operation of the dam has also largely eliminated discharges during which sand could be demonstrated to accumulate in the river. In addition to radically changing the hydrology of the river, operation of the dam for hydroelectric-power generation has introduced large daily fluctuations in discharge. During the pre-dam era, the median daily range in discharge was only 542 ft3/s, although daily ranges in discharge exceeding 20,000 ft3/s were observed during the summer thunderstorm season. Relative to the pre-dam period of record, dam operations have increased the daily range in discharge during all but 0.1 percent of all days. The post-dam median daily range in discharge, 8,580 ft3/s, exceeds the pre-dam median discharge of 7,980 ft3/s. Operation of the dam has also radically changed the frequency of floods on the Colorado River at Lees Ferry. The frequency of floods with peak discharges larger than about 29,000 ft3/s has greatly decreased, while the frequency of smaller floods, with peak discharges between 18,500 and 29,000 ft3/s, has increased substantially. Operation of the dam has greatly extended the duration of smaller floods; for example, each of the four longest periods of sustained flows in excess of 18,500 ft3/s occurred after closure of the dam.",W1559275546,False,0.6685197949409485

Small-scale vegetable growers may be able to include lettuce in their production through selection of bolt tolerant and nonbitter varieties. The objectives of this research were to evaluate earliness, bitterness, vitamin E, ascorbic acid, folate, β-carotene, and lutein content in 17 lettuce varieties. Significant difference were found among varieties for days to harvest (DTH) (47 DTH for `Epic' to 37 DTH for `Big Curly'). Observed DTH in this study was consistently 7 to 10 days less than commercial descriptions of the lettuce varieties, due to the use of transplants. Only `Slobolt' and `Greengo' bolted before reaching marketable size. Panelists found that the bitterness was acceptable for most varieties, but not for `Nancy,' `Big Curly,' and `Slobolt'. Significant differences among varieties were also found in vitamin E, ascorbic acid, folate, β-carotene, and lutein. `Redprize' and `Nevada' were the best varieties overall, while `Salinas 88 Supreme,' `Epic,' `Legacy,' `Big Curly,' `Slobolt,' and `Greengo' were unacceptable.",W1906648122,False,0.3050614297389984

Even within a species, accessions from different environments can exhibit markedly different flowering behavior. In Arabidopsis, some accessions are rapid-cycling summer annuals, whereas others accessions are late flowering and vernalization responsive and thus behave as winter annuals. Two genes, FLOWERING LOCUS C ( FLC ) and FRIGIDA ( FRI ), interact synergistically to confer the winter-annual habit. Previous work has shown that many summer-annual accessions contain null mutations in the FRI gene; thus it appears that these summer-annual accessions have arisen from winter-annual ancestors by losing FRI function. In this work we demonstrate that naturally occurring allelic variation in FLC has provided another route to the evolution of summer-annual flowering behavior in Arabidopsis. We have identified two summer-annual accessions, Da (1)-12 and Shakhdara, that contain functional alleles of FRI, but are early flowering because of weak alleles of FLC. We have also determined that the weak allele of FLC found in Landsberg erecta is naturally occurring. Unlike accessions that have arisen because of loss-of-function mutations in FRI, the FLC alleles from Da (1)-12, Shakhdara, and Landsberg erecta are not nulls; however, they exhibit lower steady-state mRNA levels than strong alleles of FLC. Sequence analysis indicates that these weak alleles of FLC have arisen independently at least twice during the course of evolution.",W1979936449,False,0.1296280473470688

An alternative is multiple harvest of the shrub, cut at ground level, at an optimal interval as long as an economic yield is obtainable. for this, guayule cultivars with nearly 100% survival after each harvest are required. The objectives of this study were to compare guayule cultivars and selections in the filed for their regrowth ability after harvest, and to determine the relative contributions of under‐ and aboveground parts to the overall rubber yield of the plant. In a completely randomized design with three replications, 84‐week‐old dormant, 96‐week‐old actively growing, and 132‐week‐old dormant plants of 11 cultivars and selections were cut at ground level in February and May 1985, and February 1986. Harvest date was found to be a critical factor: an average of 49% of the plants harvested in February regrew, while only 1.4% of those harvested in May regrew. Marked differences between lines were observed in the February harvests. Approximately 97% of selection C2501 plants produced vigorous regrowth, but only 5.5% of C2551 plants regrew. Regrowth of the other entries lay within these extremes. Five of the entries were compared for the contributions of the under‐ and aboveground parts to the overall yield.

Indices quantifying the functional aspect of biodiversity are essential in understanding relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and environmental constraints. Many indices of functional diversity have been published but we lack consensus about what indices quantify, how redundant they are and which ones are recommended. 2. This study aims to build a typology of functional diversity indices from artificial data sets encompassing various community structures (different assembly rules, various species richness levels) and to identify a set of independent indices able to discriminate community assembly rules. 3. Our results confirm that indices can be divided into three main categories, each of these corresponding to one aspect of functional diversity: functional richness, functional evenness and functional divergence. Most published indices are highly correlated and quantify functional richness while quadratic entropy ( Q ) represents a mix between functional richness and functional divergence. Conversely, two indices (FEve and FDiv respectively quantifying functional evenness and functional divergence) are rather independent to all the others. The power analysis revealed that some indices efficiently detect assembly rules while others performed poorly. 4. To accurately assess functional diversity and establish its relationships with ecosystem functioning and environmental constraints, we recommend investigating each functional component separately with the appropriate index. Guidelines are provided to help choosing appropriate indices given the issue being investigated. 5. This study demonstrates that functional diversity indices have the potential to reveal the processes that structure biological communities. Combined with complementary methods (phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity), the multifaceted framework of functional diversity will help improve our understanding of how biodiversity interacts with ecosystem processes and environmental constraints.",W1603378435,False,0.7781984806060791

Combining near‐isogenic line mapping with genome expression profiling offers a unique opportunity for exploring the functional relationship between genotype and phenotype and for generating candidate genes for future study. We used a whole‐genome microarray produced with ink‐jet technology to measure the relative expression level of over 21 500 genes from an Arabidopsis thaliana near‐isogenic line (NIL) and its recurrent parent. The NIL material contained two introgressions (bottom of chromosome II and top of chromosome III) of the Cvi‐1 ecotype in a L er ‐2 ecotype genome background. Each introgression ‘captures’ a Cvi allele of a physiological quantitative trait loci (QTL) that our previous studies have shown increases transpiration and reduces water‐use efficiency at the whole‐plant level. We used a mixed model anova framework for assessing sources of expression variability and for evaluating statistical significance in our array experiment. We discovered 25 differentially expressed genes in the introgression at a false‐discovery rate (FDR) cut‐off of 0.20 and identified new candidate genes for both QTL regions. Several differentially expressed genes were confirmed with QRT–PCR (quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction) assays. In contrast, we found no statistically significant differentially expressed genes outside of the QTL introgressions after controlling for multiple tests. We discuss these results in the context of candidate genes, cloning QTL, and phenotypic evolution.",W1568119754,False,0.07916682213544846

These lines were assessed for fitness in common garden reciprocal transplant experiments in two contrasting field sites in each of two years, as well as a novel, benign greenhouse environment. An AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) linkage map of 129 markers spanned 644 cM in 19 linkage groups, which is smaller, with more linkage groups, than expected. Therefore parts of the A. barbata genome remain unmapped, possibly because they lack variation between the ecotypes. Nevertheless, we identified QTL (quantitative trait loci) under selection in both native environments and in the greenhouse. Across years at the same site, the same loci remain under selection, for the same alleles. Across sites, an overlapping set of loci are under selection with either (i) the same alleles favoured at both sites or (ii) loci under selection at one site and neutral at the other. QTL under selection in the greenhouse were generally unlinked to those under selection in the field because selection acted on a different trait. We found little evidence that selection favours alternate alleles in alternate environments, which would be necessary if genotype by environment interaction were to maintain genetic variation in A. barbata. Additive effect QTL were best able to explain the genetic variation among recombinant inbred lines for the greenhouse environment where heritability was highest, and past selection had not eliminated variation.",W1854341434,False,0.8566539883613586

The molarity of aqueous ethanol droplets that were absorbed by the soil in 10 s, the time of water droplet entry and the infiltration rate of water from a small ring infiltrometer were compared with the soil-water contact angle and with each other. Relationships between the tests were fitted by linear, quadratic and cubic regressions and were highly significant (100r2 = 70-92). The relationships were used to provide ratings of repellence normally found in the field. Factors which affect the measurement of repellence in the field were examined. Abrasion of sand particles during light sieving had only small effects on repellence, but more vigorous abrasion through rotational movement of the sand reduced repellence markedly. Repellence decreased with increasing temperature. Simple corrections for temperature were calculated and presented in figures as isorating charts. The moisture content of the soil had large and variable effects on the repellence tests. At moisture contents between oven and air dry (pF 5.6) there was little effect on the ethanol droplet or infiltration rate tests. Measurements by the ethanol droplet test were not reliable at moisture contents greater than air dry. At soil water contents between air dry and wilting point (pF 4.2), the infiltration rate of water was either unchanged or decreased in different soils. It then increased rapidly and reached a constant value near field capacity (pF 2.5). The infiltration rate also decreased when the time of moistening of the soil before the tests were made was extended from 20 to 168 h. It is recommended that repellence tests be made on oven- or air-dry soils. The aqueous ethanol and water droplet, and infiltration rate of water tests are all suitable for rapid assessment of repellence in the field.",W1964141349,False,0.25385797023773193

Very little is known about subsurface flow in sandy deserts with less than 100 mm of rainfall per year. The present study deals with the water regime in a system of longitudinal dunes in the Negev desert. Sixteen boreholes were dug, down to a depth of 6 m, across a sandy ridge and the adjacent corridor. Soil moisture and water movement were monitored with a neutron probe during two consecutive years. The first year had been relatively wet and in the following year the rainfall was slightly lower than the long-term average. The data obtained show that in an average year water percolation is limited to 60 cm with no lateral water movement. Deeper percolation, in the range 180–400 cm, occurs in response to rainy spells with about 100 mm of cumulative rain within two months. The process involves subsurface lateral flow and water movement by the piston effect. The lateral flow, on the flanks of the dune, is explained by differences in hydraulic conductivities within the sloping layers. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",W2044527828,False,0.4940723180770874
https://doi.org/10.3133/ofr85198,"Geohydrology of the unsaturated zone at the burial site for low-level radioactive waste near Beatty, Nye County, Nevada","Low-level radioactive solid waste has been buried in trenches at a site near Beatty, Nevada, since 1962. In 1976, as part of a national program, the U.S. Geological Survey began a study of the geohydrology of the waste burial site to provide a basis for estimating the potential for radionuclide migration in the unsaturated zone beneath the waste burial trenches. Data collected include meteorological information for calibration of a long-term water budget analysis, soil moisture profiles, soil water potentials, and hydraulic properties of representative unsaturated sediment samples to a depth of about 10 m. The waste burial facility is in the northern Amargosa Desert about 170 km northwest of Las Vegas, NV. The region is arid; mean annual precipitation at Lathrop Wells, 30 km south of the site, is only 7.4 cm. The mean daily maximum temperature at Lathrop Wells in July, the hottest month, is 37 C. The site is underlain by poorly stratified deposits of gravelly or silty sand and sandy gravel, and thick beds of clayey sediments. The total thickness of valley fill deposits beneath the site is about 175 m; the unsaturated zone is about 85 m thick. Volumetric soil moisture to depths of 4 m ranges from 4% to 10%, but commonly is in the range from 6% to 8%. Soil water potential, measured to depths of 3 to 10 m, ranged from -10 to -70 bars. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity computed from laboratory analyses of representative samples ranges from 10 to the -13th power to 10 to the -4th power cm/day. Evaporation studies over a 2-yr period were used to calibrate a numerical procedure for analyzing long-term precipitation data and estimating annual water budgets during the 15-yr period 1962-76. This analysis (1) demonstrated that a potential exists for deep percolation (> 2 m), despite high annual evaporation demands, and (2) provided predictions of the time of yr and the antecedent conditions which enhance the probability of deep percolation. Soil moisture profiles obtained monthly over an 18-mo period demonstrate that deep percolation does occur. Soil moisture conditions antecedent to an observed deep-percolation event, and the time of yr when the percolation occurred, support the interpretations based on long-term meteorological records.

All datasets show that intensity is at a maximum in the winter hemisphere and at a minimum in the summer hemisphere. Maximum and minimum values of meridional extent are reached in the respective autumn and spring hemispheres. While considering the horizontal momentum balance, where a weakening of the Hadley cell (HC) is expected in association with a widening, it is shown here that there is no direct relationship between intensity and extent on a monthly time scale. All reanalyses show an expansion in both hemispheres, most pronounced and statistically significant during summer and autumn at an average rate of expansion of 0.55° decade−1 in each hemisphere. In contrast, intensity trends are inconsistent among the datasets, although there is a tendency toward intensification, particularly in winter and spring. Correlations between the HC and tropical and extratropical large-scale modes of variability suggest interactions where the extent of the HC is influenced by El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the annular modes. The cells tend to shrink (expand) during the warm (cold) phase of ENSO and during the low (high) phase of the annular modes.

An intercomparison of eight reanalyses is presented to better elucidate the mean state variability and trends concerning HC intensity and width. Significant variability between reanalyses was found in the mean HC intensity with less variability in HC width. Certain reanalyses (e.g., ERA40 and the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis) tend to produce stronger meridional overturning, while others (National Centers for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research and Modern-Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications) are constantly weaker. The NOAA–Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences Twentieth Century Reanalysis best matched the ensemble averages with the exception of a poleward shift in the subtropical terminus. Ensemble trends regarding HC intensity and width are broadly consistent with previous work, indicating a 0.40 (0.07) × 1010 kg s−1 decade−1 intensification in the northern (southern) cell and a 1.1° decade−1 widening in the past 30 years, although some uncertainty remains regarding the intensity of the southern cell. Longer-term ensemble trends (i.e., 1958–2008) containing fewer ensemble members suggest a weaker northern cell intensification but stronger southern cell intensification and a more modest widening of the HC (i.e., 0.53° decade−1) compared to the last 30 years.

https://doi.org/10.1029/2007jd009278,"Uncertainties in the climate mean state of global observations, reanalyses, and the GFDL climate model","Climate research relies on realistic atmospheric data over long periods of time. Global reanalyses or observations are commonly used for this type of work. However, the many problems associated with both the reanalyses and observations cast doubts on the reliability of such data for climate applications, and users often need to know how large the errors and uncertainties associated with the different data sets are. This paper is a systematic assessment of the errors and uncertainties contained in the time mean (1979–1999) of many different climate quantities taken from a variety of global data sets, including four popular reanalyses, the output of the climate model developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), and a wide range of observations. We find that the ability of reanalyses to reproduce the observed climate mean state varies widely, with radiative quantities exhibiting the largest discrepancies. The different reanalysis products share many common errors, but overall the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts 40‐year reanalysis (ERA‐40) matches best the observations. Interestingly, the climate model reproduces the observed climate mean state of certain quantities more faithfully than the reanalyses. This indicates that modern models have reached a high level of realism in their mean state and that care must be taken when reanalyses are used to validate models. A particular concern of this paper is the time mean uncertainty associated with specific observation‐based atmospheric quantities. Observational uncertainties are estimated from the difference amongst alternative data sets for the same quantity. We show that for most quantities the observational uncertainty is smaller than the error of the reanalyses or the model. However, there are some notable exceptions. In particular, for the surface fluxes of heat, momentum, and radiation the observational uncertainties can be as large as the errors seen in the reanalyses or the model. The investigation of uncertainties in upper atmospheric quantities is restricted to reanalysis and model data, since no appropriate observations are available. In this case, the reanalyses uncertainties are generally smaller than the model errors, except for quantities which describe the meridional component of the atmospheric circulation.",W1537407544,False,0.009199211373925209

https://doi.org/10.1029/134gm05,Atmospheric processes governing the Northern Hemisphere annular mode/North Atlantic Oscillation,"The North Atlantic Oscillation, referred to herein as the Northern Hemisphere annular mode (NAM), owes its existence entirely to atmospheric processes. In this chapter, we review the structure of the NAM in the atmospheric general circulation, discuss opposing perspectives regarding its physical identity, examine tropospheric processes thought to give-rise to NAM-like variability, and review the role of the stratosphere in driving variability in the NAM. the NAM is characterized by a deep, nearly barotropic structure, with zonal wind perturbations of opposing sign along ˜55° and ˜35° latitude. It has a pronounced zonally symmetric component, but exhibits largest variance in the North Atlantic sector. During the Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter, the NAM is strongly coupled to the circulation of the NH stratosphere. the NAM also affects tropical regions, where it perturbs the temperature and wind fields of both the tropical troposphere and stratosphere. the structure of the NAM is remarkably similar to the structure of the leading mode of variability in the Southern Hemisphere circulation. the processes that give rise to annular variability are discussed. In the troposphere, the NAM fluctuates on timescales of ˜10 days and is associated with anomalous fluxes of zonal momentum of baroclinic waves across ˜45°N. It is argued that the tropospheric component of the NAM exhibits largest variance in the Atlantic sector where the relatively weak thermally driven subtropical flow and the relatively warm lower boundary conditions at subpolar latitudes permit marked meridional excursions by baroclinic waves. In the stratosphere, fluctuations in the NAM evolve on timescales of several weeks. Evidence is presented that long-lived anomalies in the stratospheric NAM frequently precede similarly persistent anomalies in the tropospheric NAM. It is argued that variability in the lower stratospheric polar vortex yields a useful level of predictive skill for NH wintertime weather on both intraseasonal and seasonal timescales. the possible dynamics of these linkages are outlined. the recasting of the North Atlantic Oscillation as an expression of an annular mode has generated a debate over the physical identity of the mode in question. This debate attests to the absence of a unique theory for the existence of annular modes in the first place.

Most of the seeds stored alternately at 18 and 40 °C after-ripened in 3 years. At temperatures below 18 °C after-ripening was not complete after 5 years.Dormant seeds became more dormant when exposed to germinative conditions and subsequent drying. Induction of dormancy by this means (aerobic conditions) can prolong the life span of wild oats.After-ripened seeds became dormant when soaked in soil at 60% moisture (limited oxygen). The development of dormancy was affected by temperature, duration of soaking, and drying of the seeds after soaking. The effect of drying was reversible and appeared to depend upon the amount of previous induction. Mortality increased markedly when soaking was prolonged at 25 °C. Increased mortality, resulting from repeated wetting and drying, only accounted for a small part of the losses observed in seeds on the soil surface.Interruption of imbibition (8 to 32 hours) by drying resulted in faster germination when seeds were rewetted.

To explore natural environments is to be confronted by variation, and the science of ecology is challenged by the persistent question: is this variation more than variation itself? Environmental variation can cause population fluctuations (Ripa et al. 1998), but can it do more than this? Does it affect how organisms interact with one another? Does it shape populations and communities? How and in what ways? Biologists firmly accept that variation shapes the organisms. Heritable variation is the engine of evolution, which is fuelled by environmental change. In life-history theory, it is widely accepted that organisms show adaptations to variation in the physical environment, exemplified by evolutionary theories of iteroparity and seed dormancy (Cohen 1966, Bulmer 1985, Ellner 1985a, Real and Ellner 1992).

https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2004.00843.x,‘Adaptive Dynamics’ vs. ‘adaptive dynamics’,"Various approaches that can be described as 'adaptive dynamics' arose from a need to describe the general features of evolutionary change under complex patterns of frequency dependence. Such frequency dependence often arises from ecological scenarios with several interacting species. Currently, the term, 'Adaptive Dynamics' (capitalized) is most often used to refer to a much more narrow body of theory based on models in which evolutionary change is mutation-limited and occurs on a time scale that is much slower than population dynamics. This note argues that the usefulness of all types of adaptive dynamics depends on their ability to provide approximate descriptions of systems in which their assumptions are not satisfied. The ability to approximate more complex situations can only be assessed by analysing more complex and realistic models. Some of Waxman and Gavrilets' criticisms of Adaptive Dynamics are based on unrealistic expectations from simple models, but they are probably correct in arguing that Adaptive Dynamics is insufficient to predict when sympatric speciation will occur. Community and ecosystem ecologists have largely ignored adaptive changes in the species that make up their objects of study. On the contrary, evolutionary ecologists have largely ignored adaptive change in all except for the simplest of ecological scenarios. These gaps have been noticed and commented on many times over the past several decades. Without some way of incorporating adaptive change into ecological models, their predictions are likely to be quite inaccurate, particularly for long-term change (Abrams, 1996; Thompson, 1998; Abrams & Vos, 2003; Matsuda & Abrams, 2004). Without some way of dealing with systems that have a reasonable number of species, evolutionary biology is unlikely to be able to explain spatial and temporal patterns in the characteristics of species that affect their interactions with other species (Brown & Vincent, 1992; Thompson, 1994, 1998; Abrams, 2000; Case & Taper, 2000; Day, 2000; Abrams & Chen, 2002). It is clear that we need to combine ecological and evolutionary models using a simplified description of the dynamics of adaptive change in traits that determine ecological interactions. This need applies to all forms of adaptation, from behavioural change, through developmental plasticity, to changes in gene frequency. Achieving a full understanding of any of these mechanisms of adaptive change is likely to require a spectrum of models. It is also likely that some common features apply to most mechanisms, and one can hope that a simple framework for modelling might capture those common features. In the following, 'adaptive dynamics' (lower case; henceforth abbreviated as 'ad') will be used to refer to the dynamics of any adaptively changing traits. 'Adaptive Dynamics' (upper case; henceforth abbreviated as 'AD') will refer to a specific set of methods for analysing mutation limited evolutionary change developed by Metz and colleagues (Metz et al. 1996; Dieckmann & Law, 1996; Geritz et al., 1997, 1998), and reviewed by Waxman & Gavrilets (2005). One objection to AD is its use of a very general term to describe a narrow spectrum of models of strictly evolutionary adaptation; a more modest appellation would be more appropriate. As the mean phenotypic characteristics of individuals are key parameters of most ecological models, what is needed, at a minimum, is a description of the dynamics of those average characteristics that display adaptive change. One potential form of adaptive dynamics, models of gene frequency change, might seem to provide the appropriate framework for modelling adaptive evolutionary change. However, dynamic models of gene frequency change have not proven useful in the context of complex ecological scenarios because of lack of knowledge of the genetic basis of ecological characters, and of the translation between genotype and phenotype. On a practical level, such models are simply too complicated to deal with complex multi-species or multi-locus problems. Lande (1976) introduced phenotypically-based quantitative genetic models to evolutionary theory, initiating a wide range of applications to various evolutionary problems. Because breeding values are generally approximately normally distributed, one can describe the character state of a population in terms of the mean and variance of traits of interest. Quantitative genetics provides simple recursion relationships for the dynamics of means, variances, and covariances; the latter two are often assumed to be approximately constant. However, the initial applications of quantitative genetic recursions centred on biological scenarios where fitnesses were independent of frequency. The phenotypic recursions have an extra term for most scenarios that are characterized by frequency dependent fitness (Lande, 1976), and this can complicate the analysis. However, an approximation to these recursions has a simple form and seems to be widely applicable (Iwasa et al., 1991; Taper & Case, 1992; Abrams et al., 1993; Taylor & Day, 1997; Gomulkiewicz, 1998; Case & Taper, 2000; Abrams, 2001, 2003). This approximation implies that the mean value of a trait changes at a rate approximately proportional to the slope of fitness as a function of an individual's trait (the individual's 'fitness gradient'). This slope is evaluated at the mean trait value in the population. Modifications are required when traits affecting different characters are correlated (Iwasa et al., 1991; Abrams et al., 1993). The approximation is most accurate when selection is relatively weak and the variance of the fitness function is greater than the variance of the phenotypic distribution of the character. In practice, the assumption is often reasonably good when some of these assumptions are violated (Abrams et al., 1993), although there are certainly some cases where the approximation is not adequate (Gomulkiewicz, 1998). Adaptive Dynamics assumes a particularly simple form for the underlying genetics. Populations are asexual and evolve by the replacement of nearly monomorphic populations by mutants having small phenotypic effects. This genetic model also produces phenotypic change that can be described by the fitness gradient dynamics described in the preceding paragraph. In this case, no approximations are required. However, the appearance of rigor is illusory, because the situations that might cause problems are not treated; selection is weak because the mutations have small effect, and phenotypic variance is assumed to be close to zero within a lineage. Evolution by the replacement of monomorphic populations by seldom-occurring mutations of small effect does not characterize change in ecologically important characters in most eukaryotes. To the extent that the results of AD models are useful in understanding natural patterns, it will usually be because the dynamics that are predicted are similar to those produced by a variety of other evolutionary mechanisms (Abrams, 2001). The remainder of this article addresses some of the limitations of AD and then argues that the simplifications of all adaptive dynamics approaches are not so extreme as to prevent them from contributing to understanding the evolution of interacting individuals and species. Does it matter that the underlying genetic assumptions of AD are seldom satisfied, given that AD often predicts the same form of phenotypic dynamics as a more general, but less rigorous, fitness-gradient approach? There are at least two circumstances where the AD assumptions are often seriously limiting or misleading. First, there are many cases where the stability of an equilibrium point hinges on the relative speeds of ecological and evolutionary (or other adaptive) processes (e.g. Abrams & Matsuda, 1997a, b; Abrams & Kawecki, 1999; Abrams, 1999; Ma et al., 2003). The assumption (made by AD) that evolutionary dynamics are very much slower than population dynamics is inappropriate here. In fact, evidence for rapid evolution is accumulating (Thompson, 1998; Hendry et al., 2000), and recent experiments (Yoshida et al., 2003) have confirmed earlier models (Abrams & Matsuda, 1997b) in showing that evolutionary change in prey can drive predator–prey population cycles. When there are population fluctuations because of any mechanism, selective pressures will almost always change over time, and the assumption of a separation of ecological and evolutionary times scales will often be misleading (Abrams, 1997). And, of course, slow adaptive dynamics never applies to cases where adaptation occurs via behaviour or developmental plasticity. The second problem with a literal application of AD arises at 'branching points'; locally stable evolutionary equilibria that involve disruptive selection. The possibility of such equilibria was noted by Eshel (1983) and further explored in the context of population genetics by Taylor (1989) and Christiansen (1991). Some of the many ecological circumstances leading to such equilibria were outlined by Wilson & Turelli (1986) and Abrams et al. (1993), and in much of the recent AD literature discussed in Waxman & Gavrilets (2005). Early AD works assumed that such points would result in a branching of the evolutionary lineage into two distinct lineages (i.e. de facto speciation), and later work argued that speciation at branching points could occur in diploid sexual models (e.g. Dieckmann & Doebeli, 1999; Geritz & Kisdi, 2000; Doebeli & Dieckmann, 2003). However, the conditions for splitting of the lineage remain controversial (Waxman & Gavrilets, 2005) and are often likely to be restrictive, as first pointed out by Felsenstein (1979). Abrams et al. (1993) suggested that ecological scenarios leading to branching points could often lead to situations in which traits that minimize fitness are evolutionarily stable. The disruptive selection characteristic of branching points has been demonstrated in 3-spined sticklebacks (Bolnick, 2004), in one of many lakes where branching of the original marine lineage has not occurred. Speciation is a question of genetic isolation, and generally requires a more detailed genetic model than do many other questions in evolutionary ecology. Assume we broaden the term AD to include all methods applying fitness-gradient dynamics, making it a broader subset of ad. Further assume that analysing evolutionary trajectories in the vicinity of branching points requires more detailed models to determine whether splitting of a lineage occurs. Are the assumptions of the method still so great that they invalidate its application to most ecological scenarios? It is admittedly rather unlikely that such simplified models will provide precise forecasts of evolutionary trajectories for any real biological system. However, they should enable us to understand at least some of the range of potential outcomes of perturbations to adaptively changing ecological systems. Certainly, the simplifications involved in such dynamics are no more extreme than the simplifications of most models in community ecology (homogeneous populations, no time lags, etc.). Of course, size- and age-structure and complicated, size-specific density dependence can alter the predictions of simple ecological models. This does not mean that simple models lacking these features are of no use in understanding the ecological process; simple models identify possible or probable outcomes in wider classes of complex models that cannot be analysed as thoroughly. Similarly, the simplifications involved in fitness gradient approaches are often likely to produce some quantitative errors for any particular system. However, these do not detract from the general insights that can be obtained. Waxman & Gavrilets (2005) are not justified in demanding that AD show that it makes empirically verifiable predictions that models with other genetic assumptions cannot easily make. Nor would this demand have been justified if applied to the more amorphous set of methods in ad. Simplified representations are necessary to understand complex scenarios in all areas of population biology. Such models would be useless if they made unique predictions that other models did not make. The diversity of biological systems poses a major problem for evolutionary and ecological theory. Specific assumptions are likely to be violated in a major way in most systems. This means that it is seldom advisable to restrict oneself to models or methods that achieve simplicity or compact representation at the cost of making highly specific assumptions. Biological questions, rather than a goal of consistency with a set of rules should motivate model development. The case of initially successful invasions that eventually result in extinction of the invader is a case in point (i.e. the 'resident strikes back' phenomenon of Mylius & Diekmann, 2001). Geritz et al. (2002) have gone to some lengths to characterize fitness functions for which this outcome will not occur. This is because the 'standard procedure' in AD has been to assume that initially successful mutants always replace residents. No such assumptions apply to a more general set of ordinary differential equations describing changes in populations and traits, with the latter using a fitness gradient approach. Here one only needs to be aware of the well-known result that invasion does not imply persistence [stressed in an ecological context by Armstrong & McGehee (1980) among many others]. It would be unfortunate if the popularity of the AD approach led to neglect of those scenarios where the resident can 'strike back'. At the same time, characterizing such scenarios using AD (as in Geritz et al., 2002) can provide guidance regarding the ecological circumstances where invasion analysis may be misleading in models that do not use the strict AD approach. The main message of this commentary is that using fitness-gradient-based dynamics to describe the mean values of frequency dependent traits can provide great insight into the combined action of adaptive change and population dynamics in biological communities. Phenomenological approaches based on game-theory (Brown & Vincent, 1987; Vincent et al., 1993; Nowak & Sigmund, 2004), phenotype-based quantitative genetic models (Lande, 1976; Taper & Case, 1992; Case & Taper, 2000) and AD (Geritz et al., 1998) all support the use of such dynamics as a rough approach to understanding evolutionary questions involving frequency dependence. There is a less rigorous but still persuasive case that many behavioural traits can also be roughly described by the same general family of models (Abrams et al., 1993; Taylor & Day, 1997; Ma et al., 2003; Abrams & Matsuda, 2004). However, there seems to be no compelling reason to restrict the application of such fitness-gradient models to cases in which evolution proceeds by replacement of wild types by infrequently occurring mutants of small effect. And, as is true of all theory, more detailed models will often be needed to refine predictions for particular questions (e.g. speciation), particular species (e.g. those with size-related changes in ecological interactions and flexible growth), or particular evolutionary scenarios (e.g. narrow fitness functions and/or very strong selection).",W1562539700,False,0.5639325976371765

This chapter reviews the history of the search for generalities in the structure of complex food webs, and discusses current and future research trends. Analysis of food-web structure has used empirical and modeling approaches, and has been inspired both by questions from ecology such as “What factors promote stability of complex ecosystems given internal dynamics and external perturbations?” and questions from network research such as “Do food webs display universal structure similar to other types of networks?” Recent research has suggested that once variable diversity and connectance are taken into account, there are universal coarse-grained characteristics of how trophic links and species defined according to trophic function are distributed within food webs.

However, low awareness, variable interpretation, and inconsistent application of these guidelines can lead to confusion and a lack of transparency when recognizing those who merit authorship. This article describes a research project led by the Medical Publishing Insights and Practices (MPIP) Initiative to identify current challenges when determining authorship for industry-sponsored clinical trials and develop an improved approach to facilitate decision-making when recognizing authors from related publications. A total of 498 clinical investigators, journal editors, publication professionals and medical writers were surveyed to understand better how they would adjudicate challenging, real-world authorship case scenarios, determine the perceived frequency of each scenario and rate their confidence in the responses provided. Multiple rounds of discussions about these results with journal editors, clinical investigators and industry representatives led to the development of key recommendations intended to enhance transparency when determining authorship. These included forming a representative group to establish authorship criteria early in a trial, having all trial contributors agree to these criteria and documenting trial contributions to objectively determine who warrants an invitation to participate in the manuscript development process. The resulting Five-step Authorship Framework is designed to create a more standardized approach when determining authorship for clinical trial publications. Overall, these recommendations aim to facilitate more transparent authorship decisions and help readers better assess the credibility of results and perspectives of the authors for medical research more broadly.

To investigate authorship trends across a number of periodicals, we performed a descriptive study comparing two full years of published articles spaced ten years apart from five medical journals.Physician reviewers each reviewed all articles of one medical journal for the 1995 and 2005 publication years. Reviewed journals included Academic Emergency Medicine (AEM), Annals of Emergency Medicine (AnnEM), Annals of Internal Medicine (AIM), Journal of Trauma (JT), and New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Data collected for each article were number of authors, ordinal number of the corresponding author, type of study described, whether the described study was a multicenter trial, whether authorship listed included a ""study group,"" and whether any author was also an editor of the journal.A total of 2927 articles were published in the five journals in 1995, and of these, 1401 (47.9%) were analyzed after the exclusion criteria had been applied; for 2005 a total of 3630 articles were published and of these, 1351 (37.2%) were included in the analysis. Across all five journals the mean number of authors per article increased from 4.66 to 5.73 between 1995 and 2005 (P < 0.0001), and four of the five journals individually had statistically significant increases in the number of authors per article. More articles had a journal editor as an author in 2005 (increased from 7.8% to 11.0%, P = 0.004), though no single journal had a statistically significant increase.We describe a trend of increasing mean authors, editorial authorship, study groups, and multicenter trials over time with fewer solo authors now publishing original research or case reports.

Cyclic stretch induced a rapid (within 5 min) increase in extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation in AEC. The inhibition of Na(+), L-type Ca(2+) and stretch-activated ion channels with amiloride, nifedipine, and gadolinium did not prevent the stretch-induced ERK1/2 activation. The inhibition of Grb2-SOS interaction with an SH3 binding sequence peptide, Ras with a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, and Raf-1 with forskolin did not affect the stretch-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Moreover, cyclic stretch did not increase Ras activity, suggesting that stretch-induced ERK1/2 activation is independent of the classical receptor tyrosine kinase-MAPK pathway. Pertussis toxin and two specific epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors (AG-1478 and PD-153035) prevented the stretch-induced ERK1/2 activation.

Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were subjected to an average of 6 or 10% strain at a rate of 60 cycles/min for up to 4 h. Cyclic strain caused strain- and time-dependent phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/ERK2. Peak phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/ERK2 induced by 10% strain were at 10 min.

Treatment of BAEC with 2,5-di- tert-butyl-1,4-benzohydroquinone, to deplete inositol trisphosphate-sensitive calcium storage, and gadolinium chloride, a Ca 2+ channel blocker, did not inhibit the activation of ERK1/ERK2. Strain-induced ERK1/ERK2 activation was partly inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C and completely inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. These data suggest that 1) ERK1/ERK2 are not critically involved in the strain-induced cell proliferation and orientation, 2) strain-dependent activation of ERK1/ERK2 is independent of intracellular and extracellular calcium mobilization, and 3) protein kinase C activation and tyrosine kinase regulate strain-induced activation of ERK1/ERK2.",W1775230489,False,0.0006853558588773012

Autoradiographic analysis showed a 42-kDa protein labeled for cells exposed to 12 cycles of 3% strain or 6 cycles of 6% strain over 60 s (strain rate of 1.2%/s), whereas 6 cycles of 3% strain (0.6%/s) elicited no measurable response. To further investigate the role of strain rate, a single 6% cycle over 10 or 60 s (1.2% and 0.2%/s, respectively) was applied, with the more rapid cycle stimulating AAGTP binding, whereas the lower strain rate showed no response. In cells subjected to a single 6% cycle/10 s, immunoprecipitation identified the AAGTP-labeled 42-kDa band as the G protein subunits Gα q and Gα i1.

In a final plenary meeting, we brought ideas together, discussed open topics, identified consensus or differences of opinion, and prepared a preliminary report. Results: Our lists of topics were highly similar, suggesting that we missed only a few topics. We agreed that it is important to consider hybridization in both its genetic and ecological context and with explicit attention paid to phylogenetic and biogeographic history. It is also necessary to distinguish between underlying processes and resulting consequences. Knowledge of the consequences of hybridization is more developed in genetics than in ecology.

Spillover from such programs can cause unintended fitness and demographic consequences for wild conspecifics. The range of possible management practices to minimize such consequences vary in their control of genetic and demographic processes. Here, we use a model of coupled genetic and demographic dynamics to evaluate alternative management approaches to minimizing unintended consequences of aquaculture escapees. We find that, if strong natural selection occurs between escape and reproduction, an extremely maladapted (i.e., nonlocal-origin, highly domesticated) stock could have fitness consequences analogous to a weakly diverged cultured stock; otherwise, wild population fitness declines with increasing maladaptation in the cultured stock. Reducing escapees through low-level leakage is more effective than reducing an analogous number of escapees from large, rare pulses. This result arises because low-level leakage leads to the continual lowering of wild population fitness and subsequent increased proportional contribution of maladapted cultured escapees to the total population. Increased sterilization efficacy can cause rapid, nonlinear reductions in unintended fitness consequences. Finally, sensitivity to the stage of escape indicates a need for improved monitoring data on how the number of escapees varies across life cycle stages.",W1508881225,False,0.5666009783744812

The infinitesimal model can accommodate nonnormality and a nonconstant genetic variance as a result of linkage disequilibrium. It can be seen as a parsimonious one-parameter model that approximates the underlying genetic details well when a large number of loci are involved. Here, the performance of this model is compared to several more realistic explicit multilocus models, with either two, several or a large number of alleles per locus with unequal effect sizes. Predictions for the deviation of the population mean from the optimum are highly similar across the different models, so that the non-Gaussian infinitesimal model forms a good approximation. It does, however, generally estimate a higher genetic variance than the multilocus models, with the difference decreasing with an increasing number of loci. The difference between multilocus models depends more strongly on the effective number of loci, accounting for relative contributions of loci to the variance, than on the number of alleles per locus.",W1484616739,False,0.030634893104434013

The results are relevant for novel introductions and for an established population whose existence is threatened by a sudden change in the environment. The models span a range of genetic assumptions, including identical loci that contribute to absolute fitness, a two-locus quantitative genetic model with nonidentical loci, and a model with major and minor genes affecting a quantitative trait. We find as a general (though not universal) pattern that prospects for persistence narrow as more loci contribute to fitness, in effect because selection per locus is increasingly weakened with more loci, which can even overwhelm any initial enhancement of fitness that adding loci might provide. When loci contribute unequally to fitness, genes of small effect can significantly reduce extinction risk. Indeed, major and minor genes can interact synergistically to reduce the time needed to evolve growth. Such interactions can also increase vulnerability to extinction, depending not just on how genes interact but also on the initial genetic structure of the introduced, or newly invaded, population.",W1565386195,False,0.15628327429294586
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01949.x,Evaluating Alternative Strategies for Minimizing Unintended Fitness Consequences of Cultured Individuals on Wild Populations,"Abstract Artificial propagation strategies often incur selection in captivity that leads to traits that are maladaptive in the wild. For propagation programs focused on production rather than demographic contribution to wild populations, effects on wild populations can occur through unintentional escapement or the need to release individuals into natural environments for part of their life cycle. In this case, 2 alternative management strategies might reduce unintended fitness consequences on natural populations: (1) reduce selection in captivity as much as possible to reduce fitness load (keep them similar), or (2) breed a separate population to reduce captive‐wild interactions as much as possible (make them different). We quantitatively evaluate these 2 strategies with a coupled demographic–genetic model based on Pacific salmon hatcheries that incorporates a variety of relevant processes and dynamics: selection in the hatchery relative to the wild, assortative mating based on the trait under selection, and different life cycle arrangements in terms of hatchery release, density dependence, natural selection, and reproduction. Model results indicate that, if natural selection only occurs between reproduction and captive release, the similar strategy performs better. However, if natural selection occurs between captive release and reproduction, the different and similar strategies present viable alternatives to reducing unintended fitness consequences because of the greater opportunity to purge maladaptive individuals. In this case, the appropriate approach depends on the feasibility of each strategy and the demographic goal (e.g., increasing natural abundance, or ensuring that a high proportion of natural spawners are naturally produced). In addition, the fitness effects of hatchery release are much greater if hatchery release occurs before (vs. after) density‐dependent interactions. Given the logistical challenges to achieving both the similar and different strategies, evaluation of not just the preferred strategy but also the consequences of failing to achieve the desired target is critical.

However, despite the consensus that demographic and genetic mechanisms are both involved and interact in the process of extinction, few attempts have been made to examine their combined impacts on population viability in a particular species. We integrated specific data resulting from 10‐year multidisciplinary investigations into a descriptive model to simulate the dynamics of an introduced population of the rare self‐incompatible plant species Centaurea corymbosa. The model allowed us to examine the interplay between demographic processes and genetic self‐incompatibility in the particular habitat conformation of the species, alternating suitable and unsuitable sites within a population along cliffs. Population growth and extinction risk were compared for different introduction strategies. Population persistence mainly depended on the number of introduced seeds and on their initial spatial distribution within the population (single vs. multisite introduction). In most cases, a multisite introduction resulted in faster population growth and higher viability than a single‐site introduction. As expected, a strong negative impact of the self‐incompatibility system was observed on population dynamics and viability. However, because of positive feedback between demographic and genetic processes, this impact differed among introduction strategies: it was less severe when seeds were distributed among suitable sites, which also limited the loss of self‐incompatibility alleles. Moreover, self‐incompatibility contributed to the positive relationship between flowering plant density and fertilization rate. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide strong management guidelines for future introductions of C. corymbosa regarding the number of seeds required (&gt; 800) and the benefits of introducing them into several sites to achieve population persistence. Further, the study highlights the general importance of integrating demography and genetics to compare the effectiveness of different management strategies.",W1504583986,False,0.8967258930206299

As described in Ewald (1994a, p. 184), the Renaissance thinker Girolamo Fracastoro hypothesized that disease-specific germs could multiply within a person's body and be transmitted either directly over short distances, or over long distances (e.g., via contaminated objects). In recent years, a number of authors have emphasized how many epidemiological phenomena cannot be understood without explicitly considering infectious processes in a spatial context (e.g., Holmes 1997). There are several general issues that arise automatically when spatial aspects of the dynamics of infectious disease are considered. For instance, if infections are localized, spatial separation increases the degrees of freedom of a host–parasite system, permitting a rich array of dynamical behaviors to arise even in a spatially homogeneous world (e.g., Hassell et al. 1994). Moreover, spatial heterogeneity is the norm rather than the exception in ecological systems (Williamson 1981). Dispersal often couples habitats that differ strongly in local population parameters (e.g., carrying capacity), or involve anisotropic spatial flows. This leads to the potential for asymmetries among habitats in the degree of the impact of spatial coupling on local ecological and evolutionary dynamics.",W1522557550,False,0.8820084929466248

We first present statistical methods for analyzing the infinitesimal model, in which offspring breeding values are normally distributed around the mean of the parents, with fixed variance. These show that the usual assumption of a Gaussian distribution of breeding values in the population gives remarkably accurate predictions for the mean and the variance, even when disruptive selection generates substantial deviations from normality. We then set out a general genetic analysis of selection and recombination. The population is represented by multilocus cumulants describing the distribution of haploid genotypes, and selection is described by the relation between mean fitness and these cumulants. We provide exact recursions in terms of generating functions for the effects of selection on non-central moments. The effects of recombination are simply calculated as a weighted sum over all the permutations produced by meiosis. Finally, the new cumulants that describe the next generation are computed from the non-central moments. Although this scheme is applied here in detail only to selection on an additive trait, it is quite general. For arbitrary epistasis and linkage, we describe a consistent infinitesimal limit in which the short-term selection response is dominated by infinitesimal allele frequency changes and linkage disequilibria. Numerical multilocus results show that the standard Gaussian approximation gives accurate predictions for the dynamics of the mean and genetic variance in this limit. Even with intense truncation selection, linkage disequilibria of order three and higher never cause much deviation from normality. Thus, the empirical deviations frequently found between predicted and observed responses to artificial selection are not caused by linkage-disequilibrium-induced departures from normality. Disruptive selection can generate substantial four-way disequilibria, and hence kurtosis; but even then, the Gaussian assumption predicts the variance accurately. In contrast to the apparent simplicity of the infinitesimal limit, data suggest that changes in genetic variance after 10 or more generations of selection are likely to be dominated by allele frequency dynamics that depend on genetic details.",W1852226811,False,0.00431466568261385

This leads to clonal offspring. In rare cases, however, this gynogenesis is leaky, and paternal DNA in the form of small supernumerary chromosomes is included into the maternal genome. We have obtained a clone where one such microchromosome contains a pigmentary locus, resulting in macromelanophore pigmentation of the carrier.

Snake venoms, in particular, have evolved a wide diversity of peptides and proteins that induce harmful inflammatory and neurotoxic effects including severe pain and paralysis, hemotoxic effects, such as hemorrhage and coagulopathy, and cytotoxic/myotoxic effects, such as inflammation and necrosis. If untreated, many envenomings result in death or severe morbidity in humans and, despite advances in management, snakebite remains a major public health problem, particularly in developing countries. Consequently, the World Health Organization recently recognized snakebite as a neglected tropical disease that affects ~2.7 million p.a. The major protein classes found in snake venoms are phospholipases, metalloproteases, serine proteases and three-finger peptides. The mechanisms of action and pharmacological properties of many snake venom toxins have been elucidated, revealing a complex multifunctional cocktail that can act synergistically to rapidly immobilize prey and deter predators. However, despite these advances many snake toxins remain to be structurally and pharmacologically characterized.

We investigated the ability of BaP1, a metalloproteinase from Bothrops asper snake venom, with structural homology to MMPs, to induce joint hypernociception.Animals received intra-articular (i.art.) BaP1. Hypernociception was assessed using the rat-knee joint articular incapacitation test. Cell influx, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), and TNF-alpha levels were assessed in joint exudates following BaP1 injection.BaP1 (5 microg per joint) provoked hypernociception between 1 and 6 h after i.art. injection. Cell influx, mostly neutrophils, was maximal 3 h after BaP1 i.art. injection. BaP1 also led to increase in PGE(2) and TNF-alpha levels in the joint exudates. Pretreatment with either indomethacin (4 mg.kg(-1) i.p.) or with an anti-TNF-alpha antiserum (i.art.) significantly inhibited both BaP1-induced joint hypernociception and cell influx. In isolated rat peritoneal macrophages, BaP1 increased cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression, while not altering that of COX-1.This is the first demonstration that a metalloproteinase promotes joint hypernociception. This effect involves local release of PGE(2) and TNF-alpha. BaP1-induced increase in PGE(2) is associated to increased COX-2 expression in macrophages. Blocking PGE(2) or TNF-alpha inhibits BaP1-induced hypernociception.

This enzyme exerts multiple tissue‐damaging activities, including hemorrhage, myonecrosis, dermonecrosis, blistering, and edema. BaP1 is a single chain of 202 amino acids that shows highest sequence identity with metalloproteinases isolated from the venoms of snakes of the subfamily Crotalinae. It has six Cys residues involved in three disulfide bridges (Cys 117–Cys 197, Cys 159–Cys 181, Cys 157–Cys 164). It has the consensus sequence H 142 E 143 XXH 146 XXGXXH 152, as well as the sequence C 164 I 165 M 166, which characterize the “metzincin” superfamily of metalloproteinases. The active‐site cleft separates a major subdomain (residues 1–152), comprising four α‐helices and a five‐stranded β‐sheet, from the minor subdomain, which is formed by a single α‐helix and several loops.

Observations of this type go against accepted wisdom that ecological and evolutionary dynamics occur at very different time scales. While some authors have evaluated the rapidity of a measured evolutionary rate by comparing it to the overall distribution of measured evolutionary rates, we believe that ecologists are mainly interested in rapid evolution because of its potential to impinge on ecological processes. We therefore propose that rapid evolution be defined as a genetic change occurring rapidly enough to have a measurable impact on simultaneous ecological change. Using this definition we propose a framework for decomposing rates of ecological change into components driven by simultaneous evolutionary change and by change in a non‐evolutionary factor (e.g. density dependent population dynamics, abiotic environmental change). Evolution is judged to be rapid in this ecological context if its contribution to ecological change is large relative to the contribution of other factors. We provide a worked example of this approach based on a theoretical predator–prey interaction [ Abrams, P. &amp; Matsuda, H. (1997). Evolution, 51, 1740], and find that in this system the impact of prey evolution on predator per capita growth rate is 63% that of internal ecological dynamics. We then propose analytical methods for measuring these contributions in field situations, and apply them to two long‐term data sets for which suitable ecological and evolutionary data exist. For both data sets relatively high rates of evolutionary change have been found when measured as character change in standard deviations per generation (haldanes). For Darwin's finches evolving in response to fluctuating rainfall [ Grant, P.R. &amp; Grant, B.R. (2002). Science, 296, 707], we estimate that evolutionary change has been more rapid than ecological change by a factor of 2.2. For a population of freshwater copepods whose life history evolves in response to fluctuating fish predation [ Hairston, N.G. Jr &amp; Dillon, T.A. (1990). Evolution, 44, 1796], we find that evolutionary change has been about one quarter the rate of ecological change – less than in the finch example, but nevertheless substantial. These analyses support the view that in order to understand temporal dynamics in ecological processes it is critical to consider the extent to which the attributes of the system under investigation are simultaneously changing as a result of rapid evolution.",W1541870771,False,0.8077163100242615

And science is beginning to agree. Researchers have demonstrated that both domesticated and non domesticated animals - from invertebrates to monkeys and apes - behave in consistently different ways, meeting the criteria for what many define as personality. But why the differences, and how are personalities shaped by genes and environment? How did they evolve? The essays in Animal Personalities reveal that there is much to learn from our furred and feathered friends. The study of animal personality is one of the fastest-growing areas of research in behavioral and evolutionary biology. Here Claudio Carere and Dario Maestripieri, along with a host of scholars from fields as diverse as ecology, genetics, endocrinology, neuroscience, and psychology, provide a comprehensive overview of the current research on animal personality. Grouped into thematic sections, chapters approach the topic with empirical and theoretical material and show that to fully understand why personality exists, we must consider the evolutionary processes that give rise to personality, the ecological correlates of personality differences, and the physiological mechanisms underlying personality variation.",W1486334949,False,0.6564161777496338
https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780195121834.001.0001,Adaptive Genetic Variation In The Wild,"Abstract Two of the great mysteries of biology yet to be explored concern the distribution and abundance of genetic variation in natural populations and the genetic architecture of complex traits. These are tied together by their relationship to natural selection and evolutionary history, and some of the keys to disclosing these secrets lie in the study of wild organisms in their natural environments. This book, featuring a superb selection of papers from leading authors, summarizes the state of current understanding about the extent of genetic variation within wild populations and the ways to monitor such variation. It proposes the idea that a fundamental objective of evolutionary ecology is necessary to predict organism, population, community, and ecosystem response to environmental change. In fact, the overall theme of the papers centers around the expression of genetic variation and how it is shaped by the action of natural selection in the natural environment. Patterns of adaptation in the past and the genetic basis of traits likely to be under selection in a dynamically changing environment is discussed along with a wide variety of techniques to test for genetic variation and its consequences, ranging from classical demography to the use of molecular markers. This book is perfect for professionals and graduate students in genetics, biology, ecology, conservation biology, and evolution.",W1520946653,False,0.8092605471611023

CPT activities in these tissues of hagfish (Eptatretus stouti) are approximately 10% the rate in teleosts. However, the maximal activities of the beta-oxidation enzyme beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD) in dogfish red muscle and heart are similar to these tissues in the other species. This paradox prompted a more detailed study on the capacity of mitochondria from dogfish cardiac and red skeletal muscles to utilize fatty acids, possibly by a CPT-independent pathway. Free fatty acids were not oxidized by mitochondria from red muscle (hexanoate, octanoate, decanoate, and palmitate) or from heart (octanoate, palmitate). Neither hyposmotic incubation nor addition of 5 mM ATP could stimulate oxidation of octanoate or palmitate in either preparation, suggesting that these tissues have little capacity to oxidize fatty acids by a carnitine-independent pathway. Palmitoyl carnitine oxidation was detectable at very low rates in these mitochondria only with hyposmotic incubation. Octanoyl carnitine was oxidized at greater rates than palmitoyl carnitine, 10% the rate of pyruvate in both tissues, suggesting that medium-chain fatty acids could be physiologically relevant fuels in elasmobranchs if available to heart and red muscle. One potential source of medium-chain fatty acids is hepatic peroxisomal beta-oxidation, which occurs in dogfish liver at maximal activities similar to carp and trout liver. However, based on relative rates of oxidation, it is likely that dogfish heart and red muscle metabolism are fueled primarily by carbohydrate and ketone bodies.",W1878985896,False,0.39933153986930847

It was found that the oxygen function was introduced at position ω6 in all of the fatty acids which reacted. In one case a small amount of the substrate was oxygenated in position ω10. The structural requirement for substrates is the presence of a cis, cis-1,4-pentadiene group with its methylene group located in position ω8. The structure of the hydroperoxy acid formed from 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid was 15l-hydroperoxy-8(cis), 11(cis),13(trans)-eicosatrienoic acid. By using sterospecifically tritium-labeled 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acids, it was found that the removal of hydrogen from the ω8 methylene group is stereospecific. Thus, only the hydrogen of the l configuration is removed by the enzyme during the conversion into 15l-hydroperoxy-8(cis), 11(cis),13(trans)-eicosatrienoic acid. The conversion of [13l-3H, 3-14C]8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid is accompanied by an isotope effect, suggesting that the hydrogen removal occurs as the initial step of the reaction.",W1531198291,False,0.0018841278506442904

Despite intensive efforts, the development of effective vaccines or immunotherapies against these diseases has largely remained unsuccessful, asking for the exploration of new aspects of the host response to these pathogens. Genetic studies have demonstrated beyond doubt that cell-mediated mechanisms of host defense involving innate immunity and T cells are of crucial importance for the control of these diseases. By contrast, the role of B cells during intracellular bacterial infection has so far received little attention besides their role as antibody-producing cells. However, the general knowledge of B-cell immunology and in particular of their antibody-independent functions has greatly increased during the last years. Recently, it was found in a model of Salmonella typhimurium infection that Toll-like receptor triggering on B cells resulted through interleukin-10 secretion in a marked suppression of innate defense mechanisms ultimately leading to uncontrolled growth of the bacteria and earlier death from the disease during both primary and secondary infections. This article reviews the protective and deleterious roles of B cells during intracellular bacterial infections and discusses how manipulating their antibody-independent functions may be a powerful means to therapeutically improve host resistance against these diseases.",W1526240011,False,0.0005021223914809525

Despite that crucial effector function, the killing mechanism and uptake of granulysin into target cells have not been well investigated. To this end we analyzed granulysin binding, uptake, and the subsequent lysis of intracellular Listeria innocua in human DC. Recombinant granulysin was found to be actively taken up by DC into early endosomal Ag 1-labeled endosomes, as detected by immunofluorescence. Further transfer to L. innocua-containing phagosomes was indicated by colocalization of bacterial DNA with granulysin. After uptake of granulysin by DC, lysis of L. innocua was found in a dose-dependent manner. Uptake as well as lysis of Listeria were inhibited after blocking endocytosis by lowering the temperature and by cholesterol depletion of DC. Colocalization of granulysin with cholera toxin during uptake showed binding to and internalization via lipid rafts. In contrast to cholera toxin, which was targeted to the perinuclear compartment, granulysin was found exclusively in endosomal-phagosomal vesicles.

Bb are transmitted by ticks to the skin, which is particularly rich in dendritic cells (DC). The initial reaction of these APCs may already set the course to immune pathogenesis. To study the role of DC, biopsies from human skin were incubated with Bb and investigated in toto with electron microscopy. In addition, DC freshly isolated from dermis (DDC) and epidermis (Langerhans cells) were compared with blood-derived DC (BDC). In situ, Bb were found in the dermal layer of the skin only, occasionally cleared by DDC. Isolated DDC and BDC, but not Langerhans cells, readily engulfed Bb preferentially using coiling phagocytosis. Internalized Bb were located free in the cytosol and inside of phagolysosomes of DDC and BDC. Intravesicular Bb Ags were colocalized with MHC class II molecules. In addition, live Bb induced IL-12 production in BDC. Bb-pulsed BDC activated naive and primed autologous Bb-specific T cells, as measured by detection of granulocyte-macrophage CSF gene transcription and proliferative response, respectively. These data indicate that human DC phagocytose, process, and present Bb Ags.

https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1462-5822.2000.00066.x,Subversion of a young phagosome: the survival strategies of intracellular pathogens. Microreview,"Infection by intracellular pathogens remains a major cause of human diseases and death worldwide. The emergence of various resistant microbe strains associated to the problem of multidrug resistance emphasizes the urgency of finding new approaches to fight intracellular pathogens. Despite the severity of this health problem, it is surprising to realize that, until recently, little was known about the molecular mechanisms taking place at the subcellular level during host–pathogen interaction. Hopefully, a significant body of data has accumulated in the past few years and contributed to the birth of a new field at the frontier of microbiology and cell biology, cellular microbiology ( Falkow, 1999). This interest has widened our understanding of the strategies used by microorganisms to survive in mammalian cells. Recent reviews have described with details the survival strategies of intracellular pathogens within their host cells ( Finlay and Falkow, 1997; Sinai and Joiner, 1997; Aderem and Underhill, 1999; Dermine and Desjardins, 1999; Méresse et al., 1999a ). Here, we will discuss mainly the mechanisms and molecules involved in phagolysosome biogenesis, and those used by intracellular pathogens to subvert the properties of host cell phagosomes and avoid the encounter with the harsh environment of phagolysosomes. We will also present some of the new approaches and technical developments that are likely to have a significant impact in our ability to decode and expose the subversive strategies of intracellular pathogens. Intracellular pathogens are internalized and sequestered within their host cells in membrane compartments originating from the plasma membrane. Despite its plurality, in order to simplify the description of this process, this internalization step is generally referred to as phagocytosis, leading to the formation of phagosomes ( Swanson and Baer, 1995). Phagosomes are pivotal organelles in the ability of mammalian cells, including professional and non-professional phagocytes, to restrict the establishment and spread of infectious diseases ( Rabinovitch, 1995). Understanding how phagosomes work is of prime importance to develop new approaches to fight intracellular pathogens. Newly formed phagosomes are immature organelles unable to kill and degrade microorganisms. In order to acquire and exert their microbicidal function, phagosomes must engage in a maturation process referred to as phagolysosome biogenesis ( Berón et al., 1995 ; Desjardins, 1995). This process has been more extensively described in macrophage cell lines fed with inert particles such as zymozan, latex beads or fixed Staphylococcus aureus, and more recently using different in vitro assays. Newly formed phagosomes display a composition similar to that of the plasma membrane from which they originate ( Lang et al., 1988 ). Rapidly after their formation, phagosomes modify their composition by recycling plasma membrane molecules ( Muller et al., 1983 ), including the FcII and mannose receptors, and by acquiring markers of the early endocytic pathway such as Rab5 and EEA1 ( Pitt et al., 1992a ; Desjardins et al., 1994a ; Scianimanico et al., 1999 ; Steele-Mortimer et al., 1999 ). The acquisition of early markers is believed to confer to phagosomes properties normally assigned to early endosomes, including the ability to fuse with other endocytic organelles ( Desjardins, 1995). Indeed, phagosomes have been shown to fuse sequentially with endosomes of increasing age or of increasing maturation level (early endosomes, late endosomes and lysosomes) both in cultured cells and in cell-free assays ( Desjardins et al., 1997 ; Jahraus et al., 1998 ). During this process, phagosomes acquire markers of late endosomes and lysosomes, including LAMP molecules, the proton pump ATPase, the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), MHC class II molecules, as well as various hydrolases including several members of the cathepsin family ( Pitt et al., 1992a ; Desjardins et al., 1994a ; Jahraus et al., 1994 ; Oh and Swanson, 1996; Claus et al., 1998 ; Ramachandra et al., 1999a ). Although the bulk of these hydrolases is assumed to be present in late endosomes and lysosomes, their sequential acquisition by phagosomes suggests that they are transferred to this organelle through sequential fusion with subsets of endosomes containing various levels of hydrolases ( Claus et al., 1998 ). For example, the bulk of cathepsin H activity has been found on early endosomes. Maturation of phagosomes is also accompanied by the acquisition of the membrane protein Nramp1, an ion transporter that confers to macrophages resistance to infection by unrelated pathogens including Mycobacteria, Salmonella and Leishmania ( Gruenheid et al., 1997 ). Changes in phospholipid composition is also observed during phagosome maturation ( Desjardins et al., 1994b ). While early phagosomes are enriched with phosphatidylcholine, late phagosomes are preferentially enriched with sphingomyelin. Altogether, these changes contribute to the formation of the phagolysosome, an acidic compartment displaying the harsh and lytic environment needed to kill, degrade and further process microorganism antigens for presentation at the cell surface (see Harding, 1995; Ramachandra et al., 1999b ). The molecules and mechanisms allowing (i) the sequential fusion of phagosomes with various endocytic organelles, (ii) the maturation of phagosomes and (iii) the maintenance of phagosomes and endosomes integrity during this process begin to be understood. The molecular machinery governing membrane interactions has been extensively studied in the past 10 years, including that of the endocytic apparatus (for a review see Novick and Zerial, 1997; Haas, 1998a; Gonzalez and Scheller, 1999; Pfeffer, 1999). Membrane interactions are regulated by Rab GTPases and their effectors, and by SNARE proteins which appear to act in conjunction to allow organelle movement, docking, fusion and fission ( McBride et al., 1999 ). A variety of Rab proteins and SNARE molecules have been identified on phagosomes, including Rab4, Rab5, Rab7 and Rab11 ( Desjardins et al., 1994a ; Mosleh et al., 1998 ; Cox et al. 2000 ), synaptobrevin I and II, and NSF ( Desjardins et al., 1997 ), as well as syntaxin 2, 3 and 4 ( Hackam et al., 1996 ). The Rab5 effectors EEA1 ( Scianimanico et al., 1999 ; Steele-Mortimer et al., 1999 ) and Rabaptin5 (M. Desjardins, unpublished observation) have also been identified on phagosomes. All the above proteins have been shown to be present on endosomes. This clearly indicates that mechanisms governing membrane interactions along the endocytic pathway apply to phagosome fusion. Using in vitro fusion assays, Stahl and colleagues (see Berón et al., 1995 ; Funato et al., 1997 ) as well as Griffiths and colleagues ( Jahraus et al., 1998 ) were able to demonstrate the involvement of small GTPases and SNARE molecules in endosome–phagosome fusion. The presence of certain of these proteins on the phagosome membrane allows to speculate about some of its specialized function. Rab5 and its effectors enable fusion with early endosomes ( Alvarez-Dominguez and Stahl, 1999), while Rab7 would allow phagosome fusion with late endocytic organelles ( Méresse et al., 1995 ). Although the early endosome localization of Rab5 has been challenged recently and extended to late endosomes and lysosomes ( Jahraus et al., 1998 ), several studies have confirmed the preferential association of this molecule to early endocytic and phagocytic compartments (see Deretic et al., 1997 ). The gradual loss of Rab5 and acquisition of Rab7 on phagosomes with time would favour fusion with late endosomes and drive the transformation of phagosomes towards phagolysosomes ( Desjardins et al., 1994a ; 1997). Retrieving of molecules from phagosomes ( Pitt et al., 1992b ) would be made possible by recycling processes enabled by Rab4 and Rab11 ( Cox et al. 2000 ), previously localized to recycling endosomes ( Ullrich et al., 1996 ). In addition to their essential role in fusion, rab proteins might also be involved in determining the specificity of the fusion event. Recently, the early endocytic marker EEA1, a Rab5 effector, has been shown to interact with components of the SNARE fusion machinery ( McBride et al., 1999 ). Because EEA1 is exclusively found on early endocytic organelles, and is a specific effector of Rab5, this suggests that the interaction with EEA1 would confer a directionality to the fusion reaction. The intense search for the identification of components regulating fusion along the endocytic pathway should help us to further understand the mechanistic of phagolysosome biogenesis. The study of phagolysosome biogenesis in macrophages has allowed us to describe a particular type of interaction occurring between phagosomes and endocytic organelles. As an organelle, the phagolysosome was believed to originate from the fusion of a newly formed phagosome with a lysosome in a single, complete, fusion event (see Rabinowitz et al., 1992 ). Several observations indicated that phagolysosome biogenesis is instead driven by series of transient interactions between phagosomes and endocytic organelles ( Desjardins et al., 1994a ). According to the kiss and run hypothesis ( Desjardins, 1995; Storrie and Desjardins, 1996), phagosomes and endosomes move along cytoskeletal elements and interact at focal points were fusion events can occur. Cell-free assays confirmed the ability of phagosomes to move along microtubules in a bidirectional movement, towards the plus and minus ends ( Blocker et al., 1997 ). Once at close proximity, the outer leaflet of the phagosome and endosome membrane can fuse and induce the formation of a fusion pore, which expands enough to allow the exchange of the soluble content of these organelles. However, instead of being followed by the complete fusion of both organelles, the fusion pore closes and organelles separate, free to engage in another cycle of fusion. On this base, the kiss and run hypothesis predicted that the exchange of content between phagosomes and endosomes had to be size selective ( Desjardins, 1995). Studies performed in macrophage cell lines showed that endosomes containing gold particles of different sizes were in fact able to selectively transfer to phagosomes their smaller particles, clearly indicating that complete mixing of both organelles was not occurring ( Desjardins et al., 1997 ). The exact mechanisms allowing transient membrane interaction and fusion are not well known. Models predict that lipidic pores could expand irreversibly or remain open for several seconds and then close ( Monck and Fernandez, 1996). Closure of these lipidic pores could be caused by slight changes in lipid composition ( Nanavati et al., 1992 ). Interestingly, as mentioned above, the lipid composition of phagosomes is modified during maturation ( Desjardins et al., 1994b ). During maturation, the size-selective stringency of the kiss and run process also increases, as shown by the finding that late phagosomes were more restrictive than early phagosomes in the size of particles they can receive from endosomes ( Desjardins et al., 1997 ). Because Rab proteins have been described as 'molecular switches' ( Bourne et al., 1990 ), they were highlighted as potential regulators of the kiss and run fusion (see Fig. 1, lower panel). Recent studies support a role for Rab proteins, and particularly Rab5, in the regulation of the transient kiss and run interactions occurring between endosomes and phagosomes. First, the Rab5 GTPase activity acts as a timer that determines the frequency of membrane docking/fusion events ( Rybin et al., 1996 ). Second, Rab5 accumulates at focal points on endosome membranes prior to fusion ( Roberts et al., 1999 ). Third, activation of Rab5 stimulates the recruitment of fusion effectors to endosome membranes ( Horiuchi et al., 1997 ). Fourth, expression of an active mutant of Rab5, unable to hydrolyse GTP, leads to the formation of giant endosomes, probably through uncontrolled complete fusions between these organelles ( Stenmark et al., 1994 ). The possible involvement of some of the other Rab proteins present on phagosomes in the kiss and run process cannot be ruled out. The finding that Rab3 modulates the levels of neurotransmitter release, a biological system where 'kiss and run' type of interactions between neurotransmitter-containing vesicles and the plasma membrane have been shown to occur, suggests that rab proteins might indeed be involved in the regulation of transient fusion events ( Alvarez de Toledo et al., 1993 ; Albillos et al., 1997 ; Geppert and Sudhof, 1998). (Top panel) Intracellular trafficking of various microorganisms within their mammalian hosts. Although they originate from the plasma membrane, phagosomes containing different pathogens eventually display markers of early endosomes, late endosomes/lysosomes, or even organelles of the biosynthetic apparatus. By escaping the harsh environment of phagolysosomes, pathogens find a cosy niche within the host cell, in which they can replicate safely. Recently, mechanisms and molecules involved in the subversion of young phagosomes by their resident pathogens have been identified. Some of these mechanisms include active modulation of the phagosome compostition, or direct interference with key molecules regulating phagolysosome biogenesis. Although presented as being in the same early endosome-like compartment, pathogens like Mycobacteria, Salmonella and Leishmania reside in compartments that may differ in the relative abundance of certain markers of early and late endosomes. This indicates that there might be as many modified intracellular niches as there are pathogens infecting host cells. (Bottom panel) Biogenesis of phagolysosomes: the kiss and run hypothesis. The kiss and run model proposes that multiple fusion (kiss) and fission (run) events occur between phagosomes and endosomes during the process of phagolysosomes biogenesis. Rab GTPases such as Rab5 are thought to have a role in the regulation of this process. Molecules of the Rab family can act as molecular switches by changing their nucleotide binding state. In its GTP-bound form, Rab5 actively recruits to the membrane a series of effectors like EEA1 and the complex Rabaptin-5/Rabex-5. These Rab5 effectors assemble on the membrane in high molecular weight oligomers, which also contain NSF. EEA1 directly interacts with a member of the t-SNARE family, syntaxin 13, required for endocytic organelles fusion (see McBride et al., 1999 ). In this model, EEA1 acts as a docking protein, and together with NSF, mediates the local activation of syntaxin 13 upon membrane tethering in order to co-ordinate the assembly of a fusion pore. Then, hydrolysis of Rab5 catalysed by a cytoplasmic GAP releases the molecule from the membrane, thereby terminating the fusion event, and promoting the subsequent fission of the organelles. This would permit limited exchange (size selective) of content between phagosomes and endosomes without complete intermixing (see Desjardins et al., 1997 ), limiting the need for large-scale recycling processes. This process would further allow phagosomes to gradually acquire molecules from the endocytic pathway and transform into phagolysosomes displaying all the characteristics needed to fulfil their role as degradative organelles. Because EEA1 is only present on early endocytic and phagocytic organelles, this would confer a directionality to the fusion event. Other molecules susceptible to play the same role later in the maturation process are still to be identified. Kiss and run interactions have several advantages. (i) They allow organelles to exchange their lumenal contents without the complete mixing of their membranes, thereby minimizing the need for large-scale recycling processes and preventing the generation of aberrant gigantic organelles. (ii) They restrict the ability of pathogens to invade and colonize the whole endocytic pathway. (iii) Limited exchange of membrane molecules has the further potential of allowing the gradual transformation of organelles observed along the maturing endocytic and phagocytic pathways. Evidence for 'kiss and run' exchanges have been obtained from various biological systems including phagosome–endosome interaction ( Wang and Goren, 1987; Desjardins et al., 1994a ; 1997), endosome–endosome interaction ( Berthiaume et al., 1995 ; Roberts et al., 1999 ) and exocytosis ( Alvarez de Toledo et al., 1993 ; Albillos et al., 1997 ; Alés et al., 1999 ). In the case of exocytosis, the fusion pore formed between mast cell granules and the plasma membrane could stay open for several seconds, allowing the complete transmitter release without full fusion of the vesicle with the plasma membrane. Transient fusion events between Golgi tubules have also been proposed to occur ( Weidman, 1995). The significance of the kiss and run fusion in these biological processes remains to be firmly established. To successfully invade and replicate within their mammalian host cells, intracellular pathogens must find ways to avoid the harsh environment of phagolysosomes. They do so by finding safe haven in various intracellular niches (see Sinai and Joiner, 1997). Several laboratories have devoted efforts at characterizing the compartments in which different pathogens reside. Using a relatively small set of markers, these niches were shown to display characteristics of early endocytic organelles, organelles of the biosynthetic apparatus or the nucleus (see Fig. 1, upper panel). In contrast to phagolysosomes, these intracellular compartments do not have the lytic environment required for the killing and degradation of pathogens. Instead, pathogens find in these new environments the nutrients and conditions needed for their survival and replication. Beyond the mere identification of these compartments, one of the most important challenges is to understand how pathogens manage to reach them. The process of phagocytosis itself determines some of the characteristics of the first compartment in which pathogens are going to reside within host cells. This has nicely been shown by the observation that the biochemical nature of inert particles internalized by phagocytosis influence their trafficking along the phagolysosome pathway ( Oh and Swanson, 1996; de Chastellier and Thilo, 1997). Several receptors are involved in phagocytosis leading to widely different mechanisms of internalization such as coiling phagocytosis, zipper phagocytosis or trigger phagocytosis ( Swanson and Baer, 1995; Rittig et al., 1998 ). Caron and Hall (1998) have shown recently that Fc γ-induced phagocytosis, which results in a respiratory burst in macrophages, is mediated by Cdc42 and Rac, two small GTPases involved in actin organization. In contrast, complement-induced phagocytosis, mediated by the small GTPase Rho does not provoke a burst. The receptors or mechanisms of entry used during phagocytosis undoubtedly have major consequences on the biochemical nature of the nascent phagosomes ( Small et al., 1994 ). Perhaps the two extreme examples are Toxoplasma gondii, which invade host cells by active penetration, and inert particles, which enter cells by a receptor-mediated process (although the receptors involved have not been identified so far). While inert particles have been shown to be internalized in early compartments displaying a biochemical composition similar to that of the plasma membrane ( Lang et al., 1988 ), T. gondii appears to induce the formation of a vacuole that excludes most of the host membrane proteins ( de Carvahlo and de Souza, 1989; Mordue and Sibley, 1997). Between what seems to be these two extremes are several unrelated pathogens, including Mycobacteria, Salmonella, Leishmania, and Brucella, which appear to transit for a certain time in compartments related to the early stages of the endocytic pathway. However, unlike inert particles, these pathogens have found ways to divert the young phagosome from its usual trafficking towards phagolysosomes. Increasing evidence indicates that they do so by actively modulating the composition of their phagosomes or by interfering with some of the key molecules involved in phagolysosome biogenesis. However, the more we learn about the compartments in which pathogens reside, the more obvious it seems that there will be no unifying model describing the mechanisms underlying the trafficking of microorganisms within their hosts. Using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches, it was demonstrated that the promastigote form of Leishmania uses its lipophosphoglycan (LPG), a glycolipid that covers the whole surface of the parasite, to inhibit phagosome–endosome fusion at the onset of infection ( Desjardins and Descoteaux, 1997; Dermine et al., 2000 ) (see Fig. 2). Indeed, LPG has been shown to be an important virulence factor involved in a wide variety of functions allowing parasite survival in their hosts ( Turco and Descoteaux, 1992; Beverley and Turco, 1998). The way by which Leishmania parasites use LPG to alter the properties of their host phagosomes is, however, poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that LPG could insert itself in the phagosome membrane to modify its properties mainly by preventing the formation of an inverted hexagonal structure, resulting in reduced fusogenic properties ( Miao et al., 1995 ). As a consequence, LPG would give rise to an effective 'steric repulsion' between phagosomal and endosomal membranes or reduce the negative curvature strain in bilayers, increasing the energy barrier for forming highly curved fusion intermediates, thereby preventing fusion. Analysis of the trafficking of promastigotes within macrophages indicated that these parasites are able to impair the translocation to phagosomes of the GTPase Rab7, a key molecule for phagosome fusion with late endocytic organelles ( Scianimanico et al., 1999 ). As a result, promastigotes are not directed to mature phagolysosomes. Instead, they appear to stay within an early endosome-like compartment for at least a few hours, which contrasts with the compartment housing the transformed amastigote form of the parasite that displays typical phagolysosome characteristics ( Russell et al., 1992 ). These observations clearly indicate that Leishmania parasites need to avoid the harsh environment of phagolysosomes for a certain period of time only. Survival strategy of Leishmania donovani within macrophages. L. donovani infects macrophages in its promastigote form, which displays a flagellum and the lipophosphoglycan (LPG) on its surface. Early after infection, the L. donovani-containing phagosomes intersect the early endocytic pathway but do not fuse with late endosomes or lysosomes. This partial inhibition of fusion is mediated by the presence of LPG on the parasite surface and its possible insertion into the phagosome membrane. Leishmania promastigotes take advantage of the hospitable environment of 'early' phagosomes to initiate their transformation into amastigotes. During this process, the parasite synthezises 'survival proteins' needed for the subsequent amastigote survival within phagolysosomes. The promastigote to amastigote transformation is also accompanied by the downregulation and disappearance of LPG, which lift the phagosome-late endosome–lysosome fusion inhibition and allow phagolysosome biogenesis to take place. At this point, amastigotes are fully competent to survive and proliferate within phagolysosomes. Inside phagosomes, promastigotes are exposed to conditions that differ greatly from those previously encountered in the sandfly, the other vector of Leishmania. The elevated temperature and decreased phagosomal pH encountered in the mammalian host trigger the differentiation of promastigotes into non-motile amastigotes ( Zilberstein and Shapira, 1994). This transformation is accompanied by the expression of virulence determinants, which undoubtedly play key roles in the subsequent survival of Leishmania within phagolysosomes ( Antoine et al., 1998 ). The promastigote to amastigote transformation is also accompanied by the downregulation of LPG, explaining why amastigotes are observed in phagolysosomes. Indeed, disappearance of LPG from the surface of transforming Leishmania probably leads to the lift of the fusion inhibition with endocytic organelles allowing phagosome maturation to resume. At that point, amastigotes have synthesized all the molecules required to sustain the harsh environment of phagolysosomes. Identification of these 'survival' proteins are likely to offer new targets for the development of therapeutic strategies to fight leishmaniases (see model in Scianimanico et al., 1999 ). The elegant work of the group of Gorvel in Marseille allowed us to demonstrate that the intracellular trafficking of Brucella in HeLa cells leads this pathogen to compartments displaying autophagosome/endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-like characteristics. Early after infection, Brucella-containing phagosomes fuse with early endosomes and reside in compartments displaying EEA1, an early endosomal marker ( Pizarro-Cerdáet al., 1998a ; 1999). These phagosomes do not display the late endosomal markers Rab7 or the mannose-6-phosphate receptors and do not seem to fuse with lysosomes ( Pizarro-Cerdáet al., 1998b ). However, they gradually accumulate LAMP1 and LAMP2 suggesting that Brucella can induce the fusion of early phagosomes with organelles of the biosynthetic pathway, which may be carrying newly synthesized LAMP molecules. At approximately 1 h post inoculation, bacteria are located within a compartment positive for LAMP and the (ER) markers sec61beta and the protein disulphide isomerase. The mechanisms and molecules allowing Brucella to induce the fusion of phagosomes with ER elements have not been identified. The presence of the autophagosomal marker monodansylcadaverin on Brucella-containing phagosomes suggests, however, that mechanisms related to autophagy might be involved ( Pizarro-Cerdáet al., 1998a, b). Recent findings indicate that Brucella abortus mutants for bvr-R and bvr-S, members of a new two-components regulatory system, are not directed to ER-like compartments but are rather present within phagosomes unable to inhibit fusion with lysosomes ( Sola-Landa et al., 1998 ). The way bvr-R and bvr-S products modulate phagosome properties is not known. However, the presence of type IV secretion systems in Brucella suggests that translocation of effector molecules to the host cytoplasm might be involved in Brucella intracellular trafficking ( Foulongne et al. 2000 ). Further studies should allow us to identify what are the molecules enabling the fusion of early phagosomes with ER elements or, alternatively, the recruitment of ER molecules to phagosomes. Legionella pneumophilia enters its host cells through a specialized form of phagocytosis referred to as coiling phagocytosis ( Horwitz, 1984). This pathogen resides in phagosomes that fail to acidify and fuse with lysosomes ( Horwitz, 1983a; Horwitz and Maxfield, 1984). Rapidly after entry, phagosomes associate with smooth vesicles, mitochondria and ER, and appear as vacuoles covered with ribosomes ( Horwitz, 1983b; Swanson and Isberg, 1995). These replicative phagosomes display similarities with autophagic vacuoles ( Swanson and Isberg, 1995). They do not display any of the usual markers of the endocytic apparatus indicating that maturation of these vacuoles towards phagolysosomes is inhibited early after phagocytosis. Recently, a family of genes involved in bacterial virulence have been identified (see Kirby and Isberg, 1998; Segal and Shuman, 1998). One of these, the dotA gene was shown to encode an inner membrane protein required for phagosome–lysosome fusion inhibition ( Roy and Isberg, 1997; Roy et al., 1998 ). Because icm/dot complexes are capable of forming pores into eukaryotic membranes, they may function by secreting macromolecules into the cell cytoplasm preventing phagosome–lysosome fusion ( Kirby et al., 1998 ; Vogel et al., 1998 ). The target of these proteins on phagosomes is not known. Although Legionella and Brucella appear to reside within compartments displaying ER or autophagosome features, the biogenesis of these phagosomes is clearly not identical. In contrast to the Brucella phagosome, which follows the phagocytic pathway for a certain period of time, the absence of endocytic/phagocytic markers on Legionella-containing phagosomes suggests that diversion from the phagocytic pathway occurs rapidly after internalization for this pathogen. The benefit gained by Brucella during its transit through the phagocytic apparatus is not fully understood. Chlamydia resides in intracellular compartments referred to as inclusions.

Although it is not known whether the granule-mediated and Fas-mediated cytolytic mechanisms share common components, proteinase activity has been implicated as an important feature of both pathways. The orthopoxviruses cowpox virus and rabbitpox virus each encode three members of the serpin family of proteinase inhibitors, designated SPI-1, SPI-2, and SPI-3. Of these, SPI-2 (also referred to as cytokine response modifier A in cowpox virus) has been shown to inhibit the proteolytic activity of both members of the interleukin 1 beta converting enzyme family and granzyme B. We report here that cells infected with cowpox or rabbitpox viruses exhibit resistance to cytolysis by either cytolytic mechanism. Whereas mutation of the cytokine response modifier A/SPI-2 gene was necessary to relieve inhibition of Fasmediated cytolysis, in some cell types mutation of SPI-1, in addition to cytokine response modifier A/SPI-2, was necessary to completely abrogate inhibition. In contrast, viral inhibition of granule-mediated killing was unaffected by mutation of cytokine response modifier A/SPI-2 alone, and it was relieved only when both the cytokine response modifier A/SPI-2 and SPI-1 genes were inactivated. These results suggest that an interleukin 1 beta converting enzyme-like enzymatic activity is involved in both killing mechanisms and indicate that two viral proteins, SPI-1 and cytokine response modifier A/SPI-2, are necessary to inhibit both cytolysis pathways.",W1973305783,False,0.002401150995865464

With the exception of perforin−/−, all in vitro– and ex vivo–derived Tc and NK cell populations from the mutant strains induced 51Cr-release in target cells at levels and with kinetics similar to those of normal mice. This contrasts with their capacity to induce apoptotic nuclear damage in target cells. In gzmA×B−/− mice, Tc/NK-mediated target cell DNA fragmentation was not observed, even after extended incubation periods (10 h), but was normal in gzmA-deficient and only impaired in gzmB-deficient mice in short-term (2–4 h), but not long-term (4–10 h), nucleolytic assays.

In contrast, treatment with the anti-L3T4 antibody had essentially no effect on either virus elimination or CTL response but abolished antibody production.

We hypothesized that pathogen recognition by iDC is mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and asked which TLRs are expressed during the progression of monocytes to mDC. We first measured mRNA levels for TLRs 1–5 and MD2 (a protein required for TLR4 function) by Northern analysis. For most TLRs, message expression decreased severalfold as monocytes differentiated into iDC, but opposing this trend, TLR3 and MD2 showed marked increases during iDC formation. When iDC were induced to mature with LPS or TNF-α, expression of most TLRs transiently increased and then nearly disappeared. Stimulation of iDC, but not mDC, with LPS resulted in the activation of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase, an early component in the TLR signaling pathway, strongly suggesting that LPS signals through a TLR. Surface expression of TLRs 1 and 4, as measured by mAb binding, was very low, corresponding to a few thousand molecules per cell in monocytes, and a few hundred or less in iDC. We conclude that TLRs are expressed in iDC and are involved in responses to at least one pathogen-derived substance, LPS.

However, mice infected with VSV are incapable of responding to signals from suppressor T cells or their soluble factors. Further analysis revealed that VSV infection does not interfere with the induction of Ts-1 or Ts-2 cells. Because infection of Ts-1 or Ts-2 donors had no effect on the subsequent response seen in the recipients of antigen and suppressor T cells, the most likely candidate for the target of VSV infection is therefore the Ts-3 cell or another T cell interacting with Ts-3. This is supported by our observation that it is possible to bypass the VSV effect by providing the recipients of VSV with normal Lyt-2+-bearing T cells.",W1634148461,False,0.009568639099597931
https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.152.2.478,Mechanism of virus-induced Ig subclass shifts.,"Infection of mice with live viruses leads to a dramatic increase in the amount of IgG2a Ig with a consequent shift in the ratio of IgG1/IgG2a. To examine the Ig subclass shift induced by viral infection, we challenged mice with live virus, inactivated virus, or replication-defective mutant viruses that were able to infect cells and produce some viral proteins but were not able to complete a replicative cycle. While killed (or inactivated) virus was capable of inducing HSV-specific antibody, it did not stimulate a shift in the subclass of the total Ig. Replication-defective mutant viruses that fail to express a functional ICP8 or ICP27 protein, but not a mutant expressing a defective ICP4 protein, were able to stimulate the shift. Thus, only a portion of the lytic cycle is sufficient to induce the shift. At least part of the effect is mediated by IFN-gamma.",W1800664456,False,0.00027356305508874357

If animals are homozygous for the Itys susceptibility allele, the Gram-negative bacterium undergoes rapid net multiplication, and mice die of a typhoid fever-like disease by day 10 of infection. Animals that are homozygous or heterozygous for the resistance allele, Ityr, control net bacterial replication and survive the first phase of salmonellosis. Indirect studies have implicated the resident macrophage as the effector cell for regulation of early in vivo salmonellae growth. To verify this supposition and to evaluate the phenotypic expression of Ity, we developed an in vitro assay to compare kinetics of S. typhimurium growth within Ityr and Itys macrophages. Resident peritoneal and splenic macrophages were used from inbred Ityr and Itys mice and from Ity congeneic mice. With these mice and through the use of radiolabeled S. typhimurium and an avirulent temperature-sensitive mutant of the bacterium, we found that: phagocytosis of S. typhimurium by Ityr and by Itys macrophages was the same; S. typhimurium grew to a greater extent in Itys peritoneal and splenic macrophages than in Ityr cells; Ityr macrophages killed intracellular salmonellae more efficiently than did Itys macrophages. Thus, we have demonstrated directly that Ity is expressed by the macrophage and have shown for the first time with Ity congeneic mice that the basis for differential net growth of virulent S. typhimurium in Ityr and Itys macrophages is a variation in the degree of bacterial kill.",W1532953601,False,0.062248047441244125
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0136580,Crop Species Diversity Changes in the United States: 1978–2012,"Anecdotal accounts regarding reduced US cropping system diversity have raised concerns about negative impacts of increasingly homogeneous cropping systems. However, formal analyses to document such changes are lacking. Using US Agriculture Census data, which are collected every five years, we quantified crop species diversity from 1978 to 2012, for the contiguous US on a county level basis. We used Shannon diversity indices expressed as effective number of crop species (ENCS) to quantify crop diversity. We then evaluated changes in county-level crop diversity both nationally and for each of the eight Farm Resource Regions developed by the National Agriculture Statistics Service. During the 34 years we considered in our analyses, both national and regional ENCS changed. Nationally, crop diversity was lower in 2012 than in 1978. However, our analyses also revealed interesting trends between and within different Resource Regions. Overall, the Heartland Resource Region had the lowest crop diversity whereas the Fruitful Rim and Northern Crescent had the highest. In contrast to the other Resource Regions, the Mississippi Portal had significantly higher crop diversity in 2012 than in 1978. Also, within regions there were differences between counties in crop diversity. Spatial autocorrelation revealed clustering of low and high ENCS and this trend became stronger over time. These results show that, nationally counties have been clustering into areas of either low diversity or high diversity. Moreover, a significant trend of more counties shifting to lower rather than to higher crop diversity was detected. The clustering and shifting demonstrates a trend toward crop diversity loss and attendant homogenization of agricultural production systems, which could have far-reaching consequences for provision of ecosystem system services associated with agricultural systems as well as food system sustainability.",W1189940019,False,0.8717285990715027

This study was conducted to quantify potential soil C sequestration rates for different crops in response to decreasing tillage intensity or enhancing rotation complexity, and to estimate the duration of time over which sequestration may occur. Analyses of C sequestration rates were completed using a global database of 67 long‐term agricultural experiments, consisting of 276 paired treatments. Results indicate, on average, that a change from conventional tillage (CT) to no‐till (NT) can sequester 57 ± 14 g C m −2 yr −1, excluding wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.)‐fallow systems which may not result in SOC accumulation with a change from CT to NT. Enhancing rotation complexity can sequester an average 20 ± 12 g C m −2 yr −1, excluding a change from continuous corn ( Zea mays L.) to corn‐soybean ( Glycine max L.) which may not result in a significant accumulation of SOC. Carbon sequestration rates, with a change from CT to NT, can be expected to peak in 5 to 10 yr with SOC reaching a new equilibrium in 15 to 20 yr. Following initiation of an enhancement in rotation complexity, SOC may reach a new equilibrium in approximately 40 to 60 yr. Carbon sequestration rates, estimated for a number of individual crops and crop rotations in this study, can be used in spatial modeling analyses to more accurately predict regional, national, and global C sequestration potentials.",W136628441,False,0.11029276996850967

Emergent multiple predator effects ( MPE s) include risk enhancement, where combined predators kill more prey than predicted by their individual effects, and risk reduction, where fewer prey are killed than predicted. Current methods for detecting MPE s are biased because they assume linear functional responses and/or no prey depletion. As a result, past studies overestimated the occurrence of risk enhancement for additive designs, and tended to overestimate the occurrence of risk reduction for substitutive designs. Characterising the predators' functional responses and accounting for prey depletion reduces biases in detection, estimation, interpretation and generalisation of the emergent effects of predator diversity on prey survival. These findings have implications beyond MPE 's and should be considered in all studies aimed at understanding how multiple factors combine when demographic rates are density dependent.",W1975780244,False,0.708075761795044

https://doi.org/10.2307/1942196,Pattern and Process in Grassland Bird Communities,"Variations in abundance and distribution of bird species and avifaunal and community organization at regional, local, and within—plot levels were studied during 1969 and 1970 at a shortgrass prairie in Colorado and during 1970 at six additional International Biological Program (IBP) grassland sites. Patterns were generally not distinct at the regional level, although low rainfall sites tended to support fewer individuals and less biomass than more mesic sites. The dominant bird species were widely distributed, but 70% of all species recorded were present at only one of the seven sites. Local plot—to—plot differences, associated with grazing intensity, were considerably more important than the regional differences. Vegetational and avifaunal relationships of plots were determined by similarity—cluster analysis and by examination of vegetation structure. Variations in the number of breeding bird species, bird—species diversity, or equitability, were unrelated to the gradient of plots from tallgrass through shortgrass to desert, but standing crop biomass generally decreased along this gradient. The plots differed in the proportions of small, medium, and large—sized species. Shortgrass sites were generally dominated by omnivorous species; plots with a greater vegetation structure supported more carnivorous forms. Only carnivorous species occurred at the desert site. The effect of grazing on bird populations varied among the treatment plots at the various sites. In the Colorado shortgrass prairie, grazing season had a greater effect on community organization than grazing intensity. Patterns of variation were much more pronounced when single species rather than breeding faunas were considered. Grasshoppers, Lepidoptera larvae, beetles (especially curculionids, carabids, cerambycids, and scarabaeids), ants, and various seeds were the most important prey of the dominant bird species. Small sparrows and larks had generally similar diets. The diets of the larger meadowlarks and shorebirds differed from those of the former group and also differed from each other. The proportion of seeds and arthropods in the diets of Lark Buntings and Horned Larks varied considerably with time. Diurnal raptors, studied at only one site, were widely dispersed, occurring at densities and standing crops substantially less than those of small passerine populations. Owls preyed chiefly upon small mammals and insects, but the proportions of these food items in the diet differed significantly among the four species studied. The estimated energy intake of the breeding bird populations from April through August ranged from 1.01 to 2.33 kcal/m 2 ; thus the energy flux through avian consumers in grasslands is apparently very small. In general, seeds decreased in importance as energy sources and arthropods increased in importance along a gradient from shortgrass through mixed grass to tallgrass plots. Secondary production estimated for six grazing—treatment plots ranged from 3.9 to 6.9 x 10 — 3 g/m 2. The role of birds as consumers in the dynamics of grassland ecosystems is considered. It is suggested that birds may act as controllers of other elements of system function or may not be closely evolved into the functional framework of the ecosystem at all, existing on ""excesses"" in production.",W1969774237,False,0.8242996335029602

Adult and juvenile newts were censused using a combination of methods, including drift fences and dip—netting. A technique of individual recognition was developed utilizing the number and pattern of dorsal red spots. Assisted by a simple system of toeclips, designating pond and year of first capture, these methods provided records of age, survival, and movements of &gt;8,500 individuals. The results revealed 2 migratory peaks of adults each year: a breeding migration to ponds in March, and an August—September emigration to terrestrial hibernacula. Breeding population size, ranging from 6 to &gt;2,600 adults per pond was stationary during the study but was significantly correlated with pond age. Annual turnover of breeding populations to new adults exceeded 50%. Sex ratios were consistently 2 ♂ ♂: 1 ♀ in the breeding populations but tended toward 1:1 in the cohorts of new recruits. Annual adult ♀ survival was density dependent and significantly less than that of♂ ♂. The average ♀ expected to breed only 1.3 times, whereas ♂ ♂ had an expectancy of 1.9 breeding seasons. Faithfully homing to the same pond year after year, adults never migrated to new ponds between breeding seasons. Juvenile production at most ponds was poor over the 3 yr. Only 1 pond had a reproductive output consistently above a calculated replacement rate. It is inferred from the combination of poor reproduction and high immigration rates that breeding adults were not replaced by their own progeny but rather by foreign—born individuals. The red—spotted newt is basically a colonizing species responding to pond habitats that rapidly shift in time and space. It is suggested that beaver ponds have the necessary attributes of small size and temporal instability to which the life—history patterns of newts seems adapted. The majority of ponds in this area functioned as reproductive sinks in a larger, metapopulational structure. Adults in such ponds were reproductive failures or most of their lives. Only a small number of adults accounted for the regional reproduction in 1974 and 1975, but I very populous pond produced &gt;91% of the young in 1976. Because reproductive success is pond dependent, interdemal selection may play an important role in newt evolution. It is hypothesized that homing behavior evolved as a consequence of natural selection within metapopulation centers and that the eft stage is the mechanism of dispersibility to new ponds. A new model of metapopulational dynamics is presented.",W1966594668,False,0.881483256816864

Here, we investigated one possible function, that of protection of plants from photodamage at high temperatures. Fluorescence, reflectance, monoterpene concentrations and visual leaf damage were measured in Quercus ilex seedlings exposed to temperature increases from 25 to 50°C (in 5°C steps) under photorespiratory (21% O 2 ) or nonphotorespiratory (2% O 2 ) atmospheres, and under control or terpene fumigation conditions. Lower variable to maximum fluorescence ratio (Fv : Fm: potential photochemical efficiency of photosystem II, PSII) and electron transport rate (ETR) were found in nonphotorespiratory conditions at temperatures greater than 35°C. Monoterpene concentrations were also lower, and leaf damage greater, in the low O 2 atmospheres. Monoterpene fumigation, which increased the foliar terpene concentrations by two‐ to four‐fold, increased the photochemical efficiency between 35°C and 50°C, and decreased leaf damage, only under the nonphotorespiratory conditions. These results provide evidence that: photorespiration decreases photodamage, especially at high temperatures; photorespiration increases monoterpene production; plants are able to acquire exogenous monoterpenes and the acquisition response to temperature follows the stomatal conductance response; and monoterpenes can replace photorespiration in protection from photodamage at high temperatures, possibly by scavenging oxygen‐reactive species, but they do not provide additional thermotolerance.",W1973866751,False,0.6436456441879272

To understand if exogenous monoterpene fumigation results in internal accumulation of monoterpenes, a physical method of monoterpene extraction was used. The internal content of monoterpenes increased in concert with increasing fumigation doses. This unambiguously demonstrated acquisition of exogenous monoterpenes. We exposed fumigated Q. suber leaves to two cycles of increasing temperatures from 35 to 55°C at 5°C steps. When leaves were exposed to a low dose of exogenous monoterpenes, yielding an internal content similar to that endogenously formed in the leaves of the monoterpene‐emitter Q. ilex, no clear improvement in thermotolerance was found. When leaves were exposed to a high dose of exogenous monoterpenes, yielding an internal content of about five fold the endogenous pool of Q. ilex, but comparable with the expected content following stress‐induced stomatal closure, photosynthesis inhibition at high temperatures was attenuated. This effect was observed only at temperatures &lt;45°C during the first cycle, but at all temperatures between 35 and 55°C when plants were exposed to two cycles of high temperatures. Monoterpenes were still found in the leaves of Q. suber 12 h after ending the fumigation. Monoterpenes were also found in non‐fumigated leaves distant up to 45 cm from the fumigated leaves. If monoterpenes make the photosynthetic apparatus more resistant to high temperatures, the effect might not be limited to the fumigated leaves and might be persistent after fumigation.",W1522088097,False,0.7879144549369812

The largest single category of nonacyl lipids in higher plants is undoubtedly the terpenoids, an extremely abundant class of natural products with a common biosynthetic origin. Terpenoids all share a common construction pattern: the linkage of five- carbon units having the branched carbon skeleton of isopentane. Terpenoids are found in all living organisms, but achieve their greatest structural and functional diversity in the plant kingdom. This chapter considers each of the three stages of terpenoid biosynthesis, such as, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes. It describes the sequence of biosynthetic transformations of each stage and reviews what is known about the enzymology, mechanism, and regulation of various key steps of the pathway. The chapter examines the roles of subcellular compartmentation, multienzyme complexes, assimilate partitioning, and morphological differentiation in the overall control of plant terpenoid biogenesis.",W1569816048,False,0.11267248541116714

Fumigation with monoterpenes reduced the decline of photosynthesis, photorespiration and monoterpene emission found in non-fumigated leaves exposed to high temperatures. It also substantially increased respiration when photosynthesis and photorespiration were inhibited by low O2 and CO2-free air. These results indicate that, as previously reported for isoprene, monoterpenes may help plants cope with heat stress. Monoterpenes may enhance membrane stability, thus providing a rather non-specific protection of photosynthetic and respiratory processes. Monoterpene emission was maximal at a temperature of 35 °C and was inhibited at higher temperatures. This is likely to be the result of the temperature dependency of the enzymes involved in monoterpene synthesis. In contrast to other monoterpenes, cis- and trans-β-ocimene did not respond to exposure to high temperatures. Cis-β-ocimene also did not respond to low O2 or to fumigation. These results indicate that cis and trans-β-ocimene may have a different pathway of formation that probably does not involve enzymatic synthesis.",W1970752206,False,0.7061789035797119

We exploited this unique feature to investigate terpene biosynthesis in intact leaves of Q. ilex. Light induction allowed us to distinguish three classes of terpenes: (i) a rapidly induced class including alpha-pinene; (ii) a more slowly induced class, including cis-beta-ocimene; and (iii) the most slowly induced class, including 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol. Using 13C, we found that alpha-pinene and cis-beta-ocimene were labeled quickly and almost completely while there was a delay before label appeared in linalool and 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol. The acetyl group of 3-methyl-3-buten-1-yl acetate was labeled quickly but label was limited to 20% of the moiety. It is suggested that the ocimene class of monoterpenes is made from one or more terpenes of the alpha-pinene class and that both classes are made entirely from reduced carbon pools inside the chloroplasts. Linalool and 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol are made from a different pool of reduced carbon, possibly in nonphotosynthetic plastids. The acetyl group of the 3-methyl-3-buten-1-yl acetate is derived mostly from carbon that does not participate in photosynthetic reactions. Low humidity and prolonged exposure to light favored ocimenes emission and induced linalool emission. This may indicate conversion between terpene classes.",W1988734079,False,0.8518540263175964

The δ13C values of carbonate nodules from paleosols in the deltaic lower Bloomsburg Formation (Upper Silurian) reflect the contribution of carbon from marine groundwater or fossils, coupled with low biological activity. The δ13C values of carbonate rhizocretions from stratigraphically high paleosols in the Bloomsburg Formation, and in the alluvial Catskill (Upper Devonian) and Mauch Chunk (Upper Mississippian) Formations, suggest an extensive C3 flora and significant contribution of atmospheric CO2. Paleozoic atmospheric CO2 levels inferred from δ13C of pedogenic carbonate are significantly higher than present levels. This content is PDF only. Please click on the PDF icon to access.

The age of the earliest maize, and its rate of dispersal are thus important components of cultural development in the New World. We have secured permission from the Federal Government of Mexico to date critical specimens from Tehuacán, which represent what are probably some of the earliest known stages of maize evolution. Twelve Zea mays samples have been dated, six from Cueva San Marcos and six from Cueva Coxcatlán. These were selected as having the best stratigraphic control and correlation with previously dated charcoal samples, and to represent the most ancient maize. Corn from Cueva San Marcos is oldest: four of the six specimens from this cave were within statistics of 4700 BP (uncalibrated). The oldest known domesticated corn is thus no older than 3600 cal BC (dendro-calibrated in calendric years).",W1115673668,False,0.7497485280036926

https://doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511598401.016,Factions and political development in the central Andes,"Investigators of prehistory generally concur that political competition has often been critical to the development of social complexity. Among the key forms of political contention are hierarchical, peer, polity, expansionist, and factional competition. These are politically joined processes whose significance varies (1) as the complexity and reach of the sociopolitical unit is transformed, (2) as the interaction emphasizes internally or externally directed conflict, and (3) as the competition is structured vertically (e.g., between classes) or horizontally (e.g., between polities). This paper focuses attention on factionalism in the Upper Mantaro Valley, Peru, during the late pre-Inka, Inka, and early colonial periods. These successive periods provide an excellent opportunity for examining how political activity was transformed as the context of interaction shifted rapidly from autonomous, to imperial, to colonial rule (Fig. 15.1).",W1517730215,False,0.000135077178128995

This review covers recently published research on the global species composition and dynamics of marine biofilms, consisting mainly of bacteria and diatoms found on man‐made surfaces including AF coatings. Marine biofilms directly interact with larger organisms (macrofoulers) during colonization processes; hence, recent literature on understanding the basis of the biofilm/macrofouling interactions is essential and will also be reviewed here. Overall, differences have been identified in species composition between biofilm and planktonic forms for both diatoms and bacteria at various exposure sites. In most studies, the underlying biofilm was found to induce larval and spore settlement of macrofoulers; however, issues such as reproducibility, differences in exposure sites and biofilm composition (natural multispecies vs. monospecific species) may influence the outcomes.",W1603417727,False,0.8586153388023376

Three main sampling strategies were identified: selective, volume-reduced, and bulk sampling. Most sediment samples came from sandy beaches at the high tide line, and most seawater samples were taken at the sea surface using neuston nets. Four steps were distinguished during sample processing: density separation, filtration, sieving, and visual sorting of microplastics. Visual sorting was one of the most commonly used methods for the identification of microplastics (using type, shape, degradation stage, and color as criteria). Chemical and physical characteristics (e.g., specific density) were also used. The most reliable method to identify the chemical composition of microplastics is by infrared spectroscopy. Most studies reported that plastic fragments were polyethylene and polypropylene polymers. Units commonly used for abundance estimates are ""items per m(2)"" for sediment and sea surface studies and ""items per m(3)"" for water column studies. Mesh size of sieves and filters used during sampling or sample processing influence abundance estimates. Most studies reported two main size ranges of microplastics: (i) 500 μm-5 mm, which are retained by a 500 μm sieve/net, and (ii) 1-500 μm, or fractions thereof that are retained on filters. We recommend that future programs of monitoring continue to distinguish these size fractions, but we suggest standardized sampling procedures which allow the spatiotemporal comparison of microplastic abundance across marine environments.",W2005404508,False,0.17034876346588135

Bacteriol. 89: 1594–1609. 1965.— Nitrosocystis oceanus has distinctive features: the cell wall (overall thickness, 250 A) has an inner triplet structure and a dense enveloping layer; between these lie the “cell-wall organelles” (two or more per cell; plaques about 0.5 μ in diameter and 0.1 μ thick) of unknown function and genesis. The plasma membrane (ca. 80 A) shows rare intrusions that form irregular peripheral vesicles, which appear to form the component lamellae of the “membranous organelle” and probably detach from the periphery. The membranous organelles consist of about 20 vesicles so flattened that the lumen is only 100 A thick. The outer surfaces are in contact and form a triplet structure with an accentuated center line; these lamellae almost traverse the cell, displace the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasms, and form the prominent, seemingly permanent, feature of the cell. Division is constrictive without trace of a septum, and the act of division divides the membranous organelle. No mesosomes appear to be formed. Nitrosomonas europaea shows no sign of a cell-wall organelle or of the outer enveloping layer of wall. The cytoplasm contains intrusive paired lamellae, which might or might not remain connected to the periphery, and they do not fuse or form regular associations. These are thought to be the equivalent of the vesicles in Nitrosocystis but remaining almost parallel and close to the plasma membrane. Nitrobacter agilis has a unique plasma membrane with a (50 A) dense layer applied to the inside of the usual unit membrane. All of the components are represented in the intrusions, which are arranged over and shape the poles of the cells, with close and regular spacing.

,An optimality approach to male and female body sizes in an extremely size-dimorphic cichlid fish,"Question: Can intrasexual selection on male size and natural selection on female size in the shell-brooding cichlid Lamprologus callipterus explain the greatest male/female sexual size dimorphism (SSD) reported to date among animals? Mathematical methods: (1) Mortality model to predict male and female body sizes. (2) Gain rate maximization and (3) combined mortality/gain rate maximization model to predict female size. We compared observed body sizes in the field with predictions from these models. Key assumptions: (1) Body size at sexual maturity is determined by a trade-off between survival to sexual maturity and (a) number of mates in males and (b) fecundity in females. (2) and (3) Female body size is constrained by increasing search costs, because shells large enough for breeding become limited as females become larger. Results: (1) Male body size predicted by the mortality model matches size as found in the field closely, but the model strongly overestimated female size. (2) The female body size predicted by the gain rate maximization model fitted well within the range of sizes observed in the field. (3) Including the effect of mortality into this model hardly changes the prediction. Conclusions: (1) Intersexual selection can explain male body size, but fecundity selection alone cannot explain female size. (2) and (3) The breeding substrate strongly constrains female size. The extreme male-biased SSD is due to strong selection on the body sizes of both sexes in opposite directions.",W1503019390,False,0.8450489640235901

Its simplicity makes it an attractive model to explain the evolution of reciprocal altruism in animals that lack the information or cognitive skills needed for other types of reciprocity. Yet, generalized reciprocity is anonymous and thus defenseless against exploitation by defectors. Recognizing that animals hardly ever interact randomly, we investigate whether social network structure can mitigate this vulnerability. Our results show that heterogeneous interaction patterns strongly support the evolution of generalized reciprocity. The future probability of being rewarded for an altruistic act is inversely proportional to the average connectivity of the social network when cooperators are rare. Accordingly, sparse networks are conducive to the invasion of reciprocal altruism. Moreover, the evolutionary stability of cooperation is enhanced by a modular network structure. Communities of reciprocal altruists are protected against exploitation, because modularity increases the mean access time, that is, the average number of steps that it takes for a random walk on the network to reach a defector. Sparseness and community structure are characteristic properties of vertebrate social interaction patterns, as illustrated by network data from natural populations ranging from fish to primates.",W1603327148,False,0.5433000326156616

How long does it take to reach its stationary distribution? in fact, this occurs surprisingly rapidly. Previous analysis has shown that the total variation distance to stationarity is large if the number of steps N is &lt; 1/4 n log n and close to 0 if N &gt; 1/4 n log n. This paper derives an explicit expression for the variation distance as n → ∞ in the transition region N ˜ 1/4 n log n. This permits the first careful evaluation of a cutoff phenomenon observed in a wide variety of Markov chains. the argument involves Fourier analysis to express the probability as a contour integral and saddle point approximation. the asymptotic results are in good agreement with numerical results for n as small as 100.",W2027808858,False,0.004252084065228701
https://doi.org/10.1090/s0894-0347-1991-1077279-1,Quasi-random set systems,"There are many properties of mathematical objects that satisfy what is sometimes called a 0-1 law, in the following sense. Under some natural probability measure on the set of objects, the measure of the subset of objects having the given property is either 0 or 1. In the latter case we can say that almost all the objects have the property. Familiar examples of this phenomenon are the following: almost all real numbers are transcendental (or normal to every base), almost all integers are composite, almost all continuous real functions are nondifferentiable, etc. It is often the case that the objects under consideration can be partitioned into a countable number of finite classes Cn, with the probability assigned to an object in Cn being just 1/ICn I. In this case, we say that a property Pn satisfies a 0-1 law if the fraction of the number of objects in Cn that satisfy Pn either tends to 0 or tends to 1 as n -x 0o. For example, almost all graphs on n vertices have maximum cliques and maximum independent sets of size at most 2 log n, almost all Boolean functions with n variables have circuit complexity (1 + o( 1 ))2n and almost all binary codes of length n with at most 2nR codewords (with R less than the binary symmetric channel capacity C) have arbitrarily small error probability (a special case of Shannon's coding theorem; see [S48]). One of the first general results of this type was the theorem of Fagin [F76] and Glebskii et al. [GKLT69], which asserts that every property of graphs that can be expressed in first-order logic satisfies a 0-1 law (see [SS88] for recent striking developments in this topic). One obvious method for finding explicit objects having some property Pn shared by almost all objects in Cn is simply to select one at random. With overwhelming probability (tending to 1 as n -x oc), the selected object will have property Pn. Unfortunately, it may be (and often is) extremely difficult to prove that any particular object does indeed satisfy Pn. It is our purpose in this paper to describe a method that can to a certain extent circumvent this difficulty. We will show that, for a variety of families, it is possible to identify a natural hierarchy of equivalence classes of properties, all of which are shared by almost all objects in the family.

We identify three basic questions that such data can be used to answer: does the sex ratio differ from some theoretically expected mean value, does it differ from an expected distribution and is variation in sex ratio associated with some measured explanatory terms? Our main focus is on the latter question. We discuss analytical methods in order of 'sophistication', starting with nonparametric methods (which make few assumptions about underlying statistical distributions), then classical parametric methods (which assume that data conform to a normal distribution of deviations from a statistical model) and finally generalized linear models (GLMs). GLMs are semi-parametric methods that encompass models assuming a normal distribution but may also assume other distributions. This is an important advantage as sex ratio data are best expressed as proportions (sex ratio = males/(males + females)) and deviations are expected to conform to a binomial distribution. GLMs assuming binomial distributions are often termed logistic regression models. Distributions may not conform to the normal or binomial assumptions of classical parametric analyses or logistic GLMs, and we discuss how these problems can be overcome. The statistical approaches we discuss are illustrated with worked examples and case histories from recent sex ratio literature.

Scolytinae: Cryphalini and Corthylini.,"New biological and/or geographical distribution data are given for 93 species of Scolytidae in the following genera, principally from Mexico: Stegomerus, Scolytogenes, Hypocryphalus, Trypophloeus, Hypothenemus, Cryptocarenus, Dendroterus, Araptus, Pseudopityophthorus, Conophthorus, Pityophthorus, Gnathotrichus, Tricolus, Amphicranus, Monarthrum, Microcorthylus, Corthylocurus, and Corthylus. The genus Trypophloeus is reported from Mexico for the first time. For the past five years we have been extensively collecting bark and ambrosia beetles from a wide variety of habitats, mostly in central Mexico. Most of this effort has been directed towards faunistic and ecological studies in selected areas which are being treated separately (Equihua and Atkinson 1985; Atkinson and Equihua 1985a). None the less we have made many collections in other areas and a large number of records have been obtained which are of interest due to range extensions, -new host associations, or new observations on the biology and ecology of these species. These are being published now to permit their inclusion in a projected catalog of the Mexican Scolytidae. Due to the large number of records involved, those for the subfamily Hylesininae and the Scolytinae (excluding the Cryphalini and Corthylini) have been treated elsewhere (Atkinson and Equihua 1985b). New host plants and new state or country distribution records are indicated. New host plants of extremely polyphagous species of the Cryphalini (Hypothenemus and Cryptocarenus) are not specifically indicated nor are species of Pinus for pine-inhabiting species. Observations are grouped by country, state, and locality; these data are not repeated in subsequent records; records are separated by semicolons.

Deletion of one of several structural genes for vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunits was previously demonstrated to prevent proper assembly of the remaining V1 subunits onto the vacuolar membrane (Kane, P.M., Kuehn, M.C., Howald-Stevenson, I., and Stevens, T.H.

Mutants were identified based on phenotypes associated with vacuolar membrane H(+)-ATPase loss of function (vma), including an inability to grow on media buffered at neutral pH. Representatives in five complementation groups were identified, including four novel mutant vma5, vma21, vma22, and vma23, all of which were defective in vacuolar ATPase enzyme activity.

Ohsumi and Y. Anraku ((1981) J. BioL Chem.256, 2079).The enzyme requires M&+ ion but not Ca2+ ion.Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions inhibit the activity.The optimal pH is at pH 7.0.The enzyme hydrolyzes ATP, GTP, U T P, and CTP in this order and the K, value for ATP was determined as 0.2 m ~.It does not hydrolyze ADP, adenosyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, orp-nitrophenyl phosphate.ADP does not inhibit hydrolysis of ATP by the enzyme.The activities of intact vacuoles and of vacuolar membrane vesicles were stimulated 3-and 1.5-fold, respectively, by the protonophore uncoupler 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzilidenemalononitrile and the K+/H' antiporter ionophore nigericin.Sodium azide at a concentration exerting an uncoupler effect also stimulated the activity.The activity was sensitive to the ATPase inhibitor N,Wdicyclohexylcarbodiimide, but not to sodium vanadate.The ATP-dependent formation of an electrochemical potential difference of protons, measured by the flowdialysis method, was determined as 180 mV, with contribution of 1.7 pH units, interior acid, and of a membrane potential of 76 mV.It is concluded that the M&+-ATPase of vacuoles is a new marker enzyme for these organelles and is a N,N""dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-sensitive, H+-translocating ATPase whose catalytic site is exposed to the cytoplasm.Recently, we established a procedure for preparing rightside-out vacuolar membrane vesicles of high purity from cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and showed that the vesicles catalyze active arginine transport which is driven by an electrochemical potential difference of protons formed by ATP hydrolysis (1).Subsequent studies on ATP hydrolysis by intact vacuoles and vacuolar membrane vesicles indicated the presence of a new Mg2'-ATPase with a catalytic site oriented externally.This paper describes the properties of vacuolar membranebound M8+-ATPase and its characteristic function as a H'translocating ATPase.The Mg2+-dependent, H+-translocating ATPase of the vacuoles was found to be a new specific marker of these organelles and t o differ from mitochondrial ATPase (2) and plasma membrane-bound ATPase (3,4).

At least three protein components of the crude membrane (Mr = 210,000, 160,000 and 115,000) are labeled with [gamma32P]ATP at pH 5.5.

While these three phosphorylated intermediates have not been unambiguously identified as components of the Mg2+-ATPase, the finding of such phosphorylated components in association with that activity implies that this enzyme differs in mechanism from the mitochondrial proton pump and that it is similar in mechanism to the metal ion pumps ((Na+-K+)-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase) of the mammalian plasma membrane.",W1503233261,False,0.0013873663265258074

The orientation of the proton gradient was acid inside and alkaline outside. Either phosphate or oxalate was necessary for transport, as was found for respiratory-driven or ATP-driven uptake (Tsuchiya, T., and Rosen, B.P. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 7687-7692). Phosphate accumulation was found to occur in conjunction with calcium accumulation. Calcium transport driven by an artificial proton gradient was stimulated by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an inhibitor of the Mg2+ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3). Valinomycin, which catalyzes electrogenic potassium movement, stimulated calcium accumulation, while nigericin, which catalyzes electroneutral exchange of potassium and protons, inhibited both artificial proton gradient-driven transport and respiratory-driven transport. Other properties of the proton gradient-driven system and the previously reported energy-linked calcium transport system are similar, indicating that calcium is transported by the same carrier whether energy is supplied through an artificial proton gradient or an energized membrane state. These results suggest the existence of a calcium/proton antiport.",W1523357342,False,0.0014089425094425678

Right-side-out vacuolar membrane vesicles were prepared from purified vacuoles. Arginine was taken up effectively by the vesicles only in the presence of ATP, not in the presence of ADP or AMP-adenosyl-5‘-yl imidodiphosphate. It was exchangeable and was released completely by a protonophore, 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzilidenemalononitrile (SF6847). The transport required Mg2+ ion but was inhibited by Cu2+, Ca2+, or Zn2+ ions. The transport activity was sensitive to the ATPase inhibitor N,N‘-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), but not to oligomycin or sodium vanadate. SF6847 or nigericin blocked arginine uptake completely, but valinomycin had no effect. ATP-dependent formation of a delta pH across the membrane vesicles was shown by quenching of 9-aminoacridine fluorescence. These results indicate that DCCD-sensitive, Mg2+-ATPase of vacuolar membranes is essential as an energy-donating system for the active transport, and that an electrochemical potential difference of protons is a driving force of this basic amino acid transport. Arginine transport showed saturation kinetics with a Km value of 0.6 mM and the mechanism was well explained by an H+/arginine antiport.",W1546910338,False,0.0004015551239717752

Arnow, Zofia Borowska, and Allen I. Laskin. Location and role of sterol at nystatin-binding sites. J. Bacteriol. 84: 1152–1160. 1962.—The polyene antifungal antibiotics nystatin and N -acetylcandidin were bound rapidly at 0 C by isolated cell walls and derived polysaccharides or by protoplast membranes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain LK2G12. These binding sites were relatively inaccessible or unreactive in the intact cell, since polyene uptake by protoplasts, log-phase cells, or stationary-phase cells was slow, especially at 0 C. Binding by the membrane appears to be the critical event in cell damage; thus, uptake of nystatin by the cell wall may actually be protective. Binding by all cell forms showed little reversibility. Bound radioactive nystatin or N -acetyl (1-C 14 ) candidin was not displaced during incubation of log-phase yeast cells with a large excess of unlabeled polyene. Saturation of the polyenic moiety of nystatin to form the perhydro compound eliminated almost completely the affinity of the molecule for the yeast cell. Essentially all of the polyene bound by protoplasts was present on the membrane. It was removed by treatment of the protoplasts with the sterol-complexing agent digitonin. A variety of evidence is offered that the binding site on the membrane contains a sterol. (The membrane sterol was mostly unesterified ergosterol.) This hypothesis is consistent with the ability of certain exogenous sterols to complex with polyenes and prevent their binding and growth-inhibiting action for fungi. The bound sterol of the wall structure may also participate in polyene binding, although a possible function of the wall polysaccharides cannot be excluded. The specific binding structure(s) appears to be absent from bacteria, since nystatin was not taken up even by heated or benzene-treated bacteria or by bacterial protoplasts. It should be noted that bacteria, which are insensitive to the polyene antibiotics, generally contain only traces of sterol, if any. Considerable quantities of sterol are present in fungi, algae, certain protozoa, and animal cells, all of which are sensitive in some degree.",W1520772165,False,0.5452901721000671

Membrane vesicles were first loaded with K+ by incubation at 40° in 0.5 m potassium phosphate and then transferred to K+-free medium. Addition of the potassium ionophores valinomycin, monactin, or enniatin elicited rapid efflux of K+ ions, down the concentration gradient, with the generation of a membrane potential, interior negative. These potassium ionophores also induced concentrative uptake of amino acids and sugars by the vesicles. By contrast, nigericin and monensin, which catalyze electrically neutral exchange of K+ or Na+ for H+, did not induce metabolite accumulation. Accumulation of proline in response to valinomycin was a function of the gradient of K+ concentration across the membrane. Accumulation was not affected by inhibitors of the respiratory chain nor by N, N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, but was completely abolished by reagents which render the membrane permeable to protons or which inhibit the transport carrier itself. The optimal external pH for valinomycin-induced proline uptake lay between 7 and 8; in addition, membrane vesicles prepared so as to create an alkaline lumen accumulated proline better than did those whose lumen pH was acid. The results suggest that the driving force for proline accumulation is the electrical potential; a pH gradient is not required. Potassium-loaded vesicles, prepared from a mutant defective in proline transport, failed to accumulate proline in response to valinomycin, but did accumulate glycine and thiomethyl-β-d-galactoside. This and other experiments with mutants and inhibitors strongly suggest that the accumulation driven by an artificial membrane potential is mediated by the physiological transport systems.

Methods for preparation and storage of the vesicles were devised to allow for the maximal activity and stability of the calcium transport system. The pH and temperature optima for the reaction were observed to occur at pH 8.0 AND 30 DEGREES, RESPECTIVELY. The eft was found that the extent of the reaction depended on the presence of phosphate or oxalate. Phosphate was found to enter the vesicles at a rate slower than that of calcium. A Ca2+:Pi ratio of approximately 1.5 was found, suggesting formation of Ca3(PO4)2. Monovalent cations stimulated calcium uptake, with the order of effectiveness being K+ is greater than Na+ is greater than Li+ is greater than NH4+. Inhibition was found with certain divalent cations, but these also inhibited the electron transport chain. Of the divalent cations examined only Mg2+ and Sr2+ inhibited calcium transport without a corresponding inhibition of respiration. Calcium transport exhibited biphasic Kinetics, with a low affinity system and a high affinity system. The low affinity system showed a Km of 0.34 mM and a Vmax of 85 nmol/min/mg of protein. The kinetic constants of the high affinity system were 4.5 muM and 2 nmol/min/mg of protein. The energy for calcium transport could be derived from the electron transport chain by oxidation of NADH, D-lactate, and succinate, in order of their effectiveness. Respiration-driven calcium transport was inhibited by inhibitors of the electron transport chain and by uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation.

The method entails sequential extraction of isolated vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) vesicles with deoxycholate and CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate), combination of CHAPS-solubilized protein with phospholipid-cholesterol mixtures, dialysis, and glycerol density gradient centrifugation. The final proteoliposome preparation is 9-fold enriched for PPase activity and active in pyrophosphate (PPi)-energized electrogenic H(+)-translocation. Since both PPi hydrolysis and PPi-dependent H(+)-translocation by the proteoliposomes are indistinguishable from the corresponding activities of native tonoplast vesicles, the functional integrity of the H(+)-PPase appears to be conserved during solubilization and reconstitution. The high transport capacity and amenability of the reconstituted enzyme to both radiometric membrane filtration and fluorimetric H(+)-translocation assays, on the other hand, demonstrate its applicability to a broad range of transport studies.

After adding excess Escherichia coli phospholipid as bath-sonicated liposomes, phosphate:sugar phosphate antiport was reconstituted in proteoliposomes by a 25-fold dilution in 0.1 M KPi (pH 7). Assays of 32Pi:Pi exchange showed that antiport was subject to an inactivation which varied in severity according to the lipid present at solubilization. Recovery of Pi-linked exchange was improved by the presence of 10-20% glycerol or other osmolyte during extraction. The osmolytes tested in this regard have included polyols (glycerol, erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol), sugars (glucose, trehalose), and two amino acids (glycine, proline). Each gave 10--20-fold increased recoveries of 32Pi:Pi antiport compared to controls using only detergent and lipid; these precautions were not required for the efficient reconstitution of F0F1-ATPase. Antiport in the artificial system was studied most carefully when glycerol was the stabilizing additive. For that case, the Kt values for Pi or 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate transport (275 and 25 microM, respectively) were the same as in native membranes. Maximal rates of Pi and 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate transport (200 and 42 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively) and the turnover number for Pi exchange (25--50/s) suggested that antiporters were recovered without loss of activity.

https://doi.org/10.1016/s0021-9258(19)47292-x,Biochemical characterization of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase,"Abstract The yeast vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase was isolated by two different methods. A previously reported purification of the enzyme (Uchida, E., Ohsumi, Y., and Anraku, Y. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 1090-1095) was repeated. This procedure consisted of isolation of vacuoles, solubilization with the zwitterionic detergent ZW3-14, and glycerol gradient centrifugation of the solubilized vacuoles. The fraction with the highest specific activity (11 mumol of ATP hydrolyzed mg-1 min-1) included eight polypeptides of apparent molecular masses of 100, 69, 60, 42, 36, 32, 27, and 17 kDa, suggesting that the enzyme may be more complex than the three-subunit composition proposed from the original purification. The 69-kDa polypeptide was recognized by antisera against the catalytic subunits of two other vacuolar ATPases and labeled with the ATP analog 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, indicating that it contains all or part of the catalytic site. A monoclonal antibody was prepared against this subunit. Under nondenaturing conditions, the antibody immunoprecipitated eight polypeptides, of the same molecular masses as those seen in the glycerol gradient fraction, from solubilized vacuolar vesicles. All eight of these polypeptides are therefore good candidates for being genuine subunits of the enzyme. The structure and function of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase were further characterized by examining the inhibition of ATPase activity by KNO3. In the presence of 5 mM MgATP, 100 mM KNO3 inhibited 71% of the ATPase activity of vacuolar vesicles, and the 69- and 60-kDa subunits (and possibly the 42-kDa subunit) were removed from the vacuolar membrane to a similar extent. At concentrations of less than 200 mM KNO3, the stripping of the ATPase subunits and the inhibition of ATPase activity were dependent on the presence of MgATP, suggesting that this is a conformation-specific disassembly of the enzyme. The yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase is a multisubunit enzyme, consisting of a combination of peripheral and integral membrane subunits. Its structure and subunit composition are very similar to other vacuolar ATPase, and it shares some characteristics with the F1F0-ATPases.",W1481801182,False,0.03731695935130119

The predicted amino acid sequence indicated that the C subunit consists of 373 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 42,287 Da. The protein from yeast is 37 identical in its amino acid sequence to the C subunit of bovine V-ATPase. The DNA fragment that was cloned in this study contained two additional reading frames. At the 5' end an amino acid sequence that is homologous to Artemia elongation factor 1 was detected. At the 3' end the N-terminal part of a kinesin-like protein was observed. The gene encoding subunit C of the V-ATPase was interrupted, and the resulting mutant could not grow at high pH and was sensitive to low and high Ca2+ concentrations in the growth medium. Transformation of the mutant by a plasmid containing the gene encoding subunit C repaired the phenotype of the mutant. Substitution of more than half of the coding region by a corresponding DNA fragment encoding the bovine subunit C resulted in a phenotype indistinguishable from wild type.

The gene encodes a hydrophilic protein of 382 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 43,989. Hydropathy plots revealed no apparent transmembrane segments and a rather high helix content was detected. A cDNA encoding most of the C subunit of the V-ATPase of human brain was also cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of this gene is almost identical to the bovine polypeptide with only one change of tyrosine 336 that was replaced by histidine in the human gene. Two polypeptide fragments derived from subunit E of V-ATPase from chromaffin granules were sequenced and found to be identical to the predicted amino acid sequence of this subunit from bovine kidney. These observations support the idea that the amino acid sequences of corresponding subunits from different V-ATPases are highly conserved. Unlike the A and B subunits of V-ATPases, that are homologous to the beta and alpha subunits of F-ATPases, subunits C and E showed no homology with analogous subunits of the F-ATPase family.

A study with 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole.","Subunit alpha (Mr 89,000) from vacuolar membrane H+-translocating adenosine triphosphatase of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was found to bind 8-azido[alpha-32P]adenosine triphosphate. Labeling by this photosensitive ATP derivative was saturable with an apparent dissociation constant of 10(-6) to 10(-5) M and decreased in the presence of ATP and ADP. The enzyme was inactivated by 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-Cl), with about 1 microM causing half-maximal inactivation in the neutral pH range. This inactivation was prevented by the presence of ATP, ADP, or adenosyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP). The original activity was restored by treating the inactivated enzyme with 2-mercaptoethanol. Kinetic and chemical studies of the inactivation showed that the activity was lost on chemical modification of a single tyrosine residue per molecule of the enzyme. When the enzyme was inactivated with [14C]NBD-Cl, subunit alpha was specifically labeled, and this labeling was completely prevented by the presence of ATP, GTP, ADP, or AMP-PNP. From these results, it was concluded that subunit alpha of yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase has a catalytic site that contains a single, essential tyrosine residue.

The purified enzyme was reconstituted as a highly active proton pump, and the binding of N-ethylmaleimide and nucleotides to individual subunits was studied. N-Ethylmaleimide binds to subunits I, II, and IV, but inhibition of both ATPase and proton pumping activity correlated with binding to subunit II. In the presence of ADP, the saturation curve of ATP changed from hyperbolic to a sigmoid shape, suggesting that the proton ATPase is an allosteric enzyme. Upon illumination of the purified enzyme in the presence of micromolar concentrations of 8-azido-ATP, alpha-[35S]ATP, or alpha-[32P]ATP subunits I, II, and IV were labeled. However, at concentrations of alpha-[32P]ATP below 0.1 microM, subunit II was exclusively labeled in both the purified and reconstituted enzyme. This labeling was absolutely dependent on the presence of divalent cations, like Mg2+ and Mn2+, while Ca2+, Co2+, and Zn2+ had little or no effect. About 0.2 mM Mg2+ was required to saturate the reaction even in the presence of 50 nM alpha-[32P]ATP, suggesting a specific and separate Mg2+ binding site on the enzyme. Nitrate, sulfate, and thiocyanate at 100 mM or N-ethylmaleimide and 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole at 100 microM prevented the binding of the nucleotide to subunit II. The labeling of this subunit was effectively prevented by micromolar concentrations of three phosphonucleotides including those that cannot serve as substrate for the enzyme.

We review several specific types of TIMs that are well understood to address whether the magnitude of the net modification changes with the number of modifiers, and whether modifiers usually increase or decrease each other's effects. 3. Modifications of interactions are generally not independent. It is likely that TIMs interact antagonistically in the majority of cases; the magnitudes of TIMs decrease as more modifiers are added, or new TIMs reduce the magnitudes of modifications that are already present. 4. Individual modifications are likely to have a smaller effect in many-species systems than expected from independent combination of modifications measured in systems with relatively few species. Thus, models that lack explicit TIMs may in some cases yield adequate predictions for species-level perturbations, provided that the net effects of TIMs are implicitly included in measured interaction strengths. 5. Many types of TIMs share structural similarities. Nevertheless, a complete understanding of their effects may require theory that distinguishes different 'functional groups' of modifiers and addresses how these are structured according to trophic relationships.",W1642515457,False,0.6439867615699768

D. Lack often interprets social behavior as an adaptation in part to an unbalanced (or balanced) sex ratio, and J. Verner has summarized other instances of this tendency. The only mechanism that will generate differential mortality independent of sexual differences clearly related to parental investment and sexual selection is the chromosomal mechanism, applied especially to humans and other mammals: the unguarded X chromosome of the male is presumed to predispose him to higher mortality. Each offspring can be viewed as an investment independent of other offspring, increasing investment in one offspring tending to decrease investment in others. Species can be classified according to the relative parental investment of the sexes in their young.

He describes studies of many different cryptic mechanisms by which a female can accept a male for copulation but nevertheless reject him as a father. Evidence from various fields indicates that such selectivity by females may be the norm rather than the exception. Because most post-copulatory competition between males for paternity is played out within the bodies of females, female behaviour, morphology, and physiology probably often influence male success in these contests. Eberhard draws examples from a diversity of organisms, ranging from ctenophores to scorpions, nematodes to frogs, and crickets to humans. Cryptic female choice establishes a new bridge between sexual selection theory and reproductive physiology, in particular the physiological effects of male seminal products on female reproductive processes, such as sperm transport, oviposition, and remating.

https://doi.org/10.1086/418300,Genetic Conflicts in Human Pregnancy,"Pragnancy has commonly been viewed as a cooperative interaction between a mother and her fetus. The effects of natural selection on genes expressed in fetuses, however, may be opposed by the effects of natural selection on genes expressed in mothers. In this sense, a genetic conflict can be said to exist between maternal and fetal genes. Fetal genes will be selected to increase the transfer of nutrients to their fetus, and maternal genes will be selected to limit transfers in excess of some maternal optimum. Thus a process of evolutionary escalation is predicted in which fetal actions are opposed by maternal countermeasures. The phenomenon of genomic imprinting means that a similar conflict exists within fetal cells between genes that are expressed when maternally derived, and genes that are expressed when paternally derived. During implantation, fetally derived cells (trophoblast) invade the maternal endometrium and remodel the endometrial spiral arteries into low-resistance vessels that are unable to constrict. This invasion has three consequences. First, the fetus gains direct access to its mother's arterial blood. Therefore, a mother cannot reduce the nutrient content of blood reaching the placenta without reducing the nutrient supply to her own tissues. Second, the volume of blood reaching the placenta becomes largely independent of control by the local maternal vasculature. Third, the placenta is able to release hormones and other substances directly into the maternal circulation. Placental hormones, including human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and human placental lactogen (hPL), are predicted to manipulate maternal physiology of fetal benefit. For example, hPL is proposed to act on maternal prolactin receptors to increase maternal resistance to insulin. If unopposed, the effect of hPL would be to maintain higher blood glucose levels for longer periods after meals. This action, however, is countered by increased maternal production of insulin. Gestational diabetes develops if the mother is unable to mount an adequate response to fetal manipulation. Similarly, fetal genes are predicted to enhance the flow of maternal blood through the placenta by increasing maternal blood pressure. Preeclampsia can be interpreted as an attempt by a poorly nourished fetus to increase its supply of nutrients by increasing the resistance of its mother's peripheral circulation.",W1968846073,False,0.13015040755271912

Plants face threats from a variety of herbivorous insects and can use induced responses to defend themselves against these attackers. Induced responses are mediated by signal transduction involving phytohormones, such as jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA). Cross‐talk between signal transduction pathways triggered by attackers with contrasting feeding styles allows plants to fine‐tune defences. A central question in this emerging field is to understand how responses to single attackers interfere with responses to other attackers, especially by integratively addressing molecular and ecological aspects. 2. We examined the plant‐mediated interactions between the leaf‐chewing Pieris brassicae and the phloem‐sucking Brevicoryne brassicae, and their respective parasitoids Cotesia glomerata and Diaeretiella rapae, when feeding simultaneously, sequentially or in isolation on the brassicaceous ecological model plant Brassica oleracea. We analysed the underlying defence mechanisms in the plant. Levels of the phytohormones JA and SA transcriptional responses of a number of selected defence‐related genes and secondary plant compounds were quantified at different time points during the single and multiple infestations. 3. The caterpillars developed faster and reached a larger body mass on plants previously attacked by aphids. Aphids initially developed faster on plants with caterpillars, although the moment of moulting to adults was independent of the presence of caterpillars. Both parasitoid species performed better under multiple‐infestation scenarios than in single‐herbivore situations. 4. On plants attacked by aphids, the JA levels were tenfold lower than on undamaged plants or plants with caterpillars. Additionally, the low transcript levels of LOX and MYC, genes coding for a JA biosynthesis‐related enzyme and a transcription factor, respectively, in aphid‐infested plants, suggest that the facilitation of the caterpillar performance was mediated by interference in signal transduction. Levels of carbon and nitrogen and secondary plant compounds (glucosinolates) did not differ significantly between treatments, suggesting that these compounds did not mediate the facilitation. 5. Our data show that the leaf chewer and phloem feeder asymmetrically interact not via competition as would be expected from interspecific herbivores but instead via facilitation; the phloem feeder attenuated JA‐related plant defences, thus facilitating the growth and development of the leaf chewers. In linear bitrophic systems, interactions between JA and SA signalling pathways have been proposed to allow plants to fine‐tune their defences, but if facilitation frequently occurs in interspecific interguild interactions among herbivores this may represent an important constraint for plant defences. Such a constraint might be reduced if, as in our model system, parasitoids also benefit from interactions between interguild hosts and nonhosts, but parasitoids are rarely considered in model molecular systems to assess the impact of herbivore‐induced plant defences.",W1513583702,False,0.8146650195121765

We constructed site-directed insertion mutations in the toxR gene by a novel method employing the chromosomal integration of a mobilizable suicide plasmid containing a portion of the toxR coding sequence. Mutants containing these new toxR alleles had an altered outer membrane protein profile, suggesting that two major outer membrane proteins (OmpT and OmpU) might be under the control of toxR. Physiological studies indicated that varying the concentration of the amino acids asparagine, arginine, glutamate, and serine caused coordinate changes in the expression of cholera toxin, TcpA, OmpT, and OmpU. Changes in the osmolarity of a tryptone-based medium also produced coordinate changes in the expression of these proteins. Other environmental signals (temperature and pH) had a more pronounced effect on the expression of cholera toxin and TcpA than they did on the outer membrane proteins. These results suggest that certain environmental signals (i.e., osmolarity and the presence of amino acids) are tightly coupled to the expression of toxR-regulated proteins and therefore may be signals that are directly sensed by the ToxR protein.",W1787690277,False,0.1752600222826004

Cross-talk between SA- and JA-dependent pathways can result in inhibition of JA-mediated defense responses. We investigated possible antagonistic interactions between the SA-dependent systemic acquired resistance (SAR) pathway, which is induced upon pathogen infection, and the JA-dependent induced systemic resistance (ISR) pathway, which is triggered by nonpathogenic Pseudomonas rhizobacteria. In Arabidopsis thaliana, SAR and ISR are effective against a broad spectrum of pathogens, including the foliar pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato ( Pst ). Simultaneous activation of SAR and ISR resulted in an additive effect on the level of induced protection against Pst. In Arabidopsis genotypes that are blocked in either SAR or ISR, this additive effect was not evident. Moreover, induction of ISR did not affect the expression of the SAR marker gene PR-1 in plants expressing SAR. Together, these observations demonstrate that the SAR and the ISR pathway are compatible and that there is no significant cross-talk between these pathways. SAR and ISR both require the key regulatory protein NPR1. Plants expressing both types of induced resistance did not show elevated Npr1 transcript levels, indicating that the constitutive level of NPR1 is sufficient to facilitate simultaneous expression of SAR and ISR.

,Quantitation of MYC gene expression in sporadic breast tumors with a real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay.,"MYC gene overexpression was identified recently as a downstream step at the end of the Wnt/APC/beta-catenin pathway dysregulation observed in colorectal cancer (T-C. He et al., Science (Washington DC), 281: 1509-1512, 1998). It thus appears that an excess of c-myc protein is a primary cause of numerous cancers. In breast cancer, MYC has been studied mostly at the DNA level because of the poor quality of available antibodies against the protein product. The renewed interest in MYC calls for a sensitive and accurate method for analyzing MYC overexpression in breast tumors. We have developed a real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay based on TaqMan fluorescence methodology to quantify the MYC mRNA copy number. We validated the method on a large series of breast tumors. MYC gene overexpression was observed in 29 of 134 (22%) breast tumor RNAs, ranging from 3.2 to 19 times the level in normal breast tissues. These data imply that dysregulated MYC gene expression is potentially involved in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, especially by favoring local cell proliferation. We also found that MYC gene overexpression was rarely due to an increased MYC gene copy number in breast cancer. This new, simple, rapid, and semiautomated method will be useful for screening cancer patients for MYC overexpression and will prove a powerful tool in large, randomized, prospective, cooperative group trials and in the MYC-based therapy project.",W1783699960,False,0.004494537599384785
https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.1999.17.7.2264,Molecular Biology of Neuroblastoma,"PURPOSE AND RESULTS: Neuroblastoma, the most common solid extracranial neoplasm in children, is remarkable for its clinical heterogeneity. Complex patterns of genetic abnormalities interact to determine the clinical phenotype. The molecular biology of neuroblastoma is characterized by somatically acquired genetic events that lead to gene overexpression (oncogenes), gene inactivation (tumor suppressor genes), or alterations in gene expression. Amplification of the MYCN proto-oncogene occurs in 20% to 25% of neuroblastomas and is a reliable marker of aggressive clinical behavior. No other oncogene has been shown to be consistently mutated or overexpressed in neuroblastoma, although unbalanced translocations resulting in gain of genetic material from chromosome bands 17q23-qter have been identified in more than 50% of primary tumors. Some children have an inherited predisposition to develop neuroblastoma, but a familial neuroblastoma susceptibility gene has not yet been localized. Consistent areas of chromosomal loss, including chromosome band 1p36 in 30% to 35% of primary tumors, 11q23 in 44%, and 14q23-qter in 22%, may identify the location of neuroblastoma suppressor genes. Alterations in the expression of the neurotrophins and their receptors correlate with clinical behavior and may reflect the degree of neuroblastic differentiation before malignant transformation. Alterations in the expression of genes that regulate apoptosis also correlate with neuroblastoma behavior and may help to explain the phenomenon of spontaneous regression observed in a well-defined subset of patients. CONCLUSION: The molecular biology of neuroblastoma has led to a combined clinical and biologic risk stratification. Future advances may lead to more specific treatment strategies for children with neuroblastoma.",W1951128322,False,0.0004137914802413434

Common traits of the Minute phenotype are short and thin bristles, slow development, and recessive lethality. By mobilizing a P element inserted in the 5′ UTR of M(3)95A, the gene encoding ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), we have generated two homozygous viable heteroalleles that are partial revertants with respect to the Minute phenotype. Molecular characterization revealed both alleles to be imprecise excisions, leaving 40 and 110 bp, respectively, at the P-element insertion site. The weaker allele (40 bp insert) is associated with a ~15% decrease in RPS3 mRNA abundance and displays a moderate Minute phenotype. In the stronger allele (110 bp insert) RPS3 mRNA levels are reduced by ~60%, resulting in an extreme Minute phenotype that includes many morphological abnormalities as well as sterility in both males and females due to disruption of early gametogenesis. The results show that there is a correlation between reduced RPS3 mRNA levels and the severity of the Minute phenotype, in which faulty differentiation of somatic tissues and arrest of gametogenesis represent the extreme case. That heteroalleles in M(3)95A can mimic the phenotypic variations that exist between different Minute/rp-gene mutations strongly suggests that all phenotypes primarily are caused by reductions in maximum protein synthesis rates, but that the sensitivity for reduced levels of the individual rp-gene products is different.",W1931007673,False,0.004324879962950945

D-p40 shares 63% identity with the human p40 ribosomal protein. P element-mediated transformation of a 4.4-kb genomic fragment encompassing the 1-kb transcript corresponding to D-p40 was used to rescue both a lethal (sta2) and a viable (sta1) mutation at the stubarista (sta) locus. Developmental analysis of the sta2 mutation implicates a requirement for D-p40 during oogenesis and imaginal development, which is consistent with the expression of sta throughout development. In addition, we have analyzed the basis of the sta1 visible phenotype which consists of shortened antennae and bristles. sta1 is a translocation of the 1E1-2 to 2B3-4 region of the X chromosome onto the third chromosome at 89B21-C4. We provide genetic evidence that Dp(1;3)sta1 is mutant at the spineless (ss) locus and that it is associated with partial D-p40 activity. We demonstrate that sta1 acts as a recessive enhancer of ss; reduction in the amount of D-p40 provided by the transposed X chromosomal region of sta1 reveals a haplo-insufficient phenotype of the otherwise recessive ss mutations. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the enhancing effect observed with Minute mutations, one of which, rp49, has previously been shown to encode a ribosomal protein.",W1902946247,False,0.006660879589617252

Furthermore, synthesis of those RNAs and proteins occurs in the same temporal order as occurs in vivo during the first minutes after T4 infection. The relative molar yields of early proteins in vitro are similar to the relative yields obtained in vivo.

As the book got underway the limits of my knowledge became distressingly apparent, and I now feel I learned most of its contents along the way.

Legacy effects of plant influences on abiotic and biotic soil properties can result in priority effects that influence the structure and composition of plant communities. To better understand the role of these plant–soil interactions, here we expand the concept of plant–soil feedbacks from a within-species approach (intraspecific plant–soil feedback) to a between-species approach (interspecific plant–soil interactions). 2. In a greenhouse experiment, we tested how the early successional Jacobaea vulgaris affects its own performance and the performance of 30 co-occurring plant species via changes in abiotic and biotic soil conditions. In addition, we examined the reciprocal effect of the co-occurring species on J. vulgaris. 3. Our study had three important results. First, J. vulgaris exhibits strong negative plant–soil feedback. Secondly, there were large differences among the co-occurring species in interspecific plant–soil effects on J. vulgaris growth. Approximately, half the species reduced J. vulgaris performance, whereas the other half had no effect. Thirdly, soil conditioned by J. vulgaris had a positive or neutral effect on the growth of the co-occurring species. 4. To test the soil effects of entire plant communities, in 10 old-fields that differed in time since abandonment we recorded the identity of all plants surrounding J. vulgaris individuals. We calculated the weighted soil effect of this community on J. vulgaris and the reciprocal effect of J. vulgaris on the community. There was a positive linear relationship between time since abandonment and the weighted feedback effect of J. vulgaris on the plant community. 5. We suggest three mechanisms how the legacy of plant–soil interactions may enhance the rate of succession through priority effects: early successional plant species exert negative plant–soil feedback; co-occurring plant species cause negative interspecific plant–soil effects to the early successional species; and the early successional species have overall positive interspecific plant–soil effects on the co-occurring plant species. 6. Synthesis. The performance of an early successional species can be reduced directly by the legacy effects of intraspecific plant–soil feedback, as well as indirectly by the legacy effects of both intra- and interspecific plant–soil interactions. These intra- and interspecific plant–soil interactions can prioritize transitions of plant species in plant communities.",W1494555613,False,0.8495285511016846

Upon facing biotic stresses, plants orchestrate defence mechanisms via internal and external mechanisms that are mediated by signalling molecules such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, ethylene and various other volatile compounds. Although pathogen‐ and chemical‐induced plant resistance has been studied extensively within the same plant compartment, the effects of above‐ground (AG) insect‐elicited plant defence on the resistance expression in roots and the below‐ground (BG) microbial community are not well understood. 2. We assessed the effect of AG whitefly ( Bemisia tabaci ) attack on the elicitation of induced resistance against a leaf pathogen, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria, a soil‐borne pathogen, Ralstonia solanacearum, and on BG modifications of the rhizosphere microflora in peppers ( Capsicum annuum ). 3. Symptom development caused by the two bacterial pathogens on leaves and roots was significantly reduced in whitefly‐exposed plants as compared to controls. A combined treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH) and whitefly caused an additive effect on induced resistance, indicating that whitefly‐induced plant defence can utilize salicylic acid (SA)‐dependent signalling. To obtain further genetic evidence of this phenomenon, we evaluated the gene expression of Capsicum annuum pathogenesis‐related protein ( CaPR ) 1, CaPR4, CaPR10 and Ca protease inhibitor II, and observed increased expression after BTH and/or whitefly treatment indicating that AG whitefly infestation elicited SA and jasmonic acid signalling in AG and BG. Since the expression pattern of PR genes in the roots differed, we assessed microbial diversity in plants treated with BTH and/or whitefly. 4. In addition to eliciting BG defence responses, a whitefly infestation of the leaves augmented the population of root‐associated Gram‐positive bacteria and fungi, which may have positively affected plant growth and induced systemic resistance. Whitefly feeding reduced plant size, which usually occurs as a consequence of the high costs of direct resistance induction. 5. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate that whitefly‐induced resistance against bacterial pathogens can cross the AG–BG border and may cause further indirect benefits on future plant development, because it can positively affect the association or plant roots with putatively beneficial microorganisms.",W1486864033,False,0.8531351089477539

https://doi.org/10.18174/200061,The resistance of insects to plant proteinase inhibitors,"The research reported in this thesis describes the induction of proteinase inhibitor synthesis in solanaceous plants (tobacco and tomato), when lepidopteran larvae (Manduca sexta and Spodoptera exigua) are feeding on leaves. It is shown that the larvae circumvent the proteinase inhibitor defense of these plants by the induction of non-susceptible gut proteinases. A phage display method is presented, which may allow the isolation of PIs that are also active against the non-susceptible proteinases of insects. It is expected that the application of such PIs can complement the natural PI defense of plants, and result in the protection of transgenic plants against insects.Chapter one provides a general introduction to plant PIs It describes the different PI families identified in plants, their mode of action against serine proteinases and the available evidence for a defensive role in plants. The effects of dietary PIs in insects are reviewed, and the physiological mechanisms resulting in growth depression in vertebrates are discussed. Chapter two presents a simple, but powerful method to measure quantitatively activities of a wide range of serine proteinase inhibitors using a radial diffusion assay. The assay can detect as little as 2-20 pmol PI, the error is between 4-12%, and the detection range can vary by three orders of magnitude. In chapter three the induction of endogenous PIs in response to insect attack is compared to the response after mechanical wounding and virus infection. It is demonstrated that local induction of PIs after insect attack is very strong in mature tobacco and tomato plants, but that systemic induction is virtually absent. Instead of direct systemic PI induction, it is observed that wounding several leaves at once, creates locally a stronger wound response. This suggests the presence of a systemic factor, which regulates the strength of the local wound response by silent alarm. Chapter four describes the induction of proteinase activity insensitive to plant PIs in the gut of Spodoptera exigua larvae, when the insects are feeding on tobacco leaves containing either potato PI2 or endogenous tobacco PIs It is demonstrated that PIs decrease the proteinase activity in larval guts, but that this reduction is partially compensated for by the induction of PI-insensitive proteinase activity. The weight of larvae, fed with PI leaves, was not reduced, so that the induced PI-insensitive activity, apparently sufficiently, compensated proteinase activity lost by inhibition. Chapter five describes the analysis of gut proteinase activity of S. exigua larvae. Six major proteinase activities were identified and three were purified by anion exchange chromatography and further analyzed. One of the purified proteinases was a cysteine proteinase with optimal activity at pH 11 and is the first example of this class of proteinase to be isolated from a lepidopteran insect. Chapter six demonstrates that potato P12 can be displayed as a functional protein on M13-phages by fusion to a minor coat protein. It is shown that functional PI2-phages mixed with non-functional phages can be enriched 323,000-fold against trypsin after three selection rounds. Large engineered phage libraries of PI2-variants allow the selection of PI2 clones with high affinity for PI-insensitive proteinases; of insect pests. Finally, chapter seven discusses the results comprehensively to defend the thesis that insects acquire resistance against the PIs induced in their host plants. It is argued that the successful application of PIs for resistance breeding will require the selection of better PI genes and that phage display offers a suitable method for this purpose.",W1501842291,False,0.47415411472320557

Samsun NN) leaves produce a serine proteinase inhibitor that has evolved a specificity for microbial proteinases. We have isolated two closely related cDNAs that were shown to encode two active inhibitors. Southern analysis of genomic DNA, comparison of deduced amino acid sequences, and characterization of the two separated proteins suggest that the two genes of tobacco are homologous originating from each parent. Amino acid sequences deduced from the cDNAs exhibit a glutamic residue at the P1 position of the active site, known to determine the specificity of this type of inhibitors. Nevertheless, the V8 proteinase from Staphylococcus aureus, an enzyme that cleaves polypeptides after glutamic acid residues, was found to be unaffected by the tobacco inhibitor. We demonstrate strong accumulation of the two mRNAs and proteins during the hypersensitive reaction of tobacco to tobacco mosaic virus. Messengers and products of the two genes are present in a 3:2 ratio, in infected leaves as well as in upper uninfected leaves, the induction being markedly lower at distance from the infection site. The transcripts were also found in sepals and petals of healthy plants, indicating that these genes are also developmentally regulated. Unlike the tomato and potato I inhibitors, the tobacco inhibitor was only weakly induced by wounding, but was expressed upon salicylic acid or ethephon treatment, as many pathogenesis-related proteins.",W1525982503,False,0.6898144483566284

A clone (CaPR-4) encoding a putative pathogenesis-related protein 4 was isolated by differential screening of a cDNA library prepared from resistant pepper plant leaves inoculated with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) pathotype P0. The predicted amino acid sequence of CaPR-4 is very similar to those of other plant PR-4s. Southern blot analysis showed that small gene families of PÆ-4-related sequences were present in the pepper genome. Hot pepper cultivar Bugang, resistant to TMV-P0 and susceptible to TMV-P1.2, induced CaPR-4 expression by pathotype P0 inoculation in inoculated and systemic leaves, but not by pathotype P1.2. Effects of exogenously applied abiotic elicitors upon the CaPR-4 expression were also examined. The expression of the CaPR-4 gene was stimulated by methyl jasmonate (MeJA), ethephon and wounding treatment. However, application of salicylic acid (SA) did not trigger the expression. Evidence is emerging that jasmonic acid and ethylene play key roles in the SA-independent pathways of plant-pathogen interaction. Taken together, these results suggest that the CaPR-4 gene is one of the defense-related genes conferring resistance on pepper plants by the SA- independent pathway and the cross-talk between signaling compounds, jasmonic acid and ethylene could have a great regulatory potential in a plant's defense against TMV.",W124551381,False,0.542476236820221

Microorganisms loosely attached to the substrate (overstory) and those strongly adhering to the substrate (understory) were considered separately. Community biomass accumulation resulted from increases in the overstory. Cell numbers remained relatively unchanged in the understory. As the community developed, the uptake of glucose, inorganic carbon, ammonia, and phosphate increased, mainly because of autotrophic organisms in the overstory. Organisms in the understory, especially bacteria, appeared to contribute significantly to the assimilation of glucose. The spiralling concept of nutrient reutilization in running waters was assessed in view of the changing physiology of the microorganisms comprising a developing biofilm. Release, downstream translocation, and subsequent biological assimilation of recently fixed bicarbonate, glucose, and orthophosphate was measured. The translocation of bicarbonate and glucose release products was similar in both poorly developed and well-developed communities, whereas orthophosphate metabolites were reassimilated more rapidly in well-developed assemblages. The apparent conservation of phosphate by the epilithic community was considered to be a physiological adaptation in response to the low nutrient concentration of the waters. Organic carbon, conversely, was probably not limiting and therefore was not rapidly reutilized.

https://doi.org/10.1086/285092,The Ratio of Nitrogen to Phosphorus Resupplied by Herbivores: Zooplankton and the Algal Competitive Arena,"The influence of pelagic herbivores on the competitive arena of their prey is examined in three models of herbivore physiology. One hallmark of pelagic herbivory is the rapid and fight cycling of nutrients among algae, herbivores,and the dissolved phase. An implication of this cycling is that the ratio of elements released by the herbivore is a ""supply ratio"" as defined in resource-competition theory. The nitrogen (N)-to-phosphorus (P) supply ratio depends on the assumptions made regarding grazer physiology. Three alternative models are considered: (1) a constant, mass-specific basal metabolic release of N and P; (2) a constant efficiency of accumulating N and P in grazer biomass; and (3) an adjusting efficiency of N and P accumulation that maintains a homeostatic ratio of N to P (N:P) in the bodies of the grazers. All three models predict a positive correlation between the N:P in the algal pool and that released by the animals. Previously published data provided strong supportive evidence for this relationship. Studies that have used the N-to-P concentration ratio as a proxy for the N-to-P supply ratio are therefore reinforced. The model of basal metabolism is rendered unrealistic by a lack of relationship between the N:P released by grazers and that in the zooplankton pool. The other two models differ only in whether grazers maintain a homeostasis of the N: P in their bodies. A review of the literature together with an analysis of independently gathered data indicate that homeostasis of the N:P is a reasonable constraint but that homeostasis is not strict. Constant accumulation predicts a direct proportionality between the N:P released and the N:P in the algal pool. Homeostasis predicts a curvilinearity in this relationship (though it may be only a shallow bend for some realistic parameters). The curvilinearity is such that imbalances of the N:P in the food compared with that in the zooplankton are accentuated. Comparison of the N:P released calculated from alternatives 2 and 3 with measured values showed good agreement with both models, but especially for the homeostatic one. The homeostatic model is thus the most realistic. Homeostatic grazers appear to establish an unstable equilibrium in the N: P in the algal pool and thus, presumably, in the nutrient-limitation patterns of the algae. Whichever element appears in the food in low relative proportion will be recycled by the grazer with relatively low efficiency. The model of strict homeostasis thus predicts a role for grazers not predicted by other theoretical approaches: grazers cause the nutrient-limitation patterns of their algal prey to diverge. Algal communities receiving their nutrients primarily from homeostatic grazers are expected to become limited by either N or P, but not by both. Suggestive evidence from the literature for such dynamics is cited.",W1998268923,False,0.6410419940948486

Debate focuses on whether the rule should be described in terms of pattern or process, what taxa it should apply to and what taxonomic level it should be associated with. Here I review the historical development of studies of Bergmann's Rule. I suggest that Bergmann thought that his rule should be strongest at the intra‐specific level, rather than between closely related species as is usually thought.

However, more than 150 years on, we appear to be little closer to a general understanding of the rule, or even to any consensus as to whether it exists. This is due in large part to confusion about the taxonomic level at which the rule is considered to operate, and to the conflation of pattern and mechanism. In this paper, we attempt to resolve this confusion by highlighting its sources, and by providing a definition of Bergmann's rule that is practical and useful, yet that retains the essential features of its original formulation.

As a result, individuals growing up in cool conditions grow slower, mature later, but are larger at maturation than those growing up in warm conditions. To date, no entirely satisfactory explanation has been found for why this pattern, often called the temperature-size rule, should exist. Previous theoretical models have assumed that size-specific mortality rates were most likely to drive the pattern. Here, I extend one theoretical model to show that variation in size-fecundity relationships may also be important. Plasticity in the size-fecundity relationship has rarely been considered, but a number of studies show that fecundity increases more quickly with size in cold environments than it does in warm environments. The greater increase in fecundity offsets costs of delayed maturation in cold environments, favoring a larger size at maturation.

An organism's environment, particularly early in development, can profoundly shape its future phenotypes. While the long-term consequences of embryonic temperature are well studied in vertebrates, insects have complex life cycles that may uncouple temperature's effects in one stage from physiology in the next. 2. This study examines how egg temperature affects insect performance across all subsequent life stages. We focused on the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, and examined how egg temperatures affected hatching time, hatchling mass, larval growth, development time, head capsule size, pupal mass and adult fecundity. Eggs were exposed to either diurnal temperature cycles or a single heat shock; in both experiments, temperatures were within the range to which eggs are typically exposed in the field. 3. Although the consequences of egg temperature varied depending on the type of treatment, both cycling temperatures and heat shock affected egg development time and initial larval growth rate, which likely have fitness consequences for M. sexta in nature. In contrast, egg temperature had no persistent effect on any trait measured in later larval stages, pupae or adults. 4. Organisms with complex life cycles –Manduca has four distinct life stages and multiple larval sub-stages – may benefit from rapid compensation for poor early conditions. Additionally, the modularity of insect life cycles may help insects cope with environmental variability by insulating later stages from disturbances during embryogenesis.",W1581879112,False,0.7506344318389893

,Temperature and the cell cycle.,"During the period between successive divisions, a cell traverses three stages of interphase: G1 (pre-synthetic interphase), S-phase (DNA synthetic interphase) and G2 (post-synthetic interphase). The time taken for all cells in a meristem to divide (the cell doubling time (cdt] decreases in response to an increase in temperature. For example, the cdt in root meristems of Zea mays decreases 21-fold as the temperature is increased from 3 to 25 degrees C. Whether all phases of the cell cycle alter proportionately with temperature has been ascertained by comparing data from the root meristem of five species: Pisum sativum, Helianthus annuus, Tradescantia paludosa, Allium cepa and Triticum aestivum. In three of the five species there is a disproportionate lengthening of the G1 phase at low temperatures. We suggest that arrest in G1 with the associated 2C amount of DNA, confers maximal protection on the genome of a somatic cell to the stress of low temperature. DNA replication has been studied at different temperatures for Helianthus annuus, Secale cereal and Oryza sativa. The rate of DNA replication, per single replication fork, increases when the temperature is raised, while the distance between initiation points (replicon size) remains constant. The temperature at which the cell cycle has a minimum duration is close to 30 degrees C in many species, and it seems that this optimum temperature is always near the upper temperature limit of the cell cycle. The rate of cell division determines the rates of organ and cell growth. Thus, temperature has a major effect on the way in which meristematic cells are deployed in organogenesis. The rate of organogenesis, in turn, determines the response of the plant to the growing season. We predict that species growing in sub-arctic conditions comprise cells with low DNA contents and hence have the potentialities for rapid cell cycles so that maximum advantage can be taken of a short growing season. Data from Triticum aestivum show that at 5 degrees C, nucleoli are large compared with those at 10-25 degrees C. These observations are consistent with high levels of RNA polymerase and cellular RNA found at low compared with high temperatures. These responses may be important in sustaining growth at 5 degrees C. Finally, the effects of temperature on developmental transitions are discussed.

Some 11,000-10,000 years ago bands of hunter-gatherers started to abandon their high-mobility lifestyles in favour of growing crops, and the creation of settled, sedentary communities. This shift into an agricultural lifestyle triggered the evolution of complex political and economic structures, and technological developments, and ultimately underpinned the rise of all the great civilisations of recent human history. This book reviews and synthesises the information on the origins and domestication of cultivated plants in the Old World, and subsequently the spread of cultivation from southwest Asia into Asia, Europe, and North Africa, from the very earliest beginnings. This book is mainly based on detailed consideration of two lines of evidence: the plant remains found at archaeological sites, and the knowledge that has accumulated about the present-day wild relatives of domesticated plants. This new edition revises and updates previous data and incorporates the most recent findings from molecular biology about the genetic relations between domesticated plants and their wild ancestors, and incorporates extensive new archaeological data about the spread of agriculture within the region. The reference list has been completely updated, as have the list of archaeological sites and the site maps.",W128812734,False,0.0014713960699737072
https://doi.org/10.1086/670679,A Contextual Approach to the Emergence of Agriculture in Southwest Asia,"The scale and nature of early cultivation are topics that have received relatively limited attention in research on the origins of agriculture. In Southwest Asia, one the earliest centers of origin worldwide, the transition to food production is commonly portrayed as a macroevolutionary process from hunter-gatherer through to cultivator-forager and farming stages. Climate change, resource intensification, sedentism, rising population densities, and increasing social complexity are widely considered by prehistorians as pivotal to the emergence of protoagricultural village life. In this paper we revisit these narratives that have been influenced by culture-history and social evolution, together forming the dominant theoretical paradigms in the prehistory of Southwest Asia. We propose a complementary contextual approach seeking to reconstruct the historical development of Early Holocene plant-food production and its manifold sociocultural environments by intersecting multiple lines of evidence on the biology of plant domestication, resource management strategies, settlement patterns, cultivation and harvesting technologies, food storage, processing and consumption, ritual practices and symbolic behaviors. Furthermore, we propose that early plant-food production in Southwest Asia should be dissociated from ethnographically derived notions of sedentary village life. Plants emerge as important components of community interactions and ritual performances involving suprahousehold groups that were mediated through communal food consumption.",W1526447745,False,0.4198642075061798

These results were then considered in relation to the new photosynthetic carboxylation pathway proposed by Hatch et al., rates of photosynthesis, grass systematics, leaf anatomy, and distribution of starch in the leaf. Plants possessing the new carboxylation pathway had low compensation values whereas those having the Calvin carboxylation reaction had high values. Low compensation plants also had a well-developed parenchyma bundle sheath containing a high concentration of chloroplasts which accumulated large amounts of starch. Little or no starch was present in the mesophyll cells. Cyperus was exceptional in that it also formed appreciable starch in the mesophyll. Those low compensation members of the Gramineae tested belonged either to the chloridoid–eragrostoid or the panicoid lines of evolution. A literature survey indicated that low compensation grasses have photosynthetic rates that are about double those of plants with photorespiration correlated with a temperature optimum for photosynthesis of about 35 °C. Those plants with photorespiration have optima within the range 10–25 °C. Some simple assay procedures proposed on the basis of the above correlations allow rapid determination of the physiological and biochemical status of plants with respect to photosynthesis.",W2002456804,False,0.720272958278656

Young inoculated roots of pearl millet and guinea grass produced more mucilaginous sheath (mucigel), root hairs, and lateral roots than did uninoculated sterile controls. The bacteria were found within the mucigel that accumulated on the root cap and along the root axes. Adherent bacteria were associated with granular material on root hairs and fibrillar material on undifferentiated epidermal cells. Significantly fewer numbers of azospirilla attached to millet root hairs when the roots were grown in culture medium supplemented with 5 mM potassium nitrate. Under these growth conditions, bacterial attachment to undifferentiated epidermal cells was unaffected. Aseptically collected root exudate from pearl millet contained substances which bound to azospirilla and promoted their adsorption to the root hairs. This activity was associated with nondialyzable and proteasesensitive substances in root exudate. Millet root hairs adsorbed azospirilla in significantly higher numbers than cells of Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, Azotobacter, Klebsiella, or Escherichia. Pectolytic activities, including pectin transeliminase and endopolygalacturonase, were detected in pure cultures of A. brasilense when this species was grown in a medium containing pectin.

Estimated rates of N2 fixation associated with field-grown corn and sorghum plants were less than 4 g of N2/ha per day. The mean estimated N2-fixation rates determined on segments of roots from corn inoculated with Spirillum and grown in the greenhouse at 24 to 27 degrees C were 15 g of N2/ha per day (16 inbreds), 25 g of N2/ha per day (six hybrids), and 165 g of N2/ha per day for one hybird which was heavily inoculated.

Lower rates of C2H2 reduction were associated with control corn cultures which had been treated with autoclaved Spirillum than with cultures inoculated with live Spirillum. No C2H2 reduction was detected in plant cultures treated with ammonium nitrate. Numbers of nitrogen-fixing bacteria on excised roots of corn plants increased an average of about 30-fold during an overnight preincubation period, and as a result acetylene reduction assays of root samples after preincubation failed to serve as a valid basis for estimating N2 fixation by corn in pot cultures. Plants grown without added nitrogen either with or without inoculum exhibited severe symptoms of nitrogen deficiency and in most cases produced significantly less dry weight than those supplied with fixed nitrogen.

The PvME1 promoter directed strong expression in stems, which was confined to vascular and pith tissues, and was also active in floral and reproductive tissues. Wounding caused a marked induction of promoter activity, which was further strongly enhanced upon application of stimuli related to pathogen defense. Glutathione (reduced form) was the strongest inducer, but oxidized glutathione, fungal elicitor, cellulase, catalase, ascorbic acid, and NADPH were additional potent promoter-stimulating agents. Responsiveness to reduced glutathione was also shown at the level of PvME1 mRNA accumulation in bean plants.

https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.103.1.83,C4 Photosynthesis (The CO2-Concentrating Mechanism and Photorespiration),"Despite previous reports of no apparent photorespiration in C4 plants based on measurements of gas exchange under 2 versus 21% O2 at varying [CO2], photosynthesis in maize (Zea mays) shows a dual response to varying [O2]. The maximum rate of photosynthesis in maize is dependent on O2 (approximately 10%). This O2 dependence is not related to stomatal conductance, because measurements were made at constant intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci); it may be linked to respiration or pseudocyclic electron flow. At a given Ci, increasing [O2] above 10% inhibits both the rate of photosynthesis, measured under high light, and the maximum quantum yield, measured under limiting light ([phi]CO2). The dual effect of O2 is masked if measurements are made under only 2 versus 21% O2. The inhibition of both photosynthesis and [phi]CO2 by O2 (measured above 10% O2) with decreasing Ci increases in a very similar manner, characteristically of O2 inhibition due to photorespiration. There is a sharp increase in O2 inhibition when the Ci decreases below 50 [mu]bar of CO2. Also, increasing temperature, which favors photorespiration, causes a decrease in [phi]CO2 under limiting CO2 and 40% O2. By comparing the degree of inhibition of photosynthesis in maize with that in the C3 species wheat (Triticum aestivum) at varying Ci, the effectiveness of C4 photosynthesis in concentrating CO2 in the leaf was evaluated. Under high light, 30[deg]C, and atmospheric levels of CO2 (340 [mu]bar), where there is little inhibition of photosynthesis in maize by O2, the estimated level of CO2 around ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) in the bundle sheath compartment was 900 [mu]bar, which is about 3 times higher than the value around Rubisco in mesophyll cells of wheat. A high [CO2] is maintained in the bundle sheath compartment in maize until Ci decreases below approximately 100 [mu]bar. The results from these gas exchange measurements indicate that photorespiration occurs in maize but that the rate is low unless the intercellular [CO2] is severely limited by stress.",W1530433484,False,0.7258598208427429

Photorespiratory glycine oxidation and related enzyme activities of mesophyll and bundle sheath mitochondria were compared. Mesophyll mitochondria showed good P/O ratios with malate and succinate as substrate but lacked the ability to oxidize glycine. On the other hand, mitochondria isolated from bundle sheath protoplasts of P. miliaceum and bundle sheath strands of Z. mays possessed glycine oxidation activity similar to that of mitochondria from C3 plant leaves. The two enzymes involved in glycine metabolism in mitochondria, serine hydroxymethyltransferase and glycine decarboxylase, were also assayed in the mitochondria of the two cell types. The activities of the two enzymes in bundle sheath mitochondria were in the range found in C3 mitochondria. In contrast, the activities in mesophyll mitochondria were either not detectable or far lower than those in bundle sheath mitochondria and ascribed to contaminating bundle sheath mitochondria.

In bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), PAL is encoded by a family of three genes. We show here by RNase protection with gene-specific probes that these genes are expressed differentially during development and in response to different environmental cues. While all three genes are expressed at high levels in roots, only PAL1 and PAL2 are expressed in shoots and only PAL1 is expressed in leaves. Strikingly, PAL2 is expressed at very high levels in petals, where PAL1 is only very weakly expressed and PAL3 is not expressed. All three genes are induced by mechanical wounding of hypocotyls, but fungal infection only activates PAL1 and PAL3. Illumination of etiolated hypocotyls activates PAL1 and PAL2 but not PAL3. Corresponding differential patterns of synthesis of specific PAL polypeptide isoforms were observed by two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis of in vitro translation products encoded by RNA isolated from hypocotyls stimulated by light, wounding, or infection. The specific isoforms encoded by transcripts of the three PAL genes were identified by inhibition of synthesis in vitro with gene-specific anti-sense transcripts followed by comparative two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis of the pattern of translation products. These data indicate that selective expression of PAL genes encoding functional variants is governed by a complex set of regulatory networks for developmental and environmental control of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.",W1566384129,False,0.3146493136882782

The proposed system uses the features of existing widely used classification systems that are amenable to data derived from remote sensing sources. It is intentionally left open-ended so that Federal, regional, State, and local agencies can have flexibility in developing more detailed land use classifications at the third and fourth levels in order to meet their particular needs and at the same time remain compatible with each other and the national system.

Therefore, we combined three published data sets of stream macroinvertebrate abundances collected at three spatial scales with a database of functional species traits (e.g. life history, morphology, physiology, and behaviour). We investigated the abundance of taxa and their traits at five levels of taxonomic (from species to class) and three levels of spatial resolution (from local habitat to catchment). We used multivariate analyses and correlations to evaluate the accuracy of community descriptions through the stability of such descriptions, the degree of similarity of site ordinations, and the overall community structure expressed at each taxonomic level. The accuracy of community descriptions based on the abundance of taxa depended on the spatial scale considered. The accurate description of the abundance of taxa required identifications to genera and/or families on the local habitat scale, while species identifications were needed on the catchment scale. In contrast, the accurate description of the abundance of biological traits was achieved by identifications to species, genera, or families on all three spatial scales. Thus, species identifications may not be necessary for future studies on the functional diversity of the stream benthos at different spatial scales.",W180796874,False,0.7256468534469604

https://doi.org/10.2307/3237077,Disturbance response in vegetation – towards a global perspective on functional traits,"Abstract. Previous work on trait correlation patterns has contributed to the identification of broad patterns of plant distribution along environmental gradients in vegetation. However, these general trends may conceal subtle mechanisms of response that are specific to particular types of disturbance. To address this, we propose a generic methodology for the analysis of traits, using herb‐dominated vegetation as a model. Hypothetical biological traits are identified for testing against disturbance gradients. The traits were selected for their perceived relevance to disturbance response generally, but also include a specific focus on domestic livestock grazing. The analysis is structured hierarchically to enable attributes to be analysed within major life forms. A different selection of traits is identified as being relevant to each major life form. Flexible adaptation in the use of the trait set is suggested as a way of comparing functional response to disturbance over a series of locations. For example, assemblages will vary in their representation of the major life forms, and it may be relevant to analyse traits within a subset of these life‐form groups. Because individual studies encompass a limited range of environmental variation, and local floras may be constrained by their evolutionary context, similar approaches need to be tested over a range of vegetation types and geographic situations. A significant advance in functional trait analysis could be achieved if individual studies provide explicit descriptions of their evolutionary and ecological context from a global perspective.",W1994296613,False,0.576629638671875

Yet, most protists in the photic zone engage in some degree of phagotrophy, and it has been suggested that trophic strategy is really a continuum between pure phototrophs (phytoplankton) and pure phagotrophs (unicellular zooplankton). Such a continuum of trophic strategies is well represented by trait-based modelling techniques. A key model ingredient is the size of individual cells, as size constrains affinities for nutrient uptake, photosynthesis and active encounter with other cells. We outline a general trait-based model of a unicellular planktonic organism where size is a central trait and where nutrient uptake, photosynthesis and phagotrophy are determined by investments into these functions and by the physical constraints imposed by organism size. This framework provides simple predictions of how trophic strategy correlates with size.",W1910670626,False,0.8889570832252502

The model can predict a counter-intuitive relationship previously suggested in the literature, where abundant viruses are associated with rare hosts and vice versa. The model explains the observed dominance of slow-growing prokaryotes as the result of successful defence strategies, rather than as dormancy of hosts lacking essential substrates. In addition to these important conceptual aspects, the model is able to reproduce realistic values for virus : host ratios and partitioning of bacterial production between predatory loss and viral lysis. A high COR is also shown to increase the community's richness and Shannon diversity index. This model thus not only couples life strategies at the cellular level with system properties, but it also links the two system level properties of biogeochemical flows and diversity to each other. The model operates with host groups, and consequences for biodiversity when interpreting these groups in terms of species and strains are discussed.",W1878708397,False,0.8695930242538452

https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.11.1.189,PREPARATION OF SINTERED PYREX GLASS AERATORS FOR USE IN WATER CULTURE EXPERIMENTS WITH PLANTS,"In growing plants under water culture conditions it is frequently important, and sometimes indispensable, to pass air under pressure through the solutions. Such aeration has a profound influence on root development. A practical problem arises of providing means for the uniform distribution of air through the culture solution, especially when tanks or other large containers are employed. In some experiments it is also necessary that the aeration devices shall not yield impurities to the solution ; for example, in the study of the effects of elements required by the plant in minute quantity. It has been found essential to the work of this laboratory to provide extensive facilities for aeration in the greenhouse. Several methods of distributing air were devised but were eliminated for various reasons. Among the devices used were surgical rubber tubing; porous porcelain, alundum, and block tin tubing; Folin tubes; and carborundum blocks. Surgical rubber tubing with a soft smooth wall, pierced with fine needle holes, aerated solutions fairly well, but was discarded because of its rapid deterioration, uneven aeration, and compositional impurities. Block tin tubing, drilled with small holes, was rejected because of uneven aeration and possible toxicity. The principal objections to alundum, porcelain, and carborundum were mechanical unsuitability and possible presence of impurities, both in the aerators and in the connections necessarily employed. Since inert, resistant units of uniform quality1 and capable of dispersing the air in fine bubbles were essential, pyrex glass was finally chosen as a suitable medium through which air could be distributed without encountering the objections mentioned. Glass aerators of the type needed were not obtainable on the market, and as methods described in the literature were not applicable to our requirements, it was necessary to develop one. Many modifications of sintered glass aerators were tried, such as sintered disks sealed into glass tubing of various sizes and shapes, and tubing constructed entirely of sintered glass. Individually these were satisfactory in operation, but could not be economically produced in large quantities and it was difficult to obtain even aeration throughout a group of aerators. The method finally devised incorporates the sintering and sealing in one operation. The resulting aerator is efficient, rapidly and easily made in large quantities, and readily cleaned.",W2051961863,False,0.1560482531785965

This study was conducted to determine the effect of N deficiency on N uptake and redistribution throughout plants during a 14‐d period of regrowth following cutting in ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Eight‐week‐old plants grown in hydroponic culture, were labeled for 5 d with 15 N prior to cutting treatment. Regrowth occurred during 14 d with a low or high N supply in the growth medium and 15 N amounts recovered in plants were used to estimate both N uptake from the medium and N remobilization from roots and stubble to regrowing leaves. Comparison of clipped plants regrowing under nonlimited and limited N conditions showed that N deficiency reduces the growth of leaves. Nitrogen starvation decreases N uptake from the medium and protein N remobilization of roots, while N remobilization from stubble remains unaffected. After 14 d on N‐starved medium, about 69% of N in new regrowing leaves was obtained from endogenous compounds accumulated in roots and stubble, while only 40% was remobilized from these tissues in plants grown on a nonlimited N medium. Consequently, there is an important deficit between net N outflow and net N inflow, particularly in stubble of N limited plants. The overall results demonstrated that stubble tissues contribute to remobilization of N compounds during regrowth after defoliation in proportion to the level of N deficiency in the medium, while remobilization of protein N of roots was decreased with a low supply of N in the medium.",W1994438872,False,0.7780665755271912

Hunter River) stubble leaves was found to be low (c. 55 ng CO2 cm-2 sec-1) immediately after removing shoots 15 cm above the stem base. However, within several days the NCE rose to a maximum of 130 ng CO2 cm-2 sec-1 on day 8. This peak rate was similar to that of recently expanded new leaves and held for about 3 days before declining. Leaves of similar age and position on uncut plants showed a steady decline in NCE. Leaf resistance, r'l, was low (c. 0.8 sec cm-1) and did not change as the NCE increased during the first 8 days. Mesophyll resistance, r'm, to carbon dioxide diffusion was initially high and declined from c. 9 to 2 sec cm-1 during this period. Comparison of dry weight changes of plant parts after stubble leaves were either retained or removed suggested that the tap-root benefited most by stubble leaf retention. The contribution to new shoots from stubble leaves appeared to be slight. However, when stubble leaves were exposed to 14CO2 on day 11, photosynthate was mainly exported into the shoot arising from the axil of the exposed leaf. This suggests that stubble leaves substitute, in part or completely, for the supply of carbohydrate to stubble shoots normally derived from reserves mobilized in the tap-root. The likely causes of rejuvenation in NCE of stubble leaves after partial shoot removal are discussed along with the significance of this photosynthetic contribution to regrowth of the lucerne plant.",W1965002881,False,0.8682300448417664

An aggregate risk study was used to evaluate the association between horses exposed to eitf and development of laminitis. Veterinary teaching hospitals participating in the Veterinary Medical Data Base were grouped by whether equine accessions were likely to have been at high, moderate, or low risk for exposure to eitf. From 1980-1990, there were 185,781 accessions, of which 5,536 had diagnosis of laminitis. Proportion of equine accessions with laminitis reported by veterinary teaching hospitals for high, moderate, and low risks, were 3.41, 3.04, and 2.00 cases/100 accessions, respectively ( P &lt; 0.0001). Comparison of the proportion of accessions with laminitis in the high- and moderate-risk groups with that in the low-risk group revealed significant differences between risk groups over all months ( P = 0.063) and differences from month to month within risk groups ( P = 0.0001). If the difference among risk groups is attributed entirely to exposure to eitf, the population-attributable risk is 7 cases/1,000 admissions, or 15% of all admissions for laminitis at veterinary teaching hospitals in our data base. Preliminary data support an association between horses exposed to eitf and increased risk of laminitis; however, studies at the individual animal level are indicated to confirm this hypothesis.",W1492108130,False,0.01622595265507698

The highest A. lolii concentrations were recorded in early summer, which coincided with the development of plant reproductive structures. Lolitrem B concentrations were highest from summer to early autumn and were consistently highest in the basal part of the plant. Peramine concentrations were generally highest in the upper part of the plant. Individual plants contained different levels of A. lolii, lolitrem B and peramine.

This method when used with automated HPLC equipment, permits analysis of 60 to 80 samples per day.

The laboratory experiments showed no strong preference for size of the artificial seeds in the range 3–8 mm (diameter). A mass of about 400 mg was selected when artificial seeds of 5‐5.5 mm were offered at different distances from the nest. In the field experiments, crushed seeds were placed 2 m from the nest and ants showed a clear preference for the size class 2.0–3.0 mm in diameter, which is much smaller and lighter than the preference for the artificial seeds. The preference of seeds from different plants showed very big variability. There was no correlation between the preference and any of the following variables of the seeds: fresh mass, dry mass, water content, energy content, and nitrogen content. No evidence for energy optimizing in food selection in Messor capitatus was found. The energetic reward of bringing any seed back to the nest will, under all normal conditions, be much higher than the energetic expenditure. For example, the energetic content in a wheat seed is about 650 Joule, which is sufficient energy for a worker ant of Messor capitatus to carry the seed for a distance of 6.5 km at a temperature of 30 o C.",W1979071921,False,0.8825405836105347

We found one insulin‐like peptide expressed at very high levels in queen but not worker larvae. Also, the gene for an insulin receptor was expressed at higher levels in queen larvae during the 2nd larval instar.

https://doi.org/10.2307/2257603,Termitaria and Vegetation Patterns on the Loita Plains of Kenya,"Air photographs of parts of East Africa characteristically show extensive areas where regular patterns produced by mound-building termites are prominent. Some of the patterns form a conspicuous feature of the landscape but others are difficult to distinguish. Distinctive vegetation zones occur on the mounds and often on the surrounding ground if it is affected by rain wash from the mounds. The vegetation patterns on the Loita plains of Kenya have frequently been seen from the air but not properly understood. It has long been known that termites can have a profound effect on vegetation and plant communities on termite mounds are often of distinct types. Thus Glover (1937) listed some of the plants found on old termitaria on the 'high-veld' of the Transvaal. It is known also that termite mounds occur in definite soil types; for example, Kemp (1955) mentions large mounds aggregated on grey soil around the margin of swampy ground in parts of eastern Tanganyika which were probably built by Odontotermes rectangularis. Murray (1938) demonstrated that termitaria in the Transvaal had a higher percentage of humus, nitrogen (about twice as much) and colloidal matter (about twice as much) than the surrounding soils. They also had a higher maximum water-retaining capacity but there was no significant difference between the pH of termitaria soil and that of the surrounding country. There was little difference in total water content or holard (Weaver & Clements 1938) in the two soils but the percentage of holard, humus, nitrogen, colloid and maximum water-retaining capacity rose towards the centre of the mounds. Murray concluded that, although the chemical content of termitaria was richer than that of the soil of the surrounding 'purple veld',* the fertile constituents appeared to be unavailable to plants as the living mounds in the studied areas were never covered with luxuriant vegetation. It is true that vegetation is often absent on living mounds but it has been observed that maize, sisal and other crops planted on old broken-up termitaria in cultivated land are greener and taller than elsewhere. We suggest, therefore, from personal observation, that it is not the chemical composition but the hardness and imperviousness of the soil which discourages plant growth on living termitaria, and that vegetation patterns around the mounds are influenced by the amount of clay and salts derived from the termitaria themselves. Glover (1949) observed that on the edges of 'dambos' (open seasonal swamps) in the Brachystegia woodland in the Abercorn district of Northern Rhodesia, the hard texture of the outer soil of termitaria in the early part of their existence inhibited plant growth. As they became older, the hard surface broke down and the mounds flattened out,",W2335724460,False,0.8974313139915466

Since lower level BD at genetic, individual, and population levels largely determines the functionality and resilience of natural populations and communities, individual level measures promise to link EC-induced physiological, ecological and evolutionary responses to EF. Intraspecific trait differences, while representing among the least understood aspects of natural microbial communities, have recently become easier to measure due to new technology. For example, recent advance in scanning flow-cytometry (SCF), automation of phytoplankton sampling and integration with environmental sensors allow to measure morphological and physiological traits of individual algae with high spatial and temporal resolution. Here we present emerging features of automated SFC data from natural phytoplankton communities and the opportunities that they provide for understanding the functioning of complex aquatic microbial communities. We highlight some current limitations and future needs, particularly focusing on the large amount of individual level data that, for the purpose of understanding the EC-BD-EF link, need to be translated into meaningful BD indices. We review the available functional diversity indices that, despite having been designed for mean trait values at the species level, can be adapted to individual-based trait data and provide links to ecological theory. We conclude that, considering some computational, mathematical and ecological issues, a set of multi-dimensional indices that address richness, evenness and divergence in overall community trait space represent the most promising BD metrics to study EC-BD-EF using individual level data.",W2017977033,False,0.8072880506515503

The morphology of the fescue isolates was compared with E. typhina isolated from bent grass (Agrostis perennans). In all isolates, conidia were identical and were typical of E. typhina. In fescue grasses the endophyte failed to produce stromata, but on bent grass the fungus seasonally produced stromata, typical of the genus. Cattle grazing the fescue grasses showed signs of the fescue toxicity syndrome, the E. typhina was found in frequencies of 100%; in grasses from pastures in which cattle showed no signs of the syndrome, frequencies were 0 to 50%. Nutritional factors in vitro were more complex for the isolates from fescue than for the isolate from bent grass. These studies suggested that E. typhina includes biotypes that might be involved in the toxicity syndrome. The fescue biotypes grew poorly on media, and yields were inadequate for toxicity studies. However, the bent grass isolate grew well on three media, and extracts from two of these were toxic to chicken embryos.

Many studies of community assembly focus on two mechanisms: environmental filtering and competitive interactions. This focus ignores the importance of other assembly processes such as equalizing fitness processes and facilitation. The contribution of different processes to community assembly can be elucidated by examining functional diversity patterns of traits that differ in their contribution to different assembly processes. 2. In alpine tundra, we explored trait patterns along a stress–resource gradient that varied in productivity, nitrogen availability and soil moisture. We explore whether functional diversity is low in abiotic stressful environments and increases in more benign environments as competition becomes more important, and if equalizing fitness processes and facilitation affect functional diversity. We calculated community‐weighted mean trait values and functional diversity for specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area, stomatal conductance, plant height and chlorophyll content as well as multivariate functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity. 3. At the community level, functional diversity increased at both ends of the gradient: high resource availability was associated with greater functional diversity in height and leaf area, and lower resource availability was associated with greater functional diversity in SLA, stomatal conductance, and chlorophyll content. As a result of this trade‐off in functional diversity among traits, multivariate functional diversity did not change across the gradient. Phylogenetic diversity increased with increasing resource availability. 4. We find evidence for at least three assembly processes along the gradient. Abiotic filtering by wind and cold exposure may reduce functional diversity in height and leaf area at the low resource end of the gradient. Also at low resource availability, increasing functional diversity in the other three traits suggests competition for below‐ground resources. At the resource‐rich end of the gradient, increased functional diversity in height and leaf area suggests increased competition for light or facilitation. 5. Synthesis : Our results suggest that multiple assembly processes (abiotic filtering, above‐ground competition, and below‐ground competition) operate simultaneously to structure plant communities along a stress–resource gradient. These processes would be obscured by a single multivariate trait index or phylogenetic diversity and are only evident by analysing functional diversity patterns of individual traits.",W1588034641,False,0.8384924530982971

However, aggregates are also sites of elevated heterotrophic activity, which may rather cause enhanced retention of aggregated material in the upper ocean. Small-scale biological-physical interactions govern the formation and fate of marine snow. Aggregates may form by physical coagulation: fluid motion causes collisions between small primary particles (e.g. phytoplankton) that may then stick together to form aggregates with enhanced sinking velocities. Bacteria may subsequently solubilise and remineralise aggregated particles. Because the solubilization rate exceeds the remineralization rate, organic solutes leak out of sinking aggregates. The leaking solutes spread by diffusion and advection and form a chemical trail in the wake of the sinking aggregate that may guide small zooplankters to the aggregate. Also, suspended bacteria may enjoy the elevated concentration of organic solutes in the plume. I explore these small-scale formation and degradation processes by means of models, experiments and field observations.

The main purpose of our study was to determine if SLA and/or LDMC could be used as indicators of plant resource-use strategy in sand dune environments. The selected species were mainly distributed in three types of sand dunes: mobile sand dune, semi-fixed sand dune, and fixed sand dune. The three differed in their soil nutrient content and vegetation productivity. Both SLA and LDMC varied substantially among species in the different dunes. Maximum SLA (28.2 m^2 kg^(-1)) was observed in the annual grass Setaria viridis in a fixed sand dune, and the lowest SLA (8.6 m^2 kg^(-1)) was found in the perennial grass Pennisetum centrasiatum in a semi-fixed sand dune. LDMC varied from 0.10 g g^(-1) for the annual forb Chenopodium glaucum in a fixed sand dune to 0.41 g g^(-1) for the perennial grass Phragmitis australis in a fixed sand dune. For species common to two or three sites, their SLA and LDMC were significantly different between sites (P＜0.05), except for two species for SLA and six species for LDMC. SLA and LDMC were negatively correlated both in the three types of sand dunes and for each functional type (annual versus perennial species). However, SLA and LDMC were significantly correlated only for the species in fixed sand dune, perennial species as well as all species. The results of our study showed that the SLA of annual plant species was generally higher than that of perennial species and that LDMC was significantly different between annual compared to perennial plants (P＜0.05).",W1497273946,False,0.8915923833847046

The temporal trends of annual ET ref during 1961–2006 calculated by Penman‐Monteith method were explored and the underlying causes for these trends were analysed in the Yellow River Basin (YRB). The contributions of key meteorological variables to the temporal trend of ET ref were detected using the detrended method and then sensitivity coefficients of ET ref to meteorological variables were determined. For ET ref, positive trends in the upper, middle and whole of YRB, and significant negative trend ( P = 0·05) in the lower basin were obtained by the linear fitted model. Significant increasing trend ( P = 0·05) in air temperature and decreasing trend in relative humidity were the main causes for the increasing trends of ET ref in the upper, middle and whole basins. For the whole basin, the increasing trend of ET ref was mainly caused by the significant increase ( P = 0·05) in air temperature and to a lesser extent by a decrease in the relative humidity, decreasing trends of R s and wind speed reduced ET ref. The spatial distribution of sensitivity coefficients addressed that the sensitive regions for ET ref response to the changes of the four meteorological variables are different in the YRB. The sensitive region lay in the upper basin for R s, the northwest portion of the middle basin for wind speed, the south portion of YRB for relative humidity and the west portion of the upper basin and the north portion of the middle basin for air temperature. In general, R s was the most sensitive variable for ET ref, followed by relative humidity, air temperature and wind speed in the basin scale.

The accessories are euchromatic but smaller than the A-chromosomes. They occur in 78% of the individuals sampled and are constant in number in all the cells of an individual. All the accessories are morphologically identical and in no cell has any association between the accessories and the A-chromosomes been observed. The accessory chromosomes behave normally at mitosis. During meiosis their behaviour differs from that of the A-chromosomes in that at metaphase I they are sometimes associated together to form accessory ‘bivalents’ or ‘multivalents’. At anaphase I the paired accessories segregate in the same way as the A-chromosomes. Unpaired accessories, however, do not divide and are generally incorporated in one of the daughter nuclei. At anaphase II the accessories divide and segregate regularly. There is a significant difference in the transmission of accessories through the male and female lines. The accessories are preferentially eliminated from the male line and retained in the female line. This provides a possible mechanism for their retention at a constant level and frequency in the population.",W1974501137,False,0.016917718574404716

Ecologists need a common language of plant traits in order to make comparisons across regions and scales, pool data, and maximize the utility of the data. To develop such a set of traits we began with the primary challenges faced by plants: dispersal, establishment, and persistence in order to identify fundamental traits. Most of these traits are hard to measure, but advances in comparative ecology have suggested a number of easy to measure analogs. Unfortunately, some of the fundamental traits have no simple analog. The common core list includes: seed mass, seed shape, dispersal mode, clonality, specific leaf area, leaf water content, height, above‐ground biomass, life history, onset of flowering, stem density, and resprouting ability. Most of the traits can be measured quantitatively, but several traits on the list must still be measured qualitatively due to logistical problems or lack of an easy analog. Key problem areas include: dispersal ability, capacity for vegetative spread, germination, palatability, plasticity, and all the various below‐ground traits. Comparative studies need to address these problem areas. The common core list is suggested as a common starting point for studies of functional ecology. The idiosyncrasies of regional floras and specific research agendas will dictate which traits can be ignored and those that need to be added.",W1996231206,False,0.7413120865821838

Increasing the CO 2 concentration increased the rate of dry matter production per unit leaf area (net assimilation rate or NAR) in soybean and velvetleaf but either decreased or did not alter NAR in corn and itchgrass. At 45 days after planting, the weed/crop ratios for total dry matter production for velvetleaf/corn and itchgrass/corn were significantly greater at both 600 and 1000 ppm than at 350 ppm CO 2. The weed/crop ratio for itchgrass/soybean was less at 1000 ppm than at 350 or 600 ppm CO 2. Compared to the value at 350 ppm, the weed/crop ratio for velvetleaf/soybean was greater at 600 ppm and less at 1000 ppm CO 2. We conclude that atmospheric CO 2 enrichment probably will make weeds with the C 3 photosynthetic pathway more competitive with crops having the C 4 pathway. Weeds with the C 4 pathway may become less competitive with crops having the C 3 pathway.",W1590867454,False,0.7434985637664795

This experiment was conducted to investigate certain physiological responses of N‐limited soybean [ Glycine max (L.) Merr. cv. Lee] plants growing in a CO 2 enriched environment and to examine their role in determining growth and yield. The nonnodulating soybean plants were grown to maturity in controlled environment chambers at 350 or 700 μL L −1 CO 2 and at 0.05, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, or 10.0 m M KNO − 3 supplied in nutrient solution. Substantial increases in whole‐plant growth and seed yield occurred in both CO 2 treatments with increasing nitrate levels; the increases were greater, however, at high CO 2. At all NO − 3 levels except the lowest, exposure to high CO 2 resulted in increased total leaf area, mean net assimilation rate, NO − 3 uptake, and N utilization efficiency. Increased NO − 3 uptake was associated with larger root systems, as uptake per unit of root mass was lower than controls. Carbon dioxide enrichment had little effect on dry matter partitioning among plant parts or harvest index. Alterations in partitioning were related to differences in NO − 3 supply. The results suggest that atmospheric CO 2 enrichment can stimulate seed yield of soybean even when the availability of N in the rhizosphere is limited.",W1963974935,False,0.7451189756393433

A global meta‐analysis of treeline response to climate warming,"Treelines are temperature sensitive transition zones that are expected to respond to climate warming by advancing beyond their current position. Response to climate warming over the last century, however, has been mixed, with some treelines showing evidence of recruitment at higher altitudes and/or latitudes (advance) whereas others reveal no marked change in the upper limit of tree establishment. To explore this variation, we analysed a global dataset of 166 sites for which treeline dynamics had been recorded since 1900 AD. Advance was recorded at 52% of sites with only 1% reporting treeline recession. Treelines that experienced strong winter warming were more likely to have advanced, and treelines with a diffuse form were more likely to have advanced than those with an abrupt or krummholz form. Diffuse treelines may be more responsive to warming because they are more strongly growth limited, whereas other treeline forms may be subject to additional constraints.",W2103818866,False,0.8662265539169312

In most cases, both sexes as well as important variants are depicted, all enlarged. In his Foreword to this revised edition, Professor Philip Corbet, Past-President of the Worldwide Dragonfly Association and doyen of British odonatists, states that, as a standard reference work, “it will continue to contribute importantly to the progress of odonatology.” The author has made a few corrections to his original text, which covered 114 species of Odonata breeding in Europe, and has added a new Preface and an updating Supplement. The Introduction, which is largely unchanged, includes chapters on History; Life History; the Adult Dragonfly; Distribution; Morphology of the Adult Dragonfly; a complete, updated Check List; and Keys to the suborders and families. The Systematic section gives keys to the genera and species, with clear descriptions and details of the biology, flight periods, and distribution of all species found in Europe, with distribution maps showing national boundaries. This is now followed by the Supplement, in which Dr Askew has added a further ten resident species, including one new to science, and several adventives. It also provides new information under the following headings: Nomenclature; Orthography; Thermoregulation; American species observed in Europe; Accidental Introductions into Europe; Other species newly recognized in Europe; Species new to the British Isles; Expansion of recorded ranges within Europe; Other new distribution records; and Contraction of recorded ranges. The author goes on to list major European and national literature on the Odonata published since 1988. There are numerous line-drawings throughout the text and over 100 new references to the European literature have been added to the supplement bringing the total to over 650. The book concludes with a new Index to English and scientific names, incorporating all species, subspecies and synonyms cited in the revised text. There are two plates of colour photographs showing biology and habitats and the author has added a further colour plate to his original 29 plates of adult insects, depicting five of the new European species and one from North America. In its new, slightly-reduced, softback format, this classic work, which has already sold 3000 copies, will be more practical in the field and should prove extremely popular with British and Continental odonatists.",W1555325693,False,0.04296332597732544

https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.01523,Phenological shifts and the fate of mutualisms,"Climate change is altering the timing of life history events in a wide array of species, many of which are involved in mutualistic interactions. Because many mutualisms can form only if partner species are able to locate each other in time, differential phenological shifts are likely to influence their strength, duration and outcome. At the extreme, climate change-driven shifts in phenology may result in phenological mismatch: the partial or complete loss of temporal overlap of mutualistic species. We have a growing understanding of how, when, and why phenological change can alter one type of mutualism-pollination. However, as we show here, there has been a surprising lack of attention to other types of mutualism. We generate a set of predictions about the characteristics that may predispose mutualisms in general to phenological mismatches. We focus not on the consequences of such mismatches but rather on the likelihood that mismatches will develop. We explore the influence of three key characteristics of mutualism: 1) intimacy, 2) seasonality and duration, and 3) obligacy and specificity. We predict that the following characteristics of mutualism may increase the likelihood of phenological mismatch: 1) a non-symbiotic life history in which co-dispersal is absent; 2) brief, seasonal interactions; and 3) facultative, generalized interactions. We then review the limited available data in light of our a priori predictions and point to mutualisms that are more and less likely to be at risk of becoming phenologically mismatched, emphasizing the need for research on mutualisms other than plant-pollinator interactions. Future studies should explicitly focus on mutualism characteristics to determine whether and how changing phenologies will affect mutualistic interactions.",W1966092338,False,0.6093782186508179

Such adaptations are particularly interesting in invasive alien species which have been present in an area for a relatively short time. There are few observations of latitudinal trends in alien plants, and no account exists for Impatiens glandulifera, a problematic annual weed in most countries of central and north‐western Europe. Here we describe variation in growth and phenology in 26 populations of this species from nine European regions in a common garden in Denmark. Above‐ground biomass (an estimate of fecundity), height and basal diameter were lower in the northern populations which were first to produce flowers. Some differences were also observed in biomass allocation to leaves, flowers and fruits, albeit without a latitudinal pattern. The latitudinal trends in growth and survival disappeared in a field experiment, probably due to suboptimal site conditions. Most variation in plant traits was explained by differences among regions with some minor effects of populations within regions. Besides latitude, no other geographical, climatic or population trait correlated with the observed differences in growth and phenology. Differences in latitude may mainly represent variation in length of the growing season. The causes and potential consequences of such latitudinal trends for population dynamics and dispersal of alien plants are discussed.",W1749007262,False,0.8872187733650208

Phenologies can evolve, but the role of evolution in the response of mutualisms to climate change is poorly understood. We developed a model that explicitly considers both the evolution and the population dynamics of a plant–pollinator mutualism under climate change. How the populations evolve, and thus whether the populations and the mutualism persist, depends not only on the rate of climate change but also on the densities and phenologies of other species in the community. Abundant alternative mutualist partners with broad temporal distributions can make a mutualism more robust to climate change, while abundant alternative partners with narrow temporal distributions can make a mutualism less robust. How community composition and the rate of climate change affect the persistence of mutualisms is mediated by two‐species Allee thresholds. Understanding these thresholds will help researchers to identify those mutualisms at highest risk owing to climate change.",W1505032151,False,0.8883347511291504
,Plant-pollinator interactions: from specialization to generalization.,"Just as flowering plants depend on their pollinators, many birds, insects, and bats rely on plants for energy and nutrients. This plant-pollinator relationship is essential to the survival of natural and agricultural ecosystems. Plant-Pollinator Interactions portrays the intimate relationships of pollination over time and space and reveals patterns of interactions from individual to community levels, showing how these patterns change at different spatial and temporal scales. Nickolas M. Waser and Jeff Ollerton bring together experts from around the world to offer a comprehensive analysis of pollination, including the history of thinking about specialization and generalization and a comparison of pollination to other mutualisms. An overview of current thinking and of future research priorities, Plant-Pollinator Interactions covers an important theme in evolutionary ecology with far-reaching applications in conservation and agriculture. This book will find an eager audience in specialists studying pollination and other mutualisms, as well as with biologists who are interested in ecological, evolutionary, and behavioral aspects of the specialization and generalization of species.",W1602204537,False,0.8124374747276306

To tackle this challenge, areas of conservation biology that are disparate ought to be integrated into a unified framework.

In many interactions complex, integrated defense mechanisms prevent infection and disease. These defensive systems include preformed physical and chemical barriers as well as inducible defenses such as the strengthening of cell walls or synthesis of antimicrobial compounds (i.e., phytoalexins) and proteins.1,2 In certain cases plants react to pathogen attack by developing long-lasting, broad-spectrum systemic resistance to later attacks by pathogens. This phenomenon, termed systemic acquired resistance (SAR), has been observed in many species and may be ubiquitous among higher plants. In the last five years progress has been made toward understanding the molecular basis of SAR. In this review we first provide a brief history of SAR research, then describe our present knowledge of the manifestation and induction of SAR.

The numbers of lesions which developed were directly proportional to the concentration of inoculum. At equal concentrations, conidia from young cultures produced more lesions than conidia from old cultures. Variation in lesion numbers between plants within a pot always considerably exceeded the variation between opposite half‐leaflets of a leaf, as did variation between pots and between leaves of old, but not of young plants. As the standard error of the number of lesions developing per half‐leaflet ( x ) increases as the mean increases, the values of x need to be transformed before being statistically analysed.

Confirmation of the zymogenic nature of the enzyme.,"Chitin synthetase was solubilized with digitonin from a particulate yeast fraction. The solubilized enzyme, which did not sediment at 200,000 X g and emerged after the void volume in a Sepharose 6B column, was active only after treatment with a protease. This confirms that chitin synthetase exists in the plasma membrane as a zymogen and that initiation of the chitin septum occurs by localized activation of the enzyme. By differential extraction with sodium cholate and digitonin, followed by chromatography on Sepharose 6B, a 20-fold purification of the enzyme was achieved with respect to the crude particles. The purified enzyme showed a requirement for a phospholipid; phosphatidylserine and lysophosphatidylserine were the best activators. Unsaturated fatty acids strongly inhibited synthetase activity, whereas their saturated counterparts were inert. The solubilized enzyme catalyzed the formation of insoluble chitin in the absence of added primer.

Adaptation of these reagents to calorimetric use may be accomplished by omission of the iodide and iodate in their preparation, since these interfere with the molybdate color reagents. This omission produces no especial change in the character of the reagents. KI, however, inhibits the autoreduction of the copper and in its absence an unstable reagent results. Nevertheless, if the copper is added to the rest of the reagent on the day of its use, this difficulty is avoided. When the Somogyi micro reagent (2) is used in this way with almost any of the various phosphomolybdate reagents, very satisfactory proportionality is found between color density and glucose taken over a wide range of values. However, all of the phosphomolybdate reagents tried left much to be desired in reproducibility from time to time and lacked the desired stability of color. We therefore tried various color reagents, which led to the development of a new arsenomolybdate reagent. When this reagent was used with Somogyi’s micro reagent, it gave satisfactory stability and reproducibility of color. By this means it has been possible to utilize the copper reagents in a photometric procedure for practically all the uses to which the titrimetric procedures are adapted. These include tissue sugar, glycogen, urine reduction equivalent, maltose, glucuronic acid, etc. However, diastase determinations have not been successful because of the effect of the undigested starch on the clarity of the final colored solution.

Unmethylated phi X174 replicative form DNA remains unmethylated after its introduction and integration into these cells. On the other hand, phi X174 replicative form DNA that was methylated in vitro at its C-C-G-G residues retains these methylations as shown by restriction enzyme analysis with Hpa II and Msp I to detect methylation at this specific site. Although these unselected methylated vectors are prone to lose 30-40% of their methyl moieties upon transfection, this demethylation appears to be random. Once established, the resulting methylation pattern is stable for at least 100 cell generations. In order to examine the specificity of methylation inheritance, fully hemimethylated duplex phi X174 DNA was synthesized in vitro from primed single-strand phi X174 DNA by using 5-methyl deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate. This molecule was inserted into mouse L cells by cotransformation and subsequently was analyzed by a series of restriction enzymes. Only methylations located at C-G residues were conserved after many generations of cell growth. The results suggest that the inheritance of the cellular DNA methylation pattern is based on a C-G-specific methylase that operates on newly replicated hemimethylated DNA.",W1966468838,False,0.0009416823741048574

Inhibition of virus replication in vivo and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions.,"We tested two biological properties of a continuously growing mouse cytotoxic T cell line, L4, which is specific for influenza A virus and has been cloned and recloned many times. We previously reported that L4 cells are H-2 restricted and cross-reactive for all type A influenza viruses, whereas they do not recognize type B influenza viruses. They bear Thy-1 and Lyt-2 markers. In the present study, we show that L4 cytotoxic T cells protect mice against a lethal influenza infection on transfer to syngeneic recipients, and reduce virus titers in the lungs of mice challenged with a heterologous type A influenza virus. This provides further support for the active role of cytotoxic T cells in limiting virus replication in influenza infection. We could also demonstrate that the cloned cytotoxic T cells induce a delayed-type hypersensitivity skin reaction in the footpads of mice challenged with live or inactivated influenza virus. This reaction can be observed at 24 h, but has declined by 48 h. A clone of cells derived from L4 that has lost its cytotoxic potential and its ability to recognize infected cells did not induce a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction in the presence of virus. Thus, cytotoxic T cells actively killing influenza virus-infected cells are able to induce a delayed-type hypersensitivity skin reaction to homologous and heterologous type A influenza viruses.",W1968800495,False,0.002154212212190032

https://doi.org/10.2307/1931991,The Effect of Temperature and Feeding on the Intrinsic Rate of Increase of Three Species of Hydra,"The use of the fresh water polyp, hydra, as an experimental animal in many facets of biological research has greatly increased since the difficulties of mass culturing were overcome by Loomis (1953) and Loomis and Lenhoff (1956). The continual proliferation of the cells of the adult hydra results partially in the formation of new individuals through asexual budding, rather than an increase in the size of the adult. In addition, cells are continually being lost from the tips of the tentacles and from the peduncle and, under certain conditions, through formation of gonads and the release of their products. For this reason, in part, hydra is considered to be an immortal animal (Brien 1953). The concern of this study is only with the reproductive potential resulting from asexual budding. Estimates of the reproductive potential of hydra are relatively scarce. Loomis's study (1954) on an estimate for Hydra Jittoralis has been a step in this direction. On the other hand, consideration of the variability of the rate of increase among individuals of the same species and between species is completely lacking. Loomis (1954) has shown that the rate of increase for H. littoralis is a function of the environment. His examination of several environmental factors (certain ions, oxygen tension, pH, temperature, and nutritional status) indicates some effect on this population parameter. However, the relative significance of each factor interacting with each of the others is not clear. The question also arises as to whether there is any inherent difference in the intrinsic rate of increase between species of hydra and whether this might be related in some way to their conditions of existence in nature. This study was designed to examine in detail the intrinsic rate of increase for 3 species of hydra under 2 temperatures and 2 states of nutrition and to assess the interactions between these factors.",W1969282584,False,0.7159302234649658

Although it is well established that JA controls the expression of a large set of target genes in response to tissue damage, very few gene products have been shown to play a direct role in reducing herbivore performance. To test the hypothesis that JA-inducible proteins (JIPs) thwart attack by disrupting digestive processes in the insect gut, we used a MS-based approach to identify host proteins that accumulate in the midgut of Manduca sexta larvae reared on tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) plants. We show that two JIPs, arginase and threonine deaminase (TD), act in the M. sexta midgut to catabolize the essential amino acids Arg and Thr, respectively. Transgenic plants that overexpress arginase were more resistant to M. sexta larvae, and this effect was correlated with reduced levels of midgut Arg. We present evidence indicating that the ability of TD to degrade Thr in the midgut is enhanced by herbivore-induced proteolytic removal of the enzyme's C-terminal regulatory domain, which confers negative feedback regulation by isoleucine in planta. Our results demonstrate that the JA signaling pathway strongly influences the midgut protein content of phytophagous insects and support the hypothesis that catabolism of amino acids in the insect digestive tract by host enzymes plays a role in plant protection against herbivores.",W1532348513,False,0.8849083185195923

Here, an inverse correlation of these stimulatory effects with the activities of several cell cycle-related genes is demonstrated. Concomitant with the induction of flavonoid biosynthetic enzymes in UV-irradiated cell suspension cultures of parsley (Petroselinum crispum), total histone synthesis declined to about half the initial rate. A subclass of the histone H3 gene family was selected to demonstrate the close correlation of its expression with cell division, both in intact plants and cultured cells. Using RNA-blot and run-on transcription assays, it was shown that one arbitrarily selected subclass of each of the histone H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 gene families and of the genes encoding a p34cdc2 protein kinase and a mitotic cyclin were transcriptionally repressed in UV-irradiated as well as fungal elicitor-treated parsley cells. The timing and extent of repression differed between the two stimuli; the response to light was more transient and smaller in magnitude. These differential responses to light and elicitor were inversely correlated with the induction of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, a key enzyme of phenylpropanoid metabolism. Essentially the same result was obtained with a defined oligopeptide elicitor, indicating that the same signaling pathway is responsible for defense-related gene activation and cell cycle-related gene repression. A temporary (UV light) or long-lasting (fungal elicitor) cessation of cell culture growth is most likely due to an arrest of cell division which may be a prerequisite for full commitment of the cells to transcriptional activation of full commitment of the cells to transcriptional activation of pathways involved in UV protection or pathogen defense.

We tested whether such a relationship also holds for growth rate and pathogen resistance. For 15 radish ( Raphanus sativus L.) cultivars, we determined the potential growth rate and the resistance to fungal wilt disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum. We subsequently aimed to explain a putative negative relationship between growth rate and resistance based on plant chemical composition. Both growth rate and resistance level varied greatly among cultivars. Moreover, there was a strong negative correlation between growth rate and resistance, i.e. there are costs associated with a high resistance level. Roots of slow‐growing, resistant cultivars have a higher biomass density. Using pyrolysis mass spectrometry. we part1y explained variation in both growth rate and resistance in terms of the same change in chemical composition. Leaves of slow‐growing, resistant cultivars contained more cell wall material. Surprisingly, roots of slow‐growing, highly resistant cultivars contained significantly less cell wall material, and more cytoplasmic elements (proteins). We speculate that this higher protein concentration is related to high construction and turn‐over costs and high metabolic activity. The latter in turn is thought to be responsible for a rapid and adequate resistance reaction, in which phenols may be involved.",W1965052072,False,0.452068030834198
https://doi.org/10.1111/bij.12146,Relatedness and resource diversity interact to influence the intensity of competition,"When resource competition occurs between close relatives, the negative effects of competition are potentially amplified. However, kin selection theory predicts that natural selection should promote the evolution of mechanisms that minimize the intensity of competition between kin. Experimental tests of these hypotheses are mixed, however. Moreover, there is little consensus regarding the generality of either outcome, suggesting that the conditions important in determining the effects of competition between kin are likely complex and not fully understood. We performed two experiments using spadefoot toad tadpoles (Spea multiplicata) to evaluate the hypothesis that individuals can minimize the negative effects of exploitative competition by using alternative resources when competing with close relatives. Supporting our hypothesis, we found that only when individuals had access to alternative resources were the negative effects of competition between siblings less than between unrelated competitors. We suggest that mechanisms to lessen kin competition may be more likely to evolve in environments where alternative resources are available, and that selection to minimize exploitative competition between kin may promote the evolution of resource polyphenism. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 110, 689–695.",W1521936673,False,0.8053587675094604

Theory predicts that divergence arises because natural selection favors individuals that are phenotypically dissimilar from their competitors. Yet, there are few conclusive tests of this key prediction. Drawing on data from both natural populations and a controlled experiment, this paper presents such a test in tadpoles of two species of spadefoot toads (Spea bombifrons and S. multiplicata). These two species show exaggerated divergence in trophic morphology where they are found together (mixed-species ponds) but not where each is found alone (pure-species ponds), suggesting that they have undergone ecological character displacement. Moreover, in pure-species ponds, both species exhibit resource polymorphism. Using body size as a proxy for fitness, we found that in pure-species ponds disruptive selection favors extreme trophic phenotypes in both species, suggesting that intraspecific competition for food promotes resource polymorphism. In mixed-species ponds, by contrast, we found that trophic morphology was subject to stabilizing selection in S. multiplicata and directional selection in S. bombifrons. A controlled experiment revealed that the more similar an S. multiplicata was to its S. bombifrons tankmate in resource use, the worse was its performance. These results indicate that S. multiplicata individuals that differ from S. bombifrons would be selectively favored in competition. Our data therefore demonstrate how resource competition between phenotypically similar individuals can drive divergence between them. Moreover, our results indicate that how competition contributes to such divergence may be influenced not only by the degree to which competitors overlap in resource use, but also by the abundance and quality of resources. Finally, our finding that competitively mediated disruptive selection may promote resource polymorphism has potentially important implications for understanding how populations evolve in response to heterospecific competitors. In particular, once a population evolves resource polymorphism, it may be more prone to undergo ecological character displacement.",W1957116440,False,0.8542453050613403

Evolutionary change can take many generations, which severely limits studies that examine the dynamics of diversification. Compounding this problem are limits to true replication in studies of extant diversity and an inability to examine directly the past selective conditions, both of which again result from the historical nature of evolution.

This book solves key problems that have impeded a definitive synthesis in the past. It uses new concepts and specific examples to show how to relate environmentally sensitive development to the genetic theory of adaptive evolution and to explain major patterns of change. In this book development includes not only embryology and the ontogeny of morphology, sometimes portrayed inadequately as governed by ""regulatory genes,"" but also behavioral development and physiological adaptation, where plasticity is mediated by genetically complex mechanisms like hormones and learning. The book shows how the universal qualities of phenotypes--modular organization and plasticity--facilitate both integration and change. Here you will learn why it is wrong to describe organisms as genetically programmed; why environmental induction is likely to be more important in evolution than random mutation; and why it is crucial to consider both selection and developmental mechanism in explanations of adaptive evolution. This book satisfies the need for a truly general book on development, plasticity and evolution that applies to living organisms in all of their life stages and environments. Using an immense compendium of examples on many kinds of organisms, from viruses and bacteria to higher plants and animals, it shows how the phenotype is reorganized during evolution to produce novelties, and how alternative phenotypes occupy a pivotal role as a phase of evolution that fosters diversification and speeds change. The arguments of this book call for a new view of the major themes of evolutionary biology, as shown in chapters on gradualism, homology, environmental induction, speciation, radiation, macroevolution, punctuation, and the maintenance of sex. No other treatment of development and evolution since Darwin's offers such a comprehensive and critical discussion of the relevant issues. Developmental Plasticity and Evolution is designed for biologists interested in the development and evolution of behavior, life-history patterns, ecology, physiology, morphology and speciation.

Better exploration of these processes is essential to understanding why exotic plants impact only certain systems, and why only some invaders have large impacts. Here, we review over 150 studies to evaluate the mechanisms underlying the impacts of exotic plant invasions on plant and animal community structure, nutrient cycling, hydrology and fire regimes. We find that, while numerous studies have examined the impacts of invasions on plant diversity and composition, less than 5% test whether these effects arise through competition, allelopathy, alteration of ecosystem variables or other processes. Nonetheless, competition was often hypothesized, and nearly all studies competing native and alien plants against each other found strong competitive effects of exotic species. In contrast to studies of the impacts on plant community structure and higher trophic levels, research examining impacts on nitrogen cycling, hydrology and fire regimes is generally highly mechanistic, often motivated by specific invader traits.

Second, studies of allozynies and mitochondrial DNA have clearly shown that fish and invertebrate species with planktotrophic larvae are genetically quite sindar over large regions, though not necessarily throughout their whole ranges. Genetic studies are, nevertheless, contributing new insights into the structure and biology of marine animal populations. One new insight is that sharp genetic subdivisions can occur in continuously distributed species, particularly those spanning biogeographic boundaries. An even more widespread observation is of very slight but significant microgeographic genetic heterogeneity embedded within broad regions of genetically very similar populations. Examples of the latter from the California Current are presented for the barnacle Balanirs glandula and the northern anchovy Engranlis rnovdax. Microgeographic heterogeneity holds interest for biological oceanographers and fisheries scientists because it contradicts the logic of population genetics as well as commonly held notions about the structure of zooplankton populations. Evidence suggests that genetic heterogeneity on nllcrogeographic scales results from temporal variation in the genetic composition of recruits. This temporal variation could be a consequence of either selection on larval populations or large variance in the reproductive success of individuals, owing to chance matching of reproductive activity with windows of oceanographic conditions conducive to fertilization, larval development, retention, and recruitment. In support of the latter hypothesis, effective sizes for natural oyster populations are estimated to be only small fractions of breeding population numbers. The temporal aspect of population genetic structure forges a strong interdisciplinary bridge to oceanographic research aimed at elucidating the temporally and spatially varying factors affecting recruitment.",W170321716,False,0.1864113211631775

https://doi.org/10.1029/91jc00980,Dynamics of the Coastal Transition Zone jet: 2. Nonlinear finite amplitude behavior,"The finite amplitude nonlinear behavior of the coastal transition zone (CTZ) jet, assumed to be governed by quasi‐geostrophic dynamics, is studied utilizing numerical experiments in an idealized geometry. Finite difference solutions to initial value problems are obtained for a stratified, six‐layer fluid in a periodic, flat bottom, ƒ plane channel. The initial flow field in all experiments includes a uniform along‐channel jet with horizontal and vertical structure obtained from CTZ hydrographic and current measurements made in May 1987. The maximum velocity in the jet is about 0.5 m s −1, the vertical shear is such that the velocities below 500 m depth are small, and the jet width is about 60 km. The Rossby radius for the first baroclinic mode is 24.6 km. An analysis of the linear stability of the jet flow field in part 1 shows that the jet is linearly unstable to disturbances with along‐jet wavelengths greater than 50 km. The largest growth rate is found for a wavelength around 260 km. The objectives here are to find the characteristics of the finite amplitude nonlinear jet instabilities and to examine local dynamical balances for signatures of instability processes that would help with the physical interpretation of results from limited‐area CTZ data assimilation models. Experiments are run with periodic channels of different length L ( x ), where the initial flow includes the basic jet and a small perturbation in the form of the most unstable linear mode for a wavelength equal L ( x ). In the basic experiment (BC) L ( x ) = 250 km. One experiment (LC) is run in a long channel L ( x ) = 1280 km with initial disturbances forced by application of a weak wind stress curl for three days. For times less than about 70 days, experiments BC and LC show the growth and development of finite amplitude meanders in the CTZ jet with spatial variations similar to those observed in spring 1987. During this early time period, the amplitudes of the meanders grow at rates of 1–4 km d −1, increasing with meander amplitude, and the meanders propagate in the direction of the jet upper layer flow at phase velocities of 5–3 km d −1, decreasing with meander amplitude. Initially, at small amplitudes the instability involves comparable contributions from barotropic and baroclinic processes in agreement with linear theory, but for large amplitude meanders the baroclinic energy conversion processes dominate. The vertical velocity field develops a characteristic spatial structure in relation to the jet meanders as do terms in the kinetic energy balance corresponding to the time rate of change of kinetic energy following fluid particles and to the rate of conversion from potential energy. The spatial structure of the latter field may provide a useful indication for jet baroclinic instability processes in limited‐area models. At later times in experiment BC (days 90–110), the meander growth is limited by a pinching‐off process that results in the formation of detached eddies on both sides of the jet. This process is characterized by a large relative increase of the kinetic energy in the lower layers and in the depth‐independent component of the flow. Experiments with L ( x ) = 180 and 150 km give qualitatively different behavior than that found in experiments BC and LC. The meander growth is bounded, and the jet flow field exhibits time‐dependent variations in the volume integrated kinetic and potential energies. For large time the flow may asymptotically approach a nearly steady state or states with irregular or nearly periodic oscillations in the integrated kinetic and potential energies.",W1980782618,False,0.3856910765171051

However, herbivore preference is determined not only by intrinsic plant attributes and herbivore biology but also by the environmental context. Within this framework, we aimed to analyse general interspecific trends in the association between herbivory and leaf traits over a wide range of angiosperms from central Argentina. We (i) tested for consistent associations between leaf traits, consumption in the field, and preference of generalist invertebrate herbivores in cafeteria experiments; (ii) assessed how well herbivore preferences in cafeterias matched leaf consumption in the field; and (iii) developed a simple conceptual model linking leaf traits, herbivore preference in cafeterias and consumption in the field. In general, we found that tender leaves with higher nutritional quality were preferred by herbivores, both in the field and in cafeteria experiments. According to our model, this relationship between field and cafeteria consumption and leaf quality is observed when generalist herbivores and plants of high accessibility are considered. However, differences between leaf consumption in the field and in cafeteria experiments can also be found. At least two reasons can account for this: (i) specialized plant–herbivore relationships often occur in the field, whereas cafeteria experiments tend to consider only one or a few generalist herbivores; (ii) different plant species growing in the field often differ in their degree of accessibility to herbivores, whereas in cafeteria experiments all species are equally accessible. Our results add new evidence to a growing consensus that, although herbivory in the field is determined by many factors, consistent patterns of differential susceptibility to foliar feeders can be found in leaves differing in nutritional quality and thus in resource‐use strategy.",W1546338757,False,0.8932146430015564

Young fungus cultures were harvested and incorporated into the fungus garden, and cultures of intermediate age were used to begin a new fungus garden; old cultures were simply harvested. To facilitate further research on this fungus, growth characteristics of the different isolates were studied under a variety of conditions. They grew better at 24°C than at 30°C, and growth did not occur at an incubation temperature of 37°C. In a broth culture medium, growth was enhanced by aeration of the culture and by addition of yeast extract, olive oil, sesame oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, cottonseed oil, walnut oil, safflower oil, or mineral oil. Glycerol did not noticeably affect growth, but Tween 80 inhibited growth.

Blackwell Science Ltd, Oxford.?60 (hardback), ISBN 0-632-05155-8;?25 (paperback), ISBN 0-632-05204-X. This book presents the invited papers from the British Ecological Society's 38th Symposium, of the same title, which was arranged jointly with the Netherlands Ecological Society and held at Wageningen Agricultural University in 1997. The stated aim of the book (and indeed the conference) was to ‘bring together authors from different disciplines…taking herbivores as the point of focus’, to give an ‘up-to-date overview of knowledge in the field and (to) suggest many interesting directions for future research’. The approach taken was to select five specific subjects for ‘comprehensive review’ within each of four Sections which cover ‘Plants shaping the evolution of insect herbivores’, ‘Herbivores and vegetation succession’, ‘Scaling up from food intake to community dynamics in vertebrate herbivores’ and the ‘Effect of higher trophic levels on plant–herbivore interactions’. Interestingly, all except two of the authors come from only four countries: the Netherlands, USA, Canada or UK. The first Section starts with an enthusiastic overview by the session organisers – an excellent way to begin and a flavour reflected by most of the papers in this Section. The first chapter gives a clear, well laid out discussion on the current state of insect/plant coevolution research. Chapters 2 and 4 present interesting and contrasting approaches to insect herbivore–host plant interactions. Insect resistance to plant allelochemicals and insecticides are discussed in Chapter 3, focusing on one important type of biochemical resistance (P450s). The Section ends with a thoughtful examination of the roles of both direct and indirect plant defence in plant–insect interactions. The first chapter of Section 2 presents some interesting ideas on herbivore–plant diversity relationships. This is followed by an informative review of the important and often under-rated impacts of below-ground herbivory on plant succession (Chapter 7). Chapter 8 presents a new model of plant–herbivore interactions along productivity gradients. Cyclic grazing and manipulation of the food resource by vertebrate herbivores are discussed in Chapter 9, and the final chapter gives an excellent, wide-ranging discussion of herbivores and trophic cascades. The third Section starts with a thorough review of digestive and ingestive adaptations to low-quality forage. Functional responses to resource complexity are the central issue discussed in Chapter 12. Chapters 13 and 14 present two quite different but equally illuminating model developments: the first synthesizing food intake and diet selection processes, scaling up from functional to numerical herbivore response; the second focusing on physiological flexibility and foraging behaviour in birds. The final chapter in this Section moves even further up the scale with a challenging paper on the complexity of vertebrate community dynamics. The final Section rounds the book off well, with four informative chapters adding valuable discussion to the debate on bottom-up or top-down forces in plant–herbivore systems. In Chapter 16, evolutionary and ecological consequences of plant–carnivore interactions are examined. Chapter 17 explores the importance of individual attributes in consumer–resource interactions. This is followed by a discussion of individual-based modelling as an integrative approach (Chapter 18). The Section (and book) finishes with predator control and trophic cascades, returning refreshingly to the importance of below-ground processes in plant–herbivore systems. The book is well produced, with a clear, albeit rather small, typeface and well reproduced tables and figures. However, the mixture of full justification (most) and left justification (numbered paragraphs, figure legends, references, etc.) gives parts of the book an untidy look. Most chapters are well referenced and there are useful author and subject indices at the end. Herbivory is a huge and ambitious topic to tackle so widely in just 19 conference papers, albeit restricting it to terrestrial ecosystems. But the choice and division of subtopics works well and the book certainly gives an interesting and state-of-the-art flavour of a wide range of subjects, albeit not a fully comprehensive overview. This is an extremely useful text for students and researchers at all levels. Inevitably, with such a wide coverage, this book is likely to be partially, rather than fully read by many users, especially those already well specialized. Unfortunately, most chapters (with the exception of those of the Editors!) do not really ‘emphasize the links between these different fields of interest’, as stated in the summary of the book. However, I would encourage all readers to at least dip into the other topics, as most chapters are very readable (so important, especially in an unfamiliar subject), interesting and informative.

Males exhibited sustained upwind flight resulting in source location only to intermediate blends and dosages. This optimal range of treatments appeared to be bounded by dosages too low or too high to result in significant attraction (net within‐plume displacement toward the source), the higher concentrations causing arrestment (no net within‐plume displacement) at some distance from the source. Similar results were obtained in field‐trapping studies with the same treatments, except that the optimal dosages were moved up about 10‐fold.

Movement of host odour was modelled in natural tsetse habitats with smoke and ultra‐light 7‐cm‐long wind vanes; the speed and direction of the air movements were analysed from video recordings thereof. Wind of &lt;1 ms ‐1 did not move in straight lines, since large packets of air (&gt;10 m across) often changed direction together. The rate of this change of direction (meander) correlated negatively with windspeed. In open woodland with a shrubby understorey (in which windspeed was reduced by a factor of &gt;5 from that above the canopy, to ax 0.3 m s ‐1 ), this wind meander fell by 2d̀ s ‐1 change of direction for each 0.1 m s ‐1 increase in windspeed (r 2 =0.96). Over open ground without shrub cover, the meander fell by 0.5d̀ s ‐1 per 0.1 m s ‐1 increase in windspeed (r 2 =0.85). In both situations, such meandering virtually ceased in winds of &gt; 1 m s ‐1. In woodland, the relationship between the direction of air movement near the surface of bare earth (one potential tsetse landing site) and that c. 0.5 m above ground level (flight height) was often weak (r 2 =0.2‐0.4), but this problem would be reduced if the fly averaged the ground‐level wind for at least 30 s. Odour (smoke) travelling from a source 15 m ‘upwind’ over open ground arrived at a notional tsetse fly for 80% of the time from a direction within 10d̀ of the true source direction. In typical tsetse woodland, however, the ‘odour’ arrived from all directions (including &gt;90d̀ away from the source), with only a 30% bias towards the true source direction (±10d̀). Evidently, tsetse must navigate up odour plumes by means that get round these difficulties‐simple, moth‐type upwind anemotaxis alone seems unlikely to be adequate.",W1982368180,False,0.6166935563087463

A cost-effective and reliable method is needed for monitoring this pest to correctly time insecticide applications. We studied the behavioral and antennal responses of adult A. musculus to its host plant volatiles to determine their potential for monitoring this pest. We evaluated A. musculus response to intact and damaged host plant parts, such as buds and flowers in Y-tube bioassays. We also collected and identified host plant volatiles from blueberry buds and open flowers and performed electroantennograms with identified compounds to determine the specific chemicals eliciting antennal responses. Male weevils were more attracted to blueberry flower buds and were repelled by conspecific-damaged buds compared with clean air. In contrast, females were more attracted to open flowers compared with flower buds. Nineteen volatiles were identified from blueberry buds; 10 of these were also emitted from blueberry flowers. Four of the volatiles emitted from both blueberry buds and flowers [hexanol, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, hexyl acetate, and (Z)-3-hexenyl butyrate] elicited strong antennal responses from A. musculus.

Additionally, afforestation planting programs frequently incorporate oak species. Artificial regeneration of oak stands is challenging for numerous reasons. In this article we synthesize the current state of knowledge regarding growing and planting the major oak species in the eastern United States, point out critical research gaps, and provide some general growing, planting, and stand tending guidelines and recommendations. Adequate site preparation, careful planting of healthy, genetically adapted seed or seedlings of high morphological and physiological quality, and subsequent control of competing vegetation and browse damage are necessary actions to assure regeneration success. Oak seedling survival in the early years after planting or seeding is a poor indicator of regeneration success. Successful regeneration may be defined as having a desired proportion of the oak planting stock reach dominant/codominant status in the stand. The costs of all activities required to produce a successful oak tree in the future stand should be considered in economic comparison of alternative prescriptions for oak regeneration.",W142287436,False,0.8945929408073425

(coléoptère, Curculionidae)","Malgre une litterature tres abondante sur la diapause celle qui se prolonge sur plusieurs annees a ete negligee. Notre objectif est d'etudier la dynamique des emergences du balanin de la chataigne curculio elephas et plus particulierement la diapause prolongee. Nos travaux ont notamment permis de preciser la periode et les mecanismes de levee de diapause chez le balanin. Les larves s'enterrent dans le sol entre octobre et novembre; la diapause est levee au cours du mois de decembre sans que les basses temperatures hivernales soient necessaires. Elle est suivie par une quiescence post-diapause qui se prolonge jusqu'en mars. Diapause et quiescence assurent la synchronisation du debut de la morphogenese dans la population. L'etalement des sorties de mi-aout a mi-septembre s'expliquerait essentiellement par des facteurs genetiques et par les conditions hydriques lors du developpement post-diapause et durant les emergences. En moyenne 40 a 50% des larves prolongent leur diapause sur plus d'une annee. Le choix de la duree de la diapause a lieu precocement: avant le mois de decembre; il dependrait notamment des conditions hydriques dans le sol en automne. Chez les insectes qui emergent apres un ou deux ans de vie souterraine, la fecondite et la longevite des femelles ne varient pas selon la duree de la diapause des larves. La variabilite pluriannuelle des emergences pourrait s'expliquer par une plasticite adaptative de type pile ou face (cooper et kaplan, 1982). Nos resultats empiriques et theoriques suggerent que la diapause prolongee est une reponse a l'imprevisibilite de plusieurs facteurs comme la secheresse estivale, la production en fruits et le ramassage des chataignes par l'homme. Une des consequences demographiques de la diapause prolongee est une relative stabilisation de l'effectif des populations de balanin. Ce resultat est a opposer a ceux obtenus par d'autres auteurs chez des especes dont la duree de la diapause est plus ou moins controlee par des facteurs predictifs (lies aux futures conditions de developpement et de reproduction). Nos travaux et plusieurs etudes recentes indiquent que la diapause prolongee n'est ni rare ni singuliere et que son interet evolutif ne peut plus etre sous-estime",W1585885365,False,0.38876479864120483

Details are given of the changes in gonad size in relation to the breeding cycle. L. argentatus on Skomer Island (Wales) nests in colonies mainly on the cliffs, fuscus has colonies on flat vegetated areas, whilst marinus is normally a solitary nester. In all three species the third egg of a clutch is usually much smaller than the other two. Weights of embryos of known age were collected and growth curves are given. The overall increase in weight from laying to hatching is 2·6 gm. per day for embryos of marinus and 2·0 gm. per day for those of argentatus. The rate of growth is not uniform, however, being greatest up to the 15th day. From 8 to 15 days the rate of growth for embryos is approximately 25% per day. Series of growth curves for young of each of the species were obtained. It appears that the number of chicks in a brood does not effect the rate of growth but rather the fledging weights, b/1 young weighing more than chicks from b/2 or b/3. Details are given of a pair of argentatus successfully fostering a strange chick, about 21 days old, when they had lost one of their brood of two. It was shown by experiments in gulls fostering young of other species that there is more than enough food available for maximum growth. In 220 argentatus nests followed from the laying of the first egg to hatching or failure, the average clutch size was 2·8 and average brood size 1·8. It is suggested that argentatus nearly always lays a c/3. c/2 is less successful than c/3 in hatching. The young of about 360 pairs of argentatus were followed as far as possible during development. About 30% fledged successfully giving 0·6 chicks per pair. 79 pairs of fuscus in an experimental area laid an average of 2·7 eggs per pair and hatched 1·8 young per pair. It was not possible to follow the fate of the chicks after hatching but the success rate seemed to be at least 50% of the chicks hatched. The causes of death in young gulls are listed and discussed. Predation and cannibalism are the main reasons for the loss of chicks of argentatus and fuscus on Skomer. Parasites, lack of food and disease are unimportant.",W1547822177,False,0.8563199043273926

(Coleoptera: Curculionidae) to a broad range of volatile plant compounds. The response profile is restricted to a small number of volatiles that evoke substantial EAGs. Large EAG responses were particularly found among green leaf volatiles (GLV) such as ( E )‐2‐hexenol‐1, ( Z )‐3‐hexenol‐1, hexanol‐1, hexanal, and heptanal. Other plant volatiles eliciting responses in the weevils' antenna are 2,5‐dimethylpyrazine, hexylamine, benzylalcohol, 1,2‐dimethoxybenzene, o ‐cresol, myrtenol, 3‐methylcyclohexanol, γ‐hexalactone, and γ‐heptalactone. EAG responses to terpenes were generally weak. Many of the monoterpenes are characteristic for the odour of conifers, a group of plants which tend to be avoided by adult vine weevils. The EAG response to several GLV and benzene derivatives in three geographically distinct populations of the vine weevil differed, suggesting between‐population variation in receptor sensitivities for several compounds under test. The GLV‐composition of the odour profile of potential food plants may be an important criterion for a polyphagous insect like the vine weevil to be used in host‐plant selection, since compounds in this odour group dominate so strongly the EAG response profile. In multiple food‐choice situations the weevils are known to prefer certain plant species and we hypothesize that they combine GLV information with that of more specific plant volatiles, thereby promoting attraction or avoidance.",W2003795072,False,0.7720922231674194

The trade-off hypothesis states that virulence is an unavoidable consequence of parasite transmission; however, since the 1990s, this hypothesis has been increasingly challenged. We discuss the history of the study of virulence evolution and the development of theories towards the trade-off hypothesis in order to illustrate the context of the debate. We investigate the arguments raised against the trade-off hypothesis and argue that trade-offs exist, but may not be of the simple form that is usually assumed, involving other mechanisms (and life-history traits) than those originally considered.

The aims of the present study were (i) to identify the quantitative variables that are most important in determining the differences in aggressiveness among groups of V. inaequalis isolates, and (ii) to ascertain whether virulent and avirulent isolates of V. inaequalis differ significantly in aggressiveness. The aggressiveness of eight isolates that differed in their virulence to the major resistance gene Rvi6 was compared on the non‐ Rvi6 apple cv. Gala. Three components of aggressiveness, namely lesion density, the number of spores per square centimetre of leaf area, and the number of spores per lesion, were evaluated 21 days after inoculation, and the kinetics of lesion density over time were analysed in terms of maximum lesion density, length of latent period and rate of lesion appearance. On the second youngest but fully developed leaf at the time of inoculation, maximum lesion density in the virulent group was 20% lower and the latent period 7% longer, than in the avirulent group. However, the alternative hypothesis, namely that isolates had adapted to quantitative resistance present in cv. Gala depending on their cultivar of origin, could not be rejected. The analysis of the kinetics of lesion density by a non‐linear mixed‐effect model proved useful in the assessment of aggressiveness.",W1588366483,False,0.8431009650230408

https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1999.0699,Selection for high and low virulence in the malaria parasite,"What stops parasites becoming ever more virulent? Conventional wisdom and most parasite–centred models of the evolution of virulence suppose that risk of host (and, hence, parasite) death imposes selection against more virulent strains. Here we selected for high and low virulence within each of two clones of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi on the basis of between–host differences in a surrogate measure of virulence—loss of live weight post–infection. Despite imposing strong selection for low virulence which mimicked 50–75% host mortality, the low virulence lines increased in virulence as much as the high virulence lines. Thus, artificial selection on between–host differences in virulence was unable to counteract natural selection for increased virulence caused by within–host selection processes. The parasite's asexual replication rate and number of sexual transmission forms also increased in all lines, consistent with evolutionary models explaining high virulence. An upper bound to virulence, though not the asexual replication rate, was apparent, but this bound was not imposed by host mortality. Thus, we found evidence of the factors assumed to drive evolution of increased virulence, but not those thought to counter this selection.",W123509089,False,0.6984915137290955

The factors influencing the rise and fall of plague epidemics remain obscure, but it is possible that severe epidemics may be preceded by subtle genetic changes in Y. pestis resulting in a highly virulent strain. A large-scale comparison of the new Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis sequences should allow the comparative evolution of Y. pestis to be investigated in great detail and key acquisitions and mutations to be identified. A striking feature of the Y. pestis CO92 genome sequence is the large number of insertion sequence (IS) elements. A total of 140 IS elements comprises 3.7% of the genome. Recombination between two IS100 elements is likely to be responsible for the extreme in vitro instability of the hms locus in Y. pestis. Several genetic mechanisms account for the accumulation of pseudogenes in Y. pestis, including IS element expansion, deletion, point mutation, and slippage in tracts of single-nucleotide repeats. When pathogenic Shigella strains arose from a nonpathogenic Escherichia coli ancestor, the loss of ompT and cadA genes (so-called black holes) may have contributed to their virulence and evolution.",W1527553456,False,0.0009739928063936532

The theory builds on the first principles of population ecology and genetics to explain how distance and area combine to regulate the balance between immigration and extinction in island populations. The authors then test the theory against data. The Theory of Island Biogeography was never intended as the last word on the subject. Instead, MacArthur and Wilson sought to stimulate new forms of theoretical and empirical studies, which will lead in turn to a stronger general theory. Even a third of a century since its publication, the book continues to serve that purpose well.

TICAM1 activates NF-kappaB through two different pathways involving its interactions with TNFR-associated factor 6 and receptor-interacting protein 1. It also activates IFN regulatory factor 3/7 through its interaction with TANK-binding kinase-1, leading to the robust up-regulation of IFN-beta. In this study, we describe the role of zebrafish (Danio rerio) TICAM1 in activating NF-kappaB and zebrafish type I IFN. Zebrafish IFN is unique in that it cannot be categorized as being alpha- or beta-like. Through comprehensive sequence, phylogenetic, and syntenic analyses, we fully describe the identification of a zebrafish TICAM1 ortholog. Zebrafish TICAM1 exhibits sequence divergence from its mammalian orthologs and our data demonstrate that these sequence differences have functional consequences. Zebrafish TICAM1 activates zebrafish IFN; however, it does so in an apparently IFN regulatory factor 3/7-independent manner. Furthermore, zebrafish TICAM1 does not interact with zebrafish TNFR-associated factor 6, thus NF-kappaB activation is dependent upon its interaction with receptor-interacting protein 1. Comparative genome analysis suggests that TICAM1 and TICAM2 evolved from a common vertebrate TICAM ancestor following a gene duplication event and that TICAM2 was lost in teleosts following the divergence of the rayfin and lobefin fishes 450 million years ago. These studies provide evidence, for the first time, of the evolving function of a vertebrate TLR pathway.",W1506240583,False,0.0030167996883392334

We investigated mechanisms causing predator–predator interference between fourth instar Hippodamia convergens larvae foraging for pea aphids on pea plants, Pisum sativum, with a wild‐type wax bloom, and the lack of such interference between larvae foraging on pea plants with a reduced‐wax bloom caused by the single gene mutation wel. 2. Observations showed that behavioural interactions between larvae were not affected by wax phenotype. Specifically, larvae did not encounter one another more frequently on normal‐wax peas as may have been predicted because reduced ability by coccinellids to attach to normal‐wax plant surfaces could restrict them to foraging on only some parts of these plants. 3. In a controlled bioassay on normal‐wax peas, H. convergens larvae avoided leaflets previously exposed to another larva. On reduced‐wax peas, this effect was not detected. 4. In microcosm experiments, inter‐predator interference in terms of prey consumption occurred on normal‐wax peas, but not on reduced‐wax peas. The interference on normal‐wax peas occurred whether two H. convergens larvae were placed on a pea aphid‐infested, normal‐wax plant simultaneously or sequentially. 5. We conclude that the observed inter‐predator interference is not as a result of direct physical contact, but rather arises because of (i) inhibition of foraging by chemical trails left by other larvae, (ii) the inability of larvae to access portions of the normal‐wax plants creating aphid refugia, or (iii) a combination of these factors.",W2004158949,False,0.8567414283752441

The parasitoid, Bracon mellitor, will probe with its ovipositor plant structures containing its host. The identification of methyl parahydroxy‐benzoate (methyl parasept), an antimicrobial additive to the semi‐synthetic diet used for rearing the host, as a releaser of this behaviour prompted an investigation of the parasitoid's response to this chemical. Its absence from field hosts suggested the response was learned. Female parasitoids reared in host‐infested cotton plant buds from the fields or in methyl parasept‐free hosts did not respond to methyl parasept alone until exposed to hosts contaminated with it. This is taken to imply associative learning by the females reared from the methyl parasept‐free hosts. A few responses to methyl parasept were elicited from inexperienced females reared from methyl parasept‐contaminated hosts, but their responsiveness increased after they had been exposed to methyl parasept‐contaminated hosts as oviposition stimuli. These results point to the caution that must be exercised in the isolation and identification of kairomones.",W1495845929,False,0.7594849467277527

A Challenge for Environmental Chemists,"The past 5 years have seen some major successes in terms of global measurement and regulation of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PB&T) chemicals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The Stockholm Convention, a global agreement on POPs, came into force in 2004. There has been a major expansion of measurements and risk assessments of new chemical contaminants in the global environment, particularly brominated diphenyl ethers and perfluorinated alkyl acids. However, the list of chemicals measured represents only a small fraction of the approximately 30,000 chemicals widely used in commerce (>1 t/y). The vast majority of existing and new chemical substances in commerce are not monitored in environmental media. Assessment and screening of thousands of existing chemicals in commerce in the United States, Europe, and Canada have yielded lists of potentially persistent and bioaccumulative chemicals. Here we review recent screening and categorization studies of chemicals in commerce and address the question of whether there is now sufficient information to permit a broader array of chemicals to be determined in environmental matrices. For example, Environment Canada's recent categorization of the Domestic (existing) Substances list, using a wide array of quantitative structure activity relationships for PB&T characteristics, has identified about 5.5% of 11,317 substances as meeting P & B criteria. Using data from the Environment Canada categorization, we have listed, for discussion purposes, 30 chemicals with high predicted bioconcentration and low rate of biodegradation and 28 with long range atmospheric transport potential based on predicted atmospheric oxidation half-lives >2 days and log air−water partition coefficients ≥5 and ≤1. These chemicals are a diverse group including halogenated organics, cyclic siloxanes, and substituted aromatics. Some of these chemicals and their transformation products may be candidates for future environmental monitoring. However, to improve these predictions data on emissions from end use are needed to refine environmental fate predictions, and analytical methods may need to be developed.",W1980094133,False,0.013661038130521774
https://doi.org/10.2307/2389364,Trade-Offs in Life-History Evolution,"Trade-offs represent the costs paid in the currency of fitness when a beneficial change in one trait is linked to a detrimental change in another. If there were no trade-offs, then selection would drive all traits correlated with fitness to limits imposed by history and design. However, we find that many life-history traits are maintained well within those limits. Therefore, trade-offs must exist. Trade-offs have played a central role in the development of life-history theory, from Gadgil & Bossert (1970), Charnov & Krebs (1973), Schaffer (1972, 1974a, b) and Bell (1980) on to the present. They have been measured through field observations (e.g. Clutton-Brock, Guinness & Albon, 1982, 1983), through experimental manipulations in laboratory (e.g. Partridge & Farquhar, 1981) and field (e.g. Askenmo, 1979), through -phenotypic correlations in the laboratory (e.g. Bell, 1984a, b) and through genetic correlations (e.g. Rose & Charlesworth, 1981a, b), to mention only a few of the more prominent studies. They have been reviewed by Stearns (1976, 1977), Bell (1980), Charlesworth (1980), Warner (1984), Reznick (1985), Partridge & Harvey (1985, 1988) and most thoroughly by Bell & Koufopanou (1986). In addition, the methods used to measure trade-offs have been the subject of criticism (Tuomi, Hakala & Haukioja, 1983; Partridge, 1987) and controversy (Reznick, Perry & Travis, 1986; Bell, 1986). The most prominent life-history trade-off involves the cost of reproduction. It has two major components, costs paid in survival and costs paid in future reproduction. Two approaches to analysing those costs were suggested by Williams: genetic costs represented by antagonistic pleiotropy (Williams, 1957) and phenotypic costs represented by negative correlations between current reproductive effort and future survival and reproduction (Williams, 1966a, b). A third, physiological approach to trade-offs has been developed by Hirshfield & Tinkle (1974) and Calow (1979), among many others (cf. Townsend & Calow, 1981). In this extensive discussion, a few points have not always received the attention they deserve: (1) That trade-offs can be measured and analysed at the level of the genotype, the phenotype and what lies between (intermediate structure) is well known and uncontroversial but it has not always been emphasized that each of those levels makes an essential contribution to our understanding. It is not a question of either genetic correlations or phenotypic correlations or physiological trade-offs but of how such measurements combine to deliver information about potential evolutionary responses. A study conducted at just one of these levels is likely to be of as little use as the information on the nature of the elephant delivered by one blind man holding its tail. (2) One can draw a useful distinction between intraindividual trade-offs for example, between the reproductive effort made by a female in one season and the probability that she will survive to the next season and intergenerational trade-offs for example, between a female's reproductive effort and the probability that her offspring will survive to the next season. Intraindividual tradeoffs (and only some of them) have received most attention but intergenerational trade-offs, which are arguably just as important, have been relatively ignored. They deserve more attention. (3) The genetic structure of a population, in particular the genetic variance-covariance matrix for a set of important life-history traits, reflects the very recent past, describes the present and predicts the near-term future. There is no logical or direct way to use the current genetic structure of a population to infer the trade-offs that constrained the past approach to the current state even if they occurred as recently as a few tens of generations ago (J. Travis, personal communication). (4) Our understanding of a trade-off can be described as first order (slope known), second order (curvature known) or third order (all details, including interaction effects, known). In a few cases we have reliable information about firstorder effects. In no case known to me do we have reliable information on second-order effects, which are important in the theory (e.g. Schaffer, 1974a). Measurement of third-order effects, however desirable (Pease & Bull, 1988), remains a matter for future research.",W1981286603,False,0.6892716288566589

Unfortunately, this interest is not matched by available knowledge. Physical science aspects of climate change--how much warmer, wetter, or drier, and how variable climate might be in different regions with different atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases--are uncertain and are likely to remain so for many years to come. And even if one posts particular climatic shifts, the ecological, social, economic, and other human consequences are elusive. These uncertainties pose sharp dilemmas for determining research priorities and for individual and social decision making. On what basis should society make decisions about the amounts and types of mitigation or adaptation efforts that should be undertaken. What values are put at risk by climate change. What kinds of uncertainties most cloud the picture. In particular, how significant are potential nonlinearities or surprises in physical or human effects.

https://doi.org/10.1175/jhm-d-13-0162.1,An Enhanced Model of Land Water and Energy for Global Hydrologic and Earth-System Studies,"Abstract LM3 is a new model of terrestrial water, energy, and carbon, intended for use in global hydrologic analyses and as a component of earth-system and physical-climate models. It is designed to improve upon the performance and to extend the scope of the predecessor Land Dynamics (LaD) and LM3V models by better quantifying the physical controls of climate and biogeochemistry and by relating more directly to components of the global water system that touch human concerns. LM3 includes multilayer representations of temperature, liquid water content, and ice content of both snowpack and macroporous soil–bedrock; topography-based description of saturated area and groundwater discharge; and transport of runoff to the ocean via a global river and lake network. Sensible heat transport by water mass is accounted throughout for a complete energy balance. Carbon and vegetation dynamics and biophysics are represented as in LM3V. In numerical experiments, LM3 avoids some of the limitations of the LaD model and provides qualitatively (though not always quantitatively) reasonable estimates, from a global perspective, of observed spatial and/or temporal variations of vegetation density, albedo, streamflow, water-table depth, permafrost, and lake levels. Amplitude and phase of annual cycle of total water storage are simulated well. Realism of modeled lake levels varies widely. The water table tends to be consistently too shallow in humid regions. Biophysical properties have an artificial stepwise spatial structure, and equilibrium vegetation is sensitive to initial conditions. Explicit resolution of thick (&gt;100 m) unsaturated zones and permafrost is possible, but only at the cost of long (≫300 yr) model spinup times.",W1975106412,False,0.531588077545166

https://doi.org/10.1029/tr038i002p00222,Moisture movement in porous materials under temperature gradients,"A theory of moisture movement in porous, materials under temperature gradients is developed which explains apparently discordant experimental information, including (a) the large value of the apparent vapor transfer, (b) effect of moisture content on net moisture transfer, and (c) the transfer of latent heat by distillation. The previous simple theory of water vapor diffusion in porous media under temperature gradients neglected the interaction of vapor, liquid and solid phases, and the difference between average temperature gradient in the air‐filled pores and in the soil as a whole. With these factors taken into account, an (admittedly approximate) analysis is developed which predicts orders of magnitude and general behavior in satisfactory agreement with the experimental facts. An important implication of the present approach is that experimental methods used to distinguish between liquid and vapor transfer have not done so, since what has been supposed to be vapor transfer has actually been series‐parallel flow through liquid ‘islands’ located in a vapor continuum. Equations describing moisture and heat transfer in porous materials under combined moisture and temperature gradients are developed. Four moisture‐dependent diffusivities arising in this connection are discussed briefly.",W1982448001,False,0.0625629723072052

All models qualitatively reproduce the global pattern of annual storage amplitude, and the seasonal cycle of global average storage is reproduced well, consistent with earlier studies. However, global average agreements mask systematic model biases in low latitudes. Seasonal extrema of low‐latitude, hemispheric storage generally occur too early in the models, and model‐specific errors in amplitude of the low‐latitude annual variations are substantial. These errors are potentially explicable in terms of neglected or suboptimally parameterized water stores in the land models and precipitation biases in the climate models.",W1479948234,False,0.05858459323644638

Combined, they comprise 354 values of K eff, and have been used to derive over 13 regression equation and predicting K eff vs density. Due to large (and largely undocumented) differences in measurement methods and accuracy, sample temperature and snow type, it is not possible to know what part of the variability in this data set is the result of snow microstructure. We present a new data set containing 488 measurements for which the temperature, type and measurement accuracy are known. A quadratic equation, where ρ is in g cm −3, and K eff is in W m −1 K −1, can be fit to the new data ( R 2 = 0.79). A logarithmic expression, can also be used. The first regression is better when estimating values beyond the limits of the data; the second when estimating values for low-density snow. Within the data set, snow types resulting from kinetic growth show density-independent behavior. Rounded-grain and wind-blown snow show strong density dependence. The new data set has a higher mean value of density but a lower mean value of thermal conductivity than the old set. This shift is attributed to differences in snow types and sample temperatures in the sets. Using both data sets, we show that there are well-defined limits to the geometric configurations that natural seasonal snow can take.",W1556099805,False,0.04569955915212631

This increase in self‐pollination often produces inbreeding depression. Thus, a dilemma may exist in that individuals cannot increase seed production without lowering the average fitness of each seed. Conditions necessary for the existence of the dilemma were confirmed in large individuals of the herbaceous perennial Geranium caespitosum. Manually geitonogamously pollinated flowers initiated as many fruits as manually outcrossed flowers, but showed a subsequently greater number of embryo abortions, matured fewer seeds, and had a lower average seed weight. Observations of pollinators and dye transfer showed that geitonogamous bee pollinations increased as the number of flowers per plant increased. A simple model predicted that detrimental effects from geitonogamy become likely when 55 flowers are simultaneously blooming. Plants with 55 or more flowers produced 30% of the flowers in populations.

https://doi.org/10.1121/1.384812,"Ears adapted for the detection of motion, or how echolocating bats have exploited the capacities of the mammalian auditory system","Bats use the rich food resources of the night by specializing in audition. They emit short echolocation sounds and listen to the echoes returning from potential prey. The bat’s auditory system analyzes spectral and temporal parameters of echoes for detecting, locating, and identifying a target. Different bat species have solved the problem of acoustic target detection and pattern recognition even in clustered situations by focusing on certain acoustical features of a target. The specialized motion detection by horseshoe bats, for instance, analyzes small echofrequency shifts modulated onto a long constant frequency echolocation signal. These frequency modulations are Doppler shifts within echoes returning from wing beating insects. For detecting modulations as small as 10 Hz or 0.01%, horseshoe bats have in the cochlea an extremely narrow filter (Q?500) matched to the carrier frequency (i.e., echolocation sound) of 83 kHz. The filter is realized by structural differentiations of the basilar membrane and the filter frequencies are represented on the basilar membrane in an expanded fashion. We have called this specialized patch of the basilar membrane an ’’acoustical fovea.’’ The ’’foveal frequencies’’ are largely overrepresented in the tonopical arrangement of the ascending auditory pathway. The bats have developed a feedback system which lowers the emitted frequency during flight in such a way that the Doppler shifted echofrequency is kept precisely at a fixed reference frequency of the fovea. This feedback system and other neuronal data disclose an intricate coupling of the auditory and vocalizing system. The evolution of echolocation in bats has driven the analyzing capacities of audition in both frequency and time domain close to theoretical limits. Investigations of such specialized systems give fascinating insights into capacities and possible general principles of auditory information processing.",W2086255537,False,0.021006403490900993

https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01294.x,Alpha and beta diversity of arthropods and plants in organically and conventionally managed wheat fields,"Summary Most studies in applied ecology use measures of α‐diversity measures, i.e. the mean diversity on a site, to compare biodiversity effects of different management schemes. The total or α‐diversity within a region, however, need not be correlated with the mean α‐diversity within any site of the region. Thus, analyses of α‐diversity alone may misrepresent the contributions of other diversity components (β) to total diversity (γ). We apply a biodiversity‐partitioning approach to species richness from a comparison between paired organic and conventional wheat fields in 21 sites from three regions in Germany, where we recorded plants, bees, carabids, staphylinids and spiders in the centre and edge of the fields. Relative values of α‐ and β‐diversity depended on taxon. Both between‐site and between‐region β‐diversity were very high (in total 60–85%). α‐Diversity and between‐site β‐diversity was larger on the edge than in the centre of fields for all taxa. α‐Diversity, between‐site β‐diversity of plants and bees and between‐region β‐diversity of bees were higher in organic than in conventional fields, providing local as well as larger‐scale species richness benefits. α‐Diversity did not differ between management types for the epigaeic arthropods. Lower between‐site β‐diversity was found for spiders in organic fields than in conventional fields, resulting in higher total species richness in conventionally managed wheat. Similarity in composition of landscapes surrounding the study fields was correlated with similarity in species composition for epigaeic arthropods in conventional fields. For this group of organisms the variability of landscapes in the sample contributed to increasing β‐diversity. Synthesis and applications. β‐Diversity accounts for the major part of species richness in agro‐ecosystems. Implementing an agri‐environment scheme such as organic agriculture may result in either an additional increase of total diversity, as could be shown for plants and bees, or in a decrease in total diversity as was the case for the spiders.

,"Soil, biomass, and management of semi-natural vegetation","Using a wide range of conditions and plant community types, species diversity was investigated in relation to edaphic and non-edaphic site conditions, management, and biomass characteristics. Both standing biomass and aboveground production were investigated, and their effects compared. Three taxonomic assemblages were studied: (1) vascular plants only, (2) bryophytes also included, (3) terrestrial lichens included as well. Using a multivariate approach, both species richness and evenness could best be explained when only vascular plants were considered, emphasizing the role of taxonomic restrictions. The models best explaining species richness merely required abiotic conditions. This supports recent theories emphasizing the importance of an environmental regulation of the pool of (adapted) species from which the actual species are recruited. Explanatory soil properties were moisture and pH (both unimodal), and the soil available N:P ratio. Plots with large perimeter:area ratios had significantly more species than those with low ratios, indicating the importance of consistency in quadrat shape. Hump-shaped species richness relationships could be identified for both standing biomass and productivity, but they explained only a small part of the variation and were apparent only if soil and management effects were not accounted for. Unimodality (and notably the decreasing phase) was most pronounced when using maximum standing biomass, suggesting that the key factor is competition for light. At intermediate levels of standing biomass, the positive effects of habitat productivity and the negative effects of standing biomass itself are in balance, and high species numbers may be expected. When soil or management variables were allowed in the models, humpshaped biomass relationships were no longer confirmed, suggesting that such relationships may arise from the covariation of biomass with other factors. Management explained a much larger part of the variation than the hump-shaped biomass relationship, suggesting that mowing and hay removal (both showing independent positive effects) regulate species richness in ways other than solely through the control of maximum standing biomass. Significantly higher evenness values were obtained at sites with low maximum biomass values, but only for the vascular plants. In addition, species evenness was positively related to the frequency of mowing. The numbers of both rare and endangered species were strongly curtailed by high standing biomass values, suggesting that these species are more susceptible to competitive exclusion than others. Through direct as well as indirect effects, management is confirmed to be beneficial not only for general species richness, but also for the occurrence of rare and endangered species.",W1575617545,False,0.8997380137443542

Such an ability implies that animals have reliable information about the risk of predation at a given place and time. Chemosensory cues are an important source of such information. They reliably reveal the presence of predators (or their presence in the immediate past) and may also provide information on predator activity level and diet. In certain circumstances (e.g., in the dark, for animals in hiding) they may be the only cues available. Although a vast literature exists on the responses of prey to predator chemosensory cues (or odours), these studies are widely scattered, from marine biology to biological control, and not well known or appreciated by behavioural ecologists. In this paper, we provide an exhaustive review of this literature, primarily in tabular form. We highlight some of the more representative examples in the text, and discuss some ecological and evolutionary aspects of the use of chemosensory information for prey decision making. Curiously, only one example illustrates the ability of birds to detect predator odours and we have found no examples for terrestrial insects, suggesting a fruitful area for future study.",W126353083,False,0.04974322393536568

The sources of chemicals to which prey species respond often originate as cues released by the predator (reviewed by Kats and Dill, this issue). Alternatively, cues may be released by other prey animals when they detect or are attacked by a predator. Such cues, known as chemical alarm signals, are particularly common in aquatic systems. These signals provide the basis of our current review. Short-term behavioural responses of prey animals to alarm signals have received the most attention. Behavioural responses of prey resemble those exhibited to known predators, and are therefore likely to make receivers less vulnerable to predation. More recently, studies have shown that benefits to alarm signal receivers extend beyond the immediate behavioural response of nearby conspecifics over a few minutes. For example, alarm signals are important in mediating the learning of unknown predators and dangerous habitats. Furthermore, alarm signals have been implicated in induced morphological defences, and defences that involve shifts in life history characteristics. In some systems, predators may have ways to counteract alarm signals used by their prey. We suggest that researchers must consider alarm signalling and associated learning phenomena when formulating hypotheses and designing future experiments.",W116851021,False,0.8622108697891235

We analysed the effect of several variables on the morphology of the rotifer Keratella tropica with the aim of accounting for its morphological variability in nature. We used field data from (i) an extensive survey of Argentine lakes, (ii) a 1.5 yr, monthly sampling of Salto Grande Reservoir, and (iii) a 3‐month, outdoor experiment in fish culture tanks. In addition, we performed a series of laboratory experiments aimed at isolating the effects of different variables. 2. The increase in crustacean biomass and the amelioration of their nutritional status (measured as the reciprocal of the starvation time) caused spine enlargement. In contrast, the presence of decomposers caused reduction of the spines. These results support the idea that a major proportion of the phenotypic expression of K. tropica depends on the concentration of an inducing factor, which in turn depends on the balance between release and decomposition rates of the chemical. 3. Food concentration was identified as a secondary factor affecting morphology. In agreement with records for other rotifers, food concentration and spine length were inversely related. Both factors, crustacean chemicals and food availability, seemed to act independently, at different developmental stages. Our experiments suggest, however, that the most exuberant individuals can only be induced through chemicals released by predators and competitors. 4. The presence of backswimmers (Notonectidae) resulted in individuals with very short or non‐existing posterior spines. Filtrates of backswimmer‐conditioned medium also produced a significant, although less striking, spine inhibition. Thus, different chemical factors seem to have opposite effects on K. tropica morphology. Those released by crustaceans induce spine elongation, while those released by backswimmers inhibit spine development. 5. Genetic differences were also identified as a source of morphological variability. Under identical laboratory conditions, different clones had spines of different length. Our experiments also suggest an inverse relationship between spine length and growth rate. The latter result, however, is based upon only three clones of K. tropica and is thus preliminary.",W1484542650,False,0.8378787636756897

Silver staining, OsO 4 staining, PAS staining, cholinesterase reaction and fluorescence for catecholamine‐containing nerves were used. The nervus terminalis forms on the medial side of the olfactory bulb a ganglionated plexus, from which branches are given off which course peripherally with the vomeronasal nerves. From a dorsal part of the terminalis nerve plexus an anterior branch is given off which runs along the anterior ethmoidal nerve to the nasal vestibule where it connects with a group of ganglia. The peripheral branches of the nerve run from here along two epithelial cristae formed histologically like dermal papillae. Ventrally in the respiratory region at the junction of the nasal cavity and the nasopharynx is a 1 × 2 mm area with olfactory epithelium, glands of Bowman and an independent innervation from the olfactory bulb. This is the so‐called septal olfactory organ. Trigeminal nerves form a plexus in the respiratory region and in the vestibule, but do not supply the olfactory region. Catecholamine‐containing and cholinesterase‐positive nerves run along the meningeal arteries on the cribriform plate and accompany their branches to the vascular plexus in the olfactory and respiratory regions. Double innervation is found not only of this vascular plexus but of the venous sinuses in the swell bodies of the vestibule.

However, their usefulness in conservation planning and policy is controversial because they are difficult to validate across time and space. Here we capitalize on small mammal surveys repeated over a century in Yosemite National Park, USA, to assess accuracy of model predictions. Historical (1900–1940) climate, vegetation, and species occurrence data were used to develop single‐ and multi‐species multivariate adaptive regression spline distribution models for three species of chipmunk. Models were projected onto the current (1980–2007) environmental surface and then tested against modern field resurveys of each species. We evaluated models both within and between time periods and found that even with the inclusion of biotic predictors, climate alone is the dominant predictor explaining the distribution of the study species within a time period. However, climate was not consistently an adequate predictor of the distributional change observed in all three species across time. For two of the three species, climate alone or climate and vegetation models showed good predictive performance across time. The stability of the distribution from the past to present observed in the third species, however, was not predicted by our modeling approach. Our results demonstrate that correlative distribution models are useful in understanding species' potential responses to environmental change, but also show how changes in species‐environment correlations through time can limit the predictive performance of models.",W1697990593,False,0.6571150422096252
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1466-822x.2004.00090.x,Bioclimate envelope models: what they detect and what they hide,"In a recent issue of Global Ecology and Biogeography, Pearson & Dawson (2003) provided an informative review of the use of bioclimate envelope models (BEM) for predicting future distributional ranges of temperate plant species under expected global climate change. The authors discuss several criticisms of the BEM approach and they conclude that these need not be a major drawback when applied as a starting point for predicting the impacts of potential climate change on species ranges. Here, I argue that the strongly deterministic and reductionist BEM rely on biological assumptions that are much more commonly violated in nature than Pearson & Dawson (2003) assume. Moreover, the statistical methods currently used for model validation overestimate model fits as a result of pseudoreplication. Both features make BEM prone to produce artificially optimistic scenarios of future climate change impacts on plant distributions. Little doubt exists that climate determines the large-scale distributions of many temperate plant species (Woodward, 1987). However, ongoing range shifts are affected by a multitude of other constraints and processes acting on population performance (e.g. Ibrahim et al., 1996; Clark et al., 2001; Travis, 2003). These differ greatly across species' ranges from their expanding to their eroding margins, and so also does the character of the respective populations (Lesica & Allendorf, 1995; Davis & Shaw, 2001). This will most probably result in geographically differential responses to changing environmental conditions, a point largely ignored by BEM approaches. In the following, I will comment on three major biological critiques of BEM that have been reviewed and downplayed by Pearson & Dawson (2003). BEM treat species as if they were acting independently of their biotic environment, thus neglecting potential effects of predation, competition or mutualisms on range dynamics. Pearson & Dawson (2003) argue accordingly that interactions between species may shape their spatial distributions on fine geographical scales, but are of minor importance at coarse scales, which are the main focus of BEM. However biotic interactions, not climate, are commonly considered the principal determinants of low-latitude range limits (Brown et al., 1996). Moreover, ecological research on biological invasions (unintended 'large-scale experiments') has broadly documented that biotic interactions affect species' performance throughout their established ranges. The release of invaders from their specialist antagonists in invaded areas underpins improved performances as compared with populations within the original range, and thus constitutes a key factor promoting the invasion process (Keane & Crawley, 2002). Range dynamics themselves are likewise affected by biotic interactions, since the absence of competitors allows pioneer populations at advancing range margins to reproduce and expand exponentially, whereas populations entering already occupied areas can only reproduce logistically and advance much slower (Ibrahim et al., 1996). Finally, many plant species rely on animals for seed dispersal and could not shift their ranges without them. Although seed dispersal mutualisms are typically not species-specific, some dispersers have probably contributed to shape major Holocene range expansions, such as the extirpated passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) in the case of North American nut-producing trees (Webb, 1986). These four examples illustrate that diverse biotic interactions may indeed influence species' range dynamics over coarse geographical scales. BEM treat individual species as evolutionarily homogeneous and unchangeable entities across their range, arguing that the tolerance range of a species evolves too slowly to affect range shifts occurring over a few decades. Rapid in situ adaptations in response to climate change appear indeed to be a rare phenomenon, as Pearson & Dawson (2003) underline. However, the existing adaptation of populations to local environmental conditions and the resulting geographical mosaic of adaptive genetic variation challenge the BEM approach much more (Jansson & Dynesius, 2002; see also Davis & Shaw, 2001). Rear edge populations are adapted to perform in environments that are often only marginally suitable for populations from other parts of the range, while high-latitude populations tend to be vagile generalists (Jansson & Dynesius, 2002; see Hampe & Bairlein, 2000; Santamaría et al., 2003; and references therein for case studies). BEM that simply project the climatic tolerance of current rear edge populations to construct future low-latitude range limits assume inherently that these will be formed by descendants of populations from the current range periphery. This would require that peripheral populations migrate fast enough to match climate change while outcompeting previously existing conspecifics on the migration route and conserving their genetic makeup sufficiently unchanged that they maintain their previous climate tolerance. This is obviously far from realistic. It appears more likely instead that most rear edge populations will go extinct, the overall climatic tolerance of species will therefore decline and their ranges will shrink more towards higher latitudes or altitudes than predicted by BEM. BEM ignore completely that a limited dispersal capacity may constrain future migrations of species, whereas ample ecological and phylogeographical research has underlined its key role for population and range dynamics (Cain et al., 2000; Clark et al., 2001; Jansson & Dynesius, 2002; Hampe et al., 2003). Again, a clear difference exists between populations at expanding and at retreating range margins. In the first case, changing climate increases both population fecundity and the availability of suitable establishment sites across the landscape. Both factors contribute significantly to reduce dispersal limitation. In contrast, populations at rear edges undergo successive fecundity declines, and they become highly isolated within a matrix of unsuitable habitats, so colonization events and any latitudinal migration are extremely unlikely. Phylogeographical studies show that many glacial refugia separated by only a few hundred kilometres have experienced no tangible gene flow over multiple glacial cycles, although the climatic conditions were often more favourable for population expansions and interchanges than today (Hampe et al., 2003; Petit et al., 2003). Moreover, many extant temperate European plant species have recovered their current distribution ranges from only some of their glacial refugia, while others did not contribute to the recolonization due to geographical dispersal barriers (Hewitt, 2000). Numerous species have expanded much more slowly than their climatic requirements would have allowed them or did not arrive to expand at all into formerly glaciated areas during the Holocene, yet they had been present there during previous interglacial periods (Huntley, 1990; Hewitt, 2000). In conclusion, past range shifts were less deterministic and predictable than current distribution ranges — formed after a period of relative climate stability — may suggest. Pearson & Dawson (2003) see the realism of BEM corroborated, because these tend to detect a high concordance between simulated and real species distributions. However, present-day ranges have developed under conditions different from those that species will presumably have to face during the coming decades. For instance, both the speed of anticipated climate change and the level of habitat fragmentation are unprecedented, and their interaction severely threatens population survival and mobility (Davis & Shaw, 2001; Hannah et al., 2002; Travis, 2003). It is doubtful to what degree past range shifts can serve to allow inference of future shifts: high model fits with current ranges do not guarantee high model realism. Moreover, the statistical methods used to date for model validation systematically overestimate the fit achieved by BEM because spatial autocorrelation exists when a given value of a variable at a given point can be predicted from its values at other points of known position. It is an inherent feature of species' distributions across spatial scales (Koenig, 1999; Legendre et al., 2002), and climate is likewise autocorrelated over distances of up to thousands of km (Koenig, 2002). Spatially autocorrelated data are not mutually independent, and statistics that ignore this fact produce inflated type I errors as a result of pseudoreplication (Legendre et al., 2002). This means, in the present case, that model fits increase systematically with increasing size and continuity of species' ranges: they are statistically biased. Various statistical treatments have been developed to deal with spatially autocorrelated data (Koenig, 1999; Keitt et al., 2002; Perry et al., 2002), and these need to be incorporated into BEM validations. Anthropogenic climate change is a major threat for the maintenance of biological diversity during the coming decades, and modelling is a crucial tool for evaluating its impact. Pearson & Dawson (2003) suggest using BEM as a first approximation, but the multiple drawbacks of this approach are likely to produce more 'wildly incorrect' predictions than Pearson & Dawson (2003) assume. Midgley et al. (2002) provide an illustrative example of how missing criticial detail within BEM may lead to overly optimistic predictions about the maintenance of species and within-species genetic diversity in a biodiversity hotspot. The study demonstrates that future conservation strategies require models that incorporate more detail and attain greater biological realism than BEM can (so far) provide (Hannah et al., 2002).

Their performance is invariably evaluated from the percentage success at predicting occurrence at test locations. Using logistic regression with real data from 34 families of aquatic invertebrates in 180 Himalayan streams, we illustrate how this widespread measure of predictive accuracy is affected systematically by the prevalence (i.e. the frequency of occurrence) of the target organism. Many evaluations of presence–absence models by ecologists are inherently misleading. With the same invertebrate models, we examined alternative performance measures used in remote sensing and medical diagnostics. We particularly explored receiver‐operating characteristic (ROC) plots, from which were derived (i) the area under each curve (AUC), considered an effective indicator of model performance independent of the threshold probability at which the presence of the target organism is accepted, and (ii) optimized probability thresholds that maximize the percentage of true absences and presences that are correctly identified. We also evaluated Cohen's kappa, a measure of the proportion of all possible cases of presence or absence that are predicted correctly after accounting for chance effects. AUC measures from ROC plots were independent of prevalence, but highly significantly correlated with the much more easily computed kappa. Moreover, when applied in predictive mode to test data, models with thresholds optimized by ROC erroneously overestimated true occurrence among scarcer organisms, often those of greatest conservation interest. We advocate caution in using ROC methods to optimize thresholds required for real prediction. Our strongest recommendation is that ecologists reduce their reliance on prediction success as a performance measure in presence–absence modelling. Cohen's kappa provides a simple, effective, standardized and appropriate statistic for evaluating or comparing presence–absence models, even those based on different statistical algorithms. None of the performance measures we examined tests the statistical significance of predictive accuracy, and we identify this as a priority area for research and development.",W1552647955,False,0.44095879793167114

https://doi.org/10.1002/env.514,Large scale wildlife monitoring studies: statistical methods for design and analysis,"Abstract Techniques for estimation of absolute abundance of wildlife populations have received a lot of attention in recent years. The statistical research has been focused on intensive small‐scale studies. Recently, however, wildlife biologists have desired to study populations of animals at very large scales for monitoring purposes. Population indices are widely used in these extensive monitoring programs because they are inexpensive compared to estimates of absolute abundance. A crucial underlying assumption is that the population index ( C ) is directly proportional to the population density ( D ). The proportionality constant, β, is simply the probability of ‘detection’ for animals in the survey. As spatial and temporal comparisons of indices are crucial, it is necessary to also assume that the probability of detection is constant over space and time. Biologists intuitively recognize this when they design rigid protocols for the studies where the indices are collected. Unfortunately, however, in many field studies the assumption is clearly invalid. We believe that the estimation of detection probability should be built into the monitoring design through a double sampling approach. A large sample of points provides an abundance index, and a smaller sub‐sample of the same points is used to estimate detection probability. There is an important need for statistical research on the design and analysis of these complex studies. Some basic concepts based on actual avian, amphibian, and fish monitoring studies are presented in this article. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",W1982512880,False,0.8186967372894287

A specific application is to examine successions in semi‐natural vegetation in north‐east Scotland. Questions related to these data include: Do transition probabilities of a pixel depend on the size of a patch of vegetation (polygon) and pixel location within the polygon? Do stable areas remain stable? Does the proximity of certain vegetation types influence transitions? We selected spatial variables that were likely to be important in this application, where short‐range vegetative spread was thought to be an important factor. The multinomial logit model is used to estimate the transition probabilities as a function of explanatory variables, including location, neighbourhood information and other factors recorded at the start of the transition period. This model allowed the testing of different assumptions about the dynamics of underlying processes leading to transitions. When the number of categories, for example vegetation types, observed is large in comparison to the sample size, estimates of transition probabilities can be unreliable. We show that using change of category within the time period as the response in a logistic regression can still provide insight to the underlying dynamics of change in such a case. The methods are illustrated with some Scottish vegetation classification data with pixels of size 5 × 5 m covering a square of area 0·25 km 2. Two contrasting squares were investigated: the first was upland moorland grazed by sheep and the second was a lowland area with more varied vegetation and low intensity grazing by cattle. In both squares there are strong spatial trends, and the neighbourhood of a pixel affected its transition. Prediction misclassification rates estimated from different models were compared using K‐fold cross‐validation. The multinomial model, including position in the square and number of neighbouring pixels in the same category as the pixel modelled, reduced the misclassification rate compared with the model without spatial explanatory variables. The improved estimates of transition probabilities could be incorporated into Markov models used in simulation studies to predict future vegetation changes under different management strategies.",W1517763382,False,0.833360493183136
https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1999.0856,Spatially autocorrelated disturbances and patterns in population synchrony,"Spatially synchronous population dynamics have been documented in many taxa. The prevailing view is that the most plausible candidates to explain this pattern are extrinsic disturbances (the Moran effect) and dispersal. In most cases disentangling these factors is difficult. Theoretical studies have shown that dispersal between subpopulations is more likely to produce a negative relationship between population synchrony and distance between the patches than perturbations. As analyses of empirical data frequently show this negative relationship between the level of synchrony and distance between populations, this has emphasized the importance of dispersal as a synchronizing agent. However, several weather patterns show spatial autocorrelation, which could potentially produce patterns in population synchrony similar to those caused by dispersal. By using spatially extended versions of several population dynamic models, we show that this is indeed the case. Our results show that, especially when both factors (spatially autocorrelated perturbations and distance–dependent dispersal) act together, there may exist groups of local populations in synchrony together but fluctuating asynchronously with some other groups of local populations. We also show, by analysing 56 long–term population data sets, that patterns of population synchrony similar to those found in our simulations are found in natural populations as well. This finding highlights the subtlety in the interactions of dispersal and noise in organizing spatial patterns in population fluctuations.",W1968245439,False,0.8389342427253723

,"Mourning Dove Breeding Population Status, 2001","This report includes Mourning Dove Call-count Survey information gathered over the last 36 years within the conterminous United States. Trends were calculated for the most recent 2and 10-year intervals and for the entire 36-year period. Between 2000 and 2001, the average number of doves heard per route decreased significantly in the Eastern and Central Management Units. No change was detected for the Western Unit. Over the most recent 10 and 36-year periods, significant declines were indicated for doves heard in the Central and Western Units. Additionally, in the Eastern Management Unit, a significant decline was detected over the most recent 10 years while there was no trend indicated over 36 years. In contrast, for doves seen over the 10-year period, a significant increase was found in the Eastern Unit while no trends were found in the Central and Western Unit. Over the 36-year period, no trend was found for doves seen in the Eastern and Central Units while a decline was indicated for the Western Unit. The mourning dove (Zenaida macroura) is a migratory bird, thus, authority and responsibility for its management is vested in the Secretary of the Interior. This responsibility is conferred by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, which, as amended, implements migratory bird treaties between the United States and other countries. Mourning doves are included in the treaties with Great Britain (for Canada) and Mexico. These treaties recognize sport hunting as a legitimate use of a renewable migratory bird resource. As one of the most abundant species in both urban and rural areas of North America, it is familiar to millions of people. Maintenance of mourning dove populations in a healthy, productive state is a primary management goal. To this end, management of doves includes assessment of population status, regulation of harvest, and habitat management. Call-count surveys are conducted annually in the 48 conterminous states by state and federal biologists to monitor mourning dove populations. The resulting information on status and trends is used by wildlife administrators in setting annual hunting regulations. DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE Mourning doves breed from the southern portions of Canada throughout the United States into Mexico, Bermuda, the Bahamas and Greater Antilles, and scattered locations in Central America (Fig. 1). Although some mourning doves winter throughout most of the breeding range, except for central Canada and the north-central U.S., the majority migrate south, wintering in the southern United States and south throughout most of Mexico and Central America to western Panama (Aldrich 1993, Mirarchi and Baskett 1994). The mourning dove is one of the most widely distributed and abundant birds in North America (Peterjohn et al. 1994, Fig. 1). Although not known precisely, the fall population has been estimated to be about 475 million (Dunks et al. 1982, Tomlinson et al. 1988). However, as there is evidence of population decreases since this estimate was made from data collected in the 1970's, we believe that the mourning dove population has declined to slightly more than 400 million in the United States. The primary purpose of this report is to facilitate the prompt distribution of timely information. Results are preliminary and may change with the inclusion of additional data. Artist Nancy Howe, Nancy Howe Studio, East Dorset, Vermont, provided the cover art for this report. Fig. 1. Breeding and wintering ranges of the mourning dove (adapted from Mirarchi and Baskett 1994). POPULATION MONITORING The Mourning Dove Call-count Survey was developed to provide an annual index to population size (Dolton 1993). This survey is based on work by McClure (1939) in Iowa. Field studies demonstrated the feasibility of the survey as a method for detecting annual changes in mourning dove breeding populations (Foote and Peters 1952). In the United States, the survey currently includes more than 1,000 randomly selected routes, stratified by physiographic region. In Canada, 20 randomly selected routes are located in parklands and prairie. The total number of doves heard on each route is used to determine trends in populations and provides the basis for determining an index to population size during the breeding season. Indices for doves seen are also presented in this report, but only as supplemental information for comparison with indices of doves heard. Even though both the numbers of doves heard and seen are counted during the survey, they are recorded separately. Within the United States, there are 3 zones that contain mourning dove populations that are largely independent of each other (Kiel 1959). These zones encompass the principal breeding, migration, and U.S. wintering areas for each population. As suggested by Kiel (1959), these 3 areas were established as separate management units in 1960 (Kiel 1961). Since that time, management decisions have been made within the boundaries of the Eastern (EMU), Central (CMU), and Western (WMU) Management Units (Fig. 2). The EMU was further divided into 2 groups of states for analyses. States permitting dove hunting were combined into one group and those prohibiting dove hunting into another. Additionally, some states were grouped to increase sample sizes. Maryland and Delaware were combined; Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island were combined to form a New England group. Due to its small size, Rhode Island, which is a hunting state, was included in this nonhunting group of states for analysis.",W1554693900,False,0.8972967863082886

However, most estimates of density‐dependent effects use the number of breeding pairs per unit area in a given season and look for correlations across seasons, a technique that assigns the same density score to each breeding pair, irrespective of local spatial variation. In this study, we employed GIS techniques to estimate individual breeding densities for great tits breeding in Wytham Woods UK, between 1965 and 1996. We then used linear mixed modelling to analyse the effect of density on reproductive processes. The areas of Thiessen polygons formed around occupied nestboxes were used to approximate territory size (necessarily inverse of breeding density). There were significant, independent and positive relationships between clutch size, fledging mass and the number of offspring recruited to the population, and territory size (all P &lt; 0·001), but no effect of territory size on lay‐date or egg mass. Thiessen polygons are contiguous and cover all of the available area. Therefore, at low nest densities territory polygons were excessively oversized. Using a novel procedure to address this limitation, territory sizes were systematically capped through a range of maxima, with the greatest effect in the models when territories were capped at 0·9–2·3 ha. This figure approximates to the maximum effective territory size in our population and is in close agreement with several field‐based studies. This capping refinement also revealed a significant negative relationship between lay‐date and territory size capped at 0·9 ha ( P &lt; 0·001). These density‐dependent effects were also detected when analyses were restricted to changes within individual females, suggesting that density effects do not merely result from either increased proportions of low‐quality individuals, or increased occupation of poor sites, when population density is high. Overall, these results suggest that, in the current population, great tits with territories smaller than c. 2 ha independently lay smaller and later clutches, have lighter fledglings, and recruit fewer offspring to the breeding population. These analyses thus suggest a pervasive and causal role of local population density in explaining individual reproductive processes.",W1520161019,False,0.8787516951560974

They have adapted to highly diverse habitats in the sea and fresh waters of the world and display great phenotypic variability. Some fish groups have gone through extremely rapid local radiations with clear connections to ecological factors. Such extensive radiations are, for example, seen in various groups of cichlids in the African rift lakes (e.g., Echelle and Kornfield 1984; Meyer 1993; van Alphen et al. in Chapter 8). Radiations in those vast lakes have been termed intralacustrine, which emphasizes that the relevant speciation events in the monophyletic species flocks are not necessarily sympatric (Smith and Todd 1984; Meyer 1993). A convincing case for sympatric speciation is seen in studies of cichlids in Cameroon crater lakes (Schliewen et al. 1994). In many cases, the evolution of diversity is seen to occur within populations of what are still considered single species, in which so-called varieties or morphs have emerged as a result of adapting to different habitats and food resources (e.g., Robinson and Wilson 1994; Skúlason and Smith 1995; Smith and Skúlason 1996). From a purely ecological perspective, these phenomena can be viewed as resource polymorphisms (Skúlason and Smith 1995). From an evolutionary perspective, they can be seen as multiple instances of incipient speciation. Thus, resource polymorphisms provide important opportunities to study the role of ecological factors in the evolution of new species (Schluter 1996b, 1998, 2001).",W1412044468,False,0.7362968325614929

However, if there is population structure and the sample is drawn from a single subpopulation, these two estimates of θ behave differently. The expected number of alleles in a sample is an increasing function of the migration rates, whereas the expected average number of nucleotide differences is shown to be independent of the migration rates and equal to 4N Tµ for a general model of population structure which includes both the island model and the circular stepping-stone model. This contrast in the behavior of these two estimates of θ is used as the basis of a test for population subdivision. Using a Monte-Carlo simulation developed so that independent samples from a single subpopulation could be obtained quickly, this test is shown to be a useful method to determine if there is population subdivision.",W1909602324,False,0.7886691689491272

The method provides an estimate of Nm, where N is the size of each local population in an island model and m is the migration rate. This method depends on knowing the phylogeny of the nonrecombining segments of DNA that are sampled. Given the phylogeny, the geographic location from which each sample is drawn is treated as multistate character with one state for each geographic location. A parsimony criterion applied to the evolution of this character on the phylogeny provides the minimum number of migration events consistent with the phylogeny. Extensive simulations show that the distribution of this minimum number is a simple function of Nm. Assuming the phylogeny is accurately estimated, this method provides an estimate of Nm that is as nearly as accurate as estimates obtained using FST and other statistics when Nm is moderate.

It provides a statistical framework for synthesizing and comparing the results of studies which have all tested a particular hypothesis. Meta‐analysis has the potential to be particularly useful for ecologists and evolutionary biologists, as individual experiments often rely on small sample sizes due to the constraints of time and manpower, and therefore have low statistical power. 2. The rewards of conducting a meta‐analysis can be significant. It can be the basis of a systematic review of a topic that provides a powerful exploration of key hypotheses or theoretical assumptions, thereby influencing the future development of a field of research. Alternatively, for the applied scientist, it can provide robust answers to questions of ecological, medical or economic significance. However, planning and conducting a meta‐analysis can be a daunting prospect and the analysis itself is invariably demanding and labour intensive. Errors or omissions made at the planning stage can create weeks of extra work. 3. While a range of useful resources is available to help the budding meta‐analyst on his or her way, much of the key information and explanation is spread across different articles and textbooks. In order to help the reader use the available information as efficiently as possible (and so avoid making time‐consuming errors) this article aims to provide a ‘road map’ to the existing literature. It provides a brief guide to planning, organizing and implementing a meta‐analysis which focuses more on logic and implementation than on maths; it is intended to be a first port of call for those interested in the topic and should be used in conjunction with the more detailed books and articles referenced. In the main, references are cited and discussed with an emphasis on useful reading order rather than a chronological history of meta‐analysis and its uses. 4. No prior knowledge of meta‐analysis is assumed in the current article, though it is assumed that the reader is familiar with anova and regression‐type statistical models.",W1490968191,False,0.7866398096084595

This requires a development of mathematical models that are sufficiently simple to be examined and capture, at the same time, the complex behavior of real social groups, where opinions and actions related to them may form clusters of different size. One such model, proposed by Friedkin and Johnsen, extends the idea of conventional consensus algorithm (also referred to as the iterative opinion pooling) to take into account the actors' prejudices, caused by some exogenous factors and leading to disagreement in the final opinions. In this paper, we offer a novel multidimensional extension, describing the evolution of the agents' opinions on several topics. Unlike the existing models, these topics are interdependent, and hence the opinions being formed on these topics are also mutually dependent. We rigorously examine stability properties of the proposed model, in particular, convergence of the agents' opinions. Although our model assumes synchronous communication among the agents, we show that the same final opinions may be reached ""on average"" via asynchronous gossip-based protocols.",W1020659046,False,0.14479400217533112
https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2288-6-50,Development and validation of MIX: comprehensive free software for meta-analysis of causal research data,"Meta-analysis has become a well-known method for synthesis of quantitative data from previously conducted research in applied health sciences. So far, meta-analysis has been particularly useful in evaluating and comparing therapies and in assessing causes of disease. Consequently, the number of software packages that can perform meta-analysis has increased over the years. Unfortunately, it can take a substantial amount of time to get acquainted with some of these programs and most contain little or no interactive educational material. We set out to create and validate an easy-to-use and comprehensive meta-analysis package that would be simple enough programming-wise to remain available as a free download. We specifically aimed at students and researchers who are new to meta-analysis, with important parts of the development oriented towards creating internal interactive tutoring tools and designing features that would facilitate usage of the software as a companion to existing books on meta-analysis. We took an unconventional approach and created a program that uses Excel as a calculation and programming platform. The main programming language was Visual Basic, as implemented in Visual Basic 6 and Visual Basic for Applications in Excel 2000 and higher. The development took approximately two years and resulted in the 'MIX' program, which can be downloaded from the program's website free of charge. Next, we set out to validate the MIX output with two major software packages as reference standards, namely STATA (metan, metabias, and metatrim) and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 2. Eight meta-analyses that had been published in major journals were used as data sources. All numerical and graphical results from analyses with MIX were identical to their counterparts in STATA and CMA. The MIX program distinguishes itself from most other programs by the extensive graphical output, the click-and-go (Excel) interface, and the educational features. The MIX program is a valid tool for performing meta-analysis and may be particularly useful in educational environments.

Linear regression models are an important statistical tool in evolutionary and ecological studies. Unfortunately, these models often yield some uninterpretable estimates and hypothesis tests, especially when models contain interactions or polynomial terms. Furthermore, the standard errors for treatment groups, although often of interest for including in a publication, are not directly available in a standard linear model. 2. Centring and standardization of input variables are simple means to improve the interpretability of regression coefficients. Further, refitting the model with a slightly modified model structure allows extracting the appropriate standard errors for treatment groups directly from the model. 3. Centring will make main effects biologically interpretable even when involved in interactions and thus avoids the potential misinterpretation of main effects. This also applies to the estimation of linear effects in the presence of polynomials. Categorical input variables can also be centred and this sometimes assists interpretation. 4. Standardization ( z ‐transformation) of input variables results in the estimation of standardized slopes or standardized partial regression coefficients. Standardized slopes are comparable in magnitude within models as well as between studies. They have some advantages over partial correlation coefficients and are often the more interesting standardized effect size. 5. The thoughtful removal of intercepts or main effects allows extracting treatment means or treatment slopes and their appropriate standard errors directly from a linear model. This provides a simple alternative to the more complicated calculation of standard errors from contrasts and main effects. 6. The simple methods presented here put the focus on parameter estimation (point estimates as well as confidence intervals) rather than on significance thresholds. They allow fitting complex, but meaningful models that can be concisely presented and interpreted. The presented methods can also be applied to generalised linear models (GLM) and linear mixed models.",W1609810996,False,0.6441307663917542
https://doi.org/10.1139/er-2012-0033,Competition theory — science and application in mixed forest stands: review of experimental and modelling methods and suggestions for future research,"Competition in forest stands has long been of interest to researchers. However, much of the knowledge originates from empirical studies that examined the effects of competition. For instance, many studies were focused on the effects of the presence of herbaceous species on the development of tree seedlings or the decrease in individual tree growth with increases in stand density. Several models that incorporate competitive effects have been developed to predict tree and stand growth, but with simplified representations of competitive interactions. While these studies provided guidance useful for forest management, they contributed only partially to furthering our understanding of competitive mechanisms. Also, most competition studies were conducted in single-species stands. As competitive interactions occurring in mixed stands are characterized by a higher degree of complexity than those in single-species stands, a better understanding of these mechanisms can contribute to developing optimal management scenarios. The dynamics of forest stands with at least two species may be affected not only by competition, but also by facilitation or complementarity mechanisms. Thus, knowledge of the mechanisms may provide insight into the relative importance of intra- versus inter-specific competition and whether competition is symmetric or asymmetric. Special attention to the implementation of field experimental designs is warranted for mixed stands. While traditional spacing trials are appropriate for single-species stands, the examination of competitive interactions in mixed stands requires more complex experimental designs to examine the relative importance of species combinations. Forest productivity models allow resource managers to test different management scenarios, but again most of these models were developed for single-species stands. As competitive interactions are more complex in mixed stands, models developed to predict their dynamics will need to include more mechanistic representations of competition.",W1882931913,False,0.8786255717277527

The traditional concept of zone of influence in competition indices was redefined, and differences in asymmetry in above- and below-ground competition were represented. The availability of remeasured crown dimensions data allowed for realistic representation of the dynamics of crown interference at the canopy level. Diameter at breast height (dbh) increment was expressed in terms of absolute growth rate, relative growth rate, and ratio of absolute growth rate to crown width. The best relationships accounted for at least 80% of the variability in dbh increment. When tested on an independent data set, the model predicted dbh increment relatively accurately under different conditions of stand density. In particular, the change in dbh size distribution with the increase in competitive stress was well represented. FOR. SCI. 48 (1):24–34.",W145977984,False,0.7724830508232117

Lianas have among the largest (up to 8 metres or more) and widest (up to 500 µ m) vessels in the plant kingdom. In conifers the water transport occurs through tracheids, which are relatively inefficient in transport. We can compare disparate growth forms in terms of leaf-specific. conductivity (LSC), which is hydraulic conductivity per surface area of leaves supplied by a stem. LSC is inversely proportional to localised pressure potential gradients. LSC is equal to the Huber value (sapwood area per leaf area supplied) times the specific conductivity (hydraulic conductivity per sapwood area). Lianas are similar to dicot trees and conifers in having hydraulic constrictions (low LSCs) at branch junctions. However, lianas generally have greater LSCs and specific conductivities but lower Huber values than do conifers. Dicot trees are intermediate in these values. The narrow but efficient stems of lianas are possible partly because lianas are not self-supporting; the mechanical requirements are reduced. Secondly, the wide and efficient vessels of lianas remain conductive for much longer than might be expected (two to several years, versus one year for similar wide vessels in dicots). Based upon experiments with glass capillary tubes and with living stem tissue, larger vessels are more susceptible to freezinginduced embolism than are small ones. However, in lianas, root pressures might serve to refill cavitated vessels on a daily or seasonal basis.",W2008740254,False,0.8274978995323181

https://doi.org/10.2307/2258570,Some Ecological Consequences of a Computer Model of Forest Growth,"The complexity of a forest ecosystem makes difficult any attempt to synthesize knowledge about forest dynamics or to perceive the implications of information and assumptions regarding forest growth. Although digital computer simulation seems to offer a potential for creating a complete model of forest growth, little progress has been reported. Computer simulation has been carried out for the growth of trees in even-aged stands of a single species (Mitchell 1969), and for meteorological energy exchange in a forest canopy (Waggoner & Reifsnyder 1968). A specific simulation built directly from Hubbard Brook data has been reported (Siccama et al. 1969). Successional change in northern hardwood forests has been predicted from observed birth and death rates (Leak 1970). A conceptual model has been created for the growth of individual tree seedlings from rates of photosynthesis and the distribution of photosynthates (Ledig 1969). Computer simulation has been carried out for some aspects in a few other terrestrial ecosystems, such as productivity in a corn crop (Duncan et al. 1967); but apparently no one has successfully reproduced the major characteristics of a mixed-species, mixed-aged forest from a conceptual basis. A computer simulation of forest growth is now developed that successfully reproduces the population dynamics of the trees in a mixed-species forest of north-east North America. The simulator is designed to be used in the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study and to provide output in the same form as the original vegetation survey of that study (Bormann et al. 1970). However, the underlying concepts of the simulation are general. The properties of each species are derived from its entire geographic range and in theory any non-hydrophytic species whose relevant characteristics are known can be entered into the simulation. In the present version of the program, the description of the environment is restricted to those features that have been recorded for the Hubbard Brook Forest, but the relative importance attached to each environmental factor has been influenced by the environmental characteristics of the north-eastern United States. It is hoped that a wide dissemination of this simulator will encourage others to test this version with their data and hence lead to later versions of wider usefulness and applicability. The basic goal was to produce a dynamic model of forest growth, a model in which changes in the state of the forest are a function of the present state and random components. This approach has two advantages over the curve-fitting approach to forest growth: first, the simulator can be regarded as a repository for an integrated knowledge of the ecosystem; second, additional hypotheses can be formulated and tested using Monte Carlo samples of simulator runs and comparing the results with observed data.

The assessment of pain postoperatively can be a challenge in patients who are obtunded (not fully alert) and the severity of pain has historically been underestimated. There are also concerns about side-effects from drugs, particularly with opioids, which may lead to reluctance to administer effective doses. Paracetamol is generally safe and, if given intravenously, provides rapid analgesia, although there are risks associated with overdose and care must be taken to ensure that the safe daily limit is not exceeded. Opioids are effective but side effects of pupillary constriction and respiratory depression may be problematic in the neurosurgical patient. The total use of systemic analgesia can be minimised with the use of regional techniques, such as local anaesthetic nerve blocks. A multimodal technique, using different agents, is most likely to be effective.",W1020798780,False,0.0010209769243374467

A 1992 meta-analysis by Ballantyne found a strong patient preference for PCA over conventional analgesia but disclosed no differences in analgesic consumption or length of postoperative hospital stay. Although Ballantyne's meta-analysis found that PCA did have a small but statistically significant benefit upon pain intensity, Walder's review in 2001 did not find a significant differences in pain intensity and pain relief between PCA and conventionally treated groups.To evaluate the efficacy of PCA versus conventional analgesia (such as a nurse administering an analgesic upon a patient's request) for postoperative pain control.Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2004, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to 2004), and EMBASE (1994 to 2004). Additional reports were identified from the reference lists of retrieved papers.RCTs of PCA versus conventional analgesia that employed pain intensity as a primary or secondary outcome were selected. These trials included RCTs that compared PCA without a continuous background infusion versus conventional parenteral analgesic regimens. Studies that explicitly stated they involved patients with chronic pain were excluded.Trials were scored using the Oxford Quality Scale. Meta-analyses were performed of outcomes that included analgesic efficacy assessed by a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), analgesic consumption, patient satisfaction, length of stay and adverse effects. A sufficient number of the retrieved trials reported these parameters to permit meta-analyses.Fifty-five studies with 2023 patients receiving PCA and 1838 patients assigned to a control group met inclusion criteria. PCA provided better pain control and greater patient satisfaction than conventional parenteral 'as-needed' analgesia. Patients using PCA consumed higher amounts of opioids than the controls and had a higher incidence of pruritus (itching) but had a similar incidence of other adverse effects. There was no difference in the length of hospital stay.This review provides evidence that PCA is an efficacious alternative to conventional systemic analgesia for postoperative pain control.",W1492220811,False,0.024169962853193283

The use of narcotic pain medications can be costly, decrease rates of early postoperative ambulation, lengthen hospital stays, and alter a patient's neurological examination. The use of alternative pain medications such as tramadol may benefit patients by resolving many of these issues.The authors conducted a randomized, blinded prospective study to evaluate the efficacy of alternative pain management strategies for patients following craniotomies. Fifty patients were randomly assigned either to a control group who received narcotics and acetaminophen alone or an experimental group who received tramadol in addition to narcotic pain medications (25 patients assigned to each group).The control group was noted to have statistically significant higher visual analog scale pain scores, an increased length of hospital stay, and increased narcotic use compared with the tramadol group. The narcotics and acetaminophen group also had increased hospitalization costs when compared with the tramadol group.The use of scheduled atypical analgesics such as tramadol in addition to narcotics with acetaminophen for the management of postoperative pain after craniotomy may provide better pain control, decrease the side effects associated with narcotic pain medications, encourage earlier postoperative ambulation, and reduce total hospitalization costs.",W1554879472,False,0.0028859495650976896

Infectious diseases provide some of the best‐studied examples of the role of seasonality in shaping population fluctuations. In this paper, we review examples from human and wildlife disease systems to illustrate the challenges inherent in understanding the mechanisms and impacts of seasonal environmental drivers. Empirical evidence points to several biologically distinct mechanisms by which seasonality can impact host–pathogen interactions, including seasonal changes in host social behaviour and contact rates, variation in encounters with infective stages in the environment, annual pulses of host births and deaths and changes in host immune defences. Mathematical models and field observations show that the strength and mechanisms of seasonality can alter the spread and persistence of infectious diseases, and that population‐level responses can range from simple annual cycles to more complex multiyear fluctuations. From an applied perspective, understanding the timing and causes of seasonality offers important insights into how parasite–host systems operate, how and when parasite control measures should be applied, and how disease risks will respond to anthropogenic climate change and altered patterns of seasonality. Finally, by focusing on well‐studied examples of infectious diseases, we hope to highlight general insights that are relevant to other ecological interactions.",W1537506907,False,0.0011949677718803287

Yet ecological understanding of ecosystem services is quite limited. Previous work maps the supply and demand for services, assesses threats to them, and estimates economic values, but does not measure the underlying role of biodiversity in providing services. In contrast, experimental studies of biodiversity-function examine communities whose structures often differ markedly from those providing services in real landscapes. A bridge is needed between these two approaches. To develop this research agenda, I discuss critical questions and key approaches in four areas: (1) identifying the important 'ecosystem service providers'; (2) determining the various aspects of community structure that influence function in real landscapes, especially compensatory community responses that stabilize function, or non-random extinction sequences that rapidly erode it; (3) assessing key environmental factors influencing provision of services, and (4) measuring the spatio-temporal scale over which providers and services operate. I show how this research agenda can assist in developing environmental policy and natural resource management plans.",W1905536488,False,0.816785454750061

The encoded precursor is 57 amino acids long, with a 23-residue leader region and a 34-residue structural region. The structural region contains serines, threonines, and cysteines at exactly the positions required to give mature nisin by a series of post-translational modifications involving dehydration of serines and threonines to dehydro forms, and cross-linking with cysteine residues. S1 mapping revealed a 267-nucleotide transcript of the nisin gene that is expressed during vegetative growth and stationary phase. It has a half-life of 7-10 min. The absence of an identifiable promoter or rho-independent terminator and the detection of two different 5′-ends of the transcript suggested it is a processing product from a larger RNA. This may represent a polycistronic mRNA which may also encode proteins involved in processing the nisin precursor peptide. Open reading frames were found in regions flanking the nisin gene. The one downstream had a ribosome binding site and appeared to be transcribed by read-through from the nisin gene. The one upstream had significant homology to a putative transposase from the Escherichia coli IS2 insertion element. Comparison of gene sequence homologies between nisin and the other lanthionine antibiotics, subtilin and epidermin, indicated that they all evolved from a common ancestor. Corresponding leader peptide sequences showed mediocre amino acid homology, but nearly perfect hydropathic homologies, suggesting a common function.

https://doi.org/10.2307/1911925,The Prisoner's Dilemma and Dynamical Systems Associated to Non-Cooperative Games,"A new way of looking at repeated games is introduced which incorporates a bounded memory and rationality. In these terms, a resolution of the prisoner's dilemma is given. THE GOAL HERE is to give a natural way of introducing dynamics into game theory, or at least for non-cooperative games. Perhaps the main idea in this treatment of dynamics is the way the past is taken into account. We suppose for both mathematical and model theoretic considerations that the agents only keep some kind of summary or average of the past outcomes (or payoffs) in their memory. Decisions are based on this summary. This kind of modeling reflects the fact that there exist substantive bounds to the storing and organizing of information. We give an axiomatization of bounded memory and rationality, with both institutions and people in mind. On the other hand, the hypothesis used in this treatment leads to a tractable mathematics. Differential equations on function spaces which contain little geometry are replaced by a dynamics on a finite dimensional space. And yet dynamics takes the past into account as a kind of substitute for the theory of delay equations. The perspective in this paper is that of no finite horizon and no discounting of the future. There is always a tomorrow in our plans, and it is as important as today. Also there is a history, a beginning of history, but no end. Decisions are based on the effect of past actions of agents, not on promises or binding agreements. However communication is certainly not precluded. Solutions in our games are asymptotic solutions.

,The emergence of norms,"This book provides an account of the emergence of norms. Put very crudely, the main thesis of this book is that certain types of norms are possible solutions to problems posed by certain types of social interaction situations. The problems are such that they inhere in the structure (in the game-theoretical sense of structure) of the situations concerned. Three types of paradigmatic situations are dealt with. They are referred to as Prisoners' Dilemma-type situations; co-ordination situations; and inequality (or partiality) situations. Each of them, it is claimed, poses a basic difficulty, to some or all of the individuals involved in them. Three types of norms, respectively, are offered as solutions to these situational problems. It is shown how, and in what sense, the adoption of these norms of social behaviour can indeed resolve the specified problems.",W2144623884,False,0.001294718007557094

The morphological stage of inhibition, cooperativity effects, effect of pH on inhibition, kinetics of protection against iodoacetate incorporation into membrane sulfhydryl groups, and protection against the bacteriocidal effect of carboxymethylation by iodoacetate indicate that nitrite acts as a membrane-directed sulfhydryl agent. The mechanism by which nitrite modifies the chemical reactivity of the sulfhydryl group could be either direct covalent modification or inactivation through communication with another modified membrane component. Profiles of pH effects suggest that the active agent is the protonated form of nitrite. The nitrite concentrations which modify membrane sulfhydryl activity coincide with those which have a bacteriostatic effect. These results are consistent with membrane sulfhydryl modification as a component of the mechanism of nitrite-induced bacteriostasis in this aerobic sporeformer.",W1498714700,False,0.14973528683185577

Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra at 8-60 K of NADH-reduced membrane particles prepared from Paracoccus denitrificans grown anaerobically with nitrate as terminal electron acceptor show the presence of iron-sulfur centers 1-4 in the NADH-ubiquinone segment of the respiratory chain.

Sulphate-limited growth under anaerobic conditions does not affect the iron-sulfur pattern of NADH dehydrogenase or nitrate reductase. Furthermore respiratory chain-linked electron transport and its inhibition by rotenone are not influenced. These results contrast those observed for sulphate-limited growth of P. denitrificans under aerobic conditions [Eur. J. Biochem. (1977) 81, 267-275]. 3. Proton translocation studies of whole cells indicate that nitrite increases the proton conductance of the cytoplasmic membrane, resulting in a collapse of the proton gradient across the membrane. Nitrite accumulates under anaerobic growth conditions with nitrate as terminal electron acceptor; the extent of accumulation depends on the specific growth conditions. Thus the low efficiencies of respiratory chain-linked energy conservation observed during nitrate respiration [Arch. Microbiol.

https://doi.org/10.2983/035.034.0203,The Exposed Surface Area to Volume Ratio: Is Shell More Efficient than Limestone in Promoting Oyster Recruitment?,"Planting oyster cultch is a common management approach used to enhance recruitment. The two most popular cultch materials are shell and limestone. Both are sold by volume or weight; however, once deposited on oyster grounds, only a small portion of the total surface area of each particle is available for recruitment. Shell and limestone have different surface area to volume properties, and thus provide differential settlement opportunities. Exposed surface area to volume (expSA/V) ratios of oyster shell and limestone fragments were compared, as an indicator of their recruitment potential and cost-effectiveness for cultch planting. Samples were collected from the Primary Public Oyster Seed Grounds in Louisiana by vibracore, and from the Pass Christian TongingGrounds in Mississippi by dredge. Shell (including whole shell and fragments) and limestone particles greater than or equal to 8 mm by geometric shape were classified and their expSA/V was calculated. Mean expSA/V ratios of shell were approximately three to nine times higher than limestone. For limestone of similar particle size to provide an equivalent recruitment benefit for the same cost would require that the cost of purchase, transport, and planting be three to nine times lower than shell. Thus, shell is likely to be a more efficient material than limestone for recruitment enhancement. Nevertheless, the higher variability in expSA/V of shell and other factors such as the expected lifetime and the relative performance of small and large particles of materials should also be considered. Analysis of a Louisiana limestone plant and associated oyster cultch showed that the proportion of small and large limestone particles and the relative proportion of whole shells and fragments can greatly alter expSA/V. In this case, the a priori expectation that oyster shell would outperform limestone did not materialize because of the quantity of small limestone particles of favorable shapes in the deployed material. Even so, as yet unknown is the possible reduction in performance in situ of smaller particles that might occur if they increase the one-dimensionality of the plant.",W1932991953,False,0.20744796097278595

Such ubiquity makes body size an obvious candidate source of general rules that can be derived from selective processes acting on individuals, but which can also be applied at higher levels of ecological organization (Cousins, 1980; Peters, 1983; Dickie, Kerr & Boudreau, 1987; Yodzis & Innes, 1992; Cohen et al., 1993; Gaston & Blackburn, 2000; Cohen, Jonsson & Carpenter, 2003; Emmerson & Raffaelli, 2004). Although body size was identified as a key link between natural history aspects of population dynamics and community structure many decades ago (e.g. Hardy, 1924; Elton, 1927; Hutchinson, 1959), these early ideas have languished somewhat until relatively recently. In the last two to three decades a plethora of allometric body-size scaling relationships have been described and used to derive mechanisms to explain, or parameters to model, general patterns in natural systems (e.g. Peters, 1983). Recently, it has been suggested that basal metabolic rate is the fundamental constraint that underpins many of the size-related patterns and processes observed in natural systems, and that a metabolic theory of ecology could, eventually, attain similar importance to that of the genetic theory of evolutionary biology (Brown et al., 2004; Brown, Allen & Gillooly, this volume).",W1132994286,False,0.8965200185775757

The experimental system consisted of restored subtidal oyster reefs inhabited by the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. To determine whether the size of reefs influences the flow environment and oyster performance, reefs of four heights—tall (2 m), short (1 m), dredged (0.6 m), and low (0.1 m)—were constructed at 3-m water depth in the Neuse River estuary, North Carolina, USA. To test whether oyster performance varies with water depth and hydrographic conditions, tall and short reefs were also constructed at 6-m water depth. Flow speed, sedimentation, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and the performance of oysters were measured as a function of reef height, position on reef, and water depth over a 10-mo period. Flow speed was found to increase on reefs with reef height and elevation on reefs. Rates of sediment deposition were seasonally highest where flow speed was lowest, at the bases of reefs, and seasonally decreased with increasing water depth. More than 90% of the surface area of low reefs was buried after only 16 mo of exposure in the estuary, indicating that reef height controls habitat quality (and quantity) indirectly through its effect on flow. Short reefs and the bases of tall reefs at 6-m depth were exposed to a total of 26 d of hypoxia/anoxia. No other reef treatment was exposed to >5 d of hypoxia. Physical conditions on experimental reefs had a profound influence on the performance of oysters as the flow environment alone explained 81% of variability in oyster growth and mortality. Recruitment of oysters over a 2-mo period was slightly higher on the front bases than the crests of reefs, but did not vary with reef height or water depth. After 10 mo, the shell growth and condition index of genetically similar, hatchery-raised oysters were greatest on the crests of tall and short reefs, where flow speed and quality of suspended food material were highest, and sediment deposition was lowest. Growth was greatest overall at the crests of tall reefs located at 6-m water depth where flow speed was high, and the numbers of days exposed to hypoxia/anoxia and variation in salinity were lowest. Total percentage mortality of oysters after 10 mo was greater on low reefs located at 3-m depth than on all other reef types and was greater on the bases than crests of tall, short, and dredged reefs. Predation by crabs and fishes accounted for 4–20% of total oyster mortality and showed no pattern across reef treatments. Results of this experiment indicate (1) that the physical structure and location of biogenic habitat controls local physical variables and (2) that, in turn, physical variables, especially flow speed, have a profound influence on the performance of a resident species. Realization that an ecological function of habitat is to indirectly control local population production through physical–biological coupling should improve our ability to conserve, restore, and manage habitat and associated species diversity. Better ecological engineering of restored oyster reef habitat is likely to improve fishery production and help maintain estuarine biodiversity.",W2052761847,False,0.6490536332130432

The optimal defence theory (ODT) of chemical defence provides a predictive framework for the distribution of anti‐herbivore defences in plants. One of its predictions is that chemical defences will be allocated within a plant as a function of tissue value, where value is correlated with the cost of having that tissue removed. While many studies have examined intra‐plant variation in defence chemistry, these results have rarely been compiled quantitatively to assess whether defence allocation is consistent with the prediction of ODT that more valuable tissues should be more defended than less valuable tissues. 2. We performed a formal meta‐analysis of published and unpublished studies to examine the predictive utility of ODT. Specifically, we examined whether defence chemicals occur at higher concentrations in flowers versus leaves and in younger leaves compared to older leaves, under the assumption that younger leaves are more valuable than older leaves. We also examined whether the expansion status of younger leaves, nodal position of the leaves, growing conditions and chemical class of defence compounds affected the mean effect sizes. 3. We found that tissues with higher assumed value had significantly higher concentrations of defence chemicals than tissues with lower value. In particular, we found that younger leaves had higher concentrations of defence chemicals than older leaves, consistent with the predictions of ODT. The magnitude of this difference was higher in the younger leaf/older leaf comparison than in the flower/leaf comparison, with no evidence that flowers were more defended than leaves. The overall results were not affected by chemical class, young leaf expansion status, growing conditions or leaf position on the plant. 4. Synthesis. We found general agreement between the predictions of ODT and the intraplant distribution of chemical defence and conclude it is a useful model. The effect size varied depending on the tissue compared. Explicit measures of tissue value, in particular as it relates to relative fitness, are required to further validate the predictive utility and general applicability of ODT.",W1661795662,False,0.4161258041858673

Induced changes in plant quality can mediate indirect interactions between herbivores. Although the sequence of attack by different herbivores has been shown to influence plant responses, little is known about how this affects the herbivores themselves. 2. We therefore investigated how induction by the leaf herbivore Spodoptera frugiperda influences resistance of teosinte ( Zea mays mexicana) and cultivated maize (Zea mays mays) against root‐feeding larvae of Diabrotica virgifera virgifera. The importance of the sequence of arrival was tested in the field and laboratory. 3. Spodoptera frugiperda infestation had a significant negative effect on colonization by D. virgifera larvae in the field and weight gain in the laboratory, but only when S. frugiperda arrived on the plant before the root herbivore. When S. frugiperda arrived after the root herbivore had established, no negative effects on larval performance were detected. Yet, adult emergence of D. virgifera was reduced even when the root feeder had established first, indicating that the negative effects were not entirely absent in this treatment. 4. The defoliation of the plants was not a decisive factor for the negative effects on root herbivore development, as both minor and major leaf damage resulted in an increase in root resistance and the extent of biomass removal was not correlated with root‐herbivore growth. We propose that leaf‐herbivore‐induced increases in feeding‐deterrent and/or toxic secondary metabolites may account for the sequence‐specific reduction in root‐herbivore performance. 5. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate that the sequence of arrival can be an important determinant of plant‐mediated interactions between insect herbivores in both wild and cultivated plants. Arriving early on a plant may be an important strategy of insects to avoid competition with other herbivores. To fully understand plant‐mediated interactions between insect herbivores, the sequence of arrival should be taken into account.",W1891375014,False,0.8921811580657959

The passive consequence of chilling the eggs of this species is a synchronization of hatch; the chilling does not break diapause. A hypothetical model (and its mathematical expression) explaining diapause in this species was derived from the data. Initial hatch in the non‐diapause strain occurred in 24 days at 20°. In an unchilled‐unselected population, the mean minimum period of development to initial hatch (both pre‐diapause and post‐diapause development) was ca. 24 days, and the duration of the mean dormant period was ca. 78 days. The duration of the dormant period is probably quantitatively inherited since this character appears to have enormous genetic plasticity.

https://doi.org/10.1086/283754,Prey Distribution as a Factor Determining the Choice of Optimal Foraging Strategy,"The optimal-patch-use problem in predation theory is investigated by use of a stochastic discrete model to match experimental situations when deterministic continuous models are inappropriate. We first consider three elementary strategies, differing in when to leave the patch in which the predator has been foraging; namely, (1) a fixed time has passed, (2) a fixed number of prey has been captured, and (3) the interval between two successive catches has exceeded a fixed time. Each of these fixed quantities has same value that optimizes the strategy concerned, given certain conditions. The optimized strategies are compared to determine the most efficient. It is shown that the ranking of the strategies depends critically on the type of prey distribution between patches, other things being equal; e.g., strategy 3, the best when the variance of prey distribution is sufficiently high, tends to be the worst when the variance is minimal. The above strategies do not use full information for estimating the number of prey remaining in the patch; for example, every time interval between two successive catches might be used by a more sophisticated predator. The statistical decision theory reveals, however, that the number of prey already taken (n) and the total time spent foraging (t) in the patch are the minimal sufficient statistics for estimating the number of unexploited prey under the random-search assumption. In other words, under the assumption of random search the estimator r is a function of n and t only at most, and detailed knowledge of the distribution of the time intervals is immaterial. Thus, the sophisticated predator should leave the patch when the estimator r(n,t) falls below a certain value that optimizes the strategy adopted. The estimator r depends on the prey distribution: If prey are distributed contagiously, estimated value of the remaining prey jumps up each time a capture is made, but it steps down if prey are distributed regularly. However, r may be a function of n or t alone, depending on the type of the between-patch distribution of prey. In particular, r is a function of n only for a completely regular distribution, and the best strategy is reduced to elementary strategy 2. If the distribution is random (Poisson), r is a function of t only. Then the best strategy becomes simply elementary strategy 1. It is pointed out that whether the predator under observation actually behaves optimally in accordance with the distribution of prey should be revealed by plotting the number of captures against the length of period for which the predator stayed in each patch.",W1964593603,False,0.26145145297050476

However, we report here for the first time that Pieris brassicae, commonly assumed to be a typical folivore, actually prefers to feed on flowers of three Brassica nigra genotypes rather than on their leaves. First- and second-instar caterpillars were observed to feed primarily on leaves, whereas late second and early third instars migrated via the small leaves of the flower branches to the flower buds and flowers. Once flower feeding began, no further leaf feeding was observed. We investigated growth rates of caterpillars having access exclusively to either leaves of flowering plants or flowers. In addition, we analyzed glucosinolate concentrations in leaves and flowers. Late-second- and early-third-instar P. brassicae caterpillars moved upward into the inflorescences of B. nigra and fed on buds and flowers until the end of the final (fifth) instar, after which they entered into the wandering stage, leaving the plant in search of a pupation site. Flower feeding sustained a significantly higher growth rate than leaf feeding. Flowers contained levels of glucosinolates up to five times higher than those of leaves. Five glucosinolates were identified: the aliphatic sinigrin, the aromatic phenylethylglucosinolate, and three indole glucosinolates: glucobrassicin, 4-methoxyglucobrassicin, and 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin. Tissue type and genotype were the most important factors affecting levels of identified glucosinolates. Sinigrin was by far the most abundant compound in all three genotypes. Sinigrin, 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin, and phenylethylglucosinolate were present at significantly higher levels in flowers than in leaves. In response to caterpillar feeding, sinigrin levels in both leaves and flowers were significantly higher than in undamaged plants, whereas 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin leaf levels were lower. Our results show that feeding on flower tissues, containing higher concentrations of glucosinolates, provides P. brassicae with a nutritional benefit in terms of higher growth rate. This preference appears to be in contrast to published negative effects of volatile glucosinolate breakdown products on the closely related Pieris rapae.",W1978612940,False,0.6105629801750183

https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.15.3.281a,Host-Finding by Insect Parasites,"ABSTRACT Experiments are described in which Trichogramma females were provided with Sitotroga eggs arranged at various distances from 0·05 to 0·40 in. The frequency with which the parasite found the neighbouring egg varied inversely with the distance between the eggs. The relation between frequency of contact and distance between the hosts depends chiefly, but not entirely, on chance. The rate of finding the eggs varied inversely with the distance between them. By consideration of the conditions of the experiments, this relation between the rate of finding and the distance between the eggs is seen to indicate that the Trichogramma does not seek at random over the whole area available for movement but restricts its search to the neighbourhood of hosts. From experiments with eggs of four sizes it is shown that frequency of neighbouring contact is correlated positively with the size of the eggs. The influence of size is largely mechanical ; but not entirely, for small eggs of Sitotroga are found less efficiently in proportion to their size than are larger eggs. When provided simultaneously with hosts of two different sizes, a Trichogramma finds more of the larger than of the smaller hosts. If the hosts are arranged alternately, the amount of selection that occurs by finding depends entirely upon the relative sizes of the eggs. If they are arranged in separate groups, however, relatively more of the larger eggs are found.",W1913444183,False,0.322222501039505

The models are based on simplified assumptions concerning planktonic and benthic predation and the relations between egg size and method of larval nutrition and between egg size and duration of larval life. The model's predictions include: (a) only the extremes of the possible range of egg size and method of nutrition (i.e., planktotrophy, lecithotrophy) are evolutionarily stable; (b) over a certain range of environmental parameters, the two developmental modes are both evolutionarily stable; (c) planktotrophy is more efficient than lecithotrophy when planktonic food is abundant and planktonic predation low, and lecithotrophy more efficient when either or both of these conditions is reversed; and (d) benthic prefeeding development results in greater efficiency when lecithotrophic development time is long and/or planktonic predation more intense than benthic predation, and planktonic prefeeding development is more efficient when these conditions are reversed. Known geographic trends in developmental patterns are discussed in light of these results, and possible explanations for these trends are offered.

https://doi.org/10.1029/ar005p0039,"Reproductive periodicities in several contrasting populations of<i>Odontaster Validus</i>Koehler, A common Antarctic asteroid","Reproductive and related changes are followed for one year in two populations of the common omnivorous Antarctic asteroid Odontaster validus Koehler. At McMurdo Station, the site of one population, the fast ice breaks out late in the summer or not at all, and there is a relatively low amount of annual sunlight penetration into the sea. Twenty-two km north of McMurdo Station at Cape Evans, the other site, the fast ice breaks out in midsummer, and much more sunlight penetrates into the sea. Probably because of the higher amount of sunlight penetrating into the sea, there seems to be much more summer phytoproduction at Cape Evans than at McMurdo Station. Reflecting this probable difference in summer phytoproduction, the pyloric caeca of only the animals at Cape Evans accumulate large amounts of protein, lipid, carbohydrate, and green chlorophyll derivatives in the summer, and these animals are larger, more numerous, and more darkly pigmented than those at McMurdo Station. Samples from other sites in McMurdo Sound suggest that there is a gradation at least from the population at Cape Evans to that at McMurdo Station, and O. validus seems to be absent under the Ross Ice Shelf. One sample from Hallett Station, about 650 km north of McMurdo Station, is similar to those from Cape Evans. The animals at Cape Evans produce many more gametes than those at McMurdo Station, yet gametogenesis is similar and synchronous in the two populations. Spermatogenesis proceeds through five discrete cell stages in 7–10 months, while oögenesis takes 18–24 months and involves growth of distinct successive annual generations of primary oöcytes. In both sexes there is a more or less constant uptake of nutrients into the gonads all year, and where food fluctuates seasonally and is most abundant in the summer, as at Cape Evans, nutrients are stored in the pyloric caeca for later utilization in gametogenesis. Many oöcytes act as storage cells which further enable the ovaries to assimilate nutrients at a rather constant rate. Initiation of gametogenesis occurs between May or June and February. Because light and quantitative food changes are so different between McMurdo Station and Cape Evans, these factors probably have little effect on the synchronization of gametogenesis among individuals. Qualitative annual changes in phytoproduction or slight changes in temperature or salinity may be more important, however. Spawning occurs mainly from June to mid-September and may be synchronized by environmental changes related to low-temperature water lenses present in the midwinter. The winter spawning period of O. validus is probably an adaptation to the slow embryonic and larval developmental rates which allow the demersal bipinnaria larvae to appear during the summer phytoproduction period. The spring, winter, or fall spawning periods of many other polar species with planktotrophic larvae or young are apparently related similarly to the rates of embryonic and larval development and the summer phytoproduction period.

Conservation policy and practice assume that PAs are permanent fixtures on the landscape, but scattered evidence points to widespread—yet largely overlooked—PA downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement (PADDD). As a preliminary investigation of PADDD and its implications for conservation science and policy, we explore the published literature and contemporary media reports. We identify 89 historic instances of PADDD, in 27 countries, since 1900. Contemporary accounts reveal that PADDD has recently occurred or is currently under consideration in at least 12 countries worldwide. Proximate causes of PADDD vary widely, but center on access to and use of natural resources. Case studies from India and South America highlight the fact that PAs are socially defined and socially constructed governance regimes, responsive to social pressures—including conservation demands—at local to global scales. PADDD challenges longstanding assumptions underlying conservation policy and practice, including efforts to reduce deforestation and forest degradation (REDD), and underscores the need for resilient and robust conservation strategies. Because many fundamental questions regarding PADDD remain unanswered, further research is required to understand this conservation phenomenon and develop tailored policy responses.",W1481551658,False,0.26333341002464294

Spatial conservation prioritization is the process of using spatial analysis of quantitative data to identify locations for conservation investment. The process is regarded as more systematic, rigorous, and accountable than the opportunistic allocation of conservation funds (Margules and Pressey 2000). Priority areas can be identified not only for protected area establishment but also for investment in a variety of conservation activities, ranging from fire management and invasive species control, to land restoration (Wilson et al. 2007) (Chapters 3 and 12). Since its origin in the early 1980s, the field of spatial conservation prioritization has influenced planning processes, the development of conservation policies, and the expansion of protected areas. As a consequence, the number of publications concerning the development and application of spatial prioritization techniques has increased rapidly over the past two decades (Chapters 1 and 19).",W1488119176,False,0.6340140104293823

He considers the significant challenges facing existing parks and examines problems inherent in alternative approaches, such as ecotourism, the exploitation of nontimber forest products, sustainable use, and sustainable development. Throughout, Terborgh argues that the greatest challenges of conservation are not scientific, but are social, economic, and political, and that success will require simultaneous progress on all fronts.

The use of behavioural traits by females in signalling condition has been practically ignored in evolutionary theory. However, females may also exhibit ornaments and behavioural displays, although less elaborated than those of males. 2. In this study we suggest that the carrying of feathers by spotless starlings Sturnus unicolor Temminck females to decorate the nest represents an elaborated and costly behaviour that is displayed in response to a courtship male behaviour: the carrying of nest green plants. 3. By experimentally increasing the amount of green plants in the nests, to give the appearance that highly attractive males defended them, we induced females to increase their feather carrying rates. 4. The amount of feathers carried to the nest was correlated to female reproductive experience and laying date, two variables correlated with female body condition. These results suggests that this behaviour may work as an honest indicator of female quality. 5. We conclude that male carrying plants and female carrying feathers can be viewed as two sex-specific functionally related signalling behaviours involved in mutual courtship or status signalling.",W1593833502,False,0.7290135025978088

https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1420-9101.2001.00274.x,Female- and male-specific signals of quality in the barn owl,"Abstract Most bird studies of female signalling have been confined to species in which females display a male-ornament in a vestigial form. However, a great deal of benefit may be gained from considering phenotypic traits that are specific to females. This is because (1) sex-specific traits may signal sex-specific qualities and (2) females may develop a male-ornament not because they are selected to do so, but because fathers transmit to daughters the underlying genes for its expression (genetic correlation between the sexes). We investigated these two propositions in the barn owl Tyto alba, a species in which male plumage is lighter in colour and less marked with black spots than that of females. Firstly, we present published evidence that female plumage spottiness reflects parasite resistance ability. We also show that male plumage coloration is correlated with reproductive success, male feeding rate and heart mass. Secondly, cross-fostering experiments demonstrate that plumage coloration and spottiness are genetically correlated between the sexes. This implies that if a given trait value is selected in one sex, the other sex will indirectly evolve towards a similar value. This prediction is supported by the observation that female plumage coloration and spottiness resembled that of males, in comparisons at the level of Tyto alba alba populations, Tyto alba subspecies and Tyto species. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that sex-specific traits signal sex-specific qualities and that a gene for a sex-specific trait can be expressed in the other sex as the consequence of a genetic correlation between the sexes.",W1549824039,False,0.882369339466095

,The theory of sex allocation.,"This book is the first comprehensive treatment of sex allocation from the standpoint of modern evolutionary theory. It shows how the determination of sex ratio, resource allocation to sperm versus egg within simultaneous hermaphroditism, and the evolution of sex reversal can he explained as examples of a single process. The genetical theory, developed mostly with graphical arguments, also specifies when hermaphroditism and dioecy are themselves evolutionary stable. The work balances theory with field and laboratory research, providing critical tests of the theory by empirical studies of sex ratio in parasitoid wasps and mites, sex reversal in shrimp and coral reef fish, and allocation of resources to pollen versus seeds in higher plants. In addition, the author oilers an encyclopedic review of the field and laboratory work of other scientists, reviews many as yet untested hypotheses in sex allocation, and points toward numerous plant and animal systems that hold promise for future tests.",W1591031213,False,0.018827924504876137
https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1999.0704,Condition–dependent variation in the blue–ultraviolet coloration of a structurally based plumage ornament,"After years of investigation into the function of sexually dimorphic ornamental traits, researchers are beginning to understand how bright plumage colour in birds acts as an intraspecific signal. This work has focused primarily on pigment–based ornaments because they are highly variable in patch size, hue and brightness for some species. In contrast, structurally based ornaments have been little studied, in part because they do not appear to be as variable as pigment–based ornaments. We investigated a structurally based plumage ornament in a wild population of blue grosbeaks (Guiraca caerulea), a sexually dimorphic passerine. We report plumage variation that extends into the ultraviolet region of the spectrum. The pattern of covariation between four out of five elements of plumage variation suggests that structurally based ornamentation is pushed towards extreme expression of the trait as predicted by the sexual selection theory. The 'bluest'birds have the highest percentage of blue feathers on the body. These ornamental feathers reflect light maximally at the shortest wavelengths (ultraviolet), with the greatest intensity and the greatest contrast. Age may have some effect on expression of blueness. In addition, plumage variables are correlated with growth bars in tail feathers (a record of nutritional condition during moult in a non–ornamental trait). This suggests that the ornament is partially condition dependent. Thus, blue plumage in male grosbeaks may serve as an honest indicator of age and quality.",W1984831267,False,0.6261221170425415

Among birds of similar age and condition, males' bills tend to be redder and darker than those of females, but there is overlap in the phenotypic expression of the sexes. The bills of young birds are paler and less red than those of older birds. There is also interindividual variation within age and sex class. Experiments were performed to measure heterosexual and isosexual (= same sex) preferences of finches. Females preferred to associate with males with the reddest, brightest bills; they even preferred males whose bills were exaggerated through color applications of non‐toxic marking pen. Males preferred to associate with females with bill colors in the middle of the phenotypic range. Females thus have “directional” preferences for male bill color, whereas male preference is “stabilizing” with regard to female bill color. In isosexual tests, neither sex showed a consistent preference for particular bill colors. Both sexes, however, displayed a tendency toward individual variability in preference. Bill color appears to be more important in heterosexual than in isosexual interactions. Several authors have recently suggested that organisms prefer brightly colored mates because bright coloration indicates superior physical condition. Results reported here do not support this hypothesis. Alternative functional explanations for the observed preferences are that bill color signals mating status, age or reproductive value. None of these appears to be a cogent explanation for the trends. Preferences do not appear to result from sexual imprinting. The possibility that the preferences are aesthetic and non‐functional is discussed.",W1998848930,False,0.4290650486946106

Testosterone titers were measured after courtship tests in male Zebra Finches to determine whether these levels are influenced by sexual behaviour. The results show that immediately after a courtship test there is a significant difference in hormone levels between sexually experienced and inexperienced birds. Sexual experience can also be shown to influence baseline testosterone titers in male Zebra Finches: experienced ♂♂ have a high baseline level while inexperienced ♂♂ have a low baseline level. In two other behaviour patterns, undirected song and courtship song, it could be demonstrated, that the amount of these behaviours shown is linearly correlated with the amount of testosterone in the blood plasma. Both song types have different hormonal threshold values. The comparison of testosterone titers between different treatment groups can only be made if the groups are maintained under identical conditions, since housing conditions appear to have a very marked influence on testosterone titers. The mechanism of action of testosterone in sexual behaviour is discussed.",W1567081332,False,0.06061302870512009

Furthermore, for E and T (but not for P4) at comparable times, there is an inverse relationship between the size of the follicle and the concentration of these hormones. Shortly beforeovulation all three steroids peak in synchrony, at other times only E and T rise and fall togetherwhile P4 shows no change. The question arose whether similar changes in steroid synthesis can beproduced by exogenous LH. A single injection of 25 µg of ovine LH was given to laying hens at a time of the laying cycle when no natural peaks of the steroidsare seen. The hens were killed at 5,30, or 90 min after injection and the walls of the three largest follicles as well as the plasmaofthese hens were assayed by RIA for P4, T, and E. Both the follicle walls and the plasma showed highly significant (P < 0.005) increases in T and P4 but not in E, even though E does show significant changes during the normal cycleThe reason for this difference in response of the steroids is being investigated. The 3 largest follicles respond to exogenous LH in the same size order as dountreated hens during the cycle. The conclusion is drawn that peaks of T and P4 normally seen are due to endogenous releases of LH while E seems to be controlled differently.

On the influence of natural selection on the variability and correlation of organs,"At an earlier stage in the development of the statistical theory of evolution it was suggested that the coefficient of correlation (Galton’s function) might be found constant for all races of the same species—in fact, it was considered possible that this coefficient might be the long-sought-for criterion of identity in species. Professor Weldon, following up this suggestion of Mr. Galton’s, then made the elaborate series of measurements on crabs with which his name will always be closely associated. To a first approximation these researches seemed to confirm the possibility of Galton’s function being a true criterion of species. When, however, a finer mathematical test was applied to Professor Weldon’s observations as well as to other statistical series for organs in man,* it became clear that the coefficient of correlation varied from local race to local race, and could not be used as a criterion of species. A slight investigation undertaken in the summer of 1896 convinced me that the coefficient of correlation between any two organs, is just as much peculiar and characteristic of a local race as the means and variations of those organs. In fact, if local races be the outcome of natural selection, then their coefficients of correlation must in general differ. The object of the present paper is to show, not only that natural selection must determine the amount of correlation, but that it is probably the chief factor in the production of correlation. If selection, natural or artificial, be capable of producing correlation, then it seems impossible to regard all correlation as evidence of a causal nexus, although the converse proposition that all causal nexus denotes correlation, is undoubtedly the most philosophical method of regarding causality. In dealing with the influence of selection on correlation, I shall suppose the distribution of complex groups of organs to follow the normal correlation surface—the generalised Gaussian law of frequency. I shall further assume the selection surfaces to be normal in character. Neither of these assumptions is absolutely true, but the Gaussian law in a good many cases describes the frequency sufficiently closely to enable us to obtain fair numerical results by its application. Probably in all cases it will enable us to reach qualitative if not accurate quantitative theoretical deductions. I have the less hesitation in asserting this, as Mr. G. U. Yule has recently succeeded in deducing the chief formulæ for correlation and regression as given by the Gaussian law from general principles, which make no appeal to a special law of frequency.",W1971465187,False,0.33139219880104065
,Sex and evolution.,"This book explores the relationship between various types of reproduction and the evolutionary process. Starting with the concept of meiosis, George C. Williams states the conditions under which an organism with both sexual and asexual reproductive capacities will employ each mode. He argues that in low-fecundity higher organisms, sexual reproduction is generally maladaptive, and persists because there is no ready means of developing an asexual alternative. The book then considers the evolutionary development of diverse forms of sexuality, such as anisogamy, hermaphroditism. and the evolution of differences between males and females in reproductive strategy.

Even in the absence of genetic instability, rapid evolution can result from an interaction of natural and sexual selection with random genetic drift along lines of equilibria.

Evidence from those fishes inhabiting Caribbean reefs indicates that eye ornamentation is much more common than their obliteration; this is probably due mainly to the ease with which reef fishes can avoid predators and the importance of the eyes as signals in intraspecific interactions. The similarities between eye ornamentation of these fishes and the concept of poster‐coloration are discussed.

https://doi.org/10.1093/auk/96.1.78,Social Status Signaling in Winter Flocking Birds: An Examination of a Current Hypothesis,"-S. Rohwer recently has proposed that intraspecific plumage variability in winter flocking birds represents a polymorphism that functions to signal social status. We test several predictions of Rohwer's status signaling hypothesis for Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis), explore some theoretical implications of our findings for juncos, and discuss the generality of social status signaling. Both darkness of hood and whiteness of tail were positively, although imperfectly, associated with social rank in captive winter flocks of first-year juncos. If plumage differences function as cues to dominance status in this species, our results suggest that their signal value derives primarily from learned associations between plumage attributes and other variables (such as sex or body size) that might influence fighting ability. Ultimate factors possibly responsible for winter plumage variability in juncos, both within and between age/sex classes, appear to be complex; selective pressure for a system of social status advertisement could (but need not) be one of these factors. Findings for some other winter flocking species reveal both similarities to, and differences from, our results for juncos. We suggest that more information on the behavior and ecology of a variety of winter flocking birds is needed before a satisfactory generalized model of social status signaling can be formulated-if such a model is possible. Received 28 February 1978, accepted 5 September 1978. FLOCKING is a widespread phenomenon among birds that winter in temperate regions. Such behavior affords many benefits; for instance, it may facilitate orientation during migration or refuging, aid in the location and efficient exploitation of food, and assist in the detection and mobbing of predators. However, flocking also may impose costs, not the least of which is the promotion of intraspecific competition for essential resources.

,Testosterone and Aggression in Birds,"The familiar spring sound of birdsongs heralds the onset of territory formation and a complex sequence of interrelated events that make up the breeding period. Such songs are an integral part of the repertoire of aggressive behaviors that males use to advertise and defend territorial boundaries and to attract mates (Fig. 1). It is well established that hormones, particularly testosterone, have stimulatory effects on aggression in reproductive contexts. The prevailing challenge hy pothesis asserts that testosterone and aggression corre late only during periods of heightened interactions be tween males. Under more stable social conditions, according to the hypothesis, relation ships among males are maintained by other factors such as social inertia, individual recognition of status, and territorial boundaries, and testoster one levels remain low. Recent re search has suggested ways in which the hypothesis should be modified or extended. In this article we will con_ sider the complexities of aggressive behaviors and their regulation, focusing specifically on species differences in territorial behavior of male birds as models for the multiple interactions of hormones, envi ronment, and behavior. The secretion of testosterone by interstitial cells in the testis is controlled primarily by a glycoprotein, luteinizing hormone, secreted from the anterior pituitary gland (Fig. 2). Testosterone stimulates the development of secondary sex characteristics such as wattles, combs, spurs, the cloacal protuberance (a copulatory organ), and",W1536375613,False,0.7297980785369873

,Continental Conservation: scientific foundations of regional reserve networks,"The Wildlands Project is a far-reaching effort by scientists and activists to develop better ways of protecting nature, wilderness, and biodiversity. Its ultimate goal is to establish an effective network of nature reserves throughout North America -- core conservation areas linked by corridors, and buffered, where appropriate, by lands that may also serve economic objectives.Continental Conservation represents the work of thirty leading experts-including Michael Soule, John Terborgh, Reed Noss, Paul Paquet, Dan Simberloff, Rodolfo Dirzo, J. Michael Scott, Andrew Dobson, and others -- brought together by The Wildlands Project to examine the science underlying the design and management of these regional-scale networks. It provides conservationists and biologists with the latest scientific principles for protecting living nature at spatial scales that encompass entire regions and continents.Following an opening chapter that sets the stage by introducing major themes and the scientific and policy background, the contributors: consider scale in the identification, selection, and design of biological reserves examine the role of top carnivores in regulating terrestrial ecosystems suggest the need for a paradigm shift in the field of ecological restoration consider the scientific details of implementing regional conservation in core areas, corridors, and in buffer zones discuss the need for megareserves and how to design themThe book ends by challenging the reader, whether scientist or advocate, to commit more time to the effort of saving nature. The authors argue that the very survival of nature is at stake, and scientists can no longer afford to stand behind a wall of austereobjectivity.Continental Conservation is an important guidebook that can serve a vital role in helping fashion a radically honest, scientifically rigorous land-use agenda.

The PHJV Assessment was designed to evaluate biological assumptions and effectiveness of PHJV conservation activities. Our objectives were to 1) test whether waterfowl reproductive success increased in response to the full suite of PHJV habitat treatments, and 2) quantify the relationships between mallard ( Anas platyrhynchos ) vital rates and landscape variables. We focused on examining the association of mallard vital rates with covariates measured at the study‐area scale. We collected information on vital rates from 3,214 radio‐marked female mallards at 27 study areas mainly throughout the Aspen Parkland ecoregion of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta in 1993–2000. We used a modeling framework and information‐theoretic techniques to test hypotheses about putative effects of environmental covariates on adult female and duckling survival, nesting effort, and nest survival. Additionally, we constructed a stage‐based matrix projection model of mallard population growth ( λ ) to estimate the sensitivities of population growth rates to variation in vital rates. Nest survival was positively related to the amount of herbaceous vegetation on study areas and total precipitation for the 12 months prior to nesting. Nesting effort was positively related to wetland inundation in July. Duckling survival was positively related to the proportion of seasonal wetlands holding water in July and negatively related to the number of days in June and July when the minimum air temperature dropped below 10° C. Adult female survival rate was positively related to both the proportions of grassland and wetland habitats measured at the study‐area scale (65 km 2 ), though these factors interacted such that the positive relationship with proportion of wetlands was strongest on study sites with high proportions of grassland. The stage‐based projection model constructed using mean vital rates indicated that populations were declining (mean λ = 0.95, median λ = 0.98, 5th percentile = 0.68, 95th percentile = 1.38). Variance‐stabilized sensitivities indicated that population growth was most responsive to variation in vital rates for after‐second‐year birds and that nest survival was the single vital rate to which populations were most sensitive. A prospective simulation revealed that, as expected, sensitivity to nest survival is likely to decrease at higher levels of nest survival. Despite evidence that nest survival was higher in PHJV habitat treatments than surrounding habitats, our a priori PHJV treatment index was unrelated to mallard vital rates estimated at the 65‐km 2 scale. Although mallard populations were affected by several weather variables and land uses, efforts to increase populations should focus on improving nest survival rates, which currently are below approximately 30%. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.",W1577177416,False,0.8969363570213318

It may be noticed that on May 9th a fair number of burrows were treated which were missed on the previous day. Undoubtedly a few burrows were overlooked nevertheless. Twelve woodchucks were observed in the 100acre area from May 7 to 9. None were seen on the last day of treatment. On May 23 the 18.6-acre field was revisited, and four burrows were found to be opened up, two of which indicated recent burrowing activities of woodchucks. No woodchucks were sighted. Nine recently used burrow systems and one woodchuck were noticed on July 11, and eleven burrow systems were in use on July 23 (Fig. 2). This means that more than one-third of the burrows were opened up again. The field was plowed up immediately after July 23. A visit on September 26 disclosed that none of the burrows which had been plowed down were opened up. However, there were indications of possible use in three burrows situated along the fences. The three visits made after the control experiment was discontinued indicate relatively high woodchuck activity. There are two possible explanations for this: first, that a relatively rapid influx took place from the surrounding fields which were not controlled; and second, that a certain number of woodchucks survived treatment. This second alternative seems to us improbable. Considering the size of the area treated, we feel that it would not take the average woodchuck very much time to infiltrate into the center field. Whatever the causes for woodchuck activity during late May and July may be, the results do not appear to be satisfactory. This implies the need for more controlled experiments and for more fundamental knowledge of the biology of the species. In total, 40 man hours were spent on the project. Since an ordinary control operation requires only one man, and since a fourth visit, such as we made on May 10, may not be necessary under average conditions, we estimate that one man could have done the operation in about 24 hours. If the average farmer earns $1.00 per hour, this would amount to $24.00. One hundred and sixty-six cartridges, selling at $0.065 each, would cost $10.78. The total expenditure for the operation would therefore be about $34.78, or approximately $0.35 per acre. Considering the results obtained, it is doubtful that this investment is warranted except in areas of valuable truck crops, orchards, etc.",W2333411156,False,0.773683488368988

,Assessment of nasal marker materials and designs used on dabbling ducks,"Four examples illustrate the relative performance of the shortcut estimator (Table 1). If the maximum-likelihood estimate provides the standard against which the others are judged, we see that the shortcut method provides similar values, but not quite as close as the Mayfield estimator. The apparent rate of nest success is the most severely biased. We recommend that the maximum-likelihood or Mayfield method be used whenever feasible (see Klett and Johnson [1982] for other suggestions and Bart and Robson [1982] for sample size considerations). The apparent rate of nest success should be avoided except under unusual circumstances in which successful and unsuccessful nests are equally likely to be found. The shortcut method proposed here is a useful approximation for quick and dirty analyses, when detailed data on all nests are not available, or as a check on the calculation of Mayfield estimates. Only the age of each nest when found and its ultimate fate are needed to calculate this new estimator. Acknowledgments.-We appreciate comments on an earlier draft of this article by J. Bart, H. F.

Several terms are erroneously used interchangeably when referring to such computer‐intensive statistical methods, including ‘resampling techniques’, ‘Monte Carlo’, ‘permutation’, ‘randomization’ and ‘bootstrap’. These techniques are not interchangeable but are fundamentally different in terms of their statistical mechanics. The generic terms ‘resampling techniques’ and ‘computer‐intensive methods’ refer to all methods in which the observed data are used to generate a reference distribution by means of randomization. This reference distribution is then used to assess the significance of a statistic calculated from the observed (not randomized) data. Significance is evaluated under the assumption that the statistic computed using the observed data is sampled from the reference distribution generated with a randomization technique.",W1523924842,False,0.15227515995502472
,Resampling: The New Statistics,"Julian L. Simon, Resampling: The New Statistics, Arlington, VA: Resampling Stats. Inc., 1992, pp. 261. Familiarity with statistical concepts if not competence with statistical procedures and their application is a requirement in most university business programs and increasingly necessary in business practice and research. This large student market ensures an abundance of texts on probability and statistics. The approaches of various statistics texts vary widely resulting from attempts to serve different needs and abilities of both students and instructors. Some books are general while others are theoretical and laden with mathematical formula while others stress applications and problem-solving. Some require no mathematical background, while others assume knowledge of probability, algebra, or even calculus. Increasingly texts are accompanied by statistical software that can be used by students to minimize the computational burden in problem-solving. Resampling: The New Statistics by Julian Simon defies easy categorization. It is a basic non-mathematical introduction to topics typically found in an introductory probability and statistics, elementary probability theory, sampling, inferential statistics, hypothesis testing and simple correlation. But this book differs significantly from the approaches of traditional texts. Rather than present derivations of formula, the presentation is based on the concept that simulation of problems and repeated sampling (resampling) will intuitively lead students to an understanding of difficult statistical concepts. The author contends that derivations and proofs are too difficult for many students to understand and get in the way of an appreciation of the value of statistics. The general procedure is to structure each problem in such a way that it can be simulated using some random device--either a die, a coin, or random number generator--and then generate enough repeated samples to result in a reliable estimate of the answer. For example, what is more likely, a poker hand with two pairs or one with three of a kind? The traditional approach would be to derive the answer analytically from a formula. The approach of Simon is to take repeated samples of poker hands and compare the proportion with two of a kind to that with three of a kind. Again the premise is that the answer obtained this way will be sufficiently close to the derived answer and students will gain greater understanding of the underlying concept. Of course, repeated sampling can be cumbersome and time-consuming. The text is designed to accompany software which enables numerous random trials to be performed quickly and the results tabulated. The book is conceptually but not explicitly divided into two parts. Chapters one, two, and three introduce the uses of probability and statistics, describe the resampling method of solving problems, and define basic concepts such as conditional and unconditional probability, sample and universe, and independent events. …",W1511364348,False,0.8756275177001953

Here, we use randomization methods with circular statistics to test for synchrony and seasonality of reproduction in three species of nectarivorous megachiropteran bats on Negros Island in the central Philippines. In Rousettus amplexicaudatus, estimated dates of birth were both highly synchronous and highly seasonal. In Macroglossus minimus, estimated births were seasonal and significantly clustered within years, but within each year births occurred over a broad period, indicating a low level of synchrony. In Eonycteris spelaea, estimated births were also seasonal and had statistically significant synchrony, with birth periods within years intermediate in synchrony between R. amplexicaudatus and M. minimus. All three species had a similar seasonal pattern, with two birth periods in each year, centered on March or April and August or September. In one species, R. amplexicaudatus, primigravid females (in their first pregnancy) produced their young in June and July, a birth period significantly different in timing from the two birth periods of older adult females. This more conservative pattern of young females may allow higher survival of parents and offspring at cost of a lost reproductive opportunity. There was weak evidence that in some years primigravid females of M. minimus might differ in timing from older adults. There were few significant differences in reproductive timing among different years, and those differences were generally less than two weeks, even during a severe drought in the severe el Niño of 1983. The results suggest that these species follow an obligately seasonal pattern of reproductive timing with very little phenotypic plasticity. The resampling methods were sensitive to differences in timing of under two weeks, in some cases, suggesting that these are useful methods for analyses of seasonality in wild populations of bats.",W1495133183,False,0.8721976280212402

Histological examination of these samples indicated that females became pregnant in July or August, and young were born in late November or early December. The testes and epididymides were small from September to mid-April, increased threefold in weight between mid-April and late May, reached a peak weight in July, and decreased in weight in August. Spermatogenesis occurred throughout the testes of males captured from May to August. In 1990, the timing of parturition in females that gave birth in the laboratory to young conceived in the wild was similar to the timing in the field in 1984-1985. Groups of 10-13 males were subjected in the laboratory to (i) a gradually changing, civil twilight photoperiod that mimicked the natural cycle of annual change at 10 degrees N latitude, (ii) the same gradually changing cycle of photoperiod accelerated to a six-month period, or (iii) a constant photoperiod (light 12:54 h: dark 11:06 h). These treatments began in mid-December, four months before the initiation of testicular recrudescence in the wild. In all three groups, testicular volume remained low until April, and then increased two- to threefold between late April and late June, rising to a peak in July, as occurred in the wild.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",W1966622249,False,0.7952980995178223

A common procedure in the regression analysis of interspecies data is to first test the independent and dependent variables X and Y for phylogenetic signal, and then use the presence of signal in one or both traits to justify regression analysis using phylogenetic methods such as independent contrasts or phylogenetic generalized least squares. 2. This is incorrect, because phylogenetic regression assumes that the residual error in the regression model (not in the original traits) is distributed according to a multivariate normal distribution with variances and covariances proportional to the historical relations of the species in the sample. 3. Here, I examine the consequences of justifying and applying the phylogenetic regression incorrectly. I find that when used improperly the phylogenetic regression can have poor statistical performance, even under some circumstances in which the type I error rate of the method is not inflated over its nominal level. 4.

This method has been practised by biologists since Aristotle, but it has never been developed to be as rigorous as the experimental method. The first half of this book attempts to show how the comparative method can be improved if only independent trials of evolutionary hypotheses are counted. The techniques of cladistic taxonomy can be used to recognize these independent evolutionary events. The second half of the book applies these methods to two questions about sexual behaviour: precopulatory mate guarding, and homogamy of size. In so doing the mating habits of groups not previously reviewed are considered - crustacea and arachnids.",W1601231658,False,0.13796132802963257

Data were recorded monthly between 1982 and 1992 across 23 sites that comprise a variety of local environmental conditions and disturbance histories. Flowering periodicity and intensity were highly variable between species and sites, ranging from annual flowering to no flowering over the 10‐year period. Cool temperatures prior to floral budding was a strong predictor of flowering for nine species. Extraordinary climatic events also influenced flowering. The period of greatest flowering for all species combined occurred 9 months after the highest monthly rainfall recorded in the survey (March 1985). An 18‐month extreme drought led to poor flowering in Corymbia variegata, Eucalyptus acmenoides, Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus resinifera, but recovery after the drought broke was rapid. In contrast to climate, few site‐based environmental variables explained the intersite variation in flowering performance of the tree species. Site disturbance from logging at two sites during the survey did not influence flowering in the remaining canopy over following years. No species showed a negative correlation with a history of recent logging, and direct comparisons, between large‐ and medium‐sized trees, of the percentage of foliage in flower showed no differences for any species. At the scale of a timber production forest, the negligible effect of tree size (if &gt;10 cm diameter at breast height over bark), and high stem density resulting from selective logging, leave about half of the net harvestable area producing flowers at a similar density to unlogged forest. However, larger trees flowered more frequently than medium‐sized trees in C. variegata (medium: every 5.9 years; large: every 2.3 years) and there was a trend in this direction for 13 of 17 species. Low‐intensity burns and wildfires caused differing amounts of crown scorch, sometimes resulting in bud loss, but most species flowered at prefire levels 1–3 years after the disturbance. Eucalyptus microcorys and Angophora costata flowered poorly at sites that experienced frequent low‐intensity burns. Regionally, blossom shortages occur through a combination of spatial and temporal patchiness in flowering and the clearing of those species that occurred on soils preferred for agriculture. On the north coast of NSW, these shortages commonly occur from late winter to spring. Species that flower reliably in this period include Eucalyptus robusta, Eucalyptus tereticornis and Eucalyptus siderophloia in late winter and E. siderophloia and E. acmenoides in spring.",W1938348276,False,0.7917336225509644

A blocker of organic anion transport reveals that these processes occur via a membrane transport system for organic anions.,"Fura-2, loaded into J774.2 macrophages as the acetoxymethyl ester, is sequestered into intracellular vacuoles within 90 min after the beginning of the loading at 37 degrees C. The dye is also efficiently secreted from the cells. Sequestration and secretion of fura-2 reduce the accuracy of measurements of cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in this cell line. Fura-2 is also sequestered and secreted by J774.2 when the dye is loaded into the cytoplasm as the pentapotassium salt by reversible permeabilization of the plasma membrane. Regardless of the mechanism by which fura-2 is loaded into the cytoplasm, both sequestration and secretion are prevented by 2.5 mM probenecid, a blocker of organic anion transport. Probenecid has no effect on resting or stimulated cytosolic free Ca2+ levels or on FcR-mediated phagocytosis. These findings suggest that macrophages express a transport mechanism for the anionic form of fura-2. This transport system is responsible for the clearance of fura-2 from the cytoplasm of this cell type. Furthermore we suggest that use of probenecid to block secretion and intracellular sequestration of fura-2 may overcome problems arising in the application of this Ca2+ indicator to macrophages and perhaps to other cell types.",W1557163873,False,0.04299475625157356
https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.110.12.1387,Calcium ion dependency and the role of inositol phosphates in melatonin-induced encystment of dinoflagellates,"ABSTRACT The unicellular eukaryotic dinoflagellates shed their flagella and form a new pellicle cyst wall in response to environmental stress. This encystment process can also be induced by indoleamines such as melatonin and 5-methoxytryptamine. To decipher the complex signaling events which lead to encystment, we have investigated the functional roles of Ca2+ and inositol phosphates in indoleamine-induced encystment of the dinoflagellates Alexandrium catenella and Crypthecodinium cohnii. Pretreatment with EGTA, but not with EDTA, effectively blocked the indoleamine-induced encystment of A. catenella in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, agents that facilitate the influx of Ca2+ (Bay K 8644, A23187 and ionomycin) dose-dependently induced encystment of A. catenella. Endoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase inhibitors such as thapsigargin and the peptide toxin melittin also induced encystment of A. catenella. These results suggest that an elevation of intracellular [Ca2+] may be involved in the encystment response. In terms of the regulation of phospholipase C, melatonin doseand time-dependently stimulated the formation of inositol phosphates in C. cohnii. The rank order of potency for several indoleamines to stimulate inositol phosphates formation was 2-iodomelatonin &amp;gt; 5-methoxytryptamine ≥ melatonin &amp;gt;&amp;gt; N-acetylserotonin &amp;gt; 5-hydroxytryptamine. This rank order was the same as for the indoleamine-induced encystment of C. cohnii as previously reported. Our results indicate that indoleamineinduced activation of phospholipase C and elevation of intracellular [Ca2+] may be proximal steps in the signal transduction pathway leading to encystment in dinoflagellates. Moreover, this is the first demonstration of the possible involvement of Ca2+ and inositol phosphates as second messengers in dinoflagellates.",W1958159270,False,0.07342079281806946

Mutational activation and coupling to receptors and phospholipase C.,"Gq mediates hormonal stimulation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). We mutated the alpha subunit of Gq (alpha q) to replace arginine 183 with cysteine. Mutations that substitute cysteine for the corresponding arginine residues of alpha s and alpha i2 constitutively activate their respective effector pathways, creating the gsp and gip2 oncogenes. Transient expression of alpha q-R183C in COS-7 and HEK-293 cells constitutively activates PI-PLC, but wild type (WT) alpha q does not. This suggests that the mutated arginines in alpha s, alpha i2, and alpha q share a common function in regulating the active state of these proteins and that the alpha q gene may serve as a target for oncogenic mutations in human tumors. In an attempt to develop an assay for receptor stimulation of recombinant alpha q, we co-expressed receptors with alpha q-WT. We found that the alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulates PI-PLC activation in HEK-293 cells in a fashion that depends completely on co-expression of alpha q-WT. These findings create an experimental model, similar to that provided for alpha s by S49 cyc- cells, that should make it possible to analyze receptor and effector coupling by mutant alpha q against a null background.",W1504432233,False,0.0009774118661880493

Arthropods, particularly insects, make ideal subjects for such a study because their generation times are characteristically short and many have relatively discrete generations, inviting the use of difference equation models to describe population changes. Using analytical models framed in difference equations, Dr. Hassell is able to show how the detailed biological processes of insect predator-prey (including host-parasitoid) interactions may be understood. Emphasizing the development and subsequent stability analysis of general models, the author considers in detail several crucial components of predator-prey models: the prey's rate of increase as a function of density, non-random search, mutual interference, and the predator's rate of increase as a function of predator survival and fecundity. Drawing on the correspondence between the models and field and laboratory data, Dr. Hassell then discusses the practical implications for biological pest control and suggests how such models may help to formulate a theoretical basis for biological control practices.",W1986197266,False,0.29892513155937195

NA “turns on” near dawn and “turns off” near dusk, independent of photic conditions. Chloramphenicol (CAP) and ammonium prevented turn on of NA in T. thiebautii when added to samples collected before dawn but were progressively less effective in inhibiting NA in samples collected later in the morning. In samples collected after turn on, activities declined with time with both CAP and ammonium treatments, with ammonium having a stronger effect. In contrast, CAP added to samples collected in late afternoon prolonged NA, compared with controls, which turned off. Direct analysis of the presence of the Fe protein of nitrogenase in T. thiebautii by using a Western immunoblot procedure found a strong protein band present in samples collected after 0800 h through the late evening but little or no Fe protein in samples collected within the 2 to 4 h preceding dawn. We conclude that the diel cycle of NA in T. thiebautii results from de novo synthesis of nitrogenase each morning and from the inactivation and degradation of nitrogenase in the late afternoon and night.",W1855293024,False,0.8770802021026611

Additions of 1 μM glu, gln, NO 3 −, or NH 4 + did not affect short‐term rates of N 2 fixation. This may be an important factor that allows for continued N 2 fixation in oligotrophic areas where recycling processes are active. N 2 fixation rates decreased when nutrients were supplied at higher concentrations (e.g. 10 μM). Uptake of combined N (NH 4 +, NO 3 −, and amino acids) by Trichodesmium was stimulated by increased concentrations. For NO 3 −, proportional increases in NO 3 − uptake and decreases in N 2 fixation were observed when additions were made to cultures before the onset of the light period. GS activity did not change much in response to the addition of NH 4 +, NO 3 −, glu, or gln. GS is necessary for N metabolism, and the bulk of this enzyme pool may be conserved. Intracellular pools of glu and gln varied in response to 10 μM additions of NH 4 +, glu, or gln. Cells incubated with NH 4 + became depleted in intracellular glu and enriched with intracellular gln. The increase in the gln/glu ratio corresponded to a decrease in the rate of N 2 fixation. Although the gln/glu ratio decreased in cells exposed to the amino acids, there was only a corresponding decrease in N 2 fixation after the gln addition. The results presented here suggest that combined N concentrations on the order of 1 μM do not affect rates of N 2 fixation and metabolism, although higher concentrations (e.g. 10 μM) can. Moreover, these effects are exerted through products of NH 4 + assimilation rather than exogenous N, as has been suggested for other species. These results may help explain how cultures of Trichodesmium are able to simultaneously fix N 2 and take up NH 4 + and how natural populations continue to fix N 2 once combined N concentrations increase within a bloom.",W1980889743,False,0.8328975439071655

High concentrations of glutamate and glutamine were found in colonies. Glutamate and glutamine uptake rates and concentrations in cells were low in the early morning and increased in the late morning to reach maxima near midday; then uptake and concentration again fell to low values. This pattern followed that previously observed for T. thiebautii nitrogenase activity. Our results suggest that recently fixed nitrogen is incorporated into glutamine in the N2-fixing trichomes and may be passed as glutamate to non-N2-fixing trichomes. The high transport rates and concentrations of glutamate may explain the previously observed absence of appreciable uptake of NH4+, NO3-, or urea by Trichodesmium spp. Immunolocalization, Western blots (immunoblots), and enzymatic assays indicated that glutamine synthetase (GS) was present in all cells during both day and night. GS appeared to be primarily contained in cells of T. thiebautii rather than in associated bacteria or cyanobacteria. Double immunolabeling showed that cells with nitrogenase (Fe protein) contained levels of the GS protein that were twofold higher than those in cells with little or no nitrogenase. GS activity and the uptake of glutamine and glutamate dramatically decreased in the presence of the GS inhibitor methionine sulfoximine. Since no glutamate dehydrogenase activity was detected in this species, GS appears to be the primary enzyme responsible for NH3 incorporation.",W1498939565,False,0.7491840720176697

A newly developed assay for quantitation of total phages, employing direct electron microscopic counts, was used in conjunction with the plaque assay. The total concentration of phages was significantly higher in reactor mixed liquor and effluent than in influent sewage, indicating a net production of phages within the reactor. Maximum total phage concentrations in the fluid phase of sewage, activated-sludge mixed liquor, and reactor effluent were 2.2 × 10 7, 9.5 × 10 7, and 8.4 × 10 7 /ml, respectively. Conditions were optimized for isolation of predominant heterotrophic aerobic bacteria from sewage and mixed liquor. Blending at ice water temperatures was superior to ultrasound or enzyme treatments for maximum release of viable bacteria from microbial floc. A solidified extract of mixed liquor was superior to standard media for cultivating maximum numbers of heterotrophic bacteria.

By differential centrifugation and ultrafiltration, phage particles were separated and concentrated from ruminal fluid. Linear double-stranded DNA from this fraction containing predominantly tailed phage was isolated and separated by size, using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Laser densitometry of gel photographs allowed the numbers of phages with DNA in each size region to be calculated and, therefore, the total numbers per milliliter of ruminal fluid to be estimated. Phage numbers were estimated to be between 3 x 10(9) and 1.6 x 10(10) particles ml of ruminal fluid-1. The phage population, as gauged by the appearance of DNA on PFGE gels, had two major components. A broad region of DNA between 30 and 200 kb was always present on PFGE gels. It appears this region comprises DNA from a great many different phages and would include most of the temperate phages. In addition, discrete DNA bands ranging in size from 10 to 850 kb were frequently observed. DNA from one such band, of 12 kb in size, was shown to consist primarily of a single DNA type, suggesting that it originated from a specific phage. It is postulated that the discrete bands are due to epidemics or blooms of phage activity from specific, probably lytic, phages.

Harvesting mature individuals displaces the reaction norm for age and size at maturation toward older ages and larger sizes and rotates it clockwise, whereas harvesting immature individuals has the reverse qualitative effect. If both immature and mature individuals are harvested, the net effect has approximately the same trend as when harvesting immature individuals only. This stems from the sensitivity of the evolutionary response, which depends on the maturity state of harvested individuals, but also on the type of harvest mortality (negatively or positively density dependent, density independent) and the value of three life–history parameters (natural mortality, growth rate and the trade–off between growth and reproduction). Evolutionary changes in the maturation reaction norm have strong repercussions for the mean size and the density of harvested individuals that, in most cases, result in the reduction of biomass—a response that population dynamical models would overlook. These results highlight the importance of accounting for evolutionary trends in the long–term management of exploited living resources and give qualitative insights into how to minimize the detrimental consequences of harvest–induced evolutionary changes in maturation reaction norms.",W1969198586,False,0.7158933877944946

When Darwin developed the theory of evolution by natural selection, practically nothing was known of hereditary differences beyond their existence. Since 1900, a body of knowledge on the mechanism of heredity and on mutation has been built up by experiment that challenges any field in the biological sciences in the extent and precision of its results. The implications for evolution are not, however, immediately obvious. I t is necessary to work out the statistical consequences. Studies in the field of statistical genetics began shortly after the rediscovery of Mendelian heredity in 1900. Those of J. B. S. Haldane [7] and R. A. Fisher [4] have been especially important with respect to the application to evolution. My own approach to the subject came through experimental studies conducted in the U. S. Bureau of Animal Industry on the effects of inbreeding, crossbreeding and selection on populations of guinea pigs [21, 22, 23, 37] and through the attempt to formulate principles applicable to livestock breeding [19, 20, 24, 25, 13, 34]. On moving into the more academic atmosphere of the University of Chicago, I have become more directly concerned with the problem of evolution. I should note that the deductive approach, to which I shall confine myself here, involves many questions that can only be settled by observation and experimental work on natural populations and that a remarkable resurgence of interest in such work is in progress [2, 9].",W1970592097,False,0.08286483585834503

Heme A(S) was isolated from cytochrome oxidases of the thermoacidophilic archaeon, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. Heme A(S) has the same spectroscopic features as heme A but has a hydroxyethylgeranylgeranyl side chain instead of the hydroxyethylfarnesyl group. This variant is also present in other archaeal oxidases as well as in the cytochrome oxidases of a thermophilic eubacterium. Other archaea (Thermoplasma, Pyrobaculum) were also shown to have cytochrome oxidases. From these organisms, three novel prenylated heme variants (called OT, OP1, and OP2) were isolated. They are structurally related to heme O; OP2 has a hydroxyethylgeranylgeranyl instead of the hydroxyethylfarnesyl side chain. In OP1 and OT, the hydroxyethylprenyl group is altered to ethenylprenyl by elimination of a water molecule. Most probably, the novel hemes are cofactors binding to the binuclear reaction centers of archaeal cytochrome oxidases.",W1585551835,False,0.08437466621398926

The nap operon is unusual in lacking napC (encoding a tetra‐haem c ‐type cytochrome) and napF, but contains a novel gene of unknown function, napL. The iron‐sulphur protein NapG has a major role in electron transfer to the NapAB complex, but we show that slow nitrate‐dependent growth of a napG mutant can be sustained by electron transfer from NrfH, the electron donor to the nitrite reductase NrfA. A napL mutant possessed ∼50% lower NapA activity than the wild type but showed normal growth with nitrate as the electron acceptor. NrfA was constitutive and was shown to play a role in protection against nitrosative stress in addition to the previously identified NO‐inducible single domain globin, Cgb. However, nitrite also induced cgb expression in an NssR‐dependent manner, suggesting that growth of C. jejuni with nitrite causes nitrosative stress. This was confirmed by lack of growth of cgb and nssR mutants, and slow growth of the nrfA mutant, in media containing nitrite. Thus, NrfA and Cgb together provide C. jejuni with constitutive and inducible components of a robust defence against nitrosative stress.",W1500585787,False,0.001553934533149004

Cells were incubated in the presence of both acetylene and NH4+. Under these conditions, the cells were unable to utilize NH4+ as an energy source. Energy to support protein synthesis was supplied by the oxidation of hydroxylamine or other alternative substrates for hydroxylamine oxidoreductase. De novo protein synthesis was detected by 14C incorporation from 14CO2 into polypeptides by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. In the presence of NH4+, acetylene-treated cells synthesized the 27-kDa polypeptide of ammonia monoxygenase (AMO) and two other major polypeptides (with sizes of 55 and 65 kDa). The synthesis of these polypeptides was completely inhibited by chloramphenicol and attenuated by rifampin. The optimal concentration of hydroxylamine for the in vivo 14C-labeling reaction was found to be 2 mM. The effect of NH4+ concentration was also examined. It was shown to cause a saturable response with a Ks of approximately 2.0 mM NH4+. Labeling studies conducted at different pH values suggest cells respond to NH3 rather than NH4+. No other compounds tested were able to influence the synthesis of the 27-kDa component of AMO, although we have also demonstrated that this polypeptide can be synthesized under anaerobic conditions in cells utilizing pyruvate- or hydrazine-dependent nitrite reduction as an energy source.

We present high‐resolution nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4 ) records measured along two ice cores from central Greenland covering part of Marine Isotope Stages 3 and 4 in the last glacial epoch. The N 2 O data confirm the hypothesis that N 2 O shows variations in phase to fast climatic changes observed in the Northern Hemisphere, the so‐called Dansgaard‐Oeschger (D‐O) events. Variations exist not only for events with a long duration (1500 years and more) but also for the shorter ones. The comparison with CH 4 unveils interesting differences between the response of CH 4 and N 2 O to D‐O events. While the average amplitudes of CH 4 oscillations associated with D‐O events are similar to those of the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation, the magnitude of the N 2 O concentration change instead correlates with the duration of the D‐O events. The records give further insight into the timing of concentration changes at the beginning of D‐O events.

Insect‐resistant transgenic plants invest some nutrients to the production of specific toxic proteins [i.e. endotoxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)], which could alter the C–N balance of these plants, especially under changed abiotic conditions. Aphids are nonsusceptible to Lepidoptera‐targeted Bt Cry1Ac toxin and they typically show response to abiotic conditions, and here we sought to discover whether they might perform differently on compositionally changed Bt oilseed rape. Bt oilseed rape had increased N content in the leaves coupled with reduced total C compared with its nontransgenic counterpart, but in general the C : N responses of both plant types to elevated CO 2 and temperature were similar. Elevated CO 2 decreased N content and increased C : N ratio of both plant types. Elevated temperature increased C and N contents, total chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations under ambient CO 2, but decreased these under elevated CO 2. In addition, soluble sugars were increased and starch decreased by elevated temperature under ambient but not under elevated CO 2, whereas photosynthesis was decreased in plants grown under elevated temperature in both CO 2 levels. Myzus persicae, a generalist aphid species, responded directly to elevated temperature with reduced developmental time and decreased adult and progeny weights, whereas the development of the Brassica specialist Brevicoryne brassicae was less affected. Feeding by M. persicae resulted in an increase in the N content of oilseed rape leaves under ambient CO 2, indicating the potential of herbivore feeding itself to cause allocation changes. The aphids performed equally well on both plant types despite the differences between C–N ratios of Bt and non‐Bt oilseed rape, revealing the absence of plant composition‐related effects on these pests under elevated CO 2, elevated temperature or combined elevated CO 2 and temperature conditions.",W1968032137,False,0.7581323385238647

The damage potential of insect pests was studied during three growing seasons in the Piedmont and coastal plain regions of Georgia by controlling insects with insecticides at the rosette, beginning bloom, or pod-fill stages of plant development. Canola pod infestations by the cabbage seedpod weevil, Ceutorhynchus assimilis Paykull, reached 60% at some sites in northern Georgia indicating that this insect will be an important pest of canola in this area. However, C. assimilis was not collected in any year in southern Georgia. Yield responses to insecticide treatments were associated with a complex of aphids, primarily the turnip aphid, Lipaphis erysimi (Kaltenbach), and green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), which caused direct injury to leaves and stems. Aphid injury reduced plant height and winter survival and delayed plant development. Comparison of untreated and season-long treated plots indicated that aphid injury reduced yield by 9.9, 30.4, and 34.8% in 3 yr in the coastal plain region. In northern Georgia, yield losses caused by aphids were ≤2.0% in three of four trials, but aphid injury reduced yield by 32.7% in one trial. Insecticidal control of aphids had the greatest effect on yield during the rosette stage with treatments at first bloom also enhancing yield in some trials. Insecticide treatments at pod-fill stage did not affect canola growth and yield in any trial. Aphids most likely will be a limiting factor in canola production in the southern United States, particularly in the coastal plain region.

To address the challenge for automated taxonomic identification of images generated by our custom‐built submersible Imaging FlowCytobot, we developed an approach that relies on extraction of image features, which are then presented to a machine learning algorithm for classification. Our approach uses a combination of image feature types including size, shape, symmetry, and texture characteristics, plus orientation invariant moments, diffraction pattern sampling, and co‐occurrence matrix statistics. Some of these features required preprocessing with image analysis techniques including edge detection after phase congruency calculations, morphological operations, boundary representation and simplification, and rotation. For the machine learning strategy, we developed an approach that combines a feature selection algorithm and use of a support vector machine specified with a rigorous parameter selection and training approach. After training, a 22‐category classifier provides 88% overall accuracy for an independent test set, with individual category accuracies ranging from 68% to 99%. We demonstrate application of this classifier to a nearly uninterrupted 2‐month time series of images acquired in Woods Hole Harbor, including use of statistical error correction to derive quantitative concentration estimates, which are shown to be unbiased with respect to manual estimates for random subsamples.

https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12000,Mixotrophy and the toxicity of <i>Ochromonas</i> in pelagic food webs,"Summary 1. Toxic compounds produced by many phytoplankton taxa are known to have negative effects on competitors (allelopathy), anti‐predatory effects on grazers (mortality or impaired reproduction) or both. Although mixotrophs of the genus Ochromonas are known to be toxic to zooplankton, it has often been assumed in studies of plankton community processes that all flagellates in the size range of this taxon are edible to typical zooplankton grazers (i.e. cells ≤30 μm for Daphnia, ≤6 μm for rotifers). 2. We explored the toxicity of a species of Ochromonas to other planktonic taxa, including its competitors (two species of phytoplankton and protists) and consumers (two species of zooplankton). To test if mode of nutrition by this mixotroph influences its toxicity to other taxa, we exposed each test species to Ochromonas cultured in chemostats under four different nutritional regimes: osmotrophy (labile dissolved organic carbon) and phagotrophy (bacterial prey) in both light and dark conditions (i.e. with or without photosynthesis). 3. Filtrate from osmotrophically fed Ochromonas had a significant negative effect on the population growth rate of two obligate phototrophic phytoplankton, Cryptomonasozolini and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The protists Tetrahymena tetrahymena and Paramecium aurelia were also negatively affected by Ochromonas filtrate. Ochromonas cells were toxic to both the rotifer Brachionus calicyflorus and the cladoceran Daphnia pulicaria, with the toxic effects significantly more severe when fed at high cell densities (75 000 cells mL −1 ) than at low densities (7500 cells mL −1 ). Ochromonas cultured osmotrophically in the light was more toxic to the Daphnia than cells cultured under other conditions. In contrast, Ochromonas from all nutritional conditions was equally highly toxic to Brachionus. 4. Our findings support the view that Ochromonas can be toxic to other components of the food web with which it interacts. It is especially toxic to zooplankton that directly consume it, although the effect depends upon Ochromonas cell density and whether or not a good food source is simultaneously present. Our results call into question the common practice of pooling flagellates into a single ‘functional group’ included in an ‘edible phytoplankton’ category of cells &lt;30 μm in diameter.",W1483137435,False,0.8788500428199768

Most ladybirds possess a dotted pattern, althougn the number, shape, and size of the spots, as well as their colour, varies considerably. Almost all ladybirds have a characteristic general appearance (body shape). We considered these traits to be used in ladybird recognition by avian predators. In the present study, we compared the reactions of avian predators (Parus major) caught in the wild, to four differently coloured ladybird beetles (Coccinella septempunctata, Exochomus quadripustulatus, Subcoccinella vigintiquatuorpunctata, and Cynegetis impunctata) and two artificial modifications of C. septempunctata; the first was deprived of their elytral spotted pattern by painting it brown, the other had their elytra removed (i.e. altering their general ladybird appearance). Ladybirds with a spotted pattern were attacked less frequently than unspotted ones. Ladybirds with removed elytra were attacked much more often than any ladybird with a preserved general appearance. The results obtained in the present study suggest the high importance of the spotted pattern as well as general appearance in the ladybird recognition process.

https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/152.3.1079,Estimation of Past Demographic Parameters From the Distribution of Pairwise Differences When the Mutation Rates Vary Among Sites: Application to Human Mitochondrial DNA,"Abstract Distributions of pairwise differences often called “mismatch distributions” have been extensively used to estimate the demographic parameters of past population expansions. However, these estimations relied on the assumption that all mutations occurring in the ancestry of a pair of genes lead to observable differences (the infinite-sites model). This mutation model may not be very realistic, especially in the case of the control region of mitochondrial DNA, where this methodology has been mostly applied. In this article, we show how to infer past demographic parameters by explicitly taking into account a finite-sites model with heterogeneity of mutation rates. We also propose an alternative way to derive confidence intervals around the estimated parameters, based on a bootstrap approach. By checking the validity of these confidence intervals by simulations, we find that only those associated with the timing of the expansion are approximately correctly estimated, while those around the population sizes are overly large. We also propose a test of the validity of the estimated demographic expansion scenario, whose proper behavior is verified by simulation. We illustrate our method with human mitochondrial DNA, where estimates of expansion times are found to be 10–20% larger when taking into account heterogeneity of mutation rates than under the infinite-sites model.",W1761250483,False,0.0272251907736063
https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/131.2.479,Analysis of molecular variance inferred from metric distances among DNA haplotypes: application to human mitochondrial DNA restriction data.,"Abstract We present here a framework for the study of molecular variation within a single species. Information on DNA haplotype divergence is incorporated into an analysis of variance format, derived from a matrix of squared-distances among all pairs of haplotypes. This analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) produces estimates of variance components and F-statistic analogs, designated here as phi-statistics, reflecting the correlation of haplotypic diversity at different levels of hierarchical subdivision. The method is flexible enough to accommodate several alternative input matrices, corresponding to different types of molecular data, as well as different types of evolutionary assumptions, without modifying the basic structure of the analysis. The significance of the variance components and phi-statistics is tested using a permutational approach, eliminating the normality assumption that is conventional for analysis of variance but inappropriate for molecular data. Application of AMOVA to human mitochondrial DNA haplotype data shows that population subdivisions are better resolved when some measure of molecular differences among haplotypes is introduced into the analysis. At the intraspecific level, however, the additional information provided by knowing the exact phylogenetic relations among haplotypes or by a nonlinear translation of restriction-site change into nucleotide diversity does not significantly modify the inferred population genetic structure. Monte Carlo studies show that site sampling does not fundamentally affect the significance of the molecular variance components. The AMOVA treatment is easily extended in several different directions and it constitutes a coherent and flexible framework for the statistical analysis of molecular data.",W1919772617,False,0.007940458133816719

https://doi.org/10.2307/1942558,Interspecific Competition Among Hawaiian Forest Birds,"The object of this study was to determine whether interspecific competition modified local geographic distribution, after taking into account the effect of habitat structure. The tendencies for 14 passerine birds to have positive or negative associations were examined, using 7861 sample points in seven native forests on the islands of Hawaii, Maui, and Kauai. All birds were at least partly insectivorous and were fairly common in forested areas, although some fed chiefly on nectar or fruit. Species—pairs were classified as primary or secondary potential competitors based on general dietary similarity. To evaluate the association between species and to account for the effect of individual species habitat preferences, partial correlations were computed for each species—pair in a study area from the simple correlations between the species and 26 habitat variables plus two quadratic terms to represent nonlinearity. The partial correlations represented a short—term (""instantaneous"") assessment of the strength of competitive interactions, and did not reflect the accumulation of competitive displacement through time. Of 170 partial correlations in the analysis, only 10 indicated significant negative association. The general pattern was of positive association (76 significantly positive partials), which probably resulted from flocking and from attraction of birds to areas of resource superabundance. Two species showed consistent patterns of negative partial correlations over several adjacent study areas, the Japanese White—eye/Iiwi in montane Hawaii, and the Japanese White—eye/Elepaio in windward Hawaii; both patterns could be reasonably attributed to direct competition. Species—pairs were grouped by the native or exotic status of the component species. Native/exotic pairs had a significantly greater proportion of negative partial correlations (37%) than either native/native pairs (8%) or exotic/exotic pairs (0%). This pattern was consistent across the seven study areas and appeared to reflect the occurrence of interspecific competition along a broad and diffuse ecological ""front"" between a co—evolved native avifauna and recently introduced exotic species. The role of competition in the pattern was corroborated by the significantly higher proportion of negative partial correlations among species—pairs of primary potential competitors than among those of secondary potential competitors. Our results suggested that °47% of the primary potential competitors among native/exotic species—pairs may experience at least small depressions in local population density due to competition. Although the negative correlations were for the most part small (average negative r = 0.06), one species could eventually replace another as spatial displacement accumulated through time. The Japanese White—eye appeared to have a principal role in native/exotic interactions, with 62% of the partial correlations between it and native primary potential competitor species being negative. Noteworthy implications were that (1) it was important to account for the habitat responses of individual species when studying the role of interspecific competition in modifying small—scale geographic distribution; (2) competition was frequently sporadic in its geographic occurrence and in the species affected, thus supporting Wiens' (1977) theory of competition; and (3) as a consequence, the role of interspecific competition in modifying distribution may be difficult to detect statistically with small data sets.",W1966764972,False,0.7113567590713501

Yet, little is known about the influence of individual traits on these emergent properties, despite the widespread use in current vegetation models of plant functional types, each of which is defined by a constellation of traits. 2. We examine the influence of four key traits (leaf economic strategy, height at maturation, wood density, and seed size) on four emergent vegetation properties (average height of leaf area, leaf‐area index, net primary productivity and biomass density). We employ a trait‐, size‐ and patch‐structured model of vegetation dynamics that allows scaling up from individual‐level growth processes and probabilistic disturbances to landscape‐level predictions. A physiological growth model incorporating relevant trade‐offs was designed and calibrated based on known empirical patterns. The resulting vegetation model naturally exhibits a range of phenomena commonly observed in vegetation dynamics. 3. We modelled single‐species stands, varying each trait over its known empirical range. Seed size had only a small effect on vegetation properties, primarily because our metapopulations were not seed‐limited. The remaining traits all had larger effects on vegetation properties, especially on biomass density. Leaf economic strategy influenced minimum light requirement, and thus total leaf area and basal area. Wood density and height at maturation influenced vegetation mainly by modifying individual stem mass. These effects of traits were maintained, and sometimes amplified, across stands differing in productivity and mean disturbance interval. 4. Synthesis : Natural trait variation can cause large differences in emergent properties of vegetation, the magnitudes of which approach those arising through changes to site productivity and disturbance frequency. Our results therefore underscore the need for next‐generation vegetation models that incorporate functional traits together with their effects on the patch and size structure of vegetation.",W1483075066,False,0.7670557498931885

A pragmatic approach for assessing the quality of functional spaces,"Abstract Aim Functional diversity is a key facet of biodiversity that is increasingly being measured to quantify its changes following disturbance and to understand its effects on ecosystem functioning. Assessing the functional diversity of assemblages based on species traits requires the building of a functional space (dendrogram or multidimensional space) where indices will be computed. However, there is still no consensus on the best method for measuring the quality of functional spaces. Innovation Here we propose a framework for evaluating the quality of a functional space (i.e. the extent to which it is a faithful representation of the initial functional trait values). Using simulated datasets, we analysed the influence of the number and type of functional traits used and of the number of species studied on the identity and quality of the best functional space. We also tested whether the quality of the functional space affects functional diversity patterns in local assemblages, using simulated datasets and a real study case. Main conclusions The quality of functional space strongly varied between situations. Spaces having at least four dimensions had the highest quality, while functional dendrograms and two‐dimensional functional spaces always had a low quality. Importantly, we showed that using a poor‐quality functional space could led to a biased assessment of functional diversity and false ecological conclusions. Therefore, we advise a pragmatic approach consisting of computing all the possible functional spaces and selecting the most parsimonious one.",W1499267374,False,0.6124482154846191

We also compare the distribution of the Cscore for the avifaunas of three archipelagoes: Bismarck Archipelago, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. The most popular “fill” algorithm, the random Knight’s Tour, produces distributional means that differ from all “swap” algorithms. Furthermore, the random Knight’s Tour produces distributions with higher variances. The Manly Swap and Gotelli Swap methods produce distributions with smaller variances than other swap algorithms.

Examination of the avifaunas of the three archipelagoes generally corroborates the results the ANOVA. The random Knight’s Tour, Manly Swap, and Gotelli Swap do not produce uniform random samples.

These anthropogenic impacts have modified the richness of assemblages as well as the biological dissimilarity among them. However, while changes in taxonomic dissimilarity (i.e. accounting for species composition) have been assessed intensively during the last decade there are still few assessments of changes in functional dissimilarity (i.e. accounting for the diversity of biological traits). Here, we assess the temporal changes in both taxonomic and functional dissimilarities for freshwater fish assemblages across E urope. Location Western P alaearctic, 137 river basins. Methods The J accard index was used to quantify the changes in both taxonomic and functional dissimilarity. We then partitioned dissimilarity to extract its turnover component and measured the changes in the contribution of turnover to dissimilarity. Results Functional homogenization exceeded taxonomic homogenization six‐fold. More importantly, we found only a moderate positive correlation between these changes. For instance, 40% of assemblages that experienced taxonomic differentiation were actually functionally homogenized. Taxonomic and functional homogenizations were stronger when the historical level of taxonomic dissimilarity among assemblages was high and when a high number of non‐native species were introduced in the assemblages. Moreover, translocated species (i.e. non‐native species originating from E urope) played a stronger role than exotic species (i.e. those coming from outside E urope) in this homogenization process, while extirpation did not play a significant role. Main conclusions Change in taxonomic diversity cannot be used to predict changes in functional diversity. In addition, as functional diversity has been proven to be a better indicator of ecosystem functioning and stability than taxonomic diversity, further studies are required to test the potential effects of functional homogenization at the local scale.",W1774269255,False,0.734610915184021

However, most diversity indices that rely on interspecies phylogenetic distances may increase with species loss and thus violate the principle of weak monotonicity. Moreover, most published phylogenetic diversity indices ignore the abundance distribution along phylogenetic trees, even though lineage abundances are crucial components of biodiversity. The recently introduced concept of phylogenetic entropy overcomes these limitations, but has not been decomposed across scales, i.e. into α, β and γ components. A full understanding of mechanisms sustaining biological diversity within and between communities needs such decomposition. Here, we propose an additive decomposition framework for estimating α, β and γ components of phylogenetic entropy. Based on simulated trees, we demonstrate its robustness to phylogenetic tree shape and species richness. Our decomposition fulfils the requirements of both independence between components and weak monotonicity.

Several contributions have challenged this approach or proposed alternative frameworks. Here, I review the concepts and methods used in these recent contributions, with the aim of clarifying: (1) the rationale behind the partitioning of beta diversity into species replacement and nestedness‐resultant dissimilarity, (2) how, based on this rationale, numerators and denominators of indices have to match, and (3) how nestedness and nestedness‐resultant dissimilarity are related but different concepts. Innovation The rationale behind measures of species replacement (turnover) dictates that the number of species that are replaced between sites (numerator of the index) has to be relativized with respect to the total number of species that could potentially be replaced (denominator). However, a recently proposed partition of Jaccard dissimilarity fails to do this. In consequence, this partition underestimates the contribution of species replacement and overestimates the contribution of richness differences to total dissimilarity. I show how Jaccard dissimilarity can be partitioned into meaningful turnover and nestedness components, and extend these new indices to multiple‐site situations. Finally the concepts of nestedness and nestedness‐resultant dissimilarity are discussed. Main conclusions Nestedness should be assessed using consistent measures that depend both on paired overlap and matrix filling, e.g. NODF, whereas beta‐diversity patterns should be examined using measures that allow the total dissimilarity to be separated into the components of dissimilarity due to species replacement and dissimilarity due to nestedness. In the case of multiple‐site dissimilarity patterns, averaged pairwise indices should never be used because the mean of the pairwise values is unable to accurately reflect the multiple‐site attributes of dissimilarity.",W1481780239,False,0.7712081670761108

On one side, elaborate display traits and preferences for them can be costly, reducing the nonsexual fitness of individuals possessing them, as well as their offspring. In contrast, sexual selection may reinforce nonsexual fitness if an individual's attractiveness and quality are genetically correlated. According to recent models, such good-genes mate choice should increase both the extent and rate of adaptation. We evolved 12 replicate populations of Drosophila serrata in a powerful two-way factorial experimental design to test the separate and combined contributions of natural and sexual selection to adaptation to a novel larval food resource. Populations evolving in the presence of natural selection had significantly higher mean nonsexual fitness when measured over three generations (13-15) during the course of experimental evolution (16-23% increase). The effect of natural selection was even more substantial when measured in a standardized, monogamous mating environment at the end of the experiment (generation 16; 52% increase). In contrast, and despite strong sexual selection on display traits, there was no evidence from any of the four replicate fitness measures that sexual selection promoted adaptation. In addition, a comparison of fitness measures conducted under different mating environments demonstrated a significant direct cost of sexual selection to females, likely arising from some form of male-induced harm. Indirect benefits of sexual selection in promoting adaptation to this novel resource environment therefore appear to be absent in this species, despite prior evidence suggesting the operation of good-genes mate choice in their ancestral environment. How novel environments affect the operation of good-genes mate choice is a fundamental question for future sexual selection research.",W1969085881,False,0.5435377955436707

Hamilton, and Richard Dawkins, evolutionary biologists have recognized that natural selection generally does not operate for the good of the group, but rather for the good of lower-level units such as the individual, the cell, even the gene. One of the fundamental problems of biology is: what keeps competition between these various levels of natural selection from destroying the common interests to be gained from cooperation? In this volume twelve prominent scientists explore this question, presenting a comprehensive survey of the current theoretical and empirical research in evolutionary biology.Recent studies show that at many levels of biological organization, mechanisms have evolved to prevent potential conflict in natural selection.

Optimal progenies would exactly match the population's evolutionary equilibrium sex ratio. There would be little variance among progenies.

Attributes such as diet, foraging strata, foraging time, and body size, in particular, characterize a large portion of the “Eltonian” niches of species. Here we present a global species‐level compilation of these key attributes for all 9993 and 5400 extant bird and mammal species derived from key literature sources. Global handbooks and monographs allowed the consistent sourcing of attributes for most species. For diet and foraging stratum we followed a defined protocol to translate the verbal descriptions into standardized, semiquantitative information about relative importance of different categories. Together with body size (continuous) and activity time (categorical) this enables a much finer distinction of species' foraging ecology than typical categorical guild assignments allow. Attributes lacking information for specific species are flagged, and interpolated values based on taxonomy are provided instead. The presented data set is limited by, among others, these select cases missing observed data, by errors and uncertainty in the expert assessment as presented in the literature, and by the lack of intraspecific information.

Parents often produce more offspring than they can rear in case special opportunities or calamities occur. This frequently leads to deprivations and even death of some offspring. This book is about the evolutionary diversity, importance, and consequences of such squeezes.

Why do only females care for eggs and young in some animals, only males in others, and both parents in a few? To what extent is parental care adjusted to variation in its benefits to offspring and its costs to parents? How do parents divide their resources between their sons and daughters? In this book separate chapters examine the evolution of variation in egg and neonate size, of viviparity and other forms of bearing, and of differences in the duration of incubation, gestation, and lactation. The book reviews theoretical and empirical predictions concerning the evolution of parental care and examines the extent to which these are supported by empirical evidence. The author examines the distribution of parental care among offspring, reviews the empirical evidence that parents invest to different extents in their sons and daughters, and discusses the degree to which parents manipulate the sex ratio of their progeny in relation to the availability of resources.",W1678060042,False,0.042634811252355576

https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.93.25.14637,The evolution of begging: Signaling and sibling competition,"In many species, young solicit food from their parents, which respond by feeding them. Because of the difference in genetic make-up between parents and their offspring and the consequent conflict, this interaction is often studied as a paradigm for the evolution of communication. Existent theoretical models demonstrate that chick signaling and parent responding can be stable if solicitation is a costly signal. The marginal cost of producing stronger signals allows the system to converge to an equilibrium: young beg with intensity that reflects their need, and parents use this information to maximize their own inclusive fitness. However, we show that there is another equilibrium where chicks do not beg and parents’ provisioning effort is optimal with respect to the statistically probable distribution of chicks’ states. Expected fitness for parents and offspring at the nonsignaling equilibrium is higher than at the signaling equilibrium. Because nonsignaling is stable and it is likely to be the ancestral condition, we would like to know how natural systems evolved from nonsignaling to signaling. We suggest that begging may have evolved through direct sibling fighting before the establishment of a parental response, that is, that nonsignaling squabbling leads to signaling. In multiple-offspring broods, young following a condition-dependent strategy in the contest for resources provide information about their condition. Parents can use this information even though it is not an adaptation for communication, and evolution will lead the system to the signaling equilibrium. This interpretation implies that signaling evolved in multiple-offspring broods, but given that signaling is evolutionarily stable, it would also be favored in species which secondarily evolved single-chick broods.",W1972469024,False,0.8980358839035034

In this study, we developed and applied a spatial explicit approach that allowed the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to study bacterial phylloplane communities of environmentally grown Arabidopsis thaliana. We found on average 5.4 × 10(6) bacteria cm(-2) leaf surface and 1.5 × 10(8) bacteria g(-1) fresh weight. Furthermore, we found that the total biomass in the phylloplane was normally distributed. About 31% of the bacteria found in the phylloplane did not hybridize to FISH probes but exhibited infrared autofluorescence indicative for aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs. Four sets of FISH probes targeting Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were sufficient to identify all other major contributors of the phylloplane community based on general bacterial probing. Spatial aggregation patterns were observed for all probe-targeted populations at distances up to 7 μm, with stronger tendencies to co-aggregate for members of the same phylogenetic group.

The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) and exopolysaccharide (EPS) of the wild type and the mutant strain do not differ in their sugar composition. CPS and EPS are composed of mannose, 4-O-methylgalactose/galactose, glucose, and galacturonic acid in a ratio of 1:1:2:1, respectively. H nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the EPS and CPS of the wild type and mutant strain are very similar, but not identical, suggesting minor structural variation in these polysaccharides. The lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of the above two strains were purified, and their compositions were determined. Gross differences in the chemical compositions of the two LPS were observed. Chemical and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses indicated that strain HS123 is a rough-type mutant lacking a complete LPS. The LPS of mutant strain HS123 is composed of mannose, glucose, glucosamine, 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid, and lipid A.

The exoC (pscA) gene is required for this synthesis by both bacteria as well as for the synthesis of capsular polysaccharide and normal lipopolysaccharide. We tested the possibility that the pleiotropic ExoC phenotype is due to a defect in the synthesis of an intermediate common to several polysaccharide biosynthetic pathways. Cytoplasmic extracts from wild-type A. tumefaciens and from exoC mutants of A. tumefaciens containing a cloned wild-type exoC gene synthesized in vitro UDP-glucose from glucose, glucose 1-phosphate, and glucose 6-phosphate. Extracts from exoC mutants synthesized UDP-glucose from glucose 1-phosphate but not from glucose or glucose 6-phosphate. Membranes from exoC mutant cells synthesized beta(1-2)glucan in vitro when exogenous UDP-glucose was added and contained the 235-kilodalton protein, which has been shown to carry out this synthesis in wild-type cells. We conclude that the inability of exoC mutants to synthesize beta(1-2)glucan is due to a deficiency in the activity of the enzyme phosphoglucomutase (EC 2.7.5.1), which in wild-type bacteria converts glucose 6-phosphate to glucose 1-phosphate, an intermediate in the synthesis of UDP-glucose.

All lipopolysaccharide samples separated into three major populations. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the fractions from S. typhimurium and S. minnesota indicated that the three peaks were made up of molecules with average O-antigen lengths of (i) 70 or more repeat units, (ii) 30 and 20 repeats units in the samples from S. typhimurium and S. minnesota, respectively, and (iii) 1 repeat unit. In contrast to the Salmonella samples, peak 1 from the E. coli samples was not detected on polyacrylamide gels and lacked detectable phosphate. This high-molecular-weight material had a sugar composition similar to that of O-antigen and was tentatively identified as capsular polysaccharide. Peaks 2 and 3 of the E. coli samples were analogous to those of the Salmonella isolates, containing lipopolysaccharide molecules with averages of 18 and 1 O-antigen repeat units, respectively. These lipopolysaccharide molecules did not completely dissociate during electrophoresis, and multimers were detected as distinct, anomalous, slow-migrating bands.

In specificity tests that included Ap665 and a similarly labelled universal probe and the respective complementary probes as controls, the hybridization signal was strong for Ap665 reactions with 12 A. pullulans strains but at or below background level for 98 other fungi including 82 phylloplane isolates. Scanning confocal laser microscopy was used to confirm that the fluorescence originated from the cytoplasmic matrix and to overcome limitations imposed on conventional microscopy by leaf topography. Images were recorded with a cooled charge-coupled device video camera and digitized for storage and manipulation. Image analysis was used to verify semiquantitative fluorescence ratings and to demonstrate how the distribution of the fluorescence signal in specific interactions (e.g., Ap665 with A. pullulans cells) could be separated at a given probability level from nonspecific fluorescence (e.g., in interactions of Ap665 with Cryptococcus laurentii cells) of an overlapping population. Image analysis methods were used also to quantify epiphytic A. pullulans populations based on cell number or percent coverage of the leaf surface. Under some conditions, leaf autofluorescence and the release of fluorescent compounds by leaves during the processing for hybridization decreased the signal-to-noise ratio.

The complement proteins can be activated through three cascade pathways: by the classical pathway, by the alternative pathway and by the antibody-independent lectin pathway (Fig. 1). The activation of the classical pathway is initiated by immune complexes containing IgM and IgG antibodies, Cl binds to the Fc region of antibodies through subcomponent Cl q, then the complex activates the further complement system by the cascade mechanism. The alternative pathway is directly activated from C3 by microorganisms, protozoa, or some activators such as lipopolysaccharide through an antibody independent mechanism. Recently, an antibody-independent mannanbinding lectin (MBL) pathway has also been established as the third activation pathway of complement systems [2,3]. This pathway is initiated by the binding of serum MBL (carbohydrate binding component in complement-dependent antibacterial factor, RaRF [4]), which is structurally related to Cl q, to the surface carbohydrates and activated through two MBL-associated serine proteases.

A comparative analysis.,"Further characterization of a proline-rich cell wall protein gene family from soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) has been accomplished by the isolation and sequence analysis of two additional genes, SbPRP2 and SbPRP3, which encode mRNAs of 1050 and 650 nucleotides in length, respectively. Like the proline-rich protein gene, SbPRP1, which was previously reported (Hong, J. C., Nagao, R. T., and Key, J. L. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 8367-8376), these two SbPRP genes encode proteins having a signal peptide sequence and repeats of Pro-Pro-Val-Tyr-Lys. The SbPRP2 gene encodes a protein of 26 kDa which contains a perfect alternating repeat of Pro-Pro-Val-Tyr-Lys and Pro-Pro-Val-Glu-Lys. The SbPRP3 encodes a 10-kDa protein which also contains Pro-Pro-Val-Tyr-Lys as a major amino acid repeat, but the overall amino acid sequence of this protein is more variable than that of SbPRP1 and SbPRP2. RNA blot analyses have demonstrated that there are marked differences in the pattern of expression of each SbPRP in various soybean tissues. In contrast, sequence analysis reveals that the SbPRP genes contain a high degree of sequence conservation. Nucleotide sequence homology extends 90 to 100 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site and includes typical CAT and TATA sequences. Approximately 80 base pairs of the 3'-noncoding sequence around the polyadenylation signal is also highly conserved. Therefore, the DNA sequence upstream of the 5'-conserved region is presumed to contain cis-elements accounting for the developmental and tissue specificity of gene expression. While the pentameric repeat structures occur in all SbPRP genes, the encoded proteins are predicted to be different in several features including basicity, substitutions of tyrosine and glutamic acid in the repeat, and the size of the mature protein.",W1483610007,False,0.002440178068354726

This editorial emphasizes the need to develop a network integrating different research approaches (‘yellow brick roads’) to address the great challenge (‘finding the end of the rainbow’) of quantifying, understanding and predicting LDD and its implications. I review the key avenues for future research suggested in the special issue contributions, and stress the critical importance of properly considering the spatial and temporal scales relevant to the process and system of interests. I propose combining absolute and proportional definitions of LDD as a default practice in any investigation of LDD processes. When LDD is defined primarily by an absolute critical distance that characterizes key feature(s) of the system of interest, a quantitative assessment of the proportion of dispersal events expected to move beyond this critical threshold distance should also be provided. When LDD is defined primarily by a certain small fraction of dispersal events that travel longer than all others, an estimate of the absolute distance associated with this high percentile at the tail of the dispersal curve should also be added.",W1549062888,False,0.5188851356506348

This approach depends on there being enough isotopic difference in tissues among potential source populations such that individuals can be unequivocally assigned to their source. The isotopic mapping of such populations will be feasible only for species occurring in relatively few disjunct populations. However, the identification of isotopic outliers within known populations will be an extremely useful first step in the forensic application of stable isotopes to identify dispersal in general, and LDD in particular. The use of deuterium isotope analysis (δD) of tissues that can be assigned to its source (e.g. feather moult or its hair growth location) has provided a recent breakthrough in our ability to associate individuals with geographical origins at continental scales. The combination of this stable isotope with others and the ultimate combination of a variety of techniques, including the measurement of trace elements and molecular genetics markers, will undoubtedly improve resolution. The isotopic cataloguing of known history (i.e. philopatric) individuals within populations will be an important step in applying isotope techniques to evaluating LDD in any species. For aquatic insects, the isotopic marking of large numbers of individuals is possible through isotopic enrichment of local food webs using labelled compounds.",W1574178176,False,0.8071628212928772

https://doi.org/10.1086/283342,A Model for the Evolution of Dioecy and Gynodioecy,"A model for the evolution of gynodioecy from the hermaphrodite or monoecious condition is described, taking into account the effects of partial selfing and inbreeding depression. It is shown that a mutant causing male-sterility can be selected even if the female plants have the same ovule output as the hermaphrodites, but that the conditions for this are very stringent: The product of the selfing rate and the inbreeding depression must exceed one-half. If the females have an increased ovule output, gynodioecy can evolve with lower values of the selfing and inbreeding depression parameters. Expressions for the equilibrium frequency of females and of the male-sterility gene in both the dominant and the recessive case are given. By a similar technique, conditions for the evolution of androdioecy are derived. In a selfing population, these conditions are much less easily satisfied than those for gynodioecy, though in a randomly mating population the conditions are similar: If ovule production is abolished, pollen production must be more than doubled, or vice versa. Since androdioecy is known to be a very rare condition, it seems likely that avoidance of selfing has played a role in the evolution of gynodioecy. Using the equilibria derived for gynodioecy, the conditions for the evolution of subdioecy or dioecy, by means of a partial or total female-sterility mutation, are studied. In contrast to the situation in a hermaphrodite population, a female-sterility gene can be selected in a gynodioecious population if it confers a moderate increase in pollen output; some increase in pollen output is essential. The fate of such a female-sterility gene also depends on its linkage with the male-sterility gene. If this is recessive, and the female-sterility gene is dominant and has an effect in the females as well as the hermaphrodite individuals, then the second mutation will usually be eliminated unless it occurs at a locus tightly linked to the first gene. In other cases there is no such ""linkage constraint,"" though in all situations there may be selection for tighter linkage between the loci; this will result in an initially subdioecious population becoming more fully dioecious. These results agree with some of the facts known about the evolution of dioecy in plants. First, since gynodioecy is more often controlled by a recessive than a dominant gene, male heterogamety should be commoner than female, as is observed. Second, subdioecy should be common, since full dioecy requires not only the correct phenotypic effects of the two genes but also complementary dominance relations and tight linkage; subdioecy is indeed known in many species. The equilibria reached by our model have only one type of female in appreciable frequency, whereas the polleniferous individuals may fall into several genotypic classes; it is often observed that in subdioecious species the males are more variable than the females, regardless of which is the heterogametic sex. Finally, the equilibria generated by our model agree closely with the results of genetical studies of those dioecious species with male-determining Y chromosomes that have been investigated, in which both male-and female-sterility factors have been found, showing complementary dominance relations and no crossing-over between the loci, so that just two gamete types exist. Such a situation can be explained by the operation of the linkage constraint, which ensures that only linked mutations become established and does not require that unlinked genes have been brought together. This is consistent with the fact that dioecious species often have the same chromosome numbers as their bisexual relatives.",W1968182887,False,0.5084031820297241

The low yields were apparently due to low abundance in source tissues, aggravated by enzyme instability. Here we describe an immunological method for purification of workable quantities from florets of Brassica oleracea ssp. botrytis (cauliflower). Florets that had undergone browning due to exposure to sunlight contained higher S-GT activities than are normally found in Brassica tissues. S-GT was adsorbed from crude tissue extracts onto an agarose-monoclonal antibody complex. Elution from the complex required harsh alkaline conditions (pH 11.5), giving extremely variable activity recoveries (maximum 20%). The eluate contained two proteins that could be separated readily by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or anion-exchange chromatography. The overall S-GT protein recovery was estimated at less than 200 [mu]g/kg of cauliflower tissue. Molecular weight determinations with homogeneous cauliflower S-GT gave relative molecular weight (Mr) values of 55,500 as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 57,600 by gel chromatography; isoenzymes with isoelectric point values of 4.80 and 4.95 were identified. A polyclonal antibody raised against denatured enzyme showed broad cross-reactivity in immunoblots with S-GT from a number of Brassica species and other crucifers. The monoclonal antibody that was used in the immunopurification was much more specific; it exclusively precipitated S-GT isoenzymes that had their genomic origin in the primary diploids B. oleracea and Brassica campestris. Thus, all of the S-GT was precipitated from the amphidiploid Brassica napus, which is a hybrid of B. orleracea and B. campestris. About half of the S-GT was precipitated from the amphidiploids Brassica carinata and Brassica juncea, which have B. oleracea and B. campestris as one of their parents, respectively. It was shown that the S-GT isoenzymes of B. juncea with Mr 55,500 and about 57,000 originate from the parents B. campestris and B. nigra, respectively.",W1533827901,False,0.004546963144093752

The present study investigated the changes in glucosinolate concentration in leaves of oilseed rape following inoculation with the dark leaf spot pathogen (Alternaria brassicae). Fourth and sixth leaves of the single‐low cultivar Bienvenu (low in erucic acid) and the double‐low cultivar Cobra (low in erucic acid and glucosinolate) were removed at intervals up to twenty days after inoculation and analysed for glucosinolate content using HPLC. Glucosinolates accumulated in inoculated leaves of both cultivars but the accumulation was greater for cv. Bienvenu, especially in sixth leaves. Among the glucosinolates, aliphatic compounds accumulated rapidly in cv. Bienvenu, but later declined. Indolyl and aromatic glucosinolates accumulated in both cultivars, but at a slower rate than the aliphatic glucosinolates. There were differences in the extent to which individual glucosinolates accumulated after inoculation. Disease symptoms were initially more extensive on cv. Cobra than on cv. Bienvenu but were similar on corresponding leaves of the two cultivars by the end of the experiment. However, sixth leaves had significantly less lesioning than fourth leaves.

Percentage K in dry matter depended on the amounts of N, P, K or water received by the crops and was linearly related to fresh weight to dry weight ratio, but the slope of this relationship depended on whether or not the crops received K. Expressing K concentrations on the basis of tissue water eliminated differences between crops, except for those given insufficient K. Barley crops given fertilizer K maintained K concentrations in their tissue water of about 200 mmol/kg tissue water for most of the growth period but crops grown without K had only 50–70 mmol/kg tissue water. The results indicate that K concentrations in the tissue water are a more reliable indicator of tissue K status than % K in dry matter. Decreases in crop K content resulting from poor K supply were balanced by increases in Na and Ca (but not Mg) contents so that total cation concentrations in the tissue water were similar in low and high K crops. The extra Na and Ca are probably primarily involved in maintaining charge balance for anion absorption but once in the plant they may also substitute for K in its osmotic role.",W2020361514,False,0.8151056170463562

On the basis of fluorimetric, light-scattering, viscosimetric measurements and of the renaturation ability of denatured bacterial DNA, certain results have been obtained. In addition to monofunctional photoadditions, psoralen can give bifunctional binding by irradiation at 365 nm both with denatured DNA and with r-RNA. However, when irradiation of denatured DNA in the presence of psoralen was performed in a concentrated solution (0.4%), the formation of bifunctional additions between two different strands was demonstrated by the increase (50%) of molecular weight of denatured DNA. However, when irradiation of denatured DNA was performed in more dilute solutions (0.1%), the bifunctional photoaddition of psoralen took place producing only bi­ functional additions in the same strand, very probably with the formation of loops, as has been shown by the absence of increase of molecular weight of DNA and by the more restricted structure assumed by the macromolecule, revealed by the light-scattering and viscosimetric measurements. The formation of these bifunctional additions was confirmed by the reduced rate of renaturation shown by denatured bacterial DNA after irradiation in the presence of psoralen.

We repeatedly measured the extrafloral nectar produced by bracts of flowers throughout their phenology from the bud stage until and beyond flower opening. We studied the behaviour of ants towards the reproductive apparatus of the flowers and conducted ant exclusion experiments to test for my negative effect on herbivores of fruit production. Conclusions: Pollinators did not visit inflorescences that had more than four ants on them. Ants. solely by their presence on bud bracts and bracteoles. intimidate other insects, both pollinators and herbivores. Some spatial and temporal mechanisms partially prevent negative ant-pollinator interactions. First. extrafloral nectar production on the bracts of flower buds, which attracts ants to inflorescences. was highest at night, attracting the largest numbers of ants at that time, whereas the major pollinators were active during the day. Second, this extrafloral nectar production declines after the first flower of each inflorescence opens. Third, the anthers and stigma are placed at the apex of a thin elongate axis, which offers a precarious foothold to ants. One ant species, Crematogaster dohrni, succeeds despite these difficulties by acting just before the flower-opens, and damaging the flower when the style and stamens are still folded.

In contrast, the conjugation of jasmonic acid (JA) to isoleucine (Ile) is known to enhance the activity of JA. Whereas hydroxylation and carboxylation of JA-Ile permanently inactivates JA-Ilemediated signaling in plants, the alternative deactivation pathway of JA-Ile by its direct hydrolysis to JA remains unstudied. We show that Nicotiana attenuata jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine hydrolase 1 (JIH1), a close homologue of previously characterized indoleacetic acid alanine resistant 3 (IAR3) gene in Arabidopsis, hydrolyzes both JA-Ile and IAA-Ala in vitro. When the herbivory-inducible NaJIH1 gene was silenced by RNA interference, JA-Ile levels increased dramatically after simulated herbivory in irJIH1, compared with wild-type (WT) plants. When specialist (Manduca sexta) or generalist (Spodoptera littoralis) herbivores fed on irJIH1 plants they gained significantly less mass compared with those feeding on wild-type (WT) plants. The poor larval performance was strongly correlated with the higher accumulation of several JA-Ile-dependent direct defense metabolites in irJIH1 plants. In the field, irJIH1 plants attracted substantially more Geocoris predators to the experimentally attached M. sexta eggs on their leaves, compared with empty vector plants, which correlated with higher herbivory-elicited emissions of volatiles known to function as indirect defenses. We conclude that NaJIH1 encodes a new homeostatic step in JA metabolism that, together with JA and JA-Ilehydroxylation and carboxylation of JA-Ile, rapidly attenuates the JA-Ile burst, allowing plants to tailor the expression of direct and indirect defenses against herbivore attack in nature.",W1593621669,False,0.7377060651779175

Degradation of JAZ proteins in Arabidopsis leads to the release of a bHLH transcription factor, MYC2, which functions as a master regulator of JA-dependent defense responses.

In some cases, this adenylation has been shown to catalyze hormone conjugation to amino acids. Here we report molecular characterization of the GH3-LIKE DEFENSE GENE 1 (GDG1), a member of the GH3-like gene family, and show that GDG1 is an important component of SA-mediated defense against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Expression of GDG1 is induced earlier and to a higher level in response to avirulent pathogens compared to virulent pathogens. gdg1 null mutants are compromised in several pathogen defense responses, including activation of defense genes and resistance against virulent and avirulent bacterial pathogens. Accumulation of free and glucoside-conjugated SA (SAG) in response to pathogen infection is compromised in gdg1 mutants. All defense-related phenotypes of gdg1 can be rescued by external application of SA, suggesting that gdg1 mutants are defective in the SA-mediated defense pathway(s) and that GDG1 functions upstream of SA. Our results suggest that GDG1 contributes to both basal and resistance gene-mediated inducible defenses against P. syringae (and possibly other pathogens) by playing a critical role in regulating the levels of pathogen-inducible SA.

To probe the transcriptional regulation of the nicotine pathway, we constructed two subtracted cDNA libraries from methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-treated Nicotiana benthamiana roots directly in a viral vector suitable for virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). Sequencing of cDNA inserts produced a data set of 3271 expressed sequence tags (ESTs; 1898 unigenes), which were enriched in jasmonate-responsive genes, and included 69 putative transcription factors (TFs). After a VIGS screen to determine their effect on nicotine metabolism, six TFs from three different TF families altered constitutive and MeJA-induced leaf nicotine levels. VIGS of a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TF, NbbHLH3, and an auxin response factor TF, NbARF1, increased nicotine content compared with control plants; silencing the bHLH family members, NbbHLH1 and NbbHLH2, an ethylene response factor TF, NbERF1, and a homeobox domain-like TF, NbHB1, reduced nicotine levels. Transgenic N. benthamiana plants overexpressing NbbHLH1 or NbbHLH2 showed increased leaf nicotine levels compared with vector controls. RNAi silencing led to both reduced nicotine and decreased levels of transcript encoding of enzymes of the nicotine pathway. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that recombinant NbbHLH1 and NbbHLH2 directly bind G-box elements identified from the putrescine N-methyltransferase promoter.

https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.36.4.492,Hexitols in coconut milk: Their role in nurture of dividing cells,"Coconut milk, the liquid endosperm of the coconut (Cocos nucifera L.), has special interest because it will induce otherwise mature, non-growing cells to divide and to grow rapidly (3, 4). Similar properties reside in analogous morphological situations, such as the immature caryopsis of Zea mays and the liquid present in immature fruits of Juglans (18) or of Aesf alus (12, 24, & also see 25). A nutritive relationship also exists between the female gametophyte, sometimes called endosperm, and the archegonia and embryos of the gymnosperm Ginkgo; extracts of this gametophyte will also induce cells of mature tissue of carrot root to resume active growth (18). Therefore, the fluids that nourish immature embryos seem especially able to induce growth in the mature cells even of some other plants than the ones in which they were laid down. This raises the question whether the behavior of the zygote is due to its special nature or to its nurture by the special fluid contents of the embryo sac, by the substances which are contained in the endosperm, and by other special nutritive organs. Free cells obtained from mature carrot phloem may be cultured in media which contain coconut milk (21) and may grow and regenerate a complete and mature plant (20). In this7 respect the free cells imitate the zygote, and the coconut milk its normal nutritional supply. Moreover, as the cells grow and develop, they form structures which are strongly reminiscent of pro-embryonic development (15). Therefore, a full knowledge of the chemical constituents of coconut milk which cause these growth responses would have an important bearing upon many problems of cell growth and cell division. This knowledge would also have important implications for protein synthesis, which is stimulated in quantity and modified in kind during the induction of growth in carrot and potato cells (27). Following the observations of Blakeslee and van Overbeek (28, 29), work upon the chemical constituents of coconut milk was pursued sporadically in different laboratories (for references see 25). In this laboratory, investigation has been in progress for some years. Clearly, the growth induction which is pr,oduced by the coconut milk, over and above the effects due to common nutrients and vitamins, is not a simple effect due to a single substance. On the contrary, it has been emphasized that no substance singly and independently controls cell division (see 25 & references there cited). In part the effect of coconut milk is non-specific and is replaceable by casein hydrolysate, or by other sources of the reduced nitrogen compounds, from which the cells may synthesize protein more readily than they do from nitrate (13). Even whole coconut milk alone will not trigger the growth of some cells (e.g. potato tuber), for it needs to be supplemented by one of a large array of compounds which are now known to act synergistically with the coconut milk. The substance 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and many of its analogues with different ring configurations or different side chains, can also function in this manner (14,16, see also 25). Several of the halogen-substituted phenylacetic acids (26) and certain a-substituted propionic acids (14) can also work along with the coconut milk. This paper now designates certain hexitols to be responsible for part of the effect for which coconut milk (or its morphological equivalent) has hitherto been regarded as a specific source. Early work on the chemical fractionation of coconut milk and similar fluids recently has been reviewed (25). This work encountered the difficulty that, when purified, the isolated substances only expressed their activity in the presence of other sub-fractions from the coconut milk. While this statement still holds true, the work to be described permits the critical identification of at least three of the synergists which contribute to the total growth which is stimulated by whole coconut milk.",W2019131091,False,0.6082009673118591

Two types of synthase with similar functions are discussed as an interesting example. Stilbene synthases, e.g. resveratrol synthase, produce the stilbene backbone as a key reaction in the biosynthesis of stilbene-type phytoalexins. Chalcone synthase is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of flavonoids, including certain phytoalexins derived from a 6′-deoxychalcone which is synthesized by cooperation of chalcone synthase with a reductase. Resveratrol and chalcone synthases utilize the same substrates (4-coumaroyl-CoA and 3 molecules of malonyl-CoA ) and catalyze the same condensing type of enzyme reaction (resulting in sequential addition of acetate units via malonyl-CoA ), but the products differ in the newly formed ring systems (resveratrol and naringenin chalcone). A comparative analysis of cloned DNA sequences and of the reaction mechanisms indicates that the two enzymes are closely related. It seems likely that the proteins possess a common scaffold for substrate recognition and for the condensing reaction, and that the different folding of an enzyme-bound intermediate prior to closure of the new aromatic ring is responsible for the formation of the different products. The same type of condensing reaction is utilized by the 2-ketoacyl-ACP synthases of fatty-acid biosynthesis. How ever, the available data indicate that these enzymes share little overall homology with either resveratrol or chalcone synthase. One exception maybe a short aminoacid sequence which corresponds to the active center of the condensing reaction in 2-ketoacyl-ACP synthases.",W104425390,False,0.00042518918053247035

Under ambient CO2 and O2 conditions, photosynthesis and export rates were similar at 15 and 25[deg]C, but both declined as leaf temperature was raised from 25 to 40[deg]C. Suppressing photorespiration between 15 and 40[deg]C by manipulating CO2 and O2 levels resulted in higher rates of leaf photosynthesis, total sugar synthesis, and export. There was a linear relationship between the rate of photosynthesis and the rate of export between 15 and 35[deg]C. At these temperatures, 60 to 80% of the carbon fixed was readily exported with sucrose, raffinose, and stachyose, which together constituted over 90% of phloem mobile assimilates. Above 35[deg]C, however, export during photosynthesis was inhibited both in photorespiratory conditions, which inhibited photosynthesis, and in nonphotorespiratory conditions, which did not inhibit photosynthesis. Sucrose and raffinose but not stachyose accumulated in the leaf at 40[deg]C. When leaves were preincubated at 40[deg]C and then cooled to 35[deg]C, export recovered more slowly than photosynthesis. These data are consistent with the view that impairment of export processes, rather than photosynthetic processes associated with light trapping, carbon reduction, and sucrose synthesis, accounted for the marked reduction in export between 35 and 40[deg]C. Taken together, the data indicated that temperature changes between 15 and 40[deg]C had two effects on photosynthesis and concurrent export.

Like many large carnivores, mortality due to conflict with humans, particularly control associated with livestock depredation, is a major cause of decline. Reversal of the decline will require mitigating the conflict, which in turn necessitates assessment of the problem and a more complete understanding of wild dog depredation behavior. I discuss depredation studies in North America and Europe that may inform wild dog conflict and behavior, although research on wild dogs and other predators in African contexts is urgently needed. Intricately linked to the negative values that many Africans hold for the species, wild dogs prey on domestic stock, including sheep, goats, cattle, and farmed game animals, wherever researchers have looked in human communities. The magnitude of actual wild dog predation is little studied, however. I propose to investigate wild dogs in livestock areas of central Botswana where a poorly known population exists across several land-use patterns and in conflict with human communities. By understanding the conditions in which wild dogs prey on domestic stock, conservation biologists, together with wildlife managers and livestock producers, can work toward preventing depredation loss or increasing local tolerance. Human-carnivore coexistence will be a major challenge in most African contexts where economic losses, even when small, can be significant to small-scale producers and lethal control can be convenient and effective.",W152227157,False,0.8120763897895813

To date, no published results, however, exist that would offer explanation for the origin of this behavioral variation within populations. Using microsatellites as markers, we estimated the genetic variability of juvenile brown trout ( Salmo trutta ) individuals whose behavior had been individually recorded in a trade‐off situation where both predator chemical cues and food were present. Mean overall heterozygosity and the internal relatedness of fish associated significantly with their activity and foraging, so that the genetically more variable individuals showed more risk‐prone behavior under predation risk. No association between genetic variability and behavior was found in trials where predator odors were not present. These results were consistent over the three study populations of brown trout with different backgrounds, suggesting that the phenomenon is of general nature in this species. Of the possible mechanisms suggested to enable the existence of the positive association between neutral microsatellite variation and fitness‐related trait, the local effect hypothesis gained more support from our data than the general effect hypothesis.",W1823662224,False,0.8376522660255432

One rarely considered pathway for this action is via parasite-mediated selection against inbreeding. If parasites impose a fitness cost on their host and the offspring of close relatives have greater susceptibility to parasites due to the increased homozygosity that results from inbreeding, then parasite-mediated mortality may select against inbred individuals. This hypothesis has not yet been tested within a natural vertebrate population. Here we show that relatively inbred Soay sheep (Ovis aries), as assessed by microsatellite heterozygosity, are more susceptible to parasitism by gastrointestinal nematodes, with interactions indicating greatest susceptibility among adult sheep at high population density. During periods of high overwinter mortality on the island of Hirta, St. Kilda, Scotland, highly parasitised individuals were less likely to survive. More inbred individuals were also less likely to survive, which is due to their increased susceptibility to parasitism, because survival was random with respect to inbreeding among sheep that were experimentally cleared of their gastrointestinal parasite burden by anthelminthic treatment. As a consequence of this selection, average microsatellite heterozygosity increases with age in St. Kildan Soay sheep. We suggest that parasite-mediated selection acts to maintain genetic variation in this small island population by removing less heterozygous individuals.",W2032301833,False,0.8506960868835449

Methods to identify novel microsatellite loci commonly use subtractive hybridization to enrich small-insert genomic libraries for repeat sequences. A critical step in enrichment is attachment of an oligonucleotide linker to genomic DNA fragments so that repeat-containing sequences can be recovered by PCR for cloning. Current linkers and ligation methods rely on single restriction enzymes to size-fraction genomic DNA and generate complementary ends. These restriction enzyme/linker combinations are often species-specific, give poor recovery of repeat-enriched DNA and yield library inserts that are not a broad sample of the genome. We have developed a blunt-end linker, named SNX for its restriction sites, that allows the use of combinations of restriction enzymes to digest the majority of genomic DNA into the 200-1000-bp range. SNX is attached to genomic DNA with a simultaneous ligation/restriction reaction that is highly efficient and improves recovery of sequences after subtractive hybridization. SNX can be used for microsatellite enrichment in any species, since ligation is independent of the restriction enzymes used to size-fraction genomic DNA. These methods improve current repeat-enrichment strategies, resulting in representative small-insert libraries with a very high proportion of positive clones.",W1491979943,False,0.00494837760925293

The purified enzyme had a molecular mass of 50 kDa and an isoelectric point of 3.2. In addition to MnP, low levels of laccase and lignin peroxidase were detected. Synthetic 14 C-ring-labelled lignin ( 14 C-DHP) was efficiently degraded during SSF. Approximately 75% of the initial radioactivity was released as 14 CO 2, while only 6% was associated with the residual straw material, including the well-developed fungal biomass. On the basis of this finding we concluded that at least partial extracellular mineralization of lignin may have occurred. This conclusion was supported by the fact that we detected high levels of organic acids in the fermented straw (the maximum concentrations in the water phases of the straw cultures were 45 mM malate, 3.5 mM fumarate, and 10 mM oxalate), which rendered MnP effective and therefore made partial direct mineralization of lignin possible. Experiments performed in a cell-free system, which simulated the conditions in the straw cultures, revealed that MnP in fact converted part of the 14 C-DHP to 14 CO 2 (which accounted for up to 8% of the initial radioactivity added) and 14 C-labelled water-soluble products (which accounted for 43% of the initial radioactivity) in the presence of natural levels of organic acids (30 mM malate, 5 mM fumarate).",W1606614020,False,0.385386198759079

Mineralization of plant nutrients from soil organic matter is a major function of the soil microbial biomass. Crop rotations affecting microbial biomass would make it possible to manage residues and rotations for the benefit of each crop. For soils, microbial biomass measurements may provide the information needed for ecosystem-level monitoring for initial disturbance and recovery.

Most researchers assume that there is little phenotypic variation in cichlid fishes. I report here extensive phenotypic plasticity in a Neotropical cichlid species. I examined the influence of diet on trophic morphology during ontogeny in Cichlasoma managuense. Two groups of full siblings were fed two different diets for eight months after the onset of feeding; thereafter both groups were fed a common diet. Phenotypes that differed significantly at 8.5 months converged almost completely at 16.5 months. If feeding on two different diets is continued after 8.5 months, the phenotypes remain distinct. Differences in diet and possibly in feeding mode are believed to have caused these phenotypic changes. Phenotypic plasticity is described in terms of a qualitative model of heterochrony in which phenotypic change in morphology is explained as retardation of the normal developmental rate. If phenotypic expression of morphology is equally plastic in African cichlid species as it may be in the American cichlids, as exemplified by C. managuense, then taxonomic, ecological, and evolutionary analyses of ""species flocks"" may be in need of revision. However, Old World cichlids may be less phenotypically plastic than New World cichlids, and this may contribute to the observed differences in speciation rate and degree of endemism.",W1987122309,False,0.5956594944000244

The first hypothesis was rejected; offspring of the profundal morph grew slightly better than offspring of the littoral morph at 10° C in the laboratory. The second and third hypotheses were supported by the data. Wild‐caught fish of the two morphs differed in several morphometric characters and most of the differences persisted in the offspring.

Atavisms emerge as evidence of localized modifications in development of an organ or of one of its parts. Different developmental processes can be triggered within the same organ rudiment, presumably in response to the same stimulus. We saw that that stimulus can have a genetic basis in a mutational event, which can be selected for. We also saw that atavism can be produced by experimental manipulation within developing systems ‐increased growth of the chick fibula, enamel production from avian ectoderm, and balancer formation in amphibians. Such atavisms are not based on heritable genetic changes. They indicate the developmental plasticity that exists within embryos and the relative ease with which development can be switched from one programme to another. 2. Examination of mutants (wingless chicks), limbless vertebrates and experimental manipulation of embryos, shows that cell death, inductive tissue interactions and altered patterns of growth are developmental mechanisms used in the formation of atavisms. 3. Differential development mechanisms can be triggered within the same organ at the same time to produce atavisms. In the guinea pig, formation of atavistic digit V involves prolongation of growth of metatarsal V whereas formation of atavistic digit I involves development of a new metatarsal I. 4. Secondary functional modifications ensure that the atavism is integrated with the other components of the functional unit, as illustrated by extra digits in horses or guinea pigs and fibulae in birds. Atavistic 2nd and 4th digits in horses arise by continued growth of their primordia. A consequent reduction in the growth rate of digit 3, the normal single functional digit, enables all three digits to attain approximately equal lengths and so potentially to function. The altered functional load transmitted to the limbs results in secondary but correlated alterations in muscles and skeletal elements in other portions of the limbs. The fact that embryonic digit 2 normally develops to a more advanced state than digit 4 explains why digit 2 more often develops atavistically, for if variation in growth rate is the basis for the atavistic digit, digit 2 has an advantage over digit 4. 5. Atavisms should not be an embarrassment to the evolutionary biologist. They are the outward and visible sign of a hidden potential for morphology change possessed by all organisms. Neither basic capacity to form the organ nor patterning information is lost. Modification of components of inductive tissue interactions helps to explain how organs are lost during evolution (also see Regal, 1977); retention of the basic mechanism explains how structures can be revived as atavisms (also see Rachootin &amp; Thomson, 1981). Frequency of atavisms thus provides an indication of the degree of modification or loss of the underlying developmental programme.",W1963600470,False,0.17279531061649323

Of particular interest, the CM patients showed markedly reduced frequencies of CD4+ cells, the number of which also normalized slower than in the other clinical groups. In all patients, the T-cell frequencies gradually approached normal values after the initiation of therapy, whereas the absolute numbers rapidly reverted from lower than normal to higher than normal before returning to steady-state levels. Furthermore, the initially reduced T-cell surface density of the T-cell receptor/CD3 complex, which rapidly normalized, was a general finding for all three clinical groups, suggesting a state of peripheral T-cell hyporesponsiveness during acute malaria.

After such drug treatment the parasites disappear from the blood for 6–11 days, after which a recrudescence with a low peak occurs. Most animals overcome this second parasitaemia and the parasites finally disappear completely. After recovery, mice exhibit an immune response to a challenge infection and, after a short period of parasitaemia during which a low peak is reached, the animals recover completely. This immunity, once acquired, apparently persists for the lifetime of the host. The establishment of the immune state depends on the period of patent parasitaemia during the primary infection and the longer this period the greater is the chance of a solid immunity developing. Immunity may be exhibited by mice treated with chloroquine as early as the 3rd day of infection. Killed parasites have no immunizing effect. Mice splenectomized before infection are capable of an immune response, and mice splenectomized after radical cure are also able to overcome a challenge infection. In both these cases more than one injection of chloroquine is required. The immunity produced in mice is that of the true sterile type, equivalent to that produced against P. berghei in rats, and is species-specific, conferring no resistance to infection with P. berghei. P. vinckei infections in mice provide a useful immunological model for laboratory studies. The immune response is predictable and easy to induce, and this parasite is therefore superior to P. berghei for immunological studies.

Using limiting dilution conditions, no malaria-specific T cell responses could be measured in the peripheral blood for up to 21 days after infection with P. chabaudi, whereas T cells responding to malaria Ag were readily detected in the spleen. This was true for T cells providing help and for those producing IFN-gamma.

Furthermore, feeding-induced resistance provides the mechanistic basis for many cases of delayed interspecific competition, whereby previous feeding by one species diminishes the performance of other herbivores which attack the same plant later in the season. This phenomenon, however, has been very poorly investigated for sap-feeding insects. The results we present here for salt marsh-inhabiting planthoppers (Prokelisia dolus and P. marginata) provide one of the few known examples of delayed, plant-mediated interspecific competition between two sap-feeding insects. Three lines of experimental evidence from the laboratory, field cages, and open field plots provide support for the detrimental effects of previous feeding by one planthopper species on the subsequent survival and performance of the other. Laboratory experiments showed that prior feeding on cordgrass by one congener resulted in reduced performance of the other in the following generation. However, the effect was asymmetric. Prior feeding by P. dolus resulted in prolonged development and reduced body size (a correlate of fecundity) in P. marginata, whereas only development was protracted in P. dolus when plants were previously exposed to P. marginata. Consequently, P. dolus appears to be the superior competitor in the context of delayed, plant-mediated interactions. The negative effects of previous feeding by P. dolus on the development time, body size, and survival of P. marginata obtained in the laboratory were confirmed both in cages and on cage-free islets of cordgrass in the field. Feeding-induced reductions in host-plant quality by P. dolus may provide additional impetus for P. marginata to migrate from shared habitats on the high marsh to nutritionally superior plants in the low marsh rarely occupied by P. dolus. The mechanism underlying the delayed competitive effects between Prokelisia planthoppers is most likely diminished plant nutrition, because feeding by P. dolus significantly reduces the concentration of essential amino acids in cordgrass. The asymmetry of plant-mediated competition between the Prokelisia species may be due to the ability of P. dolus to better tolerate feeding-depleted levels of plant nitrogen via compensatory feeding. Even though these two planthoppers do not suffer significant fitness reductions during contemporaneous interactions, they compete severely in the context of feeding-induced plant resistance which is expressed later in the season. This result, coupled with the fact that most studies of interspecific interaction between herbivorous insects are contemporaneous, indicates that interspecific competition may be profoundly underestimated as a structuring force in phytophagous insect communities.",W1993551939,False,0.523992121219635

(Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) induces systemic changes to the glucosinolate profile, most noticeably an increase in the concentration of indole glucosinolates. When jasmonic acid was applied to the cotyledons of the plant, a similar effect was observed. Feeding tests with artificial substrates compared a glucosinolate fraction from jasmonic acid‐treated plants with a similar fraction from untreated plants. In these tests, alterations to the glucosinolate profile increased the feeding of a crucifer‐specialist feeder ( P. chrysocephala ). However, in whole plant tests, P. chrysocephala did not feed more on the jasmonic acid treated plants than on the controls. This implies that other aspects of the damage response are being induced by the jasmonic acid treatment and having a negative effect on subsequent herbivory.",W1979265829,False,0.5574710965156555

A dendrite from one of these neurones terminates in a tubular body at the shaft base, whereas dendrites from the others run unbranched to a pore at the shaft tip. Such a structure typifies a sensillum with a combined gustatory/mechanosensory function. Electrophysiological recordings using the tip‐recording technique confirmed that this sensillum contains one mechanosensory cell and several chemosensory cells. The chemosensory cells were responsive to host plant chemicals. Sensilla chaetica were also found to be responsive to glucosinolates. One of the sensilla chaetica emerges from a domed area of cuticle on antennomere six.

A critical property of count data is its mean–variance relationship, yet this is rarely considered in multivariate analysis in ecology. 2. This study considers what is being implicitly assumed about the mean–variance relationship in distance‐based analyses – multivariate analyses based on a matrix of pairwise distances – and what the effect is of any misspecification of the mean–variance relationship. 3. It is shown that distance‐based analyses make implicit assumptions that are typically out‐of‐step with what is observed in real data, which has major consequences. 4. Potential consequences of this mean–variance misspecification are: confounding location and dispersion effects in ordinations; misleading results when trying to identify taxa in which an effect is expressed; failure to detect a multivariate effect unless it is expressed in high‐variance taxa. 5. Data transformation does not solve the problem. 6.

,Diagnostic Checking in Regression Relationships,"is still one of the most popular tools for data analysis despite (or due to) its simple structure. Although it is appropriate in many situations, there are many pitfalls that might affect the quality of conclusions drawn from fitted models or might even lead to uninterpretable results. Some of these pitfalls that are considered especially important in applied econometrics are heteroskedasticity or serial correlation of the error terms, structural changes in the regression coefficients, nonlinearities, functional misspecification or omitted variables. Therefore, a rich variety of diagnostic tests for these situations have been developed in the econometrics community, a collection of which has been implemented in the packages lmtest and strucchange covering the problems mentioned above. These diagnostic tests are not only useful in econometrics but also in many other fields where linear regression is used, which we will demonstrate with an application from biostatistics. As Breiman (2001) argues it is important to assess the goodness-of-fit of data models, in particular not only using omnibus tests but tests designed for a certain direction of the alternative. These diagnostic checks do not have to be seen as pure significance procedures but also as an explorative tool to extract information about the structure of the data, especially in connection with residual plots or other diagnostic plots. As Brown, Durbin, and Evans (1975) argue for the recursive CUSUM test, these procedures can “be regarded as yardsticks for the interpretation of data rather than leading to hard and fast decisions.” Moreover, we will always be able to reject the nullhypothesis provided we have enough data at hand. The question is not whether the model is wrong (it always is!) but if the irregularities are serious. The package strucchange implements a variety of procedures related to structural change of the regression coefficients and was already introduced in R news by Zeileis (2001) and described in more detail in Zeileis, Leisch, Hornik, and Kleiber (2002). Therefore, we will focus on the package lmtest in the following. Most of the tests and the datasets contained in the package are taken from the book of Kramer and Sonnberger (1986), which originally inspired us to write the package. Compared to the book, we implemented later versions of some tests and modern flexible interfaces for the procedures. Most of the tests are based on the OLS residuals of a linear model, which is specified by a formula argument. Instead of a formula a fitted model of class lm can also be supplied, which should work if the data are either contained in the object or still present in the workspace—however this is not encouraged. The full references for the tests can be found on the help pages of the respective function. We present applications of the tests contained in lmtest to two different data sets: the first is a macroeconomic time series from the U.S. analysed by Stock and Watson (1996) and the second is data from a study on measurments of fetal mandible length discussed by Royston and Altman (1994).",W110315216,False,0.004842162597924471

An important result obtained by Ferguson in this approach is that if observations are made on a random variable whose distribution is a random sample function of a Dirichlet process, then the conditional distribution of the random measure can be easily calculated, and is again a Dirichlet process. This paper extends Ferguson's result to cases where the random measure is a mixing distribution for a parameter which determines the distribution from which observations are made. The conditional distribution of the random measure, given the observations, is no longer that of a simple Dirichlet process, but can be described as being a mixture of Dirichlet processes. This paper gives a formal definition for these mixtures and develops several theorems about their properties, the most important of which is a closure property for such mixtures.

First, a bit of background. Hubbell (2001) derived the analytical expression for the stochastic mean and variance of the abundance of a single arbitrary species in a neutral community undergoing immigration from a metacommunity source area. However, his approach did not lend itself to an analytical solution for the distribution of relative species abundance (RSA) in a multispecies community for community sizes larger than a handful of individuals. As a result, all of Hubbell's RSA distributions for local communities were based on simulations. This problem was solved by Volkov et al. (2003), who derived an analytical expression for the RSA distribution in local communities of arbitrary size. However, as Chisholm and Burgman noted, there is sometimes a difference between some of the simulation-based results of Hubbell and the analytical results of Volkov et al. (2003). Chisholm and Burgman computed Volkov's equation and resimulated Hubbell's results for the four cases",W2049424645,False,0.6865816712379456

https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/49.4.725,THE NUMBER OF ALLELES THAT CAN BE MAINTAINED IN A FINITE POPULATION,"T has sometimes been suggested that the wild-type allele is not a single entity, I but rather a population of different isoalleles that are indistinguishable by any ordinary procedure. With hundreds of nucleotides, each presumably capable of base substitutions and with additional permutations possible through sequence rearrangements, gains, and losses, the number of possible gene states becomes astronomical. It is known that a single nucleotide substitution can have the most drastic consequences, but there are also mutations with very minute effects and there is the possibility that many are so small as to be undetectable. It is not the purpose of this article to discuss the plausibility of such a system of isoalleles, or the evidence for and against. Instead, we propose to examine some of the population consequences of such a system if it does exist. The probability seems great enough to warrant such an inquiry. If a large number of different states can arise by mutation, this doesn't necessarily mean that a large fraction of these would coexist in a single population. Some will be lost by random drift and others may be selectively disadvantageous. On the other hand, some may persist by being beneficial in heterozygous combinations. We shall consider three possibilities: ( 1 ) A system of selectively neutral isoalleles whose frequency in the population is determined by the mutation rate and by random drift. (2) A system of mutually heterotic alleles. ( 3 ) A mixture of heterotic and harmful mutants.",W1853989166,False,0.18705131113529205

https://doi.org/10.1890/07-1206.1,NEW MULTIDIMENSIONAL FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY INDICES FOR A MULTIFACETED FRAMEWORK IN FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"Functional diversity is increasingly identified as an important driver of ecosystem functioning. Various indices have been proposed to measure the functional diversity of a community, but there is still no consensus on which are most suitable. Indeed, none of the existing indices meets all the criteria required for general use. The main criteria are that they must be designed to deal with several traits, take into account abundances, and measure all the facets of functional diversity. Here we propose three indices to quantify each facet of functional diversity for a community with species distributed in a multidimensional functional space: functional richness (volume of the functional space occupied by the community), functional evenness (regularity of the distribution of abundance in this volume), and functional divergence (divergence in the distribution of abundance in this volume). Functional richness is estimated using the existing convex hull volume index. The new functional evenness index is based on the minimum spanning tree which links all the species in the multidimensional functional space. Then this new index quantifies the regularity with which species abundances are distributed along the spanning tree. Functional divergence is measured using a novel index which quantifies how species diverge in their distances (weighted by their abundance) from the center of gravity in the functional space. We show that none of the indices meets all the criteria required for a functional diversity index, but instead we show that the set of three complementary indices meets these criteria. Through simulations of artificial data sets, we demonstrate that functional divergence and functional evenness are independent of species richness and that the three functional diversity indices are independent of each other. Overall, our study suggests that decomposition of functional diversity into its three primary components provides a meaningful framework for its quantification and for the classification of existing functional diversity indices. This decomposition has the potential to shed light on the role of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and on the influence of biotic and abiotic filters on the structure of species communities. Finally, we propose a general framework for applying these three functional diversity indices.",W1984188157,False,0.8638094663619995

These concepts are applied to functional characters to give three components of functional diversity – functional richness, functional evenness and functional divergence. We demonstrate how each of these components may be calculated.

Because clear generalisations about density effects on oviposition remain elusive, a better understanding of underlying mechanisms is needed. One such mechanism is plant‐mediated effects (i.e. changes in plant traits with density), which are often suggested but rarely isolated experimentally. In an experiment directly manipulating host plant density ( Solanum carolinense ) in the field, oviposition by a specialist herbivore ( Leptinotarsa juncta ) declined as plant density increased. A greenhouse cage experiment isolated the effects of plant‐mediated traits by removing neighbour plants before introducing L. juncta females. Oviposition declined as host plant density increased, supporting the importance of plant‐mediated effects in this system. To determine whether food quality contributed to plant‐mediated effects, larval growth rates were measured on leaves from both field‐ and greenhouse‐grown plants. In both the field and the greenhouse experiments, larval growth rate was not significantly affected by plant density. It is concluded that plant‐mediated effects contribute to, but do not completely explain, the strong influence of density on oviposition in the field experiment. These results suggest that considering plant‐mediated effects may help to explain variability in herbivore responses to plant density.",W1827942424,False,0.6325486898422241

,Theories of Populations in Biological Communities,"When we wrote this book it was, admittedly, flrst of all for the sake of our own enjoyment and enlightenment. We will, however, add our sincerely meant (but rather traditional) hope that it will prove interesting to graduate students, to colleagues and to anyone else, who will bother to read it. The book was written as a joint effort by a theoretically inclined population geneticist and an experimental ecologist who share opinions on what is interesting in the fleld of theoretical ecology. While we believe that qualifled natural history is of indisputable intrinsic value, we think that ecology is a natural science which should have a theoretical framework. On the other hand, theoretical ecology must draw its inspiration from nature and yield results which give insight into the flndings of the naturalist and inspire him to make new observations and experiments. Without this relationship between fleld biology and theory, mathematical ecology may become a discipline totally divorced from biology and solve-albeit interesting-mathematical problems without signiflcance for ecology. Therefore, in addition to theoretical population biology (including some original models) the book also discusses observational data from nature to show how the theoretical models give new insight and how observations give rise to new theoretical thought. While no book on ecology could do without the mention of the hare-lynx example (and ours is, therefore, no exception) we have tried to bring new examples mainly derived from one of the authors' fleld of experience: microbial ecology and marine biology.",W1513240596,False,0.7601335644721985

https://doi.org/10.1086/285185,On the Trophic Relations of Insects: A Food-Web Approach,"Trophic relations of 95 insect-dominated food webs from seven habitat categories are examined and discussed in relation to current ecological theory. We identify 13 salient patterns, of which fewer than half have been reported previously from other food-web studies. (1) Analysis of trophic links in the 61 community-type webs corroborate the well-known trend that trophic diversity of insects has increased over evolutionary time. (2) Numbers of saprophages and animal parasites follow a continuum ranging from grazer-based systems (plant-herbivore, gall) and parasitoid-poor systems (aquatic, carrion, phytotelmata, wood, dung) to habitats that are detritus-based (phytotelmata, rotting wood, carrion, dung) and parasitoid-rich (gall), respectively (3) Among trophic subsets of species that determine food-web shape, only proportions of bottom species in food chains are similar to values published previously. (4) Aquatic-terrestrial comparisons reveal that aquatic webs (including phytotelmata habitats) support a richer number of trophic modes, higher proportions of bottom species, more interactions per species, and a smaller proportion of specialist consumers than the latter. (5) Cannibalistic links are generally absent in most insect webs and uncommonly recorded in the remainder of these webs, a result consistent with other food-web studies. (6) Global patterns of connectance and link numbers per species in insect-rich webs are similar to other reports even in webs with fewer investigator-defined species. This finding suggests that web participants interact with each other in broadly similar ways and in small numbers (2 2 here vs. 1 99 elsewhere). (7) Global ratios of resources (prey) to consumers (predators) are smaller (1:2) than in other webs (7:8), which suggests that for every consumer in insect-rich systems roughly one less resource is included, on the average, in its diet (8) An earlier prediction of higher prey-to-predator ratios in sink webs than in community-type webs is generally supported here. (9) Monophagy is wide-spread across both insect consumers and habitats; conversely, most insect species appear to have no more than three local consumers. Aquatic webs are exceptions in the former case. (10) Most insect families (76%) are associated with only one habitat category; conversely, five families (e.g., ants, flesh flies) are habitat generalists, occurring in four habitat types (11) Tropical webs do not, on the average, have longer food chains than those in temperate or desert climates. (12) Upper limits in chain length vary from three in carrion systems to as many as seven in gall webs: this latter value exceeds suggested upper limits for insect feeding reported elsewhere. (13) Nearly half of all the insect taxa (families) have members that are top predators in certain habitats even after vertebrates are factored in. These latter two features underscore the important roles insects may play in natural communities, roles that reach beyond occupying merely the critical middle links in ecosystems or the occasional position of top predator in unusual places such as caves.",W1970429014,False,0.8425248861312866

Herbicides were applied to horsenettle infested fields with spray nozzles mounted beneath a 2.4 m wide sweep type plow operated about 20 cm below the soil surface. Crops were then planted. Picloram (4‐amino‐3,5,6‐trichloropicolinic acid) and dicamba (3,6‐dichloro‐ o ‐anisic acid) were successful for horsenettle control but severely injured broadleaved crops planted over the SSL. Dinitroaniline herbicides generally suppressed emergence of horsenettle plants up to 82 days. Postemergence treatments of 2,4‐DB [4‐(2,4‐dichlorophenoxy)butyric acid] plus SSL dinitroaniline treatments did not enhance horsenettle control above that achieved with 2,4‐DB alone.

Merr.), and peanuts ( Arachis hypogaea L.) when used SSL. Butralin [4‐(l,l‐dimethylethyl)‐N‐(1‐methylpropyl)‐2,6‐dinitrobenzemamine] caused the least yield reductions. Trifluralin was more soil persistent as a SSL than dinitramine (N 4 N 4 ‐diethyl‐α,αα‐trifluoro‐3,5‐dinitrotoluene‐2,4‐diamine). These two herbicides were also more persistent when applied deeper in the soil.",W2027235872,False,0.6495502591133118

https://doi.org/10.2307/2265793,Alternative Predator Avoidance Syndromes of Stream‐Dwelling Mayfly Larvae,"Experiments were conducted to compare the patterns, mechanisms, and costs of predator avoidance behavior among larvae of five species of mayflies that co—occur with the predatory stoneflies, Megarcys signata and Kogotus modestus in western Colorado streams. Mayfly drift dispersal behavior, use of high vs. low food (periphyton or detritus) patches, microhabitat use, positioning, and activity periodicity were observed in the presence and absence of predators in circular flow—through chambers using natural stream water. Also, distances from predators at which prey initiated escape responses were compared among prey and predator species. Costs of predator avoidance behavior were assessed by measuring short—term (24 h) feeding rates of mayflies in the presence or absence of predatory stoneflies whose mouthparts were immobilized (glued) to prevent feeding. The intensity and associated costs of predator avoidance behavior of mayfly species were consistent with their relative rates of predation by stoneflies. Megarcys consumes overwintering generation Baetis bicaudatus &gt; Epeorus longimanus &gt; Cinygmula = Ephemerella; Kogotus consumes summer generation Baetis &gt; Epeorus deceptivus = Cinygmula; Megarcys eats more mayflies than Kogotus. While Megarcys induced drift by Baetis, Epeorus, and Cinygmula, this disruptive predator avoidance behavior only reduced food intake by Baetis and Epeorus. The morphologically defended mayfly species, Ephemerella, neither showed escape behavior from Megarcys, nor any cost of its antipredatory posturing behavior. Only Baetis responded by drifting from Kogotus. No mayfly species shifted microhabitats or spent less time on high—food patches in the presence of foraging stoneflies. However, predators enhanced the nocturnal periodicity of Baetis drift, which was negligible in the absence of stoneflies as long as food was abundant. Lack of food also caused some microhabitat and periodicity shifts and increased the magnitude of both day and night drift of Baetis. Thus, Baetis took more risks of predation by visual, drift—feeding fish not only in the presence of predatory stoneflies, but also when food was low or they were hungry. All other mayflies were generally nocturnal in their use of rock surfaces, as long as food was abundant. Finally, the distances at which different mayfly species initiated acute escape responses were also consistent with relative rates of predation. This study demonstrates alternative predator avoidance syndromes by mayfly species ranging from an initial investment in constitutive morphological defenses (e.g., Ephemerella) to induced, energetically costly predator avoidance behaviors (e.g., Baetis). Although the costs of Ephemerella's constitutive defense are unknown, experiments show that prey dispersal is the mechanism underlying fecundity costs of induced responses by Baetis to predators, rather than microhabitat shifts to less favorable resources or temporal changes in foraging activity. A conceptual model suggests that contrasting resource acquisition modes may account for the evolution and maintenance of alternative predator avoidance syndromes along a continuum from Baetis (high mobility) to heptageniids (intermediate mobility) to Ephemerella (low mobility). Prey dispersal (swimming) to avoid capture results in reduction of otherwise high fecundity by Baetis, which trades off morphological defense for enhanced ability to acquire resources. Thus, improved foraging efficiency is the selection pressure maintaining the highly mobile life style in Baetis, which increases resource acquisition and fecundity, offsetting the high mortality costs associated with this behavior.",W1973040607,False,0.7527831792831421

Direct observations of the interactions between stoneflies and mayflies were made at Otter Creek, Sauk County, Wisconsin, USA and the East River, Gunnison County, Colorado, USA using plexiglass boxes with screen ends and an artificial substrate. Ephemerella subvaria and Stenonema fuscum, Otter Creek, avoided the stonefly predator Acroneuria lycorias given only noncontact chemical stimuli. Ephemerella infrequens and Baetis bicaudatus, East River, Responded to long—range chemical stimuli from Megarcys signata and Kogotus modestus, East River. Baetis phoebus and Heptagenia hebe, Otter Creek, and Cinygmula sp., East River, did not respond to stonefly predators given long—range chemical cues along. Differences among responses of different mayflies may be due to differential predation pressure or effectiveness of predator evasion tactics. None of the species of mayflies tested responded to the presence of stonefly predators given only visual stimuli. The Ephemerella species assumed a ""scorpion""—like display posture upon encounter with the stoneflies. This posture may increase the apparent size of the mayflies which are then rejected by the tactile predators. The Baetis species characteristically swam or drifted in response to contact with the stonefly predators. Predator evasion could partially explain the high incidence of this genus of mayflies reported in stream drift. The remaining mayflies, of the family Heptageniidae, showed an effective crawling evasion upon contact with stonefly predators. Ephemerella infrequens and B. bicaudatus differentially responded to contact with three different stonefly predators in the East River. Both species of mayflies evaded contact with Pteronarcella badia, a large omnivorous stonefly which morphologically resembles M. signata, significantly less frequently than they evaded M. signata and K. modestus upon contact. The mechanism by which this differentiation occurs could be chemotactile. Cinygmula sp. avoided all stoneflies equally regardless of size or relative threat of consumption. Tactile stimuli are probably responsible for this behavior.",W1990782929,False,0.7822444438934326

https://doi.org/10.2307/1467300,The Role of Disturbance in Stream Ecology,"We define disturbance in stream ecosystems to be: any relatively discrete event in time that is characterized by a frequency, intensity, and severity outside a predictable range, and that disrupts ecosystem, community, or population structure and changes resources or the physical environment. Of the three major hypotheses relating disturbance to lotic community structure, the dynamic equilibrium hypothesis appears to be generally applicable, although specific studies support the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and the equilibrium model. Differences in disturbance frequency between lentic and lotic systems may explain why biotic interactions are more apparent in lakes than in streams. Responses to both natural and anthropogenic disturbances vary regionally, as illustrated by examples from the mid-continent, Pacific northwest, and southeastern United States. Based on a generalized framework of climatic-biogeochemical characteristics, two features are considered to be most significant in choosing streams for comparative studies of disturbance: hydrologic regimes and comparable geomorphology. A method is described for quantifying predictability of the hydrologic regime based on long-term records of monthly maximum and minimum stream flows. Different channel forms (boulder and cobble, alluvial gravelbed, alluvial sandbed) have different responses to hydrologic disturbance from spates. A number of structural and functional components for comparing disturbance effects within regions and across biomes are presented. Experimental approaches to studying disturbance involve spatial-scale considerations, logistic difficulties, and ethical questions. General questions related to disturbance that could be addressed by stream ecologists are proposed.",W1968076659,False,0.6440756916999817

Our simulations reveal coevolution of victim mimicry and exploiter specialization in a saltational and reversible cycle. Evolution is gradual and directional only in the specialization phase of the cycle thereby implying that specialization itself is saltational in such systems.

The best-known examples come from insects and brood parasitic birds. Unfortunately, the term 'mimicry' is used indiscriminately and inconsistently in the brood parasitic literature despite the obvious fact that similarities of eggs, nestlings and adults of brood parasites to their hosts could result from many different processes (phylogenetic constraint, predation, intraspecific arms-races, vocal imitation, exploitation of pre-existing preferences, etc.). In this note I wish to plead for a more careful use of the term. I review various processes leading to a similarity between propagules (both eggs and nestlings) of brood parasites and their hosts and stress that: (1) mimetic and non-mimetic similarities should be differentiated, (2) a mere similarity of host and parasite propagules provides no evidence for mimicry, (3) mimicry is more usefully understood as a (coevolutionary) process rather than an appearance, and (4) mimicry terminology should reflect the process which led to mimetic similarity.

Brood parasites fill their armory with adaptations including exquisite egg mimicry, rapid laying, ejection of host eggs, murder of host young, chick mimicry and manipulative begging behavior: ploys shown by recent research to have evolved in response to host defense behavior or through competition among the parasites themselves. While many host species appear defenseless, accepting parasite eggs quite unlike their own, many are more discriminating against odd-looking eggs and some have evolved the ability to discriminate against odd-looking chicks as well. How is this arms race conducted? Will defenseless hosts develop defenses in time, or are there constraints which limit the evolution and perfection of host defenses? And why are so few species obliged only to lay eggs in host nests? Have host defenses limited the success of brood parasitism, or is it in fact much more common than we suspect, but occurring mainly when birds parasitize the nest of their own kind?

We investigated ATP-dependent and -independent vesicle acidification, monitored with fluorescent acridine orange, in a highly purified K(+)-transporting goblet cell apical membrane preparation of tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) midgut. ATP-dependent proton transport was shown to be catalyzed by a vacuolar-type ATPase as deduced from its sensitivity to submicromolar concentrations of bafilomycin A1. ATP-independent amiloride-sensitive proton transport into the vesicle interior was dependent on an outward-directed K+ gradient across the vesicle membrane. This K(+)-dependent proton transport may be interpreted as K+/H+ antiport because it exhibited the same sensitivity to amiloride and the same cation specificity as the K(+)-dependent dissipation of a pH gradient generated by the vacuolar-type proton pump. The vacuolar-type ATPase is exclusively a proton pump because it could acidify vesicles independent of the extravesicular K+ concentration, provided that the antiport was inhibited by amiloride. Polyclonal antibodies against the purified vacuolar-type ATPase inhibited ATPase activity and ATP-dependent proton transport, but not K+/H+ antiport, suggesting that the antiporter and the ATPase are two different molecular entities. Experiments in which fluorescent oxonol V was used as an indicator of a vesicle-interior positive membrane potential provided evidence for the electrogenicity of K+/H+ antiport and suggested that more than one H+ is exchanged for one K+ during a reaction cycle. Both the generation of the K+ gradient-dependent membrane potential and the vesicle acidification were sensitive to harmaline, a typical inhibitor of Na(+)-dependent transport processes including Na+/H+ antiport. Our results led to the hypothesis that active and electrogenic K+ secretion in the tobacco hornworm midgut results from electrogenic K+/nH+ antiport which is energized by the electrical component of the proton-motive force generated by the electrogenic vacuolar-type proton pump.",W1504256022,False,0.002739258110523224

It is present in the membranes of many organelles, where its proton-pumping action creates the low intra-vacuolar pH found, for example, in lysosomes. In addition, there are a number of differentiated cell types that have V-ATPases on their surface that contribute to the physiological functions of these cells. The V-ATPase is a multi-subunit enzyme composed of a membrane sector and a cytosolic catalytic sector. It is related to the familiar FoF1 ATP synthase (F-ATPase), having the same basic architectural construction, and many of the subunits from the two display identity with one another. All the core subunits of the V-ATPase have now been identified and much is known about the assembly, regulation and pharmacology of the enzyme.

https://doi.org/10.5860/choice.31-0917,The hot-blooded insects: strategies and mechanisms of thermoregulation,"Bernd Heinrich's widely praised Bumblebee Economics (Harvard, 1979) set a high standard for scientifically accurate yet gracefully articulate writing about nature's ingenious patterns, specifically thermoregulation. His Hot-Blooded Insects takes a giant step forward by presenting an overview of what is now known about thermoregulation in all of the major insect groups, offering new insights on physiology, ecology, and evolution. The book is richly illustrated by the author's exquisite sketches. By describing the environmental opportunities and challenges faced by moths and butterflies, grasshoppers and locusts, dungball rollers and other beetles, a wide range of bees, and other insects, Heinrich explains their dazzling variety of physiological and behavioral adaptations to what, for them, is a world of violent extremes in temperature. These mechanisms are apparent only through precise observations, but the small body size of insects poses large technical difficulties in whole-animal experiments, engendering controversy about the reliability of the data thus derived. Emphasizing an experimental approach, Heinrich pinpoints where he believes studies have gone astray, describing in detail both groundbreaking experiments and those which leave a reasonable doubt about the mechanism being interpreted. He reviews relevant work on the major taxa to show the underlying patterns that draw diversity together, opines on current controversies, and identifies questions that call for further study. Physiologists, ecologists, entomologists, and zoologists - in fact, all biologists - will be stimulated and challenged to further research by this masterly synthesis of a new field; it will also appeal toinformed readers interested in general science.",W1514837587,False,0.3792174160480499

In addition fractional turnovers of the body pools have been estimated by fitting curves to the sequential log-converted isotope enrichment against time. By manipulation of data collected in the field in a study of metabolism of vespertilionid bats, it is shown the curve-fitting technique results in an accurate estimate of CO2 production only when the rate of CO2 production is constant. Biologically realistic nonsteady-state conditions result in errors in estimates of CO2 production of up to 30%. In conditions where CO2 production is known to be temporally variable, the more traditional two-sample method may provide a more accurate estimate of CO2 production.",W1589275044,False,0.40269941091537476

Colonial living is characterized by division of labour and finely coordinated organization, by reproductive function being limited to certain individuals, by cooperative brood care, and by the presence of non-reproductive workers. Within a colony, however, many events are the result of conflicts between individuals seeking to maximize their own interests. Ever since Darwin, this interplay of cooperation and conflict has raised many important questions in evolutionary biology, especially about how cooperative behaviour is maintained in the absence of direct reproduction by workers. How is the heritable component of this behaviour passed on? Crozier and Pamilo's contribution is to analyse the genetic basis of the patterns of reproduction and resource allocation found in social insect colonies. This is done more comprehensively and with greater depth and insight than in any previous study, and is a significant step forward in the fields of population genetics and social evolution.",W1947881253,False,0.0038330969400703907

,Environmental forcing and genetic differentiation in subdivided populations,"Questions: How will genetic differentiation and genetic drift in spatially structured populations be affected by different classes of autocorrelated environmental noise? How does dispersal interact with fluctuations generated from the demographic and environmental forcing in shaping the neutral genetic patterns? Model and key assumptions: Populations are regulated locally by density-dependent feedback including demographic stochasticity but they are also here forced by environmental noise (white, red, and blue noise corresponding to random, positive, and negative autocorrelation respectively). Spatial structure consists of a looped string of populations connected by dispersal and each with a predefined carrying capacity (one-dimensional stepping stone structure). Method: Simulations initialized by randomly distributing individuals, and thus genotypes, in space (no fitness differences, no mutation, no recombination, no selection). Conclusions: In an unpredictable way, red noise reinforces the genetic differentiation among populations more than white or blue noise. Dispersal appears unable to dilute the differentiation effect of positively autocorrelated forcing. In modelling the effect of environmental stochasticity, details about the type of environmental noise are of paramount importance for the results and their biological and management implications.",W1491127029,False,0.3314606249332428

Although one‐tailed hypothesis tests are commonly used, clear justification for why this approach is used is often missing from published papers. 2. Here we suggest explicit questions authors should ask of themselves when deciding whether or not to adopt one‐tailed tests. 3. First, we suggest that authors should only use a one‐tailed test if they can explain why they are more interested in an effect in one direction and not the other. 4. We suggest a further requirement that adoption of one‐tailed testing requires an explanation why the authors would treat a large observed difference in the unexpected direction no differently from a difference in the expected direction that was not strong enough to justify rejection of the null hypothesis. 5. These justifications should be included in published works that use one‐tailed tests, allowing editors, reviewers and readers the ability to evaluate the appropriateness of the adoption of one‐tailed testing. 6. We feel that adherence to our suggestions will allow authors to use one‐tailed tests more appropriately, and readers to form their own opinion about such appropriateness when one‐tailed tests are used.",W1563749973,False,0.32928577065467834

Two of three second stages operated in parallel were inoculated by a bacterivorous flagellate, Bodo saltans, and an algivorous ciliate, Urotricha furcata, respectively. The third vessel served as a control. In two experiments, where algal and bacterial populations grew at rates and densities typical for eutrophic waters, we compared community changes of bacteria, algae, and protozoa under quasi-steady-state conditions and during the transient stage after the protozoan inoculation. In situ hybridization with fluorescent oligonucleotide probes and cultivation-based approaches were used to tentatively analyze the bacterial community composition. Initially the cell size distribution and community structure of all cultivation vessels showed similar patterns, with a dominance of 1- to 2.5-(mu)m-long rods from the beta subdivision of the phylum Proteobacteria ((beta)-Proteobacteria). Inoculation with the ciliate increased bacterial growth in this substrate-controlled variant, seemingly via a recycling of nutrients and substrate released by grazing on algae, but without any detectable effect on the composition of bacterial assemblage. In contrast, an inoculation with the bacterivore, B. saltans, resulted in a decreased proportion of the (beta)-Proteobacteria. One part of the assemblage (&lt;4% of total bacterial numbers), moreover, produced large grazing-resistant threadlike cells. As B. saltans ingested only cells of &lt;3 (mu)m, this strategy yielded a refuge for (symbl)70% of total bacterial biomass from being grazed. Another consequence of the heavy predation in this variant was a shift to the numerical dominance of the (alpha)-Proteobacteria. The enhanced physiological status of the heavily grazed-upon segment of bacterial community resulted in a much higher proportion of CFU (mean, 88% of total bacterial counts) than with other variants, where CFU accounted for (symbl)30%. However, significant cultivation-dependent shifts of the bacterial community were observed toward (gamma)-Proteobacteria and members of the Cytophaga/Flavobacterium group, which demonstrated the rather poor agreement between cultivation-based approaches and oligonucleotide probing.",W1502514157,False,0.7562665343284607

Methods A total of 484 patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology criteria for knee OA were enrolled in this 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study group with 3 diacerein dosages of 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, and 150 mg/day (administered twice daily). Results In the intent-to-treat population, 100 mg/day diacerein (50 mg twice daily) was significantly superior (P < 0.05) to placebo using the primary criterion (visual analog scale [VAS] assessment of pain on movement). Significant improvement (P < 0.05) was also observed for the secondary criteria, which included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA Index (WOMAC), the WOMAC subscores, and the VAS assessment of handicap. In patients treated with diacerein dosages of 50 mg/day and 150 mg/day, favorable but not significant results were observed for the primary criterion. The best daily dosage of diacerein, calculated from the effect on the VAS assessment of pain on movement, was 90.1 mg. In the per-protocol population, the analysis of the primary criterion showed significant dose-dependent differences (P < 0.05) between each of the 3 diacerein dosages and the placebo. No differences were observed among the 3 diacerein groups. A significantly higher incidence (P < 0.05) of adverse events (AEs), as well as a higher rate of dropoout due to AEs, was observed in patients treated with 150 mg/day diacerein versus those treated with placebo, 50 mg/day diacerein, or 100 mg/day diacerein. Mild-to-moderate transient changes in bowel habits were the most frequent AEs, increasing with the dosage. Conclusion Diacerein, a drug for the treatment of OA, was shown to be an effective treatment for symptoms in patients with knee OA. Taking into account both efficacy and safety, the optimal daily dosage of diacerein for patients with knee OA is 100 mg/day (50 mg twice daily).",W1968820165,False,0.03374209254980087

While there are difficulties in interpreting these P-values, I argue that, in principle, one should prefer the latter.

Part I covers the mathematical background and computer programming, and then uses a paradigm of foraging under risk of predation to exemplify the general modeling technique. Part II consists of five applied chapters illustrating the scope of the dynamic modeling approach. They treat hunting behavior in lions, reproduction in insects, migrations of aquatic organisms, clutch size and parental care in birds, and movement of spiders and raptors.

Pulmonate snails (Physella gyrina) were placed into experimental pools and exposed to four levels of predation risk while holding their density constant. Periphyton resources were made available in two habitats: open and covered. I hypothesized that a behavioral response by snails to predation risk would influence periphyton standing crop in the open and covered habitats. Snails responded to increasing predation risk by moving into safer (covered) habitats, and the magnitude of their response was sensitive to the actual level of risk: intermediate levels of risk resulted in intermediate habitat use. However, use of the risky (open) habitat by snails was time dependent Snails initially responded strongly to predation risk, but they exhibited similar patterns of habitat use at all risk levels by the end of the experiment Periphyton standing crop was positively related to predation risk. In contrast to snail habitat use, this response was initially weak and became stronger as the experiment progressed. Thus, the short-and long-term responses of snail habitat use and periphyton standing crop contrasted sharply. I suggest that the changing patterns of snail habitat use over time are consistent with the idea that snails balance predation risk against foraging gains when selecting habitats and that the manner in which they balance foraging gains and predation risk determines the pattern of periphyton standing crops across habitats",W1974032446,False,0.5885913968086243

,Group selection in predator-prey communities.,"Many animals regulate their population density by patterns of behavior that would be easy to explain if the forces of natural selection acted to optimize group properties. But Darwinian selection acts on individuals, not groups, and most simple theories have shown group selection to be too slow ever to oppose individual selection successfully. In this book Michael Gilpin presents a model, based on predator-prey dynamics, wherein nonlinear effects are important, so that small advantages to the selfish individual are nonlinearly amplified into disaster for his group. The result is that group selection can be rapid and powerful. Of course many instances of apparent group selection can be explained by kin selection; in other cases, close examination reveals that seemingly altruistic behavior directly benefits the individual genotype as well as the group. The value of the monograph is that it provides a robust model in which group selection, pure and unadulterated, can be seen to work.",W1585956443,False,0.6406881213188171

Unlike most previous studies, our models assume that growth rate is an adaptively flexible character that can be increased at the expense of a greater juvenile mortality rate. Three components of fitness are considered: the cost of developing at a suboptimal time of the year, the reproductive advantage of larger adult size, and the increased mortality from rapid juvenile growth. The study focuses on the optimal responses of size, development time, and growth rate to changes in the amount of time available for completion of the life cycle. The models show that the optimal growth rate and size at maturity may respond in several different ways. Perhaps the most likely effect is that growth becomes faster and size smaller with less time available. It is also possible, however, for either growth rate or size (but not both) to stay constant; in other cases, less time available leads to slower growth or larger size. The effects of increased mortality on the juvenile stage are also explored; here, the optimal size is likely to decrease, but growth rate and development time may increase or decrease.",W1980294991,False,0.5142588019371033

In a series of microcosm experiments I empirically derived the functional response curves for two common types of stream predators, sculpins (Cottus bairdi) and stonefly larvae (Agnetina capitata), on two behaviorally and morphologically distinct types of mayfly prey (Baetis tricaudatus and Ephemerella subvaria). Data from these separate trials were combined using simple additive models to generate predicted combined functional responses for both types of predator. For both types of prey, actual combined functional response curves (both types of predators together in a treatment) differed significantly from predicted combined functional response for some ranges of prey densities. When Baetis was used as prey, significant departures from the predicted values occurred at moderate and high prey densities and were in a negative direction (interference between predators). When Ephemerella was the prey, significant departures occurred at low and moderate densities and were in a positive direction (facilitation between predators). Additive models for predicting combined predator effects cannot account for non—linearities in combined functional response introduced by non—trophic (behavioral) interactions that occur between fish and stoneflies, and between these predators and their prey. Other aquatic and terrestrial food webs contain similar linkages between vertebrate and invertebrate predators and their prey.

We argue that the observed differences in developmental plasticity, heriisbilities and genetic covariances of traits among localities result from differential selection pressures in each environment, and are related to the physiological constraints inherent in development and to the degree of compromise between the timing and size at metamorphosis allowed in each environment. In Maryland populations fitness has been maximized by evolutionary changes in size alone; body size in this population is canalized, has low heritability and is highly correlated with juvenile survival relative to developmental time. In Canada, minimum developmental time yields maximum fitness; the length of the larval period in this population is canalized and genetically monomorphic relative to body size. In contrast, fitness in the Virginia populations has been determined by correlated and pleiotropic effects of genes on both developmental time and larval body size, and both traits are equally canalized, affect juvenile survivorship equally and display moderate heritabilities. These results stress the importance of interpreting variation in life-history traits relative to constraints inherent in development and those imposed by the environment. Heritability and survivorship data support the general notion that fitness traits should have low levels of additive genetic variation, but also suggest that antagonistic pleiotropy may act to preserve genetic variation in fitness traits under simultaneous selection, and caution against inferring evolutionary importance of individual traits without considering the possible presence of pleiotropy.",W1987468432,False,0.8725529909133911

E-mail: jstach@uconnvm.uconn.edu **School of Biology, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332-0230, USA ABSTRACT: Direct effects of predation have been widely recognized as important in affecting prey population dynamics and evolution. However, less attention has been devoted to the consequences of indirect effects of predators on prey behavior. For example, to avoid predation many animals restrict their activities to physical refugia and adopt low-mobility lifestyles, yet the consequences of these anti-predator behaviors for foraging and diet selection are relatively unknown. In this study we examine the relationships between mobility, feeding preferences, and compensatory feeding for 3 species of marine decapod crabs feeding on seaweeds in North Carolina, USA. Low mobility and high site fidelity of crabs were associated with a broad, non-selective diet and compensatory feeding. The majid Mithrax forceps exhibited the lowest mobility, highest site fidelity, and least selective diet of the 3 species, whereas another majid Libinia dubia was intermediate in both mobility and selectivity, and the xanthid Panopeus herbstii had the greatest mobility and narrowest diet. Of these 3 crabs, only M. forceps compensated for low food quality by increasing consumption rates in single food-species feeding assays. This may be because M. forceps is resistant to (or tolerant of) seaweed chemical defenses, while other crab species are not. The ability to consume, and presumably subsist on, a wide variety of potential foods including those defended from more mobile consumers may facilitate a low-mobility lifestyle, allowing the crab to minimize movement and reduce exposure to predators. Low mobility and high site-fidelity may thus facilitate the formation and use of associational refuges with sessile benthic organisms that are resistant to predators; these associations can have important community and ecosystem-wide consequences.

Our study focuses on the history of cattle domestication including the last 60 years of B. taurus breeding programmes in both favourable and unfavourable environments and its consequences on evolution and fitness of cattle. We discuss the emergence of ‘production diseases’ in temperate production systems and consider the evolutionary genetics of tropical adaptation in cattle and conclude that the Senepol, N’Dama, Adaptaur and Criollo breeds, among others with similar evolutionary trajectories, would possess genes capable of improving the productivity of cattle in challenging environments. Using our own experimental evidence from northern Australia, we review the evolution of the Adaptaur cattle breed which has become resistant to cattle tick. We emphasize that the knowledge of interactions between genotype, environment and management in the livestock systems will be required to generate genotypes for efficient livestock production that are both economically and environmentally sustainable. Livestock producers in the 21st century will have less reliance on infrastructure and veterinary products to alleviate environmental stress and more on the animal’s ability to achieve fitness in a given production environment.",W1498457752,False,0.8483763933181763

While it is generally accepted in medical, veterinary and agricultural contexts that variation in host resistance and pathogen virulence and aggressiveness is of central importance to understanding patterns of infection, there has been remarkably little effort to directly investigate causal links between population genetic structure and disease dynamics, and even less work on factors influencing host–pathogen coevolution. The lack of empirical evidence is particularly surprising, given the potential for such variation to not only affect disease dynamics and prevalence, but also when or where new diseases or pathotypes emerge. Increasingly, this lack of knowledge has led to calls for an integrated approach to disease management, incorporating both ecological and evolutionary processes. Here, we argue that plant pathogens occurring in agro‐ecosystems represent one clear example where the application of evolutionary principles to disease management would be of great benefit, as well as providing model systems for advancing our ability to generalize about the long‐term coevolutionary dynamics of host–pathogen systems. We suggest that this is particularly the case given that agro‐ecological host–pathogen interactions represent a diversity of situations ranging from those that only involve agricultural crops through to those that also include weedy crop relatives or even unrelated native plant communities. We begin by examining some of the criteria that are important in determining involvement in agricultural pathogen evolution by noncrop plants. Throughout we use empirical examples to illustrate the fact that different processes may dominate in different systems, and suggest that consideration of life history and spatial structure are central to understanding dynamics and direction of the interaction. We then discuss the implications that such interactions have for disease management in agro‐ecosystems and how we can influence those outcomes. Finally, we identify several major gaps where future research could increase our ability to utilize evolutionary principles in managing disease in agro‐ecosystems.",W1531458822,False,0.11573014408349991

The highest complexity of v‐phenotype was recognized in isolate DEG2, which overcomes resistance in cv. Mariska (R18) and line CS‐RL ( L. serriola × L. sativa, R18 +?), until now known as resistant to all known races of B. lactucae in Europe. However, some sparse sporulation also occurred on cv. Titan ( Dm 6 + R36). The isolates SR2 and SAW1 overcome the resistance based on the gene R36, but are avirulent to R18. The v‐phenotype of SR2 is highly complex with the most important v‐factors being present except for v14 and v18. The isolate FS1 is the first in Germany originating from a cultivar with R18 (cv. Samourai). The search for efficient sources of resistance in 64 accessions of 11 wild Lactuca spp. and primitive forms of L. sativa showed broad variation in accession–isolate interactions. Expression of race‐specific resistance in wild Lactuca spp. ( L. serriola, L. viminea, L. virosa ) was recorded frequently. Lactuca indica and L. saligna could be considered as the most efficient sources of resistance against isolates FS1, SR2 and SAW1. The isolate DEG2 showed the highest level of virulence. On seedlings of L. saligna, which is considered as a most important source of resistance against B. lactucae, there was frequently recorded limited sporulation, however this response cannot be considered as a susceptible. Except for some L. saligna accessions (CGN 05310 and CGN 05315), the resistance to all studied isolates was only observed in one accession of L. serriola (PI 253467).",W1552166549,False,0.5334283709526062

This study examined the health records of 45,497 calves over a 20-yr period to determine environmental and genetic factors influencing the incidence of IBK. Three data sets were analyzed with an animal model. The first data set (n = 41,986) evaluated environmental factors and genetic differences among nine purebred (Angus, Braunvieh, Charolais, Gelbvieh, Hereford, Limousin, Pinzgauer, Red Poll, and Simmental) and three composite breeds (MARC I, MARC II, and MARC III). Weaning weights of calves diagnosed with IBK were 8.9 kg lighter (P < 0.05) than weights of healthy calves. Incidence of IBK was related to age of the calf and the seasonal life cycle of the face fly (Musca autumnalis). Incidence of IBK increased in the spring (June), peaked during the summer months (July to September), and then decreased in the fall. Herefords were the most susceptible breed (P < 0.05) compared with all other purebreds and composites. Estimates of direct heritability for the incidence of IBK were generally low and ranged from 0.00 to 0.28 by breed. The maternal permanent environmental and genetic effects of the dam on the incidence of IBK were not significant for most breeds. The second data set (n = 9,606) was used to estimate heterosis for the incidence of IBK from a Hereford and Angus diallel design. The heterosis effect for the incidence of IBK in reciprocal Hereford/Angus crossbred calves was slightly negative (P = 0.12) but not large. The higher incidence of IBK in Angus × Hereford calves compared with Hereford × Angus calves (13.3 vs. 8.9%) suggests a maternal effect related to the incidence of IBK. Incidence of IBK in crossbred calves sired by tropically adapted breeds (Brahma, Boran, Tuli) compared with purebred and crossbred Bos taurus types was investigated in the third data set (n = 2,622). Crossbred calves sired by tropically adapted breeds had a lower incidence of IBK than most Bos taurus types (P < 0.05), but they were not different than either reciprocal crosses of Hereford and Angus or purebred Angus calves. Response to selection for decreasing the incidence of IBK is likely to be slow because of low heritability and low incidence in most breeds. Significant breed differences for incidence of IBK may be important to some producers and management systems.",W1547030491,False,0.3113183081150055

Breed effects were evaluated for the nine parental breeds (Red Poll, Hereford, Angus, Limousin, Braunvieh, Pinzgauer, Gelbvieh, Simmental, and Charolais) that contributed to the three composite populations. Breed effects were significant for all traits evaluated except survival at birth. The large differences among breeds in additive direct and additive maternal genetic effects offer a great opportunity to use the genetic differences among breeds to achieve and maintain optimum additive genetic (breed) composition to match genetic resources to a wide range of production-marketing ecosystems. There was no heterosis for gestation length. Mean heterosis for dystocia was significant estimated in F1 but not in F2 or in the combined F3 and F4 generations. Mean heterosis was not significant in any generation for survival at birth, to 72 h, and to weaning for the F1 generation; mean heterosis was significant for survival to weaning for the F2 generation and approached significance (P =.06) for the combined F3 and F4 generations. Mean heterosis over all composite populations and heterosis for each composite population were significant in all generations for weight at birth and at 200 d and for ADG from birth to weaning. Retained heterosis was not less than expected from retained heterozygosity in composite populations for the traits evaluated. These results suggest that heterosis for these traits likely is due to dominance effects and, thus, can be attributed to the recovery of accumulated inbreeding depression in the parental breeds.",W123411266,False,0.19575588405132294

Three lines were selected for 1) weaning weight (WWL), 2) yearling weight (YWL), and 3) an index of yearling weight and muscle score (IXL). The fourth line was an unselected control line (CTL). Numbers of observations ranged from 1,699 (CTL) to 2,811 (WWL), and number of animals in the pedigree file ranged from 2,266 to 3,192. Two animal models were used to obtain estimates by REML using an average information method. Model 1 included random direct and maternal genetic, permanent maternal environmental, and residual environmental effects, and fixed sex × year effects. Model 2 additionally included random grandmaternal genetic and permanent grandmaternal environmental effects. For birth weight, Models 1 and 2 gave almost identical estimates for direct and maternal heritability, and for the fraction of variance that was due to maternal permanent environmental effects. Estimates for grandmaternal heritability could be obtained only for IXL (.03) and CTL (.01). For weaning weight, estimates for direct heritability were similar from both models. Estimates for maternal heritability from Model 1 were.18,.20,.13, and.20, and corresponding estimates from Model 2 were.34,.31,.13, and.34 for WWL, YWL, IXL, and CTL, respectively. For IXL, estimates for variances that were due to grandmaternal genetic and grandmaternal permanent environmental variances could not be obtained and were set to zero. Grandmaternal heritability estimates for WWL, YWL, and CTL were.05,.09, and.12.

https://doi.org/10.1163/156853966x00164,Variations in Territorial Behavior of Uganda Kob Adenota Kob Thomasi (Neumann 1896),"Territorial behavior of the Uganda kob (Adenota kob thomasi; Reduncini, Hippotraginae) was studied in the Toro Game Reserve, western Uganda. Two types of territories were found: (a) small individual plots, 15-30 m in diameter, aggregated in tight clusters that are called leks, arenas, or territorial breeding grounds (TGs) ; (b) larger territories of 100-200 m diameter, distributed between the arenas, called single territories (STs). The largely permanent TGs, to which most of the breeding is confined, provide the basis for a social organization of the kob population of ca. 15 000. A certain number of kob are, by tradition, attached to a particular TG, so that the total population is subdivided into units, each associated with one TG. STs are spread out between the TGs; their size, number, and distribution vary with season and local conditions. There is an irregular gradient in size and density of territories from the center of a TG through the STs in its vicinity. STs may be aggregated in loose clusters used as temporary or seasonal TGs. Permanent TGs may arise from such clusters. Abandonment of existing and formation of new TGs are relatively rare. The males on the STs are strongly attached to confined areas which they defend against intruding males. Competition for STs is not intense, but males are occasionally replaced. Males defeated from their STs join a male herd and may attempt later to reoccupy the same ST, often successfully. Whistling probably serves for marking the territory or for attracting females to it. Herds of females often pass through or stay on STs, but the males do not possess harems. They court the female and attempt to copulate with them, but most females avoid their approaches. Few copulations occur on the STs; in several cases the females involved proved to be physiologically abnormal, and it is concluded that the males on STs do not contribute significantly to the reproduction of the population. The daily activity of males on the STs is compared with that of males on TGs. The latter spend less time for feeding and have less food available on their territories; this, combined with the higher proportions of fighting and sexual behavior on TGs, is propably the main reason for the much higher rate of interchange of males on TGs compared with STs. Also, the degree of competition for territories is higher on TGs than STS. The males of the kob population studied are, on the whole, divided into two categories: Those frequenting TGs, and those staying on STs. Both types join a male herd when they are not territorial. The age distribution among males on TGs and those on STs is largely equal. Some males occupied both territories on a TG and STs, but such cases are relatively rare. Two young-adult males first occupied a ST for some time, before they appeared on a TG, but this course of behavioral development does not seem to be the general rule. Territorial behavior was found in several other kob populations; the relative number of STs and the development of TGs vary considerably between different areas. Territoriality and lek behavior in other ungulates are briefly reviewed. The Uganda kob is the only antelope known, so far, to exhibit typical lek behavior. In addition, behavioral polymorphism such as the occurrence of different types of territories within the same population has not yet been found in any other species of antelopes. The following conclusions pertaining to the Uganda kob are drawn: STs are the original form of territoriality, still prevalent in small or marginal populations. In large and dense populations the formation of TGs offers certain ecologic advantages, such as providing a social organization and a spacing mechanism to the population and ensuring maximum efficiency of reproduction. Despite these advantages of TGs over STs the latter have not disappeared. Either they provide some social advantage, as yet unknown, or their persistence ensures adaptive plasticity of local populations and the species as a whole, to meet emergencies brought about by changes in the environment.",W1967608524,False,0.8410643935203552

The growing body of modelling, descriptive and experimental studies on facilitation covers a wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic systems throughout the globe. However, the lack of a general body of theory linking facilitation among different types of organisms and biomes and their responses to environmental changes prevents further advances in our knowledge regarding the evolutionary and ecological implications of facilitation in plant communities. Moreover, insights gathered from alternative lines of inquiry may substantially improve our understanding of facilitation, but these have been largely neglected thus far. Despite over 15 years of research and debate on this topic, there is no consensus on the degree to which plant-plant interactions change predictably along environmental gradients (i.e. the stress-gradient hypothesis), and this hinders our ability to predict how plant-plant interactions may affect the response of plant communities to ongoing global environmental change. The existing controversies regarding the response of plant-plant interactions across environmental gradients can be reconciled when clearly considering and determining the species-specificity of the response, the functional or individual stress type, and the scale of interest (pairwise interactions or community-level response). Here, we introduce a theoretical framework to do this, supported by multiple lines of empirical evidence. We also discuss current gaps in our knowledge regarding how plant-plant interactions change along environmental gradients. These include the existence of thresholds in the amount of species-specific stress that a benefactor can alleviate, the linearity or non-linearity of the response of pairwise interactions across distance from the ecological optimum of the beneficiary, and the need to explore further how frequent interactions among multiple species are and how they change across different environments. We review the latest advances in these topics and provide new approaches to fill current gaps in our knowledge. We also apply our theoretical framework to advance our knowledge on the evolutionary aspects of plant facilitation, and the relative importance of facilitation, in comparison with other ecological processes, for maintaining ecosystem structure, functioning and dynamics. We build links between these topics and related fields, such as ecological restoration, woody encroachment, invasion ecology, ecological modelling and biodiversity-ecosystem-functioning relationships. By identifying commonalities and insights from alternative lines of research, we further advance our understanding of facilitation and provide testable hypotheses regarding the role of (positive) biotic interactions in the maintenance of biodiversity and the response of ecological communities to ongoing environmental changes.",W1581202351,False,0.8674461841583252

Many studies have explored how plant interactions vary along environmental gradients, and these relationships are fundamental to the many ideas in vegetation dynamics. 2. It has been argued that studies should differentiate between the intensity (absolute effect) and importance (relative effect) of a process, and several important indices have been presented in the literature. 3. We explore the mathematical properties of one of the most popular of these indices ( C imp ) and demonstrate that it is (i) insensitive to the underlying ecology, (ii) highly constrained, so making statistical analysis difficult and (iii) can have more complex behaviour than the processes it seeks to summarise. 4. We demonstrate that the positive relationship between C imp and productivity, which has been used to support the ideas of Grime, is entirely predictable without any information on competition and how it affects plant performance. 5. The properties of three other competition indices (ACI, RCI and lnRR) in relation to habitat productivity are briefly presented. ACI is closely related to C imp and so shares many of its properties, see Summary point 3 above. 6. An alternative method of analysing variation in plant performance on environmental gradients is then presented. This approach, which is based on a variance decomposition, is easy to implement and has a simple biological interpretation. 7. Synthesis. We strongly discourage the use of heuristic indices in ecological research. The majority of the 50 or so indices that have been used in competition studies have been developed with little or no regard to underlying theory or models. However, it is possible to make predictions about how competition varies along gradients from models that translate into both qualitative and quantitative conditions and metrics, and we encourage authors to do this.",W1537962871,False,0.8780286908149719

Experimental simulation of heat waves requires knowledge of regional heat wave characteristics, as plant responses depend heavily on meteorological conditions. We analysed nine Western European meteorological datasets, and found that heat waves occurring during the growing season in this region encompass more sunshine (+ 69%), lower precipitation (−78%) and a larger vapour pressure deficit (VPD) (+ 111%) compared with normal conditions. Possible consequences for plant responses are discussed, with emphasis on the likely seasonal variation of heat wave impacts. We explain why infrared heating (which typically increases VPD) is an appropriate technique for heat wave simulation.

(2009),"a recent paper by ourselves in this journal (Brooker & Kikvidze 2008) as well as our earlier work on competition importance (Brooker et al. 2005).In response, here we clarify our ideas with the aim of defining more clearly the key points of scientific debate, specifically (i) the definition of the importance of competition and (ii) its measurement.2. Freckleton, Watkinson & Rees (2009) interpret the classic paper by Welden & Slauson (1986) such that importance as a concept relates to long-term, population-level consequences of competition.However, we consider competition importance to be the proportional impact of competition relative to the overall impact of the environment, and our index C imp expresses changes in competition importance -as defined by ourselves -along productivity gradients.We argue that our definition more accurately reflects the work of Welden & Slauson, as well as a more recent use of the concept (Grace 1991), which precedes the work of Freckleton & Watkinson (2001).3. We highlight that C imp was never proposed as a general index of competition importance, but is readily applicable in certain circumstances.Notably, our index and the approaches to measuring competition importance as set out by Freckleton, Watkinson & Rees (2009) are not unrelated.4. We also discuss some recent additional responses to both our (2008) paper and that by Freckleton, Watkinson & Rees (2009), including applications of the concept of competition importance.Although the authors of these papers may not have used our index C imp, they follow the same definitions for the overall concept of competition importance as ourselves.5. Synthesis.We conclude that the complex topic of biotic interactions, including the specific issue of the importance of competition, invites a range of approaches.Importantly, these approaches can be complementary and not conflicting.Here, we propose what we see as a sensible resolution to the current debate concerning the definition of competition importance, a resolution which is backed by the original source article, literature precedent and current usage.",W1902441142,False,0.5799781084060669

This paper presents a global analysis of forest area affected by fire, significant insect pest outbreaks, diseases and severe weather reported by countries as part of the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Between 2003 and 2012, approximately 67 million hectares (1.7%) of forest land burned annually, mostly in tropical South America and Africa. In a similar reporting period, in total 142 million hectares of forest land were affected by other disturbances than fire. Insect pests affected more than 85 million hectares of forest, of which a major part was in temperate North America. Severe weather disturbed over 38 million hectares, mostly in Asia. About 12.5 million hectares were reported to be disturbed by diseases, mostly in Asia and Europe. There were strong correlations between burned forest area and the area of partial canopy cover reduction, as well as between burned forest area and net forest loss. Partial canopy cover reduction is used as a proxy for forest degradation, although it also includes land under management that is not degraded. A decreasing trend in burned forest area was found, largely accounted for by decreased area burned within the last ten years in tropical South America. However, an increasing trend in burned forest area was found in the boreal climatic domain. The data on other disturbances was not suitable for determining any year on year correlations and should be improved in future data collection exercises.",W1213549907,False,0.37285158038139343

This study contributes to the ongoing discussion regarding the future of Fagus as a major component of central European forests. Location: The drought limit of F. sylvatica at its ecotone with forest dominated by Quercus pubescens, Q. petraea and their hybrids in two limestone regions (Klettgau, Schwäbische Alb) in southwestern Germany was compared. Methods: Vegetation relevés were classified and a gradient analysis was performed. The vegetation pattern was analysed with several drought relevant variables. Classification trees were used to determine the drought limits of the Fagus forest. Results: The Fagus, Quercus and the ecotone forests were floristically characterized. The lower humidity in the submontane Klettgau, compared to the montane Schwäbische Alb, was compensated for by greater soil moisture (ASWSC). Therefore, Fagus forest in the Schwäbische Alb grew on sites with ASWSC values similar to those of ecotone forest in Klettgau. Conclusions: The interaction between climatic and edaphic drought related factors demonstrates that drought is a complex edaphic‐climatic factor. Both components contribute to limiting the distribution of Fagus. For the two regions in southwestern Germany, and under the existing climatic conditions, it could be shown that Fagus is able to dominate forests on soils with very low ASWSC (≥ 68 l.m ‐2 ).",W1954584211,False,0.8635661602020264

This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of methods and investigates whether errors in model predictions are associated to specific kinds of geographical and environmental distributions of species. Location Portugal, Western Europe. Methods Probabilities of occurrence for 44 species of amphibians and reptiles in Portugal were modelled using seven modelling techniques: Gower metric, Ecological Niche Factor Analysis, classification trees, neural networks, generalized linear models, generalized additive models and spatial interpolators. Generalized linear and additive models were constructed with and without a term accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Model performance was measured using two methods: sensitivity and Kappa index. Species were grouped according to their spatial (area of occupancy and extent of occurrence) and environmental (marginality and tolerance) distributions. Two‐way comparison tests were performed to detect significant interactions between models and species groups. Results Interaction between model and species groups was significant for both sensitivity and Kappa index. This indicates that model performance varied for species with different geographical and environmental distributions. Artificial neural networks performed generally better, immediately followed by generalized additive models including a covariate term for spatial autocorrelation. Non‐parametric methods were preferred to parametric approaches, especially when modelling distributions of species with a greater area of occupancy, a larger extent of occurrence, lower marginality and higher tolerance. Main conclusions This is a first attempt to relate performance of modelling techniques with species spatial and environmental distributions. Results indicate a strong relationship between model performance and the kinds of species distributions being modelled. Some methods performed generally better, but no method was superior in all circumstances. A suggestion is made that choice of the appropriate method should be contingent on the goals and kinds of distributions being modelled.",W1838542636,False,0.8474699258804321

The new analysis is based on the simplified forest carbon stock method of the FAOSTAT Emissions database, equivalent to a Tier 1, Approach 1 IPCC methodology, limited to biomass carbon stocks. Our results indicated that CO2 emissions from net forest conversion decreased significantly, from an average of 4.0 Gt CO2 yr−1 during 2001–2010 to 2.9 Gt CO2 yr−1 during 2011–2015. More than half of the estimated reductions over the last five years, some 0.6 Gt CO2 yr−1, took place in Brazil. Detailed analyses further indicated that remaining forests continued to function as a net carbon sink globally, with an average net removal of −2.2 Gt CO2 yr−1 during 2001–2010, and −2.1 Gt CO2 yr−1 during 2011–2015. Annex I Parties represented the bulk of this sink, contributing 60% of the total in 2011–2015, down from 65% in 2001–2010. Compared to previous FAOSTAT assessments for the period 2001–2010, based on the 2010 FRA and published in the IPCC AR5, the use of FRA 2015 data led to estimates of net forest conversion that were consistent with previous ones (4.0 vs. 3.8 Gt CO2 yr−1), while the estimated forest sinks were 22% larger (−2.2 vs. −1.8 Gt CO2 yr−1). The net contribution of forests to anthropogenic forcing based on FRA2015 data was thus smaller than previously estimated by the IPCC AR5. Finally, we separated for the first time net emissions and removals from forest land into a sink component and a degradation component. Results indicated that, contrary to CO2 emissions from deforestation, CO2 emissions from forest degradation increased significantly, from 0.4 Gt CO2 yr−1 in the 1990s, to 1.1 Gt CO2 yr−1 in 2001–2010 and 1.0 Gt CO2 yr−1 in 2011–2015.

https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-9-5125-2012,Carbon emissions from land use and land-cover change,"Abstract. The net flux of carbon from land use and land-cover change (LULCC) accounted for 12.5% of anthropogenic carbon emissions from 1990 to 2010. This net flux is the most uncertain term in the global carbon budget, not only because of uncertainties in rates of deforestation and forestation, but also because of uncertainties in the carbon density of the lands actually undergoing change. Furthermore, there are differences in approaches used to determine the flux that introduce variability into estimates in ways that are difficult to evaluate, and not all analyses consider the same types of management activities. Thirteen recent estimates of net carbon emissions from LULCC are summarized here. In addition to deforestation, all analyses considered changes in the area of agricultural lands (croplands and pastures). Some considered, also, forest management (wood harvest, shifting cultivation). None included emissions from the degradation of tropical peatlands. Means and standard deviations across the thirteen model estimates of annual emissions for the 1980s and 1990s, respectively, are 1.14 ± 0.23 and 1.12 ± 0.25 Pg C yr−1 (1 Pg = 1015 g carbon). Four studies also considered the period 2000–2009, and the mean and standard deviations across these four for the three decades are 1.14 ± 0.39, 1.17 ± 0.32, and 1.10 ± 0.11 Pg C yr−1. For the period 1990–2009 the mean global emissions from LULCC are 1.14 ± 0.18 Pg C yr−1. The standard deviations across model means shown here are smaller than previous estimates of uncertainty as they do not account for the errors that result from data uncertainty and from an incomplete understanding of all the processes affecting the net flux of carbon from LULCC. Although these errors have not been systematically evaluated, based on partial analyses available in the literature and expert opinion, they are estimated to be on the order of ± 0.5 Pg C yr−1.",W2117141344,False,0.35044941306114197

Using all three available AFOLU datasets employed for analysis in the IPCC AR5, rather than just one as done in the IPCC AR5 WGIII Summary for Policy Makers, our analyses point to a down-revision of global AFOLU shares of total anthropogenic emissions, while providing important additional information on subsectoral trends. Our findings confirm that the share of AFOLU emissions to the anthropogenic total declined over time. They indicate a decadal average of 28.7 ± 1.5% in the 1990s and 23.6 ± 2.1% in the 2000s and an annual value of 21.2 ± 1.5% in 2010. The IPCC AR5 had indicated a 24% share in 2010. In contrast to previous decades, when emissions from land use (land use, land use change and forestry, including deforestation) were significantly larger than those from agriculture (crop and livestock production), in 2010 agriculture was the larger component, contributing 11.2 ± 0.4% of total GHG emissions, compared to 10.0 ± 1.2% of the land use sector. Deforestation was responsible for only 8% of total anthropogenic emissions in 2010, compared to 12% in the 1990s. Since 2010, the last year assessed by the IPCC AR5, new FAO estimates indicate that land use emissions have remained stable, at about 4.8 Gt CO2 eq yr-1 in 2012. Emissions minus removals have also remained stable, at 3.2 Gt CO2 eq yr-1 in 2012. By contrast, agriculture emissions have continued to grow, at roughly 1% annually, and remained larger than the land use sector, reaching 5.4 Gt CO2 eq yr-1 in 2012.

Especially in the tropics where forests are declining at a rapid rate, national forest monitoring systems capable of reliably estimating forest cover, forest cover change and carbon stock change are of vital importance. As a large number of tropical countries had limited capacity in the past to implement such a system, capacity building efforts are now ongoing to strengthen the technical and political skillsets necessary to implement national forest monitoring at institutional levels. This paper assesses the current status and recent changes in national forest monitoring and reporting capacities in 99 tropical countries, using the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) 2015 data, complemented with FRA 2010 and FRA 2005 data. Three indicators ""Forest area change monitoring and remote sensing capacities"", ""Forest inventory capacities"" and ""Carbon pool reporting capacities"" were used to assess the countries' capacities for the years 2005, 2010 and 2015 and the change in capacities between 2005–2010 and 2010–2015. Forest area change monitoring and remote sensing capacities improved considerably between 2005 and 2015. The total tropical forest area that is monitored with good to very good forest area change monitoring and remote sensing capacities increased from 69% in 2005 to 83% in 2015. This corresponds to 1435 million ha in 2005 and 1699 million ha in 2015. This effect is related to more free and open remote sensing data and availability of techniques to improve forest area change monitoring. The total tropical forest area that is monitored with good to very good forest inventory capacities increased from 38% in 2005 to 66% in 2015. This corresponds to 785 million ha in 2005 and 1350 million ha in 2015. Carbon pool reporting capacities did not show as much improvement and the majority of countries still report at Tier 1 level. This indicates the need for greater emphasis on producing accurate emission factors at Tier 2 or Tier 3 level and improved greenhouse gases reporting. It is further shown that there was a positive adjustment in the net change in forest area where countries with lower capacities in the past had the tendency to overestimate the area of forest loss. The results emphasized the effectiveness of capacity building programmes (such as those by FAO and REDD+ readiness) but also the need for continued capacity development efforts. It is important for countries to maintain their forest monitoring system and update their inventories on a regular basis. This will further improve accuracy and reliability of data and information on forest resources and will provide countries with the necessary input to refine policies and decisions and to further improve forest management.",W1208424556,False,0.4015367925167084

When seeking adaptive explanations for body sizes, the size dependence of predation risk is of particular interest. Here, we review published studies that provide (1) estimates of the daily predation rates experienced by insect larvae feeding on tree leaves or (2) evidence concerning the relationship between predation risk and larval size. Larvae were found to experience an average avian predation rate of 3.1% per day and an average arthropod predation rate of 10.5% per day. In some studies, mortality rates were systematically dependent on parameters of the larvae (e.g. coloration) or of the environment (host plant, season), but not to the extent that would render generalizations meaningless. Nevertheless, mortality rates varied considerably more for arthropod than avian predators, making an estimate of avian predation rate more reliable for use in quantitative models. Moreover, birds tend to be a more important predator guild exploiting the larger larval stages, as indicated by the predominantly positive size dependence of avian predation risk. By contrast, predation by arthropods was generally negatively size dependent. Based on the available data, we estimate that avian predation rates increase approximately 3.6-fold, while arthropod predation rates decrease approximately 4.9-fold, in response to a 2-fold increase in the linear size of prey. A modelling exercise showed that realistic mortality rates – if assumed to be independent of size – cannot serve as a basis for adaptive explanations for observed body sizes. However, by assuming a positive size dependence of mortality risk within the limits observed for bird predation, it is possible to explain a wide range of body sizes within an optimality framework.",W1593848515,False,0.6168456077575684

A generalized linear model (GLM) is presented for the analysis of comparative data, which can be used to address questions regarding the relationship between traits or between traits and environments, the rate of phenotypic evolution, the degree of phylogenetic effect, and the ancestral state of a character. Our approach thus emphasizes the similarity among evolutionary questions asked in comparative studies. We then discuss ways of specifying the sources of error involved in a comparative study (e.g., measurement error, error due to evolution along a phylogeny, error due to misspecification of a phylogeny) and show how the impact of these sources of error can be taken into account in a comparative analysis. In contrast to most existing phylogenetic comparative methods, our procedure offers substantial flexibility in the choice of microevolutionary assumptions underlying the statistical analysis, allowing researchers to choose assumptions that are most appropriate for their particular set of data and evolutionary question. In developing the approach, we also propose novel ways of incorporating within-species variation and/or measurement error into phylogenetic analyses, of estimating ancestral states, and of considering both continuous (quantitative) and categorical (qualitative or ""state"") characters in the same analysis.",W1963617394,False,0.015879981219768524

Departing from the classical view of monophyly of all forms of self-incompatibility, the current paradigm for the origin of self-incompatibility postulates multiple episodes of recruitment and modification of preexisting genes. In Brassica, the S locus, which regulates sporophytic self-incompatibility, shows homology to a multigene family present both in self-compatible congeners and in groups for which this form of self-incompatibility is atypical. A phylogenetic analysis of S-allele sequences together with homologous sequences that do not cosegregate with self-incompatibility permits dating the change of function that marked the origin of self-incompatibility. A generalized least-squares method is introduced that provides closed-form expressions for estimates and standard errors for function-specific divergence rates and times of divergence among sequences. This analysis suggests that the age of the sporophytic self-incompatibility system expressed in Brassica exceeds species divergence within the genus by four- to fivefold. The extraordinarily high levels of sequence diversity exhibited by S alleles appears to reflect their ancient derivation, with the alternative hypothesis of hypermutability rejected by the analysis.",W1907366230,False,0.001291642664000392

In 1917 D'Arcy Thompson introduced an elegant model of homology as deformation: the configuration of landmark locations for any one form is viewed as a finite sample from a smooth mapping representing its biological relationship to any other form of the data set. For data in two dimensions, multivariate statistical analysis of landmark locations may proceed unambiguously in terms of complex-valued shape coordinates (e,v) = (C−A)/(B−A) for sets of landmark triangles ABC. These are the coordinates of one vertex/landmark after scaling so that the remaining two vertices are at (0,0) and (1,0). Expressed in this fashion, the biological interpretation of the statistical analysis as a homology mapping would appear to depend on the triangulation. This paper introduces an analysis of landmark data and homology mappings using a hierarchy of geometric components of shape difference or shape change. Each component is a smooth deformation taking the form of a bivariate polynomial in the shape coordinates and is estimated in a manner nearly invariant with respect to the choice of a triangulation.",W1976821878,False,0.002640201011672616

Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with degenerate primers based on the Drosophila Antennapedia-class homeodomain consensus sequence, eight differentially transcribed homeoboxes were identified from Haliotis larvae prior to and during metamorphosis. These are the first homeoboxes isolated from the phylum Molusca. Five of the partial homeobox sequences presented appear to represent Antennapedia-like genes of the putative Haliotis HOM-C/Hox complex; the remainder show similarity to homeoboxes of divergent classes.

During gangliogenesis, Lox4 was expressed within this series of neurons in three different temporal patterns: (1) it was never expressed in the RPE homologs of ganglia 1-3; (2) it was expressed in the RPEs during gangliogenesis, but was turned off when these neurons started to differentiate after gangliogenesis; and (3) it was expressed in the RPE homologs of segments 4-5 and 7-21 during gangliogenesis and the subsequent period of axonogenesis. We found that these neurons have three distinct peripheral axonal morphologies that correlate with the three temporal patterns of expression.

https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.122.5.1449,Analysis of <i>Hox</i> gene expression in the chick limb bud,"ABSTRACT The vertebrate Hox genes have been shown to be important for patterning the primary and secondary axes of the developing vertebrate embryo. The function of these genes along the primary axis of the embryo has been generally interpreted in the context of positional specification and homeotic transformation of axial structures. The way in which these genes are expressed and function during the development of the secondary axes, particularly the limb, is less clear. In order to provide a reference for understanding the role of the Hox genes in limb patterning, we isolated clones of 23 Hox genes expressed during limb development, characterized their expression patterns and analyzed their regulation by the signalling centers which pattern the limb. The expression patterns of the Abd-B-related Hoxa and Hoxd genes have previously been partially characterized; however, our study reveals that these genes are expressed in patterns more dynamic and complex than generally appreciated, only transiently approximating simple, concentric, nested domains. Detailed analysis of these patterns suggests that the expression of each of the Hoxa and Hoxd genes is regulated in up to three independent phases. Each of these phases appears to be associated with the specification and patterning of one of the proximodistal segments of the limb (upper arm, lower arm and hand). Interestingly, in the last of these phases, the expression of the Hoxd genes violates the general rule of spatial and temporal colinearity of Hox gene expression with gene order along the chromosome. In contrast to the Abd-B-related Hoxa and Hoxd genes, which are expressed in both the fore and hind limbs, different sets of Hoxc genes are expressed in the two limbs. There is a correlation between the relative position of these genes along the chromosome and the axial level of the limb bud in which they are expressed. The more 3′ genes are expressed in the fore limb bud while the 5′ genes are expressed in the hind limb bud; intermediate genes are transcribed in both limbs. However, there is no clear correlation between the relative position of the genes along the chromosome and their expression domains within the limb. With the exception of Hoxc-11, which is transcribed in a posterior portion of the hind limb, Hoxc gene expression is restricted to the anterior/proximal portion of the limb bud. Importantly, comparison of the distributions of Hoxc-6 RNA and protein products reveals posttranscriptional regulation of this gene, suggesting that caution must be exercised in interpreting the functional significance of the RNA distribution of any of the vertebrate Hox genes. To understand the genesis of the complex patterns of Hox gene expression in the limb bud, we examined the propagation of Hox gene expression relative to cell proliferation. We find that shifts in Hox gene expression cannot be attributed to passive expansion due to cell proliferation. Rather, phase-specific Hox gene expression patterns appear to result from a context-dependent response of the limb mesoderm to Sonic hedgehog. Sonic hedgehog (the patterning signal from the Zone of Polarizing Activity) is known to be able to activate Hoxd gene expression in the limb. Although we find that Sonic hedgehog is capable of initiating and polarizing Hoxd gene expression during both of the latter two phases of Hox gene expression, the specific patterns induced are not determined by the signal, but depend upon the temporal context of the mesoderm receiving the signal. Misexpression of Sonic hedgehog also reveals that Hoxb-9, which is normally excluded from the posterior mesenchyme of the leg, is negatively regulated by Sonic hedgehog and that Hoxc-11, which is expressed in the posterior portion of the leg, is not affected by Sonic hedgehog and hence is not required to pattern the skeletal elements of the lower leg.",W1868418021,False,0.04781334102153778

Signals from dorsal and ventral ectoderm control dorso-ventral patterning while the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) controls bud outgrowth and patterning along the proximo-distal axis. We show, using cell-fate tracers, the existence of two distinct ectodermal compartments, dorsal versus ventral, in both presumptive limb and flank of early chick embryos. This organisation of limb ectoderm is the first direct evidence, in vertebrates, of compartments in non-neural ectoderm. Since the apical ridge appears to be confined to this compartment boundary, this positions the limb. The mesoderm, unlike the ectoderm, does not contain two separate dorsal and ventral cell lineages, suggesting that dorsal and ventral ectoderm compartments may be important to ensure appropriate control of mesodermal cell fate. Surprisingly, we also show that cells which form the apical ridge are initially scattered in a wide region of early ectoderm and that both dorsal and ventral ectoderm cells contribute to the apical ridge, intermingling to some extent within it.",W1905883780,False,0.001311789732426405

Determining the best model is a two-stage process. First, we must identify the set of parameters that we will allow to vary in seeking to fit the observations. As part of this process we need also to fix the allowable (prior) ranges that these parameters might take, most generally by providing a probability density function in the N-dimensional parameter space. This combination of parameter set and prior distribution is what we will call a model, and it should make calculable predictions for the quantities we are going to measure. Having chosen the model, the second stage is to determine, from the observations, the ranges of values of the parameters which are compatible with the data. This second step, parameter estimation, is described in the cosmological context by Lewis and Bridle in Chapter 3 of this volume.

Using phylogenetically rigorous techniques, we investigated the association between morphological diversity and two design breakthroughs within the jaws of parrotfish. Similar intramandibular joints and other modifications of the pharyngeal jaws have evolved repeatedly in teleost fish and are frequently hypothesized to promote diversity. We quantified morphological diversity within six functionally important oral jaw traits using the Brownian motion rate of evolution to correct for phylogenetic and time-related biases and compared these rates across clades that did and did not possess the intramandibular joint and the parrotfish pharyngeal jaw. No change in morphological diversity was associated with the pharyngeal jaw modification alone but rates of oral jaw diversification were up to 8× faster in parrotfish species that possessed both innovations. Interestingly, this morphological diversity may not have led to differential resource uses as available data suggest that members of this clade show remarkable homogeneity of diet.",W1905105301,False,0.5412933230400085

https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6785-6-9,Measuring specialization in species interaction networks.,"Network analyses of plant-animal interactions hold valuable biological information. They are often used to quantify the degree of specialization between partners, but usually based on qualitative indices such as 'connectance' or number of links. These measures ignore interaction frequencies or sampling intensity, and strongly depend on network size. Here we introduce two quantitative indices using interaction frequencies to describe the degree of specialization, based on information theory. The first measure (d') describes the degree of interaction specialization at the species level, while the second measure (H2') characterizes the degree of specialization or partitioning among two parties in the entire network. Both indices are mathematically related and derived from Shannon entropy. The species-level index d' can be used to analyze variation within networks, while H2' as a network-level index is useful for comparisons across different interaction webs. Analyses of two published pollinator networks identified differences and features that have not been detected with previous approaches. For instance, plants and pollinators within a network differed in their average degree of specialization (weighted mean d'), and the correlation between specialization of pollinators and their relative abundance also differed between the webs. Rarefied sampling effort in both networks and null model simulations suggest that H2' is not affected by network size or sampling intensity. Quantitative analyses reflect properties of interaction networks more appropriately than previous qualitative attempts, and are robust against variation in sampling intensity, network size and symmetry. These measures will improve our understanding of patterns of specialization within and across networks from a broad spectrum of biological interactions.",W1486057548,False,0.7869504690170288

,Internal bioerosion of in situ living and dead corals on the Great Barrier Reef,"This thesis reports on a series of sampling and experimental studies aimed at quantifying the extent of internal bioerosion by four major groups of boring organisms in in situ coral substrates. Additional objectives of the study were to investigate the patterns of variability of internal bioerosion and overall skeletal degradation across common coral substrates and a number of spatial scales within a single habitat. The response of internal bioeroders to availability of dead coral substrate, such as following an Acanthaster planci outbreak, was also addressed. Internal bioerosion and external degradation were studied in living and dead corals of three species of Acropora (A.hyacinthus, A.gemmifera and A.cuneata) using a manipulative field experiment over a 21 month period. Coral colonies were killed in situ to simulate local episode of coral predation. In addition, living colonies of the same species were sampled and inte[rn]al bioerosion was quantified. The extent of internal bioerosion in living colonies was generally small, but differed strongly among the three coral species. A.cuneata was excavated up to ten times more than the other two species. The major source of difference among the species was the presence of the live-coral boring bivalve, Lithophaga lessepsiana, in colonies of A.cuneata. The majority of the remaining variation across the three species was explained, to different extent for each boring group, by inter-specific differences in the amount of exposed skeleton. This was found to be species-specific and, in the case of A.hyacinthus, to differ also between the two locations. Variation in the extent of excavation was high at small spatial scales for all coral species and all boring taxa. Sponges (Cliothosa hancocki in particular) were by far the most destructive borers in living colonies of the three species, together with the bivalve L.lessepsiana, which bored exclusively in living portions of A.cuneata. Worms, mostly polychaetes, although numerically more abundant, accounted for little of the total bioerosion in living corals. Colonies of the three species of Acropora were killed and left in situ for 21 months. Changes in colony size and rugosity over the period of exposure were examined using photographic monitoring. Both colony size and rugosity decreased significantly over time following death. The decrease in both size and rugosity varied considerably among the three coral species with very rapid skeletal degradation occurring soon after death in plate colonies of A.hyacinthus. The rates of external degradation in A.hyacinthus were not costant through time and were higher soon after death. In contrast, A.cuneata experienced no significant variation in size, while A.gemmifera decreased in size at a relatively uniform rate. In A.hyacinthus, the position of the colonies with regard to location, resulted in different rates of external degradation but this pattern decreased with time. At the study sites, external erosion of colonies of A.hyacinthus killed and left standing on the reef surface contributed a total of 0.41 to 1.19 kg of CaCO₃ per m² per year (when assuming a 100% cover of A.hyacinthus). Following the 21 month period of exposure to borers, the colonies were collected and analysed for the extent and nature of internal bioerosion. This differed greatly among the three coral species. The difference in the extent of bioerosion by worms was entirely explained by the extent of colony surface area available for settlement in the three coral species. On the contrary, availability of surface area did not explain the considerable difference in the extent of bioerosion by sponges in the three species. It is suggested that newly available substrates on the reef surface are readily excavated by boring sponges which are already present in adjacent substrates. Furthermore, it appears that the occurrence of large bivalve borings in colonies of A.cuneata might have determined a larger extent of excavation by sponges in this species. Bioerosion by bivalves was larger at South East exposed sites but no effect of location was detected for any other individual groups of borers. A.cuneata had a greater extent of total bioerosion by all taxa at the front sites, which is explained by the cumulative effect of sponges and bivalves. As was the case in the living colonies, the majority of the variability encountered was due to variation at small spatial scales (within-site variation for all groups and within colony variation for worms and bivalves in A.hyacinthus and A.gemrnifera). However, a small proportion of variability was explained at the spatial scale of site (hundreds of meters) for both worms and sponges. Total bioerosion was not correlated to any of the colony parameters considered. However, when bioerosion was considered for each group separately, there was a high correlation between colony surface area and bioerosion by worms, while bioerosion by sponges and bivalves correlated with colony volume. The comparison between bioerosion in living and dead coral colonies of the same species over a period of 21 months following death showed that the volume removed by internal bioeroders from dead colonies per unit of colony surface area, was significantly higher than the volume of skeleton excavated from living colonies. The average amount of CaCO₃ reworked by internal bioeroders per m² per year varied from a minimum of 0.23 g x m⁻² x y⁻¹ for barnacles to a maximum of 766.1 g x m⁻² x y⁻¹ for sponges. The reworking by borers of CaCO₃ in dead coral colonies varied up to 4-5 times among the coral species. This suggests that coral community composition and the dynamics of mortality of individual species may affect the overall reef bioerosion. Rates of excavation also varied between locations, with the SE more exposed sites experiencing higher rates of CaCO₃ loss via excavation by sponges and bivalves. In all coral species considered, sponges were the group that excavated the most of the CaCO₃ per unit of surface area and time. In order to investigate the effect of massive coral mortality on rates of internal bioerosion, a sampling study was conducted at two reefs which had been severely affected by Acanthaster planci, and at two reefs which had not experienced outbreaks in the last 20 years. Internal bioerosion was quantified for all reefs from dead Porites substrates. These were dated for the year of death of the living tissue using fluorescent bands occurring in the skeleton of these corals. The time elapsed since death was assumed to be the time of exposure to boring organisms. Bioerosion rates in Porites were not linear over time, but decreased with time after death of the substrate. Rates of bioerosion among reefs were not different although there were differences among sites within reefs. The major borers were worms, mostly sipunculans at all reefs, although sponges were locally abundant (i.e. Green Island). Sponges, when present, tended to be far more destructive than the other groups. No effect of outbreaks of Acanthaster planci was detected. The volume excavated per unit of time did not appear to either increase nor decrease as a result of severe episodes of coral mass mortality. This suggests that following an outbreak the production of carbonate by-products via excavation of dead corals may increase proportionally to the increase in dead coral cover. The majority of variation in rates of bioerosion was due to the duration of exposure of the substrate to borers. Bioerosion rates were highly variable at small spatial scales also (centimeters to meters), suggesting that processes occurring at small spatial scales, such as recruitment of borers, are most important in determining spatial patterns of internal bioerosion in Porites substrates. The instantaneous rates of bioerosion in dead Porites ranged between 8±4 to 626±170 g CaCO₃ m⁻² y⁻¹.",W1429483993,False,0.6687588095664978

To define the mechanisms underlying this habitat—specific pattern in abundance, we concurrently examined four components of recruitment to intertidal shell and mud habitats at two locations within the Grays Harbor estuary (Washington, USA): (1) water column supply of crab megalopae (postlarvae); (2) settlement patterns of crab megalopae 8 h after settlement substrates were deployed; (3) density of first benthic juvenile instars (J1) 48 h after deployment of such substrates; and (4) density of early juvenile crab in shell and mud habitats over a 4—mo period. We also describe the physical processes likely to be influencing postlarval supply within Grays Harbor, and take advantage of natural variation in postlarval supply between two locations, in combination with a predator exclusion experiment, to define the relative importance of postlarval supply vs. post—settlement survival in regulating population size of juvenile crab in certain intertidal habitats. Water column postlarval supply (measured with plankton and neuston nets, and artificial settlement substrates) in terms of both megalopal density (number per cubic metre) and flux (number per hour) was significantly higher in the southern part of the estuary vs. the northern part during a week—long settlement pulse. Our field observations and measurements suggest that spatial variation in postlarval supply was due to local differneces in wind—driven surface currents, since tidal current speeds in the two locations were similar. More—over, there was no correlation between current speed and flux of megalopae over the bottom. There was generally no difference in postlarval supply between shell and mud habitats. Our experimental results further indicate that: (1) the abundance of recently settled crab megalopae in 0.25 m 2 settlement trays was significantly higher in shell than in mud habitats, irrespective of whether the trays were placed in 3—5 ha of shell vs. mud; (2) there was a positive and significant correlation between postlarval supply and density of megalopae in shell and mud habitats; and (3) there was a positive and significant correlation between postlarval supply and density of J1 instars only in habitats where specific predators were excluded. Once the number of J1 instars at both geographical locations was reduced to similar levels, equivalent but steadily decreasing densities persisted throughout the summer growing season. The decoupling of settlement patterns and density of J1 instars took place within our 48—h sampling interval. Thus, future attempts to examine the correspondence between larval supply and post—settlement abundance of marine benthic species with planktonic larvae should do so at extremely small temporal scales or a critical life history phase may be overlooked. The results from this study demonstrate that substrate selection can affect distribution of juvenile crab, and that predation (including cannibalism) is a key factor regulating local population size of early juvenile crabs in intertidal habitats where postlarval supply is relatively high.",W1966636047,False,0.8441104888916016

The risk of plant extinctions can be assessed by considering the probability of dispersal or pollinator failure, reproductive dependence on the mutualism and demographic dependence on seeds. Traits for ranking species rapidly according to these three criteria are indicated. Analysis of case studies suggests that plants often compensate for high risk in one of the three categories by low risk in another. For example, selfincompatible plants with rare specialist pollinators often propagate vegetatively.

Included are hundreds of updated citations to work published since the appearance of the first edition and a new set of plates of fossil bees. The book begins with extensive introductory sections that include bee evolution, classification of the various bee families, the coevolution of bees and flowering plants, nesting behavior, differences between solitary and social bees, and the anatomy of these amazing insects. Drawing on modern studies and evidence from the fossil record, Michener reveals what the ancestral bee-the protobee-might have looked like. He also cites the major literature on bee biology and describes the need for further research on the systematics and natural history of bees, including their importance as pollinators of crops and natural vegetation. The greater part of the work consists of an unprecedented treatment of bee systematics, with keys for identification to the subgenus level. For each genus and subgenus, Michener includes a brief natural history describing geographical range, number of species, and noteworthy information pertaining to nesting or floral biology. The book is beautifully illustrated with more than 500 drawings and photographs that depict behavior, detailed morphology, and ecology.

They are: (1) the identification of taxa whose diversity is correlated with that of others: (2) the identification of times and methods of sampling that produce estimates of diversity representative of more intensive sampling; and (3) the use of morphospecies inventories generated by non‐specialists. Ants, beetles, and spiders were sampled from four forest types, in three seasons, using two collecting methods: pitfall trapping and extraction from litter. Specimens were sorted by a non‐specialist to morphospecies and by specialist taxonomists to species. Richness (α‐diversity) and turnover (β‐diversity) were compared for different sampling regimes using morphospecies and species inventories. We found no significant positive correlations between ant, beetle, and spider species richness but there was a strong negative correlation between ant and beetle richness. For beetles alone, richness within the families Carabidae, Scarabaeidae, and Pselaphidae (i.e, avoiding taxonomically problematic families) was significantly correlated with richness within all other families. Assessment of turnover revealed that: (1) the four forest types contained significantly different assemblages of ants and beetles but not spiders and 92) the four forests were less clearly discriminated using species from the three beetle families Carabidae, Scarabaeidae, and Pselaphidae when compared to species from all beetle families pooled. Analyses of single sampling periods and methods revealed that summer and spring pitfall samples were most representative of more intensive sampling. That is: (1) the richness of ants and beetles in these samples was significantly positively correlated with the richness of all other samples and 92) turnover of beetles and ants among the four forests revealed by summer pitfall samples was similar to turnover using all samples. The three beetle surrogate families recorded by pitfall samples in spring, and to a lesser extent summer, showed significant correlations in richness with all other beetle species recorded in the same samples. However, the assessment of turnover was less accurate when only surrogate families were used. The most accurate and cost‐effective assessment of turnover was generated by a summer pitfall sample in which data for ants, carabid, and scarab beetles were combined and analyzed as a single data set. Results were largely consistent regardless of whether species or morphospecies were used, which suggests that monitoring and assessment of terrestrial invertebrate biodiversity may be achieved by the careful use of morphospecies. Our results also suggest those invertebrate taxa, sampling methods, and sampling periods that yield the most consistent and reliable assessment of epigaeic invertebrate biodiversity in Australian temperate hardwood forests. However, empirical studies that follow the protocols discussed in this paper are urgently required in different environments.

Although secondary metabolites are recognized as fundamental to the defence of plants against insect and mammalian herbivores, their relative importance compared to other potential defensive plant traits (e.g. physical resistance, gross morphology, life‐history, primary chemistry and physiology) are not well understood. 2. We conducted a meta‐analysis to answer the question: What types of genetically variable plant traits most strongly predict resistance against herbivores? We performed a comprehensive literature search and obtained 499 separate measurements of the strength of covariation (measured as genetic correlations) between plant traits and herbivore susceptibility – these were extracted from 72 studies involving 19 plant families. 3. Surprisingly, we found no overall association between the concentrations of secondary metabolites and herbivore susceptibility – plant traits other than secondary metabolites most strongly predicted herbivore susceptibility. Specifically, genetic variation in life‐history traits (e.g. flowering time, growth rate) consistently exhibited the strongest genetic correlations with susceptibility. Genetic variation in gross morphological traits (e.g. no. branches, plant size) and physical resistance traits (e.g. latex, trichomes) were also frequently correlated with variation in herbivore susceptibility, but these relationships depended on attributes of the herbivores (e.g. feeding guild) and plants (e.g. longevity). 4. These results call into question the conventional wisdom that secondary metabolites are the most important anti‐herbivore defence of plants. We propose the hypothesis that herbivores select most strongly on genetic variation in life‐history, morphological and physical resistance traits, but the greater pleiotropic effects of genes controlling these traits impose strong constraints on their evolution. Meanwhile, secondary metabolites could have evolved to be important defensive mechanisms not because they have the largest effect on herbivores, but because the constraints on their evolution are the weakest.",W1518546884,False,0.6799191236495972

This review focuses on bark defenses, a front line against organisms trying to reach the nutrient‐rich phloem. A major breach of the bark can lead to tree death, as evidenced by the millions of trees killed every year by specialized bark‐invading insects. Different defense strategies have arisen in conifer lineages, but the general strategy is one of overlapping constitutive mechanical and chemical defenses overlaid with the capacity to up‐regulate additional defenses. The defense strategy incorporates a graded response from ‘repel’, through ‘defend’ and ‘kill’, to ‘compartmentalize’, depending upon the advance of the invading organism. Using a combination of toxic and polymer chemistry, anatomical structures and their placement, and inducible defenses, conifers have evolved bark defense mechanisms that work against a variety of pests. However, these can be overcome by strategies including aggregation pheromones of bark beetles and introduction of virulent phytopathogens. The defense structures and chemicals in conifer bark are reviewed and questions about their coevolution with bark beetles are discussed. Contents Summary 353 I. Introduction 354 II.

,Forest Insects: Principles and Practice of Population Management,"This book is intended as a general text for undergraduates studying the manage ment of forest insect pests. It is divided into four parts: insects, ecology, manage ment, and practice. Part I, Insects, contains two chapters. The first is intended to provide an overview of the general attributes of insects. Recognizing that it is impossible to adequately treat such a diverse and complex group of organisms in such a short space, I have attempted to highlight those insectan characteristics that make them difficult animals to combat. I have also tried to expose the insects' weak points, those attributes that make them vulnerable to manipulation by human actions. Even so, this first chapter will seem inadequate and sketchy to many of my colleagues. Ideally, this book should be used in conjunction with a laboratory manual covering insect anatomy, physiology, biology, behavior, and classifica tion in much greater depth-in fact, this is how I organize my forest entomology course. It is hoped that this first chapter will provide nonentomologists with a general feel for the insects and with a broad understanding of their strengths and weaknesses, while Chapter 2 will provide a brief overview of the diverse insect fauna that attacks the various parts of forest trees and their products.",W1484576526,False,0.5631719827651978

This method can prove to be more informative than common ""vote counting,"" in which the number of significant results is compared to the number with nonsignificant results to determine whether the phenomenon of interest is globally important. While the use of meta-analysis is widespread in medicine and the social sciences, only recently has it been applied to ecological questions. We compared the results of parametric confidence limits and homogeneity statistics commonly obtained through meta-analysis to those obtained from resampling methods to ascertain the robustness of standard meta-analytic techniques. We found that confidence limits based on bootstrapping methods were wider than standard confidence limits, implying that resampling estimates are more conservative. In addition, we found that significance tests based on homogeneity statistics differed occasionally from results of randomization tests, implying that inferences based solely on chi-square significance tests may lead to erroneous conclusions. We conclude that resampling methods should be incorporated in meta-analysis studies, to ensure proper evaluation of main effects in ecological studies.",W1967857296,False,0.888680636882782

https://doi.org/10.2307/2937184,Size and Timing of Metamorphosis in Complex Life Cycles: Time Constraints and Variation,"Complex life cycles are characterized by niche shifts at the time of metamorphosis. Current models predict optimal sizes for metamorphosis based on maximizing growth, minimizing mortality, or some balance of these goals. These models predict optimal sizes that are independent of the time of metamorphosis. Reproduction and other major events in the life history of organisms are often constrained to seasons, and the state (e.g., mass) of the organism at that time is related to fitness. Therefore, an organism's state as well as the time that that state is achieved are central variables in these time—constrained life histories. We extend earlier theory to include explicit time constraints in three, hypothetical, complex life cycles. Dynamic optimization models are constructed to determine optimal time and mass trajectories for niche shifts. First, we consider the habitat shift at emergence in mayflies, where reproduction terminates a growth period in the first habitat and is constrained to a season. Second, we consider the habitat shift at metamorphosis in amphibians, where reproduction terminates a growth phase in the second habitat and reproduction is constrained to a single point in time. Third, we combine the first two effects to allow an extended period of reproduction in amphibians. Here optimal time and mass trajectories are determined for two niche shifts–the shift from aquatic to terrestrial habitat and the shift from a growth phase to a reproductive phase. We present analytical theory that allows both quantitative and qualitative predictions. Problem constructions and solutions are presented graphically to aid intuition in interpreting our results and extending the framework to other parameter values and other life—history examples. The general conclusion is that time constraints on complex life histories lead to optimal sizes for niche shifts that vary with time. In time—constrained life histories, any variation in the state of individuals at some time prior to reproduction will be preserved to some degree at reproduction. Therefore, in time—constrained life histories, we expect optimal switches in habitat use or life history stage to depend not only on state but also on the time that state is achieved.",W1967987171,False,0.7917430400848389

One proximate mechanism is a latitudinal bias in the discrepancy between speciation and extinction rates, leading to higher rates of species diversification toward lower latitudes. Despite being central to many explanations for high tropical diversity, this mechanism is tested very rarely. We discuss some of the problems involved in testing for latitudinal bias in diversification rates and present an example phylogenetic analysis for endemic bird genera of the New World. The results provide evidence for higher diversification rates in clades inhabiting lower latitudes, both when genera are considered independent and when phylogeny is controlled for using independent contrasts. High rates of diversification are also associated with larger geographic area and higher net primary productivity, although these do not fully account for the latitudinal effect. The latitudinal pattern is stronger in younger clades, supporting the prediction of a simple model in which the signal of latitudinal bias in diversification rates diminishes as clades age and become saturated with species. Our study demonstrates that a clade-based approach can help answer important questions that a geographic approach cannot, but large phylogenies and geographic databases are needed to cope with the large amount of noise inherent in this type of analysis.",W1965432007,False,0.27238088846206665

,"Macroevolution, pattern and process","In this text, the author addresses, from a palaeobiologist's perspective, the question of whether punctuated equilibria - the view, popularized by Stephen Jay Gould among others, that species remain evolutionarily static for long periods of time, with substantial genetic changes and the development of new adaptive strategies occurring only during speciation, or gradualism - the view that large-scale changes result from continual and successive small-scale changes, offers the best account of the history of life. Coming down on the side of those who favour the model of punctuated equilibria, Stanley argues that only quantum speciation (rapid and radically divergent), can explain the story of life revealed in the fossil record; macroevolution, he contends, cannot be attributed to microevolutionary forces such as mutation, genetic drift and natural selection. Instead, he posits a series of processes, including species selection, phyletic drift and directed speciation, to accounnt for large-scale patterns.",W1504049102,False,0.04379719868302345

https://doi.org/10.1086/282885,On the Theory of Optimal Diets,"Using techniques of stochastic theory, I develop a new aproach to predicting optimal diets. The models developed are for a mobile predator feeding on stationary prey; however, the models can easily be extended to include mobile prey. Parameters used in the models are caloric content, time to pursue and density of each prey type, and the speed of the predator. Both clumped and random prey distribution are considered. The models predict the optimal diet of a predator faced with a variety of potential prey types. The optimal diet is predicted as the set of successive prey choices which maximizes the rate of caloric intake or, alternatively, minimizes the time required to find a food ration. Also predicted are the criteria for specialization and switching from a specialist diet to a generalist diet. The criteria for specialization and for switching are independent of the density of the alternate prey type. Also, a predator feeding so as to maximize the rate of caloric intake should take a prey on every encounter with it or not take it at all. Thus, the model predicts that an animal feeding according to the dictates of the optimal diet should show no partial preferences. The role of predator satiation in affecting prey selection is discussed in light of the above findings. Criteria for optimal diet with clumped prey distributions are identical to the criteria in the case of random prey distributions except that the increased diameter of a prey clump leads to greater predator specialization. This arises because the prey become more conspicuous, thus reducing the time to search for prey. The relevance of this finding to pollinator specificity is discussed.",W1978531277,False,0.7025753855705261

Starved rodents husked four kinds of large seeds (spinach, sunflower, squash and pumpkin) and were timed at the task. Geometric mean husking times varied from 3.1 to 70.1 seconds, depending on the seed and the rodent. Husking time was inversely proportional to an animal's body size. However, despite their slowness, smaller animals appear to be more efficient at dealing with these large seeds because they have a smaller metabolic drain. This conclusion is based on the assumption that gross caloric need increases linearly with (body weight). 7 5. The authors defend the assumption and thus believe that smaller animals have a competitive advantage while husking seeds. These rodents might engage in a limited amount of habitat and resource selection based on their relative seed—husking abilities. However, the order in which the various species should prefer these seeds is quite similar, so resource allocation based on husking speed differences would seem of little potential importance in maintaining competing heteromyids in a state of coexistence. Previous investigators have shown that seed selection occurs in some cases, but many cases are also known in which little or no selection is practiced.",W2016668245,False,0.8986467123031616

Here we examine Rohde's (1978, 1992) hypothesis, which proposes that climatic conditions at low latitudes lead to elevated rates of speciation. This hypothesis predicts that rates of molecular evolution should increase towards lower latitudes, but this prediction has never been tested. We discuss potential links between rates of molecular evolution and latitudinal diversity gradients, and present the first test of latitudinal variation in rates of molecular evolution. Using 45 phylogenetically independent, latitudinally separated pairs of bird species and higher taxa, we compare rates of evolution of two mitochondrial genes and DNA–DNA hybridization distances. We find no support for an effect of latitude on rate of molecular evolution. This result casts doubt on the generality of a key component of Rohde's hypothesis linking climate and speciation.",W1680461446,False,0.4995460510253906

https://doi.org/10.2307/1943071,The Seasonal Dynamics of The Chesapeake Bay Ecosystem,"The full suite of carbon exchanges among the 36 most important components of the Chesapeake Bay mesohaline ecosystem is estimated to examine the seasonal trends in energy flow and the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. The networks provide information on the rates of energy transfer between the trophic components in a system wherein autochthonous production is dominated by phytoplankton production. A key seasonal feature of the system is that the summer grazing of primary producers by zooplankton is greatly reduced due to top—down control of zooplankton by ctenophores and sea nettles. Some of the ungrazed phytoplankton is left to fuel the activities of the pelagic microbial community, and the remainder falls to the bottom where it augments the deposit—feeding assemblage of polychaetes, amphipods, and blue crabs. There is a dominant seasonal cycle in the activities of all subcommunities, which is greatest in the summer and least in the cold season. However, the overall topology of the ecosystem does not appear to change substantially from season to season. Matrix operations can be employed to assess the various direct and indirect pathways by which each trophic group obtains energy. Often, indirect linkages reveal interesting differences. For example, although the bluefish and striped bass are both piscivorous predators, 63% of bluefish intake depends indirectly on benthic organisms, whereas striped bass depends mainly on planktonic organisms. Nearly all higher trophic species exhibit significant indirect dependencies upon the upper components of the microbial loop, especially during summer. The complicated trophic network can be mapped into an eight—level trophic chain in the sense of Lindeman. Such analysis reveals that detritivory is about 10 times greater than herbivorous grazing in the Chesapeake system and that 70% of detritus results from internal recycle. Annual efficiencies of trophic levels decrease as one ascends the chain. Major seasonal shifts in trophic efficiencies at higher levels appear to be modulated by how effectively microscopic zooplankton (mostly ciliates) are cropped by their predators. Average trophic efficiency is 9.6%. Despite the existence of eight trophic levels, the average level at which each species feeds always remains below 5. One ""pest"" species (the coelenterate Chrysaora quinquecirrha) feeds rather high on the trophic pyramid and may exert a heretofore unappreciated level of control on the planktonic food chain. The number of cycles present in the network is surprisingly few, despite the fact that a relatively large and seemingly constant amount (23.2%) of total system activity is devoted to recycling. This combination of factors possibly indicates a stressed ecosystem. A study of the rate—limiting links in the seasonal networks of recycling of material within the plankton reconfirms the shift of predator control from crustaceous zooplankton in springtime to the sea nettle (Chrysaora quinquecirrha) during summer months. The collection of cycles present in the system is disjoint; there is no overlap between the cycles among the planktonic community and the circulations among the deposit feeders and nekton. The filter—feeding benthos and fish do not participate in any cycling, but serve rather as bridges to shift carbon and energy from the planktonic community into the benthic—nektonic subsystems. Neither do most of the members of the microbial loop engage in any recycle of carbon, functioning instead as a dissipative shunt of energy out of the system.",W1972501876,False,0.8868677616119385

These factors were determined for two bacteria, five fungi, and a yeast isolated from soil. Moisture stress conditions occurring in nature were simulated by growth in two media using shake cultures, on agar plates, and on membranes held at 34, 330, and 1,390 kPa of suction. The observed conversion factors, i.e., the ratio between dry weight and wet volume, generally increased with increasing moisture stress. The ratios for fungi ranged from 0.11 to 0.41 g/cm 3 with an average of 0.33 g/cm 3. Correction of earlier data assuming 80% water and a wet-weight specific gravity of 1.1 would require a conversion factor of 1.44. The dry-weight specific gravity of bacteria and yeasts ranged from 0.38 to 1.4 g/cm 3 with an average of 0.8 g/cm 3. These high values can only occur at 10% ash if no more than 50% of the cell is water, and a specific conversion factor to correct past data for bacterial biomass has not yet been suggested. The high conversion factors for bacteria and yeast could not be explained by shrinkage of cells due to heat fixing, but shrinkage during preparation could not be completely discounted. Moisture stress affected the C, N, and P content of the various organisms, with the ash contents increasing with increasing moisture stress. Although further work is necessary to obtain accurate conversion factors between biovolume and biomass, especially for bacteria, this study clearly indicates that existing data on the specific gravity and the water and nutrient content of microorganisms grown in shake cultures cannot be applied when quantifying the soil microbial biomass.",W1511937497,False,0.7883502244949341

This procedure is compared with two others reported earlier, and their relative merits are discussed as concerns the choice of procedure for the cellular information desired from the soil. Freeze-etching showed that the cell types and size distributions for cells which have been released and concentrated from soil are in general agreement with those for cells in a crude soil slurry in which no attempt to release and concentrate cells was made. Microcolonies were present both in the crude slurry and in the discard soil debris centrifugation pellets from the cell release and concentration procedures.

Previous hypotheses have suggested that close island relatives of mainland Norops species (the Cuban Anolis sagrei and Jamaican A. grahami series) represent over‐water dispersal from a mainland ancestor. These previous hypotheses predict that the A. sagrei and A. grahami series should be phylogenetically nested within a Norops clade whose ancestral geography traces to the mainland. If Norops is West Indian in origin, then West Indian species should span the deepest phylogenetic divergences within the Norops clade. Location Central and South America and West Indian islands. Methods The phylogenetic relationships of Anolis lizards are reconstructed from aligned DNA sequences using both parsimony and Bayesian approaches. Hypotheses are tested in two ways: (1) by reconstructing the ancestral geographic location for the Norops clade using Pagel &amp; Lutzoni's (2002) Bayesian approach, and (2) by testing alternative topological arrangements via Wilcoxon Signed‐Ranks tests ( Templeton, 1983 ) and Shimodaira–Hasegawa tests ( Shimodaira &amp; Hasegawa, 1999 ). Results Our evidence supports an origin of mainland Norops anoles from a West Indian ancestor. A West Indian ancestor to the Norops clade is statistically supported, and alternatives to the biogeographic pattern [Cuban (Jamaican, Mainland)] are statistically rejected by Shimodaira–Hasegawa tests, although not by Wilcoxon Signed‐Ranks tests. Main conclusions Our data support the hypothesis of a West Indian origin for mainland Norops. This result contradicts previous hypotheses and suggests that island forms may be an important source for mainland biodiversity.",W1946759719,False,0.7927585244178772
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00285.x,TESTING FOR PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL IN COMPARATIVE DATA: BEHAVIORAL TRAITS ARE MORE LABILE,"Abstract The primary rationale for the use of phylogenetically based statistical methods is that phylogenetic signal, the tendency for related species to resemble each other, is ubiquitous. Whether this assertion is true for a given trait in a given lineage is an empirical question, but general tools for detecting and quantifying phylogenetic signal are inadequately developed. We present new methods for continuous-valued characters that can be implemented with either phylogenetically independent contrasts or generalized least-squares models. First, a simple randomization procedure allows one to test the null hypothesis of no pattern of similarity among relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type I error rate at a nominal α= 0.05 and good power (0.8) for simulated datasets with 20 or more species. Second, we derive a descriptive statistic, K, which allows valid comparisons of the amount of phylogenetic signal across traits and trees. Third, we provide two biologically motivated branch-length transformations, one based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model of stabilizing selection, the other based on a new model in which character evolution can accelerate or decelerate (ACDC) in rate (e.g., as may occur during or after an adaptive radiation). Maximum likelihood estimation of the OU (d) and ACDC (g) parameters can serve as tests for phylogenetic signal because an estimate of d or g near zero implies that a phylogeny with little hierarchical structure (a star) offers a good fit to the data. Transformations that improve the fit of a tree to comparative data will increase power to detect phylogenetic signal and may also be preferable for further comparative analyses, such as of correlated character evolution. Application of the methods to data from the literature revealed that, for trees with 20 or more species, 92% of traits exhibited significant phylogenetic signal (randomization test), including behavioral and ecological ones that are thought to be relatively evolutionarily malleable (e.g., highly adaptive) and/or subject to relatively strong environmental (nongenetic) effects or high levels of measurement error. Irrespective of sample size, most traits (but not body size, on average) showed less signal than expected given the topology, branch lengths, and a Brownian motion model of evolution (i.e., K was less than one), which may be attributed to adaptation and/or measurement error in the broad sense (including errors in estimates of phenotypes, branch lengths, and topology). Analysis of variance of log K for all 121 traits (from 35 trees) indicated that behavioral traits exhibit lower signal than body size, morphological, life-history, or physiological traits. In addition, physiological traits (corrected for body size) showed less signal than did body size itself. For trees with 20 or more species, the estimated OU (25% of traits) and/or ACDC (40%) transformation parameter differed significantly from both zero and unity, indicating that a hierarchical tree with less (or occasionally more) structure than the original better fit the data and so could be preferred for comparative analyses.",W1990221500,False,0.29944726824760437
https://doi.org/10.1086/303327,Using the Past to Predict the Present: Confidence Intervals for Regression Equations in Phylogenetic Comparative Methods,"Two phylogenetic comparative methods, independent contrasts and generalized least squares models, can be used to determine the statistical relationship between two or more traits. We show that the two approaches are functionally identical and that either can be used to make statistical inferences about values at internal nodes of a phylogenetic tree (hypothetical ancestors), to estimate relationships between characters, and to predict values for unmeasured species. Regression equations derived from independent contrasts can be placed back onto the original data space, including computation of both confidence intervals and prediction intervals for new observations. Predictions for unmeasured species (including extinct forms) can be made increasingly accurate and precise as the specificity of their placement on a phylogenetic tree increases, which can greatly increase statistical power to detect, for example, deviation of a single species from an allometric prediction. We reexamine published data for basal metabolic rates (BMR) of birds and show that conventional and phylogenetic allometric equations differ significantly. In new results, we show that, as compared with nonpasserines, passerines exhibit a lower rate of evolution in both body mass and mass-corrected BMR; passerines also have significantly smaller body masses than their sister clade. These differences may justify separate, clade-specific allometric equations for prediction of avian basal metabolic rates.",W1996458817,False,0.5857350826263428

Although many MSA algorithms have been developed, there is still room for improvement in accuracy and speed. In the alignment of a family of protein sequences, global MSA algorithms perform better than local ones in many cases, while local ones perform better than global ones when some sequences have long insertions or deletions (indels) relative to others. Many recent leading MSA algorithms have incorporated pairwise alignment information obtained from a mixture of sources into their scoring system to improve accuracy of alignment containing long indels.

Since health resources are limited, decisions have to be made as to whether their use for an elimination or eradication programme is preferable to their use elsewhere. The costs and benefits of global eradication programmes concern direct effects on morbidity and mortality and consequent effects on the health care system. The success of any disease eradication initiative depends strongly on the level of societal and political commitment, with a key role for the World Health Assembly.

The joint posterior distribution of the substructure and allele frequencies of the respective populations is available in an analytical form when the number of populations is small, whereas an approximation based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation approach can be obtained for a moderate or large number of populations. Using the joint posterior distribution, posteriors can also be derived for any evolutionary population parameters, such as the traditional fixation indices. A major advantage compared to most earlier methods is that the number of populations is treated here as an unknown parameter. What is traditionally considered as two genetically distinct populations, either recently founded or connected by considerable gene flow, is here considered as one panmictic population with a certain probability based on marker data and prior information. Analyses of previously published data on the Moroccan argan tree (Argania spinosa) and of simulated data sets suggest that our method is capable of estimating a population substructure, while not artificially enforcing a substructure when it does not exist.

In reality, however, independent populations in similar environments always show some differences: some nonparallel evolution is present. It is therefore important to explicitly quantify the parallel and nonparallel aspects of trait variation, and to investigate the ecological and genetic explanations for each. We performed such an analysis for threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) populations inhabiting lake and stream habitats in six independent watersheds. Morphological traits differed in the degree to which lake-stream divergence was parallel across watersheds. Some aspects of this variation were correlated with ecological variables related to diet, presumably reflecting the strength and specifics of divergent selection. Furthermore, a genetic scan revealed some markers that diverged between lakes and streams in many of the watersheds and some that diverged in only a few watersheds. Moreover, some of the lake-stream divergence in genetic markers was associated within some of the lake-stream divergence in morphological traits. Our results suggest that parallel evolution, and deviations from it, are primarily the result of natural selection, which corresponds in only some respects to the dichotomous habitat classifications frequently used in such studies.",W1541080281,False,0.8859534859657288

The problem is complicated by convergent evolution in the characters of almost all parts of a fern plant. Not only similar soral form, but also similar frond form, types of venation, scales, etc. have been developed on different evolutionary lines. To illustrate the nature of the problem an attempt has been made to state the probable characters of a primitive leptosporangiate fern, and the kinds of ways in which existing ferns have developed from this condition. Evolutionary change in different parts of the plant has proceeded in different ways and to different degrees in the many genera of existing ferns. Primitive characters of one kind or another are shown by a great number of ferns, along with highly advanced characters of other kinds. Recent schemes of classification are briefly compared, and a summary is given of the author's own scheme, with notes on evolutionary trends in the various groups as he sees them. Much more information is needed on which to establish a really satisfactory scheme. The present one is put forward in the hope that others will take up the work. With modern facilities for travel, it is to be hoped that more botanists will come to the tropics and see ferns and other too‐little‐known plants in their native habitats. Morphological study needs to be undertaken with an understanding of the living plant and of its environment.",W2052754755,False,0.2762455344200134

https://doi.org/10.1086/284480,The Handicap Mechanism of Sexual Selection Does Not Work,"Zahavi (1975) proposed the handicap hypothesis for the adaptive evolution of female mating preferences and sexual selection that involves the joint evolution of a male secondary sexual character (the ""handicap""), mating preferences for that character, and a third trait that affects the viability of individuals of both sexes. Under this hypothesis, when the degrees of expression of the handicap and viability traits are correlated, females that mate with the more handicapped males are selected for, since they bear offspring carrying genes for a high degree of expression of the viability trait. Several types of genetic models of the three characters evolving in a polygynous mating system show that the supposed adaptive evolution of mating preferences does not occur. Rather, there is an infinite continuum of possible evolutionary equilibria, and the female mating preference can equilibrate at any value. The point at which it does equilibrate determines the equilibrium degree of expression for the handicap and viability traits, which may be at points far from their ecological (natural-selection) optima. The qualitative result that female preferences do not consistently evolve in an adaptive manner holds under a variety of conditions, including (1) when the viability and handicap traits are under either stabilizing or directional natural selection, (2) when expression of the handicap is completely determined by nonheritable causes, and (3) when the handicap trait is expressed in both sexes rather than in males alone. These results can be understood in terms of a balance of forces in which the advantage that certain male phenotypes achieve through mating offsets their survival disadvantage. Thus, sexual selection, far from being adaptive, can in fact cause a serious reduction in the average survival rate of individuals in a population. The conclusion these analyses lead to is that in polygynous species in which males contribute only gametes (but not material benefits) to their mates, mating preferences may often evolve in unpredictable ways that do not enhance the average viability or adaptation of the species. For female mating preferences (and hence sexual selection) to evolve in an adaptive manner as suggested by the handicap hypothesis, some additional selective force operating directly on the mating preferences must be at work.",W1964013164,False,0.7552369236946106

We investigate the evolution of female sexual preferences for more than a single male trait by the handicap process. The handicap process assumes that ornaments are indicators of male quality, and a female benefits from mate choice by her offspring inheriting ""good genes"" that increase survival chances. A new handicap model is developed that allows equilibria to be given in terms of selection pressures, independent of genetic parameters. Multiple sexual preferences evolve if the overall cost of choice is not greatly increased by a female using additional male traits in her assessment of potential mates. However, only a single preference is evolutionarily stable if assessment of additional male traits greatly increases the overall cost of choice (more than expected by combining the cost of each preference independently). Any single preference can evolve, the outcome being determined by initial conditions. The evolution of one preference effectively blocks the evolution of others, even for traits that are better indicators of male quality. Comparison is made with sexual selection caused by Fisher's runaway process in which male traits are purely attractive characters. This shows that sexual preferences for multiple Fisher traits are likely to evolve alongside preference for a single handicap trait that indicates male quality. This is a general difference in the evolutionary outcome of these two causes of sexual selection.",W1979294457,False,0.06997395306825638

Two major theories underpin our understanding of how predation risk shapes life history. The first is centred around predator induced changes in activity that subsequently reduce food intake and thus growth. The second is centred around size selective, predator induced changes in development. 2. Here, we challenge these theories using experiments and probabilistic models of maturation reaction norms to investigate predator induced life history in the water flea Daphnia pulex facing two different predators. 3. We combine this reaction norm investigation with an assessment of growth rate, development rate, moult number and moult duration to uncover the mechanisms controlling predator induced life history plasticity when D. pulex face either large or small size selective predators. 4. The probabilistic reaction norms reveal predator specific norms of reaction in size and age along a food gradient. Fish cues reduce age and size, with a bias in age, and do so by reducing moult number and duration. Midge cues increase age and size, with a bias in size, and do so by fine scale modulation of early growth rates. 5.

Sexes might differ in either or both of these responses for homologous traits, which in turn has consequences for sexual dimorphism and its evolution. Here, we investigate both immediate changes in and the evolution of sexual dimorphism in response to a changing environment (with and without fluctuations) using the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. We investigate sex differences in plasticity and also the genetic architecture of body mass and developmental time dimorphism to test two existing hypotheses on sex differences in plasticity (adaptive canalization hypothesis and condition dependence hypothesis). We found a decreased sexual size dimorphism in higher temperature and that females responded more plastically than males, supporting the condition dependence hypothesis. However, selection in a fluctuating environment altered sex‐specific patterns of genetic and environmental variation, indicating support for the adaptive canalization hypothesis. Genetic correlations between sexes ( r MF ) were affected by fluctuating selection, suggesting facilitated independent evolution of the sexes. Thus, the selective past of a population is highly important for the understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of sexual dimorphism.",W1568389563,False,0.163178950548172

Unfortunately, most tests did neglect genetic constraints and interchanged mass with body size which may explain mixed support for some of the models' predictions. We imposed time constraints on full sibling larvae of the damselfly Enallagma cyathigerum by manipulating day length regimes. Under a time constraint, larval development and growth rate based on size indeed were faster. This made it possible to keep size at emergence constant, despite the shorter development time. Interestingly, under a time constraint, growth rate based on mass was not increased and larvae had a lower mass at emergence. We see two reasons for this difference between body mass and size. First, size is fixed at emergence, while mass can still increase in many insects. Secondly, genetic constraints may have contributed to different responses for size and mass. In general, our results strongly suggest discriminating between size and mass when testing life history responses.",W1569399928,False,0.7410282492637634

Furthermore, environmental changes are not constant in time, but fluctuate. Here, we investigate the effect of rapid, continuous and/or fluctuating temperature changes in the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, using an evolution experiment followed by a split-brood experiment. In line with expectations, individuals responded in a plastic way and had an overall higher potential to respond to selection after a rapid change in the environment. After selection in an environment with increasing temperature, plasticity remained unchanged (or decreased) and environmental variation decreased, especially when fluctuations were added; these results were unexpected. As expected, the genetic variation decreased after fluctuating selection. Our results suggest that fluctuations in the environment have major impact on the response of a population to environmental change; in a highly variable environment with low predictability, a plastic response might not be beneficial and the response is genetically and environmentally canalized resulting in a low potential to respond to selection and low environmental sensitivity. Interestingly, we found greater variation for phenotypic plasticity after selection, suggesting that the potential for plasticity to evolve is facilitated after exposure to environmental fluctuations.

,Functional diversity among predators of a freshwater snail imposes an adaptive trade-off for shell morphology,"We explored how functional diversity among predators of the freshwater snail Physa creates an adaptive trade-off for the snail’s shell morphology. Physid shells range continuously between elongate and rotund in overall shape. The protection conferred by alternative shell shapes depends on the mode of attack employed by predators. Predators attack Physa primarily through shell entry (by crayfish, Orconectes obscurus) and shell crushing (by fish, Lepomis gibbosus, Cyprinus carpio, Carrasius auratus). The narrow apertures associated with elongate shells were expected to restrict apertural access by crayfish, as it does in several marine gastropod–decapod interactions. The orbicular body whorls of rotund shells were predicted to disperse better the crushing forces applied by fish. Resistance to one predator then implies susceptibility to the other because shells can be relatively rotund or elongate but not both. Three levels of evidence from this study supported the idea of a trade-off: (1) measurement with laboratory instruments indicated that rotund shells were relatively crush-resistant, whereas elongate shells were more entry-resistant; (2) foraging trials showed that rotund shells required more handling time and were rejected more frequently by fish, whereas snails with elongate shells were more likely to survive with crayfish; and (3) field samples revealed rotund shell morphology in habitats where fish were common. The physical tests, foraging trials and field survey of the present study demonstrate the functional basis for predator-induced plasticity, which has been documented elsewhere for physid shell morphology and serves as a fourth line of support for the existence of an adaptive trade-off. Implications of the trade-off for the behaviour of predators and prey are also discussed.",W1604352775,False,0.8746727108955383

Inducible defences, which can be considered threshold traits, are a form of plasticity that generates ecological and evolutionary consequences. A simple cost–benefit model underpins the maintenance and evolution of these threshold, inducible traits. In this model, a rank‐order switch in expected fitness, defined by costs and benefits of induction between defended and undefended morphs, predicts the risk level at which individuals should induce defences. Here, taking predator‐induced morphological defences in Daphnia pulex as a threshold trait, we provide the first comprehensive investigation into the costs and benefits of a threshold trait, and how they combine to reflect fitness and predict the switchpoint at which induction should occur. We develop reaction norms that show genetic variation in switchpoints. Further experiments show that induction can confer a survival benefit and a cost in terms of lifetime reproductive success. Together, these two traits combine to estimate expected fitness and can predict the switchpoint between an undefended and a defended strategy. The predictions match the reaction norm data for clones that experience these costs and benefits, and correspond well to independent field data on induction. However, predictions do not, and cannot, match for clones that do not gain a benefit from induction. This study confirms that a simple theory, based on life history costs and benefits, is a sufficient framework for understanding the ecology and evolution of inducible, threshold traits.",W1977978746,False,0.5579427480697632

Although many methods exist for clustering gene families, very few attempt to create truly orthologous clusters sharing descent from a single ancestral gene across a range of evolutionary depths. Although these non-phylogenetic gene family clusters have been used broadly for gene annotation, errors are known to be introduced by the artifactual association of slowly evolving paralogs and lack of annotation for those more rapidly evolving. A full phylogenetic framework is necessary for accurate inference of function and for many studies that address pattern and mechanism of the evolution of the genome. The automated generation of evolutionary gene clusters, creation of gene trees, determination of orthology and paralogy relationships, and the correlation of this information with gene annotations, expression information, and genomic context is an important resource to the scientific community. Discussion The PhIGs database currently contains 23 completely sequenced genomes of fungi and metazoans, containing 409,653 genes that have been grouped into 42,645 gene clusters. Each gene cluster is built such that the gene sequence distances are consistent with the known organismal relationships and in so doing, maximizing the likelihood for the clusters to represent truly orthologous genes. The PhIGs website contains tools that allow the study of genes within their phylogenetic framework through keyword searches on annotations, such as GO and InterPro assignments, and sequence similarity searches by BLAST and HMM. In addition to displaying the evolutionary relationships of the genes in each cluster, the website also allows users to view the relative physical positions of homologous genes in specified sets of genomes. Summary Accurate analyses of genes and genomes can only be done within their full phylogenetic context. The PhIGs database and corresponding website address this problem for the scientific community. Our goal is to expand the content as more genomes are sequenced and use this framework to incorporate more analyses.",W1537213512,False,0.4850277900695801

Despite recent interest in the study of animal personalities within behavioural ecology, the field is fraught with conceptual and methodological difficulties inherent in any young discipline. We review the current agreement of definitions and methods used in personality studies across taxa and systems, and find that current methods risk misclassifying traits. Fortunately, these problems have been faced before by other similar fields during their infancy, affording important opportunities to learn from past mistakes. We review the tools that were developed to overcome similar methodological problems in psychology. These tools emphasise the importance of attempting to measure animal personality traits using multiple tests and the care that needs to be taken when interpreting correlations between personality traits or their tests. Accordingly, we suggest an integrative theoretical framework that incorporates these tools to facilitate a robust and unified approach in the study of animal personality.",W1558792683,False,0.8546562790870667

Animal personality represents consistent behavioural individual differences over time and across contexts, and/or correlations between different types of behaviour. In many animal species, individuals differ in activity, aggressiveness, risk-taking and exploratory behaviour, and these behaviours are often positively correlated with each other. We therefore expect that personality affects social behaviour, and that social behaviour also influences personality. New discoveries about the evolutionary ecology of personality suggest exciting research opportunities on the effects of personality on the fate of individuals in social contexts, and on the influences of social interactions on development and evolution of personality.",W1839210107,False,0.6522568464279175

This assumption is often made, sometimes tested using short time intervals between behavioural tests, but rarely thoroughly investigated across long time intervals crossing different stages of ontogeny. We performed such a longitudinal test across three life stages in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), representing about 15-20% of their life span in captivity, and found repeatabilities ranging from 0.03 to 0.67. Fearlessness and exploration were the most repeatable traits both within and across life stages. Activity and aggression were repeatable across, but not or only partly within life stages. Boldness was not repeatable. Furthermore, we found no evidence for a consistent behavioural syndrome structure across ontogeny. Our results indicate that the consistency of behavioural traits and their correlations might be overestimated and suggest that life-long stability of animal personality should not simply be assumed.",W1919314394,False,0.031661827117204666

We investigated within‐ and between‐year repeatabilities of incubation and nestling provisioning and how these two types of parental care were related in a sexually dimorphic species, the house sparrow, Passer domesticus. We found that between‐ and within‐year repeatabilities of feeding rate were high in males and low to moderate in females, but that between‐ and within‐year repeatabilities of incubation time were low to moderate in both sexes. Interestingly, the amount of time during which neither sex incubated significantly predicted the subsequent male feeding rate but not the female feeding rate.

However, an experimental procedure to ensure this assumption has been lacking and, moreover, mothering style was always defined post hoc. The short inter-birth interval and the possibility to cross-foster make the guinea pig a suitable species that has an advantage over primates for this type of study. The maternal behaviour of ten subjects was registered during mothering of four subsequent litters. To challenge a possible consistency of maternal behaviour two variables were manipulated: parentage (own young or adopted young) and the condition of the mothers (pregnant or non-pregnant). The concordances found suggest that behavioural parameters necessary to characterize a mothering style in guinea pigs should contain either locomotor, affiliative or aggressive behaviour. Other behavioural parameters were not found adequate for characterizing mothering styles. As significant concordances of maternal behaviour were found, in spite of the challenges offered, we conclude that guinea-pig mothers consistently differ from each other and hence that 'mothering styles' exist in guinea pigs.",W1494045866,False,0.0016849759267643094

The dyads were then challenged by brief introductions to a novel environment. The challenge revealed that frequency of breaking dyadic contact and levels of play were significantly lower for the VFD infants than for the LFD infants, perhaps as a consequence of less secure attachment.",W1973476646,False,0.4941485822200775

https://doi.org/10.1111/mam.12019,Rating the rat: global patterns and research priorities in impacts and management of rodent pests,"Abstract We report the results of the first systematic assessment of global patterns and research priorities emerging in the field of rodent pest management. We carried out an extensive literature review targeted towards identifying the most relevant rodent pests, their impacts and the most common methods used to control them. We identified three disproportionally important pest species that are characterized by severe, generalist and geographically widespread impacts: the black rat R attus rattus, the N orway rat R attus norvegicus and the house mouse M us musculus. Overall, only 7% of known rodent species may be considered pests. Scansorial (i.e. terrestrial and semi‐arboreal) and fossorial species are generally important as pests, while aquatic and arboreal species have only specific impacts. Impacts of rodent pests on arable crops were studied most, followed by impacts on ecosystems. Studies on arable crops were typical in countries with low net income and health expenditure, while the opposite was observed for studies on ecosystems. Poisons were the most commonly used control method, followed by traps and habitat management. The need to control rodent species is expanding, especially to protect ecosystems and public health. Unlike in other fields of pest management (e.g. insect control), in rodent control we are approaching new problems with old solutions; control strategies and methods have not kept pace with emerging impacts. The need to control a rodent pest species is higher when it is non‐native than within its original geographical range. The impact of a rodent species in its native range is a good predictor of the impact it may have in areas of introduction. Our review will contribute towards guiding researchers and stakeholders to focus research efforts and investments on a subset of species, and on new, less hazardous control techniques.",W1500610403,False,0.6222242712974548

Fertility control could reduce these impacts. Virally vectored immunocontraception (VVIC) has been proposed as an economic way to achieve this. However, the ability of an immunocontraceptive virus to control populations may be compromised if: (i) sufficient infected mice are not made infertile; (ii) the virus does not transmit at a sufficient rate; (iii) there is competition with field strains of virus; or (iv) its ability to induce infertility is altered by the presence of field strains. We tested this with stochastic, individual-based, disease–host models based on murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and house mice Mus musculus domesticus. 2 Using field estimates of the MCMV transmission rate, immunocontraceptive MCMV (icMCMV) could prevent mouse populations from growing rapidly to damaging levels provided > 70% of mice infected with the virus became infertile. Successful control was possible even if engineering icMCMV reduced its transmission rate to c. 30% of the field-estimated value, but greater reductions in the transmission rate compromised successful control. 3 Effective control was compromised if there was competition between icMCMV and field strains because of cross-immunity to infection or if previous infection with field strains blocked the development of infertility in mice subsequently infected with icMCMV. In these cases effectiveness was diminished, particularly if the transmission rate of icMCMV was reduced relative to field strains, or if close to 100% infertility of infected mice could not be achieved. If the blocking developed early after infection with field strains, doubling the transmission rate of icMCMV relative to field strains still could not produce successful control. 4 Synthesis and applications. VVIC requires preliminary estimates of its efficacy to satisfy regulatory requirements before it can be released into the environment. Our models indicate that successful control of an outbreaking species using VVIC is possible if high levels of infertility can be achieved, but this is compromised by cross-strain protection and low transmission rates of engineered virus. Future research effort should focus on determining whether these compromising effects occur for specific engineered viruses and, if so, whether they can be overcome.",W1491455471,False,0.22764530777931213
https://doi.org/10.1002/ps.3354,Fertility control of rodent pests: a review of the inhibitory effects of plant extracts on ovarian function,"Plant extracts can inhibit fertility by adversely affecting, directly or indirectly, reproductive processes ranging from gonadal function and development to gestation. This review focuses on plant extracts that disrupt ovarian function in rodents.Extracts from at least 40 plant species exert some of their disruptive reproductive effects at the ovarian level. Of those, 13 plants induce a reduction in the number and type of ovarian follicles and also cause disruption to the oestrous cycle. Their effects are short term and reversible once treatment ceases.Protection of plant extracts to prevent their degradation before uptake in the gastrointestinal tract could enhance short-term efficacy but would not enhance the longevity of their effects. Identification and further testing of the specific chemicals responsible for reproductive effects would be beneficial. The adoption of a standard protocol for treatment and assessment of the inhibitory effects of potential control agents on reproductive function in rodents is essential. Treatment with higher concentrations of extracts in conjunction with other extracts or with other chemosterilants could have potential complementary effects and lead to more rapid and permanent changes in ovarian function. An orally delivered agent(s) that causes major depletion of all follicle types, and particularly of non-regenerating primordial follicles, could be an ideal fertility control product and serve as an additional tool for population control of pest rodents.",W1524961958,False,0.040327612310647964

Despite the promise that triptolide would not affect testis function, nagging concerns remained that a delayed onset of testicular effect might exist. The objectives of this study were to assess the effects of relatively longer treatment duration of triptolide on fertility, spermatogenesis, and epididymal sperm pathophysiology; and to evaluate the reversibility of these effects after the cessation of treatment. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed daily with either 30% gum acacia as a vehicle control (n = 12) or 100 microg/kg body weight (BW) of triptolide for 82 days (n = 12) followed by a recovery period of up to 14 weeks (n = 6). At the end of the treatment period, all rats treated with triptolide were sterile. Cauda epididymal sperm content decreased by 84.8% and sperm motility was reduced to zero. In addition, virtually all cauda epididymal sperm in the triptolide-treated group exhibited severe structural abnormalities. The most striking changes observed were head-tail separation, premature chromatin decondensation of sperm nuclei, a complete absence of the plasma membrane of the entire middle and principle pieces, disorganization of the mitochondrial sheath, and aggregation of many sperm tails. Longer treatment duration of triptolide also affected spermatogenesis, with marked variability in the response of individual animals. The degree of damage ranged from apparently normal-looking seminiferous tubules to flattened seminiferous epithelium lined by a single layer of cells consisting of Sertoli cells and a few spermatogonia. Affected tubules exhibited intraepithelial vacuoles of varying sizes, multinucleated giant cells, germ cell exfoliation, and tubular atrophy. Recovery occurred as early as 6 weeks after cessation of treatment. By 14 weeks, 4 out of 6 triptolide-treated males were fertile and the females that were impregnated by 3 out of 4 triptolide-treated male rats produced apparently normal litters. These results suggest that triptolide has 2 phenotypic effects on mature and maturing germ cells. The first action appears earlier and manifests mainly in epididymal sperm. The second action presumably is directly on germ cells in testis and causes a variable impairment of spermatogenesis that may not be completely reversible. It is unclear if the earlier effect is a delayed manifestation of subtle testicular injury or post-testicular action.",W1604920482,False,0.057193104177713394

It also persists in low population densities of mice, although if population densities are low for at least a year, transmission of the virus is sporadic until a population threshold of approximately 40 mice ha(-1) is reached. The serological prevalence of MCMV was high early in the breeding season of four field populations. Enclosure studies confirm that MCMV has minimal impact on the survival and breeding performance of mice and that it can be transmitted to most adults within 10-12 weeks. Other enclosure studies indicate that about two-thirds of females would need to be sterilized to provide effective control of the rate of growth of mouse populations. If this level is not maintained for 20-25 weeks after the commencement of breeding, the mouse population can compensate through increased recruitment per breeding female. The findings from this series of descriptive and manipulative population studies of mice support the contention that MCMV would be a good carrier for an immunocontraceptive vaccine required to sustain female sterility levels at or above 65%.",W1575168898,False,0.8481401801109314
https://doi.org/10.1530/jrf.0.0600001,Gonadotrophin-induced reinitiation of meiosis in testes of oestradiol-treated prepubertal rats,"Summary. Male rats injected with 50 μg oestradiol dipropionate every 5 days from birth were given daily injections of 20 i.u. PMSG from 20 to 29 days of age. Testicular weight and cell number remained relatively constant in rats treated only with oestradiol and were significantly below normal levels, but were significantly increased in PMSG-treated animals. Dissociated cells from PMSG-treated rats incorporated 560% as much [3H]thymidine as did cells from oestradiol-treated animals at 21 days, and 240% at 29 days. The increase was due to new cells entering the S-phase, as indicated by an increase in the labelling index. Autoradiographic examination of testicular tissue indicated that PMSG stimulated DNA synthesis in meiotic and somatic cells. The number of labelled germinal cells increased and numerous pachytene spermatocytes were observed after 6–9 days of treatment. Myoid and interstitial cells were markedly stimulated by PMSG. The presence of spermatids in 26- and 29-day-old PMSG-treated animals indicated rescue of pachytene spermatocytes destined to degenerate after oestradiol administration. It is concluded that the hormonal control of the meiotic process is similar in prepubertal and adult rats.",W1966609006,False,0.003960374742746353

The rate of photosynthesis (measured in growth conditions) and plant growth were not strongly inhibited until almost half of the Rubisco was removed. When Rubisco was decreased further there was a large decrease of photosynthesis and plant growth. When photosynthesis decreased in the ‘antisense’ plants there was an increase in the shoot/root ratio and the specific leaf area. As a result, the leaf area ratio (leaf area per g plant dry weight) increased 3–4–fold. This shows that tobacco compensates for decreased photosynthesis by maximizing leaf area. The decrease of photosynthesis also resulted in lower starch and free hexose in the leaf, but the volume of the diurnal starch turnover was largely maintained. This indicates that partitioning to starch is regulated to decrease non‐productive accumulation of starch, but still maintain a pool of transient starch for export during the night. The decrease of photosynthesis was also accompanied by a large increase of the nitrogen/ carbon balance, due to a large accumulation of nitrate in the leaf. This shows that assimilation of nitrate is inhibited in response to low availability of photo‐synthate.",W1981458431,False,0.8310357332229614

,Effet des vers de terre tropicaux géophages sur la dynamique de la matière organique du sol dans les savanes humides,"Dans de nombreux pays tropicaux humides, la culture itinerante sur brulis, pratiquee depuis des millenaires, ne suffit plus aujourd'hui a nourrir des populations humaines de plus en plus nombreuses. Le contexte economique de ces pays ne permettant pas d'augmenter la productivite des cultures par l'apport d'engrais, seules sont envisageables des solutions peu couteuses telles que l'exploitation des systemes biologiques de regulation des sols intervenant notamment au sein de la rhizospheres (mycorhizes, fixateurs d'azote) ou de la drilosphere (ensemble du sol soumis a l'action des vers de terre). Le but de ce travail est de caracteriser les consequences des interactions mutualistes que les vers de terre tropicaux endoges entretiennent avec la microfore du sol, sur la dynamique de la matiere organique du sol (MOS). Une etape preliminaire a consiste a estimer le taux de renouvellement global de la MOS dans un sol de savane humide de Cote d'Ivoire en conditions de terrain et a caracteriser des compartiments organiques fonctionnellement heterogenes. L'assimilabilite de ces compartiments organiques du sol par un ver de terre tropical geophage africain, a ensuite ete testee par l'utilisation de traceurs (¹⁴C, ¹³C). Enfin, les consequences de l'activite digestive de deux especes tropicales geophages sur la dynamique de la MOS ont ete etudiees : une etude a court terme visait a quantifier la perte de MOS engendree par la digestion du ver dans le sol ingere. Dans une etude a long terme, on a compare la dynamique de la MOS incluse au sein des turricules, a celle de la MOS incluse dans le sol d'elevage en conditions optimales de mineralisation. L'essentiel de l'etude a ete realisee sur les sols des savanes tropicales humides de Lamto (Cote d'Ivoire). Une parcelle de savane herbeuse (a graminees C4) recolonisee depuis 16 ans par une vegetation forestiere (plantes C3) y fourni un site experimental ideal pour estimer le taux de renouvellement de la MOS in situ par mesure des l'abondance naturelle du ¹³C (δ¹³C ). Le changement de vegetation C4/C3 a engendre un appauvrissement en ¹³C de la MOS et la mesure actuelle du δ¹³C de la MOS de cette parcelle a permis de mettre en evidence que pres de 60% du stock organique de l'horizon 0-10 cm du sol ont ete mineralises en 16 ans. Le fractionnement granulometrique de la MOS contenu dans cet horizon a revele l'existence d'une heterogeneite fonctionnelle entre les differentes fractions organiques par taille: les fractions > 50 µm ont ete mineralisees en presque totalite en 16 ans (turn-over rapide), alors que seuls 43 a 48% des fractions < a 50 µm avaient disparu (turn-over lent). Les interactions entre les vers de terre tropicaux geophages et la MOS ont alors ete etudiees en prenant en compte l'heterogeneite fonctionnelle des differents compartiments organiques distingues par leur taille. Deux especes de ver ont ete utilisees : Millsonia anomala est une espece endogee mesohumique, qui domine les peuplements de vers dans les savanes humides de Lamto (Cote d'Ivoire). Les individus appartenant a cette espece representent, dans ce type de milieu, une biomasse de 150 a 350kg. Ha‾¹ et ingerent annuellement 800 a 1200t. Ha‾¹de terre, pour l'essentiel entre 0 et 15 cm de profondeur. Quelques donnees ont egalement ete obtenues pour l'espece Pontoscolex corethrurus, un ver de terre geophage polyhumique repandu dans toute la zone intertropicale. L'assimilation de la MOS par M. Anomala a ete suivie grâce a l'utilisation de traceurs (¹⁴C, ¹³C). Dans une premiere serie d'experiences des debris vegetaux marques au ¹⁴C ont ete incubes dans un sol pendant 0. 25, 1 ou 3 an puis on a eleve pendant 21 jours de jeunes individus dans des bocaux hermetiques contenant ce sol marque. La mesure de l'activite specifique des vers en fin d'experience a montre que les vers assimilent avec une meilleure efficacite les residus vegetaux preincubes pendant un an. Parallelement, les degagements de CO₂ (¹⁴CO₂,¹²CO₂) ont ete mesures dans les bocaux avec et sans ver (temoin) afin d'estimer les pertes de C engendrees par la respiration du ver.",W113749772,False,0.778104305267334

The first committed step in the formation of the various terpenoid classes is the transformation of the prenyl diphosphate precursors, geranyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate, and geranylgeranyl diphosphate, to the parent structures of each type catalyzed by the respective monoterpene (C10), sesquiterpene (C15), and diterpene synthases (C20). Over 30 cDNAs encoding plant terpenoid synthases involved in primary and secondary metabolism have been cloned and characterized. Here we describe the isolation and analysis of six genomic clones encoding terpene synthases of conifers, [(-)-pinene (C10), (-)-limonene (C10), (E)-α-bisabolene (C15), δ-selinene (C15), and abietadiene synthase (C20) from Abies grandis and taxadiene synthase (C20) from Taxus brevifolia], all of which are involved in natural products biosynthesis. Genome organization (intron number, size, placement and phase, and exon size) of these gymnosperm terpene synthases was compared to eight previously characterized angiosperm terpene synthase genes and to six putative terpene synthase genomic sequences from Arabidopsis thaliana. Three distinct classes of terpene synthase genes were discerned, from which assumed patterns of sequential intron loss and the loss of an unusual internal sequence element suggest that the ancestral terpenoid synthase gene resembled a contemporary conifer diterpene synthase gene in containing at least 12 introns and 13 exons of conserved size. A model presented for the evolutionary history of plant terpene synthases suggests that this superfamily of genes responsible for natural products biosynthesis derived from terpene synthase genes involved in primary metabolism by duplication and divergence in structural and functional specialization. This novel molecular evolutionary approach focused on genes of secondary metabolism may have broad implications for the origins of natural products and for plant phylogenetics in general.",W1900517450,False,0.2449716478586197

Internal amino acid sequences of the purified enzyme from spearmint oil glands were utilized to design three distinct oligonucleotide probes. These probes were subsequently employed to screen a spearmint leaf cDNA library, and four clones were isolated. Three of these cDNA isolates were full-length and were functionally expressed in Escherichia coli, yielding a peptide that is immunologically recognized by polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified limonene synthase from spearmint and that is catalytically active in generating from geranyl pyrophosphate a product distribution identical to that of the native enzyme (principally limonene with small amounts of the coproducts alpha- and beta-pinene and myrcene). The longest open reading frame is 1800 nucleotides and the deduced amino acid sequence contains a putative plastidial transit peptide of approximately 90 amino acids and a mature protein of about 510 residues corresponding to the native enzyme. Several nucleotide differences in the 5'-untranslated region of all three full-length clones suggest the presence of several limonene synthase genes and/or alleles in the allotetraploid spearmint genome.

The clone encodes a 40,483-dalton polypeptide of 342 amino acids with a high degree of similarity to the protein encoded by a putative rat liver clone of FPP synthetase (Clarke, C. F., Tanaka, R.

Characterization of the structural gene encoding hexaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase.,"The assembly of a polyisoprenoid side chain and its transfer to para-hydroxybenzoate are the first two steps of coenzyme Q biosynthesis. In yeast these reactions are catalyzed by hexaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase and PHB:polyprenyltransferase, respectively. We have screened nine complementation groups of yeast coenzyme Q mutants for the activities of these two enzymes and found two strains deficient in either activity. The strain deficient in hexaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase activity, C296-LH3, is complemented by the plasmid pG3/T1. When C296-LH3 was transformed with a shuttle vector containing a 2,187-base pair fragment from the genomic insert of pG3/T1, both glycerol growth and hexaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase activity were restored. The activity of the latter enzyme was higher than that seen in wild-type yeast. The increase in activity could be attributed to a gene dosage effect of the multi-copy plasmid. A 1,419-base pair open reading frame encoding a 52,560-dalton protein was found on the genomic fragment. The size of the RNA transcript and the location of transcriptional initiation indicate that the entire open reading frame is contained within the mRNA.

E-mail: makoski@touko.helsinki.fi ABSTRACT: Rates of body growth, development and egg production of Pseudocalanus elongatus were measured in the laboratory, in relation to the taxonomy and physiology of algal food. Four types of experiments were performed to measure the copepod's response to (1) 7 algal species of similar size and shape, but different taxonomic groups, (2) inferior food species that were offered with good food as a check of toxicity, (3) nitrogen limitation and the growth rate of food species, and (4) highly unsaturated fatty acids that were supplied with inferior food to test for lack of essential fatty acids. Grazing was measured to check that the offered food was really ingested. The best food species proved to be Rhodomonas sp., which induced a fast rate of development, good somatic growth and egg production and low mortality. The development rate was almost equally fast with Thalassiosira weissflogii, Gymnodinium simplex and Tetraselmis suecica, but the rates of somatic growth or egg production were lower and mortality generally higher than with Rhodomonas sp. Three algal species, Dunaliella sp., Amphidinium sp. and Chrysochromulina polylepis, were poor food; copepod development was not completed, the rates of somatic growth and egg production were low and mortality was high. Ingestion was equally high with most of the species; only C. polylepis was not eaten. No clear toxic effects were found when the 3 poor-food species were offered in mixtures with Rhodomonas sp. N-limited Rhodomonas sp. did not reduce the rate of copepod development in comparison to a N-replete culture; however, N-limited T. weissflogii reduced the development rate to the low level of poor-food species. No effect of different growth rates of Dunaliella sp. was found. Lipids rich in highly unsaturated fatty acids supplied with Dunaliella sp. did not substantially improve the slow development and low egg production observed with this species. The weight-specific somatic growth rate was always higher than the weight-specific egg production rate, especially with less optimal food, which seems to hamper the estimation of the secondary production of copepods based on egg production alone. It is concluded that large differences in the food quality of different algal species are due to differences in digestibility or in mineral and biochemical composition.

This is now done by dialysis and evaporation under reduced pressure. The toxin molecule must be large, as it cannot penetrate a dialysis membrane; it is soluble in water and the lower alcohols, but insoluble in ether and chloroform. It is unstable in acids, turning into another toxic product, and is decomposed by hot alkali, though in neutral solution is more or less thermostable. The toxin as it occurs in sea water is not the same as paralytic shellfish poison, but there are some resemblances between this and the 'acid extract', though much more work is needed to check this point. The action of the toxin on a variety of animals is described, and an attempt is made to devise an approximate assay technique using gobies as the test animals. The action has also been observed on a range of isolated preparations, and although the final conclusion as to the mode of action is not quite clear, we feel confident that the site of action in whole animals is in the nervous system, probably acting on ganglion transmission. With regard to the mode of action it depolarizes nerve and muscle membranes. It also abolishes the potential across frog skin without measurably altering the skin resistance. This depolarization probably occurs by interference with the sodium exchange mechanism, allowing rapid entry of sodium into the cells.",W1963964735,False,0.010223910212516785

Carbohydrate production did not parallel cell numbers during exponential growth of any of these organisms; maximum concentrations during this phase were under 3 mg/L. Carbohydrates accumulated in all stationary cultures (having 10 6 –10 7 cells/ml), to the greatest extent in Prymnesium cultures, which attained 123 mg/L. Isochrysis and Monochrysis produced 25 and 16 mg/L, respectively, while the others had under 10 mg/L even when cell disintegration was evident. Aging cultures (not all bacteria‐free) of 4 diatoms, 2 dinoflagellates, 2 additional green algae, and a cyanophyte were assayed. Concentrations ranged from 1.5 to 60 mg/L. This suggests that the organisms studied contribute significant free carbohydrates only during late bloom conditions, when algae are abundant and under physiological circumstances resembling stationary or declining culture.",W2140139995,False,0.8793027997016907

Here we compile data from 18 European countries to assess trends in the number of honey bee colonies and beekeepers between 1965 and 2005. We found consistent declines in colony numbers in central European countries and some increases in Mediterranean countries. Beekeeper numbers have declined in all of the European countries examined. Our data support the view that honey bees are in decline at least in some regions, which is probably closely linked to the decreasing number of beekeepers. Our data on colony numbers and beekeepers must, however, be interpreted with caution due to different approaches and socioeconomic factors in the various countries, thereby limiting their comparability. We therefore make specific recommendations for standardized methodologies to be adopted at the national and global level to assist in the future monitoring of honey bees.",W1971894182,False,0.27962619066238403

Conditions associated with selective behaviour were detected by following freely foraging bees and collecting flowers that they visited. Two types of selectivity were observed in four of thirteen groups of ten to fifteen bees: a preference for larger than average flowers when all flowers of a particular species were shallower than the lengths of the bees' glossae (= tongues); or a positive correlation between glossa length and the depth of flowers visited when glossa length approximately equalled flower depth. To explain these results an energetic model was developed based jointly on the dependence of a bee's probing time on glossa length and flower depth, and a positive correlation between flower depth and nectar production. This model was tested by an experiment with different-sized artificial flowers which contained volumes of sugar solution in direct relation to flower size. Because all flowers were shallower than the glossa lengths of the tested bees, a preference for the largest flowers was expected. Over a series of trials three of four bees fed in the expected pattern. Selective behaviour was reflected in very different patterns of size-related flower visitation, which depended on the particular characteristics of both bees and flowers.",W1973045522,False,0.4877358376979828

,"Insectes pollinisateurs dans les paysages agricoles : approche pluri-échelle du rôle des habitats semi-naturels, des pratiques agricoles et des cultures entomophiles","pollinisateurs (abeilles et syrphes) dans les paysages agricoles, en presence d'une culture entomophile, le colza. Son originalite reside dans la prise en compte des pratiques agricoles, et non pas uniquement de la quantite d'habitats semi-naturels, pour evaluer l'impact de l'intensification agricole. A l'echelle de 14 sites europeens, les abeilles sont affectees negativement par l'intensification agricole (mesuree par la quantite de pesticides et fertilisants azotes et par la charge en betail) et positivement par la quantite d'habitats semi-naturels. A l'echelle du paysage, nous avons montre que : (1) les abeilles et les syrphes se concentrent au niveau des parcelles de colza, culture nectarifere fortement attractive ; (2) le role des habitats semi-naturels differe en fonction du type de paysage : dans le bocage, les haies et les prairies jouent un role important ; dans l'openfield, les chemins (sites de nidification des abeilles terricoles) et les bordures de parcelles (sources de fleurs) semblent jouer un role majeur ; (3) une analyse de l'histoire recente (sur 5 ans) met en evidence le role positif de la presence de prairies temporaires dans les rotations culturales sur la richesse specifique des abeilles solitaires. Une etude de la repartition spatiale des insectes pollinisateurs au sein des parcelles de colza indique que (1) dans le bocage, l'ensemble des insectes consideres utilise a la fois les bordures et l'interieur des parcelles. Les bourdons, dont les capacites de vol sont les plus importantes, frequentent preferentiellement le centre des parcelles, ou nous avons montre que la quantite de ressources est maximale ; (2) dans l'openfield, ou la surface en colza est plus elevee, nous observons un effet « dilution », qui rend plus difficile la comprehension du comportement des insectes.

The visitng rate of the honeybees to the various species was investigated. The nectar is secreted from the asymmetrically thick, disc-like nectary, through modified stomata. These occur on the thicker side of the nectary only. There is a correlation between the volume of the nectary and the amount of nectar secreted. The larger the nectary, the more nectar it secretes. No correlation was found between the type of vascular tissue (phloem, xylem) and the sugar concentration in the nectar, Rosmarinus officinalis and Coridothymus capitatus were the species most frequently visited by honeybees. The quantitative relationship between sucrose, glucose and fructose differed in the various species examined. Three groups of species were distinguished: 1. Melissa and Rosmarinus, in which the amount of hexoses was equal to that of sucrose; 2. Coridothymus, Salvia judaica and Stachys, in which the hexoses were dominant; 3. Phlomis, Salvia fruticosa and Satureja, in which sucrose was dominant. The concentration of the amino acids in the nectar was, in general, low.

The total abundance of bacteria in water samples generally increased in response to larvae, including populations of cultivable, facultatively anaerobic bacteria. Additionally, a portion of the community shifted from Pseudomonaceae to Enterobacteriaceae. Bacterial abundance on leaf material was significantly reduced in the presence of actively feeding larvae. Principle-component analysis of whole community fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles showed that larvae changed the microbial community structure in both the water column and the leaf material. Cyclopropyl FAMEs, typically associated with bacteria, were reduced in microcosms containing larvae; however, other bacterial fatty acids showed no consistent response. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids characteristic of microeukaryotes (protozoans and meiofauna) declined in abundance when larvae were present, indicating that larval feeding reduced the densities of these microorganisms. However, presumed fungal lipid markers either increased or were unchanged in response to larvae. Larval presence also affected microbial nitrogen metabolism through modification of the physiochemical conditions or by grazing on populations of bacteria involved in nitrification-denitrification. Stemflow primarily influenced inorganic ion and organic compound concentrations in the microcosms and had less-pronounced effects on microbial community parameters than did larval presence. Stemflow treatments diluted concentrations of all inorganic ions (chloride, sulfate, and ammonium) and organic compounds (total dissolved organic carbon, soluble carbohydrates, and total protein) measured, with the exceptions of nitrite and nitrate. Stemflow addition did not measurably affect larval biomass in the microcosms but did enhance development rates and early emergence patterns of adults.",W1489164720,False,0.856858491897583

(MIDI), system. The biomass, taxonomic structure, and expected MIDI-FAME profiles under a variety of environmental conditions were known for these model communities a priori. Not all members of each community could be detected in the composite profile because of lack of fatty acid “signatures” in some isolates or because of variations (approximately fivefold) in fatty acid yield across taxa. MIDI-FAME profiles of replicate subsamples of a given community were similar in terms of fatty acid yield per unit of community dry weight and relative proportions of specific fatty acids. Principal-components analysis (PCA) of MIDI-FAME profiles resulted in a clear separation of the two different communities and a clustering of replicates of each community from two separate experiments on the first PCA axis. The first PCA axis accounted for 57.1% of the variance in the data and was correlated with fatty acids that varied significantly between communities and reflected the underlying community taxonomic structure. On the basis of our data, community fatty acid profiles can be used to assess the relative similarities and differences of microbial communities that differ in taxonomic composition. However, detailed interpretation of community fatty acid profiles in terms of biomass or community taxonomic composition must be viewed with caution until our knowledge of the quantitative and qualitative distribution of fatty acids over a wide variety of taxa and the effects of growth conditions on fatty acid profiles is more extensive.",W1487313274,False,0.4457550048828125

Treatment effects were quantified by statistical analyses of the mole percentage distribution of the individual fatty acids. Changes in the concentrations of individual fatty acids over a 7-week storage period at 4.5°C were generally not statistically significant. Sieving effects (mesh size, 4 or 2 mm) on CO 2 evolution and the PLFA profile were monitored over 3 weeks; the physical disturbance had only minor effects, although some damage to fungal hyphae by the first sieving (&lt;4 mm) was suggested by a decrease in the signature fatty acid 18:2 ω6 c. Temperature effects were investigated by incubating soil for up to 3 weeks at 4.5, 10, or 25°C. Principal component analyses demonstrated a significant shift in the PLFA composition at 25°C over the first 2 weeks, while changes at the other two temperatures were minor. Several of the changes observed at 25°C could be explained with reference to mechanisms of temperature adaptation or as a response to conditions of stress, including a decrease in the degree of unsaturation, an increased production of cyclopropyl fatty acids, and increased ratios of the branched-chain fatty acids iso -15:0 and iso -17:0 over anteiso -15:0 and anteiso -17:0, respectively.

Irrespective of algorithms applied to the set of 16S rRNA gene sequences of type strains, Tropheryma whipplei and Actinotalea fermentans branch deeply and have Cellulomonas bogoriensis as their phylogenetic neighbor. Based upon the fragmentary phenotypic data on Tropheryma whipplei and comparative analysis of full genome sequences of some members of the suborder Micrococcineae, the position of the genus Tropheryma must be considered tentative. Members of the family are defined by awide range of morphological and chemotaxonomic properties, such as polar lipids, fatty acids, amino acids of peptidoglycan, and whole cell sugars which are used for the delination of genera and species. Members of the family are mainly found in soil, but they have been isolated from patient material and the marine environment as well. Many species are described for their ability to decompose not only plant-derived macromolecules such as cellulose, starch, andxanthan butalsochitin, DNA, andgelatine.

The pollution raised the pH of the humus layer from 4.1 to 6.6. Total bacterial numbers and the total amounts of bacterial phospholipid fatty acids in the humus layer did not differ between the unpolluted control sites and the polluted ones. The number of CFU increased by a factor of 6.4 in the polluted sites compared with the controls, while the bacterial growth rate, measured by the thymidine incorporation technique, increased about 1.8-fold in the polluted sites. A shift in the pattern of phospholipid fatty acids indicated a shift in the bacterial species composition. The largest proportional increase was found for the fatty acid 10Me18:0, which indicated an increase in the number of actinomycetes in the polluted sites.

A total of 63 fatty acids in the range of C 10 to C 24 were determined. They consist of saturated fatty acids, branched fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and variation was revealed in the relative proportions of these fatty acids in sediments. On the basis of the PLFA concentration in sediments, the calculated microbial biomass showed variation (mean ± standard deviation = 0.70 × 10 8 ± 0.53 × 10 8 cells per g [dry weight] of sediment) in the eutrophic bays. In sediments, a higher amount of biomass was observed in the coastal area of Hiroshima Bay than that observed in the rest of the bay and adjacent Aki Nada. The microbial community structure of the present study area, as characterized by the PLFA profiles, showed very low percentages of polyunsaturated fatty acids and long-chain fatty acids characteristic of microeukary-otes and terrestrial input, respectively, and high percentages of fatty acids characteristic of bacteria. The distribution of PLFA profiles also showed the relative contribution of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, especially sulfate-reducing bacteria, in the study area. The relative proportions of PLFA revealed distinctive differences among the stations of the study area, as is evidenced from six clusters obtained for the PLFA profiles. The results of Tukey's honestly significant difference test further confirmed that the sediments in the coastal area of Hiroshima Bay were significantly enriched by a number of fatty acids when compared with other areas investigated where relatively few fatty acids were present in significant quantities. No marked variation in environmental parameters in the surface- and bottom-water samples was observed, indicating the absence of any water movement in the study area. Furthermore, low redox potential and the levels of sulfide in the sediment revealed the reduced condition of the sediment. The existing environmental conditions and pollution of the study area were attributed to the observed microbial community structure in the sediments.",W1505633620,False,0.7586371898651123

Statistically significant trends were noted in the fatty acid profiles as the cells starved. The amount of the cis-monoenoic fatty acids declined (e.g., 16:1 omega 7c: 0 day, 39%; 7 day, 18%; 30 day, 11%). In contrast, the saturated fatty acids, the cyclopropyl derivatives of the cis-monoenoic fatty acids, and trans-monoenoic fatty acids increased during starvation. For instance, the amounts of 16:1 omega 7t were: 0 day, 1%; 7 day, 13%; 30 day, 17%; which increased the trans/cis ratio for 16:1 omega 7 from 0.02 (0 day) to 0.70 (7 day) to 1.56 (30 day). This may be due to the reported high turnover rates of cis-monoenoic fatty acids of membrane phospholipids and the availability of enzymes for the metabolism of these isomers. During starvation-induced phospholipid loss, the cis-monoenoic fatty acids would, therefore, be preferentially utilized. The ability to either synthesize trans-monoenoic acids (which are not easily metabolized by bacteria) or modify the more volatile cis-monoenoic acids to their cyclopropyl derivatives may be a survival mechanism which helps maintain a functional (although structurally altered) membrane during starvation-induced lipid utilization. In addition, a trans/cis fatty acid ratio significantly greater than that reported for most bacterial cultures and environmental samples (less than 0.1) may be used as a starvation or stress lipid index. Such a ratio could help determine the nutritional status of ultramicrobacteria and other reported dormant cells in natural aquatic environments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",W1555500408,False,0.21859489381313324

The extraordinary resolution of glass capillary gas-liquid chromatography can be utilized to separate and tentatively identify large numbers of fatty acid methyl esters derived from the lipids of estuarine detritus and marine benthic microbiota without the bias of selective methods requiring culture or recovery of the microbes. The gas-liquid chromatographic analyses are both reproducible and highly sensitive, and the recovery of fatty acids is quantitative. The analyses can be automated, and the diagnostic technique of mass spectral fragmentation analysis can be readily applied. Splitless injection on glass capillary gas chromatographic columns detected by mass spectral selective ion monitoring provides an ultrasensitive and definitive monitoring system. Reciprocal mixtures of bacteria and fungi, when extracted and analyzed, showed progressive changes of distinctive fatty acid methyl esters derived from the lipids. By manipulating the environment of an estuarine detrital microbial community with antibiotics and culture conditions, it was possible to produce a community greatly enriched in eucaryotic fungi, as evidenced by scanning electron microscopic morphology. The fatty acid methyl esters from the lipids in the fungus-enriched detritus showed enrichment of the C 18 dienoic and the C 18 and C 20 polyenoic esters. Manipulation of the detrital microbiota that increased the procaryotic population resulted in an absence of large structures typical of fungal mycelia or diatoms, as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy, and a significantly larger proportion of anteiso- and isobranched C 15 fatty acid esters, C 17 cyclopropane fatty acid esters, and the cis -vaccenic isomer of the C 18 monoenoic fatty acid esters.

Key to such an understanding is the detailed mapping of the natural genomic and phenomic space and a bridging of the gap that separates these worlds. Here we chart a high-resolution map of natural trait variation in one of the most important genetic model organisms, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and its closest wild relatives and trace the genetic basis and timing of major phenotype changing events in its recent history. We show that natural trait variation in S. cerevisiae exceeds that of its relatives, despite limited genetic variation, and follows the population history rather than the source environment. In particular, the West African population is phenotypically unique, with an extreme abundance of low-performance alleles, notably a premature translational termination signal in GAL3 that cause inability to utilize galactose. Our observations suggest that many S. cerevisiae traits may be the consequence of genetic drift rather than selection, in line with the assumption that natural yeast lineages are remnants of recent population bottlenecks. Disconcertingly, the universal type strain S288C was found to be highly atypical, highlighting the danger of extrapolating gene-trait connections obtained in mosaic, lab-domesticated lineages to the species as a whole.

Few examples exist regarding the dispensability of signaling networks, and it remains unclear whether they are an essential feature of a highly adapted biological system. Here, we show that signaling network function carries a fitness cost in yeast evolving in a constant environment. We performed whole-genome, whole-population Illumina sequencing on replicate evolution experiments and find the major theme of adaptive evolution in a constant environment is the disruption of signaling networks responsible for regulating the response to environmental perturbations. Over half of all identified mutations occurred in three major signaling networks that regulate growth control: glucose signaling, Ras/cAMP/PKA and HOG. This results in a loss of environmental sensitivity that is reproducible across experiments. However, adaptive clones show reduced viability under starvation conditions, demonstrating an evolutionary tradeoff. These mutations are beneficial in an environment with a constant and predictable nutrient supply, likely because they result in constitutive growth, but reduce fitness in an environment where nutrient supply is not constant. Our results are a clear example of the myopic nature of evolution: a loss of environmental sensitivity in a constant environment is adaptive in the short term, but maladaptive should the environment change.",W1963670229,False,0.31851866841316223

A general formula is derived to calculate the evolutionarily stable mutation rate mu(ess) in an infinitely large haploid population, and following results are obtained. (I) For any fluctuation, periodic or random: (1) if the recombination rate r per generation between the modifier and the main locus is 0, mu(ess) is the same as the optimal mutation rate mu(op) which maximizes the long-term geometric average of population fitness; and (2) for any r, if the strength s of selection per generation is very large, mu(ess) is equal to the reciprocal of the average number T of generations (duration time) during which one allele is persistently favored than the other. (II) For a periodic fluctuation in the limit of small s and r, mu(ess)T is a function of sT and rT with properties: (1) for a given sT, mu(ess)T decreases with increasing rT; (2) for sT &amp;lt;/= 1, mu(ess)T is almost independent of sT, and depends on rT as mu(ess)T &amp; 1.6 for rT &amp;lt; 1 and mu(ess)T &amp; 6/rT for rT &amp;gt; 1; and (3) for sT &amp;gt;/= 1, and for a given rT, mu(ess)T decreases with increasing sT to a certain minimum less than 1, and then increases to 1 asymptotically in the limit of large sT. (III) For a fluctuation consisting of multiple Fourier components (i.e., sine wave components), the component with the longest period is the most effective in determining mu(ess) (low pass filter effect). (IV) When the cost c of preventing mutation is positive, the modifier is nonneutral, and mu(ess) becomes larger than in the case of neutral modifier under the same selection pressure acting at the main locus. The value of c which makes mu(ess) equal to mu(op) of the neutral modifier case is calculated. It is argued that this value gives a critical cost such that, so long as the actual cost exceeds this value, the evolution rate at the main locus must be smaller than its mutation rate mu(ess).",W1839838630,False,0.3676334619522095

In this paper, we calculate the probability of fixation of beneficial mutations that occur in populations of changing size. We examine a number of demographic models, including a population whose size changes once, a population experiencing exponential growth or decline, one that is experiencing logistic growth or decline, and a population that fluctuates in size. The results are based on a branching process model but are shown to be approximate solutions to the diffusion equation describing changes in the probability of fixation over time. Using the diffusion equation, the probability of fixation of deleterious alleles can also be determined for populations that are changing in size. The results developed in this paper can be used to estimate the fixation flux, defined as the rate at which beneficial alleles fix within a population. The fixation flux measures the rate of adaptive evolution of a population and, as we shall see, depends strongly on changes that occur in population size.",W1855857669,False,0.7752175331115723

A general method for calculating the fixation probability of an allele that can find itself in a variety of genetic backgrounds is applied to find the effect of substitutions, fluctuating polymorphisms, and deleterious mutations in a large population. With loose linkage, r, the effects depend on the additive genetic variance in relative fitness, var(W), and act by reducing effective population size by (N/Ne) = 1 + var(W)/2r2. However, tightly linked loci can have a substantial effect not predictable from Ne. Linked deleterious mutations reduce the fixation probability of weakly favored alleles by exp (-2U/R), where U is the total mutation rate and R is the map length in Morgans. Substitutions can cause a greater reduction: an allele with advantage s < scrit = (pi 2/6) loge (S/s) [var(W)/R] is very unlikely to be fixed. (S is the advantage of the substitution impeding fixation.) Fluctuating polymorphisms at many (n) linked loci can also have a substantial effect, reducing fixation probability by exp [square root of 2Kn var(W)/R] [K = -1/E((u-u)2/uv) depending on the frequencies (u,v) at the selected polymorphisms].

Both the TL and TSS gal80 mutants are constitutive for galactokinase activity at 35 degrees C and, because they are derived from a dominant super-repressible GAL80s mutant, are uninducible at 25 degrees C. Both the TL and TSS gal4 mutants are galactose negative at 35 degrees C and galactose positive at 25 degrees C. None of the ts gal4 mutations affected the thermolability of galactokinase activity in cell extracts. Induction of galactokinase activity was studied with these mutants. The results indicate that the gal80 gene codes for a repressor and the gal4 gene codes for a positive factor indispensable for the expression of the structural genes or their products. However, striking evidence that the expression of the gal4 gene is constitutive and not under the control of gal80 was provided by a kinetic study with the TL gal4 mutant. The TL gal4 mutant pregrown in glycerol nutrient medium at 35 degrees C showed a prolonged lag period (35 min) in the induction of galactokinase activity at 25 degrees C, whereas the same mutant pregrown at 25 degrees C showed the same lag period as those observed in the wild-type strain and a revertant clone derived from the TL gal4 mutant (15 min).",W1491021136,False,0.016779862344264984

Our purification followed GAL4 activity by its binding to a specific DNA target sequence, using filter binding assays. No specific binding activity was detected in extracts from a strain containing a disrupted copy of the GAL4 gene. The purification protocol included fractionation of a whole cell extract by ion-exchange and DNA-affinity chromatography on a column containing a 17-base pair oligomer encoding a near consensus GAL4 binding site. Two polypeptides co-eluted with the GAL4 DNA binding activity from the DNA-affinity column. One had an apparent molecular mass of 99 kDa (the predicted size of the GAL4 protein) and cross-reacted with antibodies raised against GAL4 epitopes from fusion proteins expressed in bacterial cells. The second polypeptide did not cross-react with the anti-GAL4 antibody and is presumed to be the GAL80 transcriptional repressor based on its size (48 kDa) and known physical association with the GAL4 protein. GAL4 binding activity elutes from a gel filtration column as a 155-kDa species suggesting that it exists in solution in a heterodimer complex of one GAL4 and one GAL80 molecule.

Comparison of wild type chromatin digests to naked DNA digests shows that there are specific regions of these upstream sequences which are strongly protected in chromatin. Comparison to chromatin digests from cells disrupted for the positive regulatory gene, GAL4, or the negative regulatory gene, GAL80, and thus lacking GAL4 or GAL80 function, shows that these regions of protection in wild type chromatin are GAL80-dependent but not GAL4-dependent. The protected regions include DNA lying on (GAL10) or near (GAL1) the respective TATA boxes. These protections are present in both noninduced and induced cells. Both DNA strands are equally protected. Upstream of GAL1 there is a second protected region. This protection shows considerable expression and strand dependence. These observations provide the first evidence that the GAL80 function influences chromatin structure and suggest possible mechanisms by which GAL80 modulates the GAL1 and 10 promoters in induced cells.

Gradualist models of adaptation, which assume that all mutations are small relative to the distance to a fitness optimum, predict that adaptive walks should be longer when the founding genotype is less well adapted. More recent work modeling adaptation as a sequence of moves in phenotype or genotype space predicts, by contrast, much shorter adaptive walks irrespective of the fitness of the founding genotype. Here, we provide what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first direct test of these alternative models, measuring the length of adaptive walks in evolving lineages of fungus that differ initially in fitness. Contrary to the gradualist view, we show that the length of adaptive walks in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans is insensitive to starting fitness and involves just two mutations on average. This arises because poorly adapted populations tend to fix mutations of larger average effect than those of better‐adapted populations. Our results suggest that the length of adaptive walks may be independent of the fitness of the founding genotype and, moreover, that poorly adapted populations can quickly adapt to novel environments.",W1604756962,False,0.4479709565639496

This plant species probably entered Australia in the 1870s. Isolates of the viruses were obtained from N. glauca specimens deposited in the NSW Herbarium between 1899 and 1972, and others were obtained from living plants in 1985 and 1993. It was found that the NSW N. glauca population was infected with tobacco mosaic tobamovirus (TMV) and tobacco mild green mosaic tobamovirus (TMGMV) before 1950 but only with TMGMV after that date. Half the pre-1950 infections were mixtures of the two viruses, and one was a recombinant. Remarkably, sequence analyses showed no increase in the genetic diversity among the TMGMV isolates over the period. However, for TMV, the genetic diversity of synonymous (but not of nonsynonymous) differences between isolates varied and was correlated with their time of isolation. TMV accumulated to smaller concentrations than TMGMV in N. glauca plants, and in mixed experimental infections, the accumulation of TMV, but not of TMGMV, was around 1/10 that in single infections. However, no evidence was found of isolate-specific interaction between the viruses. We conclude that although TMV may have colonized N. glauca in NSW earlier or faster than TMGMV, the latter virus caused a decrease of the TMV population below a threshold at which deleterious mutations were eliminated. This phenomenon, called Muller's ratchet, or a ""mutational meltdown,"" probably caused the disappearance of TMV from the niche.",W1636348072,False,0.8054917454719543

https://doi.org/10.18174/122092,On the evolution of pesticide resistance in Phytophthora infestans : an experimental evolution approach,"Resistance to antimicrobial agents is a serious problem for both medicine and agriculture. The initial success of such toxins is due to absence of resistant genotypes in pathogen populations before treatment. The initial low frequency of resistance may be explained by negative pleiotropic effects of the resistance mutations on fitness in the absence of the toxin. However, when resistant and sensitive natural isolates are compared, no cost of resistance may often be seen. This high fitness of resistant genotypes is explained by the existence of compensatory mutations, i.e. mutations that ameliorate the negative effect of the initial resistance mutation. The accumulation of these compensatory mutations can only occur at a sufficient rate if the population of resistant genotypes is large, which in part depends on the pesticide use. As a result, resistance may be stably maintained in a population after pesticide treatment, whereas it was absent before pesticide treatment. Resistance to the phenylamide pesticide metalaxyl is common in populations of Phytophthora infestans, the oomycete that causes the late blight disease in potato. This resistance evolved within a few years after metalaxyl became commercially available in 1977. Such fast evolution of pesticide resistance may present a serious threat for potato production. However, fast evolution of resistance to other pesticides has not been described in P. infestans, whereas resistance to metalaxyl and other pesticides are common in other oomycetes. In the absence of metalaxyl, resistant isolates of P. infestans have a higher fitness during epidemics compared to sensitive isolates. This observation has led to the assumption that metalaxyl resistance has a direct positive effect on epidemic fitness. A reduction of the survival during the winter has been put forward as an explanation for the absence of resistance before the commercial release of metalaxyl. However, given a high mutation rate towards metalaxyl resistance, a direct positive effect of metalaxyl resistance would always lead to a high frequency of resistance, even in the absence of metalaxyl. In this thesis, we report on an experimental evolution approach to investigate the fast evolution and apparent stability of metalaxyl resistance in P. infestans. We used an experimental evolution procedure because it has several advantages. First, it enables a detailed inspection of the trajectory of evolutionary changes (e.g. in resistance phenotype). Second, it enables comparisons of fitness components between near-isogenic genotypes that only differ in their sensitivity to metalaxyl, whereas conclusions based on comparisons of field isolates and offspring from sexual crosses are hampered by differences in the genetic background. Two experiments were performed to investigate the rate of evolution of resistance to a number of pesticides. First, we used a fluctuation test to estimate the mutation rate towards resistance against metalaxyl, fluazinam and cyazofamid. This fluctuation test, however, was not suitable to estimate the mutation rate in P. infestans, due to background growth of sensitive genotypes for metalaxyl and due to the low amount of zoospores that can be obtained from a single colony for the other two pesticides. Second, we analyzed the response of selection on low pesticide concentrations. Serial transfer of zoospores on a constant low concentration of metalaxyl resulted in full resistance. The same procedure on a low concentration of cyazofamid with a similar effect on growth rate, however, did not result in full resistance. The genotypes that emerged after the selection procedure were compared with the sensitive ancestor with respect to a number of fitness components in the absence of metalaxyl. This approach did not reveal a cost of resistance. On the contrary, resistant genotypes showed a higher in vitro fitness compared to their sensitive ancestor. However, the results from a population survey during a nation-wide ban of metalaxyl containing pesticides in the Netherlands were suggestive of a negative effect of resistance on winter survival and on epidemic fitness. These results suggest that the relative high frequency of metalaxyl resistant isolates on untreated fields can only be explained by assuming that metalaxyl resistance has an initial cost that is followed by compensatory mutations that only restores epidemic fitness. A new selection procedure that included serial transfer of zoospores, revealed a small initial cost on in vitro performance by increasing the lag phase before the start of growth. Subsequent compensatory evolution under the selection conditions could then explain the absence of a cost of resistance in previous experiments. However, no such compensatory evolution was directly observed in this latter selection procedure. The results presented in this thesis suggest that metalaxyl resistance is selected on a wide range of concentrations, whereas this is not the case for (some) other pesticides. This may explain the relative fast evolution of resistance to metalaxyl relative to that for other pesticides. Additionally, the absence of resistance before the commercial release of metalaxyl can be explained by a negative effect due to delaying growth. Finally, the methodology of experimental evolution may be a valuable addition to the multitude of methods used to study the population dynamics of this important pathogen.",W1527264726,False,0.34789493680000305

Phage were evolved by serial transfer at low multiplicity of infection on rapidly dividing bacteria to select genotypes with the fastest rates of reproduction. Both phage showed overall greater fitness effects per substitution during the early stages of adaptation. The fitness of ϕX174 improved from −0.7 to 5.6 doublings of phage concentration per generation. Five missense mutations were observed. The earliest two mutations accounted for 85% of the ultimate fitness gain. In contrast, G4 required adaptation to the intermediate temperature of 41.5° before it could be maintained at 44°. Its fitness at 44° increased from −2.7 to 3.2, nearly the same net gain as in ϕX174, but with three times the opportunity for adaptation. Seventeen mutations were observed in G4: 14 missense, 2 silent, and 1 intergenic. The first 3 missense substitutions accounted for over half the ultimate fitness increase. Although the expected pattern of periodic selective sweeps was the most common one for both phage, some mutations were lost after becoming frequent, and long-term polymorphism was observed. This study provides the greatest detail yet in combining fitness profiles with the underlying pattern of genetic changes, and the results support recent theories on the range of fitness effects of substitutions fixed during adaptation.",W1857653616,False,0.01855369843542576

These alterations can occur simultaneously and/or successively through time, making parasitically modified organisms undoubtedly more complex than traditionally viewed. Here, we briefly review the multidimensionality of host manipulation by parasites, discuss its possible significance and evolution, and propose directions for further research.

We analyze a linearized model for small fluctuations. Employing the standard deviation of a function in a given direction as a measure of scale, the spatial scale of population synchrony, lρ, is related to the spatial scales of environmental correlation, le, and individual dispersal, l, by the simple general formula [Formula: see text], where m is the individual dispersal rate and γ is the strength of population density regulation (or rate of return to equilibrium, [Formula: see text] in the logistic model). Relative to environmental correlation (the Moran effect), the contribution of individual dispersal to the spatial scale of synchrony is magnified by the ratio of the individual dispersal rate to the strength of density regulation. Thus, even if the scale of individual dispersal is smaller than that of environmental correlation, dispersal can substantially increase the scale of population synchrony for weakly regulated populations.",W2019362044,False,0.653892457485199

In this paper, we explore the effect of fragmentation when the fragmentation follows a fractal pattern. The habitat is divided into patches, each of which is suitable or unsuitable. Suitable patches are either occupied or unoccupied, and change state depending on rates of colonization and local extinction. We compare the behaviour of two models: a spatially implicit patch‐occupancy (PO) model and a spatially explicit cellular automaton (CA) model. The PO model has two fixed points: extinction, and a stable equilibrium with a fixed proportion of occupied patches. Global extinction results when habitat destruction reduces the proportion of suitable patches below a critical threshold. The PO model successfully recreates the extinction patterns found in other models. We translated the PO model into a stochastic cellular automaton. Fractal arrangements of suitable and unsuitable patches were used to simulate habitat fragmentation. We found that: (i) a population on a fractal landscape can tolerate more habitat destruction than predicted by the patch‐occupancy model, and (ii) the extinction threshold decreases as the fractal dimension of the landscape decreases. These effects cannot be seen in spatially implicit models.

Over the past 35 years, most attention has focused on relationships involving number (species-area and species-energy relationships) or abundance distributions (broken-stick, geometric, log-normal, core-satellite, etc.). Composition patterns have been underemphasized, even though several tools for addressing particular non-random patterns in species composition are available. One non-random pattern in community composition is nested subset structure. A community has a nested subset structure if the species found in depauperate replicates are also found in progressively more species-rich assemblages. In this review, the problems of failing to consider composition patterns like nestedness are described, using species-area relationships and the SLOSS debate (single large or several small reserves) as an example. In addition, nestedness analyses are promoted as: 1) important descriptive tools for determining whether a community has this common non-random pattern of species composition, and 2) as important investigative tools for suggesting mechanisms potentially structuring a community.",W1967192147,False,0.7998422384262085

This is especially true for those researchers without a formal background in information theory. Here, we highlight a number of practical obstacles to model averaging complex models. Although not meant to be an exhaustive review, we identify several important issues with tentative solutions where they exist (e.g. dealing with collinearity amongst predictors; how to compute model-averaged parameters) and highlight areas for future research where solutions are not clear (e.g. when to use random intercepts or slopes; which information criteria to use when random factors are involved). We also provide a worked example of a mixed model analysis of inbreeding depression in a wild population. By providing an overview of these issues, we hope that this approach will become more accessible to those investigating any process where multiple variables impact an evolutionary or ecological response.",W1584343945,False,0.21764683723449707

The different taxa can breed together and exchange genes but they retain their distinctiveness (although Mus (musculus) molossinus of Japan seems to be the result of a complete fusion between M. (m.) musculus and M. (m.) castaneus). The most widespread form is M. (m.) domesticus, which has successfully colonized every continent as a commensal, albeit with varying contributions from other Mus genomes. It has also been domesticated as the laboratory mouse. This means that the same genome is exposed to a wide variety of environments and gives tremendous opportunities for exploring the operation of different evolutionary mechanisms. Mice have accompanied evolutionary understanding from early Darwinian days – confirming Mendelian ratios and showing they applied in mammals, providing data on rates of evolution, and representing examples of dominance modification, differential survival, competition and other indicators of a struggle for existence. However, they have an unfulfilled potential to drive as well as to illuminate evolutionary theory – by revealing more about, for example, the interactions between gene flow and social determinants, constraints on introgression and physiological adjustments. This potential can be explored through our ever-deepening knowledge of the genome and molecular mechanisms, and by the application of new techniques, but its most effective agent will always be the cross-disciplinary synergy of visionary scientists like Julian Huxley, Charles Elton and Louis Thaler.",W1529516420,False,0.021832197904586792

https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01302.x,A call for statistical pluralism answered,"We welcome Lukacs et al.'s (2007) response to our paper calling for pluralism in inferential approaches. These are important issues and we sought to clarify the strengths and weaknesses of two inferential approaches in an atmosphere that avoided denigrating either, while emphasizing that poor application of any statistical approach is a weak basis for disregarding it as a tool for science. Lukacs et al.'s (2007) contribution is helpful, clarifying the arguments in favour of information theoretic (IT) approaches. The single-parameter example is useful and does much to illustrate the application of the approach. In general, we applaud statistical formalization of the method of multiple working hypotheses, as well as the focus on acknowledging model selection uncertainty, which we see as a principal advantage of that method. In spite of our broad concurrence with Lukacs et al. (2007), it is unsurprising that areas of disagreement remain. Here, we focus on four. First, we question their apparent view that arguments regarding null hypothesis testing (NHT) and IT are widely understood, and that confusion over statistical methods is dissipating. Second, we believe that, whether or not it is the best method for a given problem, NHT can represent a far richer approach to analysis than represented by Lukacs et al. (2007). We clarify why this is the case. Third, we are concerned that, by denigrating the statistical theory underlying NHT as relatively weak, Lukacs et al. (2007) overstate the degree to which elements of their suggested IT algorithms are established, and their performance known. Last, in disparaging exploratory data analysis (EDA), Lukacs et al. (2007) confuse different stages of scientific endeavour. We explain what we see as the purpose of EDA and its role in science. Lukacs et al. (2007) take a positive view of statistics in ecology and see confusion over statistical methods 'dissipating'. Although we would like to be equally optimistic, this is not yet our perception. Whittingham et al. (2006) surveyed articles published in 2004 in three leading ecological journals, and assessed approaches to multiple regression analyses (an analytical approach widely associated with the application of IT methods). They found that NHT approaches were used more than three times as often as approaches based on IT (Whittingham et al. 2006). More strikingly, they also found that, of the relatively small number of cases where IT approaches were used, the majority used IT as part of an automated, stepwise procedure. This is in sharp contrast to the recommendations of Burnham & Anderson (2002), and serves as a reminder that IT does not inherently motivate the rigorous development of biologically plausible candidate models. Hobbs & Hilborn (2006) assessed statistical methods used in literature published by the Ecological Society of America. From 1984 to 2003, they found little change in the frequency with which NHT methods had been used. In the same period, the number of articles that include the words 'Bayesian', 'model selection' or 'likelihood' in their text increased, but evidence of an upward trend since 1996 is lacking (Hobbs & Hilborn 2006). Our own assessment of recent issues of four ecological and evolutionary journals showed that, overall, NHT techniques were used in at least 90% of data-based papers, while IT techniques were used in less than 10% (Stephens et al. in press). Clearly, the widespread adoption of new methods, even those that have been vigorously promoted, takes time. Nevertheless, these data suggest that we must beware of complacency; statistical approaches remain a source of uncertainty and disagreement. Given prevailing practices among ecologists in a position to mentor students, novice practitioners of ecology, in particular, may be confused by the inferential options available to them. Our second concern regarding Lukacs et al. (2007) relates to their characterization of the process of NHT. In our original paper, we argued both that null hypotheses should often be framed more imaginatively than 'no effect', and that the interpretation of NHT can be improved (Stephens et al. 2005). By caricaturing NHT as a process of using 'an arbitrary α level and the resulting P-value' to assess a default null (of 'no effect'), Lukacs et al. (2007) overlooked a substantial part of our original arguments. Those arguments can be aptly restated with reference to their dipper Cinclus cinclus example. Using that example, Lukacs et al. (2007) show that IT can be used to compare evidence ratios for different models regarding the survival of the dipper in flood and non-flood years. They also demonstrate that uncertainty in model selection can be incorporated in parameter estimates using multimodel averaging. In spite of this, the primary outcome of the IT approach is the ability to state that, 'Given the available data, a difference in survival probability having occurred between normal and flood years is 10·52 times more likely than no difference having occurred'. We concede that the authors may have used a highly simplistic example for illustrative purposes. However, given the authors' recurrent criticisms of trivial or implausible nulls (e.g. Anderson et al. 2000), demonstrating the application of IT with a question framed as a 'silly null' seems counter-productive. By contrast, in our paper (Stephens et al. 2005), we argued for a stronger emphasis on critical forethought. In particular, we argued that the null should be framed in terms of a predetermined, consequential difference, and that the choice of α-level should be motivated by considerations of the trade-off between the consequences of Type I and Type II errors for the particular situation. These considerations should take place prior to analysis, and must be informed by the biology of the situation and the context of the analysis (e.g. management or research). Such a process would permit stronger inferences regarding the biological significance of the data, rather than only their implications for the statistical models considered. Some (e.g. Link & Barker 2006) have interpreted our original paper (Stephens et al. 2005) to suggest that we are resistant to model averaging. This is not the case. Rather, we believe that model averaging is an important and valuable process, but one that requires further investigation before it can be applied with confidence in every area. Until the widespread application of the process is well understood, we would be cautious about proselytizing about any one approach with too much zeal. Related to this, our third concern arises from Lukacs et al.'s (2007) assertion that 'the theory underlying NHT is weak'. By implication, the theory underlying the inferential procedures that they recommend (model formulation, model selection and model averaging) is strong and well-established. Other sources, by contrast, suggest that certain aspects of the model comparison process are, as yet, relatively poorly understood. For example, Akaike's information criterion (AIC) is only one possible information criterion that could be used for model selection and statisticians remain divided over which of the possible criteria is most suitable in a given set of circumstances (Kass & Raftery 1995; Guthery et al. 2005; Link & Barker 2006). Where AIC is used, rules of thumb for interpreting Δi (differences in AIC values for competing models) are also unclear in some cases (Burnham & Anderson 2002: 71), while the performance of AICc (AIC values corrected for small sample sizes) is also debatable (Richards 2005). In addition, more work on when and how to apply AIC-derived model weights to model averaging is likely to be necessary before this technique can be applied with confidence (Buckland et al. 1997; Burnham & Anderson 2002: 152–3; Richards 2005). One area ripe for rapid improvement is the development of clear, consistent approaches to describe AIC-based algorithms. For example, Lukacs et al. (2007) appear to use 'model weight', 'model probability' and 'model likelihood' synonymously. Although there may be valid reasons for doing so, such varied terminology is likely to contribute to confusion surrounding emerging methods. Finally, we find it curious that Lukacs et al. (2007) regard EDA as a 'risky method for developing scientific hypotheses' and imply that rigorous application of EDA fails to involve focusing 'substantial mental effort to derive a set of plausible scientific hypotheses'. We suggest that Lukacs et al. (2007) are conflating EDA as an aid to devise new hypotheses with that of a tool to test them. EDA cannot be used to test hypotheses. At its most basic level, however, science is the process of observing patterns, developing hypotheses to explain those patterns, and testing those hypotheses. We contend that EDA plays a strong role in pattern recognition and, hence, is an important tool of hypothesis generation. As Sir Peter Medawar observed, the source of scientific hypotheses is the human imagination and all that aids it (e.g. Medawar 1996). EDA is one of the powerful aids to our scientific imagination and curtailing its use would be counterproductive and stifling. Science is an iterative process, in which existing models can often be improved upon. EDA often indicates how a model must be modified for further testing. Of course, the results of a priori analyses and the hypotheses that result from EDA must be kept separate. Indeed, most scientific publications report in 'Results' the outcome of a priori analyses (often with the use of very simple descriptive statistics) and, in their 'Discussion', pose the hypotheses generated by EDA. Often EDA forms the observational foundation for the 'hard thinking' advocated by Lukacs et al. (2006). In his paper on the method of multiple working hypotheses, T. C. Chamberlin supported a diverse approach to tackle scientific questions. Of the working hypothesis approach he stated, 'This has been affirmed to be the scientific method. But it is rash to assume than any method is the method, or at least that it is the ultimate method' (italics in the original; Chamberlin 1890, in Hilborn & Mangel 1997: 286). Our original paper also called for the acceptance of different approaches, recognizing that inferential statistics are tools, and that no current inferential toolbox holds all the tools needed by ecologists. We are pleased that, in spite of their strong preference for IT methods, Lukacs et al. (2007) seem to have endorsed pluralism. We hope that this exchange will stimulate discussion among ecologists and statisticians about how inference is best conducted, and help to reduce the confusion that remains within the field of ecological statistics.",W1577763416,False,0.8493144512176514
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2006.01141.x,Why do we still use stepwise modelling in ecology and behaviour?,"Summary The biases and shortcomings of stepwise multiple regression are well established within the statistical literature. However, an examination of papers published in 2004 by three leading ecological and behavioural journals suggested that the use of this technique remains widespread: of 65 papers in which a multiple regression approach was used, 57% of studies used a stepwise procedure. The principal drawbacks of stepwise multiple regression include bias in parameter estimation, inconsistencies among model selection algorithms, an inherent (but often overlooked) problem of multiple hypothesis testing, and an inappropriate focus or reliance on a single best model. We discuss each of these issues with examples. We use a worked example of data on yellowhammer distribution collected over 4 years to highlight the pitfalls of stepwise regression. We show that stepwise regression allows models containing significant predictors to be obtained from each year's data. In spite of the significance of the selected models, they vary substantially between years and suggest patterns that are at odds with those determined by analysing the full, 4‐year data set. An information theoretic (IT) analysis of the yellowhammer data set illustrates why the varying outcomes of stepwise analyses arise. In particular, the IT approach identifies large numbers of competing models that could describe the data equally well, showing that no one model should be relied upon for inference.",W1599304806,False,0.0017126648453995585

Here, we consider how the waiting time until the first split and its location depend on different evolutionary factors including mutation, migration, random genetic drift, genetic architecture, and the geometric structure of the habitat. We perform large-scale, individual-based simulations using a simple model of reproductive isolation based on a classical view that reproductive isolation evolves as a by-product of genetic divergence. We show that rapid parapatric speciation on the time scale of a few hundred to a few thousand generations is plausible even when neighboring subpopulations exchange several individuals each generation. Divergent selection for local adaptation is not required for rapid speciation. Our results substantiates the claims that species with smaller range sizes (which are characterized by smaller local densities and reduced dispersal ability) should have higher speciation rates. If mutation rate is small, local abundances are low, or substantial genetic changes are required for reproductive isolation, then central populations should be the place where most splits take place. With high mutation rates, high local densities, or with moderate genetic changes sufficient for reproductive isolation, speciation events are expected to involve mainly peripheral populations.",W1975628220,False,0.7272130250930786

If the phylogeny of these species is known, then the mean phenotypes of taxa can be partitioned into heritable phylogenetic effects and nonheritable residual components. Methods are presented for the estimation of phylogenywide means of characters, the variance-covariance structure of the components of taxon-specific means, and the mean phenotypes of ancestral taxa. These methods, which are largely an extension of maximum-likelihood techniques used in quantitative genetics, make an efficient use of the data, are unbiased by phylogenetically uninformative contributions to mean phenotypes, and take into account fully the nonindependence of data resulting from evolutionary relationships. Statistical tests are introduced for evaluating the significance of phylogenetic heritability and of correlations between traits, and expressions are given for the standard errors of ancestral mean phenotype estimates. It is argued that the covariance structure of phylogenetic effects provides a description of a macroevolutionary pattern, whereas that for the residual effects, when corrected for sampling error, is more closely related to a microevolutionary pattern.",W1994704190,False,0.136015847325325

A previous study indicated that M. demolitor polydnavirus (MdPDV) infects primarily hemocytes in parasitized hosts. Thereafter, several alterations that compromise the immune response of P. includens toward the developing parasitoid occur in hemocytes. In this study, we identified two MdPDV mRNAs (1.0 and 1.5 kb) expressed in P. includens hemocytes that have homology to the viral genomic clone pMd-2. Corresponding 1.0- and 1.5-kb cDNA clones (MdPi455 and MdPi59) were isolated from an MdPDV-infected hemocyte cDNA library. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cDNA clones confirmed that the 1.5- and 1.0-kb mRNAs have significant regions of homology. Sequence alignment revealed that the gene, OMd1.0, encoding the 1.0-kb mRNA is present in pMd-2. This gene contains two introns and three exons that agree with the sequence for MdPi455. In contrast, the 1.5-kb mRNA is likely encoded by a related gene located on the same MdPDV genomic DNA as is OMd1.0. The predicted peptide sequences for the 1.0- and 1.5-kb transcripts contain a cysteine-rich region at their 5' ends that have some similarity with epidermal growth factor-like motifs.

Characterization of genes disrupting insect physiological systems is a major objective in the study of polydnaviruses. Recently, a cysteine-rich gene family encoding a motif composed of invariable cysteine residues flanking hypervariable intercysteine amino acids was described (S.D. Dib-Hajj, B.A. Webb, and M.D. Summers, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:3765-3769, 1993). They noted similarities to the positive selection pressure for mutations within the vertebrate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes and speculated that this class of polydnavirus genes may target and disrupt the insect immune system. To study the functional activity of this family of predicted cysteine-rich proteins, the VHv1.1 gene product was produced from bacterial and baculovirus expression systems. Polyclonal antiserum produced from the bacterial fusion protein reacted with a 30-kDa protein from hemocytes, cell-free plasma, and fat body of parasitized larvae. Immunofluorescence analysis of hemocytes from parasitized insects detected the 30-kDa protein bound to granulocytes and plasmacytes. To assay the functional activity of the 30-kDa VHv1.1 protein, a recombinant baculovirus was constructed allowing in vivo expression of the 30-kDa polydnavirus protein from infected insects. Expression of the VHv1.1 protein from the baculovirus system reduced the encapsulation response to washed wasp eggs relative to controls. The experimental evidence demonstrates that Campoletis sonorensis polydnavirus-infected cells secrete VHv1.1 into the hemolymph, where it binds to hemocytes and is associated with the inhibition of the cellular immune response.",W1517473599,False,0.23605655133724213

A Southern cross-blot hybridization analysis showed that the majority of CsV Eco RI restriction fragments cross-hybridize to multiple Eco RI fragments. These sequence homologies were analyzed by hybridizing recombinant clones of the CsV SH DNAs B, H, M, and O 1 to Southern blots of undigested CsV DNA, using different hybridization stringencies. The results indicated that homologous regions among the SH DNAs include closely related sequences that are detectable under stringent conditions and related but more diverged sequences which are only detectable under reduced stringencies. A sequence that hybridized to the majority of the CsV SH DNAs was identified and subcloned from the SH DNAs O 1, H, and B. Nucleotide sequence data revealed that these homologous regions contained a family of imperfectly conserved repeated elements. These repeat elements were arranged singly or in direct tandem arrays and had an average length of 540 base pairs.

The first feeding experiment was conducted for 15 days using three types of diet: control diet (laboratory chow for mice), acorns of Quercus serrata (QS), and acorns of Q. mongolica var. grosseserrata (QM), which differ in tannin content (control, tannin free; QS, 2.7% tannic acid equivalent; QM, 8.5%). Six and one of eight mice died in the QM and QS groups, respectively, whereas all mice survived in good health in the control group. Body weight in the QM and QS groups decreased as much as 23.6% and 16.8% in the first 5 days, respectively, whereas that in the control group did not change significantly. Dry matter intake in the QM group was 50.0% and 38.7% less than that in the control and QS, respectively. Apparent dry matter digestibility was not different among the diets, but apparent nitrogen digestibility did differ between the two acorn groups (QM, −17.5%; QS, 12.0%). The logistic regression analyses revealed that the survival of mice was synergistically influenced by both dry matter intake and apparent nitrogen digestibility. In the second experiment, wood mice fed the tannin‐free formula diet, which is nutritionally matched to QS and QM acorns except for the tannin, did not suffer antinutritional effects, whereas mice fed the tannin‐supplemented formula diets suffered body weight loss and negative nitrogen digestibility. These results indicate that the tannins in acorns could cause serious damage to the wood mouse, which may rely on acorns as a usual diet.

However, the degree to which foraging investments and seed traits correlate with phylogenetic relationships among trees remains unexplored. We presented seeds of 23 different hardwood tree species (families Betulaceae, Fagaceae, Juglandaceae) to eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), and measured the time and distance travelled by squirrels that consumed or cached each seed. We estimated 11 physical and chemical seed traits for each species, and the phylogenetic relationships between the 23 hardwood trees. Variance partitioning revealed that considerable variation in foraging investment was attributable to seed traits alone (27–73%), and combined effects of seed traits and phylogeny of hardwood trees (5–55%). A phylogenetic PCA (pPCA) on seed traits and tree phylogeny resulted in 2 ""global"" axes of traits that were phylogenetically autocorrelated at the family and genus level and a third ""local"" axis in which traits were not phylogenetically autocorrelated. Collectively, these axes explained 30–76% of the variation in squirrel foraging investments. The first global pPCA axis, which produced large scores for seed species with thin shells, low lipid and high carbohydrate content, was negatively related to time to consume and cache seeds and travel distance to cache. The second global pPCA axis, which produced large scores for seeds with high protein, low tannin and low dormancy levels, was an important predictor of consumption time only. The local pPCA axis primarily reflected kernel mass. Although it explained only 12% of the variation in trait space and was not autocorrelated among phylogenetic clades, the local axis was related to all four squirrel foraging investments. Squirrel foraging behaviors are influenced by a combination of phylogenetically conserved and more evolutionarily labile seed traits that is consistent with a weak or more diffuse coevolutionary relationship between rodents and hardwood trees rather than a direct coevolutionary relationship.",W1948085964,False,0.8815221786499023

Here, we proposed an approach called phylogenetic signal‐representation (PSR) curve, built upon phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR). In PVR, selected eigenvectors extracted from a phylogenetic distance matrix are used to model interspecific variation. In the PSR curve, sequential PVR models are fitted after successively increasing the number of eigenvectors and plotting their R2 against the accumulated eigenvalues. We used simulations to show that a linear PSR curve is expected under Brownian motion and that its shape changes under alternative evolutionary models. The PSR area, expressing deviations from Brownian motion, is strongly correlated (r= 0.873; P < 0.01) with Blomberg's K‐statistics, so nonlinear PSR curves reveal if traits are evolving at a slower or higher rate than expected by Brownian motion. The PSR area is also correlated with phylogenetic half‐life under an Ornstein‐Uhlenbeck process, suggesting how both methods describe the shape of the relationship between interspecific variation and time since divergence among species. The PSR curve provides an elegant exploratory method to understand deviations from Brownian motion, in terms of acceleration or deceleration of evolutionary rates occurring at large or small phylogenetic distances.",W1500335543,False,0.5984663367271423

Captive eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) were fed 100% red oak (Quercus rubra) or white oak (Quercus alba) acorn diets to determine effects on intake, digestion, and detoxification activity. Red oak acorns had higher phenol and tannin levels, which may explain the lower dry matter intakes and apparent protein digestibilities and the higher glucuronidation activities observed in squirrels. Although the white oak acorn diet had lower apparent protein digestibilities than the reference diet, it did not suppress dry matter intake for a prolonged period or stimulate glucuronidation. Negative physiological effects of a 100% red oak acorn diet suggest gray squirrels may require other foods to dilute tannin intake and provide additional nutrients. To distinguish the roles of different tannin types in the observed effects of acorn diets on squirrels, squirrels were fed rat chow containing no tannins, 4% or 8% tannic acid (hydrolyzable tannin), or 3% or 6% quebracho (condensed tannin). Apparent protein digestibilities were reduced by tannic acid and quebracho diets. Only the 8% tannic acid diet tended to increase glucuronidation.

We used spatial proximity, phylogenetic relationship and environmental variables together with phylogenetic eigenvector regression and spatial eigenvector filters to model and predict threat status. Results Our full models explained between 57% and 96% of the variance in extinction risk. Phylogeny and spatial proximity roughly explained between 21% and 70% of the total variation in all analyses, while the explanatory power of environmental conditions was relatively weaker (up to 15%). Phylogeny and spatial proximity contributed equally to the explained variance in the lower threat level, while spatial proximity was the most important factor in the models of the higher threat level. Prediction of threat status achieved 97% correct assignments.

The models for soil strength and root growth varied with soil type, soil depth, and/or clay content. The soils used were a Miles fine sandy loam, Udic Paleustalf and an Abilene clay loam, Pachic Argiustoll. Soil strength for both soils studied and at all depths was influenced by bulk density, voids, and clay content. The overall equational models accounted for 75% of the variability in soil strength and 76% of the variability in root growth. Root growth in both soils and at all depths was significantly influenced by soil strength, volumetric water content, voids, and clay content. The critical strength in bars, defined as the probe pressure at which root elongation stopped, was a function of % clay. The critical strength ranged from 60 to 70 bars in coarsetextured to 25 bars in clay soils. These data provide a better understanding of the influence of mechanical impedance on root growth, and a basis for determining the need for use of deep tillage to minimize the adverse effects of excessive soil strength or compaction.",W1967953229,False,0.00864135380834341

First, plant roots and soil microbes have a long history of interaction that is centered on the reciprocal acquisition of carbon by microbes and nitrogen by plants. Predators within the rhizosphere alter these interactions in ways that benefit plants but also influence the dynamics of other species within ecosystems and processes that are important to ecosystem function and stability. These same predators regulate their prey in a traditional ""top-down"" manner but in doing so alter the release of nutrients that may limit plant productivity and thereby affect plant growth in a ""bottom-up"" fashion as well. Second, much attention has been given to the importance of specific interactions, or, as presented within this series, genes and/or gene products as critical control points. We suggest that control should be viewed within the framework of interactivity. The interdependence between the aboveground and belowground realms can be explained in terms of the patterning of trophic interactions within the rhizosphere and the influence of these interactions on the supply of nutrients and rates of nutrient uptake by plants. While specific interactions may be important, it is the patterning of these interactions into assemblages of species that share similar growth rates and habitats that is the salient feature of the rhizosphere that confers stability, affects nutrient retention, and regulates aboveground and belowground dynamics.

Both the dynamics as well as the outcome of particular herbivore–natural enemy interactions may vary with the herbivore's host plant species, or genotype within species, and understanding such variation is central to the study of tritrophic interactions. The theory of tritrophic interactions implies that plant characteristics that enhance the success of the natural enemies have evolved; plants with traits that encourage the success of natural enemies should have a selective advantage over plants that do not, thus the trait should spread through the plant population (Price et al., 1980; Fritz, 1992, 1995; Hare, 1992).

Yet individually and collectively, these hypotheses fail to address the simultaneous influence of all three factors. Here we review existing hypotheses, and propose the tri-trophic interactions (TTI) hypothesis to consolidate and integrate their predictions. The TTI hypothesis predicts that dietary specialist herbivores (as compared to generalists) should escape predators and be competitively dominant due to faster growth rates, and that such differences should be greater on low quality (as compared to high quality) host plants. To provide a preliminary test of these predictions, we conducted an empirical study comparing the effects of plant (Baccharis salicifolia) quality and predators between a specialist (Uroleucon macolai) and a generalist (Aphis gossypii) aphid herbivore. Consistent with predictions, these three factors interactively determine herbivore performance in ways not addressed by existing hypotheses. Compared to the specialist, the generalist was less fecund, competitively inferior, and more sensitive to low plant quality. Correspondingly, predator effects were contingent upon plant quality only for the generalist. Contrary to predictions, predator effects were weaker for the generalist and on low-quality plants, likely due to density-dependent benefits provided to the generalist by mutualist ants. Because the TTI hypothesis predicts the superior performance of specialists, mutualist ants may be critical to A. gossypii persistence under competition from U. macolai. In summary, the integrative nature of the TTI hypothesis offers novel insight into the determinants of plant-herbivore and herbivore-predator interactions and the coexistence of specialist and generalist herbivores.",W1964435385,False,0.8775317668914795

The butterfly phylogeny was assembled from various sources and host plant clades were identified according to Chase et al.'s rbcL-based phylogeny. The ancestral host plant appears to be associated within a highly derived rosid clade, including the family Fabaceae. As fossil data suggest that this clade is older than the butterflies, they must have colonized already diversified plants. Previous studies also suggest that the patterns of association in most insect-plant interactions are more shaped by host shifts, through colonization and specialization, than by cospeciation. Consequently, we have focused explicitly on the mechanisms behind host shifts. Our results confirm, in the light of new phylogenetic evidence, the pattern reported by Ehrlich and Raven that related butterflies feed on related plants. We show that host shifts have generally been more common between closely related plants than between more distantly related plants. This finding, together with the possibility of a higher tendency of recolonizing ancestral hosts, helps to explain the apparent large-scale conservation in the patterns of association between insects and their host plants, patterns which at the same time are more flexible on a more detailed level. Plant growth form was an even more conservative aspect of the interaction between butterflies and their host plants than plant phylogeny. However, this is largely explained by a higher probability of colonizations and host shifts while feeding on trees than on other growth forms.",W1971509985,False,0.8413461446762085

It is possible that this may be explained, at least in part, by the direct or indirect effect of parasites on reproductive behaviours and the production of secondary sexual characters. This, in tum, has raised interest in possible mechanisms behind parasite mediated sexual selection. Testosterone, the steroid hormone, has been shown to play an important role in regulating aggression, nuptial display, and secondary sexual characters in vertebrates. The finding that parasites can differentially affect secondary sex characters more than other morphological characters (Zuk et al. 1990a) bas added weight to the suggestion that parasitism may alter, directly or indirectly, the levels of hormones, such as testosterone, that regulate the expression of some secondary sex characters.",W1591433538,False,0.280089795589447

https://doi.org/10.1086/422893,Behavioral Syndromes: An Integrative Overview,"A behavioral syndrome is a suite of correlated behaviors expressed either within a given behavioral context (e.g., correlations between foraging behaviors in different habitats) or across different contexts (e.g., correlations among feeding, antipredator, mating, aggressive, and dispersal behaviors). For example, some individuals (and genotypes) might be generally more aggressive, more active or bold, while others are generally less aggressive, active or bold. This phenomenon has been studied in detail in humans, some primates, laboratory rodents, and some domesticated animals, but has rarely been studied in other organisms, and rarely examined from an evolutionary or ecological perspective. Here, we present an integrative overview on the potential importance of behavioral syndromes in evolution and ecology. A central idea is that behavioral correlations generate tradeoffs; for example, an aggressive genotype might do well in situations where high aggression is favored, but might be inappropriately aggressive in situations where low aggression is favored (and vice versa for a low aggression genotype). Behavioral syndromes can thereby result in maladaptive behavior in some contexts, and potentially maintain individual variation in behavior in a variable environment. We suggest terminology and methods for studying behavioral syndromes, review examples, discuss evolutionary and proximate approaches for understanding behavioral syndromes, note insights from human personality research, and outline some potentially important ecological implications. Overall, we suggest that behavioral syndromes could play a useful role as an integrative bridge between genetics, experience, neuroendocrine mechanisms, evolution, and ecology.",W2097789622,False,0.02789563499391079

,The relationship between ocular dimensions and refraction with adult stature: the Tanjong Pagar Survey.,"To describe the association of ocular dimensions and refraction with adult stature.This was a population-based cross-sectional survey of adult Chinese aged 40 to 81 years residing in the Tanjong Pagar district in SINGAPORE: As part of the examination, ocular dimensions, including axial length, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, and vitreous chamber depth, were measured using an A-mode ultrasound device. Corneal radius and refraction were determined with an autorefractor, with refraction further refined subjectively. Height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms) were measured using a standardized protocol, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight divided by the square of the height (kilograms per square meter).Data on ocular biometry, refraction, height, and weight were available on 951 (55.4%) participants with phakic eyes. After controlling for age, sex, education, occupation, housing type, income, and weight, it was found that taller persons were more likely to have longer axial lengths (+0.23 mm longer axial length, for every 0.10 m difference in height), deeper anterior chambers (+0.07 mm), thinner lenses (-0.09 mm), longer vitreous chambers (+0.26 mm), and flatter corneas (+0.09 mm longer corneal radius), although refractions were similar. In contrast, heavier persons tended to have more hyperopic refractions (+0.22 D for every 10 kg difference in weight, +0.56 D for every 10 kg/m(2) difference in BMI) but similar ocular dimensions.Adult height is independently related to ocular dimensions, but does not appear to influence refraction. Thus, although taller persons are more likely to have longer globes, they also tend to have deeper anterior chambers, thinner lenses, and flatter corneas. Conversely, weight is independently related to refraction, although the exact biometric component responsible for this association is not apparent.",W103740680,False,0.002720689633861184

A recent study showed that mice co-infected with Schistosoma mansoni and Plasmodium chabaudi develop higher P. chabaudi parasitaemia and had a higher mortality rate. This important observation deserved to be further investigated among human populations. Malaria attacks were recorded in 512 children aged 6–15 years living in Richard Toll (Northern Senegal) among whom 336 were infected by S. mansoni, and 175 were not. The incidence rate of malaria attacks was significantly higher among S. mansoni-infected individuals, particularly those carrying the highest worm loads, as compared to uninfected subjects (26.6% versus 16,4 %). In contrast, the rate of malaria attacks was lower, without reaching significance, in medium grade S. mansoni infections. Thus, infection by S. mansoni affects susceptibility to malaria, but this can vary according to the intensity of parasite load.

Preliminary data showing enhanced interleukin-5 (IL-5) production by T cells from infected mice and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) synthesis by cells from vaccinated animals (7), suggested differential CD4+ subset stimulation by the different parasite stimuli. To confirm this hypothesis, lymphocytes from vaccinated or infected animals were compared for their ability to produce IFN-gamma and IL-2 (secreted by Th1 cells) as compared with IL-4 and IL-5 (characteristic Th2 cytokines). After stimulation with specific antigen or mitogen, T cells from vaccinated mice or prepatently infected animals responded primarily with Th1 lymphokines, whereas lymphocytes from patently infected mice instead produced Th2 cytokines. The Th2 response in infected animals was shown to be induced by schistosome eggs and directed largely against egg antigens, whereas the Th1 reactivity in vaccinated mice was triggered primarily by larval antigens. Interestingly, Th1 responses in mice carrying egg-producing infections were found to be profoundly downregulated. Moreover, the injection of eggs into vaccinated mice resulted in a reduction of antigen and mitogen-stimulated Th1 function accompanied by a coincident expression of Th2 responses. Together, the data suggest that coincident with the induction of Th2 responses, murine schistosome infection results in an inhibition of potentially protective Th1 function. This previously unrecognized downregulation of Th1 cytokine production may be an important immunological consequence of helminth infection related to host adaptation.",W1965366343,False,0.02751890942454338

For this case, the marginal posterior distribution of the regression coefficient vector for any equation is shown to be of the multivariate-t form. Further, the variances and covariances of the error terms have an “inverted” Wishart distribution a posteriori. Some properties of this distribution are given.

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.",W2020999234,False,0.011980040930211544

https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.1988.0002,Population dynamics and biological control,"Using simple models for host-parasitoid and host-pathogen interactions, we present a basic framework for examining the outcome of releasing natural enemies against a target pest population in a classical biological control programme. In particular, we examine the conditions for the initial invasion and establishment of a natural enemy species, for the maximum depression of the host population, and for the persistence of the populations in a stable interaction. In these conditions there are close parallels between parasitoids and pathogens. The practice of augmenting an existing natural enemy population by regular mass releases has been widely practised, especially with parasitoids. The conditions for eradication of the pest are very similar in host-parasitoid and host-pathogen models, namely that releases must be greater than the equilibrium production of natural enemies in the absence of releases. Any additional density dependence acting on the host population after the stage attacked by parasitoids can influence the effectiveness of augmentative releases. This is particularly the case with over-compensating density dependence when additional releases can actually lead to an increase in the host population. A theoretical basis for biological control cannot be properly developed simply by considering the dynamics of releasing single natural enemy species. Biological control often involves the interplay among different types of natural enemies affecting the same host population. As a step in the direction of producing more complex, multispecies models, we examine the dynamics of three situations: (1) where the host is attacked by two parasitoid species; (2) by a generalist predator and a specialist parasitoid; or (3) by a parasitoid and a pathogen. The dynamics of these three-species systems can be complex, and with properties not easily foreseen from the separate pairwise interactions. These results caution us against formulating biological control strategies purely in terms of two-species systems. For the main part we examine host-parasitoid interactions with discrete, synchronized generations. These would appear to be less suitable to tropical insects where continuous generations and life cycles of the host and parasitoid of different length are to be expected. We show, however, that cycles (with a period of one host generation) can be obtained from an age-structured simulation model, and that these are promoted by the parasitoids having a life cycle half as long as that of the host. Some implications for biological control are discussed. Finally, we turn briefly to the dynamics of host-parasitoid and host-pathogen interactions where pesticides are also applied, and we discuss the evolution of pesticide resistance within the context of these models.",W1614079712,False,0.7849567532539368

To address this question, genetic and morphological differentiation were studied at two spatial scales (range 2–13 km and range 300 m to 2 km) in the perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) from the east coast archipelago of Sweden, using seven microsatellite loci and geometric morphometrics. We found highly significant genetic differentiation between sampled locations at both scales. At the larger spatial scale, the distance per se was not affecting the level of divergence. At the small scale, however, we found subtle patterns of isolation by distance. In addition, we also found morphological divergence between locations, congruent with a spatial separation at a microgeographic scale, most likely due to phenotypic plasticity. The present study highlights the importance of geographical scale and indicates that there might be a disparity between the dispersal capacity of a species and the actual movement of genes. Thus, how we view the environment and possible barriers to dispersal might have great implications for our ability to fully understand the evolution of genetic differentiation, local adaptation, and, in the end, speciation.",W1775741543,False,0.8239538669586182

The organization of this region is similar to that of other vertebrates. A tandem array of 10-bp repeats, associated with length variation and heteroplasmy was observed in the 5′ end. While the location of the array corresponds to that reported in other species, the length of the repeated unit is shorter than previously observed for tandem repeats in this region. The repeated sequence was highly similar to the Mt5 element which has been shown to specifically bind a putative D-loop DNA termination protein. Of 149 perch analyzed, 74% showed length variation heteroplasmy. Single-cell PCR on oocytes suggested that the high level of heteroplasmy is passively maintained by maternal transmission. The array was also observed in the two other percid species, ruffe (Acerina cernua) and zander (Stizostedion lucioperca). The array and the associated length variation heteroplasmy are therefore likely to be general features of percid mtDNAs. Among the perch repeats, the mutation pattern is consistent with unidirectional slippage, and statistical analyses supported the notion that the various haplotypes are associated with different levels of heteroplasmy. The variation in array length among and within species is ascribed to differences in predicted stability of secondary structures made between repeat units.",W1856902180,False,0.5258364081382751
https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/132.2.619,A cladistic analysis of phenotypic associations with haplotypes inferred from restriction endonuclease mapping and DNA sequence data. III. Cladogram estimation.,"Abstract We previously developed a cladistic approach to identify subsets of haplotypes defined by restriction endonuclease mapping or DNA sequencing that are associated with significant phenotypic deviations. Our approach was limited to segments of DNA in which little recombination occurs. In such cases, a cladogram can be constructed from the restriction site or sequence data that represents the evolutionary steps that interrelate the observed haplotypes. The cladogram is used to define a nested statistical design to identify mutational steps associated with significant phenotypic deviations. The central assumption behind this strategy is that any undetected mutation causing a phenotypic effect is embedded within the same evolutionary history that is represented by the cladogram. The power of this approach depends upon the confidence one has in the particular cladogram used to draw inferences. In this paper, we present a strategy for estimating the set of cladograms that are consistent with a particular sample of either restriction site or nucleotide sequence data and that includes the possibility of recombination. We first evaluate the limits of parsimony in constructing cladograms. Once these limits have been determined, we construct the set of parsimonious and nonparsimonious cladograms that is consistent with these limits. Our estimation procedure also identifies haplotypes that are candidates for being products of recombination. If recombination is extensive, our algorithm subdivides the DNA region into two or more subsections, each having little or no internal recombination. We apply this estimation procedure to three data sets to illustrate varying degrees of cladogram ambiguity and recombination.",W1901627773,False,0.15739311277866364

Although attempts to classify the stages in the process of species formation date back at least as far as Alfred Russel Wallace, one of the most intense debates on the subject occurred among botanists during the mid-20th Century. The present review outlines the progression of the historical debate about stages in the evolution of species, which was instigated by the genecological classification scheme of Göte Turesson in the 1920s, championed in the mid-century by Jens Clausen, and then brought under harsh scrutiny by many in the 1960s and 1970s. At the heart of the controversy is the question of whether speciation occurs rapidly on a local scale or gradually through the formation of geographically widespread ecotypes that evolve as precursors to species. A corollary to this debate is the question of whether speciation is reversible and, if so, how does it become irreversible? A third wave of interest in stages in the process of speciation is currently underway, thus making a modern historical narrative of the debate important. Both contemporary and past evolutionary biologists have argued that viewing speciation as being composed of stages can free researchers from concerns over species definitions and focus attention on the mechanisms involved in the process. How speciation becomes irreversible and whether ecogeographically isolated ecotypes are integral to this process remain as important unresolved issues.",W1551758422,False,0.8150240182876587

As a result, adaptive genetic and phenotypic divergence can occur among populations living in different habitats. We investigated patterns of differentiation between contrasting lake and stream habitats in the cyprinid fish European minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) at both the morphological and genomic levels using geometric morphometrics and AFLP markers, respectively. We also used a spatial correlative approach to identify AFLP loci associated with environmental variables representing potential selective forces responsible for adaptation to divergent habitats. Our results identified different morphologies between lakes and streams, with lake fish presenting a deeper body and caudal peduncle compared to stream fish. Body shape variation conformed to a priori predictions concerning biomechanics and swimming performance in lakes vs. streams. Moreover, morphological differentiation was found to be associated with several environmental variables, which could impose selection on body and caudal peduncle shape. We found adaptive genetic divergence between these contrasting habitats in the form of 'outlier' loci (2.9%) whose genetic divergence exceeded neutral expectations. We also detected additional loci (6.6%) not associated with habitat type (lake vs. stream), but contributing to genetic divergence between populations. Specific environmental variables related to trophic dynamics, landscape topography and geography were associated with several neutral and outlier loci.

,Detecting Fisheries-Induced Life-History Evolution: An Overview of the Reaction-Norm Approach,"Life-history theory unequivocally suggests that fishing acts as a powerful driver of life-history evolution in exploited fish populations. Because life-history traits are closely linked to the dynamics and productivity of fish populations, understand ing and documenting the extent to which this expectation is borne out in reality is both scientifically and practically important. The primary empirical challenges are twofold: observing phenotypic change does not imply genetic change as life-history traits are phenotypically plastic, and fishing is but one potential driver of contem porary evolution. here we focus on the first challenge by describing how to work toward disentangling genetic and plastic effects in the absence of genetic data. In particular, we explain how the consideration of maturation reaction norms helps to disentangle genetic and plastic changes in age and size at maturation. We first out line the logic and limitations of the maturation reaction-norm approach. We then review the most important statistical methods available for estimating maturation reaction norms from empirical data. For each of these methods, we discuss its do main of applicability together with its strengths and weaknesses. Life-history theory suggests that much of the diversity in life-history characteris tics can be attributed to alternative means of coping with different mortality patterns (Roff, 1992; Stearns, 1992). For fish, changes in mortality caused by industrial-scale fishing are drastic, in terms of both magnitude and pattern: mortality imposed by fishing can exceed natural mortality by several hundred percent and typically in",W194210619,False,0.6391079425811768

On a large scale, data provided little evidence to support clustering of populations according to geographical region. Hierarchical analysis of molecular variance indicated that, although statistically significant, only 2.17% of the variance in allelic frequencies was partitioned at the among‐region level. Within regions, high levels of genetic differentiation were typically found between lakes regardless of the geographical distance separating them. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of rapid postglacial recolonization of all of northwest Europe from a single charr lineage, with subsequent restriction of gene flow. On a smaller scale, there was evidence for close genetic relationships among lakes from within common drainage basins in Scotland. Thus, interlake genetic structure reflects localized patterns of recent (or contemporary) gene flow superimposed onto a larger scale structure that is largely a result of historical processes. There was also evidence for widespread genetic structuring at the within‐lake level, with sympatric populations detected in 10 lakes, and multilocus heterozygote deficits found in 23 lakes. This evidence of the Wahlund effect was found in all lakes known to contain discrete phenotypic morphs, as well as many others, suggesting that morphs may often represent separate breeding populations, and also that the phenomenon of polymorphism in this species may be more widespread than is currently realized.",W1889769886,False,0.8311122059822083

The values of FIS and FST can be computed using this property.

https://doi.org/10.1017/s0094837300014056,Contributions of individual taxa to overall morphological disparity,"Two methods are discussed for assessing the contributions of subgroups to the morphological disparity of the larger group containing them. (1) Given an ordination of points representing specimens or species in morphological space, morphological disparity of the entire group is measured as the average squared distance of points from the centroid. The contribution that a subgroup makes to morphological disparity is measured as the average squared distance of its points from the overall centroid (not the subgroup centroid), weighted by the subgroup sample size relative to the total group sample size. Thus, morphological disparity of a group can be additively partitioned into the disparity components of its subgroups, and the relative contributions of these subgroups can be assessed quantitatively. (2) An alternative approach is to compare morphological disparity of a group to the disparity it would have if a certain subgroup were omitted. If the resulting disparity differs substantially from the original disparity, then the subgroup in question is considered to have a significant effect on morphological disparity. Because some subgroups are very centralized in morphological space, omitting them can cause an increase in morphological disparity when disparity is measured as the average dissimilarity among species. In general, relatively large subgroups that are located peripherally in morphospace make the greatest contributions to morphological disparity, and failure to sample smaller groups often has little effect on disparity estimates. The two methods are applied to morphological disparity in trilobites, partitioned at different levels in the taxonomic hierarchy. Results of the two methods are intuitively reasonable and largely in agreement, and point to the predominance of Early Cambrian olenelloids, Cambro-Ordovician Libristoma, Ordovician Asaphina and Cheirurina, Siluro-Devonian Phacopida and Phacopina, and Devonian Proetida.",W1524324886,False,0.013790016993880272

,Sexual dimorphism or evolutionary branching,"Disruptive selection due to ecological causes can lead to different types of phenotypic polymorphism. For a broad range of ecological scenarios, we investigate the odds that disruptive selection leads to sexual dimorphism relative to polymorphisms that appear after evolutionary branching. These involve genetic polymorphism, such as sympatric species or Mendelian genes with strong dominance-recessivity. When models that allow for sexual dimorphism are compared with constrained models with equal phenotypes in males and females, a sexual dimorphism is expected to evolve instead of the evolutionary branching in the constrained model. This is an important general result on the odds of different types of ecological polymorphism. It implies that the possibility for sympatric speciation caused by ecological selection pressures can be removed by the evolution of ecological differences between the sexes. Evolutionary branching becomes more likely when: (1) there is a strong constraint on sex differentiation; (2) secondary branching events occur after sexual dimorphism has already evolved; (3) assortative mate choice occurs before trait divergence starts. The possibility of sexual selection driving sympatric speciation is not affected by our conclusions.",W1503501297,False,0.8034573197364807

https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/122.1.235,The maintenance of genetic variability in two-locus models of stabilizing selection.,"Abstract The maintenance of genetic variability at two diallelic loci under stabilizing selection is investigated. Generations are discrete and nonoverlapping; mating is random; mutation and random genetic drift are absent; selection operates only through viability differences. The determination of the genotypic values is purely additive. The fitness function has its optimum at the value of the double heterozygote and decreases monotonically and symmetrically from its optimum, but is otherwise arbitrary. The resulting fitness scheme is identical to the symmetric viability model. Linkage disequilibrium is neglected, but the results are otherwise exact. Explicit formulas are found for all the equilibria, and explicit conditions are derived fro their existence and stability. A complete classification of the six possible global convergence patterns is presented. In addition to the symmetric equilibrium (with gene frequency 1/2 at both loci), a pair of unsymmetric equilibria may exist; the latter are usually, but not always, unstable. If the ratio of the effect of the major locus to that of the minor one exceeds a critical value, both loci will be stably polymorphic. If selection is weak at the minor locus, the more rapidly the fitness function decreases near the optimum, the lower is this critical value; for rapidly decreasing fitness functions, the critical value is close to one. If the fitness function is smooth at the optimum, then a stable polymorphism exists at both loci only if selection is strong at the major locus.",W1822425766,False,0.1264946311712265
https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/127.1.229,Natural and sexual selection on many loci.,"Abstract A method is developed that describes the effects on an arbitrary number of autosomal loci of selection on haploid and diploid stages, of nonrandom mating between haploid individuals, and of recombination. We provide exact recursions for the dynamics of allele frequencies and linkage disequilibria (nonrandom associations of alleles across loci). When selection is weak relative to recombination, our recursions provide simple approximations for the linkage disequilibria among arbitrary combinations of loci. We show how previous models of sex-independent natural selection on diploids, assortative mating between haploids, and sexual selection on haploids can be analyzed in this framework. Using our weak-selection approximations, we derive new results concerning the coevolution of male traits and female preferences under natural and sexual selection. In particular, we provide general expressions for the intensity of linkage-disequilibrium induced selection experienced by loci that contribute to female preferences for specific male traits. Our general results support the previous observation that these indirect selection forces are so weak that they are unlikely to dominate the evolution of preference-producing loci.",W1901763315,False,0.12910085916519165

In both cases one trait is considered and the interactions within and between loci are assumed to be additive. Contrary to most earlier investigations of this problem no a priori assumptions on the distribution of genotypic values are imposed. For a deterministic two-locus two-allele model with recombination and mutation, related to the symmetric viability model, a complete nonlinear analysis is performed. It is shown that, depending on the recombination rate, multiple stable equilibria may coexist. The equilibrium genetic and genic variances are calculated. For a polygenic trait in a finite population with a possible continuum of allelic effects a simulation study is performed. In both models the equilibrium genetic and genic variances are roughly equal to the house-of-cards prediction or its finite population counterpart as long as the recombination rate is not extremely low. However, negative linkage disequilibrium builds up. If the loci are very closely linked the equilibrium additive genetic variance is slightly lower than the house-of-cards prediction, but the genic variance is much higher. Depending on whether the parameters are in favor of the house-of-cards or the Gaussian approximation, different behavior of the genetic system occurs with respect to linkage.",W1936408530,False,0.013736986555159092
https://doi.org/10.1017/s0016672300023156,The maintenance of polygenic variation through a balance between mutation and stabilizing selection,"Summary The maintenance of polygenic variation through a balance between mutation and stabilizing selection can be approximated in two ways. In the ‘Gaussian’ approximation, a normal distribution of allelic effects is assumed at each locus. In the ‘House of Cards’ approximation, the effect of new mutations is assumed to be large compared with the spread of the existing distribution. These approximations were developed to describe models where alleles may have a continuous range of effects. However, previous analyses of models with only two alleles have predicted an equilibrium variance equal to that given by the ‘House of Cards’ approximation. These analyses of biallelic models have assumed that, at equilibrium, the population mean is at the optimum. Here, it is shown that many stable equilibria may coexist, each giving a slight deviation from the optimum. Though the variance is given by the ‘House of Cards’ approximation when the mean is at the optimum, it increases towards a value of the same order as that given by the ‘Gaussian’ approximation when the mean deviates from the optimum. Thus, the equilibrium variance cannot be predicted by any simple model, but depends on the previous history of the population.",W1991285631,False,0.21132512390613556

This book presents an overview and selected sample of these results and ideas, organized by biological theme rather than mathematical concept, with an emphasis on helping the reader develop appropriate modeling skills through use of well-chosen and varied examples. Part I starts with unstructured single species population models, particularly in the framework of continuous time models, then adding the most rudimentary stage structure with variable stage duration. The theme of stage structure in an age-dependent context is developed in Part II, covering demographic concepts, such as life expectation and variance of life length, and their dynamic consequences. In Part III, the author considers the dynamic interplay of host and parasite populations, i.e., the epidemics and endemics of infectious diseases. The theme of stage structure continues here in the analysis of different stages of infection and of age-structure that is instrumental in optimizing vaccination strategies. Each section concludes with exercises, some with solutions, and suggestions for further study. The level of mathematics is relatively modest; a toolbox provides a summary of required results in differential equations, integration, and integral equations. In addition, a selection of Maple worksheets is provided.

The full equilibrium structure and qualitative gene-frequency dynamics are derived analytically for a symmetric model, in which pairwise fitnesses are chiefly determined by the genetic similarity of the individuals involved. This is supplemented by an extensive numerical investigation of the general model, the symmetric model, and nine other special cases. Together the results show that there is a high potential for permanent genetic diversity in the pairwise interaction model, and provide insight into the extent to which various forms of genotypic interactions enhance or reduce this potential. Technically, although two stable polymorphic equilibria are possible, the increased likelihood of maintaining both alleles, and the poor performance of protected polymorphism conditions as a measure of this likelihood, are primarily due to a greater variety and frequency of equilibrium patterns with one stable polymorphic equilibrium, in conjunction with a disproportionately large domain of attraction for stable internal equilibria.",W1906801735,False,0.024513617157936096
https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/152.2.807,Genetic Variation Maintained in Multilocus Models of Additive Quantitative Traits Under Stabilizing Selection,"Abstract Stabilizing selection for an intermediate optimum is generally considered to deplete genetic variation in quantitative traits. However, conflicting results from various types of models have been obtained. While classical analyses assuming a large number of independent additive loci with individually small effects indicated that no genetic variation is preserved under stabilizing selection, several analyses of two-locus models showed the contrary. We perform a complete analysis of a generalization of Wright’s two-locus quadratic-optimum model and investigate numerically the ability of quadratic stabilizing selection to maintain genetic variation in additive quantitative traits controlled by up to five loci. A statistical approach is employed by choosing randomly 4000 parameter sets (allelic effects, recombination rates, and strength of selection) for a given number of loci. For each parameter set we iterate the recursion equations that describe the dynamics of gamete frequencies starting from 20 randomly chosen initial conditions until an equilibrium is reached, record the quantities of interest, and calculate their corresponding mean values. As the number of loci increases from two to five, the fraction of the genome expected to be polymorphic declines surprisingly rapidly, and the loci that are polymorphic increasingly are those with small effects on the trait. As a result, the genetic variance expected to be maintained under stabilizing selection decreases very rapidly with increased number of loci. The equilibrium structure expected under stabilizing selection on an additive trait differs markedly from that expected under selection with no constraints on genotypic fitness values. The expected genetic variance, the expected polymorphic fraction of the genome, as well as other quantities of interest, are only weakly dependent on the selection intensity and the level of recombination.",W1911509246,False,0.10766413062810898

The homozygous and heterozygous effects of the inserts on viability and abdominal and sternopleural bristle number were ascertained by comparing the chromosome lines with inserts to insert-free control lines of the inbred host strain. P elements reduced average homozygous viability by 12.2% per insert and average heterozygous viability by 5.5% per insert, and induced recessive lethal mutations at a rate of 3.8% per insert. Mutational variation for the bristle traits averaged over both sexes was 0.03Ve per homozygous P insert and 0.003Ve per heterozygous P insert, where Ve is the environmental variance. Mutational variation was greater for the sexes considered separately because inserts had large pleiotropic effects on sex dimorphism of bristle characters. The distributions of homozygous effects of inserts on the bristle traits were asymmetrical, with the largest effects in the direction of reducing bristle number; and highly leptokurtic, with most of the increase in variance contributed by a few lines with large effects.

The phoretic flower mites that hummingbirds compete with for nectar show the same pattern. An analysis of phylogenetically independent contrasts for 154 hummingbird and 37 mite species confirmed that both small (female-larger) and large (male-larger) species contribute to this result. I propose a common cause for this convergent pattern of sexual size dimorphism, with support from ecological and behavioral data for both groups. When morphology or behavior constrains each species to a limited range of resource densities, natural selection tends to diversify body size among species. If mating is promiscuous or polygynous, sexual selection favors larger males when resources are sufficient. But if male reproductive behavior is energetically costly, smaller males may have an advantage when resources are limiting, producing a pattern of allometry for sexual size dimorphism that conforms with Rensch's rule. Stabilizing selection on female size, if it occurs, amplifies this pattern. When the resource-density spectrum is broad enough, both female-larger and male-larger size dimorphism should occur within the same clade.",W1984488170,False,0.80772864818573

A closer examination of the model using a computer simulation reveals that there are a number of implicit assumptions necessary for reinforcement to work. 1. It requires that reproductive characters form part of an open genetic system with high heritability and that there is considerable variability within this system. 2. The two strains must coexist throughout the period in which selection is acting. This requires intense frequency-dependent selection to counteract the inherently unstable selection regime of negative heterosis. The necessary intensity suggests that extinction of one of the strains is the more likely outcome unless there are substantial initial differences in reproductive characters. Furthermore, chance extinction of one of the strains cannot occur in this selection period. 3. The net cost of assortative characters must be less than the cost of a greater probability of producing hybrid offspring. This is a complex matter with several opposing factors. 4. The fitness of the hybrids must be zero or close to it and must remain so. 5. The selective pressure for assortative reproductive characters becomes weaker as these characters are established. It appears unlikely that selection alone could complete the process, as is hypothesized in some formulations of the model. Further data from natural populations and laboratory experiments are required to clarify several of these points, especially the first. These problems do not mean that reinforcement can never occur, but they do imply that speciation by reinforcement is not nearly as prevalent as much of the biological literature suggests.",W1966329389,False,0.1589035540819168

How P‐I responses vary with mat thickness and with community composition has not been considered in detail. We used a combined approach of modeling, microscale determinations of photosynthetic rate and light attenuation, and whole‐assemblage O 2 flux measurements to explore P‐I relationships. The modeling approach suggested that the onset of photosynthetic saturation and photoinhibition will occur at higher irradiance and that whole‐mat photoinhibition (decreased photosynthesis at very high irradiance), biomass‐specific maximum photosynthetic rate, and initial slope of the P‐I function (α) should decrease as assemblage thickness increases or light attenuation increases. Spherical light microsensor profiles for a variety of stream algae indicated a strongly compressed photic zone with attenuation coefficients of 70–1791 m −1 for scalar photosynthetic photon fluence density.

On ST and ST-a media, refractile granules were formed instead. These granules had no insecticidal activity against silkworms and were isolated and identified as poly-β-hydroxybutyric acid. Supplementation of the potassium-deficient ST-a medium with 0.1% KH 2 PO 4 (3.7 mM) led to the formation of crystalline δ-endotoxin. The replacement of KH 2 PO 4 with equimolar amounts of KCl, KNO 3, and potassium acetate or an equivalent amount of K 2 SO 4 had a similar effect, whereas the addition of an equimolar amount of NaH 2 PO 4 or NH 4 H 2 PO 4 did not cause the endotoxin to form. An asporogenous mutant, B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain 290-1, produced δ-endotoxin on ST-a medium supplemented with 3 mM or more potassium but formed only poly-β-hydroxybutyric acid granules on the media containing ≤1 mM potassium. These results clearly indicate that a certain concentration of potassium is essential for the fermentative production of δ-endotoxin by these isolates of B. thuringiensis. Manganese could not be substituted for potassium. Phosphate ions stimulated poly-β-hydroxybutyric acid formation by strain 290-1. The sporulation of B. thuringiensis and several other Bacillus strains was suppressed on the potassium-deficient ST medium. This suggests that potassium plays an essential role not only in Bacillus cell growth and δ-endotoxin formation but also in sporulation.",W1518308464,False,0.12352290004491806

https://doi.org/10.1126/science.179.4068.35,Population Cycles in Small Rodents,"We conclude that population fluctuations in Microtus in southern Indiana are produced by a syndrome of changes in birth and death rates similar to that found in other species of voles and lemmings. The mechanisms which cause the changes in birth and death rates are demolished by fencing the population so that no dispersal can occur. Dispersal thus seems critical for population regulation in Microtus. Because most dispersal occurs during the increase phase of the population cycle and there is little dispersal during the decline phase, dispersal is not directly related to population density. Hence the quality of dispersing animals must be important, and we have found one case of increased dispersal tendency by one genotype. The failure of population regulation of Microtus in enclosed areas requires an explanation by any hypothesis attempting to explain population cycles in small rodents. It might be suggested that the fence changed the predation pressure on the enclosed populations. However, the fence was only 2 feet (0.6 meter) high and did not stop the entrance of foxes, weasels, shrews, or avian predators. A striking feature was that the habitat in the enclosures quickly recovered from complete devastation by the start of the spring growing season. Obviously the habitat and food quality were sufficient to support Microtus populations of abnormally high densities, and recovery of the habitat was sufficiently quick that the introduction of new animals to these enclosed areas resulted in another population explosion. Finally, hypotheses of population regulation by social stress must account for the finding that Microtus can exist at densities several times greater than normal without ""stress"" taking an obvious toll. We hypothesize that the prevention of dispersal changes the quality of the populations in the enclosures in comparison to those outside the fence. Voles forced to remain in an overcrowded fenced population do not suffer high mortality rates and continue to reproduce at abnormally high densities until starvation overtakes them. The initial behavioral interactions associated with crowding do not seem sufficient to cause voles to die in situ. What happens to animals during the population decline? Our studies have not answered this question. The animals did not appear to disperse, but it is possible that the method we used to measure dispersal (movement into a vacant habitat) missed a large segment of dispersing voles which did not remain in the vacant area but kept on moving. Perhaps the dispersal during the increase phase of the population cycle is a colonization type of dispersal, and the animals taking part in it are likely to stay in a new habitat, while during the population decline dispersal is a pathological response to high density, and the animals are not attracted to settling even in a vacant habitat. The alternative to this suggestion is that animals are dying in situ during the decline because of physiological or genetically determined behavioral stress. Thus the fencing of a population prevents the change in rates of survival and reproduction, from high rates in the increase phase to low rates in the decline phase, and the fenced populations resemble ""mouse plagues."" A possible explanation is that the differential dispersal of animals during the phase of increase causes the quality of the voles remaining at peak densities in wild populations to be different from the quality of voles at much higher densities in enclosures. Increased sensitivity to density in Microtus could cause the decline of wild populations at densities lower than those reached by fenced populations in which selection through dispersal has been prevented. Fencing might also alter the social interactions among Microtus in other ways that are not understood. The analysis of colonizing species by MacArthur and Wilson (27) can be applied to our studies of dispersal in populations of Microtus. Groups of organisms with good dispersal and colonizing ability are called r strategists because they have high reproductive potential and are able to exploit a new environment rapidly. Dispersing voles seem to be r strategists. Young females in breeding condition were over-represented in dispersing female Microtus (17). The Tf(C)/Tf(E) females, which were more common among dispersers during the phase of population increase (Fig. 6), also have a slight reproductive advantage over the other Tf genotypes (19). Thus in Microtus populations the animals with the highest reproductive potential, the r strategists, are dispersing. The segment of the population which remains behind after the selection-via-dispersal are those individuals which are less influenced by increasing population densities. These are the individuals which maximize use of the habitat, the K strategists in MacArthur and Wilson's terminology, or voles selected for spacing behavior. Thus we can describe population cycles in Microtus in the same theoretical framework as colonizing species on islands. Our work on Microtus is consistent with the hypothesis of genetic and behavioral effects proposed by Chitty (6) (Fig. 7) in that it shows both behavioral differences in males during the phases of population fluctuation and periods of strong genetic selection. The greatest gaps in our knowledge are in the area of genetic-behavioral interactions which are most difficult to measure. We have no information on the heritability of aggressive behavior in voles. The pathways by which behavioral events are translated into physiological changes which affect reproduction and growth have been carefully analyzed by Christian and his associates (28) for rodents in laboratory situations, but the application of these findings to the complex field events described above remains to be done. Several experiments are suggested by our work. First, other populations of other rodent species should increase to abnormal densities if enclosed in a large fenced area (29). We need to find situations in which this prediction is not fulfilled. Island populations may be an important source of material for such an experiment (30). Second, if one-way exit doors were provided from a fenced area, normal population regulation through dispersal should occur. This experiment would provide another method by which dispersers could be identified. Third, if dispersal were prevented after a population reached peak densities, a normal decline phase should occur. This prediction is based on the assumption that dispersal during the increase phase is sufficient to ensure the decline phase 1 or 2 years later. All these experiments are concerned with the dispersal factor, and our work on Microtus can be summarized by the admonition: study dispersal.",W1557923320,False,0.6355352401733398

The 1987 and 1988 breeding seasons differed markedly from each other. In 1987, melt off occurred in April, and the first cohort was born in May (cohort 1). The entire breeding season was favorable owing to frequent rainfall throughout the summer. Cohort 1 animals grew rapidly and females began breeding at 4–5 weeks of age. Likewise, cohort 2 (June) animals exhibited rapid growth and females were breeding at 7–8 weeks of age. Cohort 3 (July and August) animals grew more slowly and most entered the winter as prepubertal animals of subadult size. At the end of the summer, cohort 3 animals represented &gt;70% of the voles recruited during the breeding season. In 1988, following melt off in late April, precipitation was below normal and the situation intensified to severe drought through the summer. The growth rates of cohort 1 and 2 animals were significantly lower than 1987 growth rates, and very few females attained sexual maturity. At the end of the summer, cohort 3 animals represented &lt;25% of the total recruitment at both study sites.

Both steps have uncertainty when applied to the very small bacteria typically found in natural seawater. In the present study, natural bacterioplankton assemblages were freshly collected, passed through 0.6-μm-pore-size Nuclepore filters to remove larger particulate materials, and diluted for growth in 0.22-μm-pore-size Millipore filter-sterilized unenriched seawater. This provided cells comparable in size and morphology to those in natural seawater, but the cultures were free of the interfering particulate detritus naturally present. Cells were collected on glass-fiber GF/F filters, and biovolumes were corrected for cells passing these filters; C and N were measured with a CHN analyzer. Our criteria for size measurement by epifluorescence photomicrography were confirmed with fluorescent microspheres of known diameters. Surprisingly, in six cultures with average per-cell biovolumes ranging from 0.036 to 0.073 μm 3, the average per-cell carbon biomass was relatively constant at 20 ± 0.08 fg of C (mean ± standard error of the mean).

To test the reliability of abundance data derived from suction sampling, we examined sampling efficiency across a wide range of arthropod groups and tested for effects of species traits, vegetation density, and differences between sites. Suction sampling efficiency was quantified by vacuuming an enclosed meadow area and subsequent removal of the turf, which was treated with heat extraction to collect the remaining arthropods. We obtained 250 pairs of suction and turf samples from seven grasslands with variable vegetation density. High suction sampling efficiencies between 49 and 86% were obtained for Auchenorrhyncha, Heteroptera, Araneida, Curculionoidea, Hymenoptera, and Diptera. In contrast, efficiencies were below 30% for Aphidae, Thysanoptera, Staphylinidae and other Coleoptera, and for soil arthropods such as Collembola, Isopoda, Diplopoda, and Formicidae. Efficiency varied significantly among habitats (sites) for most groups, often more than two-fold. Surprisingly, sampling efficiency for Hymenoptera, Diplopoda, and Collembola increased with vegetation density, probably because aboveground activity of these taxa was higher in dense vegetation. Suction sampling was nearly twice as efficient for spiders living in the vegetation than for spiders living near the soil surface, and cursorial and large-bodied spider species were more efficiently sampled than web-builders and small species. Depending on the sampling effort, suction sampling missed between 49% (one sample) and 31% (250 samples) of the spider species present. Suction sampling efficiency varied more strongly among sites and among arthropod groups than previously recognized. Abundance data derived from suction sampling are strongly underestimated, especially for arthropods living near the soil surface.

https://doi.org/10.2307/3546748,In Search of Operational Trophospecies in a Tropical Aquatic Food Web,"Aggregations of biological species on the basis of trophic similarity (trophospecies) are the basic units of study in food web and ecosystem research, yet little attention has been devoted to articulating objective protocols for defining such aggregations. This study formulates several possible definitions based on alternative measures of similarity and hierarchical clustering. Twenty-four alternative methods were applied to a food web consisting of 116 original trophic entities (OTEs) from a tropical floodplain, for which the relative magnitude of each trophic link was estimated based on dietary data measured as volumetric proportions. The resulting 24 trophic hierarchies were compared based on cophenetic correlation and matrices of OTE pairwise similarity, and patterns ere interpreted based on additional ecological analyses for this system. Similarity measures based on topological food web (presence/absence) data yielded slightly greater cophenetic correlations than did measures based on dietary proportions (flow webs), but, overall, OTE pairwise correlations were not greater for one method relative to the other. The difference between these two approaches is driven by the treatment of weak feeding links; at least for the system considered here, distinctions among dietary generalists were obscured when weak links were weighted lightly. Additively combining the predator and resource aspects of each OTE's trophic role performed better than combining them multiplicatively, In general, there was little correspondence between OTE overlap in resource use and the extent to which predators were shared. Two measures of cluster similarity, one designed by us specifically for food webs (maximum linkage) and the other a standard method (average similarity between clusters), yielded more consistent and ecologically interpretable patterns of aggregation than other measures of cluster similarity considered. In deciding whether two trophospecies should be assigned a trophic link, the maximum linkage convention (in which a link is included if any pair of OTEs, one in each trophospecies, are linked) produced more aggregation than the minimum linkage convention (in which a link is included only if every pair of OTEs, pair members in each of the two trophospecies, is linked). The choice of similarity level for defining trophospecies remained an unresolved issue based on out analysis of this dataset. Perhaps the greatest challenge is posed by sampling bias within empirical datasets, and we ultimately conclude that it is difficult to identify trophospecies in this dataset by strictly objective criteria.",W2015038772,False,0.8014339804649353

For each of 30 declining species, attention is focused on: (1) the external causes of population declines, (2) the demographic mechanisms and (3) experimental tests of proposed external causal factors, together with the outcome of (4) specific conservation measures and (5) agri‐environment schemes. Although each species has responded individually to particular aspects of agricultural change, certain groups of species share common causal factors. For example, declines in the population levels of seed‐eating birds have been driven primarily by herbicide use and the switch from spring‐sown to autumn‐sown cereals, both of which have massively reduced the food supplies of these birds. Their population declines have been associated with reduced survival rates and, in some species, also with reduced reproductive rates. In waders of damp grassland, population declines have been driven mainly by land drainage and the associated intensification of grassland management. This has led to reduced reproductive success, as a result of lowered food availability, together with increased disturbance and trampling by farm stock, and in some localities increased nest predation. The external causal factors of population decline are known (with varying degrees of certainty) for all 30 species considered, and the demographic causal factors are known (again with varying degrees of certainty) for 24 such species. In at least 19 species, proposed causal factors have been tested and confirmed by experiment or by local conservation action, and 12 species have been shown to benefit (in terms of locally increased breeding density) from options available in one or more agri‐environment schemes. Four aspects of agricultural change have been the main drivers of bird population declines, each affecting a wide range of species, namely: (1) weed‐control, mainly through herbicide use; (2) the change from spring‐sown to autumn‐sown cereal varieties, and the associated earlier ploughing of stubbles and earlier crop growth; (3) land drainage and associated intensification of grassland management; and (4) increased stocking densities, mainly of cattle in the lowlands and sheep in the uplands. These changes have reduced the amounts of habitat and/or food available to many species. Other changes, such as the removal of hedgerows and ‘rough patches’, have affected smaller numbers of species, as have changes in the timings of cultivations and harvests. Although at least eight species have shown recent increases in their national population levels, many others seem set to continue declining, or to remain at a much reduced level, unless some relevant aspect of agricultural practice is changed.",W1595994724,False,0.6972882151603699

At the field scale, wintering granivorous passerines and Skylarks Alauda arvensis responded to stewardship habitats (options) such as stubble and wild bird cover designed specifically to benefit them. However, at the farm scale, winter bird counts were higher on scheme than control farms only in the West Midlands, and not in East Anglia where the availability of set‐aside and features managed for game in the wider landscape was higher.

""Nowhere on earth does water move as violently as on wave-swept coasts,"" writes the author, ""and every breaker that comes pounding on the shore places large hydrodynamic forces on the organisms resident there."" Yet wave-swept coral reefs and rocky shores are home to some of the world's most diverse assemblages of plants and animals, and scientists have chosen these environments to carry out much of the recent experimental work in community structure and population dynamics. Until now these studies have been hampered because biologists often lack a working understanding of the mechanics of the wave-swept shore. Mark Denny here supplies that understanding in clear and vivid language. Included are an introduction to wave-induced water motions and the standard theories for describing them, a broad introduction to the hydrodynamic forces these water movements place on plants and animals, and an explanation of how organisms respond to these forces. These tools are put to use in the final chapters in an examination of the mechanisms of ""wave exposure"" and an exploration of the mechanical determinants of size and shape in wave-swept environments.

Consider the flow through a straight pipe of circular cross section and with a smooth wall. For laminar flow each fluid particle moves with uniform velocity along a rectilinear path. Because of viscosity, the velocity of the particles near the wall is smaller than that of the particles at the center. i% order to maintain the motion, a pressure decrease is required which, for laminar flow, is proportional to the first power of the mean flow velocity.

An orthogonal experiment demonstrated that production of yellow dwarfs can be induced by presumed less‐suitable host‐plant species at temperatures of 15 ° and 25 °, but not 20 °C.

Therefore, comparisons were made in a chrysanthemum – aphid system between different methods of assessing population growth rates. The reproductive performances of the aphid species Aphis gossypii and Myzus persicae were measured on two chrysanthemum cultivars using three plant growth stages (young vegetative, budding and flowering). In the first set of experiments, development time and reproduction were used to estimate the population growth rate r m. The mean relative growth rates (MRGR) were also assessed. It was shown for the first time that the relationship between r m and MRGR was influenced by aphid species. In a second experiment, the aphid population increase on a whole plant was measured and r m was estimated by calculating the slope of the (ln transformed) population increase. It is shown that population growth rate is affected by the growth stage of the plant, and that cultivar and aphid species interact with plant growth stage in influencing population growth rate. Thus, no single growth stage of chrysanthemum for maximal aphid population growth can be assigned, but the budding and flowering stage are the most suitable in three out of four aphid × cultivar combinations. Comparison between the results from both experiments demonstrates clearly that more realistic values for r m are obtained when measured on whole plants.",W1968324056,False,0.839482843875885

THE DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS INVOLVED IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE DIFFERENT FORMS,"A theory of the nature of the developmental process resulting in wing polymorphism in aphids is proposed. It is suggested that all aphids begin development as presumptive alatae, and that apterae and intermediates are forms which have become irreversibly diverted from the alate course during development. Experiments are described which indicate that diversion resulting in the production of apterae can occur at any time over a protracted period extending from the late embryonic stages until the second larval moult. Prenatal diversion was demonstrated in the progeny of apterous aphids which had been kept on seedlings at 30° for a few days, and in the progeny of young alate aphids. Decapitation of adult aphids released the larviposition response and also resulted in prenatal diversion of their progeny. Postnatal diversion was readily brought about in first and second instar larvae by keeping them on host seedlings. In the third and fourth instars it could only be produced by extreme measures such as inflicting severe injuries on them, and by parasitization. It is suggested that the theory of polymorphism developed in this paper may be applied to other groups of insects with different forms of adults.

DER MIT DER ERZEUGUNG DER VERSCHIEDENEN FORMEN VERBUNDENE ENTWICKLUNGSVORGANG Bei Aphis craccivora Koch wurden in älteren Embryonen und Larven des 1. Stadiums rudimentäre Flügelanlagen gefunden, gleichgültig ob sie zur Entwicklung von Geflügelten determiniert waren oder nicht.

If this is useful only rarely, plasticity may undergo mutational degradation and be lost from a population. We consider a population of constant size N undergoing loss of plasticity at functional mutation rate m and with selective advantage s associated with loss. Environmental change events occur at rate theta per generation, killing all individuals that lack plasticity. The expected time until loss of plasticity in a fluctuating environment is always at least tau, the expected time until loss of plasticity in a static environment. When mN > 1 and N theta >> 1, we find that plasticity will be maintained for an average of at least 10(8) generations in a single population, provided tau > 18/theta. In a metapopulation, plasticity is retained under the more lenient condition tau > 1.3/theta, irrespective of mN, for a modest number of demes. We calculate both exact and approximate solutions for tau and find that it is linearly dependent only on the logarithm of N, and so, surprisingly, both the population size and the number of demes in the metapopulation make little difference to the retention of plasticity.

We explore this process with a single-locus selection model based on the differential utilization of two distinct resources. Not surprisingly, we show that unexploited niches can be invaded by poorly adapted morphs. Less obviously, we show that heterozygotes often have the lowest fitness at stable polymorphic equilibria. We also show by numerical example that stable two-locus polymorphisms exist, in which the most heterozygous individuals are the least fit.

A DIPLOID MODEL,"ABSTRACT A diploid model is introduced and analyzed in which intraspecific competition is incorporated within the context of density-regulated selection. It is assumed that each genotype has a unique carrying capacity corresponding to the equilibrium population size when only that type is present. Each genotypic fitness at a single diallelic autosomal locus is a decreasing function of a distinctive effective population size perceived as a result of intraspecific competition. The resulting fitnesses are both density and frequency dependent with selective advantage determined by a balance between genotypic carrying capacity and sensitivity to intraspecific competition. A major finding is that intergenotypic interactions may allow genetic variation to be more easily maintained than in the corresponding model of purely density-dependent selection. In addition, numerical study confirms the possible existence of multiple interior equilibria and that neither overdominance in fitness nor carrying capacity is necessary for stability. The magnitude of the equilibrium population size and optimization principles are also discussed.",W1931575775,False,0.05023333057761192

One consequence of cannibalism is that cannibals may occasionally have to choose between eating a relative or a nonrelative. Do cannibals discriminate among potential prey? In particular, do they avoid eating relatives?

When housed with smaller larvae that differed in relatedness, both cannibals and typicals preferentially consumed less-related individuals. Cannibals ate typicals much quicker when the choice was between nonkin and siblings than when the choice was between nonkin and cousins, indicating that cannibals could distinguish different categories of relatives. Cannibals were less likely to eat a larval sibling that was a cannibal morph than a sibling that was a typical morph. Occluding animals' nares temporarily eliminated kin discrimination, implying that olfaction is important in recognition. Larvae from different sibships varied considerably in their ability to discriminate kin, and the greater the probability that a larva from a given sibship would develop into a cannibal morph, the more likely the members of that sibship were to discriminate kin.

However, since most of these results rely on limited numerical analyses, their generality has been debated. Here, we consider one of the standard models (the so-called Roughgarden model) with a simplified genetics where the selected trait is determined by a single diallelic locus. This model is sufficiently complex to maintain key properties of the general multilocus case but simple enough to allow for comprehensive analytical treatment by means of invasion fitness arguments. Depending on (1) the strength and (2) the shape of stabilizing selection, (3) the strength and (4) the shape of pairwise competition, (5) the shape of the mating function, and (6) whether assortative mating leads to sexual selection, we find five different evolutionary regimes. In one of these regimes, complete reproductive isolation can evolve through arbitrarily small steps in the strength of assortative mating.

https://doi.org/10.2307/1942423,Presence and Absence of Habitat Shift in Some Widespread Lizard Species,"This study analyzes the circumstances under which certain lizards shift and fail to shift their habitats. At each of 20 localities, I measured the structural habitats utilized by all the diurnal arboreal lizard species as well as the availability of those habitats. I selected localities so as to include for four widespread species (Anolis grahami, A. sagrei, A. carolinensis, A. distichus) nearly all of the species—combinations in which they occur. Data were fitted to equations that (1) adjust for locality—specific differences in vegetation, and (2) estimate the direction and intensity of apparent interaction between sympatric forms. Shift was valuated both for species and separately for age and sex classes within species. Female—sized individuals shift more frequently than do adult ♂ ♂. Linear equations that evaluate sympatric forms one at a time showed the strongest apparent competitors for a widespread from to be (1) adult ♂ ♂ rather than female—sized individuals, especially when adult ♂ ♂ represent the widespread species; (2) species of similar climatic habitat; (3) classes of similar size (especially against female—sized individuals of widespread species; and (4) classes of large size (especially against adult ♂ ♂). The most abundant classes are the strongest apparent competitors for A. distichus but not for the other widespread species. These results are unchanged or strengthened when different habitat categories or nonlinear equations are used. Combining all sympatric forms into locality—specific linear equations supports Results 1 and 2 but is inconclusive for Results 3 and 4. The parameter proportional to the size of a refugium from interference is estimated for some cases to be significantly greater for female—size individuals than for adult ♂ ♂. In general, results imply that animals similar to widespread forms in some niche dimension other than structural habitat are those most likely to cause shift in structural habitat. In addition, they suggest existence of a competition function with respect to size: in such a function intensity of competition is uniquely determined by the direction and amount of size difference, regardless of the competitors' absolute sizes. Competition intensity appears to (1) decrease overall with increasing difference in size, (2) be greater for a given size difference if the competitor is larger than if it is smaller, and (3) decrease at nonconstant rates, such that near complete size similarity there is a more rapid decline in intensity for smaller than larger competitors.

This postulate would be especially relevant if it were shown that deleterious mutations interact in such a way that their individual negative effects are reinforced by each other. The hypothesis of synergism can be tested experimentally by crossing organisms bearing deleterious mutations and comparing the fitness of the parents and their progeny. The present study used laboratory strains of the budding yeast burdened with mutations resulting from absence of a major DNA mismatch repair function. Only in one, or possibly two, crosses out of eight did fitness of the progeny deviate from that of their parents in a direction indicating synergism. Furthermore, the distributions of progeny fitness were not skewed as would be expected if strong interactions were present. The choice of experimental material ensured that genetic recombination was extensive, all four meiotic products were available for fitness assays, and that the mutations were probably numerous. Despite this generally favourable experimental setting, synergism did not appear to be a dominating force shaping fitness of yeast containing randomly generated mutations.",W1489953757,False,0.00902791228145361

Disruption of the MSH1 gene caused a petite phenotype which was established rapidly. A functional MSH1 gene present on a single-copy centromere plasmid was incapable of rescuing the established msh1 petite phenotype. Analysis of msh1 strains demonstrated that mutagenesis and large-scale rearrangement of mitochondrial DNA had occurred. 4',6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining of msh1 yeast revealed an aberrant distribution of mtDNA. Haploid msh2 mutants displayed an increase of 85-fold in the rate of spontaneous mutation to canavanine resistance. Sporulation of homozygous msh2/msh2 diploids gave rise to a high level of lethality which was compounded during increased vegetative growth prior to sporulation. msh2 mutations also affected gene conversion of two HIS4 alleles. The his4x mutation, lying near the 5' end of the gene, was converted with equal frequency in both wild-type and msh2 strains. However, many of the events in the msh2 background were post-meiotic segregation (PMS) events (46.4%) while none (&amp;lt; 0.25%) of the aberrant segregations in wild type were PMS events. The his4b allele, lying 1.6 kb downstream of his4x, was converted at a 10-fold higher frequency in the msh2 background than in the corresponding wild-type strain. Like the his4x allele, his4b showed a high level of PMS (30%) in the msh2 background compared to the corresponding wild-type strain where no (&amp;lt; 0.26%) PMS events were observed. These results indicate that MSH1 plays a role in repair or stability of mtDNA and MSH2 plays a role in repair of 4-bp insertion/deletion mispairs in the nucleus.",W1862994794,False,0.033625926822423935

This result contradicts previous work that indicated that epistasis will halt the ratchet. The present results show that epistasis will not halt the ratchet provided that rather than a single deleterious mutation effect, there is a distribution of deleterious mutation effects with sufficient density near zero. In addition to epistasis and mutation distribution, the ability of Muller's ratchet to lead to the extinction of an asexual population under epistasis for fitness depends strongly on the expected number of offspring that survive to reproductive age. This strong dependence is not present in the nonepistatic model and suggests that interpreting the population growth parameter as fecundity is inadequate. Because a continuous distribution of mutation effects is used in this model, an emphasis is placed on the dynamics of the mutation effect distribution rather than on the dynamics of the number of least mutation loaded individuals. This perspective suggests that current models of gene interaction are too simple to apply directly to long-term prediction for populations undergoing the ratchet.",W1890167219,False,0.39272186160087585

Under the name of borreliosis, the disease is also common in Europe. As Americans have become aware of the hazard they face from Lyme disease, they have become anxious to know how to avoid or control the disease. But the complex ecological interactions of Lyme disease make that extremely difficult. The disease is caused by a microorganism, a spirochete, which is carried by tiny ticks. The ticks, in turn, are transported from place to place by their hosts: humans, deer, white-tailed mice, dogs, lizards, and many other animals and birds. Both ticks and their hosts serve as a reservoir for the disease. As with any tick-borne disease, the best hope of prevention lies in understanding and interrupting the lifecycle of the microorganism, its vectors, and their hosts.This book is the first attempt to survey the natural history, ecology, population dynamics, geography, and environmental management of Lyme disease. Eighteen leading American researchers on Lyme disease explain the current state of knowledge and comment candidly on the theoretical and practical advantages and difficulties with each technique of surveillance, self-protection, and tick control.

https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.1981.0005,The population dynamics of microparasites and their invertebrate hosts,"We show how directly transmitted microparasites, broadly defined to include viruses, bacteria, protozoans and fungi, may regulate natural populations of invertebrate hosts. The study combines elements of conventional epidemiology (where the host population is assumed constant) with elements of prey-predator studies (which conventionally emphasize how prey and predator populations may be regulated by their interaction). To this end, we construct simple models embodying the essentials of the dynamical interaction between invertebrate hosts and their directly transmitted microparasites. In successive refinements, these models include the effects of recovery and disease-induced mortality, castration or diminished reproduction of infected hosts, vertical transmission, latent periods of infection, stress-related pathogenicity, the interplay between disease and other density-dependent constraints on host population growth, and free-living infective stages. In analysing the dynamical behaviour of these models, we focus on : the possible regulation of the host population by the parasite; the basic reproductive rate of the parasite, and the way in which it affects the dynamics and the evolution of the host-parasite association; and the threshold host density and its implications for endemic or epidemic maintenance of the infection. These are examined in the light of synoptic compilations of field and laboratory data on: birth rates (and disease-induced reduction thereof), natural death rates and disease-induced death rates of hosts; latent periods and efficiencies of vertical transmission of pathogens; the rate of production and lifetime of free-living infective stages; and some characteristics of long-term cycles and of epidemic outbreaks of disease in forest insects. In particular, our models suggest that the baculovirus and microsporidian infections of many temperate forest insects will tend to produce stable cycles in host abundance and in prevalence of infection, with periods in the range 5-12 years. Enough is known about the European larch budmoth and an associated granulosis virus for us to undertake a detailed comparison between theory and data that strongly suggests that the observed 9-10 year cycles are driven by the host-parasite interaction. We also discuss the possible control of invertebrate pest species by pathogens, showing how our models could guide laboratory or field studies, to help estimate whether a given pathogen is capable of regulating the target pest population, and, if so, roughly what quantity is needed to effect a specific level of (local) control.

,The Fire Ants,"Walter Tschinkel's passion for fire ants has been stoked by over 30 years of exploring the rhythm and drama of Solenopsis invicta's biology. Since South American fire ants arrived in Mobile, Alabama, in the 1940s, they have spread to become one of the most reviled pests in the Sunbelt. In Fire Ants, Tschinkel provides not just an encyclopaedic overview of S. invicta - how they found colonies, construct and defend their nests, forage and distribute food, struggle among themselves for primacy, and even relocate entire colonies - but a lively account of how research is done, how science establishes facts, and the pleasures and problems of a scientific career. Between chapters detailed enough for experts but readily accessible to any educated reader, 'interludes' provide vivid verbal images of the world of fire ants and the people who study them. Early chapters describe the several failed, and heavily politically influenced, eradication campaigns, and later ones, the remarkable spread of S. invicta's 'polygyne' form, in which nests harbour multiple queens and colonies reproduce by 'budding'. The reader learns much about ants, the practice of science, and humans' role in the fire ant's North American success.",W1567750766,False,0.06815235316753387

However, the existence of such trade-off relationships has recently been challenged. Here, we study how a trade-off can emerge from a model that explicitly incorporates within-host dynamics. We find that the existence and the convexity of the trade-off are robust, which implies a definite level of evolutionarily stable virulence (ESV) for the parasite. However, we also show that the dependence of the ESV on parameter values may be very strong. One possible consequence of this sensitivity is that relationships between transmission and virulence observed across populations need not conform to the patterns expected on the basis of a common (fixed) trade-off.

The process was initiated by the formation of a new cross wall under a preexisting layer of cylindrical wall. An annular notch appeared to cut through the overlying wall and presumably allowed the cross wall to split into two layers of peripheral wall. During this initial notching process, two raised bands of wall material were produced which resembled those previously observed in morphological studies of Streptococcus faecalis. Through an improved fixation technique, it was possible to preserve the bands seen in B. subtilis to the extent that they were used as markers to study the subsequent stages of septal growth. These stages included (i) the continued displacement of the two bands from the cross wall (as the two nascent polar surfaces enlarged and as the diameter of the cross wall decreased), (ii) the closure of the cross wall, and (iii) the final severance of the common cross wall connection between two completed poles. To study this process in a more quantitative manner, three-dimensional reconstructions of the envelope observed between pairs of the raised bands were made from axial thin sections of cells. The process of reconstruction was based on a technique by which x, y coordinates were taken from thin sections and were rotated around the cell's central axis. These reconstructions were used to estimate the surface area or volume of the reconstructed zones or their parts. A round of septal growth was then simulated by arranging 118 reconstructions in order of increasing surface area or volume. The topology of the process was studied by noting how various measurements of septal thickness, length, surface area, and volume varied as a function of increasing septal zone size. This analysis was based on several assumptions, of which three of the most important are: (i) the bands produced by the initial notching process are markers which separate septal from cylindrical wall growth; (ii) a septal zone observed between pairs of bands is made up of two nascent poles and a single cross wall; and (iii) as septal zones develop in terms of relative age they increase in size (volume or surface area) or amount of wall. The data suggested that the S. faecalis model of surface growth (in which polar growth occurs through a regulated constrictive separation and expansion of a cross wall) also seems applicable to the pattern of septal growth observed here for B. subtilis. This was indicated from measurements which showed that increases in the size of nascent polar surfaces were correlated with decreases in cross wall diameter. An explanation of these observations may be that decreases in cross wall diameter were due to a progressive splitting of the cross wall that removed surface from the outer circumference of the cross wall and converted it into new polar surface. Calculations further suggested that if the poles of B. subtilis were made by this model a sizeable and variable increase in surface area of the cross wall would also be required to convert these separating cross wall layers into two curved polar structures. Measurements of wall thickness taken from various locations within septal zones indicated that while the thickness of the polar wall of B. subtilis was constant over its surface, the width of the cross wall varied considerably during a round of synthesis. Again, one of the simplest explanations compatible with these observations and those previously made in S. faecalis is that the B. subtilis cross wall is brought to a constant thickness (possibly by remodeling or precursor addition) before or during separation. Although most observations made from the reconstruction of the septal zones of B. subtilis may fit the S. faecalis model of surface growth, differences in the pattern of septal growth were seen when the two organisms were compared. These have been discussed in terms of differences in the regulation of their respective septal growth sites and basic mechanisms of wall assembly and modification.",W1520508988,False,0.22620265185832977

We suggest that this extent of complementarity between the mRNA and this extent of complementarity between the mRNA and the ribosome may be a requirement for efficient initiation by Bacillus subtilis and other Gram-positive ribosomes, and may provide the basis for the observed inability of the Gram-positive systems to translate most of the mRNAs from Gram-negative bacteria.",W123626623,False,0.0011258043814450502

Alternative pathway capacity correlated negatively with [rho]cyt, with [rho]cyt values of less than 1.0 occurring in tissues in which the alternative pathway capacity was greater than 25 to 30% of total respiration. The species that did not show full engagement of the cytochrome pathway rarely exhibited SHAM inhibition in the absence of KCN.

A pathway's contribution is equal to the activity when the other branch is blocked by an inhibitor multiplied by the degree (0‐1.0) to which this activity is engaged when both pathways are operating. According to Bahr and Bonner (1973. J. Biol. Chem. 218: 3441–3445) the plot of the activities of identical titrations, one performed in the absence and the other in the presence of a specific inhibitor of the other branch of the respiratory chain, yields a straight line whose slope indicates the engagement of the titrated pathway during uninhibited respiration. An initial slope of zero may occur if electron flux is diverted between pathways during titrations. However, beyond the breakpoint (representing the point of pathway saturation), a straight line is obtained with a slope representing engagement. This technique assumes that the kinetics of inhibiting a specific component of the respiratory chain are independent of the absolute rate of electron flux through the total pathway. To test this assumption, the activity of respiratory pathways in isolated soybean ( Glycine max [L]. Merr. cv. Stevens) mitochondria was titrated with specific inhibitors of the cytochrome and alternative oxidases. Under these conditions, the electron flux through a given pathway was manipulated by poising the rate of succinate oxidation with the succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor malonate. Construction of activity plots in the presence versus absence of malonate failed to result in straight lines for either KCN (when titrating the cytochrome pathway) or salicylhydroxamic acid (when titrating the alternative pathway). Rather, the resultant plots were always curvilinear whenever the activity in the presence of malonate divided by the activity in the absence of malonate was less than 1.0. In no case could the real engagement of the pathway be precisely estimated from the titration data. Titrations of cytochrome pathway activity in isolated potato tuber ( Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Sabago and Canabex) mitochondria (which lack the alternative oxidase) showed that as the inhibitor concentration was increased, so did the reduction status of the ubiquinone pool, to a new steady state. The dependence of inhibition kinetics on the rate of flux through the pathway, and the increase in ubiquinone pool reduction upon KCN addition, are explained in terms of the elasticity of component enzymes as outlined in the theory of metabolic control analysis. The implications of this finding for the use of titrations to estimate engagement of plant respiratory pathways are discussed.",W1967876118,False,0.16996121406555176

The quantum efficiency for electron transport in unchilled leaves was similar to that previously observed in C3 plants, although maize has two types of chloroplasts, mesophyll and bundle sheath, with PSII being largely absent from the latter. The index of noncyclic electron transport was proportional to the CO2 assimilation rate. Chilled leaves showed decreased rates of CO2 assimilation relative to unchilled leaves, but the integral relationships between the quantum efficiency for electron transport or the index of noncyclic electron transport and CO2 fixation were unchanged and there was no photoinhibition. The maximum catalytic activities of the Benson-Calvin cycle enzymes, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, were decreased following chilling, but activation was unaffected. Measurements of thiol-regulated enzymes, particularly NADP-malate dehydrogenase, indicated that chilling induced changes in the stromal redox state so that reducing equivalents were more plentiful.

Plants were grown at 250 μ mol quanta m –2 s –1 under two temperature conditions, 15 and 30 °C. The optimal temperature that maximizes the light‐saturated rate of photosynthesis at 350 μ L L –1 CO 2 was found to be 20–25 and 30–35 °C for leaves grown at 15 and 30 °C, respectively. We focused on two processes, carboxylation and regeneration of ribulose‐1,5‐bisphosphate (RuBP), which potentially limit photosynthetic rates. Because the former process is known to limit photosynthesis at lower CO 2 concentrations while the latter limits it at higher CO 2 concentrations, we determined the temperature dependence of the photosynthetic rate at 200 and 1000 μ L L –1 CO 2 under saturated light. It was revealed that the temperature dependence of both processes varied depending on the growth temperature. Using a biochemical model, we estimated the capacity of the two processes at various temperatures under ambient CO 2 concentration. It was suggested that, in leaves grown at low temperature (15 °C), the photosynthetic rate was limited solely by RuBP carboxylation under any temperature. On the other hand, it was suggested that, in leaves grown at high temperature (30 °C), the photosynthetic rate was limited by RuBP regeneration below 22 °C, but limited by RuBP carboxylation above 22 °C. We concluded that: (1) the changes in the temperature dependence of carboxylation and regeneration of RuBP and (2) the changes in the balance of these two processes altered the temperature dependence of the photosynthetic rate.",W1986530884,False,0.7565268874168396

A conceptual hydrologic model is proposed to describe the flow of fluids through these rocks. Thickness of the unsaturated zone is about 500 to 750 meters and consists of three welded units interlayered with two nonwelded units. Compared to nonwelded units, welded units have low matrix porosities and permeabilities, high fracture densities, and high bulk hydraulic conductivities. The principal repository area is bounded by normal fault zones. Of the average annual precipitation of 150 millimeters per year, 0.5 to 4.5 millimeters per year becomes net infiltration. Percolation through the matrix of the welded units is principally vertical and is less than 1 millimeter per year. Percolation through nonwelded units occurs both vertically and laterally and has variable rates (0.1 to 100 millimeters per year). Fracture flow is predominant in the uppermost welded unit during intense pulses of infiltration, but is insignificant in the welded unit that forms the potential host rock. Lateral flow in the upper nonwelded unit, enhanced by existence of a capillary barrier, probably is the factor controlling the low fluxes in the host rock and relatively high fluxes in the structural features.

https://doi.org/10.2307/2390280,Exploitation of environmental Hetergeneity by Spatial Division of Labor in a Clonal Plant,"1. The economic principle of spatial division of labour comprises two basic features, specialization in the performance of specific tasks and close co-operation by potentially independent, spatially separated subunits of a higher-level organizational system. Space-economic theory predicts large benefits from such a spatial division of labour if essential resources are heterogeneously distributed and if high-availability zones for these resources do not spatially coincide. In this paper, evidence is provided that a spatial division of labour may also occur in clonal plants growing in spatially heterogeneous environments. 2. Clonal fragments of the stoloniferous herb Trifolium repens L., consisting of two interconnected groups of ramets, were exposed to contrasting levels of light and water supply. Ramet groups specialized morphologically in the uptake of the locally most abundant resource and they exchanged both water and assimilates. This division of labour significantly increased the performance of the entire plant in terms of fitness-related traits such as biomass and atonal offspring production. 3. It is concluded that spatial division of labour may contribute to the apparent success of clonal plant species in many natural habitats by enabling them to efficiently exploit environmental patchiness. The implications of these results for the understanding of foraging strategies of clonal plants and the general notion of habitat heterogeneity in plant ecology are discussed.",W1723682541,False,0.8115300536155701

The morphological responses of the root system were tested by assessing scale (represented by root mass and root length densities), precision (preferential proliferation of roots in nutrient‐rich patches compared with less fertile patches) and discrimination (ability to detect and proliferate within the richest patches when patches vary in nutrient concentration). We also investigated sensitivity (growth benefits gained as spatial heterogeneity of nutrients increases, measured as total biomass). 2 Ten individuals of each species were grown in pots under four treatments that had differing nutrient distribution but the same overall nutrient addition. Plants were harvested when roots reached pot edge. 3 We observed high variation between species in scale, precision and sensitivity. No significant discrimination responses were observed, although greatest root mass density occurred at intermediate fertility levels for all species. 4 We rejected the hypothesis that scale and precision are negatively correlated. Indeed, in herbaceous species alone, scale and precision were positively correlated. 5 Sensitivity was not closely related to precision, indicating that proliferation of roots in fertile patches does not always yield growth benefits in heterogeneous soils. Further, some sensitive species had very low precision, suggesting that a positive growth response in heterogeneous environments may be related to plasticity in physiology or root life span, rather than morphology. 6 Plant life form was not correlated with precision or sensitivity. However, scale of response was greater in herbs than in woody plants, possibly because the two life forms develop root systems at different rates.",W1966273421,False,0.8802953958511353

Over the 5—yr period of this study 77% of all plants were browsed by ungulate herbivores at some time during the flowering season. Of these, 33% were subsequently browsed. Removal of the single inflorescence stimulated the production of, on average, five new flowering stalks from dormant lateral buds along the remaining portion of the plant's stem. Although regrowth shoots were initially avoided by ungulates following the removal of scarlets gilia's single inflorenscence, plant types were secondarily browsed following stem elongation and flower bud formation. Secondary herbivory had no effect on the compensatory outcome. Plants that were naturally browsed produced significantly higher numbers of flowers and fruits than plants that were not eaten, even when plants were secondarily browsed. Because there were no significant differences in numbers of seeds produced per fruit or in seed mass, an increase in total fruits produced by browsed plants resulted in an increase in fitness through seed production. Observational and experimental results indicate that I. aggregata switches from a ""mutualistic"" to an ""antagonistic"" interaction with its ungulate herbivores in order to achieve its greatest fitness. Results of experimental clipping showed that high levels of secondary herbivory on I. aggregata would be detrimental, decreased fitness by °70%. An apparent change in plant quality following the initial bout of herbivory, however, deters high levels of subsequent herbivory, restricting tissue removal to the tips of the plant. When plants were found in close association with either pine or grasses (to add in the potential negative effects of competition), browsed plants still outperformed control plants, producing significantly more flowers and fruits than uneaten control plants. As in a previous study, these results support the contention that mammalian herbivores can benefit plants enhancing plant fitness.",W1982449639,False,0.8952488899230957

(2) Although Gastrophysa viridula feeds on both Rumex obtusifolius and Rumex crispus in the field, the preference is for R. obtusifolius. (3) Moderate levels of grazing or clipping had no significant effects on plants of either species when competing intraspecifically. (4) In the conditions of the experiments, R. obtusifolius grew better when competing interspecifically with R. crispus than when competing intraspecifically, whilst the reverse was found for R. crispus. (5) This advantage of R. obtusifolius was removed by moderate levels of clipping or grazing. Clipping removed the competitive disadvantage of R. crispus but moderate grazing enhanced it. (6) Heavy grazing significantly reduced leaf area, leaf dry weight, root dry weight and whole plant dry weight of R. obtusifolius and R. crispus grown alone. (7) Rumex obtusifolius responded to heavy grazing by an increase in the root: shoot ratio, whereas R. crispus responded by a decrease in this ratio. (8) There was a significant interference interaction between interspecific competition and heavy grazing in R. crispus. This was especially marked below ground. (9) The possible relevance of these findings to observations on the distribution of the two Rumex species in the field is discussed. It is concluded that there may be circumstances in which grazing by Gastrophysa viridula may affect the distribution of Rumex crispus, and that this is more likely to be the case if it is growing in the presence of R. obtusifolius.",W2009813912,False,0.8568264842033386

Both Plantago and Buddleia species are known to contain aucubin. The concentrations of this glycoside and catalpol are comparable in Plantago. In Buddleia methylcatalpol predominates somewhat over catalpol. Yields of the individual glycosides were about 0.1% of the fresh weight of the leaves. 4.

Die für die biologische Bekämpfung von Forstschädlingen wichtigste Art ist F. polyctena (Foerst.). Die Art ist poly‐gyn, sehr widerstandsfähig und bildet große Kolonien mit zahlreichen Nest‐ablegern. Die Außentemperatur hat eine große Bedeutung für die Aktivität der Ameisen. Bei Temperaturen miter 20° C sinkt die Aktivität stark ab. Das Jagdterritorium eines Ameisennestes ist nicht größer als 0.5 Hektar. Zum völligen Schutz eines Waldgebietes müssen künstliche Nester im 50‐m‐Verband angelegt werden (=4 Nester per Hektar). Formica polyctena verlegt ihre Nester gern an sonnige Waldränder. Eine erfolgreiche Kolonisierung dieser Art kann deshalb nur in Kiefernwäldern stattfinden, wo das Licht einigermaßen gleichmäßig zum Waldboden vor‐dringen kann. Nur ein kleiner Teil der normalen Ameisennahrung besteht aus Schad‐insekten. Während starker Schädlingsgradationen spezialisieren sich die Ameisen in der Jagd auf die Schädlingsart. Die Ameisen bevorzugen Schmet‐terlingslarven, und in einigen Fällen greifen sie auch die Puppen an. Blatt‐wespenlarven werden seltener eingebracht und Käfer fast nie angegriffen. Einige Entomologen weisen den Wert der Roten Waldameise als Prädator völlig zurück. Sie stellten fest, daß die Ameisen normalerweise von Honigtau und nur selten von Insekten leben. Rote Waldameisen verbreiten Samen und regen das Pflanzenwachstum durch Bodenmelioration an. Dies ist gewöhnlich von waldbaulichem Nutzen, in manchen Fällen kann es jedoch auch nachteilige Folgen haben. Rote Waldameisen leben in Trophobiose mit vielen pflanzensaugenden Insekten (Aphidae, Coccidae, Psyllidae). Sie beschützen diese Insekten gegen Prädatoren und Parasiten. In einigen Fällen können die so geschützten Schäd‐linge Schädigungen der Wirtspflanze hervorrufen. Dies ist besonders bei Schizodryobius exsiccator (Htg.), einem wichtigen Buchenschädling, der Fall. Zuwachsverluste und außergewöhnlicher Befall durch Sekundärschädlinge wurde an Bäumen beobachtet, die starke, durch Ameisen geschützte Aphiden‐populationen trugen. Rote Waldameisen haben auch einen schädlichen Einfluß auf Nutzinsek‐ten. Die Insektennahrung der Ameisen kann aus 15‐20% nützlicher Insekten (Parasiten, Prädatoren) bestehen. In mehreren Fällen zeigten genaue Untersuchungen, daß Parasiten durch die Waldameisen ebenso reduziert wurden wie ihre Wirte. Auf Grund der ökologischen, günstigen Bedingungen finden wir die Ameisen besonders häufig in Kiefernwäldern, und bei der Mehrheit der Insekten, die durch die Ameisen angegriffen werden, handelt es sich deshalb auch um Kieferninsekten. In folgender Liste sind die Insektenarten zusammengefaßt, gegen die Waldameisen mchr oder weniger wirksam gewesen sein sollen: Bei einer objektiven Analyse aller veröffentlichten Informationen er‐scheint nur ein einziger Fall vorzuliegen, wo die Ameisen einen wirklichen Wert bei der Niederhaltung eines Schadinsekts haben. Dies ist bei Panolis flammea (Schiff.) gegeben. Die Beobachtungen über alle anderen in der Liste genannten Insekten sind entweder widersprechend oder wenig überzeugend. Immerhin kann angenommen werden, daß Rote Waldameisen (nur F. polyc‐tena!) einen gewissen, begrenzten Nutzwert in Kiefernwäldern haben. Eine Ansiedlung von Ameisen in Fichtenwäldern erscheint nutzlos und in Laub‐holzbeständen, besonders bei Buchenanteil, wegen der Schutzwirkung gegen‐über schädlichen Pflanzensaugern gefährlich.",W1965545830,False,0.42422357201576233

The review also concerns the mimicing of plant effector molecules like auxins, gibberellins and abscisic acid by fungal secondary metabolites that modulate plant growth or even can subvert the plant defense responses such as programmed cell death to gain nutrients for fungal growth and colonization.

Using phylogenetic and functional trait information, we tested whether arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal community composition in an old field was influenced by competitive exclusion and/or environmental filtering. Communities at the site were dominated by species from the most speciose family of AM fungi, the Glomeraceae, though species from two other lineages, the Acaulosporaceae and Gigasporaceae were also found. Despite the dominance of species from a single family, AM fungal species most frequently co-existed when they were distantly related and when they differed in the ability to colonize root space on host plants. The ability of AM fungal species to colonize soil did not influence co-existence. These results suggest that competition between closely related and functionally similar species for space on plant roots influences community assembly. Nevertheless, in a substantial minority of cases communities were phylogenetically clustered, indicating that closely related species could also co-occur, as would be expected if i) the environment restricted community membership to single functional type or ii) competition among functionally similar species was weak. Our results therefore also suggest that competition for niche space between closely related fungi is not the sole influence of mycorrhizal community structure in field situations, but may be of greater relative importance than other ecological mechanisms.",W1968683222,False,0.8878222703933716

Their size has rendered them difficult, if not impossible, to study in their entirety; there have been few full revisions since the nineteenth century. Despite their embodiment of significant taxonomic, biological and evolutionary questions, from the 1980s their importance has been more generally recognised, and recent technological and methodological developments have made it easier to come to grips with their study. This paper synthesizes growth impediments to our knowledge of these genera and possible approaches to studying them. Of the 57 genera currently thought to have 500 or more species, 22 of these were also considered in 1883 to be large (300 or more species). Others gained their prominence as a result of later exploration, some of it driven by enthusiasts. It is argued that comparisons of size, phenomena, and processes will only be possible by comprehensive study of the lineages comprising these genera and their immediate historical relatives; uncritical lists or relatively limited samples are not enough. Such studies will be of great scientific as well as cultural benefit.",W1970042452,False,0.5264194011688232

The nucleic acids isolated were not digested by RNase A, but were digested by DNase I and exonuclease III, indicating that they were double-stranded DNA. On the basis of the restriction endonuclease digestion patterns on 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis, the length of c-st, c-n71, c-468, and c-d6f phage DNAs was estimated to be about 110 kilobase pairs and that of c-203 and d-1873 was about 150 kilobase pairs. The digestion patterns of c-st, c-468, and c-n71 phage DNAs by PstI and HindIII were very similar. High homology was observed in the dot hybridization test. For other phages and nucleases, a good similarity was not observed. Only a little similarity was observed between c-203 and c-d6f phages. The existence of the structural genes for the toxin in both c-st and c-n71 phages was confirmed by the hybridization test with these phage DNAs and the oligonucleotide probe which represented the DNA sequence predicted for the N-terminal amino acids (2 to 17) of C. botulinum type C toxin. The loss of the converting ability of c-n71 phage may be caused not by the deletion of the tox+ gene but rather by the base mutation in c-st phage DNA.",W1499871537,False,0.0013816653518006206

https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v007.i10,<b>zt</b>: A Software Tool for Simple and Partial Mantel Tests,"Different methods of data analysis (e.g. clustering and ordination) are based on distance matrices. In some cases, researchers may wish to compare several distance matrices with one another in order to test a hypothesis concerning a possible relationship between these matrices. However, this is not always self-evident. Usually, values in distance matrices are, in some way, correlated and therefore the usual assumption of independence between objects is violated in the classical tests approach. Furthermore, often, spurious correlations can be observed when comparing two distances matrices. A classic example is the comparison between genetic and environmental distances. Colonies that are in close proximity of each other tend to have similar environments and therefore there will be a positive correlation between environmental and geographical distances. Such colonies will also be more likely to exchange migrants so that genetic distances will be positively correlated with spatial distances. The consequence is that an observed positive association between genetic and environmental distances may be simply due to spatial effects. The most widely used method to account for distance correlations is a procedure known as the Mantel test (Mantel, 1967; Mantel and Valand, 1970 following the pioneering work of Daniels, 1944 ; Daniels and Kendall 1947). The simple Mantel test considers two matrices while an extension known as the partial Mantel test considers three matrices.

A. alternata is a frequently occurring species of particular interest because it produces a number of mycotoxins, including alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), altenuene (ALT), altertoxins I, II, and III (ATX-I, -II, and -III), and L-tenuazonic acid (TeA). Cleanup procedures of analytical methods for foods and foodstuffs include solvent partition, generally used for TeA, and solid-phase extraction columns for AOH, AME, and ATX-I. These Alternaria mycotoxins have been determined by TLC, GC, and more usually LC, mainly with ultraviolet detection, although fluorescence and electrochemical detection have also been used for Alternaria toxins other than TeA. A Zn2+ salt is usually added to the LC mobile phase for TeA. Recently, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and electrospray LC/MS and LC–MS/MS have been applied to the determination and confirmation of AOH and AME in apple juice and other fruit beverages at sub ng/mL levels. Natural occurrences of AOH, AME, and in some cases other Alternaria toxins have been reported in various fruits, including tomatoes, olives, mandarins, melons, peppers, apples, and raspberries. They have been found also in processed fruit products such as apple juice, other fruit beverages and tomato products, wheat and other grains, sunflower seeds, oilseed rape meal, and pecans.",W122361370,False,0.604799747467041

Residual activity in a pgn1 mutant (lacking endoPG) was due to exoPG activity, and the responsible protein has now been purified. After chemical deglycosylation, the molecular mass of the purified protein decreased from greater than 60 to 45 kDa. The gene that encodes exoPG, PGX1, was isolated with PCR primers based on peptide sequences from the protein. The product of PGX1, Pgx1p, has a predicted molecular mass of 48 kDa, 12 potential N-glycosylation sites, and 61% amino acid identity to an exoPG from the saprophytic fungus Aspergillus tubingensis. Strains of C. carbonum mutated in PGX1 were constructed by targeted gene disruption and by gene replacement. Growth of pgx1 mutant strains on pectin was reduced by ca. 20%, and they were still pathogenic on maize. A double pgn1/pgx1 mutant strain was constructed by crossing. The double mutant grew as well as the pgx1 single mutant on pectin and was still pathogenic despite having less than 1% of total wild-type PG activity. Double mutants retained a small amount of PG activity with the same cation-exchange retention time as Pgn1p and also pectin methylesterase and a PG activity associated with the mycelium. Continued growth of the pgn1/pgx1 mutant on pectin could be due to one or more of these residual activities.",W1486252090,False,0.08411545306444168

The toxigenicity of Alternaria strains isolated from olives and the possible mycotoxin transfer into the oil have also been investigated. Four out of 13 olive samples were contaminated by 2 to 4 Alternaria mycotoxins. The highest contamination was found in a badly damaged sample containing 2.9, 2.3, 1.4 and 0.3 mg/kg of AME, AOH, ALT and ATX‐I, respectively. No mycotoxins were detected in olive‐oil destined for human consumption (6 samples) or olive‐husks (3 samples) collected from oil‐mills after the first pressing of olives. An oil sample produced in our laboratory by processing the most contaminated olive sample contained AOH (0.79 mg/kg) and AME (0.29 mg/kg). The estimated mycotoxin amount transferred into the oil was 4% for AME, 1.8% for AOH, and zero for ALT and TA (considering 15% the oil yield). Although Alternaria species, mostly A. alternata (Fr.) Keissler, were present at various extent on all the examined olive samples, mycotoxins were only detected in samples of physically damaged olives. The production of mycotoxins by A. alternata isolated from olives was much higher (up to 3 order of magnitude for TA) on rice cultures than on olive cultures.",W2006977761,False,0.48046159744262695

We consider species in which the juveniles only compete with other juveniles, and the adults only compete with other adults, i.e. juveniles and adults of either species do not compete. This is typical of amphibians where juveniles (tadpoles) live in water and adults (frogs) live on land. Assuming competition efficiencies of the two species are similar, we analyse the cases where reproduction is either continuous or seasonal. In both cases, we develop conditions on the invasion net reproductive numbers of the two species that will lead to competitive exclusion.

In many cases, especially when classes are defined by a continuous variable, such as length or mass, there are no natural breakpoints, and the division is artificial. We introduce the ""integral projection model,"" which eliminates the need for division into discrete classes, without requiring any additional biological assumptions. Like a traditional matrix model, the integral projection model provides estimates of the asymptotic growth rate, stable size distribution, reproductive values, and sensitivities of the growth rate to changes in vital rates. However, where the matrix model represents the size distributions, reproductive value, and sensitivities as step functions (constant within a stage class), the integral projection model yields smooth curves for each of these as a function of individual size. We describe a method for fitting the model to data, and we apply this method to data on an endangered plant species, northern monkshood (Aconitum noveboracense), with individuals classified by stem diameter. The matrix and integral models yield similar estimates of the asymptotic growth rate, but the reproductive values and sensitivities in the matrix model are sensitive to the choice of stage classes. The integral projection model avoids this problem and yields size-specific sensitivities that are not affected by stage duration. These general properties of the integral projection model will make it advantageous for other populations where there is no natural division of individuals into stage classes.",W1971842859,False,0.7391164898872375

https://doi.org/10.2981/wlb.2001.018,Optimal and suboptimal use of compensatory responses to harvesting: timing of hunting as an example,"The sustainability of exploitation is based on density‐dependent renewal of populations: when population density decreases as some individuals are taken, the remaining individuals compensate by surviving or reproducing better. In general there is a trade‐off between two desired outcomes: a high yield and a high remaining population size. A hunting strategy is Pareto optimal if it balances this trade‐off without wasting possibilities of improving the performance in either aspect. Lack of knowledge concerning the age structure, mating system or density dependence operating in a population will very easily cause suboptimality in this sense, whereas utilising knowledge of density dependence may, in some cases, even overcome the conflict between the goals, so that harvesting can increase rather than decrease population sizes. Suboptimal timing of harvesting is an example which not only causes unnecessary harm to a population, but also hampers estimation of the compensatory or additive nature of mortality. A bias towards additivity will be found if hunting and natural mortality overlap in time, and even ‘superadditive’ results are possible. A mortality pattern that appears additive cannot, therefore, be used to deduce that overwinter survival is density independent. These results have consequences to harvest planning. Adjusting the length of the open season is a tool frequently used to regulate the harvest. Since estimated slopes of compensation cannot be assumed to remain constant if the timing of the open season is changed, the effect of a prolonged season will be more drastic than a mere change in kill rates would predict. Such factors are likely to have the strongest effects in species with long harvest seasons, such as many migratory European waterfowl.",W1495992226,False,0.7919508814811707
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0021-8790.2004.00859.x,Population responses to perturbations: predictions and responses from laboratory mite populations,"Summary Mathematical models are frequently used to make predictions of the response of a population to management interventions or environmental perturbations, but it is rarely possible to make controlled or replicated tests of the accuracy of these predictions. We report results from replicated laboratory experiments on populations of a soil mite, Sancassania berlesei, living in ‘constant’ or ‘variable’ environments. We experimentally perturbed vital rates, via selective harvesting, and examined the population‐level responses. The response depends on the stage manipulated and whether there is environmental variability. Increased mortality usually decreased population size and increased population variability. However, egg mortality in a variable environment increased total population size. We used time‐series analysis to construct a stage‐based population model of this system, incorporating the responses to both density and variation in food supply. The time‐series model qualitatively captures the population dynamics, but does not predict well the way the populations will respond to the change in mortality. Elasticity analysis, conducted on the model's output, therefore did not lead to accurate predictions. The presence of indirect positive population effects of a negative perturbation, but only in a variable environment, suggests that predicting the population response will require the incorporation of density dependence and environmental stochasticity. That the considerable biological complexity of our time‐series model did not allow accurate predictions suggests that accurate prediction requires modelling processes within a stage class rather than trying to make do with simple functions of total density.",W1498361560,False,0.635258674621582

,The systematic formulation of tractable single-species models incorporating age structure,"(1) We develop a mathematically rigorous approach to modelling the effects of age structure, in which the life-history of a species is divided into age classes of arbitrary duration and attention is focused on the sub-populations of the various classes. (2) By assuming that all individuals in a particular age class have the same birth and death rates (which may be time- and density-dependent), we reduce the normal integro-differential equations describing an age-structured population with overlapping generations to a set of coupled ordinary delay-differential equations which are readily integrated numerically. (3) We illustrate the use of the formalism in the construction and analysis of two models of laboratory insect populations: a detailed model of Nicholson's blowflies and a `strategic' model of larval competition intended to refine the design of experiments in progress on the dynamics of the Indian meal-moth Plodia interpunctella (Hubner). (4) The model of Nicholson's blowflies is dynamically identical to a model previously derived heuristically. We have fitted the parameters using a more comprehensive range of data, and have illustrated explicitly the passage of large, quasi-cyclic fluctuations through the age structure. (5) We use the larval competition model to distinguish the effects of `uniform competition' (all larvae competing) and `cohort competition' (larvae of a given age competing). The former can produce quasi-cycles of a type characteristic of delayed regulation, while the latter causes quasi-cycles consisting of `bursts' of population propagating through the age structure. (6) We also use the larval competition model to demonstrate that apparently minor changes in the description of adult survival can induce dramatic alterations in model behaviour. This supports our emphasis on rigour in the formulation of the model, so as to distinguish genuinely interesting dynamics from mathematical artifacts.",W112335175,False,0.08185944706201553

The method was also applied to one example of a two-dimensional thin plate smoothing spline.

,"Female choice, conflict between the sexes and the evolution of male alternative reproductive behaviours","The importance of conflict between the sexes has recently been recognized as a driving force in the evolution of mating systems and reproductive behaviour. Past theory on the evolution of alternative reproductive strategies focused primarily on interactions within a single sex. These interactions can generate frequency- and condition-dependent fitness, which maintain the stable co-existence of alternative reproductive behaviours. We argue that interactions between the sexes (such as female choice and intersexual conflict) are a common but ignored mechanism that will influence the evolution of male alternative reproductive behaviours. Using a modelling approach that links dynamic games, we examine the influence of female choice on the stability and expression of male alternatives. By modelling five different biological scenarios, we show that female choice can suppress the existence of male alternative reproductive behaviours even when frequency- or condition-dependent mechanisms alone would predict their stable co-existence. Furthermore, we find that variation in female choice can lead to the stable coexistence of male alternative reproductive behaviours in the absence of traditional mechanisms known to allow the evolution of reproductive alternatives.",W1199247826,False,0.07005123049020767

By building up lipids, it can survive periods with low food, and gain reproductive success the following season by transforming fat to eggs. Also, copepods face a trade-off between survival and growth, as surface waters generally are more risky and productive than the dark refuges at greater depths, both in the diel and annual temporal scale. Implicit in these trade-offs are the numbers of generations, population dynamics and productive potential of the copepod. The authors develop a model which is used to investigate (1) how optimal diel arid ontogenetic vertical migration might vary with season, individual state (size and lipid reserves) and growth conditions; (2) whether fat is mainly used for overwintering or for fueling reproduction in early spring; and (3) the adaptive value of behavioural flexibility in migration patterns. The model suggests an explanation for observations of absence of vertical migration during spring bloom and before descent to overwintering, and it suggests 1–2 successful generations per year in its basic version. It shows that migratory strategies are not similar between stages and strongly depend on the level of accumulated reserves, that the risk of predation can affect growth, distribution and number of generations and that one should expect phenotypic plasticity in DVM patterns. The model is very sensitive to the rate of metabolism during dormancy.

This review attempts to quantify the population dynamic consequences of this behavior by developing simple mathematical models for the most frequently recorded of such parasite life cycles. Although changes in the behavior of infected hosts do occur for pathogens with direct life cycles, they are most commonly recorded in the intermediate hosts of parasites with complex life cycles. All the changes in host behavior serve to increase rates of transmission of the parasites between hosts. In the simplest case the changes in behavior increase rates of contact between infected and susceptible conspecific hosts, whereas in the more complex cases fairly sophisticated manipulations of the host's behavioral repertory are achieved. Three topics are dealt with in some detail: (1) the behavior of the insect vectors of such diseases as malaria and trypanosomiasis; (2) the intermediate hosts of helminths whose behavior is affected in such a way as to make them more susceptible to predation by the definitive host in the life cycle; and (3) the behavior and fecundity of molluscs infected with asexually reproducing parasitic flatworms. In each case an expression is derived for Ro, the basic reproductive rate of the parasite when first introduced into the population. This is used to determine the threshold numbers of definitive and intermediate hosts needed to maintain a population of the pathogen. In all cases, parasiteinduced changes in host behavior tend to increase Ro and reduce the threshold number of hosts required to sustain the infection. The population dynamics of the interaction between parasites and their are then explored using phase plane analyses. This suggests that both the parasite and intermediate host populations may show oscillatory patterns of abundance. When the density of the latter is low, parasite-induced changes in host behavior increase this tendency to oscillate. When intermediate host population densities are high, parasite population density is determined principally by interactions between the parasites and their definitive hosts, and changes in the behavior of intermediate hosts are less important in determining parasite density. Analysis of these models also suggests that both asexual reproduction of the parasite within a host and parasite-induced reduction in host fecundity may be stabilizing mechanisms when they occur in the intermediate hosts of parasite species with indirect life cycles. This contrasts with the case for a direct life cycle parasite where parasite-induced reductions in host fecundity and asexual reproduction are always destabilizing. The Consequences of these different patterns of dynamic interaction are discussed in terms of the evolution of complex life cycles in parasitic helminths and the intensity with which modification of host behavior should be expressed in different habitats. Although the available data tend to support the conclusions of the models, the whole area would benefit considerably from futher detailed field studies of specific parasite-host systems.",W1979041167,False,0.7822881937026978

Evolution of a population's mean growth trajectory is governed by the selection gradient function and the additive genetic covariance function. The selection gradient function is determined by the impact of changes in size on the birth and death rates at different ages, and can be estimated for natural populations. The additive genetic covariance function can also be estimated empirically, as we demonstrate with four vertebrate populations. Using the genetic data from mice, a computer simulation shows that evolution of a growth trajectory can be constrained by the absence of genetic variation for certain changes in the trajectory's shape. These constraints can be visualized with an analysis of the covariance function. Results from four vertebrate populations show that while each has substantial genetic variation for some evolutionary changes in its growth trajectory, most types of changes have little or no variation available. This suggests that constraints may often play an important role in the evolution of growth.",W1982830832,False,0.15014806389808655

The results disclosed that the amounts and proportions of volatile acids formed could vary widely. In one case, a marked difference in the proportions of the acids produced arose within the experiment and correlated with a difference in the proportion of methane formed. The average rate of production per day was 10.5 moles butyric acid, 12.8 moles propionic acid, and 40 moles acetic acid. Manometric estimations of rate gave lower results than those obtained by the zero-time method, due to delay after sampling and to failure of the acids to liberate stoichiometric quantities of carbon dioxide. For those experiments in which zero-time rates were estimated, the average specific absorption rates, i.e., the amount absorbed per hour per micromole of acid in the rumen, were 0.37 for butyric acid, 0.38 for propionic acid, and 0.26 for acetic acid.

The in vitro fermentation of dried grass yields the same three acids, but with acetic acid predominating. Members of the genus Propionibacterium have been isolated from the rumen, and evidence is presented to show that these organisms are responsible for the production of the propionic acid found in the rumen.

https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4684-7671-2_9,The Relationship Between Ingestion Rate of Deposit Feeders and Sediment Nutritional Value,"Food resources of marine deposit feeders have been a subject of intense investigation for many years, but it has been only recently that some of the details have become apparent. Two general hypotheses have dominated research in this field: first, non-living organic carbon including detritus cannot be utilized directly by deposit feeders, but must first he transformed into microbial biomass by bacteria, fungi, and other microbes; and second, the resulting microbial biomass represents a major food resource for the deposit feeders (for example, Newell 1965; Fenchel 1970; Hargrave 1976; Lopez et al, 1977; Gerlach 1978). These two hypotheses are by no means independent and each has been used to support the other. However, as I have pointed out previously (Canunen 1980a), in order to evaluate the importance of a potential food resource it is necessary to consider both the rate at which it is ingested and the efficiency with which it is assimilated. In terms of nonliving organic carbon, we have an abundance of data for deposit feeders on ingestion rates (Canunen 1980b), but very little quantitative data on assimilation efficiencies; the situation for microbial carbon is exactly the inverse, with numerous studies of deposit feeder assimilation efficiencies (for example, Zhukhova 1963; Hargrave 1970; Kofoed 1975; Yingst 1976; Lopez et al. 1977; Cammen 1980a), but very few of ingestion rates (Wetzel 1977; Jensen and Siegismund 1980; Canunen 1980a). Yet, somehow the qualitative data showing that assimilation efficiency is generally low for non-living organic carbon or detritus and the data showing high assimilation efficiencies for microbes have been combined to suggest that the major food source for marine deposit feeders must be the microbes—the information on ingestion rates has been largely ignored. Recently, however, several studies have taken into account the ingestion rates of microbes by the deposit feeders (Wetzel 1977; concluded that bacteria can be only of minor importance in the carbon budgets of the animals. In fact, no one has ever shown that any deposit feeder uses bacteria for a major fraction of its nutritional requirements. Thus, the question of how much non-living organic matter contributes to deposit feeder nutrition has become much more important. Unfortunately, it is a difficult question to address since the high ingestion rates make even a low assimilation efficiency significant (Cammen 1980a; Levinton 1980) and with current methods we cannot measure a low assimilation efficiency with any degree of accuracy.",W1529373663,False,0.7574845552444458

Ingestive and processing behaviors compensate to maintain DE/T as the environment changes. Compensation for a change in forage density is more complete than for a change in forage quality. Ingestive behaviors alone have limited ability to offset environmental changes, and control of passage rate through processing behaviors is an important additional compensatory mechanism. Optimal solutions of the model maintain a high intake by sacrificing diet quality and maintain a high rate of passage by increasing mastication and rumination effort when eating low-quality diets. When the model is scaled to body size, decreases in body size lead to higher selectivity and more pronounced processing behaviors. In no case are optimal solutions characterized by less than maximum rumen fill. The model predicts that the small ruminant derives an increasing proportion of its energy from the cell contents. The model suggests that selection for production has produced plastic ingestive and processing behaviors and has increased body size.",W135733697,False,0.5455470085144043

An assessment of radiation quantity and soil volume,"We conducted two experiments to investigate the expression of shade avoidance in response to low ratios of red to far‐red irradiation (R∶FR) in the C 4 perennial grass Schizachyrium scoparium at two levels of above‐ground (photosynthetic photon flux density (PFD) 400–700 nm) and below‐ground (soil volume) resource availability and in plants of two ages. Young plants showed greater sheath and ramet height in response to low R∶FR and old plants showed reduced ramet initiation in experiments one and two, respectively, but both responses were not expressed simultaneously in either group. Growth of all ramet variables, including ramet initiation, was suppressed in small as opposed to large soil volumes. By contrast, architectural variables, but not ramet initiation, were greater for plants grown in low as opposed to ambient PFD. However, expression of shade avoidance to low R∶FR was not significantly affected by either level of PFD or soil volume. We must conclude that the levels of resource availability provided do not modulate shade avoidance in this perennial grass. These results demonstrate that S. scoparium is capable of expressing shade avoidance in response to low R∶FR, but inconsistent juvenile ramet initiation and architectural responses in plants of different ages and phenological stages of development indicate that the shade avoidance response might not be expressed consistently throughout the life of plants.",W1561583357,False,0.8723461031913757

,A method for testing the assumption of phylogenetic independence in comparative data,"When making a comparison between two or more traits across taxa, the assumption of phylogenetic independence must be tested. Empirically determining the validity of this assumption before and after applying a phylogenetically based comparative method (PCM) can provide researchers with a rigorous methodological approach for analysing comparative data. This approach can help resolve current debates regarding whether it is always appropriate to apply a PCM, and whether PCMs are in fact successful in accounting for all of the historical non-independence in comparative data. To use this methodological approach, however, a generally applicable statistical diagnostic that can test the assumption of phylogenetic independence in comparative data is required. In this context, I present the application of a statistical diagnostic called the ‘test for serial independence’. This diagnostic can be applied to almost all currently employed PCMs, including Felsenstein’s (1985) independent contrasts. Furthermore, I demonstrate the application of the test for serial independence by analysing three data sets from the literature. The results of these analyses show that this diagnostic can successfully detect different degrees of phylogenetic autocorrelation in small and large phylogenies as well as in different types of phenotypic characters. The challenges and difficulties associated with applying the proposed methodological approach and the test for serial independence are discussed.",W1909417450,False,0.1472630351781845

Significant allometry inconsistent with Rensch's rule occurs in only one taxon. Meta-analysis of these results reveals that Rensch's rule is general and highly significant. Only owls have allometry inconsistent with this trend.

https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.1997.0036,Correlated evolution and independent contrasts,"The use of the independent contrast method in comparative tests is studied. It is assumed that: (i) the traits under investigation are subject to natural selection; (ii) closely related species are similar because they share many characteristics of their niche, inherited from a common ancestor; and (iii) the current adaptive significance of the traits is the focus of investigation. The main objection to the use of species values in this case is that third variables which are shared by closely related species confound the relationship between the focal traits. In this paper, I argue that third variables are largely not controlled by the contrast methods, which are designed to estimate correlated evolution. To the extent that third variables also show correlated evolution, the true relationship among the traits of interest will remain obscured. Although the independent contrast method does not resolve the influence of third traits it does, in principle, provide a greater resolution than the use of the species mean values. However, its validity depends on the applicability of an evolutionary model which has a substantial stochastic component. To illustrate the consequences of relaxing this assumption I consider an alternative model on an adaptive radiation, where species come to fill a fixed niche space. Under this model, the expected value for the contrast correlation differs from that for the species correlation. The two correlations differ because contrasts reflect the historical pattern of diversification among species, whereas the species values describe the present–day relationships among the species. If the latter is of interest, I suggest that assessing significance based on the species correlations can be justified, providing that attention is paid to the role of potentially confounding third traits. Often, differences between contrast and species correlations may be biologically informative, reflecting changes in correlations between traits as an adaptive radiation proceeds; contrasts may be particularly useful as a means of investigating past history, rather than current utility of traits.",W1986945755,False,0.6470503807067871

These algorithms are not appropriate when the polytomy is interpreted in the usual way, namely as representing uncertainty in the cladogram's resolution.

Sun and shade species were also grown at various plant densities and in interspecific competition in different light intensities and qualities. All the species examined responded to light intensity strongly, and in very much the same way. Sun species generally responded differently than shade species to a low red/far-red ratio: their stem extension increased markedly and their dark respiration rate was higher. The shade species generally responded similarly, but to a lesser degree. Interactions were recorded between the effects of light intensity and the effects of nutrient supply when nitrate supply was limiting and also when phosphate supply was limiting. To ensure that its limiting effect did not depend on plant size, the nitrate, or phosphate, was supplied in a high concentration intermittently and therefore exponential growth occurred in all combinations of light intensity and nutrient supply. When competing with shade species in higher light intensities, the sun species definitely had greater competitive abilities than their competitors. In lower light intensities the competitive ability of a species seemed to depend more on its weight at the beginning of the experiment. The formation of weaker stems in sun species, however, could be an important disadvantage for these species when competing in lower light intensities, especially when the red/far-red ratio is also low, as occurs in natural shade. It can be concluded that the responses to the red/far-red ratio are crucial in the explanation of the habitat preferences of sun and shade species.

https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-1097.1992.tb02234.x,PHOTOMORPHOGENIC PROCESSES IN THE AGRICULTURAL ENVIRONMENT,"Abstract— We review recent advances in our understanding of how photomorphogenic mechanisms influence processes of significance for agriculture, including weed seed germination, acclimation to solar UV‐B radiation, and plant interactions in canopies. It has been demonstrated recently that seeds of some weed species acquire the ability to germinate in response to very low photon fluences during burial. Short sunlight pulses perceived by seeds during tillage appear to be important signals of soil disturbance. Regarding UV‐B acclimation there is increasing evidence for the involvement of a specific UV‐B photoreceptor in pigmentation and morphological responses to UV‐B. The protective role played by UV‐B‐induced flavonoids has been experimentally demonstrated. Concerning plant interactions in canopies it has been shown that, by perceiving light signals through phytochrome and blue‐UV‐A photoreceptors, plants obtain information about the characteristics of the surrounding vegetation well before their resources are reduced as a consequence of neighbors' activities. There appears to be a large potential for improving cropping systems by manipulating the light environment or by changing the photomorphogenic behavior of crop plants. However, relatively little is known about how the expression and agronomic significance of photomorphogenic responses are influenced by other factors of the plant's environment.",W1972231862,False,0.4193255305290222

Merr. cv Tracy and Ransom) were grown under N(2)-dependent or NO(3) (-)-supplied conditions, and the partitioning of photosynthate and dry matter was characterized. Although no treatment effects on photosynthetic rates were observed, NO(3) (-)-supplied plants in both cultivars had lower starch accumulation rates than N(2)-dependent plants. Leaf extracts of NO(3) (-)-supplied plants had higher activities of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) and cytoplasmic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) than N(2)-dependent plants. The variation in starch accumulation was correlated negatively with the activity of SPS, but not the activity of FBPase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, or ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. These results suggested that starch accumulation is biochemically controlled, in part, by the activity of SPS. Leaf starch content at the beginning of the photoperiod was lower in NO(3) (-)-supplied plants than N(2)-dependent plants in both cultivars which suggested that net starch utilization as well as accumulation was affected by N source.Total dry matter accumulation and dry matter distribution was affected by N source in both cultivars, but the cultivars differed in how dry matter was partitioned between the shoot and root as well as within the shoot. The activity of SPS was correlated positively with total dry matter accumulation which suggested that SPS activity is related to plant growth rate. The results suggested that photosynthate partitioning is an important but not an exclusive factor which determines whole plant dry matter distribution.",W1975693623,False,0.5262815356254578

https://doi.org/10.1086/284347,Biological Control in Theory and Practice,"The conventional wisdom of biological control of insect pests, and its related ecological theory, is that successful natural enemies in long-lived ecosystems (1) impose a low, stable pest equilibrium, and (2) share the following properties: (a) host-specific; (b) synchronous with the pest; (c) can increase in density rapidly when the pest does; (d) need only one pest individual to complete their life cycle; (e) have a high search rate for the pest; (f) aggregate at areas of high pest density, which is thought to stabilize the interaction. These features are more characteristic of parasitoids than predators. We suggest that a stable pest equilibrium is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for control. We show that satisfactory control in model systems is compatible with both local extinction of the pest and polyphagy in the natural enemy. Only one of nine real examples of successful control is convincingly a stable interaction; the remainder show either strong evidence for instability and local extinction of the pest or are consistent with this interpretation. Successful natural enemies have collectively violated all of features 1 and 2 above, and violations of features 1 and 2a, 2b, and 2d appear to have been central to success in several situations. Two strategies by which a natural enemy may control a pest in a nonequilibrium state, termed here ""lying-in-wait"" and ""search-and-destroy,"" are distinguished.",W1994977775,False,0.6184695959091187

To understand this role, it is important to determine rates and mechanisms of virus removal and degradation. We used plaque assays to examine the decay of infectivity in lab-grown viruses seeded into natural seawater. The rates of loss of infectivity of native viruses from Santa Monica Bay and of nonnative viruses from the North Sea in the coastal seawater of Santa Monica Bay were determined. Viruses were seeded into fresh seawater that had been pretreated in various ways: filtration with a 0.2-(mu)m-pore-size filter to remove organisms, heat to denature enzymes, and dissolved organic matter enrichment to reconstitute enzyme activity. Seawater samples were then incubated in full sunlight, in the dark, or under glass to allow partitioning of causative agents of virus decay. Solar radiation always resulted in increased rates of loss of virus infectivity. Virus isolates which are native to Santa Monica Bay consistently degraded more slowly in full sunlight in untreated seawater (decay ranged from 4.1 to 7.2% h(sup-1)) than nonnative marine bacteriophages which were isolated from the North Sea (decay ranged from 6.6 to 11.1% h(sup-1)). All phages demonstrated susceptibility to degradation by heat-labile substances, as heat treatment reduced the decay rates to about 0.5 to 2.0% h(sup-1) in the dark. Filtration reduced decay rates by various amounts, averaging 20%. Heat-labile, high-molecular-weight dissolved material (&gt;30 kDa, probably enzymes) appeared responsible for about 1/5 of the maximal decay. Solar radiation was responsible for about 1/3 to 2/3 of the maximal decay of nonnative viruses and about 1/4 to 1/3 of that of the native viruses, suggesting evolutionary adaptation to local light levels. Our results suggest that sunlight is an important contributing factor to virus decay but also point to the significance of particles and dissolved substances in seawater.",W1853212122,False,0.6362585425376892

Virus concentrations determined by transmission electron microscopy of VFF-concentrated samples ranged from 3.4 x 10(7)/ml for a eutrophic Tampa Bay sample to 2.4 x 10(5) for an oligotrophic oceanic surface sample from the southeastern Gulf of Mexico.

Filtration of samples through Nuclepore or Durapore filters (pore size, 0.2 micron) prior to VFF reduced phage counts by an average of two-thirds. Measurement of dissolved-DNA content by Hoechst 33258 fluorescence in environmental samples concentrated by VFF yielded values only ca. 35% of those obtained for samples concentrated by ethanol precipitation (the standard dissolved-DNA method). However, ethanol precipitation of VFF-concentrated extracts resulted in an increase in measurable DNA, reaching 80% of the value obtained by the standard method.

Using mathematical models we examine what role these fungi can play in determining the competitive outcome between two plants in competition for one mineral resource. Depending on different relationships between the benefit accrued to the plant and the fungi, the presence of mycorrhizal fungi can (i) have no impact on which plant wins in competition, (ii) change the order of competitive dominance or (iii) enable coexistence when compared with the system in the absence of mycorrhizal fungi. Furthermore, environmental conditions, such as light and nutrient levels, can determine if coexistence is possible.

Formylated phloroglucinols are a new class of PSMs that act as antifeedants for possums and koalas. What physiological processes are present that permit insects to eat eucalypt foliage and how do PSMs influence insect feeding or digestion? Some trees seem to be repeatedly infested with eucalypt‐feeding insects, possibly as a result of previous chemosensory cues remaining from parental selection of a plant. Avoidance or storage of PSMs permit jarrah leafminers ( Perthida glyphopa ) and sawflies ( Perga sp.) to consume eucalypt foliage without dealing with the majority of these compounds. Some PSMs can be metabolized by polysubstrate membrane oxidases as found in caterpillars or sawflies that feed on eucalypts. High midgut pH may be advantageous for nutrient extraction and PSM metabolism, and midgut pH ranges between 8.5 and 8.9 for caterpillars of Hyalarcta huebneri. Plant secondary metabolites may not be absorbed as a result of the combined presence of the peritrophic matrix and endogenous surfactants. Excretion of PSMs can be as metabolites or intact compounds. Both putative metabolites and sideroxylonal‐A, an FPG, are present in the faeces of larvae of the case moth, H. huebneri. The presence of sideroxylonal‐A in the food had an effect on the presence of 5‐hydroxytryptamine (5HT) in the central nervous system of caterpillars, as larvae fed leaves with a high concentration of sideroxylonal‐A had relatively more 5HT in the brain and central nervous system ganglia than larvae fed leaves containing a low concentration. Further work is necessary to clarify how PSMs are handled by eucalypt‐feeding insects and what effect FPGs have on feeding and digestion.",W1944711465,False,0.6868008971214294

Using a one-locus, two-allele model, I show that this temporal assortative mating can: (1) lead to declines in mean fitness under balancing selection, including fixation of one allele; (2) strongly affect the rate of response to directional selection; and (3) determine the boundaries of the basins of attraction under disruptive selection. These results suggest that the evolution of phenological traits – and traits functionally coupled with them – may be more complex than we have generally thought.

There are seven different types of mycorrhiza, but the two that are most abundant in nature and of most importance ecologically, are the arbuscular and ectomycorrhiza. An excellent review of all aspects of mycorrhizal biology can be found in Smith and Read (1997). Arbuscular mycorrhizae are formed by about 150 different species of fungi within the Glomeromycota and are mostly associated with herbaceous plants. The fungus enters the roots of plants where hyphae grow intercellularly. In addition, unique highly branched structures are formed within the cells of plant roots, called arbuscules. These are thought to be sites of nutrient exchange. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi occur in all ecosystems of the world and associate with the roots of about 70% of all vascular plants (Hodge 2000). Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi generally associate with woody plants. They are formed by about 5000 species of fungi, mainly from the Basidiomycotina, with some representatives from the Ascomycotina also. The fungus forms a sheath over the root tips and there is some intercellular, but no intracellular, growth of the hyphae. Ectomycorrhizae also have worldwide distributions, and although they associate with only about 3% of seed plants, their global importance is huge, as they associate with important timber and natural forest trees.",W1535888150,False,0.8802464604377747

The cool-season grasses had significantly more primary and secondary roots than warm-season grasses, and the diameter of primary, secondary, and tertiary roots of cool-season grasses was significantly smaller than that of warm-season grasses. Soil microorganisms, mycorrhizae, and P fertilization did not affect root number or diameter of the cool-season grasses; root number of warm-season grasses did respond to mycorrhizae and P fertilization, but not soil microorganisms. Specific root length of cool-season grasses was not altered by mycorrhizae, soil microbes, or P fertilization, and was significantly greater than that of warm-season grasses, particularly those inoculated with mycorrhizae. Topological analysis of root architecture revealed that mycorrhizal symbiosis inhibited root branching in warm-season grasses but had no effect on rooting strategy of cool-season grasses. In contrast, P fertilization did not substantially alter root branching in warm- or cool-season grasses. Apparently, root architecture of the mycorrhizal-dependent warm-season grasses is quite plastic, allowing energy expenditure for root development to be conserved; the root architecture of the less mycorrhizal-dependent cool-season grasses appears to be fixed and does not alter to accommodate the symbiosis.

Co-inoculation of soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) roots with Bradyrhizobium japonicum 61-A-101 considerably enhanced colonization by the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae. A similar stimulatory effect on mycorrhizal colonization was also observed in nonnodulating soybean mutants when inoculated with Bradyrhizobium japonicum and in wild-type soybean plants when inoculated with ineffective rhizobial strains, indicating that a functional rhizobial symbiosis is not necessary for enhanced mycorrhiza formation. Inoculation with the mutant Rhizobium sp. NGR[delta]nodABC, unable to produce nodulation (Nod) factors, did not show any effect on mycorrhiza. Highly purified Nod factors also increased the degree of mycorrhizal colonization. Nod factors from Rhizobium sp. NGR234 differed in their potential to promote fungal colonization. The acetylated factor NodNGR-V (MeFuc, Ac), added at concentrations as low as 10-9 M, was active, whereas the sulfated factor, NodNGR-V (MeFuc, S), was inactive.

Phytochromes regulate seed germination in response to light and temperature, and different phytochromes contribute to germination under different environmental conditions. 2. Using Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with different combinations of non‐functional phytochromes, we tested which phytochromes contribute to germination and other life‐history traits under field conditions and whether that contribution changes with seed‐maturation temperature. We also quantified natural selection on phytochrome variants through their influence on seed germination. 3. We found that some phytochromes contributed to germination under field conditions and that the phytochrome that contributed most strongly depended on seed‐maturation temperature. Specifically, when seeds were matured under warm temperature, phyA and phyE null plants had the most strongly reduced germination, with phyA not able to germinate late in the season. In contrast, when seeds were matured under cool temperature, phyB nulls had the most reduced germination, and effects of the phyA mutation were apparent only on a phyB background. 4. These effects on germination translated to effects on total lifetime fitness, such that selection on phytochromes that contributed to germination sometimes depended on seed‐maturation conditions. 5. Synthesis. Natural selection on phytochromes occurs through their effects on seed germination, and maternal effects alter phytochrome contributions to germination. Therefore, maternal effects can alter natural selection on phytochromes. The results demonstrate a novel role of maternal effects in contributing to variable natural selection on specific genes associated with plant responses to climatic conditions.",W1579922823,False,0.6711304783821106

Phytochromes are unique among photoreceptors in their capacity to interconvert between a red-absorbing form (absorption maximum of approximately 660 nm) and a far-red absorbing form (absorption maximum of approximately 730 nm), which occur in a dynamic equilibrium within plant cells, corresponding to the proportions of red and far-red energy in ambient light. Because pigments in stems and leaves absorb wavelengths below about 700 nm, this provides plants with an elegant system for detecting their position relative to other plants, with which the plants compete for light. Certain aspects of phytochrome-mediated development outside of flowering plants are strikingly similar to those that have been characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana and other angiosperms. However, early diverging land plants have fewer distinct phytochrome gene lineages, suggesting that both diversification and subfunctionalization have been important in the evolution of the phytochrome gene family. There is evidence that subfunctionalization proceeded by the partitioning among paralogues of photosensory specificity, physiological response modes, and light-regulated gene expression and protein stability. Parallel events of duplication and functional divergence may have coincided with the evolution of canopy shade and the increasing complexity of the light environment. Within angiosperms, patterns of functional divergence are clade-specific and the roles of phytochromes in A. thaliana change across environments, attesting to the evolutionary flexibility and contemporaneous plasticity of phytochrome signalling in the control of development.",W1900160509,False,0.25448843836784363

To understand the genetic basis of this intraspecific variation we analyzed two accessions: the laboratory strain Landsberg erecta (Ler) with low dormancy and the strong-dormancy accession Cape Verde Islands (Cvi). We used a quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping approach to identify loci affecting the after-ripening requirement measured as the number of days of seed dry storage required to reach 50% germination. Thus, seven QTL were identified and named delay of germination (DOG) 1–7. To confirm and characterize these loci, we developed 12 near-isogenic lines carrying single and double Cvi introgression fragments in a Ler genetic background. The analysis of these lines for germination in water confirmed four QTL (DOG1, DOG2, DOG3, and DOG6) as showing large additive effects in Ler background. In addition, it was found that DOG1 and DOG3 genetically interact, the strong dormancy determined by DOG1-Cvi alleles depending on DOG3-Ler alleles. These genotypes were further characterized for seed dormancy/germination behavior in five other test conditions, including seed coat removal, gibberellins, and an abscisic acid biosynthesis inhibitor. The role of the Ler/Cvi allelic variation in affecting dormancy is discussed in the context of current knowledge of Arabidopsis germination.",W1909328526,False,0.0008892950718291104

We used an experimental design based on classical genetics principles to assess whether plants respond to the environmental conditions of their ancestors in an adaptive epigenetic manner. An extensive examination of genetically identical Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh lines exposed to mild heat (30 °C) or cold (16 °C) treatments in the parental and F 1 generations revealed that the prior elevated temperature regime lead to a greater than fivefold improvement in fitness (seed production per individual) for plants exposed to heat in a later generation (F 3 ). The heat-specific fitness improvements among F 3 plants were observed even though the heat-treated parental and F 1 generations were followed by a generation grown at a normal temperature (F 2 ) and point towards a temperature-induced adaptive epigenetic phenomenon. No such adaptive responses were detected for cold-treated plants, indicating that there are distinctive biological processes inherent to these two temperature regimes.

In this survey, pollen‐ovule ratios were determined for 66 crucifer taxa (Cruciferae) with known breeding systems to establish whether a clear distinction could be made between the pollen‐ovule ratios of allogamous and autogamous crucifers and whether this was sufficient to allow a standard to be set for the Cruciferae. Both the mean number of pollen grains per flower and the pollen‐ovule ratio were significantly larger in the allogamous taxa than in the autogamous taxa, whereas the mean number of ovules per flower was not significantly different. However, the pollen‐ovule ratio was found to be a much better indicator of the breeding system than the mean number of pollen grains by itself, based on the degree of overlap between the values for the allogamous and autogamous taxa. Variation in the amount of pollen produced by different sets of stamens and a correlation between the pollen‐ovule ratio and seed size were identified as potential sources of error in calculating and interpreting the pollen‐ovule ratios. This survey suggests that the pollen‐ovule ratios of allogamous crucifers are typically greater than 3,500, that those of autogamous crucifers are typically less than 1,000, and that these standards can be used for indicating the breeding systems of other species in the Cruciferae.",W1972943133,False,0.7802109718322754

Survival in the common garden (at 63°49′N) was positively correlated with latitude of origin and the size and number of winter buds produced in the preceding year.

Competition among conspecifics of the same cohort has been traditionally thought to be a main process driving population dynamics. In this classical view, however, the role of facilitation in stressful conditions has rarely been considered. Here, using a transplant experiment across a forest–prairie gradient, we test whether the stress gradient hypothesis (SGH) extends to individuals thought to be strongly competing. 2. We transplanted 2‐year‐old seedlings of Nothofagus pumilio at two different densities (clusters of 10 and isolated) and at different distances from the forest edge (from 30 m inside the forest up to 50 m outside the forest in the prairie). We further stem‐mapped all seedlings belonging to the clusters and computed a competition index (CI). After 3 years of growing, survival and increment growth in diameter and height were measured and analysed using mixed‐effects models. We conducted a nearest‐neighbour analysis using seedlings’ CI and growth and computed model fit using the area under the curve (AUC) method. 3. Seedlings planted in dense clusters had significantly higher survival than solitary seedlings at the stressful end of the gradient. This trend was reversed at the opposite end of the gradient, supporting the SGH at the intraspecific level. Pursuing this at the level of the individual, we found that higher CIs (more neighbours) in seedlings predicted higher probabilities of their survival (facilitation) in stressful conditions. 4. Seedlings diameter and height increment growth were not affected by planting density and only diameter varied along the stress gradient; seedlings had higher diameter increments in growth outside the forest. Finally, when compared with conceptual models, our results mostly support predictions of a higher facilitation at intermediate position along the gradient. 5. Synthesis. We showed that facilitation overrides competition among tree seedlings even at locations under moderate stress; the facilitation process occurs in resource‐mediated interactions (niche overlapping). These results represent an important shift in our way to understand the density‐dependent mortality process, and calls for a model reformulation including positive interactions even when competition is expected to be strongest (conspecifics of the same cohort).",W1541320621,False,0.8142294883728027

,Managing smoke from wildfires and prescribed burning in southern Australia,"In Australia the responsibility for management of forests and other public lands rests largely with state governments, and multiple government agencies may be involved in fire management. Whether resulting from wildfire, fuel reduction, or silvicultural operations, biomass burning often stimulates community concerns about hazards from fine particulates and chemical compounds contained in smoke. Management practices and community perceptions of smoke from biomass burning differ from region to region according to social and environmental factors. Recognition of the need for a response to concerns has led to the development of a smoke management research program within the Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre, in conjunction with fire and land management agencies and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (the Bureau). This program aims to assist land management planning by predicting where smoke from scheduled burns would be transported, thus providing the opportunity to avoid burning in situations where there is potential for adverse community impact. The primary tool provided is a dispersion model forecast using input from the Bureau’s operational mesoscale numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Decision tools are applied in a similar manner for prescribed burning and wildfires and have been used by agencies to provide community advice and to avoid smoke hazards during aircraft operations. We investigated strategies used by land management agencies to minimize community impact of smoke from prescribed burns, and studied the way in which the dispersion model forecasts are integrated into their decision support systems.",W1480397459,False,0.011243289336562157

Rev. 34: 221–242) proposed a theory about the restricted movement of stream fishes that may be considered a paradigm in salmonid biology. The restricted movement paradigm (our term) hold that resident stream salmonids are sedentary. Numerous studies have supported the restricted movement paradigm, but nearly all have relied on the recapture of marked fish from the same areas in which they were released, an approach we believe is biased against detecting movement. We found substantial movement of trout in streams in Colorado and Wyoming using two-way weirs and radio telemetry. A review of the research on Lawrence Creek, Wisconsin, also showed that movement was important in the response of the trout population to habitat enhancement. Movement of resident stream fish has profound implications for research (e.g., measuring production and habitat models) and management (e.g., habitat enhancement, special regulations, and stocking hatchery fish). Methods capable of detecting fish movement could be incorporated into many studies to assess its importance in systems of interest. New theories and experiments are needed to understand the mechanisms that cause stream salmonids to move.",W1986118316,False,0.8104851245880127

In contrast to the fairly routine and automated data acquisition steps, subsequent compound annotation and identification require extensive manual analysis and thus form a major bottleneck in data interpretation. Here we present CAMERA, a Bioconductor package integrating algorithms to extract compound spectra, annotate isotope and adduct peaks, and propose the accurate compound mass even in highly complex data. To evaluate the algorithms, we compared the annotation of CAMERA against a manually defined annotation for a mixture of known compounds spiked into a complex matrix at different concentrations. CAMERA successfully extracted accurate masses for 89.7% and 90.3% of the annotatable compounds in positive and negative ion modes, respectively. Furthermore, we present a novel annotation approach that combines spectral information of data acquired in opposite ion modes to further improve the annotation rate.

Quality evaluation of databases,"The high success of the ""uncertified"" mass spectrometry spectral collection started in 1956 demonstrated qualitatively that a partial reference mass spectrum, even one measured routinely, can be of real value. Correct matchings were still possible despite reference errors, which almost never led to close matches that were incorrect. This study shows quantitatively that the number of different compounds, not the number of peaks in a spectrum, is by far the most important determinant of database efficiency for identifying a ""global"" unknown. A statistical evaluation of matching performance shows that only 6, 12, and 18 peaks in a reference spectrum are 13%, 67%, and 96%, respectively, as valuable as hundreds of peaks. Also, a separately measured second spectrum of the same compound is 50% as valuable as the first. Database expansion that tripled the number of possible wrong answers only reduced the proportion of correct identifications by 5%. Corrections of a mass or abundance error in each of six reference spectra increase the database matching performance by as much as the addition of one spectrum of a new compound.

To satisfy this need, analytical facilities must adopt protocols that can support the rapid, cost-effective assembly of barcodes. In this paper we discuss the prospects for establishing high volume DNA barcoding facilities by evaluating key steps in the analytical chain from specimens to barcodes. Alliances with members of the taxonomic community represent the most effective strategy for provisioning the analytical chain with specimens. The optimal protocols for DNA extraction and subsequent PCR amplification of the barcode region depend strongly on their condition, but production targets of 100K barcode records per year are now feasible for facilities working with compliant specimens. The analysis of museum collections is currently challenging, but PCR cocktails that combine polymerases with repair enzyme(s) promise future success. Barcode analysis is already a cost-effective option for species identification in some situations and this will increasingly be the case as reference libraries are assembled and analytical protocols are simplified.",W2148271075,False,0.24665626883506775

This gene codes for heat-stable enterotoxin type I. The use of an inosine-containing pair of amplification primers allowed the amplification of a specific 175-bp DNA fragment from several different estA alleles. The amplified fragments were identified and distinguished by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization and characterized by restriction endonuclease analysis. An extension of the classical two-primer PCR proved to be a very simple and rapid method to identify and characterize the estA alleles. Besides the inosine-containing pair of primers, which recognized all described alleles, additional oligonucleotides were used as primers. The sequence of each of these primers was allele specific, and each was amplification compatible with one of the inosine-containing primers. Thus, in one PCR the 175-bp fragment typical for all estA alleles and an allele-specific fragment of different size were produced. These fragments could be separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and were recognized by ethidium bromide staining. Twenty-seven E. coli strains were tested with this amplification system.

Therefore, different pre-PCR treatments are being used to reduce the effects of PCR inhibitors. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of 16 amplification facilitators to enhance DNA amplification in the presence of blood, feces, or meat. Different concentrations of amplification facilitators and inhibitory samples were added to PCR mixtures containing rTth or Taq DNA polymerase. The addition of 0.6% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin to reaction mixtures containing Taq DNA polymerase reduced the inhibitory effect of blood and allowed DNA amplification in the presence of 2% instead of 0.2% (vol/vol) blood. Furthermore, the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to reaction mixtures containing feces or meat enhanced the amplification capacities of both polymerases. Taq DNA polymerase was able to amplify DNA in the presence of 4% instead of 0.4% (vol/vol) feces and 4% instead of 0.2% (vol/vol) meat, and rTth was able to amplify DNA in the presence of 4% instead of 0.4% (vol/vol) feces and 20% instead of 2% (vol/vol) meat. The single-stranded DNA binding T4 gene 32 protein (gp32) had a relieving effect similar to that of BSA, except when it was added to PCR mixtures of rTth containing meat and of Taq DNA polymerase containing feces. The relieving effects of betaine and a cocktail of proteinase inhibitors were more sample specific. The addition of 11.7% (wt/vol) betaine allowed Taq DNA polymerase to amplify DNA in the presence of 2% (vol/vol) blood, while the addition of proteinase inhibitors allowed DNA amplification by both polymerases in the presence of 4% (vol/vol) feces.

The present work used PCR amplification of three DNA sequences (HLA DPB1, amelogenin and mitochondrial) to assess the efficiency of three methods for extracting DNA (sodium acetate, magnetic beads and glass-milk) from 32 skeletal samples and 25 blood stains up to 43 years old. The results, analyzed using multivariate statistics, confirmed that the extraction method was crucial to the subsequent detection of amplification products; the glass-milk protocol performed better than sodium acetate, which was better than magnetic beads. Successful amplification also depended on gene sequence, multiple copy mitochondrial sequences performing best; however, with the singly copy sequences, the longer HLA DPB1 (327 bp) being detected just as often as the shorter amelogenin (106/112 bp). Amplification products were obtained more frequently from blood stains than bone, perhaps reflecting differences inherent in the material, and from younger compared with older specimens, though plateauing seemed to occur after 10 years.

https://doi.org/10.1186/1752-0509-3-57,LeishCyc: a biochemical pathways database for Leishmania major,"Abstract Background Leishmania spp. are sandfly transmitted protozoan parasites that cause a spectrum of diseases in more than 12 million people worldwide. Much research is now focusing on how these parasites adapt to the distinct nutrient environments they encounter in the digestive tract of the sandfly vector and the phagolysosome compartment of mammalian macrophages. While data mining and annotation of the genomes of three Leishmania species has provided an initial inventory of predicted metabolic components and associated pathways, resources for integrating this information into metabolic networks and incorporating data from transcript, protein, and metabolite profiling studies is currently lacking. The development of a reliable, expertly curated, and widely available model of Leishmania metabolic networks is required to facilitate systems analysis, as well as discovery and prioritization of new drug targets for this important human pathogen. Description The LeishCyc database was initially built from the genome sequence of Leishmania major (v5.2), based on the annotation published by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. LeishCyc was manually curated to remove errors, correct automated predictions, and add information from the literature. The ongoing curation is based on public sources, literature searches, and our own experimental and bioinformatics studies. In a number of instances we have improved on the original genome annotation, and, in some ambiguous cases, collected relevant information from the literature in order to help clarify gene or protein annotation in the future. All genes in LeishCyc are linked to the corresponding entry in GeneDB (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute). Conclusion The LeishCyc database describes Leishmania major genes, gene products, metabolites, their relationships and biochemical organization into metabolic pathways. LeishCyc provides a systematic approach to organizing the evolving information about Leishmania biochemical networks and is a tool for analysis, interpretation, and visualization of Leishmania Omics data (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) in the context of metabolic pathways. LeishCyc is the first such database for the Trypanosomatidae family, which includes a number of other important human parasites.

The method detects acyl CoA esters with acyl chain lengths from C4 to C20 down to concentrations as low as 6 fmol in extracts. Acyl CoA esters from standard solutions or plant extracts were derived to their fluorescent acyl etheno CoA esters in the presence of chloroacetaldehyde, separated by ion-paired reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and detected fluorometrically. This derivitization procedure circumvents the selectivity problems associated with previously published enzymatic methods, and methods that rely on acyl chain or thiol group modification for acyl CoA ester detection. The formation of acyl etheno CoA esters was verified by mass spectrometry, which was also used to identify unknown peaks from chromatograms of plant extracts. Using this method, we report the composition and concentration of the acyl CoA pool during lipid synthesis in maturing Brassica napus seeds and during storage lipid breakdown in 2-day-old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. The concentrations measured were in the 3--6 microM range for both tissue types. We also demonstrate the utility of acyl CoA profiling in a transgenic B. napus line that has high levels of lauric acid. To our knowledge, this is the first time that reliable estimates of acyl CoA ester concentrations have been made for higher plants, and the ability to profile these metabolites provides a valuable new tool for the investigation of gene function.",W1501718618,False,0.3032895624637604

Two small-molecule mixtures with a difference in relative concentration of 20−100% for 10 of the compounds were added to human serum. The metabolomics protocol using UPLC and XCMS for LC−MS data alignment could readily identify 8 of 10 spiked differences among more than 2700 features detected. Normalization of data against a single factor obtained through averaging the XCMS integrated response areas of spiked standards increased the number of identified differences. The original data structure was well preserved using XCMS, but reintegration of identified differences in the original data reduced the number of false positives. Using UPLC for separation resulted in 20% more detected components compared to HPLC. The length of the chromatographic separation also proved to be a crucial parameter for a number of detected features. Moreover, UPLC displayed better retention time reproducibility and signal-to-noise ratios for spiked compounds over HPLC, making this technology more suitable for nontargeted metabolomics applications.",W1978921268,False,0.00039795608608983457

The pool size changed during incubation; this change in pool size is incorporated into a model which predicts the dynamics of 15 N-NH 4 + dilution. A simple microdiffusion of NH 3 was followed by an emission spectrometry analysis of 15 N content. This procedure avoided all problems of cross-contamination. The model was tested and rates were measured in four sediment cores, at seven different depths. The high correlation coefficients (mean, 0.96 for the 0- to 2-, 2- to 4-, 4- to 6-, and 6- to 8-cm sediment fractions) indicated that the model was correct and that the measured rates were valid. The immediate distribution of 15 N-NH 4 + between interstitial and exchangeable NH 4 + pools indicated that it was the combined pool that was turning over. In the 0- to 2-cm fraction at 17�C the net rate of NH 4 + production was 274 (standard deviation, 31) nmol cm −3 day −1, and the mean total rate of NH 4 + production was 309 (standard deviation, 39) nmol cm −3 day −1 ; both rates decreased to &lt;1% of these values in the 12- to 14-cm fractions.",W1586826742,False,0.18547360599040985

However, different crop management practices can have a negative effect on predator populations. If so, there is a need for recolonisation by the predators to the crop fields. An important pest in Sweden is the bird cherry‐oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi, which migrates to cereal fields in spring. In turn, many cereal fields are spring sown and thus are disturbed by harrowing and sowing a short time before aphid arrival. In this study, three different questions about the populations of spiders and carabids in spring cereal crops were asked. First, does sowing in spring have a negative effect on the predators present in the fields? Second, if sowing has a negative effect on predator populations, do they recolonise the fields before pest arrival? Third, how are the predators distributed in the fields? We found that most carabids and most lycosid spiders were not affected by sowing and were distributed uniformly in the fields after sowing. Most linyphiid spiders were negatively affected by sowing, but then they recolonised the fields and were uniformly distributed in the fields after recolonisation. Thus, many spiders and carabids are present in the fields after sowing in spring and have the opportunity to suppress aphids during their establishment phase, which in turn may prevent a possible outbreak.",W2011773643,False,0.5530014634132385

R. G. The percentage of the two species most commonly sampled (Oedothorax apicatus and Erigone atra, both Erigoninae) was 66% on bio‐dynamic and 81% on conventional fields. Their activity densities on conventional fields were usually higher than on the corresponding bio‐dynamic fields. In contrast, all other spiders were more common on bio‐dynamic fields. 11% of the spiders sampled on biodynamic fields were Lycosidae; on conventional fields, species of this family became almost extinct (2%). The dominant Lycosidae was Pardosa amentata. Most species of Lycosidae were largely restricted to the field‐edges, only Pardosa prativaga invaded the field‐centers in higher numbers. It is concluded that the occurence of Lycosidae in arable land depends on agricultural management as well as on the presence of nearby undisturbed areas. From the results it might be concluded that the potential prey impact of spiders on Aphidina and Collembola is not reduced on conventional fields compared with bio‐dynamic fields, but the prey impact on somewhat larger insects must be extremely low. For conservating a diverse spider fauna on arable land, it is necessary to reduce the application of pesticides and to support the colonisation of spiders into cereal fields. To it the size of the fields should be rather low and the fields intermixed with undisturbed areas. Zusammenfassung Zur Wirkung von biodynamischer und konventioneller Landwirtschaft auf Spinnen (Erigoninae und Lycosidae) Die Wirkung biologisch‐dynamischer und konventioneller Feldbewirtschaftung auf die Struktur der Spinnenfauna und die Aktivitätsdichte (Barberfallenfänge) dominanter Erigoninae‐ und Lycosidae‐Arten wurde in einem vierjährigen Vergleich untersucht. Der relative Anteil der beiden häufigsten Arten Oedothorax apicatus und Erigone atra betrug 66% auf biologisch‐dynamisch, 81% auf konventionell bewirtschafteten Feldern. Ihre Aktivitätsdichte auf konventionell bewirtschafteten Feldern war meist höher als auf den entsprechenden biologisch‐dynamisch bewirtschafteten, seltener war es umgekehrt oder es bestanden keine Unterschiede. Die übrigen Spinnen waren dagegen auf biologisch‐dynamischen Feldern häufiger. Der relative Anteil der Lycosidae betrug 11% auf biologisch‐dynamischen, aber nur 2% auf konventionellen Feldern. Häufigste Art war Pardosa amentata. Darüber hinaus war die Aktivitätsdichte aller Lycosidae‐Arten am Rand der Felder deutlich höher als im Zentrum, wo nur noch Pardosa prativaga in nennenswerter Dichte auftrat. Das Vorkommen von Lycosidae auf Feldern wird sowohl durch die Bewirtschaftung als auch durch Saumstrukturen beeinflußt. Die Ergebnisse gestatten den Schluß, daß der Prädationsdruck der Spinnen auf Aphidina und Collembola auf konventionellen Feldern eher etwas höher ist als auf biologisch‐dynamisch bewirtschafteten, da die beiden dominanten Erigoninae‐Arten auf konventionellen Feldern im Mittel häufiger auftraten. Der Prädationsdruck auf etwas größere Insekten ist auf konventionellen Feldern aber extrem gering, da mittelgroße Spinnen (z. B. Lycosidae) auf diesen Feldern stark zurückgedrängt worden sind. Um eine vielfältige Spinnenfauna auf den Getreidefeldern zu erhalten und ihr Potential als Antagonisten von Schadinsekten voll zu nutzen, ist es erforderlich, den Pestizideinsatz auf ein Mindestmaß zu reduzieren und die Migration von Spinnen in die Felder zu erleichtern. Hierzu sollten die Schlaggröße möglichst gering gehalten werden und in ausreichendem Maße breite Saumstrukturen und Ausgleichsflächen geschaffen werden.",W1977508681,False,0.7359193563461304

The units of behaviour selected are characteristic of the hunting sequence, and as such are of potential systematic and physiological importance.

https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.54.1.119,Orientation by Jumping Spiders in the Absence of Visual Feedback,"ABSTRACT Jumping spiders turn to face moving objects. These turns are mediated by the lateral eyes. They can be accomplished accurately whether or not the spider sees the relative movement of the stimulus across the retinae which would normally result from such a turn. The spider’s response to an adequate stimulus may be: (i) to make a ‘complete’ turn resulting in fixation by the antero-median eyes; (ii) to make a ‘partial’ turn of 10–20°, whose magnitude is independent of stimulus position, and which does not result in fixation, or (iii) to ignore it. To be seen, a stimulus must subtend more than 0–7° (slightly less than the distance between receptors) and must move through a minimum angle of about i°. The probability of a turn being made is greatest for stimuli 40–90° from the spider’s front, and decreases to a low value for stimuli behind the animal, and immediately in front of it. Repeated presentation of a stimulus to one part of the retina results in a rapid decrease to zero of the probability of a turn being made, but turns can still be evoked by moving the stimulus a few degrees to a previously unstimulated part of the retina. Habituation does not affect the sizes of the few turns that are made. Dishabituation can be caused by mechanical stimulation, or it may occur spontaneously. The fields of view of the lateral eyes have been measured in the horizontal plane by blinding each eye and determining the parts of the visual field from which turns could not be evoked. Three kinds of response mediated by the lateral eyes, in addition to turns towards the stimulus, are described.",W1897664312,False,0.000422576442360878

It is usually the second most limiting nutrient for terrestrial primary production (after nitrogen) and is often the primary limiting nutrient in freshwater ecosystems. Due to its critical role in controlling aquatic primary production, there is an increased concern over runoff of P from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems and the role of Pin affecting water quality. Studies of P cycling and availability pose a challenge to agronomists and ecologists, in part because P occurs in soils in many different physicochemical forms that are operationally difficult to define, and in part because Pis involved in a myriad of biological and chemical processes. The cycling of P can be controlled by inorganic chemical reactions, but in many systems the turnover of organic P controls the availability of P to plants through organic matter decomposition or the release of P from microbial biomass. Phosphate sorption by various soil constituents is a dominant process in maintaining very low concentrations of Pin soil solutions, particularly in mineral soils. Tight control of P concentrations by adsorption creates difficulty for the measurement of the amount of P available for plant uptake or P release upon organic matter mineralization. Whereas important pools and fluxes of N are readily measured in soils, the different physicochemical forms of soil P are more difficult to categorize or define operationally. As a result, it is challenging to define or measure bioavailable P.",W1009756313,False,0.47218403220176697

We show that the alternative models proposed by these groups represent two ends of a continuum. Specifically, the gene-for-gene (GFG) model of plant pathologists represents one end of a continuum, where a very broad host range is expected to occur in one pathogen genotype. The matching alleles (MA) model, favoured by invertebrate zoologists, represents the opposite end of the same continuum, where an exact genetic match is required for infection. Since it is known that matching-alleles models give highly dynamical behaviour and selection for recombination if parasites exert strongly negative effects on host fitness, we were especially interested in determining the nature of any such behaviour in the interior regions of the MA–GFG continuum. We found that the highly dynamical aspects of matching-alleles models were observed across most of the continuum, and that recombination would increase geometric mean fitness over about half of the continuum.",W1825097877,False,0.5217918157577515

Methods Statistical methods for skewed count data are described and compared, with reference to a 10‐year period of Tropical Medicine and International Health (TMIH). Two parasitological datasets are used for illustration. Results The review of TMIH found 90 articles, of which 89 used descriptive methods and 60 used inferential analysis. A lack of clarity is noted in identifying the measures of location, in particular the Williams and geometric means. The different measures are compared, emphasising the legitimacy of the arithmetic mean for the skewed data. In the published articles, the t test and related methods were often used on untransformed data, which is likely to be invalid. Several approaches to inferential analysis are described, emphasising (1) non‐parametric methods, while noting that they are not simply comparisons of medians, and (2) generalised linear modelling, in particular with the negative binomial distribution. Additional methods, such as the bootstrap, with potential for greater use are described. Conclusions Clarity is recommended when describing transformations and measures of location.

However, interpretation of results of many previous studies has been complicated by the failure to control for many potentially confounding variables. We gave Tanzanian schoolchildren aged 9–14 a battery of 11 cognitive and three educational tests and assessed their level of helminth infection. We also took measurements of an extensive range of potentially confounding or mediating factors such as socioeconomic and educational factors, anthropometric and other biomedical measures. A total of 272 children were moderately or heavily infected with Schistosoma haematobium, hookworm or both helminth species and 117 were uninfected with either species. Multiple regression analyses, controlling for all confounding and mediating variables, revealed that children with a heavy S. haematobium infection had significantly lower scores than uninfected children on two tests of verbal short‐term memory and two reaction time tasks. In one of these tests the effect was greatest for children with poor nutritional status. There was no association between infection and educational achievement, nor between moderate infection with either species of helminth and performance on the cognitive tests. We conclude that children with heavy worm burdens and poor nutritional status are most likely to suffer cognitive impairment, and the domains of verbal short‐term memory and speed of information processing are those most likely to be affected.",W1263782925,False,0.011519293300807476

Methods In the rainy season 2004, in five rural dispensaries in Burkina Faso, we observed 1101 general outpatient consultations and re‐examined all these patients. CQ whole blood concentrations of confirmed malaria cases were measured before and after treatment. Results The clinical diagnosis based on fever and/or a history of fever had a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 41% when compared to confirmed malaria (defined as an axillary temperature of ≥37.5 °C and/or a history of fever and parasites of any density in the blood smear). Few febrile children under 5 years of age were assessed for other diseases than malaria such as pneumonia. No antimalarial was prescribed for 1.3% of patients with the clinical diagnosis malaria and for 24% of confirmed cases, while 2% received an antimalarial drug prescription without the corresponding clinical diagnosis. CQ was overdosed in 22% of the prescriptions. Before and 2 weeks after consultation, 25% and 46% respectively of the patients with confirmed malaria had potentially toxic CQ concentrations. Conclusion As long as artemisinin‐based combination therapy remains unavailable or unaffordable for most people in rural areas of Burkina Faso, self‐medication with and prescription of CQ are likely to continue despite increasing resistance. Apart from considering more pragmatic first‐line regimens for malaria treatment such as the combination of sulfadoxine‐pyrimethamine with amodiaquine, more and better training on careful clinical management of febrile children including an appropriate consideration of other illnesses than malaria should be made available in the frame of the IMCI initiative in sub‐Saharan Africa.",W1479950516,False,0.1956796944141388

Methods The investigation was carried out from July 2004 to May 2005 in Boeng Cheung Ek lake, a main recipient of wastewater from the city of Phnom Penh. Water spinach samples were collected near two wastewater entry points in the northern part of the lake and near a wastewater exit point in the southern part of the lake, where water is discharged from the lake into a stream. Water spinach samples were harvested at each of the three locations with and without wastewater contact according to the normal practices of farmers, and analysed for ThC, protozoan parasites ( Giardia, Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora ), and helminth eggs ( Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichura and hookworm) using standard methods. Wastewater samples were also collected at each of the three locations and analysed for ThC and helminth eggs. Results High concentrations of ThC (approximately 10 5 –10 7 /g) were found in water spinach samples. ThC mean counts did not differ significantly, neither between sample types at each location, nor between locations. ThC mean concentration of water spinach samples collected in the rainy season of 2005 was higher than that in the dry season of 2004. Protozoan parasites were detected in the samples from all three locations and in water spinach harvested with and without wastewater contact. Giardia spp. were present in 56% (20) of samples with an average cyst concentration of 6.6/g. Mean counts of Giardia were not significantly associated with wastewater contact status of water spinach. Cryptosporidium oocysts were found in 17% (six) of samples with an average concentration of 0.5 oocyst per gram of water spinach. Cyclospora oocysts were detected in 8% (three) of samples. Four (11%) water spinach samples contained helminth eggs (average concentration: 0.1 egg per gram). Water samples contained approximately 10 4 –10 7 ThC per 100 ml and a mean of 27.4 helminth eggs per litre. There was a 2–3 log reduction of ThC between the water samples collected at the wastewater entry and exit point(s) of the lake. Conclusions Water spinach cultivated in the lake was highly contaminated with feces, as indicated by high ThC concentrations and the presence of protozoan parasites. A reduction in ThC numbers almost to WHO guideline levels for irrigation water occurred through natural biological and physical processes in the lake, as shown by differences in ThC counts at wastewater entry and exit points.",W1483781980,False,0.8473315238952637

https://doi.org/10.1017/s0016672300033140,A general model for the evolution of recombination,"Summary A general representation of multilocus selection is extended to allow recombination to depend on genotype. The equations simplify if modifier alleles have small effects on recombination. The evolution of such modifiers only depends on how they alter recombination between the selected loci, and does not involve dominance in modifier effects. The net selection on modifiers can be found explicitly if epistasis is weak relative to recombination. This analysis shows that recombination can be favoured in two ways: because it impedes the response to epistasis which fluctuates in sign, or because it facilitates the response to directional selection. The first mechanism is implausible, because epistasis must change sign over periods of a few generations: faster or slower fluctuations favour reduced recombination. The second mechanism requires weak negative epistasis between favourable alleles, which may either be increasing, or held in check by mutation. The selection ( s i ) on recombination modifiers depends on the reduction in additive variance of log (fitness) due to linkage disequilibria (υ 1 &lt; 0), and on non-additive variance in log (fitness) ( V ′ 2, V ′ 3,.. epistasis between 2, 3.. loci). For unlinked loci and pairwise epistasis, s i = − (υ 1 + 4 V 2 /3)δ r, where δ r is the average increase in recombination caused by the modifier. The approximations are checked against exact calculations for three loci, and against Charlesworth's analyses of mutation/selection balance (1990), and directional selection (1993). The analysis demonstrates a general relation between selection on recombination and observable components of fitness variation, which is open to experimental test.",W1974277137,False,0.06393718719482422
,On the Evolution of Recombination in Haploids and Diploids,"In population genetic theory, most analytical and numerical studies of the evolution of recombination have focused on diploid genetics. In studies of the foundations and applications of genetic algorithms (GA's), however, the bit-strings are usually treated as haploid genotypes. This paper compares analytical results for the evolutionary dynamics of modifiers of recombination in haploids with results derived for diploids. The new analytical work addresses the evolution of an allele that controls the rate of recombination between two loci subject to directional selection. It is shown that the fate of a recombination modifier in both haploids and diploids is determined in a complicated way by the sign of the epistasis (interaction in fitness) between the loci, the sign of the initial linkage disequilibrium, and the amount of recombination between the modifier and the genes under selection. This theory is deterministic in that the population is regarded as infinite and no sampling occurs to produce offspring from parents. The second part of the paper takes selection schemes that have been used recently in numerical studies of finite diploid populations and asks how recombination evolves in haploid versions of these models. Although the analysis keeps track of the recombination controlling locus rather than the time until a desired bit-string appears, our result may be of use to the practitioners of GA's. We find that as a rule high recombination evolves more easily when selection is on haploids than it does in the diploid case. This is especially true of Gaussian selection schemes with high recombination recessive to low recombination. When the fitness regime is more jagged, however, the results depend on the level of jaggedness, with high recombination favored under smoother regimes. We also find that the direction of mutation and dominance relationship among the modifying alleles affects the results. Although there remains much to be done in reconciling the two ways of approaching evolutionary properties of genetic operations, many new and interesting questions have emerged from, and will continue to be stimulated by interactions between practitioners of each approach.",W1510233725,False,0.003469396149739623

Significant effects on the neutral loci arise if the recombination fraction between the neutral and selected loci is smaller than the order of magnitude of the selective differences at the selected locus. The effect on gene frequencies at the neutral loci, that is, the hitchhiking effect, is determined, as well as the linkage disequilibrium generated by this hitchhiking effect. One of the more important findings is that significant disequilibrium can be generated between two neutral loci by the evolution of a linked selected locus. Consideration is given to the problem of determining how the effect of selection operating in natural populations can be detected, the question of the establishment of inversions in populations, and also to the nonequilibrium properties of populations.",W1814098872,False,0.7793995141983032

Four techniques-direct filtration by Rowan's vacuum paper filtration method, a modification of Rowan's method, continous centrifugation, and an overlay filtration method-were compared for recovery accuracy, volume of water sampled, and ease of reading under simulated field conditions. The modified Rowan technique ranked first for mean recovery accuracy (79.4%), followed by continuous centrifugation (53.8%), Rowan's technique (25.9%), and the overlay method (22.4%). With the direct filtration techniques, the filtering rate was directly related to certain turbidity factors, the maximum being 10 litres/min with the modified Rowan technique and clear water. The continuous centrifugation and overlay methods were independent of turbidity variations. Filters could be read most quickly (mean time 3.4 min/filter) with the continuous centrifugation technique because the concentrated sample made it possible to use small (47-mm) filters. Mean reading times with the other techniques (89-mm and 90-mm filters) ranged from 5.6 to 8.4 min per filter but were highly variable in relation to turbidity, particle size, and number of cercariae recovered. Direct filtration by the modified Rowan technique is considered to be the simplest and most efficient method.

A device utilizing the positive phototropism exhibited by the cercariae of S. inansoni was developed by Klock in 1955 (1). It has the disadvantage of requiring inte.nse artificial light necessitating use of current from public utility lines or a portable generator. Therefore, its use under field conditions is limiited. Au apparatus developed by Rowvaan in 1956 (2, 3) was based on the filtration prileiple, first as pressure filtration and later modified to the Buchner funnel vacuuim filtration process (4). The cercariae were collected on filter paper which was then placed in a small amount of ninhydriui dye. The paper was steamed until almost dry, and the stained cercariae on the dry paper were counted in the laboratoiry. Wthen the water was so turbid that cercariae were obscured on the filter paper, water had to be collected in large containers and flocculated, using sodium bicarbonate and filter alum. This 'procedure necessitated an additional lhour of field t,ime and considerably more equipment and chemicals. It ha.d been observed that light material suspended in the turbid water stopped the filter process. Continuous-flow centrifugation was indicated as a means of collecting cercariae and also allowing the major light suspended materials to be washed out even if the water was turbid. The new cercariometer device is based on this concept.",W2206457508,False,0.09291297197341919

In those infected, quantitative egg counts performed by the Kato thick smear method revealed that 57% had light infections (1–100 eggs/g), 27% moderate infections (101–400 eggs/g), and 16% heavy infections (>400 eggs/g; mean—918 eggs/g). The Yemeni had been migrating to the USA for the past 20 years, a period in which the prevalence of schistosomiasis had remained constant in the Yemen. The prevalence of schistosomiasis in those who had been away from Yemen for less than 5 years (up to 20 years) it was 32% with a mean egg output of 75 eggs/g. This is in spite of the fact that 75% of the latter had returned to Yemen for short visits. Statistical analysis by the Fisher's exact probability test revealed a significantly lower egg output in those away from Yemen more than 5 years. On the basis of these findings the mean life span of the Yemeni strain of Schistosoma mansoni in man was estimated to be between 5 and 10 years. The presence of disease was assessed in this population by traditional medical means without prior knowledge of the status of the infection in the individuals examined.

We used computer simulations to test whether complementarity between phenotypic traits of plants and animals can explain the pervasive tendency of specialists to interact with proper subsets of species that generalists interact with (nested interactions), and how phylogeny affects such interaction patterns. Simultaneously, we assessed whether complementarity and phylogenetic structure were associated with patterns of interaction in a real mutualistic community. Simulation results support that highly nested networks can emerge from phenotypic complementarity, particularly when several traits are involved. The hierarchical structure of phylogenetic relations can also contribute to increased nestedness because traits determining complementarity are then inherited in a correlated fashion. Phylogenetic effects on resulting generalization levels are often low, but can be detected. Results from the empirical network support a relevant role of complementarity and phylogenetic history on interaction patterns.

The effectiveness of a frugivorous species as a seed disperser is the contribution it makes to plant fitness. Effectiveness depends on the quantity of seed dispersed (""quantity component"") and the quality of dispersal provided each seed (""quality component""). For the main frugivores, we studied abundance, visitation rate, and feeding behavior, the major variables influencing the quantity component of effectiveness, and the postforaging microhabitat use and resultant seed shadows, which set the stage for postdispersal factors that will influence the quality component of effectiveness. Legitimate seed dispersers (SD) swallowed fruits whole and defecated or regurgitated intact seeds; pulp consumers (PC) pecked fruits to obtain pulp and dropped seeds to the ground, but some species occasionally dispersed seeds (PCSD species). Overall numbers of fruits removed (i.e., handled) by avian frugivores were similar in the two study years; however, the estimated percentage of seeds dispersed differed significantly, with lower relative dispersal success in the year with greater relative abundance of PC species. Similar numbers of seeds were dispersed in the two years despite nearly a fourfold difference in number of fruits produced. Fruit crop size explained >80% variance in the number of seeds dispersed per tree. A total of 38 species of birds were recorded during censuses, with frugivores representing 68.8% of them; the relative representation of SD, PC, and PCSD species was 42.2%, 17.2%, and 9.4%, respectively. Individual trees showed extensive variation in visitation rates, ranging from 0.3 to 41.6 visits/10 h in any year. The main visitors were the SD species Phoenicurus ochruros (10.8 visits/10 h), Turdus viscivorus (9.2 visits/10 h), Erithacus rubecula (3.5 visits/10 h), and Sylvia communis (2.6 visits/10 h); and the PC species Fringilla coelebs (16.7 visits/10 h) and Parus ater (4.7 visits/10 h). Species with large quantity components of effectiveness typically had either high visit or high feeding rates, combined with high probability of dispersing a handled seed. Variation among species in fruit-handling behavior, however, was the main factor influencing variation in the quantity component. Visit rate in turn was influenced largely by local abundance. No single frugivore trait, however, can adequately estimate the quantity component of disperser effectiveness. A ""gulper""/""masher"" dichotomy helps explain differences in fruit handling among major frugivore types and shows many correlates with other aspects of frugivore activity that ultimately influence the quantity component. Most species showed marked preferences for microhabitats with plant cover, especially P. mahaleb, midheight shrubs, and Pinus (86.1% of the departure flights) and avoided open microhabitats. Most flights were over short distances (77.5% to perches located within 30 m). Among the main frugivores, 40.3% of the exit flights were to perches >15 m away from the feeding tree, but only 18.5% of these flights were to perches >15 m from any P. mahaleb. Covered microhabitats received significantly more seeds (39.3 ± 5.0 seeds dispersed/m2, 1988 [mean ± 1 se]; 31.7 ± 5.9 seeds dispersed/m2, 1989) than open microhabitats (2.8 ± 0.7 seeds dispersed/m2, 1988; 1.8 ± 0.4 seeds dispersed/m2, 1989). The potential contribution of each bird species to the seed rain in each microhabitat was estimated from the number of visits recorded, the mean number of seeds dispersed per visit, and the proportion of exit flights to each microhabitat. Microhabitats differed strongly in the proportions of seeds delivered by the main frugivores, and bird species also differed in the proportions of seeds delivered to a given microhabitat. The seed rain to covered microhabitats was delivered by a more heterogeneous assortment of species than the seed rain to open sites. The resulting seed shadow was a complex result of the interaction between movement patterns of a suite of bird species differing both in the quantity of seed dispersed and microhabitat preferences and in the landscape distribution of these microhabitat patches. This seed shadow was extremely nonrandom due both to a strong overall preference by most of the birds for the relatively scarce covered microhabitats and to species-specific preferences for particular types of covered microhabitats. Different microhabitat types not only received variable amounts of dispersed seed, but also differed in the number and identity of disperser species contributing to that seed rain.",W1987187051,False,0.8785594701766968

https://doi.org/10.1086/674965,Conflicting Selection in the Course of Adaptive Diversification: The Interplay between Mutualism and Intraspecific Competition,"Adaptive speciation can occur when a population undergoes assortative mating and disruptive selection caused by frequency-dependent intraspecific competition. However, other interactions, such as mutualisms based on trait matching, may generate conflicting selective pressures that constrain species diversification. We used individual-based simulations to explore how different types of mutualism affect adaptive diversification. A magic trait was assumed to simultaneously mediate mate choice, intraspecific competition, and mutualisms. In scenarios of intimate, specialized mutualisms, individuals interact with one or few individual mutualistic partners, and diversification is constrained only if the mutualism is obligate. In other scenarios, increasing numbers of different partners per individual limit diversification by generating stabilizing selection. Stabilizing selection emerges from the greater likelihood of trait mismatches for rare, extreme phenotypes than for common intermediate phenotypes. Constraints on diversification imposed by increased numbers of partners decrease if the trait matching degree has smaller positive effects on fitness. These results hold after the relaxation of various assumptions. When trait matching matters, mutualism-generated stabilizing selection would thus often constrain diversification in obligate mutualisms, such as ant-myrmecophyte associations, and in low-intimacy mutualisms, including plant-seed disperser systems. Hence, different processes, such as trait convergence favoring the incorporation of nonrelated species, are needed to explain the higher richness of low-intimacy assemblages—shown here to be up to 1 order of magnitude richer than high-intimacy systems.",W1981437692,False,0.787079393863678

Because coevolution operates mainly at the population level, reciprocal coadaptations should result in trait covariation among populations of strongly interacting species. A long-tongued fly (Prosoeca ganglbaueri) and its primary floral food plant (Zaluzianskya microsiphon) were studied across both of their geographical ranges. The dimensions of the fly's proboscis and the flower's corolla tube length varied significantly among sites and were strongly correlated with each other. In addition, the match between tube length of flowers and tongue length of flies was found to affect plant fitness. The relationship between flower tube length and fly proboscis length remained significant in models that included various alternative environmental (altitude, longitude, latitude) and allometric (fly body size, flower diameter) predictor variables.

In terms of accelerated development in the face of pond-drying risk, phenotypic plasticity has been demonstrated in many amphibian species, but two issues of evolutionary interest remain unexplored. First, the heritable basis of plastic responses is poorly established. Second, it is not known whether interpopulational differences in capacity to respond to pond-drying risk exist, although such differences, when matched with differences in desiccation risk would provide strong evidence for local adaptation. We investigated sources of within- and among-population variation in plastic responses to simulated pond-drying risk (three desiccation treatments) in two Rana temporaria populations originating from contrasting environments: (1) high desiccation risk with weak seasonal time constraint (southern population); and (2) low desiccation risk with severe seasonal time constraint (northern population). The larvae originating from the environment with high desiccation risk responded adaptively to the fast decreasing water treatment by accelerating their development and metamorphosing earlier, but this was not the case in the larvae originating from the environment with low desiccation risk. In both populations, metamorphic size was smaller in the high-desiccation-risk treatment, but the effect was larger in the southern population. Significant additive genetic variation in development rate was found in the northern and was nearly significant in the southern population, but there was no evidence for genetic variation in plasticity for development rates in either of the populations. No genetic variation for plasticity was found either in size at metamorphosis or growth rate. All metamorphic traits were heritable, and additive genetic variances were generally somewhat higher in the southern population, although significantly so in only one trait. Dominance variances were also significant in three of four traits, but the populations did not differ. Maternal effects in metamorphic traits were generally weak in both populations. Within-environment phenotypic correlations between larval period and metamorphic size were positive and genetic correlations negative in both populations. These results suggest that adaptive phenotypic plasticity is not a species-specific fixed trait, but evolution of interpopulational differences in plastic responses are possible, although heritability of plasticity appears to be low. The lack of adaptive response to desiccation risk in northern larvae is consistent with the interpretation that selection imposed by shorter growing season has favored rapid development in north (∼8% faster development in north as compared to south) or a minimum metamorphic size at the expense of phenotypic plasticity.",W1969610398,False,0.701242983341217

In the general case of clonal replicates or full‐sibs raised in several environments, the heritability of plasticity can be measured as the ratio of the genotype‐environment interaction variance to the total phenotypic variance. In the special case of only two environments plasticity also can be measured as the difference among environments in genotype or family means. In that case, the heritability of plasticity can be measured as either a ratio of variance components or as the slope of a parent‐offspring regression. The general measure suffers because no least‐square standard errors have been developed, although they can be calculated by maximum‐likelihood or bootstrapping techniques. For the other two methods least‐square standard errors can be calculated but require very large experiments for statistical significance to be achieved. The heritability measures are compared using data on plasticity of thorax size in response to temperature in Drosophila melanogaster. The heritability estimates are all in close agreement. Models of the evolution of phenotypic plasticity have treated it as a trait in its own right and as a cross‐environment genetic correlation.

Upon heat shock, the level of Hsp90 is increased even more, suggesting that it is important for helping cells to survive under these conditions. However, studies so far have been almost exclusively concerned with the function of Hsp90 under non-stress conditions, and therefore only little is known about the role of Hsp90 during heat shock. As a model for heat shock in vitro, we have monitored the inactivation and subsequent aggregation of dimeric citrate synthase (CS) at elevated temperatures. Hsp90 effectively “stabilized” CS under conditions where the enzyme is normally inactivated and finally aggregates very rapidly. A kinetic dissection of the unfolding pathway of CS succeeded in revealing two intermediates which form and subsequently undergo irreversible aggregation reactions. Hsp90 apparently interacts transiently with these highly structured early unfolding intermediates. Binding and subsequent release of the intermediates favorably influences the kinetic partitioning between two competing processes, the further unfolding of CS and the productive refolding to the native state. As a consequence, CS is effectively stabilized in the presence of Hsp90. The significance of this interaction is especially evident in the suppression of aggregation, the major end result of thermal unfolding events in vivo and in vitro. These effects, which are ATP-independent, seem to be a general function of members of the Hsp90 family, since yeast and bovine Hsp90 as well as the Hsp90 homologue from Escherichia coli gave similar results. It seems likely that this function also reflects the role of Hsp90 under heat shock conditions in vivo.

https://doi.org/10.7936/k78050mp,Structural rna homology search and alignment using covariance models,"Functional RNA elements do not encode proteins, but rather function directly as RNAs. Many different types of RNAs play important roles in a wide range of cellular processes, including protein synthesis, gene regulation, protein transport, splicing, and more. Because important sequence and structural features tend to be evolutionarily conserved, one way to learn about functional RNAs is through comparative sequence analysis - by collecting and aligning examples of homologous RNAs and comparing them. Covariance models (CMs) are powerful computational tools for homology search and alignment that score both the conserved sequence and secondary structure of an RNA family. However, due to the high computational complexity of their search and alignment algorithms, searches against large databases and alignment of large RNAs like small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) are prohibitively slow. Large-scale alignment of SSU rRNA is of particular utility for environmental survey studies of microbial diversity which often use the rRNA as a phylogenetic marker of microorganisms. In this work, we improve CM methods by making them faster and more sensitive to remote homology. To accelerate searches, we introduce a query-dependent banding (QDB) technique that makes scoring sequences more efficient by restricting the possible lengths of structural elements based on their probability given the model. We combine QDB with a complementary filtering method that quickly prunes away database subsequences deemed unlikely to receive high CM scores based on sequence conservation alone. To increase search sensitivity, we apply two model parameterization strategies from protein homology search tools to CMs. As judged by our benchmark, these combined approaches yield about a 250-fold speedup and significant increase in search sensitivity compared with previous implementations. To accelerate alignment, we apply a method that uses a fast sequence-based alignment of a target sequence to determine constraints for the more expensive CM sequence- and structure-based alignment. This technique reduces the time required to align one SSU rRNA sequence from about 15 minutes to 1 second with a negligible effect on alignment accuracy. Collectively, these improvements make CMs more powerful and practical tools for RNA homology search and alignment.",W1512916740,False,0.1295119673013687

SCFGs capture the sequences'' common primary and secondary structure and generalize the hidden Markov models (HMMs) used in related work on protein and DNA. The novel aspect of this work is that SCFG parameters are learned automatically from unaligned, unfolded training sequences. A generalization of the HMM forward-backward algorithm is introduced to do this. The new algorithm, Tree-Grammar EM, based on tree grammars and faster than the previously proposed SCFG inside-outside training algorithm, produced a model that we tested on the transfer RNA (tRNA) family. Results show that after having been trained on as few as 20 tRNA sequences from only two tRNA subfamilies (mitochondrial and cytoplasmic), the model can discern general tRNA from similar-length RNA sequences of other kinds, can find secondary structure of new tRNA sequences, and can produce multiple alignments of large sets of tRNA sequences. Our results suggest potential improvements in the alignments of the D- and T-domains in some mitochdondrial tRNAs that cannot be fitted into the canonical secondary structure.",W1246461931,False,0.0002733761502895504

https://doi.org/10.1017/s1464793103006420,Vision in the deep sea,"ABSTRACT The deep sea is the largest habitat on earth. Its three great faunal environments – the twilight mesopelagic zone, the dark bathypelagic zone and the vast flat expanses of the benthic habitat – are home to a rich fauna of vertebrates and invertebrates. In the mesopelagic zone (150–1000 m), the down‐welling daylight creates an extended scene that becomes increasingly dimmer and bluer with depth. The available daylight also originates increasingly from vertically above, and bioluminescent point‐source flashes, well contrasted against the dim background daylight, become increasingly visible. In the bathypelagic zone below 1000 m no daylight remains, and the scene becomes entirely dominated by point‐like bioluminescence. This changing nature of visual scenes with depth – from extended source to point source – has had a profound effect on the designs of deep‐sea eyes, both optically and neurally, a fact that until recently was not fully appreciated. Recent measurements of the sensitivity and spatial resolution of deep‐sea eyes – particularly from the camera eyes of fishes and cephalopods and the compound eyes of crustaceans – reveal that ocular designs are well matched to the nature of the visual scene at any given depth. This match between eye design and visual scene is the subject of this review. The greatest variation in eye design is found in the mesopelagic zone, where dim down‐welling daylight and bioluminescent point sources may be visible simultaneously. Some mesopelagic eyes rely on spatial and temporal summation to increase sensitivity to a dim extended scene, while others sacrifice this sensitivity to localise pinpoints of bright bioluminescence. Yet other eyes have retinal regions separately specialised for each type of light. In the bathypelagic zone, eyes generally get smaller and therefore less sensitive to point sources with increasing depth. In fishes, this insensitivity, combined with surprisingly high spatial resolution, is very well adapted to the detection and localisation of point‐source bioluminescence at ecologically meaningful distances. At all depths, the eyes of animals active on and over the nutrient‐rich sea floor are generally larger than the eyes of pelagic species. In fishes, the retinal ganglion cells are also frequently arranged in a horizontal visual streak, an adaptation for viewing the wide flat horizon of the sea floor, and all animals living there. These and many other aspects of light and vision in the deep sea are reviewed in support of the following conclusion: it is not only the intensity of light at different depths, but also its distribution in space, which has been a major force in the evolution of deep‐sea vision.",W1968235860,False,0.7828618884086609

In plant communities in north central Florida, we collected species abundances in 55 0.1-ha plots in several state parks. When communities were defined narrowly to include a single phylogenetic lineage, such as Quercus, Pinus, or Ilex, neighbors tended to be less related than expected (phylogenetic overdispersion) or there was no pattern. If the same communities were defined more broadly, such as when all seed plants were included, neighbors tended to be more related than expected (phylogenetic clustering). These results provide evidence that species interactions among close relatives influence community structure, but they also show that niche conservatism is increasingly evident as communities are defined to include greater phylogenetic diversity. We also found that, as the spatial scale is increased to encompass greater environmental heterogeneity, niche conservatism emerges as the dominant pattern. We then examined patterns of trait evolution in relation to trait similarity within communities for 11 functional traits for a single phylogenetic lineage (Quercus) and for all woody plants. Among the oaks, convergent evolution of traits important for environmental filtering contributes to the observed pattern of phylogenetic overdispersion. At the broader taxonomic scale, traits tend to be conserved, giving rise to phylogenetic clustering. The shift from overdispersion to clustering can be explained by the increasing conservatism of traits at broader phylogenetic scales.",W1992335321,False,0.8445833325386047

Wild animals are tolerant of trypanosomal infections. Nagana affects individual animals, herds and socio-economic development. In susceptible animals nagana may be acute, but chronic infections are more common. The host-parasite interaction produces extensive pathology and severe anaemia. Clinically affected animals lose condition and become weak and unproductive. Nagana is often fatal and, at herd level, its impact is wide ranging. All aspects of production are depressed: fertility is impaired; milk yields, growth and work output are reduced; and the mortality rate may reduce herd size. Africa has to feed its rapidly growing human population, and animal products are a vital dietary component. However, in most tsetse areas, there is not enough meat and milk. Furthermore, animal draft power is often not available, which limits cultivation and local transport. These factors lower household incomes and retard socio-economic development. Sustainable rural development requires that nagana be controlled. This in turn needs considerable resources, whichever control strategy is adopted.",W149268883,False,0.392961710691452

We have previously defined seven monoclonal antibody (MAb) groups which recognize distinct epitopes on the mature gD-1 protein of 369 amino acids. MAb groups VII, II, and V recognize continuous epitopes at residues 11-19, 272-279, and 340-356, respectively. MAb groups I, III, IV, and VI recognize discontinuous epitopes. Recent studies have focused on epitopes I, III, and VI. Using truncated forms of gD generated by recombinant DNA methods and proteolysis, epitopes III, IV, and VI were located within amino acids 1-233. A portion of discontinuous epitope I was located in a region within residues 233-275. For this study, we used recombinant DNA methods to create mutations in the gD-1 gene and studied the effects of those mutations on gD as expressed in mammalian cells. Plasmid pRE4, containing the coding sequence of gD-1 and the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter, was transfected into mammalian cells. The expressed protein, gD-1-(pRE4), was identical in size and antigenic properties to gD-1 from infected cells. Six in-frame deletion mutations were subsequently constructed by using restriction enzymes to excise portions of the gD-1 gene. Plasmids carrying these mutated forms were transfected into cells, and the corresponding proteins were examined at 48 h posttransfection for antigenicity and glycosylation patterns. Three deletions of varying size were located downstream of residue 233. Analysis of these mutants showed that amino acids within the region 234-244 were critical for binding of DL11 (group I), but not for other MAb groups. Three other deletion mutants lost all ability to bind MAbs which recognize discontinuous epitopes. In addition, much of the gD expressed by these mutants was observed to migrate as high-molecular-weight aggregated forms in nondenaturing gels. Each of these mutations involved the loss of a cysteine residue, suggesting that disulfide linkages play an essential role in the formation of discontinuous epitopes. The extent of glycosylation of the mutant gD molecules accumulated at 48 h posttransfection suggested altered carbohydrate processing. In one case, there was evidence for increased O-linked glycosylation. Those proteins which had lost a cysteine residue as part of the deletion did not accumulate molecules processed beyond the high-mannose stage. The results suggest that carbohydrate processing during synthesis of gD is very sensitive to alterations in structure, particularly changes involving cysteine residues.",W1512493838,False,0.033787425607442856

We report here that rosetting can be mediated by several molecular mechanisms involving parasite polypeptides with M(r)s of 22,000 or 28,000, termed rosettins. Antibodies to either polypeptide disrupt rosettes in a strain-specific fashion. Rosettes of five of the seven isolates examined thus far are more easily disrpted by anti-22,000-M(r) rosettin antibodies than by anti-28,000-M(r) rosettin antibodies. Polyclonal anti-22,000-M(r) rosettin antibodies raised in mice or rabbits strongly and strain specifically stain the surface of nonfixed erythrocytes infected with late asexual stages of rosetting P. falciparum. Simultaneous antibody staining and rosetting are seen when the anti-22,000-M(r) rosettin antiserum is diluted so that only partial disruption of rosettes is obtained, confirming that the fluorescence-labelled infected erythrocytes are involved in rosetting. The 22,000-M(r) rosettin is accessible for surface iodination on erythrocytes infected with strains of rosetting parasites sensitive to anti-22,000-M(r) rosettin antibodies, whereas no labelling occurred on either normal erythrocytes or nonrosetting-P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes. Purified anti-22,000-M(r) rosettin serum immunoglobulin G immunoprecipitated three parasite-derived polypeptides with M(r)s of 22,000, 45,000 (doublet), and 50,000 from lysates of [35S]methionine-labelled, parasite-infected erythrocytes.

We found that crisis, the time of rapidly dropping parasitemia, was abrogated by splenectomy, indicating the role of spleen in parasite killing. The factors that mediate spleen-dependent immunity are not known. An earlier study in Plasmodium berghei-infected rats showed an association between increased clearance of heat-treated erythrocytes and the onset of crisis [Wyler, D. J., Quinn, T. C. & Chen, L.-T. (1982) J. Clin. Invest. 67, 1400-1404]. To determine the potential effects of different vascular beds in parasite killing, we studied the distribution of parasitized erythrocytes and bacteria in the spleens of P. chabaudi adami-infected mice during precrisis (a period of rising parasitemia) and during crisis. After intravenous injection, bacteria were localized predominantly in the marginal zone. In contrast, parasitized erythrocytes were found in the red pulp. We also found that during precrisis, a time of no immunity, the uptake of radiolabeled infected erythrocytes by the spleen was increased, not decreased. These data imply that no change occurs in the flow of parasitized erythrocytes through the spleen during the transition to an immune state (crisis).

Key challenges involve ways to deal with the collective dynamics of heterogeneous ensembles of individuals, and to scale from small spatial regions to large ones. The central issues—understanding how detail at one scale makes its signature felt at other scales, and how to relate phenomena across scales—cut across scientific disciplines and go to the heart of algorithmic development of approaches to high-speed computation.

Hoplothrips pedicularius (Haliday) (Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae), a tubuliferan thrips in which males possess greatly enlarged forelegs, lives in colonies on Stereum fungus. Females oviposit onto communal egg masses, and males fight by grasping and stabbing with their forelegs in territorial defence of oviposition areas. Prolonged escalated fights occur between males who are of similar size. Larger males usually win fights and become dominant at the oviposition area. Dominant males secure 80% of matings, and mate most frequently during oviposition periods, with an ovipositing female. Smaller, subordinate males avoid fights and attempt to 'sneak’copulations. However, they occasionally challenge the dominant male. Challenges tend to follow copulations by the subordinate male and occur more frequently between males who are of similar size. Subordinate males who eventually leave the oviposition area are larger than those who remain, have frequently challenged the dominant male, and have more frequently been stabbed. Sexual dimorphism in thrips is associated with gregariousness, claustral habitats, female‐biased sex ratios, and male winglessness. In thrips genera in which males exhibit foreleg armature, males are larger relative to females. The ecological circumstances promoting sexual dimorphism and male fighting in spatially‐structured populations are discussed.",W2119507409,False,0.7662732601165771
,Biological control of two-spotted spider mites using phytoseiid predators: I: Modelling the predator-prey interaction at the individual level,"The searching behaviour of individual predators of four phytoseiid species ( Phytoseiulus persimilis, Amblyseius p o tentillae, Amblyseius bibens, Metaseiulus occidentalis ) is investigated in relation to the two-spotted spider mite ( Tetranychus urticae ), which infests greenhouse roses. Especially the role of spider- mite webbing in the predator-prey relation is studied. Webbing interferes with searching, decreasing the rate of encounter per unit prey density. Low walking speeds and activity in webbing ensure that the predator is rarely disturbed after contact with other mites. Webbing also positively influences searching, as spider mites aggregate within the webbed area: prey density, defined here as the number of prey per square centimetre of webbed leaf area, is high, as is the rate of encounter with prey. The ability to capture a prey after tarsal contact depends on the food content of the gut, the prey-stage and, in two specific cases, the webbing; the success ratio of P. persimilis increased on a webbed substrate, that of A. potentillae decreased.Models to simulate rate of predation on the basis of the dynamics of the motivational state and the state dependent rate of successful encounter are proposed. The food content of the gut is chosen as an indicator of the motivational state. A stochastic queueing model simulates predation as accurately as a Monte Carlo model or a compound simulation model. The queueing model is preferred because of its economic use of computer time and the relatively few variables used. The model was validated in predation experiments.Systems analysis showed that the effect of temperature on the rate of predation is largely determined by its relation with the relative rate of food conversion into egg biomass and not by behavioural changes related to temperature. Also, it was shown that webbing has an important influence on the predation rate. A new model for the analysis of prey-stage preference is proposed.Predators invade the webbed leaf area after contact with the silk strands, irrespective of the presence of prey. The residence time in the prey colony is determined by prey density. Simulation of experimentally defined walking behaviour shows that predators remain in profitable prey patches by turning at the edge of the webbed leaf area. However, when predator density increases, the tendency to leave the prey colony also increases, even at high prey densities. Only A. potentillae avoided the webbed leaf area, preferring the thickest parts of the leaf ribs or other protected places on the plant.A survey of references on life history data is presented; emphasis is given to the role of food, temperature and relative humidity. Experiments by the author show that oviposition history of predatory females is a major factor in determining the actual rate of food conversion into egg biomass; and that the egg stage of the predators is very vulnerable to relative humidities below 70%, though the evapotranspiration of the plant and the hygroscopic properties of the webbing buffer this to some extent. As the juvenile mortality of the phytoseiids increases above 30°C, and that of the two-spotted spider mites above 35°C, spider-mite control at temperatures above 30°C is not effective.The four phytoseiid species are ranked on their capacities for numerical increase and predation: P. persimilis, A. bibens, M. occidentalis and A. potentillae. On capacity to survive on alternative foods they are ranked: A. potentillae, A. bibens, M. occidentalis and P. persimilis. Some trials with alternative food supply did not improve survival rates established for prevailing greenhouse conditions.The rate of increase of the webbed area per individual spider mite is quantified by experiment. This knowledge will enable continuous monitoring of the prey density during simulations of the predator-prey interactions on the population level.",W2164261297,False,0.7345092296600342

The speed of development in the immature stages increased almost linearly with the temperature. The oviposition rate appeared to be relatively stable for the first part of the adult female life, and its relationship with temperature is also linear. Female life span is extremely long; significant mortality occurs only after most eggs have been laid. Since young females have a high life expectancy and produce eggs with regular frequency at constant temperatures, maximal population increase depends largely on the duration of the life cycle, the rate of oviposition, and the sex‐ratio. The first two parameters change instantly with temperature. As a result, the intrinsic rate of increase (r m ) of A. bibens can be reliably estimated by means of the thermal sum for every temperature between 17°C and 31°C in conditions with changing temperatures. Raising the temperature improves the functioning of the predacious mite, since it both accelerates the population growth, and increases individual predation rates. Experiments on peanut plants showed that the intrinsic rate of increase is attained when the prey is sufficiently numerous on the plants. The possibility of using temperature determined maximal rates of increase to quantify eventual detrimental influences of other abiotic and biotic factors in (semi‐)natural crop conditions is discussed. Zusammenfassung Vermehrungs‐ und Raub‐Kapazität bei der Raubmilbe Amblyseius bibens (Acarina, Phytoseiidae) Der Einfluß von Umwelttemperaturen von 17–30° C auf das Fortpflanzungsvermögen der Raubmilbe Amblyseius bibens wurde mittels Prüfungen auf Blattscheiben mit der Spinnmilbe Tetranychus neocaledonicus als Beutetier bestimmt. Die Entwicklungsgeschwindigkeit erwies sich als direkt proportional zur Temperatur. Die Eiproduktion war sehr regelmäßig bei jungen Weibchen. Auch die Eiablagegeschwindigkeit stand in geradem Verhältnis zur Temperatur. Temperaturschwankungen spiegeln sich in entsprechenden Änderungen der Reproduktionsvorgänge wider. Weil die Weibchen außerordentlich lang leben, wird die spezifische Vermehrungsrate (r m ) dieser Raubmilbe hauptsächlich von der Entwicklungsdauer, der täglichen Eiablage der Weibchen sowie dem Weibchenanteil bestimmt. Eine Temperaturzunahme fördert die Raubkapazität der Milbe zweifach: sie beschleunigt die Vermehrung und erhöht den Nahrungsverbrauch. Zwei Prüfungen auf mit Spinnmilben besetzten Erdnußpflanzen in Töpfen zeigten, daß die Masse der Raubmilbe entsprechend den kalkulierten Fortpflanzungswerten zunehmen kann. Die mögliche Anwendung der von der Temperatur bedingten spezifischen Vermehrungsrate zur Bestimmung anderer klimatischer oder biotischer Einflüsse auf den Massenwechsel der Raubmilbe wird erörtert.

La vitesse de développement apparaît directement proportionelle à la température. La ponte quotidienne est très régulière diez les jeunes femelles et le taux d'oviposition est influencé par la température aussi d'une façon linéaire. Des fluctuations de la température sont suivies momentanément par des changements conformes dans cettes deux fonctions reproductives. Par suite d'une longévité exceptionelle des femelles de cette espèce le taux intrinsèque d'accroisement (r m ) est déterminé largément par la durée totale de développement des femelles, la ponte quotidienne et le sex‐ratio. Une élévation de la température améliorera le fonctionnement de l'acarien prédateur parce qu'elle accélère l'accroisement de la population et, au même temps, augment la consommation par individu. Deux expériences sur plantes d'arachide en pot pullulées des araignées rouges ont démontré qu'une population du prédateur s'accroît conformément au taux intrinsèque calculé au départ des résultats sur feuilles détachées.

Several coefficients are incompatible with suggested admissibility conditions of the minimum‐maximum value (A 13, A 16, A 27, A 28, A 29, A 31 ), symmetry (A 1, A 2, A 13, A 16, A 26 ), discrimination between positive and negative association (A 27, A 28, A 31 ) or monotonicity with (χ 2 ) (A 19, to A 24 ); A 17 yields very low and erratic values. As a result, 23 coefficients were excluded and the remaining 20 measures were subjected to an empirical trial on interspecific association data among fungi of the genus Chaetomium, with the use of a cluster analysis. The classification produced five main clusters of related coefficients, with several subgroups. It was then demonstrated that representative indices from different clusters yield different dendrograms of interspecific association among Chaetomium, and A 34, A 14, possibly also A 36 and A 40 seemed to be less sensible. A set of measures that generally work well (at least in the interspecific association) comprises A 4 (Jaccard), A 4 (Dice‐Sφrensen), A 7 (Kulczyński), A 11 (Driver‐Kroeber‐Ochiai) and, with some reservation A 30 (Pearson tetrachoric) and A 32 (Baroni‐Urbani‐Buser). For some purposes, however, other ‘admissible’ coefficients would be more optimal, and the choice of a measure should be related to the nature of the data. It is tentatively suggested that three or so alternative coefficients be used and the results compared on the same data basis; moreover, significance tests on association should be carried out whenever possible.",W1966166469,False,0.21579459309577942

Before that time, systematics was not at the forefront of the biological sciences, and few scientists considered phylogenetic relationships when investigating evolutionary questions. By contrast, systematic biology is now one of the most vigorous disciplines in biology, and the use of phylogenies not only is requisite in macroevolutionary studies but also has been applied to a wide range of topics and fields that no one could possibly have envisioned 30 years ago. My message is simple: phylogenies are fundamental to comparative biology, but they are not the be-all and end-all. Phylogenies are powerful tools for understanding the past, but like any tool, they have their limitations. In addition, phylogenies are much more informative about pattern than they are about process.

The unsteady water tables are assumed to behave as a continuous succession of steady states with the flux through the water table given by the sum of components due to rainfall and evaporation through the soil surface and due to water released or taken up by the unsaturated soil above the water table. A simple steady‐state drainage equation is used for the relationship between water‐table height and flux, and the specific yield is assumed to have a constant value. The simulated seasonal water table using estimated hydraulic soil properties and meteorological records for a field site agreed with available dip‐well observations. The water table was much lower than the ditch‐water level during the summer months. The sensitivity of simulated results to model parameters is demonstrated.",W2029569499,False,0.004134786315262318

Comparison among species is the most common technique for testing hypotheses of how organisms are adapted to their environments, but standard statistical tests like regression should not be used with species data. Such tests assume independence of data points, but related species often share traits by common descent rather than through independent adaptation. CAIC uses a phylogeny of the species in the data set to partition the variance among species into independent comparisons (technically, linear contrasts), each comparison being made at a different node in the phylogeny. There are two partitioning procedures--one used when all variables are continuous, the other when one variable is discrete. The resulting comparisons can be analysed validly in standard statistical packages to test hypotheses about correlated evolution among traits, to estimate parameters such as allometric exponents, and to compare rates of evolution. Previous versions of the package have already been used widely; this version is simpler to use and works on a wider range of machines.

We tested these ideas by comparing the extent to which coexistence of dabbling ducks on breeding and wintering grounds depended on differences in body size which, in turn, reflect differences in prey size. Species of dabbling ducks that differ in body size by less than a factor of 1.2 co-occurred less frequently than expected by chance during the breeding season when duck assemblages are characterized by low dominance (i.e., the fractional abundances of species are roughly similar). In winter, when duck assemblages are characterized by high dominance (i.e., a few abundant species and many rarer ones), the pattern of species co-occurrence in relation to differences in body size could not be discerned from that which might occur by chance. This implies that competition for invertebrate prey, at least, is unlikely during winter. These results contrast with data from assemblages of other sexually reproducing vertebrate species, and with recent theories which predict that species' assortment patterns should be more regular than random in assemblages characterized by high dominance. Our results are consistent with the idea that communities of dabbling ducks are assembled, except during winter, according to some limiting size similarity and are influenced more by interspecific interactions than by chance.",W1963843641,False,0.8797605633735657

Ricklefs,"Ricklefs (2003) has presented a thoughtful critique of the two modes of speciation discussed in my recent book ( Hubbell 2001a ). His main point is that under point mutation speciation, a plethora of species is produced with extremely short lifespans, whereas under random fission speciation, lifespans are too long, particularly in large metacommunities. The issue is easily resolved if one regards point mutation speciation and random fission speciation as the theoretical extremes of a speciation continuum. The mean lifespan of a species in the theory depends upon the size of the species population at its origination. If initial population sizes are fairly small, but not as small as the extreme of individual‐founded lineages as under point mutation, then intermediate distributions of species lifespans are obtained. To examine this further, I consider a third model of speciation that I call “peripheral isolate speciation.” There should be a signature of peripheral isolate speciation in the distribution of metacommunity relative species abundance, just as there is in the case of point mutation speciation and random fission speciation.

https://doi.org/10.2307/1542811,A dynamical model of communities and a new species-abundance distribution,"It is known to many field biologists that biosurveys of natural communities tend to produce a J-shaped curve when the numbers of species are plotted against abundance. In other words, when the number of species of abundance k is plotted against k (running from 1 to some large number), the resulting distribution peaks at the lowest abundance, then forms a concave ramp as it approaches zero at the far end of the abundance axis. Does this distribution represent a single formula operating behind the scenes, or does it represent several formulas, appropriate for different types of community? Or does it represent no particular formula at all? The research reported here has three components: (1) The analysis of a new dynamical system that simulates multispecies communities (producing J-curves in the process) and the derivation of the ""logistic-J"" distribution, as the underlying community equilibrium curve; (2) the summary of a general theory of sampling as a bridge between natural communities and samples of them; (3) the evaluation of extant proposals for species-abundance distributions by application of a general theory of sampling or by cross-comparison via 100 biosurveys randomly selected from the literature.",W1935490393,False,0.813880980014801

Six alternative models have been tested. They range in complexity from the logistic curve to an iterative model that takes into account the initial age distribution, and effects of age, density and density change on natality, mortality and size. This complex model is the only one that provides a fair representation of observed events in experimental Daphnia populations. Several independent areas of agreement between observations and model provide assurance that the observed fit is not merely fortuitous. The most important relations determining population growth form in this system are those between (1) natality and age, density and density change and between (2) size and individual age. Comparisons between the models emphasize that, in most organisms, the populational effects of different age and size classes can not be considered negligible in assessing population dynamics.

Karl Pearson (1894) investigated the problem and developed equations for the purpose; but found them unsolvable as the ‘majority [of the relations] lead to exponential equations the solution of which seems more beyond the wit of man than that of a numerical equation even of the ninth order’. He did indeed evolve an equation of this order and used it to analyse a few bimodal distributions, but the arithmetic involved was very laborious. Later he (Pearson, 1914) gives a table for ‘Constants of normal curve from moments of tail about stump ’which, as he describes in the introduction, occasionally permits a rough analysis of a distribution which is known to be bimodal. This method is much more rapid than the solution of the nonic equation, but ‘owing to the paucity of material in tails and corresponding irregularity there will be large probable errors’. Gottschalk (1948) discusses the question and shows that inthe special case where the bimodal distribution is symmetrical comparatively simple solutions can be found.",W1980609237,False,0.13944168388843536

During this time they were fed a weekly ration of nymphs of the mayfly Baetis tricaudatus and were weighed regularly. Compared with a group of control stoneflies not exposed to trout, the stressed animals consumed a greater (average 40%) proportion of their body weight per week, yet they maintained a similar growth rate, and more died. Although stoneflies moved for the same total amount of time in the two treatments, the speed of crawling was significantly greater (2.5X) in the presence of trout. Under both treatments, the growth of individual stoneflies was highly variable, with the amount of mayfly prey consumed weekly ranging from 14.3 to 67.3 % of initial stonefly wet body weight. Individual stoneflies, however, were highly consistent in the amount of prey eaten each week. We conclude that presence of the trout increased the metabolic rate of the stoneflies and possibly also decreased their assimilation efficiency.

https://doi.org/10.1201/9780824743239-4,The Structure and Function of Skin,"I. INTRODUCTION The skin is the largest organ of the body, accounting for more than 10% of body mass, and the one that enables the body to interact most intimately with its environment. Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic illustration of the skin. In essence, the skin consists of four layers: the stratum corneum (nonviable epidermis), the remaining layers of the epidermis (viable epidermis), dermis, and subcutaneous tissues. There are also several associated appendages: hair follicles, sweat ducts, apocrine glands, and nails. Many of the functions of the skin can be classified as essential to survival of the body bulk of mammals and humans in a relatively hostile environment. In a general context, these functions may be classified as protective, maintaining homeostasis, or sensing. The importance of the protective and homeostatic role of the skin is illustrated in one context by its barrier property. This allows the survival of humans in an environment of variable temperature; water content (humidity and bathing); and the presence of environmental dangers, such as chemicals, bacteria, allergens, fungi, and radiation. In a second context, the skin is a major organ for maintaining the homeostasis of the body, especially in terms of its composition, heat regulation, blood pressure control, and excretory roles. It has been argued that the basal metabolic rate of animals differing in size should be scaled to the surface area of the body to maintain a constant temperature through the skin's thermoregulatory control (1). Third, the skin is a major sensory organ in terms of sensing environmental influences, such as heat, pressure, pain, allergen, and microorganism entry. Finally, the skin is an organ that is in a continual state of regeneration and repair. To fulfillFigure 1 Components of the epidermis and dermis of human skin.",W1502904746,False,0.08480023592710495

Transverse ridges on the upper surface of the gill arches form a system of channels in which food particles appear to be retained. These ridges are formed by a fleshy interconnection between the middle part of the gill arch and the bony parts of its gill rakers. Muscles attached to the rakers, present only on the lateral edge of the gill arch, indicate movability of the lateral bony raker element. If the fish is foraging on particles smaller than the channel diameter, movement of these gill rakers probably adjusts the sieve by reducing the channel diameter of the opposite channel. Selectivity of bream depends on available size classes of zooplanktons and changes in selectivity are attributed to adjustment of the branchial sieve. The channel model has been tested with feeding experiments and X-ray cinematography. The reconstructed paths of marked food particles show that particles follow the hypothesized path. Particle retention occurred mainly at the expected medial site of the arches. Our study strongly supports the channel model of particle retention.",W1999593146,False,0.5506567358970642

Past temperature and moisture parameters were estimated using modern analogues and ‘plant functional types’ transfer-function methods for three pollen records obtained from different localities within the paleolake basin. The comparison of these methods shows that they provide generally similar climate signals, with the exception of the Bölling. Comparison of pollen- and chironomid-based temperature of the warmest month reconstructions generally agree, except during the Bölling. Major abrupt changes associated with the Oldest Dryas/Bölling, Alleröd/Younger Dryas, and the Younger Dryas/Preboreal transitions were quantified as well as other minor fluctuations related to the cold events (e.g., Preboreal oscillation). The temperature of the warmest month increased by ∼5°C at the start of Bölling, and by 1.5°�""3°C at the onset of the Holocene, while it fell by ca. 3° to 4°C at the beginning of Younger Dryas. The comparative analysis of the results based on the three Lautrey cores have highlighted significant differences in the climate reconstructions related to the location of each core, underlining the caution that is needed when studying single cores not taken from deepest part of lake basins.",W1968363986,False,0.16720490157604218

This multivariate statistical technique was applied to a spatial array of modern pollen and climatic data in order to derive a set of mathematical transfer functions. These transform the fossil pollen spectra directly into quantitative estimates of past climatic values. The basic sequence of climatic events that is reconstructed is in general agreement with previous studies of postglacial climates in the Midwest, but quantitative estimates for certain of the variables, e.g., temperature and precipitation, are given for the first time. Fossil pollen from three cores collected from lakes in Wisconsin and Minnesota allow a preliminary reconstruction of past east-west and north-south gradients of the climatic variables. Because changes in the circulation patterns in midlatitudes are the principal mechanism causing fluctuations in temperature and precipitation, past records of the atmospheric circulation are reconstructed along with records of temperature and rainfall. The time series derived show that the most pronounced climatic change indicated in Wisconsin and Minnesota occurred at the end of the Pleistocene (the beginning of the Holocene). This change is particularly evident in the climatic variables related to temperature, which rose ca. 3.3°C. A decrease in snowfall also occurred. During the Holocene, the most marked change appears in the results from Kirchner Marsh, where the amount of dry western air began to increase and the precipitation to decrease about 9500 B.P. A reversal of these changes occurred about 5000 B.P. In contrast, relatively little change occurred among the reconstructed values from Wisconsin; a marked east-west precipitation gradient, therefore, developed in this region of the Midwest from 9500 to 5000 B.P.",W2071258578,False,0.14172467589378357

We tend to think of animal function in chemical terms and talk of water, salts, proteins, enzymes, oxygen, energy, and so on. We should not forget, however, that physical laws are equally important, for they determine rates of diffusion and heat transfer, transfer of force and momentum, the strength of structures, the dynamics of locomotion, and other aspects of the functioning of animal bodies. Physical laws provide possibilities and opportunities for an organism, yet they also impose constraints, setting limits to what is physically possible. This book aims to give an understanding of these rules because of their profound implications when we deal with animals of widely different size and scale. The reader will find that the book raises many questions. Remarkable and puzzling information makes it read a little like a detective story, but the last chapter, instead of giving the final solution, neither answers all questions nor provides one great unifying principle.",W1763240259,False,0.08079446852207184

Although this conceptualization of an equivalence between the two procedures may be intuitively appealing, it is mathematically incorrect. If residuals are obtained from the pooled within-groups regression coefficient ( b w ), an analysis of variance on the residuals results in an inflated α-level. If the regression coefficient for the total sample combined into one group ( b T ) is used, ANOVA on the residuals yields an inappropriately conservative test. In either case, analysis of variance of residuals fails to provide a correct test, because the significance test in analysis of covariance requires consideration of both b w and b T, unlike analysis of residuals. It is recommended that the significance test of treatment effects in analysis of covariance be conceptualized, not as an analysis of residuals, but as a comparison of models whose parameters are estimated by the principle of least squares.

The ratio index correlated with body size, which weakened the strength of conclusions that could be drawn. The slope-adjusted ratio index requires an independent and large data set with which to generate the expected values, and was likewise sensitive to body size.

It is concluded that if the error rate of the X variable is thought to be more than a third of that on the Y variable, then the reduced major axis method is preferable; otherwise the least squares technique is acceptable.

The Kingman coalescent model is used to describe the time structure of the ancestral tree. We recover information about the unknown true ancestral coalescent tree, population size, and the overall mutation rate from temporally spaced data, that is, from nucleotide sequences gathered at different times, from different individuals, in an evolving haploid population. We briefly discuss the methodological implications and show what can be inferred, in various practically relevant states of prior knowledge.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence (partial ND2, tRNA Trp and partial tRNA Ala ) was obtained from 293 Phrynocephalus sampled from 34 sites across the plateau. Partitioned Bayesian and maximum parsimony phylogenetic analyses revealed that P. vlangalii and two other proposed species ( P. erythrus and P. putjatia ) together form a monophyletic mtDNA clade which, in contrast with previous studies, does not include P. theobaldi and P. zetangensis. The main P. vlangalli clade comprises seven well‐supported lineages that correspond to distinct geographical areas with little or no overlap, and share a most recent common ancestor at 5.06 ± 0.68 million years ago (mya). This is much older than intraspecific lineages in other Tibetan animal groups. Analyses of molecular variance indicated that most of the observed genetic variation occurred among populations/regions implying long‐term interruption of maternal gene flow. A combined approach based on tests of population expansion, estimation of node dates, and significance tests on clade areas indicated that phylogeographical structuring has been primarily shaped by three main periods of plateau uplift during the Pliocene and Pleistocene, specifically 3.4 mya, 2.5 mya and 1.7 mya. These periods corresponded to the appearance of several mountain ranges that formed physical barriers between lineages. Populations from the Qaidam Basin are shown to have undergone major demographic and range expansions in the early Pleistocene, consistent with colonization of areas previously covered by the huge Qaidam palaeolake, which desiccated at this time.

However, concerns with basing evolutionary interpretations on mtDNA results alone have been voiced since the inception of such studies. Recently, some authors have suggested that the potential problems with mtDNA are so great that inferences about population structure and species limits are unwarranted unless corroborated by other evidence, usually in the form of nuclear gene data. Here we review the relative merits of mitochondrial and nuclear phylogeographical studies, using birds as an exemplar class of organisms. A review of population demographic and genetic theory indicates that mitochondrial and nuclear phylogeographical results ought to concur for both geographically unstructured populations and for populations that have long histories of isolation. However, a relatively common occurrence will be shallow, but geographically structured mtDNA trees—without nuclear gene corroboration—for populations with relatively shorter periods of isolation. This is expected because of the longer coalescence times of nuclear genes (approximately four times that of mtDNA); such cases do not contradict the mtDNA inference of recent isolation and evolutionary divergence. Rather, the nuclear markers are more lagging indicators of changes in population structure. A review of the recent literature on birds reveals the existence of relatively few cases in which nuclear markers contradict mitochondrial markers in a fashion not consistent with coalescent theory. Preliminary information from nuclear genes suggests that mtDNA patterns will prove to be robust indicators of patterns of population history and species limits. At equilibrium, mitochondrial loci are generally a more sensitive indicator of population structure than are nuclear loci, and mitochondrial estimates of F ST ‐like statistics are generally expected to exceed nuclear ones. Hence, invoking behavioural or ecological explanations of such differences is not parsimonious. Nuclear genes will prove important for quantitative estimates of the depths of haplotype trees, rates of population growth and values of gene flow.",W1945381458,False,0.7889028787612915

The analysis of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variation in 1043 bp of the cytochrome b gene and in 918 bp of the noncoding control region was performed with phylogenetic approaches. Our results suggest that both the duplicated control region and cytochrome b evolve at a similar rate in this species. Phylogenetic analysis showed that V. berus is divided into three major mitochondrial lineages, probably resulting from an Italian, a Balkan and a Northern (from France to Russia) refugial area in Eastern Europe, near the Carpathian Mountains. In addition, the Northern clade presents an important substructure, suggesting two sequential colonization events in Europe. First, the continent was colonized from the three main refugial areas mentioned above during the Lower-Mid Pleistocene. Second, recolonization of most of Europe most likely originated from several refugia located outside of the Mediterranean peninsulas (Carpathian region, east of the Carpathians, France and possibly Hungary) during the Mid-Late Pleistocene, while populations within the Italian and Balkan Peninsulas fluctuated only slightly in distribution range, with larger lowland populations during glacial times and with refugial mountain populations during interglacials, as in the present time.

We show that, in a population of constant size, the sample distribution of pairwise differences will typically deviate substantially from the geometric distribution expected, because the history of coalescent events in a single sample of genes imposes a substantial correlation on pairwise differences. Consequently, a goodness-of-fit test of observed pairwise differences to the geometric distribution, which assumes that each pairwise comparison is independent, is not a valid test of the hypothesis that the genes were sampled from a panmictic population of constant size. In an exponentially growing population in which the product of the current population size and the growth rate is substantially larger than one, our analytical and simulation results show that most coalescent events occur relatively early and in a restricted range of times. Hence, the ""gene tree"" will be nearly a ""star phylogeny"" and the distribution of pairwise differences will be nearly a Poisson distribution. In that case, it is possible to estimate r, the population growth rate, if the mutation rate, mu, and current population size, N0, are assumed known.

The estimates of growth rate are biased upwards, especially when 4Neμ is low; there is also a slight upwards bias in the estimate of 4Neμ itself due to correlation between the parameters. This bias cannot be attributed solely to Metropolis-Hastings sampling but appears to be an inherent property of the estimator and is expected to appear in any approach which estimates growth rate from genealogy structure.

By this time qualitative changes in the chemical composition of the host tissue had also occurred. Trees were defined as resistant or susceptible depending on whether they survived beetle attack under natural conditions. The composition of the acetone-soluble extracts was similar for the constitutive tissue of resistant and susceptible trees, but the total quantity of acetone extractives of reaction tissue was higher in resistant trees. The ability of trees to respond to fungal inoculation is diminished by mass attack. Trees responded more extensively to inoculation prior to, than during, aggregation under field conditions. An experiment was conducted to simulate this relationship under controlled conditions by examining the effect of multiple fungal inoculations on the production of monoterpenes during the wound response. Individual trees showed a weaker quantitative response on stem sections administered high inoculation densities than on stem sections administered only a single inoculation.

Since these maternal antibodies result mainly from thymus‐dependent immune responses which have undergone immune maturation through somatic hypermutations, they represent the highest quality of the collective maternal immunological experience. Maternal antibodies not only confer passive immunity as long as the newborn's immune system has not fully developed, but also exert an active stimulation as indicated by their regulatory influence on isotype expression, long‐term idiotypic alterations, determination of the adult B and T cell repertoire, induction of antigen reactive IgM as well as an affinity enhancement of a proportion of early primary antibodies. The fact that several of these features can only be induced during limited sensitive periods shortly after birth is reminiscent of the behavioural imprinting as defined by Konrad Lorenz. We therefore propose that during early ontogeny there is an immunological imprinting phase with characteristics analogous to behavioural imprinting: (i) the internal imprinting effect is induced by external signals, (ii) in contrast to normal learning, immunological imprinting is also only possible during certain development phases and (iii) it is characterised by an (almost) irreversible result. Hence, if particular immunological experiences are only possible during such sensitive phases, maternal immunoglobulins and consequently the mother's immunological experience is of prime importance for the start of the ontogenetic development of the immune system.",W1509280320,False,0.007172366138547659

Such maternal effects may be mediated by transmission of antibodies and antioxidants. Mothers should adjust allocation of maternal substances depending on embryonic sex because of differences in reproductive value, potentially dependent on paternal genetic effects as reflected by secondary sexual characters. We manipulated sexual attractiveness of male barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) and investigated maternal investment in eggs in relation to offspring sex. Mothers allocated more antibodies against a pathogen to eggs with a daughter than a son. However, concentration of antioxidants was independent of embryonic sex. Sex-dependent allocation was independent of paternal attractiveness. Thus, mothers adjusted allocation of substances to offspring in a complex manner, that may be part of a strategy of favouritism of daughters, which have larger mortality than sons. Such effects may have important consequences for secondary and tertiary sex ratios, but also for ontogeny of adult phenotype.",W1557487166,False,0.048421118408441544

We have therefore investigated the feasibility of protecting hatchling broilers via maternal transfer of protective antibodies from hens to their offspring. Oral infection of broiler breeder hens with 20,000 sporulated Eimeria maxima oocysts caused production of antibodies which were passed into the egg yolk and subsequently to hatchlings. The level of specific antibodies in the yolks to unsporulated oocysts, sporulated oocysts, merozoites, and gametocytes was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The levels in yolks of antibodies to all developmental stages peaked 3 to 4 weeks after infection of the hens. Groups of 10 hatchlings were challenged at 3 days of age by oral infection with 100 sporulated E. maxima oocysts. In the first experiment, the mean 4-day (days 6 to 9 post-infection) total number of oocysts excreted in the feces of chicks from eggs collected 3 weeks after infection of the hens was (0.6 +/- 0.4) x 10(6) (mean +/- standard error) compared with (9.9 +/- 1.4) x 10(6) for the progeny of uninfected hens, which represents a greater than 90% reduction. However, oocyst excretion by chicks from eggs collected 7 or 8 weeks after infection of the hens was only 47 or 68% lower than control values, reflecting declining levels of protective antibodies. In a second experiment, in which the hens were somewhat older and pretreated by intramuscular injection of saline in the emulsifying agent, Arlacel A, the period for which protective antibodies were transferred to hatchlings was prolonged. Thus, oocyst excretion by challenged hatchlings from eggs collected for an 8-week period after infection of the hens was more than 90% lower than oocyst excretion by control chicks, and even hatchlings of eggs collected 19 weeks after infection of the hens showed a 60% reduction in oocyst output. In both experiments, the levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to all developmental stages in yolks or hatchling sera were very strongly correlated with maternally derived immunity to E. maxima. In contrast, parasite-specific IgM or IgA was not detectable, either in egg yolk or egg white. These results demonstrate the ability of IgG antibodies to protect against E. maxima in poultry, thus raising the possibility of using protective maternally derived IgG antibodies to identify potentially protective parasite antigens and indicating the feasibility of using maternal immunization as a means for parasite control.",W1884908391,False,0.247523695230484

Transmission of carotenoids to the eggs may affect development and maturation of immunity in offspring, but carotenoids may be available to females in limiting amounts. Females may thus transfer carotenoids to the eggs differentially in relation to the reproductive value of the offspring as affected by sexual ornamentation of their father. In this study of maternal allocation of carotenoids to the eggs in the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica), females whose immune system had been experimentally challenged with an antigen had smaller lutein concentrations in their eggs than controls. We manipulated the size of a secondary sexual character (tail length) of males, and analysed the effect of manipulation on allocation of lutein to eggs by their vaccinated mates. Contrary to our prediction based on parental allocation theory, mates of tail-shortened males had a larger lutein concentration in their eggs compared with those of control and tail-elongated males. According to previous studies, offspring of short-tailed males have larger exposure and/or susceptibility to parasites. A larger lutein concentration in the eggs of females mated to males with experimentally reduced ornaments may thus reflect adaptive maternal strategies to enhance offspring viability.",W1963995307,False,0.8398839235305786

By using rabbit antiserum raised against recombinant CheY-SO7', Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of sporulated oocysts of all seven major species of chicken coccidia showed that all species tested contained proteins characteristic of the B class of antigens, of which CheY-SO7' is representative. It seems likely that a single B antigen could protect chickens against severe coccidiosis caused by infection with any of these Eimeria species. Although chicks exposed to prolonged, natural infection develop antibodies to B antigen, active immunization of young chicks with a protective dose of CheY-SO7' does not elicit a humoral antibody response, suggesting that the partial protection results from cell-mediated effector mechanisms. In addition, the cross-protective nature of the immunity indicates that the response to B antigen is different from that induced by natural infection, which elicits a species-specific immunity.

Reactive aldehyde groups were strategically introduced into the terminal residues of the polysaccharides by the controlled periodate oxidation of the native groups B and C polysaccharides and of the group A polysaccharide previously modified by the reduction of its terminal reducing N-acetyl-mannosamine residue. This produced essentially monovalent polysaccharide molecules, which were subsequently covalently linked to tetanus toxoid by means of reductive amination. Although the groups A and C polysaccharides proved to be poor immunogens in rabbits and mice, their tetanus toxoid conjugates produced high levels of polysaccharide-specific antibodies in both animals. By contrast, even in the form of its tetanus toxoid conjugate, the group B polysaccharide failed to elicit homologous polysaccharide-specific antibodies in either animal; a major proportion of the antibodies actually produced had a specificity for the linkage area of the conjugate. This evidence is compatible with the hypothesis of the poor immunogenicity of the group B polysaccharide being structure related.

During this acclimatization, these molluscs do not show any extracellular anisosmotic regulatory power except for potassium, the blood level of which is regulated at the concentration it has in the blood of sea water aclimated animals.During rapid acclimatization to diluted media, a transistory hyperosmotic state can be recorded in both blood and perivisceral fluid of the two bivalves species (Glycymeris glycymeris, and Mytilus edulis) but not in the blood of the polyplacophora Acanthochitona discrepans. This hyperosmotic state, which can last for about 96 hours in both bivalves when placed suddenly in diluted media, is due to the ability of those molluscs to isolate themselves from the external medium by closing their valves tightly. This ""shell-closing"" mechanism may help the animals in withstanding a sudden osmotic stress but it cannot contribute to the osmotic regulation observed in these species.In the studied species, it is the cell which has to cope with the osmotic stress and amino acids play a part in the cellular osmoregulation process. Taurine also appears as an important osmotic effector. Our results show that the concentration of the intracellular free amino acids and of taurine is higher in the muscle of sea water acclimated animals than in the same tissue taken from animals adapted to 50% sea water.

https://doi.org/10.1086/283861,Dispersal and the Stability of Predator-Prey Interactions,"A predator-prey interaction between spatially dispersed populations can be considered as many local interactions connected by dispersal. Even when the local subsystems (cells) quickly become extinct in isolation, an ensemble of interconnected cells can, under certain conditions, persist much longer. These conditions include: (1) sufficiently low exchange rates among cells; or (2) a sufficiently high level of environmental stochasticity (noise), either of which can prevent local populations from becoming synchronized; or (3) a large number of cells within the system. Computer simulations based on a broadly applicable predator-prey model demonstrate the efficacy of the conditions 1-3; neither spatial structure (texture) nor density-dependent dispersal are additionally required to obtain long-term persistence. The critical problem of avoiding synchrony in a spatially contiguous, locally unstable system can apparently be solved by size alone. If the system is large enough, it should tend to fragment into two or more hypercell subsystems with the low exchange rates that permit these subsystems to remain out of phase with each other. Environmental noise that is spatially correlated on scales somewhat smaller than the size of the system may also generate or help maintain the hypercells. These features create a mosaic of fluctuating subpopulations that can yield remarkably constant population densities for the system as a whole.",W1974372888,False,0.7279099822044373

We formulate a mechanistic model that describes how secondary dispersal by wind is affected by seed traits, wind conditions and obstacles to seed movement. The model simulates the movement paths of individual seeds and can be fully specified using independently measured parameters. We develop an explicit version of the model that uses a spatially explicit representation of obstacle patterns, and also an aggregated version that uses probability distributions to model seed retention at obstacles and seed movement between obstacles. The aggregated version is computationally efficient and therefore suited to large‐scale simulations. It provides a very good approximation of the explicit version ( R 2 &gt; 0.99) if initial seed positions vary randomly relative to the obstacle pattern. To validate the model, we conducted a field experiment in which we released seeds of seven South African Proteaceae species that differ in seed size and morphology into an arena in which we systematically varied obstacle patterns. When parameterized with maximum likelihood estimates obtained from independent measurements, the explicit model version explained 70–77% of the observed variation in the proportion of seeds dispersed over 25 m and 67–69% of the observed variation in the direction of seed dispersal. The model tended to underestimate dispersal rates, possibly due to the omission of turbulence from the model, although this could also be explained by imprecise estimation of one model parameter (the aerodynamic roughness length). Our analysis of the aggregated model predicts a unimodal relationship between the distance of secondary dispersal by wind and seed size. The model can also be used to identify species with the potential for long‐distance seed transport by secondary wind dispersal. The validated model expands the domain of mechanistic dispersal models, contributes to a functional understanding of seed dispersal, and provides a tool for predicting the distances that seeds move.",W1974258151,False,0.855102002620697
https://doi.org/10.1086/374191,The Evolutionary Ecology of Sprouting in Woody Plants,"Woody plants may be killed by severe disturbance or resprout from vegetative tissue. Sprouters can persist at a site through several generations of nonsprouters. Differences in sprouting behavior are therefore important for understanding vegetation dynamics, extinction risks, and woody plant management. Although sprouting appears not to be uniquely correlated with many other intrinsic attributes, such as specific leaf area or breeding systems, a clear correlate is reduced seedling aboveground growth rates from sprouters allocating more to belowground structures. Consequently, sprouters tend to have low seedling recruitment rates, and saplings take longer to reach maturity. Sprouters also tend to have lower seed output than nonsprouters, but comparative studies have seldom taken other trait differences such as plant size into account. Added to these trade‐offs between persistence and recruitment, sprouters are often multistemmed and shorter than related nonsprouters and may be outcompeted by them when disturbances are rare. Since sprouters tend to have long generation times, damped demographic trends, and gene flow across generations, it has been suggested that their speciation rates would be low. The available data, primarily from fire‐prone Gondwanan shrublands in South Africa, show no strong differences in speciation rates of related sprouters versus seeders. This indicates that ecological factors are important determinants of the evolution of fire life histories. Analysis of disturbance regimes indicates a fundamental ecological correlate: sprouters are favored where disturbance regimes are frequent and severe in comparison to regrowth rates. To bridge the gap between ecology and evolution, data are needed on the genetical differences between related species with contrasting sprouter life histories.",W1988048216,False,0.8112382292747498

https://doi.org/10.1086/284588,Canalization Versus Developmental Conversion in a Spatially Variable Environment,"A model is presented for the evolution of developmental control in a spatially variable environment. Individuals are assumed to disperse at random into one of two patches (one harsh and the other benign) and use one of three developmental strategies for the production of one of two discrete morphological types. Two of the strategies are unconditional (develop as either the stress-tolerant or the nontolerant morph), and the third strategy depends on the environment. Invasion criteria are used to determine the conditions under which each of the three pure strategies are evolutionarily stable and the conditions under which the population is expected to contain some mixture of these strategies at equilibrium. The results demonstrate that environmental control of development requires a cost to the stress-tolerant morphology, and that the average probability of making the right choice is greater than 50%. The range of patch frequencies over which environmental control is stable increases with increases in these two parameters. The results also suggest that the two morphs may be maintained by a mixture of unconditional strategies (i.e., genetically determined polymorphism) for a narrow range of patch frequencies. Unlike the environmentally induced dimorphism, however, the genetically determined dimorphism requires for its maintenance that the morphs compete within the patches for resources. Finally, the results suggest that a mixture of genetic and environmental control is an evolutionarily stable state under some conditions. These conditions are the same as those required for the maintenance of genetically determined dimorphism, except that the average probability of making the right choice must be greater than 50%. Under mixed control, some fraction of the population shows canalized development and the remaining fraction shows developmental conversion when exposed to the appropriate cue. That such a mixture of strategies could persist in evolutionary time might explain the results of some studies that indicate partial genetic and partial environmental control of phenotypes.",W1985230946,False,0.6499013900756836
https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/23.1.47,Developmental Plasticity: Developmental Conversion<i>versus</i>Phenotypic Modulation,"The developmental mechanisms by which the environment may alter the phenotype during development are reviewed. Developmental plasticity may be of two forms: developmental conversion or phenotypic modulation. In developmental conversion, organisms use specific environmental cues to activate alternative genetic programs controlling development. These alternative programs may either lead to alternative morphs, or may lead to the decision to activate a developmental arrest. In phenotypic modulation, nonspecific phenotypic variation results from environmental influences on rates or degrees of expression of the developmental program, but the genetic programs controlling development are not altered. Modulation, which is not necessarily adaptive, is probably the common form of environmentally induced phenotypic variation in higher organisms, and adaptiveness of phenotypic plasticity therefore cannot be assumed unless specific genetic mechanisms can be demonstrated. The genetic mechanisms by which developmental plasticity may evolve are reviewed, and the relationship between developmental plasticity and evolutionary plasticity are examined.",W1978416749,False,0.05903904139995575

F, progeny of crosses between the selected lines within each size category showed (a) a reduction in preadult viability in large lines relative to control and small lines when they were cultured at medium or high density in competition with a standard mutant marked competitor stock, and (b) an increase in larval development time in large lines relative to control and small lines. Natural selection for increased body size in adults may therefore be opposed by adverse effects on larval viability. The results are discussed in terms of the developmental mechanisms probably responsible for the change in body size. The preadult survival of the large and control lines was measured at three different temperatures, and there was no evidence for a significant interaction between size and temperature. The observed evolutionary increase in body size in response to reduced temperature in Drosophila must therefore involve either different genes from those subject to selection for size at a single temperature, or a fitness component other than preadult survival.

Substantial ""natural"" heritabilities were found when wild-caught flies from one population were compared to their laboratory-reared offspring. Natural heritabilities of bristle number approximated those derived from laboratory-raised parents and offspring, but wing length heritability was significantly lower in nature than in the laboratory. Among-population heritabilities, estimated by regressing population means of wild-caught flies against those of their laboratory-reared descendants, were close to 0.5. The genetic differentiation of populations was clinal with latitude, and was accompanied by significant geographic differences in the norms of reaction to temperature. These clines are similar to those reported on other continents and in other Drosophila species, and are almost certainly caused by natural selection. Genetic regressions between the characters reveal that the cline in bristle number may be a correlated response to geographic selection on wing length, but not vice versa. Our results indicate that there is a sizable genetic component to phenotypic variation within and among populations of D. melanogaster in nature.",W1881240473,False,0.5035787224769592

https://doi.org/10.1017/s0016672300001208,Clines in body dimensions in populations of <i>Drosophilia subobscura</i>,"Five dimensions—wing length and width, thorax length, head width and tibia length—have been measured on samples of twelve populations of Drosophila subobscura taken from different parts of the species range, extending from Scotland to Israel. The populations had been started from thirty or more pairs of flies and maintained in the laboratory for eight to eleven generations. They were reared for measurement under standard conditions, so that any differences between them must be of genetic origin. The localities from which the populations came ranged over 25° of latitude and 15° F. in mean annual temperature. The population means of the five dimensions all showed strong positive correlations with latitude and slightly lower negative correlations with mean annual temperature. There is, in consequence, a very uniform cline in the five dimensions, each increasing as we move northwards. This pattern differs from that found for essentially the same dimensions of D. robusta by Stalker &amp; Carson (1947), where all the correlations with latitude are lower and those for head and thorax size are of opposite sign in the two species. A partial correlation analysis and reference to selection experiments suggests that there are two distinct groups of genes involved in these clines: (1) a group of genes causing increase in relative wing and leg size, and responsible for the positive correlation of these dimensions with latitude in both species, and (2) a group of general size genes causing correlated changes in all dimensions, which have been selected in opposite directions in the two species, with the result that head and thorax size increase in subobscura but decrease in robusta as latitude increases. The ratio of wing length to thorax length has a high positive correlation with latitude in both species. Further analysis of the data available on both species brings out the following points: 1. In subobscura there is considerable variation between localities remaining for all dimensions when the correlations with latitude are eliminated. This component of variance is much larger in proportion to the within-locality variance in subobscura than in robusta. 2. Comparison of the percentage regression coefficients of dimensions on latitude or temperature shows that individual dimensions change more rapidly in proportion to both geographical indices in subobscura, but the ratio of wing to thorax length?changes more rapidly in robusta. 3. The ‘environmental’ regression of dimension on temperature of rearing in the laboratory, measured only for robusta, is very much higher than the corresponding genetic regression between populations on mean annual temperature for all the robusta dimensions and different in sign for head and thorax size. But this environ mental regression is uniformly only about twice as high as the corresponding genetic regression for each character in subobscura. Unexpectedly, the environmental and genetic regressions on temperature of the wing/thorax length ratio are equal in robusta. 4. D. subobscura is about 20% smaller in head and thorax size, and 26% less in wing width, than robusta, when both species are reared at 18° C. 5. The basic within-culture variances of the five dimensions are 50–100% greater in subobscura than in robusta for all dimensions. Variability in D. melanogaster is about the same as in D. robusta. Some of the possible implications of these results are discussed.",W1965771696,False,0.3634427785873413

The chapter offers a few generalizations regarding the practical applicability of the individual quota. It aims to identify the circumstances under which use of the individual quota should be avoided or approached with particular caution. The purported advantages of management by individual quota allocation lie in the elimination of important external diseconomies, both among those associated with open-access fisheries and those peculiar to fisheries subject to limited entry licensing.

To determine the physical processes contributing to these changes in the Arctic pack ice, model results from a regional coupled ice–ocean model have been analyzed. Since 1988 the thickness of the simulated basinwide ice thinned by 1.31 m or 43%. The thinning is greatest along the coast in the sector from the Chukchi Sea to the Beaufort Sea to Greenland. It is hypothesized that the thinning since 1988 is due to preconditioning, a trigger, and positive feedbacks: 1) the fall, winter, and spring air temperatures over the Arctic Ocean have gradually increased over the last 50 yr, leading to reduced thickness of first-year ice at the start of summer; 2) a temporary shift, starting in 1989, of two principal climate indexes (the Arctic Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation) caused a flushing of some of the older, thicker ice out of the basin and an increase in the summer open water extent; and 3) the increasing amounts of summer open water allow for increasing absorption of solar radiation, which melts the ice, warms the water, and promotes creation of thinner first-year ice, ice that often entirely melts by the end of the subsequent summer. Internal thermodynamic changes related to the positive ice–albedo feedback, not external forcing, dominate the thinning processes over the last 16 yr. This feedback continues to drive the thinning after the climate indexes return to near-normal conditions in the late 1990s. The late 1980s and early 1990s could be considered a tipping point during which the ice–ocean system began to enter a new era of thinning ice and increasing summer open water because of positive feedbacks. It remains to be seen if this era will persist or if a sustained cooling period can reverse the processes.",W1993979961,False,0.03254661709070206

The exchanges of volume, heat, and freshwater at the Greenland‐Scotland Ridge (GSR) are strongly correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and their positive trend is closely linked to the NAO elevation in recent decades. The model confirms observations of decreasing dense water outflow at the Faroe‐Scotland Passage since the 1950s. However, the simulated dense water outflow shows an increase at Denmark Strait, at the Iceland‐Faroe Ridge, and at the GSR as a whole, owing to an increase in AW inflow that may cause an increase in AW recirculation and deep water production in the GIN Sea. The increase of the ISR heat inflow since 1965 contributes to continued thinning of the arctic sea ice since 1966. The influence of the heat inflow on arctic sea ice lags 2–3 years, which suppresses ice production even when the NAO temporarily shifts to a negative mode. Because of this delay, the decline of arctic sea ice is likely to continue if the inflow continues to increase and if the NAO does not shift to a sustained negative mode.",W1496524607,False,0.2908417880535126

Under these conditions, younger, thinner ice anomalies recirculate back to the Alaskan coast more quickly, decreasing the time that new ice has to ridge and thicken before returning for another melt season. During the 2002 and 2003 summers this anomalously younger, thinner ice was advected into Alaskan coastal waters where extensive melting was observed, even though temperatures were locally colder than normal.

The model is used to address Arctic numerical modeling with and without climate restoring. The model without climate restoring reproduces basic observed features of the Arctic ice–ocean circulation. The simulated oceanic processes adjust to the surface and lateral fluxes and transport heat and mass in a way that achieves a rough salt and heat balance in the Arctic in the integration period of seven decades. The main deficiency of the model is its prediction of unrealistically high salinity in the central Arctic, which tends to weaken the ocean currents. The introduction of corrective salinity and temperature restoring terms has a significant impact on prediction of the ice–ocean circulation in the Arctic. The impact results from a chain reaction. First, the restoring terms change the salinity and thermal states in the oceanic mixed layer and below. The altered density structure, in turn, influences the ocean circulation by altering the ocean's dynamic and thermodynamic processes. The ocean circulation then affects ice motion and ice thickness by altering the dynamics and thermodynamics of the ice. Restoring only ocean salinity induces a heat surplus or deficit, which causes the oceanic thermal state to drift away from the climatology. This is also the case with restoring both salinity and temperature in the upper ocean. Only restoring salinity and temperature in the deeper ocean is likely to avoid climate drift in the Arctic. This paper points out the problems of using models without climate restoring and the consequences of using models with climate restoring for Arctic ice–ocean modeling. It stresses the need to use a realistic representation of surface fluxes in order to improve prognostic simulations. It also stresses the importance of oceanic processes such as convective overturning and vertical advection both in the Arctic and in the adjacent oceans. If these processes are not reasonably represented, the models can predict overwarm intermediate layers in the Arctic and an excessive heat influx at Fram Strait, causing the Arctic ice pack to possibly shrink gradually, a scenario global climate models should avoid.",W1984603686,False,0.007462585810571909

To answer this question, I focus on gmax, the multivariate direction of greatest additive genetic variance within populations.

This bias toward the direction of evolution tends to decay with time. Rate of morphological divergence between species is inversely proportional to θ, the angle between the direction of divergence and the direction of greatest genetic variation. The direction of greatest phenotypic variance is not identical with gmax, but for these data is nearly as successful at predicting the direction of species divergence. I interpret the findings to mean that genetic variances and covariances constrain adaptive change in quantitative traits for reasonably long spans of time. An alternative hypothesis, however, cannot be ruled out: that morphological differentiation is biased in the direction gmax because divergence and gmax are both shaped by the same natural selection pressures.

The distribution of the assignment criterion (genetic distance or genotype likelihood) for individuals of a given population was used to define the probability that an individual belongs to the population. Using this definition, it becomes possible to exclude a population as the origin of an individual, a useful extension of the currently available assignment methods. Using simulated data based on the coalescent process, the different methods were evaluated, varying the time of divergence of populations, the mutation model, the sample size, and the number of loci. Likelihood-based methods (especially the Bayesian method) always performed better than distance methods. Other things being equal, genetic markers were always more efficient when evolving under the infinite allele model than under the stepwise mutation model, even for equal values of the differentiation parameter Fst.

At the other extreme, no statistic was able to resolve the close sister relationship of polar bears and brown bears from more distantly related pairs of species. This failure is most likely due to constraints on allele distributions at microsatellite loci. At intermediate scales, both within continuous distributions and in comparisons to insular populations of late Pleistocene origin, it was not possible to define the point where linearity was lost for each of the statistics, except that it is clearly lost after relatively short periods of independent evolution.

We present theoretical arguments indicating that the usefulness of microsatellite data for these purposes may be limited to a short time perspective and to relatively small populations. The evolution of selectively neutral markers is governed by the interaction of mutation and random genetic drift. Mutation pressure has the inherent tendency to shift different populations to the same distribution of alleles. Hence, mutation pressure is a homogenizing force, and population divergence is caused by random genetic drift. In case of allozymes or sequence data, the diversifying effect of drift is typically orders of magnitude larger than the homogenizing effect of mutation pressure. By a simple model, we demonstrate that the situation may be different for microsatellites where mutation rates are high and the range of alleles is limited. With the help of computer simulations, we investigate to what extent genetic distance measures applied to microsatellite data can nevertheless yield useful estimators for phylogenetic relationships or demographic parameters. We show that predictions based on microsatellite data are quite reliable in small populations, but that already in moderately sized populations the danger of misinterpretation is substantial.",W1827209629,False,0.23963071405887604

We then use computer simulations to evaluate the overall reliability of this distance and to compare it with allele sharing and Nei's distance.

Here we find a linear relationship between genetic and geographic distance in a worldwide sample of human populations, with major deviations from the fitted line explicable by admixture or extreme isolation. A close relationship is shown to exist between the correlation of geographic distance and genetic differentiation (as measured by F ST ) and the geographic pattern of heterozygosity across populations. Considering a worldwide set of geographic locations as possible sources of the human expansion, we find that heterozygosities in the globally distributed populations of the data set are best explained by an expansion originating in Africa and that no geographic origin outside of Africa accounts as well for the observed patterns of genetic diversity. Although the relationship between F ST and geographic distance has been interpreted in the past as the result of an equilibrium model of drift and dispersal, simulation shows that the geographic pattern of heterozygosities in this data set is consistent with a model of a serial founder effect starting at a single origin. Given this serial-founder scenario, the relationship between genetic and geographic distance allows us to derive bounds for the effects of drift and natural selection on human genetic variation.",W1997722194,False,0.2521204650402069

Variation is often summarised in terms of one or a few statistics (eg FST and gene diversity). Now that multilocus genotypes for hundreds of autosomal loci are available for thousands of individuals, new approaches are applicable. Recently, trees of individuals and other clustering approaches have demonstrated the power of an individual-focused analysis. We propose analysing the distributions of genetic distances between individuals. Each distribution, or common ancestry profile (CAP), is unique to an individual, and does not require a priori assignment of individuals to populations. Here, we consider a range of models of population history and, using coalescent simulation, reveal the potential insights gained from a set of CAPs. Information lies in the shapes of individual profiles -- sometimes captured by variance of individual CAPs -- and the variation across profiles. Analysis of short tandem repeat genotype data for over 1,000 individuals from 52 populations is consistent with dramatic differences in population histories across human groups.",W1515448091,False,0.0031928792595863342

The past five years have witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of completely sequenced plastid genomes, fuelled largely by advances in conventional Sanger sequencing technology. Here we report a further significant reduction in time and cost for plastid genome sequencing through the successful use of a newly available pyrosequencing platform, the Genome Sequencer 20 (GS 20) System (454 Life Sciences Corporation), to rapidly and accurately sequence the whole plastid genomes of the basal eudicot angiosperms Nandina domestica (Berberidaceae) and Platanus occidentalis (Platanaceae). More than 99.75% of each plastid genome was simultaneously obtained during two GS 20 sequence runs, to an average depth of coverage of 24.6× in Nandina and 17.3× in Platanus. The Nandina and Platanus plastid genomes shared essentially identical gene complements and possessed the typical angiosperm plastid structure and gene arrangement. To assess the accuracy of the GS 20 sequence, over 45 kilobases of sequence were generated for each genome using conventional sequencing. Overall error rates of 0.043% and 0.031% were observed in GS 20 sequence for Nandina and Platanus, respectively. More than 97% of all observed errors were associated with homopolymer runs, with ~60% of all errors associated with homopolymer runs of 5 or more nucleotides and ~50% of all errors associated with regions of extensive homopolymer runs. No substitution errors were present in either genome. Error rates were generally higher in the single-copy and noncoding regions of both plastid genomes relative to the inverted repeat and coding regions. Highly accurate and essentially complete sequence information was obtained for the Nandina and Platanus plastid genomes using the GS 20 System. More importantly, the high accuracy observed in the GS 20 plastid genome sequence was generated for a significant reduction in time and cost over traditional shotgun-based genome sequencing techniques, although with approximately half the coverage of previously reported GS 20 de novo genome sequence. The GS 20 should be broadly applicable to angiosperm plastid genome sequencing, and therefore promises to expand the scale of plant genetic and phylogenetic research dramatically.",W1747464137,False,0.018501263111829758

The concept has been intimately tied to entomology since the 1860s, when Benjamin Walsh proposed that many host-specific phytophagous insects originate by shifting and adapting to new host plant species. If true, sympatric speciation would have tremendous implications for our understanding of species and their origins, biodiversity (25–40% of all animals are thought to be phytophagous specialists), insect-plant coevolution, community ecology, phylogenetics, and systematics, as well as practical significance for the management of insect pests. During much of the twentieth century sympatric speciation was viewed as much less plausible than geographic (allopatric) speciation. However, empirical field studies, laboratory experiments, developments in population genetics theory, and phylogenetic and biogeographic data have all recently combined to shed a more favorable light on the process. We review the evidence for sympatric speciation via host shifting for phytophagous insects and propose a set of testable predictions for distinguishing geographic mode (allopatric versus sympatric) of divergence. Our conclusion is that sympatric speciation is a viable hypothesis. We highlight areas where more thorough testing is needed to move sympatric speciation into the realm of accepted scientific theory.",W1891857422,False,0.47632506489753723

Exact calculations for the deterministic case show that an allele that is favorable when rare is delayed very little even by a strong barrier: its spread is slowed by a time proportional to log((B/σ)√2S)/S, where B is the barrier strength, σ the dispersal range, and fitnesses are 1:1 + S:1 + 2S. However,when there is selection against heterozygotes, such that the allele cannot increase from low frequency, a barrier can cause a much greater delay. If gene flow is reduced below a critical value, spread is entirely prevented. Stochastic simulations show that with additive selection, random drift slows down the spread of the allele, below the deterministic speed of σ√2S. The delay to the advance of an advantageous allele caused by a strong barrier can be substantially increased by random drift and increases with B/(2Sρσ2) in a one-dimensional habitat of density ρ. However, with selection against heterozygotes, drift can facilitate the spread and can free an allele that would otherwise be trapped indefinitely by a strong barrier. We discuss the implications of these results for the evolution of chromosome rearrangements.",W1924385332,False,0.30336830019950867

https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/133.3.649,Recombination suppression by heterozygous Robertsonian chromosomes in the mouse.,"Abstract Robertsonian chromosomes are metacentric chromosomes formed by the joining of two telocentric chromosomes at their centromere ends. Many Robertsonian chromosomes of the mouse suppress genetic recombination near the centromere when heterozygous. We have analyzed genetic recombination and meiotic pairing in mice heterozygous for Robertsonian chromosomes and genetic markers to determine (1) the reason for this recombination suppression and (2) whether there are any consistent rules to predict which Robertsonian chromosomes will suppress recombination. Meiotic pairing was analyzed using synaptonemal complex preparations. Our data provide evidence that the underlying mechanism of recombination suppression is mechanical interference in meiotic pairing between Robertsonian chromosomes and their telocentric partners. The fact that recombination suppression is specific to individual Robertsonian chromosomes suggests that the pairing delay is caused by minor structural differences between the Robertsonian chromosomes and their telocentric homologs and that these differences arise during Robertsonian formation. Further understanding of this pairing delay is important for mouse mapping studies. In 10 mouse chromosomes (3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15 and 19) the distances from the centromeres to first markers may still be underestimated because they have been determined using only Robertsonian chromosomes.

Advantageous, neutral and deleterious alleles are considered, and certain aspects of the patterns generated by new alleles that are ultimately fixed and ultimately lost are examined. To characterize the spatial pattern of rare alleles, the distribution, Pi, the probability that the new allele is found in exactly i local populations before it is lost, is defined and estimated from the simulations. The shape of the Pi distribution is surprisingly similar for selected and neutral alleles. For advantageous alleles going to fixation, the ""wave of advance"" is set up quickly, but stochastic effects reduce the wave speed from Fisher's (1937) value. Gene flow is much more effective in dispersing alleles in a two-dimensional array than in one dimension. Long distance gene flow has a much smaller effect in two dimensions than in one dimension.",W1894569600,False,0.05375368148088455

Reliable prediction of grazing responses from species’ traits would be a major step forward in generalizing knowledge and management beyond the locality. Recently results have been presented showing that plant species’ responses to grazing in subhumid grasslands in Argentina and Israel could be predicted from simple traits: height, leaf size, life history and specific leaf area (SLA). This study assessed whether those relationships between traits and grazing responses hold for Australian semi‐arid and arid shrublands and woodlands. Eleven lists of grazing responses from five published grazing studies were matched with a plant trait data set. Trait distributions were compared between response groups pooled across studies. Relationships between traits and grazing response were also assessed, both within and across studies, using meta‐analysis. Overall there was little evidence for predictability of grazing responses with simple traits in the semi‐arid and arid shrublands and woodlands. There were relationships between grazing response and life history and growth form, and some weak evidence for grazing increasers having high SLA. Synthesis and applications. It was concluded that prediction of grazing responses with simple traits is less clear in semi‐arid and arid rangelands, which are characterized by openness at ground level and high diversity of growth forms, compared with subhumid grasslands that have structurally simple, continuous swards. The finding that species’ traits may have differing predictive capacity for grazing responses in different situations means that we need more empirical studies in different situations. The most important contrasts between situations for investigation are likely to be on axes of rainfall/productivity and evolutionary history of grazing.",W1554281692,False,0.8778705596923828
https://doi.org/10.2307/1542710,Overgrowth competition between clades: implications for interpretation of the fossil record and overgrowth indices,"Overgrowth interactions (2693 in total) were observed among three major groups (arguably clades) of bryozoans--cheilostomatids (57 species), ctenostomatids (3 species), and cyclostomatids (14 species). The bryozoans studied here occur in shallow water at high-temperate polar latitudes where they encrust hard substrata such as rock piles. The main study site was the intertidal and infralittoral zones of Kodiak Island, Alaska, but observations were also made in similar zones of South Georgia Island and the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean. Cheilostomatids dominated the number of species, individuals, and interactions at all depths. Intraclade interactions formed 73.7% of the encounters for cheilostomatids, 1.6% for ctenostomatids, and 5.7% for cyclostomatids. The competitive ranking of the three clades was broadly ctenostomatids > cyclostomatids > cheilostomatids. Significantly, these results contradict all previous quantitative studies of bryozoan overgrowth, in which cheilostomatids are reported to overgrow cyclostomatids at a higher rate. From these studies and the literature, we calculated win indices to vary from 0 to 0.42 for living cyclostomatids, from 0.08 to 0.9 for living cheilostomatids, and from 0.25 to 0.75 for living ctenostomatids. The win indices of cyclostomatid and cheilostomatid clades show significantly more variation in living assemblages than in fossil assemblages. This disparity may be due to differential preservation (polar and subpolar assemblages last less than 4 years). The diversity was very high in terms of both species richness and interaction types (outcomes between competitor pairs). Comparison with the literature suggests the possibility that nearshore diversity of bryozoans may be bimodal (have two peaks) between high arctic and antarctic latitudes. Indices of success in overgrowth competition have been constructed in various ways. For cheilostomatids, the method of calculation had little influence on the ranking of representatives. In contrast, the apparent success of ctenostomatids and cyclostomatids varied hugely with how the index was calculated. This inconsistency is due to the use of very different strategies in overgrowth competition; among the two latter groups, many interactions involve tied outcomes.",W1940066137,False,0.8230544924736023

These hardgrounds were formed in extensively burrowed carbonate sediments and their hummocky surface topographies were inherited, in part, from a pre-existing pattern of burrow tunnels. A diverse community, including bryozoans, brachiopods, crinoids, edrioasteroids, and paracrinoids, colonized these hard substrates. In addition, most surfaces are riddled with small, cylindrical boreholes ( Trypanites ) which represent dwellings of soft-bodied organisms. Some hardground surfaces were inhabited by multiple generations of organisms. Remains of the older generations of encrusters were strongly abraded and nearly obliterated. Superimposed upon these worn remnants are well-preserved remains of rather fragile organisms, e.g. complete hybocystitid crinoids and edrioasteroids. Evidently, certain hardground surfaces were rapidly buried by muds, resulting in the in situ preservation of the last generation of attached organisms. Slightly differing subcommunities of organisms inhabited various microhabitats provided by the irregular hardground surfaces. Thus, the relative abundance of bryozoans and echinoderms encrusting the roofs of small crevices differs from that on the exposed upper surfaces of the hardgrounds. This is the geologically oldest known hardground community in which microhabitat subdivision can be recognized. However, polarity between the subcommunities is not as pronounced as in geologically younger hard substrate faunas.",W1756183235,False,0.8957463502883911

https://doi.org/10.1201/9781420065756.ch5,The Ecological And Evolutionary Importance Of Maternal Effects In The Sea,"Maternal effects are non-genetic effects of the maternal phenotype or environment on the phenotype of offspring. Whilst maternal effects are now recognised as fundamentally important in terrestrial systems, they have received less recognition in the marine environment despite being remarkably common. The authors review the maternal effect literature and provide a simple framework for understanding maternal effects that increase offspring fitness (termed anticipatory maternal effects) and maternal effects that increase maternal fitness at the expense of offspring fitness (termed selfish maternal effects). The review then addresses various well-studied (offspring size effects, maternal care, oviposition effects) and poorly studied (manipulating offspring dispersal potential, toxicant resistance, sibling competition, mate choice) examples of maternal effects in the marine environment with a focus on marine invertebrates and fish. Offspring size effects are strong and pervasive in the marine environment but the sources and underlying causes of offspring size variation remain poorly understood. More generally, the authors suspect that changes in offspring phenotype are often adaptive maternal effects in response to environmental change.

In the majority of such examples, predators are the selecting agent while examples involving parasites are much less common. Aphids produce a winged dispersal morph under adverse conditions, such as crowding or poor plant quality. It has recently been demonstrated that pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum, also produce winged offspring when exposed to predatory ladybirds, the first example of an enemy‐induced morphological change facilitating dispersal. We examined the response of A. pisum to another important natural enemy, the parasitoid Aphidius ervi, in two sets of experiments. In the first set of experiments, two aphid clones both produced the highest proportion of winged offspring when exposed as colonies on plants to parasitoid females. In all cases, aphids exposed to male parasitoids produced a higher mean proportion of winged offspring than controls, but not significantly so. Aphid disturbance by parasitoids was greatest in female treatments, much less in male treatments and least in controls, tending to match the pattern of winged offspring production. In a second set of experiments, directly parasitised aphids produced no greater proportion of winged offspring than unparasitised controls, thus being parasitised itself is not used by aphids for induction of the winged morph. The induction of wing development by parasitoids shows that host defences against parasites may also include an increased rate of dispersal away from infected habitats. While previous work has shown that parasitism suppresses wing development in parasitised individuals, our experiments are the first to demonstrate a more indirect influence of parasites on insect polyphenism. Because predators and parasites differ fundamentally in a variety of attributes, our finding suggests that the wing production in response to natural enemies is of general occurrence in A. pisum and, perhaps, in other aphids.",W1978674728,False,0.8696911931037903

Apparent competition is an indirect interaction among prey species mediated by a shared predator, and has been increasingly linked to declines of prey species across taxa. We review theoretical and empirical studies of apparent competition, with specific attention to the mechanisms of asymmetry among apparently competing prey species. Asymmetry is theoretically driven by niche overlap, species fitness traits, spatial heterogeneity and generalist predator behavior. In real‐world systems, human‐induced changes to ecosystems such as habitat alteration and introduced species may be ultimate sources of species endangerment. However, apparent competition is shown to be a proximate mechanism when resultant changes introduce or subsidize abundant primary prey for predator populations. Demonstration of apparent competition is difficult due to the indirect relationships between prey and predator species and the potential for concurrent exploitative competition or other community effects. However, general conclusions are drawn concerning the characteristics of prey and predator species likely to exhibit asymmetric apparent competition, and the options for recovering endangered species. While short‐term management may be required to avoid imminent extinction in systems demonstrating apparent competition, we propose adaptive conservation efforts directed at long‐term recovery.",W1563702561,False,0.8761112093925476

The method was used to develop spatial models of daily minimum and maximum temperature and daily precipitation for all of Canada, at a spatial resolution of 300 arc s of latitude and longitude, for the period 1961–2003. Each daily model was optimized automatically by minimizing the generalized cross validation. The fitted trivariate splines incorporated a spatially varying dependence on ground elevation and were able to adapt automatically to the large variation in station density over Canada. Extensive quality control measures were performed on the source data. Error estimates for the fitted surfaces based on withheld data across southern Canada were comparable to, or smaller than, errors obtained by daily interpolation studies elsewhere with denser data networks. Mean absolute errors in daily maximum and minimum temperature averaged over all years were 1.1° and 1.6°C, respectively. Daily temperature extremes were also well matched. Daily precipitation is challenging because of short correlation length scales, the preponderance of zeros, and significant error associated with measurement of snow. A two-stage approach was adopted in which precipitation occurrence was estimated and then used in conjunction with a surface of positive precipitation values. Daily precipitation occurrence was correctly predicted 83% of the time. Withheld errors in daily precipitation were small, with mean absolute errors of 2.9 mm, although these were relatively large in percentage terms. However, mean percent absolute errors in seasonal and annual precipitation totals were 14% and 9%, respectively, and seasonal precipitation upper 95th percentiles were attenuated on average by 8%. Precipitation and daily maximum temperatures were most accurately interpolated in the autumn, consistent with the large well-organized synoptic systems that prevail in this season. Daily minimum temperatures were most accurately interpolated in summer. The withheld data tests indicate that the models can be used with confidence across southern Canada in applications that depend on daily temperature and accumulated seasonal and annual precipitation. They should be used with care in applications that depend critically on daily precipitation extremes.",W1970969255,False,0.07925207167863846

,Aspen elk and fire in the Rocky Mountain national parks of North America,"Trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) forests in the Rocky Mountains are an indicator of ecological conditions because they have maintained their presence for thousands of years through vegetative reproduction, and these communities have high biodiversity. Aspen can be tied to ecosystem condition through a 4-level trophic model that links humans, wolves (Canis lupus), elk (Cervus elaphus), and aspen through the processes of predationf herbivory, burning! and differential wildlife responses to humans. We used a compara- tive study of research literature and historic photographs to evaluate aspen change over time in 6 Rocky Mountain national parks in Canada and the United States: Jasper, Banff, Yoho, Kootenay, Yellowstone, and Rocky Mountain. Across all parks, aspen has consis- tent responses to increased browsing by ungulates and decreased frequency of fire. Al- though aspen was historically vigorous in all parks, today most stands are in decline. Trees are intermediate to mature in age (60-120 years old), and elk browse off new suck- ers before they reach 2 m in height. Fire, combined with browsing, has hindered regen- eration of aspen. The exception to this pattern is northern Jasper National Park where elk densities appear to have been reduced by wolves in the 1970s, and aspen regenerated. We found a gradient of increasing human-caused ecosystem changes in Rocky Mountain national parks: (1 ) historic conditions with frequent fires and low elk density regulated by humans, wolves, and other predators (i.e., all parks); (2) current conditions of patches of high elk density, where wolves are displaced by human land use, within a matrix of mod- erate elk density, where wolves and other predators are present (i.e., Banff and Jasper na- tional parks); (3) recent condltions inside parks, where wolves are absent, and very high elk density is regulated by competition for food (i.e., Yellowstone before 1995); and (4) potential future conditions, where increasing human land use around parks displaces car- nivores and reduces hunting, and very high elk density occurs throughout landscapes. As- pen stands regenerate well in areas of low elk density and in some areas of moderate elk density; however, in areas of high and very high elk density, aspen does not regenerate to heights >2 m, and burning accelerates clone deterioration. Our recommendations to na- tional park managers are to restore carnivores, use fire in areas of low elk density, and control human uses that displace carnivores.",W1590942030,False,0.8078346252441406

However, major questions regarding its population-level impact remain empirically unanswered: (a) How does intraspecific genetic diversity affect the ecological characteristics of sexual species, in which recombination can alter the outcome of causal mechanisms such as selection and niche diversification? (b) Does genetic diversity increase population dynamic stability? (c) Is the impact of genetic diversity dependent on the selective environment? To answer these questions, I founded replicate flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) populations with different degrees of ecologically relevant, heritable trait variation and monitored their dynamics for approximately eight generations. I show that population stability and persistence increased with greater genetic variation but that the stabilizing effect was independent of the selective habitat (different proportions of ancestral and novel resources). Alleles from a single founding strain underwent a selective sweep in the homogeneous ancestral habitat but not in a novel heterogeneous habitat. These results expand current understanding of the ecological impacts of genetic diversity by showing that genetically more diverse sexual populations persist longer and are more stable but that the selective environment determines the mechanistic basis of increased stability.",W1967559586,False,0.6781657338142395

In comparison with habitat loss, over-harvesting, and pollution, the threat posed by disease may appear to represent a minor problem for conservation. Habitat loss and fragmentation are the driving forces most frequently indicted in the loss of biodiversity (e.g. Saunders and Hobbs 1991). However, disease risks for animals living in the remaining habitat fragments are likely to increase as contact with human and domestic animal populations becomes more frequent, and with alterations in microclimate and landscape ecology (Scott 1988; Saunders and Hobbs 1991; Forman 1995). Here we outline the circumstances under which infectious diseases represent a conservation problem, and draw attention to the insights that are needed to permit informed decisions about future management strategies.",W1515271474,False,0.03552517667412758

The performance of these tests is evaluated analytically and by simulation and the method is applied to a data set on the locations of cases of childhood leukaemia and lymphoma in a defined geographical area. In particular the impact on power of the choice of k and of the ratio of cases to controls is examined.

In its functional response a predator sea shore snail caused a decreasing percentage mortality as prey (barnacle) density increased (type 2 response). This causes instability in prey numbers. However, when account was taken of the developmental response in a hypothetical pseudosnail, the prey mortality caused over a year by a single—predator as a function of prey density, was different from that expected on the basis of the functional response alone.

Consideration has been given to the manner in which parasites select hosts for oviposition and to the physiological and psychological basis of this selection. The distribution of parasite progeny among suitable hosts has been analysed in many cases, for the fewer the hostS that are superparasitized for any given number of parasite eggs laid the greater the efficiency of the parasite in reducing host density. It is obvious that before the factors of host selection and superparasitism become important in host-parasite interaction the parasite must find the host individuals. When the hosts are confined to a relatively small area the potential oviposition of the parasite, subject to discrimination among hosts and restraint in oviposition, often determines the level of parasitism. As distance between individuals of the host population becomes greater, however, it is necessary for the parasite to search the environment more extensively. Therefore, the ability of the parasite to find hosts is a factor of prime importance in determining its influence on the density of its host. The success with which a parasite discovers hosts in relation to host density is determined, of course, by several characteristics of the parasite species and by the modification of these characteristics through variations in the physical environment.",W2108289478,False,0.7371081709861755

If certain simple criteria are satisfied approximately on an appropriate scale of measurement, nEcan be estimated by comparing the phenotypic means and variances in the two parental populations and in their F1 and F2 hybrids (and backcrosses). This generalizes the method of WRIGHtTo genetically heterogeneous (or wild) parental populations, as well as inbred lines. Standard errors of the estimates are derived for large samples. The minimum number of genes involved in producing a large difference between populations in a quantitative trait is typically estimated to be about 5 or IO, with occasional values up to 20. This strongly supports the neo-Darwinian theory that large evolutionary changes usually occur by the accumulation of multiple genetic factors with relatively small effects.",W1891728252,False,0.22925227880477905

I tested 10 hypotheses, each suggesting a different social, ecological, or ontogenetic factor as a proximal cause of natal dispersal in this species. Using discriminant analysis I also examined effects on dispersal of several independent variables concurrently. Data from marking and live—trapping studies over three field seasons (1979—1981) failed to support hypotheses suggesting resource shortage, ectoparasite load, social facilitation, conspecific aggression, or avoidance by conspecifics as proximal causes of natal dispersal in S. beldingi. Furthermore, dispersal is apparently not caused by changes in juveniles' response thresholds to conspecific aggression or by juveniles' attempts to avoid members of their family units, nearest neighbors, or other members of their local populations. My data supported an ""ontogenetic switch"" hypothesis that suggests natal dispersal by male S. beldingi is triggered by attainment of a particular body mass or body composition, or some combination of these two variables. Other data indicated that this ontogenetic switch initiates not only dispersal behavior per se, but also a larger syndrome o behaviors that appear to be functionally related to dispersal. Specifically, this syndrome involves changes in exploration, responses to frightening stimuli, and locomotor behavior exhibited by dispersers. I discuss possible relationships among variables operating at different proximal levels (sensu Tinbergen) to cause natal dispersal in S. beldingi and other mammals. I conclude that a complex suite of variables probably operates at genetic, physiological, and socioecological levels to proximally cause natal dispersal in each species. The ultimate (evolutionary) hypotheses most consistent with my data from S. beldingi are that dispersal: (1) reduces nuclear family incest, (2) optimizes inbreeding, and (3) improves access to mates.",W1968274110,False,0.7613951563835144
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2000-5958,Genetic Diversity and the Survival of Populations,"Abstract: In this comprehensive review, a range of factors is considered that may influence the significance of genetic diversity for the survival of a population. Genetic variation is essential for the adaptability of a population in which quantitatively inherited, fitness‐related traits are crucial. Therefore, the relationship between genetic diversity and fitness should be studied in order to make predictions on the importance of genetic diversity for a specific population. The level of genetic diversity found in a population highly depends on the mating system, the evolutionary history of a species and the population history (the latter is usually unknown), and on the level of environmental heterogeneity. An accurate estimation of fitness remains complex, despite the availability of a range of direct and indirect fitness parameters. There is no general relationship between genetic diversity and various fitness components. However, if a lower level of heterozygosity represents an increased level of inbreeding, a reduction in fitness can be expected. Molecular markers can be used to study adaptability or fitness, provided that they represent a quantitative trait locus (QTL) or are themselves functional genes involved in these processes. Next to a genetic response of a population to environmental change, phenotypic plasticity in a genotype can affect fitness. The relative importance of plasticity to genetic diversity depends on the species and population under study and on the environmental conditions. The possibilities for application of current knowledge on genetic diversity and population survival for the management of natural populations are discussed.",W1970411761,False,0.44003793597221375

There are three captive putative Mexican wolf lineages: Certified, Ghost Ranch, and Aragón lineages. From pedigree analysis, the Certified lineage has the lowest level of inbreeding and has retained the most founder alleles. In contrast, the Ghost Ranch has a high level of inbreeding and fewest founder alleles. From molecular genetics data, particularly from microsatellite loci, it appears that all of the lineages consist of Mexican wolves, and none of them appear to have ancestry from dogs or coyotes. Further, the molecular data are consistent with the Certified lineage having three founders instead of the four previously assumed. From these findings, we recommend that the three lineages be combined to increase the number of founders and to postpone any inbreeding depression. The combination of pedigree analysis and molecular genetic data allowed us to resolve several long-standing concerns in Mexican wolves.

We classified 822 UK vascular plants on the basis of their occurrence along an urban–rural gradient in 26 710 samples of vegetation from 2508 UK 1‐km grid squares, including a wide range of rural habitats and Sheffield and Birmingham, two of the UK's largest cities. Both alien and native species were classified with respect to mean proportion of urban land cover in the 1‐km grid squares in which the species occurs ( urbanity ), and absolute frequency in highly urban grid squares ( urban frequency ). Bayesian regression models were then developed for both measures, with a wide range of plant traits as explanatory variables. Results for aliens and natives and for both urban measures were remarkably similar: the single, coherent picture of ‘successful urban species’ that emerges from our analysis is of robust plants of relatively fertile, dry, unshaded, base‐rich habitats. Only seed mass behaved very differently for natives and aliens; seed mass was related positively to success of urban natives, and negatively to success of urban aliens. Neither clonality, seed dispersal nor seed persistence in the soil were strongly linked to success in urban habitats. Synthesis. Cities can provide opportunities for surprisingly rich floras, but the traits of species that can persist in cities are quite narrowly circumscribed. More generally, it is clear that analysis of traits reveals important patterns in floristic data that would be far from obvious from a purely floristic analysis.",W1591007160,False,0.657241702079773

,Invasive plant problems and requirements for weed risk assessment in the Galapagos islands.,"Galapagos is a young oceanic archipelago with a native vascular flora of 560 species, few native trees, and an absence of many families present on the neighbouring mainland. It has only recently become subject to human influence. Plants introduced by man have only become problematic in the last 150 years, with most weed problems being less than 50 years old. The rise in plant introductions parallels the human population increase, with a recent introduction rate of 10 plant species per year, 100,000 times the natural colonization rate. Invasive plants include weeds and cultivated species, which cause detrimental effects on agriculture as well as natural habitats. Introduced species are the principal threat to the Galapagos ecosystem, and several species of alien plant are seriously damaging native habitats and threatening endemic species. Examples of some of the worst invaders and of the process and effects of invasions are presented. A weed risk assessment system for Galapagos must take account of the particular requirements of a fragile oceanic island ecosystem and flora. It must include consideration of potential invaders as well as plants already introduced. Factors that need to be included in an objective risk assessment system for Galapagos are discussed in light of the New Zealand Department of Conservation’s model. THE GALAPAGOS AND THEIR FLORA Galapagos is an isolated oceanic archipelago of volcanic islands lying 1000 km west of Ecuador, straddling the equator. They have never been connected to the mainland and range in age from 1 to 3.3 million years (Simkin 1984). Although it has been suggested that there were earlier visits to the islands by indigenous people from mainland South America, the official date of discovery of the archipelago is recognized as 1535 (Slevin 1959; Hickman 1985). In that year, Tomas de Berlanga’s ship was carried there by currents, while becalmed on his way from Panama to Peru (Slevin 1959; Hickman 1985). The islands were uninhabited at that time, and no evidence of earlier human use has been found. The first visitors after discovery were mainly buccaneers, passing sailors, whalers and sealers (Hickman 1985; Gordillo 1990). The first settler established on Floreana about 1807 and other groups there, after short intervals of unoccupancy, in 1832 and 1902; it has been permanently inhabited since 1929. San Cristobal was settled permanently in 1869, Isabela in 1893 and Santa Cruz in the 1920s (Slevin 1959; Schofield 1989). The pirates and whalers deliberately or accidentally introduced a number of alien species, including goats, rats and, probably, insects and plants. Even before permanent settlement, Floreana contained large areas dominated by introduced plants such as Citrus spp. (Slevin 1959; Hamann 1984). The rapidly increasing settled population, growing at 8% per year in the 1990s through immigration and indigenous birthrate, has been accompanied by an enormous number of new introductions of alien plants and animals (Mauchamp 1997). Although agricultural development began at the time of settlement, the process has been uneven, leading to different rates of introduction of alien species. Floreana has the longest history of the presence of a large introduced flora, while agriculture on Santa Cruz was minimal until about 1960 (Moll 1990). The archipelago, although straddling the equator, has a semi-arid, subtropical climate, due to the prevailing Humboldt current from the Antarctic and prevailing winds which also come from the south for most of the year. These factors lead to a vegetation which forms certain well-defined zones according to altitude and aspect (Wiggins and Porter 1971). Progressing from lowlands to highlands, these zones are most commonly defined as: Littoral, comprising mangroves, dune vegetation and other coastal communities; “Arid” (actually semi-arid), comprising scrub and light woodland dominated by cacti; Transition, comprising more or less closed woodland; and Humid, which is broken into a number of sub-zones that vary between islands, but which include Scalesia Zone forest, Miconia zone dense scrub, and Fern-sedge zone highlands. The more humid zones extend lower on the southern, wetter sides of islands, and most islands, which are low, have no Humid Zone. Biodiversity is therefore highest on the larger, more climatically diverse islands. Plant endemicity is highest in the Arid Zone, which is represented on all except the smallest islets. The Galapagos islands support a native vascular flora of about 560 species, of which about 32% are endemic (Lawesson et al. 1987). This includes some of uncertain origin, principally pantropical weeds, which may have arrived naturally or may have been introduced by the earliest human visitors to the islands. Galapagos is a typical oceanic archipelago in that the native flora, like the fauna, is impoverished in the sense that a given area counts many fewer species than would a similar area in the mainland source areas (Loope and Mueller-Dombois 1989; Moll 1990). As a consequence, interspecific competition has also been weaker, and these two factors combine to render the vegetation highly susceptible to invasion by more competitive species (see Simberloff 1995 for review of this point). The relative impoverishment applies unevenly; for example, there are no tree species in some of the highland zones, although the climate and soils are suitable for tree growth. These zones are therefore especially susceptible to invasion by tree and shrub species that overtop and shade out the low-growing native vegetation.

https://doi.org/10.2307/3237168,On the variation explained by ordination and constrained ordination axes,"Abstract. Total inertia (TI), the sum of eigenvalues for all ordination axes, is often used as a measure of total variation in a data set. By use of simulated data sets, I demonstrate that lack‐of‐fit of data to the response model implicit in any eigenvector ordination method results in polynomial distortion ordination axes, with eigenvalues that normally contribute 30–70% to TI (depending on data set properties). The amount of compositional variation extracted on ecologically interpretable ordination axes (structure axes) is thus underestimated by the eigenvalue‐to‐total‐inertia ratio. I recommend that the current use of total inertia as a measure of compositional variation is discontinued. Eigenvalues of structure axes can, however, be used with some caution to indicate their relative importance. I also demonstrate that when the total inertia is partitioned on different sets of explanatory variables and unexplained variation by use of (partial) constrained ordination, (35) 50–85% of the variation ‘unexplained’ by the supplied explanatory variables represents lack‐of‐fit of data to model. Thus, the common interpretation of ‘unexplained variation’ as random variation (‘noise’) or coenoclinal variation caused by unmeasured explanatory variables, is generally inappropriate. I recommend a change of focus from the variation‐explained‐to‐total inertia ratio and ‘unexplained’ variation to relative amounts of variation explained by different sets of explanatory variables.",W1969435238,False,0.7799692749977112
https://doi.org/10.1071/bt9570103,"Dark Island heath (Ninety-mile Plain, South Australia). III. The root systems","This paper describes the nature of the root systems of the most important members of the heath community. Several variations of tap-root and fibrous root systems were observed. Tap-rooted species were either shallow rooting (1–2 ft) or deep rooting (6 or more feet into the clay subsoil). Two variations of deep tap-rooted species were observed. The tap-root of one decays with age; the laterals of the other produce frequent sucker shoots. In all forms of the deep tap-rooted species an extensive lateral root system was developed within the surface 12 in. of soil — the organic A1 horizon; the tap-root and occasional secondary vertical descended, often unbranched, to the subsoil. The fibrous root system may arise from stem bases, rhizomes, tubers, or underground stocks (caudices). With the exception of underground stocks, which had extensive roots in the A2 and A3 to B horizons, the other forms of the fibrous root systems were confined to the A1 horizon. The marked concentration of roots in the organic A1 horizon was illustrated in dry weight–depth curves. Most of the roots in the A2, and A1 horizons arose from the caudex of Xanthorrhoea australis R.Br.; the remainder were vertical roots which passed directly into the subsoil from the deep-rooted species. About 70 per cent of the species recorded in the heath had morphological characteristics which enabled them to survive a fire and sprout from perennating buds buried under the surface of the ground. Thus, although the aerial organs of the heath were destroyed by fire, the root systems provided a reserve of food and nutrients for the regenerating heath. The dry weight of the root systems was therefore scarcely influenced by fire and thereafter steadily increased in the organic A1 horizon as the stand aged. The presence of root nodules on species of Leguminosae and Casuarinaoeae as well as of haustoria on Exocarpos sparteus R.Br. and Euphrasia collina R.Br.

Soil resource availability and disturbance are widely recognized as key drivers of plant community structure. However, the relative importance of different plant traits in determining species abundance following shifts in soil resource availability and disturbance remains little studied, particularly in long‐term experiments. 2. We studied trait‐based plant community assembly in a 27‐year grassland experiment where 25 plant species were sown into resident vegetation, after which annual manipulations of soil resource availability (five levels of superphosphate fertilizer; the highest level was also irrigated) and disturbance (three ‘mob‐grazed’ sheep grazing intensity levels: lax, moderate, hard) were applied. We used community assembly through trait selection (CATS) models based on entropy maximization to predict species relative abundances and to quantify the relative importance of each trait in determining abundance. 3. Plant species were primarily differentiated along a trade‐off axis corresponding to traits promoting rapid growth (e.g. high leaf [N] and specific leaf area [SLA]) vs. those promoting long leaf life span. Using 12 traits, the CATS model predicted &gt;80% of the variation in the relative abundances of 51 species, suggesting that trait‐based filtering was important. 4. Species with leaf attributes that reduce nutrient losses held a long‐term advantage under the lowest soil resource availability, whereas those associated with a rapid growth rate became dominant under soil resource addition. Species with thinner leaves were also favoured under greater soil resource availability, which may reflect a strategy to maximize SLA without sacrificing leaf density and thus maintain leaf structural defences under grazing disturbance. Greater leaf [S] and the ability to symbiotically fix atmospheric N were favoured under greater soil resource availability. Greater plant height, thinner leaves and higher leaf [N] were favoured under lower grazing intensity. 5. Synthesis. Our results highlight the importance of species functional differences to understand how plant communities react to increases in soil resource availability and disturbance, two important and inseparable components of land‐use change in grasslands world‐wide.",W1494416725,False,0.8631340265274048

With naturally occurring herbivory the presence of environmental variables that are correlated with herbivory and fitness will result in biased estimates of tolerance.

NATURAL SELECTION BY INSECTS AND COSTS OF RESISTANCE,"An important component of the process of coevolution between plants and their insect herbivores is the imposition of selection on plants by insects. Although such selection has been inferred from indirect evidence, little direct evidence for it exists. One goal of this study was to seek direct evidence by determining, for a single plant-herbivore system, whether insect herbivores impose selection on their host plants. A second goal was to determine whether costs are associated with genotypes that confer resistance to herbivores, as has been commonly postulated. The annual morning glory, Ipomoea purpurea, exhibits genetic variation in resistance to four different types of insects. For three of these types, most of the genetic variation is additive. Removal of insect herbivores increased the number of seeds produced by I. purpurea by 20% and eliminated additive genetic variation for seed number (fitness). This result implies that herbivores impose selection on some trait(s) of their host plants. Coupled with selection for decreased damage by corn earworms, as revealed by a negative additive genetic covariance between damage and fitness, this result suggests that insect herbivores impose selection on resistance to corn earworms in I. purpurea. Two types of cost of resistance to herbivores were sought in I. purpurea: 1) internal trade-offs in allocation of resources and 2) ecological trade-offs between resistances to different insects. No costs of either type were detected. This result suggests that cost-benefit arguments that attempt to predict the evolution of levels of resistance to herbivores are not applicable to I. purpurea.",W1983820029,False,0.8680499792098999

Summer and winter halves of the year were considered separately for the period 1910–1990. The summer half-year is defined as November–April, while the winter-half is May–October. Heavy rainfall is defined as the 90th and 95th percentiles of daily rainfall in each half-year. The magnitude of trends was derived from linear regression while statistical significance was determined by Kendall-Tau and field significance tests. Increasing trends in heavy rainfall and total rainfall have occurred during the summer half-year, but only 10–20% of stations have statistically significant trends. During the winter half-year, heavy rainfall and total rainfall have also increased, except in far southwest Western Australia and inland Queensland. There has been a reduction in the number of dry days in both halves of the year, except in far southwest Western Australia and at a few stations in eastern Australia where there has been an increase in the number of dry days in the winter half-year. Changes in the number of dry days were statistically significant at over 50% of stations. Hence there are regions showing coherent increases and decreases in rainfall which may be due to systematic changes in climate during the last century. Trends were averaged over three broad regions with adequate station coverage. There has been a general decrease in dry days with an increase in total and heavy rainfall intensity in the northeast and southeast, and a decrease in total and heavy rainfall in the southwest. These rainfall changes are related to changes in other climate variables such as temperature and cloud cover in Australia. © 1998 Royal Meteorological Society",W1966919913,False,0.30855613946914673

Highly-resolved vertical flux measurements from aircraft indicate that a significant amount of water vapor inflow may have been overlooked in past work of this kind, resulting in overestimates in precipitation efficiency. Trends in the mass of water vapor influx resolved at intervals of 10 to 30 min are corroborated by the evolution of water vapor flux convergence computed at 5-min intervals from objectively analyzed surface mesonetwork observations. Fluxes of water vapor inflow and precipitated rainwater are integrated over periods exceeding an hour to obtain precipitation efficiencies applicable to the mature storm phase. Precipitated rainwater estimates from radar reflectivity-rainrate relation-ship suffer from the usual uncertainties involved in single-parameter radar rainfall estimation, but neither the choice of a particular Z-R relation nor the upper reflectivity threshold assigned to compensate for the likely presence of hail changed the order of the storms when they were ranked according to their precipitation efficiency. This permits a meaningful comparison with environmental factors even though the absolute accuracy of the precipitation efficiencies is somewhat in doubt. Results indicate that factors controlling thunderstorm precipitation efficiency are more complicated than a simple inverse dependence on vertical wind shear, as advanced in earlier work, and that other environmental parameters undoubtedly come into play. In the present analyses, for example, subcloud mixing ratio, shear kinetic energy in the lower troposphere and cloud base area all exhibit weak positive correlations with precipitation efficiency, while there was a tendency for storms with high bases to display a slight inverse correlation.",W1978516856,False,0.02606905810534954

The CEI is based on an aggregate set of conventional climate extreme indicators, and the GCRI is composed of indicators that measure changes in the climate of the United States that have been projected to occur as a result of increased emissions of greenhouse gases. The CEI supports the notion that the climate of the United States has become more extreme in recent decades, yet the magnitude and persistence of the changes are not large enough at this point to conclude that the increase in extremes reflects a nonstationary climate. Nonetheless, if impacts due to extreme events rise exponentially with the index, then the increase may be quite significant in a practical sense. Similarly, the positive trend of the U. S. GCRI during the twentieth century is consistent with an enhanced greenhouse effect. The increase is unlikely to have arisen due to chance alone (there is about a 5% chance). Still, the increase of the GCRI is not large enough to unequivocally reject the possibility that the increase in the GCRI may be the result of other factors, including natural climate variability, and the similarity between the change in the GCRI and anticipated changes says little about the sensitivity of the climate system to the greenhouse effect. Both indices increased rather abruptly during the 1970s, a time of major circulation changes over the Pacific Ocean and North America.",W1989874885,False,0.025767456740140915

https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2006.01949.x,Highlighting the multiple drivers of change in interactions along stress gradients,"The prediction of Bertness & Callaway (1994) that facilitation should increase with increasing physical stress has been recently questioned in arid and semiarid environments, in particular since the publication of the meta-analysis of Maestre et al. (2005), which did not reveal any overall significant trend of variation in interactions in water-limited environments (but see Lortie & Callaway, 2006). Michalet (2006) recently proposed a methodological explanation for these inconsistencies in the literature and now a paper by Sthultz et al. in this issue of New Phytologist (pp. 135–145) adds further to this debate by testing the model of Bertness & Callaway (1994) along a water stress gradient and in accordance with Michalet's recommendations. 'A number of authors have stressed that facilitation, such as competition, can involve both above- and below-ground effects' Sthultz et al. analysed variation in biotic interactions between a foundation tree species, Pinus edulis, and a shrub, Fallugia paradoxa, in a semi-arid environment of southwestern USA. Sites were chosen at two levels of drought stress: four 'high-stress sites' at low elevation (approx. 1800 m), and four 'low-stress sites' at the ecotone with the P. ponderosa montane forests (approx. 2150 m). They used multiple approaches to test the prediction of Bertness & Callaway (1994) that competition should shift to facilitation with increasing water stress. The first approach was observational, sensu Maestre et al. (2005), in which P. edulis performance was compared below shrubs and in adjacent open areas. The second approach was experimental, whereby they compared P. edulis performance of individuals growing in controlled conditions (below the canopy of the shrub) with individuals growing in shrub patches where either all shrub shoots were severed at ground level or all above-ground parts were tied back. Furthermore, they also analysed the effect of P. edulis age and searched for temporal shifts in interactions during the course of the experiment, in relation to changes in climatic conditions. Both their observational and experimental approaches supported the model of Bertness & Callaway (1994). The direction and intensity of target responses were very similar with both methods at high-stress sites; P. edulis was as strongly facilitated and there were no differences in target responses between the removal and tied-back treatments, indicating that facilitation was only due to above-ground effects. At low-stress sites, the direction of interactions were also similar with both methods, but total competition for growth was more important in the experiment than in the observational study and both above-ground competition and below-ground competition were observed. There was no significant effect of P. edulis age at the high-stress sites, whereas at the low-stress sites competition increased with seedling age. At the high-stress sites, facilitation occurred during the driest periods, in spring and summer, whereas at the low-stress sites, competition occurred during the mildest periods, in autumn and winter. Sthultz et al. primarily found that competition shifted to facilitation along a gradient of increasing stress, which definitely supports the model of Bertness & Callaway (1994). This result may seem quite trivial when we know that in the last 10 yr this theoretical prediction has been recurrently supported. However, we want to highlight a number of other results that we consider may improve our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying biotic interactions within plant communities. First, this main result was found using both an observational and an experimental approach (sensu Maestre et al., 2005), and for both growth and survival performances, which renders it less trivial. Maestre et al. (2005) found in a meta-analysis conducted on arid and semiarid environments that growth responses (but not survival responses) were generally positive when authors compared the performance of target species beneath nurse species and in adjacent open areas (observational studies), whereas competition was often detected when authors used removal procedures (experimental studies). Michalet (2006) argued that the time and spatial scales of these interactions were quite different and that the facilitation seen in observational studies was in general a complex process mainly due to differences in soils occurring between open and vegetated areas. In other words, plants may compete at the patch scale, as demonstrated with removal procedures, whereas soil engineering by nurse species may produce positive effects at a much longer temporal scale; these latter effects may only be depicted at a larger spatial scale with observational studies. The similar results observed by Sthultz et al. with both methods demonstrated that F. paradoxa directly facilitated P. edulis at the high-stress sites. However, we suggest that there were likely to be soil differences between the open and shrub patches, at least in the low-stress sites, because competition was twice as high at these sites when measured with the removal procedures than when measured with the observational method. A number of authors have stressed that facilitation, such as competition, can involve both above- and below-ground effects. However, contrary to competition studies, few experiments focusing on facilitation have separated both effects (but see Holzapfel & Mahall, 1999; Maestre et al., 2003). A second important result of the study of Sthultz et al. was to demonstrate that at the high-stress sites the beneficial effect of the shrub was only above ground, whereas at the low-stress sites both above- and below-ground parts of the shrub negatively affected P. edulis. This result observed with the experimental approach stressed the importance of shade as the main mechanism of direct facilitation in their system. Because there were no differences in the intensity of facilitation measured by the two approaches (observational and experimental), complex facilitation (sensu Michalet, 2006) involving soil differences between open areas and shrub patches were very unlikely to have affected P. edulis in this system, which is in contrast with other semiarid systems (Pugnaire et al., 2004). These differences may be related to the species involved in the interactions and is discussed further later on. A third important result of the study by Sthultz et al. was to show that the direction of interactions may change during the life history of the target species, at least at their low-stress sites where they observed an increasing negative effect of the shrub as pine seedlings aged. Furthermore, they related the results of another experiment conducted in the same high-stress sites, where the authors found that different shrub species, including F. paradoxa, had strong negative effects on the growth of older P. edulis individuals than those of their own experiment. However, factors other than target age may explain these different results, and in particular differences in climatic conditions (Greenlee & Callaway, 1996), because the two experiments were not conducted during the same year. A number of authors have also found a switch from facilitation to competition increases with target age, particularly in experiments involving a tree species as the target (Kunstler et al., 2006), although contrasting results have been found by Lamaze et al. (2003). Lastly, another interesting result of this study was to show that temporal changes in interactions during the course of the experiment were consistent with spatial changes along the elevation gradient. This result is in agreement with those of other studies observed either between years and experiments (Greenlee & Callaway, 1996; Gomez-Aparicio et al., 2004) or between seasons in a single experiment (Holzapfel & Mahall, 1999; Kikvidze et al., 2006). However, other authors found contrasting results and either a decreasing importance of facilitation (Kitzberger et al., 2000) or an increasing importance of competition (Tielbörger & Kadmon, 2000) during the driest climatic events of their studies. Sthultz et al. concluded that interactions between spatial and temporal scales that influence the net interactions between plants, such as those seen in this study, may help to explain why several recent studies do not support the prediction of Bertness & Callaway (1994). We suggest that, together with the influence of target age shown by Sthultz et al., factors other than temporal shifts should be included in experiments and theoretical models to explain some inconsistencies found in the literature for dry environments (Maestre et al., 2005). Among them, we would like to highlight the importance of the species involved in the experiments, in particular in dry environments. The study of Sthultz et al. concerned only two interacting species, while there are now several lines of evidence to indicate that changing the nature of either the nurse or the target species may produce, within the same spatial and temporal scales, substantially different results in either intensity or direction. The effect of the functional type of nurses involved in the interactions is obvious in the literature. Gomez-Aparicio et al. (2004) showed in a meta-analysis conducted on 11 woody species planted within 16 different nurse species that the most important positive effects were found when seedlings were planted within legumes and the most important negative effects within rockroses (Cistus species, known for their allelopathic compounds), with intermediate positive effects for other shrubs. The somewhat exceptional positive effect of legumes is known from a number of other studies (Pugnaire et al., 2004), but the dominant negative effect of some functional groups is certainly not restricted to allelopathic plants, such as Cistus sp. There are increasing lines of experimental evidence (Kunstler et al., 2006; Picon-Cochard et al., 2006) showing that grass species are certainly very poor nurse species, which is probably a result of their strong ability to take up soil resources, as well as their weak light interception, as compared with shrubs (Köchy & Wilson, 2000). Maestre et al. (2003) have shown, in particular, the strong competitive effect of Stipa tenacissima, a widespread dominant species of the North African steppes also present in the same environments of southeast Spain where Pugnaire et al. (2004) and others described the strong facilitative effect of the legume Retama sphaerocarpa. The effect of the target species seems more complex. In some studies, stress-tolerant light-demanding species have been shown to be less facilitated than stress-intolerant shade-demanding species (Liancourt et al., 2005; Pages & Michalet, 2006). For example, Gomez-Aparicio et al. (2004) showed in their meta-analysis that pines were the least facilitated among all of their ligneous target species. But it has been shown in a number of other studies that, when associated with grass nurses, stress-intolerant tree species are more negatively affected than stress-tolerant tree species (Kunstler et al., 2006); furthermore, the negative effect of the grass generally increases with increasing water stress (Davis et al., 1998; Maestre et al., 2003). This latter result is inconsistent with the model of Bertness & Callaway (1994) but supports the model of Taylor et al. (1990) of increasing competition with decreasing resource availability. These contrasting results may be explained by the balance between positive and negative effects, which is very likely to change depending on the constraint of the system and the functional strategies of both the nurse and target species. When the main constraint is above ground (high vapour pressure deficit, VPD), a stress-intolerant target species is the most likely to be facilitated, in particular with a nurse efficiently intercepting light, and this positive effect generally increases with increasing VPD. In contrast, when the main constraint is below ground (e.g. low water availability), a water-demanding species is the most likely to be negatively affected by neighbours, in particular when neighbours are grasses, and this negative effect generally increases with increasing drought. The switch from competition to facilitation with increasing water stress found by Sthultz et al. in northern Arizona may have been driven, in part, by the functional characteristics of the interacting species and the limiting factors involved in these interactions (VPD vs soil water stress). For example, Callaway et al. (1996) also found, in a very similar environment in western Nevada, a significant facilitation for another stress-tolerant and closely related pine species (Pinus monophylla) growing in association with Artemisia tridentata, but a significant competition from the sagebrush for a more water-demanding species, Pinus ponderosa. However, further experiments are needed to test the hypothesis that competition should increase for this latter species with increasing water stress, because this study was not designed along a stress gradient.",W1487174155,False,0.6643625497817993
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12599,Spatial and temporal aridity gradients provide poor proxies for plant–plant interactions under climate change: a large‐scale experiment,"Summary Plant–plant interactions may critically modify the impact of climate change on plant communities. However, the magnitude and even direction of potential future interactions remains highly debated, especially for water‐limited ecosystems. Predictions range from increasing facilitation to increasing competition with future aridification. The different methodologies used for assessing plant–plant interactions under changing environmental conditions may affect the outcome but they are not equally represented in the literature. Mechanistic experimental manipulations are rare compared with correlative approaches that infer future patterns from current observations along spatial climatic gradients. Here, we utilize a unique climatic gradient in combination with a large‐scale, long‐term experiment to test whether predictions about plant–plant interactions yield similar results when using experimental manipulations, spatial gradients or temporal variation. We assessed shrub–annual interactions in three different sites along a natural rainfall gradient (spatial) during 9 years of varying rainfall (temporal) and 8 years of dry and wet manipulations of ambient rainfall (experimental) that closely mimicked regional climate scenarios. The results were fundamentally different among all three approaches. Experimental water manipulations hardly altered shrub effects on annual plant communities for the assessed fitness parameters biomass and survival. Along the spatial gradient, shrub effects shifted from clearly negative to mildly facilitative towards drier sites, whereas temporal variation showed the opposite trend: more negative shrub effects in drier years. Based on our experimental approach, we conclude that shrub–annual interaction will remain similar under climate change. In contrast, the commonly applied space‐for‐time approach based on spatial gradients would have suggested increasing facilitative effects with climate change. We discuss potential mechanisms governing the differences among the three approaches. Our study highlights the critical importance of long‐term experimental manipulations for evaluating climate change impacts. Correlative approaches, for example along spatial or temporal gradients, may be misleading and overestimate the response of plant–plant interactions to climate change.",W1892848628,False,0.7211501598358154

https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12592,Does the stress‐gradient hypothesis hold water? Disentangling spatial and temporal variation in plant effects on soil moisture in dryland systems,"Summary The nature of the relationship between water limitation and facilitation has been one of the most contentious debates surrounding the stress‐gradient hypothesis ( SGH ), which states that plant‐plant interactions shift from competition to facilitation with increasing environmental stress. We take a closer look at the potential role of soil moisture in mediating plant‐plant interaction outcomes by assessing effects of climate and soil texture on plant modulation of soil moisture. Using an empirically‐parameterized soil moisture model, we simulated soil moisture dynamics beneath shrubs and in un‐vegetated coarse and fine soils for 1000 sites in the Western United States with &lt;700 mm mean annual precipitation. This threshold reflects the transition from dryland (&lt;600 mm precipitation) to mesic ecosystems. Positive effects of shrubs on shallow soil moisture (i.e. the difference between shrub and interspace soil moisture) decreased along the aridity gradient when long‐term average conditions were considered, contrary to expectations based on the SGH. Negative effects of shrubs on deeper soil moisture also increased with aridity. However, when extreme years were considered, positive effects of shrub on soil moisture were greatest at intermediate points along the spatial aridity gradient, consistent with a hump‐backed model of plant‐plant interactions. When viewed through time within a site, shrub effects on shallow soil moisture were positively related to precipitation, with more complex relationships exhibited in deeper soils Taken together, the results of this simulation study suggest that plant effects on soil moisture are predictable based on relatively general relationships between precipitation inputs and differential evaporation and transpiration rates between plant and interspace microsites that are largely driven by temperature. In particular, this study highlights the importance of differentiating between temporal and spatial variation in weather and climate, respectively, in determining plant effects on available soil moisture. Rather than focusing on the somewhat coarse‐scale predictions of the SGH, it may be more beneficial to explicitly incorporate plant effects on soil moisture into predictive models of plant‐plant interaction outcomes in drylands.",W1865793349,False,0.7502745389938354

While the relationship between facilitation and competition has been explored extensively in recent years, there is also a natural link between facilitation and mutualism, as both are interspecific interactions that confer benefits. Yet, the relationship between these two interactions has been minimally explored. 2. Here, I explore parallels and differences between mutualism and facilitation. Five focal areas organize current research on mutualism evolution: trait evolution; the continuum from specialization to generalization; the evolutionary origins and maintenance of the interaction; co‐evolution of partners; and the prevalence and implications of cheating. These foci are also helpful for investigating how facilitation evolves, a much less explored issue. 3. Testable hypotheses regarding the evolution of facilitation include the following: selection should be stronger on traits of facilitated species than on traits of facilitators; facilitative interactions with mutualistic (++) and commensal (+0) outcomes should exhibit greater evolutionary stability than those with antagonistic (+−) outcomes; co‐evolution should be possible in mutualistic and antagonistic facilitation only; when co‐evolution occurs, it should produce a geographic mosaic of interaction outcomes; and antagonistic facilitation could lead to selection on facilitators to either escape or to tolerate the neighbours that benefit from them. 4. Synthesis. Three gaps in our knowledge currently impede progress on evolutionary questions surrounding facilitation. First, reciprocal effects are rarely investigated; facilitation might evolve like mutualism, commensalism or antagonism, depending on effects on the facilitator species. Secondly, the genetics of relevant traits are not yet well explored; the traits themselves are better known for facilitator species than for the facilitated, which are more likely to evolve in the context of the interaction. Finally, the fitness costs and benefits associated with facilitation have rarely been measured. Filling these gaps should permit rapid progress in understanding how facilitation arises, persists and evolves.",W1965654648,False,0.12092757225036621

Infected fish harboured plerocercoid loads that contributed from 1·1 to 33·9% of their total mass. Across this range of infection levels, the presence of S. solidus infection had no significant directional effect on standard length ( L S ) corrected meal size of host three‐spined sticklebacks. Amongst multiply infected fish there was a significant negative relationship between L S ‐corrected meal size and the proportion of host mass contributed by S. solidus parasites. This relationship, however, did not hold for singly‐infected fish. Furthermore, the data suggest that multiply‐infected fish that harbour a combined mass of parasites contributing &lt; c. 15% to host body mass might exhibit meal sizes that exceed those of length‐matched uninfected fish. The results suggest that although heavy infections can significantly reduce the meal size of heavily infected three‐spined sticklebacks, in the early stages of multiple S. solidus infections host food intake may increase. The probable causes of these differential effects on meal size and their consequences for the host‐parasite system are discussed.",W1976889866,False,0.5561292171478271

Comparisons of the extractable haemolymph volumes from uninfected and infected G. pulex, when related to host tissue weight, showed that there was no difference in the host tissue/haemolymph volume ratio between infected and uninfected individuals. SDS-PAGE of haemolymph samples resolved 36 bands of protein, the major components being band 6(19 kDa) and 21(33 kDa). Densitometric analysis of haemolymph samples showed that infected gammarids had total protein concentrations elevated by 84%.

In general, reproductive activities resulted in significantly lower levels of body condition in three‐spined stickleback during the latter part of the breeding season, and relatively high levels of S. solidus infection intensified the energetic drain. Although female body condition did not differ significantly due just to the presence of S. solidus, increased parasite index did have a significant negative effect on female body condition. Males showed significantly lower levels of body condition in response to S. solidus infection alone and in association with a greater parasite index. Males had greater mean parasite indices than females. Females had significantly lower body condition than males, which may be due to discrepancies in energy expenditure between the sexes during reproduction. Females with greater body condition were significantly more likely to produce a clutch of eggs than those with lower condition, suggesting a threshold effect of body condition on reproductive capacity.",W1533910287,False,0.7089756727218628

In addition, uncontrolled concomitant infections may confound results. In this study we experimentally infected individual laboratory-bred female three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus L. with the pseudophyllidean cestode Schistocephalus solidus [Müller], and compared the morphology and growth patterns of infected females with sham-exposed controls over a 16-week period. Fish were fed a ration of 8% body weight per day. Non-invasive image analysis techniques allowed the growth of individual plerocercoids to be tracked in vivo throughout the course of infection, and patterns of host and parasite growth were determined. Females that developed infections diverged morphometrically from unexposed control females and exposed-uninfected females at 6 weeks post-infection, with the width of the body at the pectoral fins giving the earliest indication of infection success. When including the plerocercoid, infected females gained weight more quickly than controls, but when plerocercoid weight was removed this trend was reversed. There was no effect of infection on the increase in fish length. Plerocercoids grew at different rates in individual hosts, and exhibited measurable sustained weight increases of up to 10% per day. Final estimates of plerocercoid weight from morphometric analysis prior to autopsy were accurate to within +/−17% of actual plerocercoid weight. At autopsy, infected female sticklebacks had significantly lower perivisceral fat reserves but had developed significantly larger ovaries than controls. The results are discussed in relation to previous studies examining natural infections, and the value of utilizing experimental infections to examine ecological aspects of host–parasite interactions is discussed.",W1967819572,False,0.8177979588508606

Both satellite datasets are part of the Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) B3 product. It was demonstrated that it is now possible to derive long-term surface SW↓, which can be useful in climate studies, and that the accuracy of the derived fields is sufficient to detect interannual differences that can exceed at times 70 W m−2. The variability of the daily totals of SW↓ from the monthly means was similar during three of the four years investigated, yet, during the El Niño year of 1982–83, north of 10°N such variability increased drastically.

https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05455.x,The future of tropical forests,"Five anthropogenic drivers–land use change, wood extraction, hunting, atmospheric change, climate change–will largely determine the future of tropical forests. The geographic scope and intensity of these five drivers are in flux. Contemporary land use change includes deforestation (∼64,000 km 2 yr −1 for the entire tropical forest biome) and natural forests regenerating on abandoned land (∼21,500 km 2 yr −1 with just 29% of the biome evaluated). Commercial logging is shifting rapidly from Southeast Asia to Africa and South America, but local fuelwood consumption continues to constitute 71% of all wood production. Pantropical rates of net deforestation are declining even as secondary and logged forests increasingly replace old‐growth forests. Hunters reduce frugivore, granivore and browser abundances in most forests. This alters seed dispersal, seed and seedling survival, and hence the species composition and spatial template of plant regeneration. Tropical governments have responded to these local threats by protecting 7% of all land for the strict conservation of nature—a commitment that is only matched poleward of 40°S and 70°N. Protected status often fails to stop hunters and is impotent against atmospheric and climate change. There are increasing reports of stark changes in the structure and dynamics of protected tropical forests. Four broad classes of mechanisms might contribute to these changes. Predictions are developed to distinguish among these mechanisms.",W1621735046,False,0.7359822392463684

https://doi.org/10.2307/2256610,The Universal Features of Zonation Between Tide-Marks on Rocky Coasts,"So much has already been discovered about life between tide-marks that it has become difficult to see the wood for the trees. Yet despite the host of publications dealing with intertidal life, the field untouched is so vast that our knowledge of the natural laws which control intertidal affairs is still elementary. For these reasons we must examine intertidal arrangements, where possible, on a broad scale as well as intensively. Until recently there has been a stronger tendency to study the problems of tidal biology in great detail on a small scale than in less detail on a large one. This has resulted in many accounts of the natural history of individual plant and animal species, and in numerous descriptions of the occurrence of plants, animals (or both) in small areas varying in size from square yards, individual rock-pools or narrow traverses to short stretches of coastline, estuaries and similar areas. The general examination of long stretches of coast, or of the coastlines of whole countries, has lagged far behind the more detailed studies, and there have been few examples of it. We have, it is true, such surveys as those of Fischer-Piette on the European coasts, of Ricketts on the Pacific coast of North America, and of the present authors and their collaborators in South Africa; but the list is not a long one. Recent progress in intertidal studies has been ably summarized by Fischer-Piette (1940), and the volume in which his paper appears represents, as a whole, an important contribution to the subject. At the present time there is evidence of a tendency to undertake the examination of long coastlines more readily than before, and this is of course facilitated by car and plane travel, and by the construction of roads in many places which were previously inaccessible. An example of such work is the survey, by Dakin and his assistants, of 1000 miles of coastline in New South Wales, the results of which were published in 1948. A series by R. G. Evans on parts of the British coast is at present appearing, and while this deals with much shorter stretches, its point of view is a broad one, looking towards an eventual general account of the British coasts.

Because fishes have pervasive effects on ecosystems through species‐specific food web interactions, alterations to species and functional richness, and composition of natural assemblages could have negative effects on aquatic ecosystem function. In this study, I tested the effects of fish species and functional richness, and assemblage composition on primary production (PPR), benthic invertebrate density, and benthic particulate organic matter (BPOM) in a 42‐day experiment in artificial stream mesocosms. I found that fish species richness and assemblage composition were important predictors of PPR in stream mesocosms. However, the effect of species richness on PPR increased with time, suggesting that richness‐related effects might strengthen as the magnitude of community‐level interactions increases in ecosystems. There was no effect of fish species or functional richness or assemblage composition on benthic invertebrate densities or BPOM. These data provide additional support that fishes can be important regulators of ecosystem function in aquatic systems, and suggest that positive effects of fishes on ecosystems can be strengthened by increased species richness and composition of the assemblage. This study broadens the applicability of the biodiversity ecosystem‐function literature to a new suite of taxa, supporting the overall hypothesis that ecosystem functions and services are likely to decline in response to species extinctions.",W1979478303,False,0.8382587432861328

The oxygen consumption is approximately proportional to the 0·7 power of the dry weight : it is not proportional to the estimated surface area. This relationship between oxygen consumption and dry weight is the same at 10 and at 20° C. The rate of oxygen consumption at 20° C. is greater than at 10° C. by a factor of 2·6. During growth the percentage of dry matter of 4th-instar larvae increases from 10 to 16 and the specific gravity from 1·030 to 1043. The change in the dry weight/wet weight ratio during the 4th larval instar supports the theory of heterauxesis. At 20° C., ‘summer’ larvae respire faster than ‘winter’ larvae.",W1937643132,False,0.7922962307929993

The purpose of the strategy was to retain a maximum of the original variation in important soil properties with only a small selection of samples. The evaluation was made with emphasis on clay content, soil organic matter, cation exchange capacity, and base saturation, all of which are important factors for biochemical activities in the soil and, therefore, for soil fertility. The strategy involved use of near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with principal component analysis (PCA). A 2-nm interval spectrum between 1300 and 2398 nm was recorded on 146 air-dried soil samples from the most important cultivated areas in Sweden. The samples were considered mainly Cambisols and Regosols. The first derivative of each NIR spectrum was used for PCA. Twenty soils were selected by visual examination of two-dimensional score-plots from PCA. Score-plots were made from NIR data alone, from NIR data combined with pH, and from the eight significant score vectors from PCA on NIR data, combined with pH. Two criteria for selection from these plots were applied: (i) one sample from each apparent group was selected and (ii) samples evenly distributed at the periphery of the total sample population, and one in the center, were selected. In all, six selections were made. The distributions in soil properties in the selections were compared with random selection and with the original population. It was clear that NIR could help to improve the diversity in sample selections compared with random selection. In general, peripheral selections generated a higher recovery of range and a more even distribution in soil parameters than cluster selections. For clay content and cation exchange capacity, PCA on NIR data alone gave the best results, but to improve the distribution in pH and the pH-dependent base saturation, pH had to be included in PCA. To select soil samples that are distributed in all five soil parameters to the best extent possible, we propose peripheral selection from a two-dimensional PCA plot calculated from score vectors and pH data. In the present study, this method would have reduced costs about 70% compared with wet chemistry analyzes.",W2001345717,False,0.041211359202861786

To obtain a better response from inputs in agriculture, cost-effective soil analysis is needed to enable site-specific applications. Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) technology has the potential to provide a rapid, low-cost analysis enabling within field variability to be identified. NIRS was evaluated for its ability to predict a range of soil properties in the Riverine Plain soils of southern New South Wales. Over 550 topsoil (0-10�cm) and 300 subsoil (40-50 cm) samples from a range of soil types were air dried and ground before scanning with a NIRSystems model 6500 scanning spectrophotometer. The Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression procedure was used to determine the best correlation (i.e. calibration) between the chemical reference data and spectral data for both topsoil and subsoil samples. A validation set of samples was used to test the predictive ability of NIRS for a number of soil properties. The results demonstrated that NIRS can successfully determine some soil properties in both the topsoil and subsoil. In the topsoil, cation exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable Ca and Mg, pH and Ca : Mg ratio were predicted with a high level of accuracy and organic carbon and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) with an acceptable level of accuracy. In the subsoil, CEC, exchangeable Na, Ca, Mg, ESP, pH and Ca : Mg ratio were all predicted with a high degree of accuracy. The predictive ability of NIRS for many soil constituents may make it suitable for use in agricultural soil assessment for site-specific agriculture in the Riverine Plain soils of southern New South Wales.",W1529574768,False,0.10550284385681152

https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/14.4.1151,Niche Shape and Genetic Aspects of Character Displacement,"Character displacement involving a single, diallelic locus in each of two competing species is investigated via computer simulation. The niche, as the sum of the utilization efficiencies of the population for combinations of environmental variables, is distinguished from the resource peak, which is a set of combinations of environmental variables actually present at exploitable frequencies in the environment. The two populations compete for a single resource peak made up of five subunits. Each genotype in each species has an optimum peak subunit, but survives in all of them. The intermediate subunit is optimal for a genotype in each species. Movement is restricted between subunits, which are thus treated here as microhabitats. The simulation covers a geographical range with each species occurring alone where its birth rate is high, with the birth rate declining as the range of the other species is approached; sympatry occurs in a region of intermediate birth rates for both species. The character displacement involves characters determined by the genotypes at the competition locus. The shape of the resource peak has a profund effect on the form taken by character displacement. A “steep” peak (one with the intermediate subunit much more frequent than the rest) results in a sharp step in the morphoclines, with two stable equilibrium points at the point of equal birth rates. A “bimodal” peak (one with equally frequent subunits, each optimum for a genotype for one species only) leads to a gradual change. Other peak types also have characteristic effects, showing that ecological inferences can be drawn from the form taken by character displacement.",W1998327012,False,0.7836920619010925

This progress is largely the result of the establishment of rigorous criteria for demonstrating character displacement in the animal literature. There are, however, relatively few well-supported examples of character displacement in plants. This review explores the potential for character displacement in plants by addressing the following questions: (1) Why aren't examples of character displacement in plants more common? (2) What are the requirements for character displacement to occur and how do plant populations meet those requirements? (3) What are the criteria for testing the pattern and process of character displacement and what methods can and have been used to address these criteria in the plant literature? (4) What are some additional approaches for studying character displacement in plants? While more research is needed, the few plant systems in which character displacement hypotheses have been rigorously tested suggest that character displacement may play a role in shaping plant communities. Plants are especially amenable to character displacement studies because of the experimental ease with which they can be used in common gardens, selection analyses, and breeding designs. A deeper investigation of character displacement in plants is critical for a more complete understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes that permit the coexistence of plant species.",W2004220668,False,0.5499580502510071

A classic example of reproductive character displacement, presumed to be caused by reinforcing selection, is flower-color variation in the native Texas wildflower Phlox drummondii. Here, we use population genetic analyses to investigate molecular signatures of selection on flower-color variation in this species. First, we quantify patterns of neutral genetic variation across the range of P. drummondii to demonstrate that restricted gene flow and genetic drift cannot explain the pattern of flower-color divergence in this species. There is evidence of extensive gene flow across populations with different flower colors, suggesting selection caused flower-color divergence. Second, analysis of sequence variation in the genes underlying this divergence reveals a signature of a selective sweep in one of the two genes, further indicating selection is responsible for divergence in sympatry. The lack of a signature of selection at the second locus does not necessarily indicate a lack of selection on this locus but instead brings attention to the uncertainty in depending on molecular signatures to identify selection.",W1519665771,False,0.11554410308599472

Theoretical studies demonstrate that evolution of polygenic characters depends heavily on the genetic interdependence of the expression of traits in the different environments in which selection occurs, but information concerning this issue is scarce. We conducted a field experiment to assess the genetic variability of the annual plant Nemophila menziesii in five biotic regimes differing in plant density and composition. Significant, though modest, additive genetic variance in plant size was expressed in particular treatments. Evidence of additive genetic tradeoffs between interspecific and intraspecific competitive performance was found, but this result was not consistent throughout the experiment. Two aspects of experimental design may tend to obscure genetically based tradeoffs across environments in many previously published experiments: (1) inability to isolate additive genetic from other sources of variation and (2) use of novel (e.g., laboratory) environments.",W1865159354,False,0.6393210291862488

Previous studies reporting error rates have focused on estimating the effects of both randomly distributed and locus‐specific errors. Sample‐specific errors, however, can also significantly affect results in population studies despite a large sample size. From two studies including six microsatellite markers genotyped from 272 sperm whale DNA samples, and 33 microsatellites genotyped from 213 bowhead whales, we investigated the effects of sample‐ and locus‐specific errors on calculations of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. The results of a jackknife analysis in these two studies identified seven individuals that were highly influential on estimates of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium for six different markers. In each case, the influential individual was homozygous for a rare allele. Our results demonstrate that Hardy–Weinberg P values are very sensitive to homozygosity in rare alleles for single individuals, and that &gt; 50% of these cases involved genotype errors likely due to low sample quality. This raises the possibility that even small, normal levels of laboratory errors can result in an overestimate of the degree to which markers are out of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and hence overestimate population structure. To avoid such bias, we recommend routine identification of influential individuals and multiple replications of those samples.",W1517529839,False,0.20210497081279755

In this study, metabolic activity of grape roots of different ages was assessed by excised root respiration and tetrazolium chloride reduction. We investigated changes in metabolic activity and patterns of cell death occurring with root age and changes in root pigmentation. Tetrazolium chloride reduction of roots of different ages was strongly correlated to respiration ( R 2 = 0.786). As roots aged, respiration and tetrazolium chloride reduction declined similarly, with minimum metabolic activity reached at six weeks. Tetrazolium chloride reduction indicated that the onset of root browning corresponded to a 77% reduction in metabolic activity ( P &lt; 0.001). Anatomical examination of roots at each pigmentation stage showed that even though some cells in brown roots were still alive, these roots were functionally dead. The effect of using different definitions of root death in relation to root survivorship was determined in a study of ‘Concord’ grapes with two pruning treatments, using three criteria for root death: browning, blackening or shriveling, and disappearance. There was no effect of vine pruning on root life span when life span was defined as the time from first appearance to the onset of browning. However, if death was judged as the point when roots either became black or shriveled or disappeared, vine pruning decreased root life span by 34% and 40%, respectively ( P &lt; 0.001), and also increased the decay constant for root decomposition by about 45% ( P &lt; 0.001).

However, the dynamics of individual roots with different life cycles, such as ephemeral and perennial, during root system development are still unknown. We examined individual roots during fine root system development in a mature stand of Chamaecyparis obtusa Sieb. et Zucc. (Cupressaceae) using the sequential ingrowth core method and an anatomical method. The visual classification, i.e., orange, red, brown, intact dead, and fragmented dead, of fine roots corresponded well with the anatomical classification. Orange and red roots contained passage cells, and brown roots contained cork cambium. The proportions of protoxylem groups differed among visual classes. Brown secondary roots were mainly triarch (43%) and tetrarch (40%) and rarely diarch (12%), whereas fragmented dead roots, which constituted more than 95% of the dead roots, were mainly diarch (67%). These results imply that triarch and tetrarch roots tend to form secondary roots, whereas diarch roots tend to become dead roots without secondary growth. Using the numbers of root tips and clusters, root system development could be classified into three stages: colonization, branching within the root system, and maintenance. During the colonization stage, mainly triarch and tetrarch roots, which tend to be secondary growth, invaded ingrowth cores. During the branching stage, primarily diarch roots, which tend to be ephemeral, emerged. Fine root system development involved the recruitment of different individual roots during the life cycle depending on the growth stage.",W1972331421,False,0.13505342602729797

Anatomy and Permeability of the White and Tannin Zones,"Abstract Growing tree roots are characteristically brown with white tips. The browning process, which occurs as the white region matures, has often been attributed to the deposition of suberin in various tissues. However, in pouch‐grown tree seedlings of jack pine ( Pinus banksiana Lamb.) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus pilularis Sm.), browning was not linked to suberization but was caused by the deposition of condensed tannins in the walls of all cells external to the stele. Therefore, we propose using the term “tannin zone” to refer to this region of the root. Vitality tests indicated that the cells of the epidermis and cortex were alive in white regions but were dead in brown regions. Following sequential treatment with berberine hemisulfate and potassium thiocyanate, the cortical walls external to the endodermal Casparian band were full of berberine thiocyanate crystals, indicating that they were permeable to berberine. These walls should also be permeable to water and ions, which have smaller molecular dimensions than the tracer dye. Based on the anatomy and permeability of the tannin zone, we predict that its capacity for ion uptake would be reduced compared to the white zone because of a reduced absorptive plasmalemma surface area. In jack pine, some uptake could be effected by the passage cells of the endodermis. The tannin zone should be even less absorptive in eucalyptus because the exodermis remains an apoplastic barrier and the endodermis lacks passage cells. It is difficult to predict the difference between the tannin and white zones with respect to water uptake. Death of the cells external to the endodermis would reduce the resistance of the root to water movement, but deposition of tannins would increase it. The deposition of suberin lamellae in increasing numbers of endodermal cells may also retard water flow. The anatomy and physiological properties of the tannin zone are unique from those of the distal, white zone and the proximal, cork‐clad zone.",W2040430291,False,0.1273571103811264

During 7 d of rapid drying (in containers with a 3‐cm depth of vermiculite), the rate of root growth decreased sharply and most root apices died; such a determinate pattern of root growth was not due to meristem exhaustion but rather to meristem mortality after 3 d of drying. The length of the meristem, the duration of the cell division cycle, and the length of the elongation zone were unchanged during rapid drying. During 14 d of gradual drying (in containers with a 6‐cm depth of vermiculite), root mortality was relatively low; the length of the elongation zone decreased by 70%, the number of meristematic cells decreased 30%, and the duration of the cell cycle increased by 36%. Root hydraulic conductivity ( L P ) decreased to one half during both drying treatments; L P was restored by 2 d of rewetting owing to the emergence of lateral roots following rapid drying and to renewed apical elongation following gradual drying. Thus, in response to drought, the apical meristems of roots of O. ficus‐indica near the surface die, whereas deeper in the substrate cell division and elongation in root apices continue. Water uptake in response to rainfall in the field can be enhanced by lateral root proliferation near the soil surface and additionally by resumption of apical growth for deeper roots.",W1963631344,False,0.837768018245697

In comparison with the spinach leaf explants, the uptake of GB by rapeseed tissues was restricted, probably by the destabilizing effects exerted by GB in this plant material. In contrast, the viability of spinach leaf discs, as assessed by their capacity to reduce 2,3,5‐triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), was not affected, suggesting that the GB taken up was compatible in the leaf tissues of the GB accumulator. In rapeseed leaf discs treated with GB, chlorophyll loss as well as significant changes in polyamine content were induced, leading to a dramatic increase of the putrescine/(spermidine + spermine) ratio. In contrast, this ratio remained constant in the GB treated spinach explants, suggesting that spinach has the capacity to stabilize polyamine metabolism in the presence of high amounts of GB. The treatment of spinach leaf discs with GB prior to application of osmotic or salt shocks provided protection from stress. A weak capacity to accumulate proline under stress conditions was partially suppressed. The protein content decreased while the free amino acid level increased independently of the presence of GB.

Manganese concentrations in shoot xylem and phloem sap were significantly lower in chlorotic trees than in neighboring healthy trees. The Mn concentration of root sap was also lower in these Mn-deficient trees than in healthy trees, indicating reduced Mn uptake by Mn-deficient trees. Although Mn deficiency had no effect on the Mn concentration of whole roots, separation of root tissue into root cortex and stele (wood) suggested impaired translocation of Mn from the cortex to the stele in Mn-deficient trees. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) tests indicated that there was no decrease in reducing capacity of the fine roots (< 1 mm in diameter) of Mn-deficient trees. Fine roots of Mn-deficient trees contained significantly more organic acids than fine roots of healthy trees, including increased concentrations of malic, quinic, trans-acontic and formic acid; however, concentrations of pyruvic and acetic acid were lower than in fine roots of healthy trees. The total amounts of organic acids in the rhizospheric soil were similar for healthy and Mn-deficient trees.

According to the phalanx efficiency and guerilla efficiency hypotheses, the removal of shoot apices disrupts apical dominance and increases branching, which in turn, increases shoot interference within the plant and/or reduces foraging efficiency. Hence, we predicted that shoot apex removal would result in an undercompensation growth response rather than the compensation or overcompensation commonly reported for upright species. Plant architecture was represented by patterns of allocation of meristems to three possible developmental fates: growth, reproduction, and inactivity. Clipping had no effect on architecture or fitness estimates (biomass, total number of meristems, and ramet production) in T. repens or G. hederacea. Fitness estimates were reduced by clipping in P. anserina, but branching intensity was unaffected. Foraging was compromised since clipped plants were unable to resume horizontal extension. In E. polygonifolia, clipping also reduced fitness estimates but without any effect on branching intensity. Since this species is naturally highly branched (i.e., with weak apical dominance), there may be little opportunity to increase branching intensity by removing apical meristems. In P. aviculare and F. virginiana, the removal of shoot apices resulted in reduced apical dominance and increased branching intensity and this was accompanied by reduced fitness estimates.

In the first experiment, clones were grown from either one unrooted ramet or from either one, two or three connected, rooted ramets, for 8 weeks, in either nutrient‐rich or nutrient‐poor sand. The survival, number of ramets and dry weight of the clones produced were dependent on the number of established ramets at the start of the experiment. Clones in nutrient‐rich sand developed a greater number of ramets, stolon branches, total length of stolon, mean leaf area per ramet and total leaf area per clone than clones of corresponding initial size in nutrient‐poor sand. In the second experiment, the stolon connections between ramets of G. hederacea clones growing in boxes were either left intact or severed soon after each ramet had rooted. After 10 weeks of growth, the total dry weight of the intact clones and the mean dry weight of their ramets were significantly greater than the corresponding values for severed clones. The spatial distribution of ramets showed marked differences between the treatments. Severed clones produced a greater number of rooted ramets within the boxes and a smaller number of unrooted ramets beyond the box edges than intact clones. Density of ramets more than doubled when stolons were severed. Maintenance of stolon connections in G. hederacea is advantageous because it improves the probability of daughter ramet survival, promotes rapid lateral expansion of the clone and reduces inter‐ramet competition through the production of fewer, larger ramets.",W1969150997,False,0.8101907968521118

We focus on Felsenstein's (1985) method and some variations of it and on several ""minimum evolution"" methods (of which the procedure of Huey and Bennett [1987] is a special case), as compared with a nonphylogenetic correlation. The last, a simple correlation of trait values across the tips of a phylogeny, virtually always yields inflated Type I error rates, relatively low power, and relatively poor estimates of evolutionary correlations. We therefore cannot recommend its use. In contrast, Felsenstein's (1985) method yields acceptable significance tests, high power, and good estimates of what we term the input correlation and the standardized realized evolutionary correlation, given complete phylogenetic information and knowledge of the rate and mode of character change (e.g., gradual and proportional to time [""Brownian motion""] or punctuational, with change only at speciation events). Inaccurate branch length information may affect any method adversely, but only rarely does it cause Felsenstein's (1985) method to perform worse than do the others tested. Other proposed methods generally yield inflated Type I error rates and have lower power. However, certain minimum evolution methods (although not the specific procedure used by Huey and Bennett [1987]) often provide more accurate estimates of what we term the unstandardized realized evolutionary correlation, and their use is recommended when estimation of this correlation is desired. We also demonstrate how correct Type I error rates can be obtained for any method by reference to an empirical null distribution derived from computer simulations, and provide practical suggestions on choosing an analytical method, based both on the evolutionary correlation of interest and on the availability of branch lengths and knowledge of the model of evolutionary change appropriate for the characters being analyzed. Computer programs that implement the various methods and that will simulate (correlated) character evolution along a known phylogeny are available from the authors on request. These programs can be used to test the effectiveness of any new methods that might be proposed, and to check the generality of our conclusions with regard to other phylogenies.",W1994977766,False,0.36223989725112915

Most regression, correlation, and contingency table methods, including nonparametric methods, assume that the points are drawn independently from a common distribution. When species are taken from a branching phylogeny, they are manifestly nonindependent. Use of a statistical method that assumes independence will cause overstatement of the significance in hypothesis tests. Some illustrative examples of these phenomena have been given, and limitations of previous proposals of ways to correct for the nonindependence have been discussed. A method of correcting for the phylogeny has been proposed. It requires that we know both the tree topology and the branch lengths, and that we be willing to allow the characters to be modeled by Brownian motion on a linear scale. Given these conditions, the phylogeny specifies a set of contrasts among species, contrasts that are statistically independent and can be used in regression or correlation studies.

The statement that the basal metabolism of animals differing in size is nearly proportional to their respective body surfaces, is called the surface law. Benedict has shown that this law is already over ninety years old, Robiquet and Tillaye having formulated it quite clearly in 1839. The history of the surface law is given in the paper of (Harris and Benedict (1919)). We may here only briefly mention the different ways in which it has been found. The early writers derived the law from theoretical considerations on a rather small experimental basis, as did Bergmann, who in 1847 had already written a book on the subject. Respiration trials were carried out by Regnault and Reiset, and Rameaux based the surface law on measurements of the amount of air respired per minute by two thousand human beings of different sizes. (Rubner (1883)) demonstrated the law in accurate respiration trials on dogs and Richet rediscovered it empirically on rabbits. The latter writes (p. 223): “C’est aprèe coup seulement que je me suis avisé que la donnée surface était plus intéressante que la donnée poids.” Although (Armsby, Fries, and Braman (1918), p. 55) found the surface law confirmed to a rather striking degree, this law is not at all so clear today as it appeared to its early discoverers. (Carman and Mitchell (1926), p. 380) state the situation very well: “In spite of the theoretical weakness of the surface law, the computation of basal metabolism to the unit of the body surface seems at present the most satisfactory method available of equalizing experimental results for differences in the size of experimental animals.”",W1970636319,False,0.16694582998752594

We evaluated the influence of light and biomass support costs on growth rates of trees 8–25 cm in diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) among 21 species differing in wood density in two aseasonal rain forests. Measurements of crown width, tree height, d.b.h. and wood density (ρ) were used to estimate the stem biomass ( M s ) of a standard‐sized tree (17 m tall and 16 m 2 in crown area), i.e. the cost in stem biomass of supporting a given sized crown at a given height. The species showed a three‐fold range in support cost, which was highly correlated with wood density ( M s ∝ ρ 0.77, r 2 = 0.72 for the log‐transformed relationship). This relationship is due to the high interspecific variation in wood density and the fact that the stem diameter of the standard‐sized tree increased only slightly with decreasing wood density, i.e. light‐wooded species did not compensate for their lighter, weaker wood by substantially increasing stem thickness. Mean growth rate per species showed a 10‐fold range and increased with the fraction of trees at least partly in gaps (gap fraction), the reciprocal of support cost (1/ M s ), and the reciprocal of wood density (1/ρ). The relationship between mean growth rate and 1/ M s was particularly strong when one outlier was excluded ( r 2 = 0.88) and among the Dipterocarpaceae ( r 2 = 0.89). Log(mortality rate), as determined for all trees per species ≥ 1 cm d.b.h., increased linearly with 1/ M s, 1/ρ and gap fraction. These results suggest an important role for wood density and support costs in the classic tradeoff between rapid growth and increased risks of damage and death.",W1553682677,False,0.7657284140586853

Adult size and development time are the outcomes of growth and differentiation throughout the life of an individual organism – its developmental trajectory. Correlations among ages and sizes across different life stages may influence both direct and indirect components of selection on body size and age during development. 2. We used two field studies in experimental gardens in fall and summer to evaluate phenotypic selection on size and age across larval, pupal and adult stages in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, and how this may vary across seasons. 3. Rapid larval development was positively associated with survival to pupation and adulthood, in part because it allowed escape from larval parasitoids. Larval mortality owing to parasitoids was greater in the fall than in the summer. Egg production was positively correlated with adult mass, but not with development time. 4. Principal component analyses of size and age throughout development showed that adult size and development time were not negatively correlated, contrary to life-history expectations. As a result, selection favouring larger adult size (via female reproduction) and selection favouring rapid larval development (via juvenile survival) do not act in opposition in this system. 5. We discuss the physiological mechanisms that may underlie the independence of adult size and early larval development for holometabolous insects, and the implications for selection on body size and developmental trajectories.",W1880873647,False,0.8229057788848877

Approaching these kinds of questions requires insights into the genetic architecture underlying a polymorphism and an understanding of the proximate mechanisms determining phenotype expression. Here we explore the genetic underpinnings and proximate factors influencing the expression of beetle horns – a dramatic sexually selected trait exhibiting intramale dimorphism in many species. Two relatively discrete male morphs are present in natural populations of the dung beetle Onthophagus taurus (Scarabaeidae, Onthophagini). Males exceeding a critical body size develop a pair of long, curved horns on their heads, while those smaller than this critical body size remain essentially hornless. We present results from laboratory breeding experiments designed to assess the relative importance of inherited and environmental factors as determinants of male morphology. Using father–son regressions, our findings demonstrate that horn length and body size of male progeny are not predicted from paternal morphology. Instead, natural variation in an environmental factor, the amount of food available to larvae, determined both the body sizes exhibited by males as adults and the presence or absence of horns. The nonlinear scaling relationship between the body size and horn length of males bred in the laboratory did not differ from the pattern of variation present in natural populations, suggesting that nutritional conditions account for variation in male morphology in natural populations as well. We discuss our results by extending ideas proposed to explain the evolution of conditional expression of alternative phenotypes in physically heterogeneous environments toward incorporating facultative expression of secondary sexual traits. We use this synthesis to begin characterizing the potential origin and subsequent evolution of facultative horn expression in onthophagine beetles.",W1972507051,False,0.6949452757835388

The evolution of mechanisms of inertia involves changes in the demographic functions, mediated through physiology or behavior, which keep the rate of numerical change low.

Understanding this so-called physiological time is of the utmost importance in explaining adaptations of insect life histories to resources that vary seasonally. This paper summarizes data on development rate for 54 species of insects and data on annual temperature regimes on an elevational and a latitudinal gradient. It then treats the curve representing temperature-dependent development as a filter of the temperature regimes during various seasons. The analysis points out several new evolutionary consequences of the position and shape of the development rate curve in relation to season and location. (1) If the criterion for maximizing fitness is fastest development accumulation, the optimal development curve can be specified. (2) In locations with high midsummer temperatures selection could favor different development curves in spring and summer and lead to polymorphism or species replacement in these seasons. (3) If the criterion is appropriate timing, some interesting possibilities emerge. (a) The importance of host-plant choice by a phytophageous insect may depend on season in locations with hot summers. (b) Development rate curves that appear to give equivalent timing at one season may actually lead to opposite responses to year-to-year changes in the temperature regime and to very different timings in different seasons. (c) Interactions between species which have temperature-dependent development rates may lead to coevolutionary changes in their respective development curves. (4) Selection along elevational and latitudinal gradients may lead to clinal variation in the development rate curve or to species replacement.",W1999003339,False,0.8364296555519104
https://doi.org/10.1186/jbiol43,A quantitative analysis of the mechanism that controls body size in Manduca sexta.,"Body size is controlled by mechanisms that terminate growth when the individual reaches a species-specific size. In insects, it is a pulse of ecdysone at the end of larval life that causes the larva to stop feeding and growing and initiate metamorphosis. Body size is a quantitative trait, so it is important that the problem of control of body size be analyzed quantitatively. The processes that control the timing of ecdysone secretion in larvae of the moth Manduca sexta are sufficiently well understood that they can be described in a rigorous manner.We develop a quantitative description of the empirical data on body size determination that accurately predicts body size for diverse genetic strains. We show that body size is fully determined by three fundamental parameters: the growth rate, the critical weight (which signals the initiation of juvenile hormone breakdown), and the interval between the critical weight and the secretion of ecdysone. All three parameters are easily measured and differ between genetic strains and environmental conditions. The mathematical description we develop can be used to explain how variables such as growth rate, nutrition, and temperature affect body size.Our analysis shows that there is no single locus of control of body size, but that body size is a system property that depends on interactions among the underlying determinants of the three fundamental parameters. A deeper mechanistic understanding of body size will be obtained by research aimed at uncovering the molecular mechanisms that give these three parameters their particular quantitative values.",W1596673971,False,0.24943386018276215

Poiché la profase maturativa si svolge in maniera normale, il raddoppiamento del numero dei cromosomi, che si compie in maniera non visibile, con tutta probabilità è da ritenere conseguenza di un processo di endomitosi che si realizza o negli ovogoni delle ultime generazioni ovogoniali, oppure negli ovociti all'inizio della profase maturativa.L'ovocita con 24 bivalenti emette due globuli polari e subisce una normale riduzione cromatica; l'uovo maturo pertanto contiene 24 cromosomi semplici ed entra in segmentazione con il solo corredo cromosomico materno senza la partecipazione del nucleo spermatico (ginogenesi).Il raddoppiamento endomitotico del numero dei cromosomi rende assai probabile l'appaiamento tra cromosomi gemelli. Tra i bivalenti diplotenici o metafasici non si vedono mai elementi multivalenti.B) Spermatogenesi - Le cellule spermatogoniali normalmente presentano 24 cromosomi; la spermatogenesi peraltro fondamentalmente si svolge secondo due linee spermatogene-tiche delle quali una presenta spermatociti metafasici con 24 bivalenti, oppure con bivalenti associati ad univalenti e multivalenti variamente ripartiti tra loro; l'altra invece presenta spermatociti metafasici con 12 bivalenti oppure con bivalenti associati ad univalenti e multivalenti. Gli spermatociti con soli bivalenti (rispettivamente 24 e 12 bivalenti) originano spermi funzionanti (rispettivamente a 4x e 2x) in seguito a processi spermatogenetici normali. Gli spermatociti con bivalenti, univalenti e multivalenti, subiscono invece processi spermatogenelici atipici caratterizzati essenzialmente da ineguale ripartizione di cromosomi. Tra i multivalenti sono più frequenti i trivalenti associati di regola con univalenti, più rari i quadrivalenti. L'aspetto dei multivalenti è quello consueto, descritto anche in altri organismi. La presenza di spermatociti con 24 bivalenti viene spiegata in maniera analoga a quella degli ovociti e cioè come conseguenza di un processo endomitotico che porta a 48 i 24 cromosomi degli spermatogoni; la presenza degli spermatociti a 12 bivalenti invece deve essere considerata come conseguenza di fenomeni di appaiamento normale dei 24 cromosomi iniziali. La formazione di multivalenti può essere spiegata in maniera plausibile ammettendo una condizione tetraploide ed octoploide dei corredi a 24 e rispettivamente 48 cromosomi.C) Poliploidia - Il riferimento ad un numero base n=6, già segnalato nel genere Polycelis, e la presenza di multivalenti negli spermatociti, sono dati che depongono in favore della condizione poliploide delle Polycelis nigra italiane. La formazione di 12 coppie di omologhi in una parte degli spermatociti, mentre non si concilia con l'ipotesi della triploidia del corredo a 24 cromosomi, viene spiegata in maniera soddisfacente qualora si consideri come tetraploide tale corredo. Di conseguenza il processo endomitotico, che porta da 24 a 48 il numero dei cromosomi negli ovociti ed in una parte degli spermatociti, determina la instaurazione di una condizione octoploide in tali elementi.D) Ciclo Cromosomico - Il ciclo cromosomico delle stirpi italiane di P. nigra è schematizzato nella fig. 9. Esso è fondamentalmente caratterizzato: a) da una condizione poliploide del corredo cromosomico con alternanza di uno stadio tetraploide, rappresentato dai 24 cromosomi delle cellule somatiche e dei goni degli esemplari adulti e di uno stadio octoploide, rappresentato dai 24 bivalenti degli ovociti e di una parte degli spermatociti; b) da processi ovogenetici normali; c) da processi spermatogenetici che si svolgono fondamentalmente secondo due linee diverse, rispettivamente a 24 e 12 bivalenti, ma con frequenti anomalie dovute alla presenza di univalenti e multivalenti nel corredo cromosomico; d) da sviluppo ginogenetico dell'uovo; e) da raddoppiamento endomitotico del corredo cromosomico in determinati momenti dello stadio pregametogenetico.SUMMARYThe Author studied the chromosome cycle of individuals of Polycelis nigra Ehrenberg coming from various Italian localities. The most important phenomena caracterizing such a cycle (polyploidy, endomitosis and gynogenesis) may be summarized as follows: A) Oogenesis - The oögonial cells possess normally 24 chromosomes; the oöcytes at diplotene and metaphase I show, on the contrary, 24 bivalents. Since the prophase of the first meiotic division occurs normally, it is inferred that a chromosome doubling of endomitotic type (not visible endomitosis) takes place either in the final generation of the oögonia or in the oöcytes just before the beginning of meiotic prophase.The oöcytes with 24 bivalents undergo a normal reduction division forming two polocytes. The matured egg, therefore possesses 24 single chromosomes (monochromosomes) and cleaves without the participation of the sperm nucleus, but under its activating effect (gynogenesis). The endomitotic doubling makes the pairing between twin-chromosomes very probable. Moreover, contrary to the behaviour seen at spermatogenesis (see below), no evidence of multivalents is noticed at oogenesis.B) Spermatogenesis - The spermatogonial cells normally show 24 chromosomes, but spermatogenesis follows two main lines. One of these is characterized by metaphase spermatocytes with either 24 bivalents or a various combination of bivalents, univalents and multivalents summing to 48 chromosomes. The second line shows, on the contrary, metaphase spermatocytes with either 12 bivalents or with a various combination of bivalents, univalents and multivalents (a total of 24 chromosomes). The spermatocytes with bivalents only (24 and 12 respectively) produce functional sperms (with 4x and 2x respectively) following normal spermatogenese processes. The spermatocytes with bivalents, univalents and multivalents undergo, on the contrary, atypical spermatogenetic processes, mainly characterized by unequal repartition of chromosomes. Among multivalents the most frequent are the trivalents, generally associated with univalents; quadrivalents are rarer than trivalents. The appearance cf the multivalents is that usual for other organisms.Also for the spermatocytes with 24 bivalents, an endomitotic chromosome doubling is assumed to occur before or just at the beginning of meiosis. The occurrence of spermatocytes with 12 bivalents is considered as a consequence of a normal pairing between the initial 24 chromosomes. A plausible explanation of multivalent formation is the tetraploid and octoploid condition of the 24 and 48 chromosome complements respectively.C) Polyploidy - The reference to a basic chromosome number n=6, already reported for the genus Polycelis, and the presence of multivalents in the spermatocytes, are evidence of the polyploid condition of the italian P. nigra populations. Since some 24 chromosome spermatocytes produce 12 homologues-pairs, the triploidy of such a complement is to be excluded, more probable being, therefore, a tetraploid condition. As a consequence, the endomitotic process, giving rise to 48 chromosomes in the oöcytes and some of the spermatocytes, fakes these elements octoploid.D) Chromosome Cycle - The main cytological events occurring in the chromosome cycle of the italian P. nigra populations have been schematically drawn in fig. 9.Apart from the description given above of the different processes characterizing such a cycle, additional observations refer to the cells of the embryos, as well as to the somatic and gonial cells of the adulte animals. All these cells were found to have normally 24 chromosomes; small variations in the chromosome number (from 23 to 27) being possible, but aot frequent.",W1586496053,False,0.02877764403820038

This chapter summarizes the major correlated life history features of idiobionts and koinobionts. The idiobiont/koinobiont spectrum is often used as a surrogate for whether a parasitoid of unknown biology is a generalist or specialist, because even though the biology of the individual species is likely to be unknown, whether or not a taxon is idio- or koinobiont or ectoor endoparasitoid, is almost always conserved at tribe level. There is a strong association between the idiobiont life history strategy, ectoparasitism and permanent host paralysis.

To illustrate the dynamics of this important but little studied form of coevolution, we have modeled an ongoing arms race between Drosophila melanogaster and the vertically transmitted sigma virus, using parameters we estimated in the field. We integrate these results with previous work showing that the spread of a resistance allele of the ref(2)P gene in the host was followed by the spread of a virus genotype, which overcomes this resistance. In line with these observations, our model predicts that there can be rapid selective sweeps in both the host and parasite, which can drive large changes in the prevalence of infection. The virus will tend to be ahead in the arms race, as incomplete dominance slows down host adaptation and selection for host resistance is weaker than selection for parasites to overcome resistance—the ""life-dinner"" principle. This asymmetry in the adaptation rates results in a partial sweep of the host resistance allele, as it loses its advantage part way through the selective sweep. This well-understood natural system illustrates how the outcome of host–parasite coevolution is determined by different population genetic parameters in the field.",W1945620467,False,0.14139170944690704

Leader RNA accumulated in Drosophila cell cytoplasm, but in low amounts, it was either free or associated to structures larger than the leader RNA-N protein complexes found in vertebrate cells. Only a few leader RNA copies migrated into the cell nucleus; no increase of this transport was observed at any time during the virus cycle. Viral RNAs complementary to the 3' end of the genome and ranging in size from the leader to several hundred nucleotides were found to accumulate in Drosophila cell cytoplasm. Their synthesis was inhibited in the presence of cycloheximide, which blocks all protein synthesis and VSV replication.

The specificity of host resistance and parasitoid virulence is thus a key factor in host‐parasitoid coevolution. A continuum of strategies exists, from strict specificity to a generalist strategy. The optimal level of specificity may differ in host and parasitoid. I investigated the optimal level of resistance specificity using a model in which the host could be attacked by two parasitoid species, with variable levels of defense specificity. The fitness of a parasitoid attacking two host species with different levels of virulence specificity was also modeled. Finally, a fluctuating environment was simulated by introducing variable probabilities of encounters between antagonistic species over several generations. If the frequency of encounters with the antagonistic species is fixed, then both host and parasitoid gain from a strategy of exclusive specialization toward the most frequent antagonist. If the frequency of encounters fluctuates between generations, generalist host resistance and partially specialist parasitoid virulence are favored. Generalist host resistance may be considered to be a bet‐hedging response to an unpredictable environment. This asymmetry in host‐parasitoid coevolution may account for some of the genetic structures observed in the field for host‐parasitoid associations.",W1989878719,False,0.8467576503753662

The resistance of a host and the virulence of a parasitoid determine which species survives after parasitism. Drosophila is parasitized by several hymenopterous parasitoids, especially those in the genera Asobara and Leptopilina. Geographic patterns have been found in parasitoid virulence and host resistance, the clearest of which is a cline in Asobara tabida virulence from the north (low) to the south (high) of Europe. Drosophila melanogaster resistance is highest in central‐southern Europe and lower elsewhere. We review and interpret these patterns in the light of recent experimental and theoretical studies of the evolution and coevolution of these traits. We find no evidence for genotype‐specific virulence and defense, which makes ""Red Queen""–type coevolution unlikely. The most important explanation for the patterns is geographic differences in host‐parasitoid community structure. Asobara tabida virulence is positively correlated with the resistance of its main hosts, and there is more limited evidence that D. melanogaster resistance is influenced by the virulence of its parasitoids. We critically appraise whether the evidence available so far supports a coevolutionary explanation for the levels of these traits.",W2022244702,False,0.7572242617607117

A particularly fertile area is the interaction between internal feeding parasitoids and their hosts. Hosts have evolved a variety of means of combating parasitoids, in particular cellular encapsulation, while parasitoids have evolved a wide range of countermeasures. Studies of the evolution of host resistance and parasitoid virulence are reviewed, with an emphasis on work involving Drosophila and its parasitoids. Genetic variation in both traits has been demonstrated using isofemale line and artificial selection techniques. Recent studies have investigated the fitness costs of maintaining the ability to resist parasitoids, the comparative fitness of flies that have successfully defended themselves against parasitoids, and the degree to which resistance and virulence act against one or more species of host or parasitoid. A number of studies have examined geographical patterns, and sought to look for local adaptation; or have compared the traits across a range of species. Finally, the physiological and genetic basis of change in resistance and virulence is being investigated. While concentrating on Drosophila, the limited amount of work on different systems is reviewed, and other possible areas of coevolution in host-parasitoid interactions are briefly discussed.",W2024151638,False,0.3393721878528595

The source of clones is important because present theory is based on an “all else equal” assumption, which is predicated on the idea that clonal mutants are derived from and compete with local sexual populations. Clonal diversity is important because it reduces the advantage of sexual reproduction under either soft selection (the Tangled Bank Hypothesis) or under strict frequency‐dependent selection (the Red Queen Hypothesis). In the present study, protein electrophoresis was used to determine the source and diversity of clones in a freshwater snail ( Potamopyrgus antipodarum ) in four glacial lakes in which sexual and clonal females were thought to coexist. The results showed (1) that the populations were mixtures of diploid sexual and triploid asexual individuals, (2) that genotypic diversity of clonal populations is very high in all four lakes (but lower than in the sympatric sexual populations), and (3) that the clones are polyphyletically derived from their sympatric sexual populations. Consequently, repeated mutation to parthenogenetic reproduction since the Pleistocene has introduced a different and diverse set of clones in all four lakes. Such diversity may provide a challenge for the ecological theories of sex that rely on frequency‐dependent selection.",W2011405340,False,0.8843565583229065

,Size-structured interactions and the dynamics of aquatic systems,"Size variation within species as a result of individual growth and development over the life cycle is a ubiquitous feature of many aquatic organisms. We review the implications of this size variation for the dynamics of aquatic systems. Ontogenetic development results in differences in size dependent competitive abilities between differently sized individuals giving rise to cohort cycles that are qualitatively different from traditional predator prey cycles. Size-dependent interactions also mean that the type of interaction - competitive or predatory - changes over the life cycle as a result of an increase in size. At the intraspecific level, cannibalistic interactions may, depending on the life history characteristics of the cannibal, give rise to either equilibrium or cycles driven by a mixture of inter-cohort cannibalism and competition. In multispecies contexts, size variation and particularly food dependent growth lead to the presence of alternative states involving catastrophic collapses. These size-structured interactions have so far been mainly demonstrated for fish and cladocerans, but do have whole lake food web ramifications.",W1551890515,False,0.8903297781944275

https://doi.org/10.1103/revmodphys.43.231,On the Volterra and Other Nonlinear Models of Interacting Populations,"A detailed investigation of various aspects of the populations of interacting biological species is made, using Volterra's and other models. For a system with two species, a detailed analysis is possible, and we plot the time variation of the population of two species for a set of values of the parameters. For a many-species system, it is shown that the time average of the population ${N}_{i}$ of the $i\mathrm{th}$ species is equal to its steady state value ${q}_{i}$. For time averages of other functions of ${N}_{i}$ and ${N}_{i}{N}_{j}$, only the equations satisfied by them are derived. The population growth of a species is studied by assuming that the effect of other species is to introduce a random function of time in the growth equation. The resulting Fokker-Planck equation is shown to have the same form as the Schr\""odinger and Bloch equations. The ""potential"" of the Schr\""odinger equation depends upon the form of the number-dependent term in the growth function. For the Gompertz form, it is a simple harmonic oscillator potential and, for the Verhulst form, the Morse potential. For both the forms, the Fokker-Planck equation is explicitly solved to obtain the probability distribution $P(N, t)$ of the population as a function of time. It is shown that considerable simplification is achieved in the calculation of the steady state concentrations (${q}_{i}'\mathrm{s}$) of the component species if Pfaffians are used. Since ${q}_{i}$ is equal to the time average of the population of the $i\mathrm{th}$ species, a great deal can be said about the stability of the population in the sense of the rarity of explosion or extinction of one or more species. If the interactions between various species and their growth coefficients (in the absence of interactions) are known, we show that a priori one can determine whether the population will be stable or not and, if not, which of the species will disappear. Also, the stability of the population is discussed when several new species are introduced. We show that the stability is dependent on how the newly introduced species interact with each other and with the population into which they are introduced. If the information about the detailed interactions between various species is absent, as is usually the case, then a statistical mechanical treatment of the population is desirable. We show that for small deviations from steady state populations, the necessary and sufficient condition for such a treatment is that the number of species is large. For arbitrary deviations the latter is a necessary condition and may not be sufficient. This statistical mechanical treatmetn provides an empirical method for calculating the interaction between two species and the stability of the population. A measure of the stability of an ecology is defined which could be used to compare the relative stabilities of two ecologies with the same macroscopic properties. The effect of changes in the interactions between var\'{\i}ous species, due to changes in temperature, humidity, age distribution, etc., is studied by assuming the rate constants to be random. A master equation for the probability distributions of ${N}_{i}'\mathrm{s}$ is derived. It is shown that the stationary population distribution is Poisson only if the variation in the rate constants is not too rapid. A brief outline of another stochastic model for the population growth in terms of the probabilities of birth and death of the individuals is given. Since the members of the population do not react instantaneously to any change in the environment, the prey-predator interaction does not affect the population of either prey or predator instantaneously, and the egg is not converted into an adult instantaneously, the effects of the time lags in the above processes on the behavior, in particular the stability, of the population are studied. Further generalizations of the Volterra model are discussed, and a brief review of other systems of interacting species, e.g., systems of biochemical oscillators, nervous systems, multimode lasers, systems of simultaneously growing bacteria, etc., is given. Finally, a sampling of the experiments which throw some light on the validity of Volterra's model and the statistical mechanical treatment is given.",W1979704006,False,0.823593020439148

The asymptotic approach to the steady state is proven to be exponential eventually. An estimate of the decay constant indicates faster convergence to the steady state the larger the size of the equilibrium populations, the intra-species interaction, and the ‘ nutritional value ’ of the inter-species interaction.",W1992856649,False,0.8553012609481812

This paper explores the use of a global theory called ""permanence"" that indicates whether the boundary of a phase space is a repellor to orbits in the phase space. The theory is used to try to identify, at a qualitative level, the states to which solutions tend in the phase space of an arbitrary pool of species. We define a ""permanent state"" of the pool as a subset of the species that is permanent in its own right and univadable by any other species from the pool. A simple assembly rule for communities that stems from this is that no permanent state can be a subset of another. Data on coexistence of drosophilid species and also on that of cuckoo doves, although incomplete, are consistent with this rule. A method is given for finding the permanent states of pools of species with Lotka—Volterra dynamics. Some properties of permanent states are illustrated by means of numerical examples from regional pools of species generated with Lotka—Volterra dynamics. These examples show three kinds of dynamics: a single permanent state, two or more alternative permanent state in which none are subsets of others, and an absence of any permanent states. The statistical distribution of these outcomes in pools of four and five species indicates that a single permanent state is the most likely one to occur, but that alternative states become more probable as the number of interactions among species increases. The implications of these results for understanding and modelling the process of succession driven by population dynamics are discussed.",W1966454265,False,0.409816175699234

https://doi.org/10.2307/1939496,"Costs and Benefits of Induced Resistance and Plant Density for a Native Shrub, Gossypium Thurberi","Many plants employ induced defenses that are activated after attack rather than constitutive defenses that are always present. Current theory predicts that one benefit of induced defenses is to optimize the plant's allocation to defense, growth, and reproduction. According to this reasoning induced defenses are expected under the following conditions: (1) Attack is unpredictable and not fatal. (2) Defense is costly; when herbivores are not present, the plant can save resources by not being defended and use them for growth and reproduction. (3) When herbivores are present, activation of the defense increases plant growth and reproduction. This study tested the allocation hypothesis by examining the effects of early—season damage to a desert shrub, Gossypium thurberi, in environments that either included or did not include its most abundant herbivore, Bucculatrix thurberiella. A companion paper demonstrated that induction occurred. Plants damaged early in the season supported fewer miners than controls that were not previously induced. If there was a benefit of induced resistance, I expected that survival, growth, and seed production would be greater for plants that had been induced experimentally by caterpillars early in the season compared to those that had not. I found no evidence that plants benefited by responding to damage early in the season, despite reductions in the populations of herbivores on damaged plants. If there were costs of induced resistance, I predicted that survival, growth, and seed production would be lower for induced plants than for controls when herbivores were excluded from both treatments. I found no evidence that induced resistance cost the plant anything in terms of survival, growth, or seed production. Finally, to determine if plant crowding was costly and if crowding interacted with induced resistance, survival, growth, and seed production were compared for plants that had no neighbors within 50 cm vs. those experiencing endemic densities of neighbors. Plants that experienced reduced density grew more and produced twice as many seeds as controls that experienced endemic densities of neighbors. No interactions between damage and plant density were observed. There are many different ways to interpret these negative results. I measured only a subset of the plant's lifetime fitness and the statistical power of my tests may have been insufficient. My experiment to test the benefits of induced resistance was much weaker than my tests of the costs of damage and of crowding. Herbivory may be unimportant in this system, although indirect evidence suggests otherwise. This and other empirical results suggest that the cost—benefit model may not be appropriate to explain the advantages of induced resistance over constitutive resistance. I discuss three alternative hypotheses to explain the existence of induced resistance.",W1989635410,False,0.4180586636066437

This decline in plant quality manifests itself by a highly significant reduction in rate of larval growth on a medium containing foliage from insect‐damaged as opposed to undamaged tomato plants. The induction of tomato Proteinase inhibitors, as a result of larval feeding, is invoked as a factor that systemically reduces leaf quality. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Pflanzenproteinaseinhibitoren: ein Abwehrmechanismus gegen herbivore Insekten? Eine zentrale Theorie in der Erforschung von Insekten‐Wirtspflanzen‐Wechselbeziehungen ist, dass sich bestimmte natürlich vorkommende Pflanzeninhaltsstoffe in Pflanzen zur Abwehr herbivorer Insekten und anderer Parasiten entwickelt haben. Zur Zeit herrschende überlegungen beinhalten auch das Konzept, dass herbivore Insekten das Potential besitzen, Veränderungen in der Abwehrund/oder Nahrungsqualitàt von Wirtspflanzen hervorzurufen, die den herbivoren Insekten schaden. Gegenwärtig is nur wenig über die Ursachen dieser von Insekten induzierten Veränderungen der Wirtspflanzenqualität bekannt. Jedoch werden häufig unterschiedliche Gehalte der Pflanzen an Phenolderivaten, Protein und/oder Proteinaseinhibitoren mit den Abwehrmechanismen in Zusammenhang gebracht. Diese Arbeit untersucht das Potential von Pflanzenproteinaseinhibitoren, als induzierbare Abwehr gegen herbivore Noctuidenlarven zu wirken. Tomatenpflanzen enthalten Proteinaseinhibitoren (PIs), die durch Verletzen der Pflanze induziert werden. Es besteht die Hypothese, dass diese Synthese von PIs einen Abwehrmechanismus gegen blattfressende Insekten darstellt. Diese Hypothese ist niemals angemessen in planta getestet worden und wird von uns anhand von Spodoptera exigua und Tomatenpflanzen, Lycopersicon esculentum, getestet. Weiterhin sollte festgestellt werden, ob eine Beziehung zwischen der PI‐Konzentration im Blatt und dem Wachstum von Blattmaterial fressenden Larven besteht. Anstelle lebender Pflanzen wurde dazu eine feste, Blattmaterial enthaltende Diat (15% gefriergetrocknetes Blattmaterial angemischt in Agarlösung und Sorbinsäure) benutzt, was die Verwending einer unverletzten Kontrolle ermöglichte. Diese künstliche Diat wurde S. exigua angeboten. Die Ergebnisse des Futterungsversuches (Fig. 2) zeigen, dass eine signifikante inverse Beziehung (r 2 = 0.81, p = 0.05) zwischen der PI‐Konzentration im Blattgewebe und den mittleren Gewichten von Larven von S. exigua besteht. Nicht dargestellt ist die nicht signifikante Korrelation zwischen mittlerem Gewicht der Larven und den Gehalten an Blattprotein (r 2 = 0.47, p &gt; 0.25) und Phenolderivaten (r 2 = 0.50, p = 0.25). Diese Ergebnisse veranlassen uns zu dem Ruckschluss, dass Tomatenproteinaseinhibitoren als systemisch induzierbare antibiotische chemische Abwehr gegen herbivore Insekten wie Noctuidenlarven anzusehen sind, und dass PIs einen Faktor darstellen, der zur systemischen Reduktion der Blattqualitat von Tomaten führt.",W2008828244,False,0.42237794399261475

https://doi.org/10.18174/206549,Biological control of two-spotted spider mites using phytoseiid predators,"The searching behaviour of individual predators of four phytoseiid species ( Phytoseiulus persimilis, Amblyseius p o tentillae, Amblyseius bibens, Metaseiulus occidentalis ) is investigated in relation to the two-spotted spider mite ( Tetranychus urticae ), which infests greenhouse roses. Especially the role of spider- mite webbing in the predator-prey relation is studied. Webbing interferes with searching, decreasing the rate of encounter per unit prey density. Low walking speeds and activity in webbing ensure that the predator is rarely disturbed after contact with other mites. Webbing also positively influences searching, as spider mites aggregate within the webbed area: prey density, defined here as the number of prey per square centimetre of webbed leaf area, is high, as is the rate of encounter with prey. The ability to capture a prey after tarsal contact depends on the food content of the gut, the prey-stage and, in two specific cases, the webbing; the success ratio of P. persimilis increased on a webbed substrate, that of A. potentillae decreased.Models to simulate rate of predation on the basis of the dynamics of the motivational state and the state dependent rate of successful encounter are proposed. The food content of the gut is chosen as an indicator of the motivational state. A stochastic queueing model simulates predation as accurately as a Monte Carlo model or a compound simulation model. The queueing model is preferred because of its economic use of computer time and the relatively few variables used. The model was validated in predation experiments.Systems analysis showed that the effect of temperature on the rate of predation is largely determined by its relation with the relative rate of food conversion into egg biomass and not by behavioural changes related to temperature. Also, it was shown that webbing has an important influence on the predation rate. A new model for the analysis of prey-stage preference is proposed.Predators invade the webbed leaf area after contact with the silk strands, irrespective of the presence of prey. The residence time in the prey colony is determined by prey density. Simulation of experimentally defined walking behaviour shows that predators remain in profitable prey patches by turning at the edge of the webbed leaf area. However, when predator density increases, the tendency to leave the prey colony also increases, even at high prey densities. Only A. potentillae avoided the webbed leaf area, preferring the thickest parts of the leaf ribs or other protected places on the plant.A survey of references on life history data is presented; emphasis is given to the role of food, temperature and relative humidity. Experiments by the author show that oviposition history of predatory females is a major factor in determining the actual rate of food conversion into egg biomass; and that the egg stage of the predators is very vulnerable to relative humidities below 70%, though the evapotranspiration of the plant and the hygroscopic properties of the webbing buffer this to some extent. As the juvenile mortality of the phytoseiids increases above 30°C, and that of the two-spotted spider mites above 35°C, spider-mite control at temperatures above 30°C is not effective.The four phytoseiid species are ranked on their capacities for numerical increase and predation: P. persimilis, A. bibens, M. occidentalis and A. potentillae. On capacity to survive on alternative foods they are ranked: A. potentillae, A. bibens, M. occidentalis and P. persimilis. Some trials with alternative food supply did not improve survival rates established for prevailing greenhouse conditions.The rate of increase of the webbed area per individual spider mite is quantified by experiment. This knowledge will enable continuous monitoring of the prey density during simulations of the predator-prey interactions on the population level.",W1518337477,False,0.7345092296600342

Understanding competition is therefore fundamental both to ecological insight and to conservation efforts. Fish are adaptable and tractable experimental organisms, offering excellent model systems for studies on competition, and they lend themselves to two approaches: (i) studies of short‐term competition, which quantify the components of behavioural interactions; (ii) studies of long‐term interactions, in which the indeterminate nature of fish growth makes it possible to measure rates directly and correlate them with competitive success. The nature and the intensity of competition vary according to resource characteristics and distributions in time and space, the ecological context, and the relative competitive abilities of the foragers. Second‐order effects, such as winner and loser consequences, add to the complexity and frustrated early attempts to develop realistic models of intraspecific competition. Recently, however, considerable advances have been made in both laboratory and field studies on fishes adding to our understanding of these interacting effects. At the same time, the application of individual‐based modelling offers the prospect of progress towards greater realism and accuracy in predicting competitive outcomes. This review draws together a wide and disparate literature on intraspecific competition in fishes to facilitate the work of both empiricists and theoreticians towards these important goals. In the short term, competing individuals may adopt different behavioural strategies and feeding patterns or establish dominance hierarchies and feeding territories. In the longer term, competition can drive character displacement and the formation of species pairs and fish provide some of the most compelling examples of these processes in evolutionary biology. The challenge for the future is to further develop our understanding of the relationship between the competitive environment and the responses of fishes, particularly with closer co‐operation between empiricists and theoreticians, and to apply this knowledge to aquaculture and to better management of exploited fish stocks.",W1969900518,False,0.7667788863182068

The fitness consequences of such life-history variation are most readily studied in organisms that reproduce only once in their lifetime. The timing of the onset of reproduction (bolting) in the monocarpic perennial, Lobelia inflata, occurs over a range of dates within a season, and may be postponed to a later year. Empirical relationships among life-history traits, derived from over 950 wild-growing and experimentally manipulated plants in the field, are used to model an optimal changing size threshold (norm of reaction) for bolting over the growing season. Comparisons are made between observed and expected norms of reaction governing bolting. An apparently suboptimal bolting schedule that precludes bolting beyond an early (conservative) date is observed, and is found to be qualitatively consistent with conservative bet hedging under unpredictable season lengths. On this basis we propose the schedule of bolting as a plausible example of a conservative bet-hedging strategy.

These two strains provide an excellent opportunity to study the effects of Mhc class I polymorphism on the T cell repertoire. We recently discovered a gain in the antiviral CTL repertoire in bm8 mice as a consequence of the emergence of the Mhc class I allele H-2Kbm8. In this report we sought to determine the mechanism behind the generation of this increased CTL diversity. Our results demonstrate that repertoire diversification occurred by a gain in intrathymic positive selection. As previously shown, the emergence of the same Mhc allele also caused a loss in positive selection of T cell repertoire specific for another Ag, OVA-8. This indicates that a reciprocal loss-and-gain pattern of intrathymic selection exists between H-2Kb and H-2Kbm8. Therefore, in the thymus of an individual, a new Mhc allele can select new T cell specificities, while abandoning some T cell specificities selected by the wild-type allele. A byproduct of this repertoire shift is a net gain of T cell repertoire of the species, which is likely to improve its survival fitness.",W1758442221,False,0.04743225872516632

Incidence of caudal fin damage (used as an indirect assessment of aggressive interactions) was high amongst the wild-caught charr, and there was considerable mortality amongst these fish. By contrast, hatchery-reared fish displayed little evidence of fin damage, and mortalities were low. When the charr were held in mixed groups of wild-caught and hatchery-reared fish, the hatchery-reared fish showed the most extensive caudal fin damage. Weight losses and decreases in condition were also greatest amongst the hatchery-reared charr that were exposed to competition with wild fish. The hatchery-reared charr held together with the wild fish also suffered high mortality. Thus, aggression may have been selectively directed towards hatchery-reared fish in mixed groups.

https://doi.org/10.2307/2937180,Competition Among Grasses Along a Nitrogen Gradient: Initial Conditions and Mechanisms of Competition,"We grew four perennial grass species (Poa pratensis, Agropyron repens, Agrostis scabra, and Schizachyrium scoparium) for 5 yr in monocultures and in pairwise competition plots on an experimental nitrogen gradient. The gradient contained plots ranging from 100% sand to 100% black soil, plus plots that received additional N fertilizer. To examine the impact of initial conditions on the long—term outcome of interspecific competition, three competitive situations were created: seed vs. seed competition (both species planned simultaneously), seed invasions (each species added as seed to year—old monocultures of the other), and vegetative invasions (dividers separating adjacent monocultures of two species removed after 1 yr). Extractable soil NO 3 — and NH 4 + were measured to test if species differences in the concentration of available soil N in monoculture (i.e., R* for N, Tilman 1982) could predict the long—term outcome of competition. By year 5, Schizachyrium displaced or greatly reduced the biomass of both Poa and Agropyron on the soil mixture gradient (the mixed soils but not the added—N plots) independent of the wide range of starting conditions. On these soils, Schizachyrium monocultures had significantly lower soil concentrations of both NO 3 — and NH 4 + than either Poa or Agropyron monocultures. Similarly, Agropyron displaced or greatly reduced the biomass of Agrostis by year 5. Agropyron monocultures had significantly lower concentrations of NO 3 — and NO 3 — + NH 4 +, but not NH 4 +, than Agrostis monocultures. In contrast, no competitive displacement occurred in competition between Poa and Agropyron, and initial differences persisted over 5 yr. Monocultures of these two species did not differ in NO 3 — concentration, but did differ for NH 4 + and NO 3 — + NH 4 +. Thus, species differences in ability to deplete soil NO 3 — successfully predicted the outcome of competition for all four species pairs on the soil mixture gradient. If resource preemption or asymmetric competition had been the mechanism of competition, initial conditions would have affected the long—term outcome of competition. Rather, these results support the R* (i.e., resource reduction) model for competition for soil N. In the added—N fertilizer plots, Schizachyrium had decreased biomass in competition with both Poa and Agropyron. However, neither Agropyron nor Poa appeared to have an advantage when they competed with each other in the added—N plots. For these three species pairs, the 5—yr results of competition in the added—N plots, which had greatly reduced light availability because of increased production and litter accumulation, depended on initial conditions. In the fourth pair, Agrostis was displaced by Agropyron in all competition treatments in the added—N plots. Thus, we cannot reject the hypothesis that resource preemption (i.e., asymmetric competition) is important in light competition.",W1991142451,False,0.22735388576984406

An anthropomorphic description is difficult to resist. The ants are efficient and industrious farmers. Their single crop is a fungus, grown on a substrate of leaves in carefully fertilized, welltended gardens. Virtually every facet of the ants' behavior and life cycle has been shaped by their association with the fungus they culture. A characteristic feature of the ants' gardening technique is the application of their fecal material to the garden and to substrate being prepared for incorporation into the garden. We have established the biochemical significance of this behavior. The fecal material contains proteolytic enzymes which compensate for a deficiency of such enzymes in the fungus. In addition, the nitrogenous components in the fecal material facilitate the initial growth of the fungus. In biochemical terms, then, one can say that the ants contribute their enzymatic apparatus to degrade protein and the fungus contributes its enzymatic apparatus to degrade cellulose. As in the case of so many other natural symbiotic and parasitic associations, the basis is an integration of complementary metabolic capabilities and deficiencies.",W1679932853,False,0.5136101245880127

This probability depends upon the level of polymorphisms at the time of speciation and is generally quite high unless the two speciation events are far apart in time. If phylogenetic data from multiple loci are available, a likelihood ratio test can be used to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the best phylogeny. The appropriate null hypothesis is either a trichotomy or an alternative phylogeny, depending on the data set. The likelihood ratios required for accepting the best phylogeny are given. These ratios are obtained by exact enumeration when the number of loci is small (n less than 15) and by an asymptotic approach for larger n's.

We describe a novel approach that uses the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for rapid simplified restriction typing and mapping of DNA from many different isolates. DNA fragments up to 2 kilobase pairs in length were efficiently amplified from crude DNA samples of several pathogenic Cryptococcus species, including C. neoformans, C. albidus, C. laurentii, and C. uniguttulatus. Digestion and electrophoresis of the PCR products by using frequent-cutting restriction enzymes produced complex restriction phenotypes (fingerprints) that were often unique for each strain or species. We used the PCR to amplify and analyze restriction pattern variation within three major portions of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats from these fungi. Detailed mapping of many restriction sites within the rDNA locus was determined by fingerprint analysis of progressively larger PCR fragments sharing a common primer site at one end. As judged by PCR fingerprints, the rDNA of 19 C. neoformans isolates showed no variation for four restriction enzymes that we surveyed. Other Cryptococcus spp. showed varying levels of restriction pattern variation within their rDNAs and were shown to be genetically distinct from C. neoformans. The PCR primers used in this study have also been successfully applied for amplification of rDNAs from other pathogenic and nonpathogenic fungi, including Candida spp., and ought to have wide applicability for clinical detection and other studies.",W1883639496,False,0.00921985786408186

Some of the classes appeared to be heterozygous at the rDNA locus. Similar digestion of other Candida species showed that each could be identified on the basis of its restriction patterns.

A phylogenetically informative event in a gene tree constructed from nucleotide differences consists of interspecific coalescences of genes in each of which two genes sampled from different populations are descended from a common ancestor. The consistency probability between gene and population trees in which they are topologically identical was formulated in terms of interspecific coalescences. It was found that the consistency probability thus derived substantially increases as the sample size of genes increases, unless the divergence time of populations is very long compared to population sizes. Hence, there are cases where large samples at a locus are very useful in inferring a population tree.",W1929783548,False,0.17707866430282593

Such equations almost always exist for mammals and birds, often for other vertebrates and invertebrates, sometimes for protozoa, algae, and bacteria, and occasionally even for plants. There are too many organisms to measure all aspects of the biology of every species of population, so scientists must depend on generalizations.

Herbivory by one phytophagous species has the potential to affect other herbivores exploiting the same plant, hence plants are able to mediate indirect interactions between organisms that exploit them, even if these organisms are spatially or temporally separated (Masters and Brown 1997). For example, root-feeding herbivores may impact on the performance of foliar feeding insects (Gange and Brown 1989, Masters and Brown 1992), while herbivores feeding early in the season affect the growth and development of those feeding later (West 1985, Harrison and Karban 1986). Many such interactions are mediated by damage-induced changes in the chemical composition of the shared host plant (Hartley and Jones 1997, Karban and Baldwin 1997), particularly increases in secondary compounds (Hartley and Lawton 1987, Haukioja et al. 1990), but there are also cases where alterations in the nutrient levels within the host explain the impact of one insect herbivore on another (McClure 1980, Denno et al. 2000). Thus both changes in nutrient and in secondary compounds have been associated with detrimental effects on other phytophagous insects and may underpin competitive indirect interactions between herbivores (Denno et al. 1995).",W1604103548,False,0.6976428031921387

H owever, these decreases in photosynthesis were not asso-ciated with changes in the amounts of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carb oxylase (Rubisco) and other several photo-synthetic components, but were associated with an increase in starch content. In addition, such a decrease in the photosynthetic rate was not observed when measured with O2 evolution under conditions of saturating CO2. Similarly, although a decrease in CO2-limited photosynthesis for a given Rubisco content was found in depodded plants, neither the speci fic activity nor activation state of Rubisco decreased. The decrease in the photosynthetic gas-exchange rate by pod removal was rec overed by shading the plants. CO2-limited photosynthesis per unit of Rubisco protein was also completely recovered at the same l evel in the plants with pods. At the same time, starch accumu-lation was also decreased by shading.

The effects of plant architecture on the Lepidoptera assemblage associated with heather Calluna vulgaris were studied at four locations in northern England and southern Scotland in 1992 and 1993. The study areas were Calluna vulgaris – Vaccinium myrtillus heaths, where management by rotational burning had created a mosaic of stands of different‐aged Calluna. Lepidoptera were sampled in the larval stage. 2. Larval abundance was considered in relation to Calluna age, height, cover, green shoot density, and flower density. For most study areas and species, multiple regression selected Calluna height as the variable that explained most variation in larval density, although the explanatory variables were intercorrelated. 3. After compensating for the effects of different study locations, the slope of the regression between the logarithm of larval density and the logarithm of Calluna height was common to the macrolepidoptera, microlepidoptera, geometrid, and noctuid larval groups. 4. There was a significant progressive increase in larval diversity with increase in Calluna height, due to the presence of uncommon moth species in the samples from taller Calluna, and a change in the contribution of common species to the community in different height zones. 5. The significance of these results is discussed in relation to other heathland invertebrate studies and management practices.",W1984266186,False,0.8509129881858826

The efficacy of acoustic signals can depend on many factors, including the transmitter, the receiver, and the signalling environment. In the present study, we evaluate the effect of body size and habitat on the evolution of learned vocal displays across the tanagers (Aves: Thraupidae), a group that comprises nearly 10% of all songbird species. We find that body size affects tanager vocalizations, such that nine out of ten song characters and scores from two principal component axes were correlated with mass. More specifically, larger tanagers tended to produce slower-paced, lower-pitched vocal displays within narrower bandwidths. In contrast, habitat was correlated with only three out of ten song characters, and only one of these characters corroborated the directional predictions of the acoustic adaptation hypothesis. Thus, morphological characters, such as body mass, may play a more important role than variation among signalling environments in the evolution of avian vocal displays.",W1523802035,False,0.8547388911247253

In order to revise the latter and to identify new characters of phylogenetic significance, skeletons of most charadriiform family-level taxa were examined and 49 characters analysed. Tree topology was sensitive to outgroup choice, but the result of the analysis rooted with Columbidae (doves and pigeons) recovered a monophyletic Scolopaci, Charadrii, and nonturnicid Lari. With regard to the inclusion of Alcidae and Glareolidae in the Lari, the results of the present study are also in better concordance with the new molecular phylogenies than previous analyses of morphological data. Furthermore, for the first time an apomorphy of a clade including Thinocoridae, Pedionomidae, Rostratulidae, and Jacanidae was identified. Inclusion of Turnicidae in the Lari could not be supported, but there is no strong morphological evidence for an alternative placement. Pluvianus shares derived osteological features with the Burhinidae, and its position in the molecular analyses likewise cannot be corroborated with morphological data. Based on the topology of the molecular consensus tree, the ancestral state of selected characters is reconstructed.

Character compatibility analysis (described herein) was used to determine the largest sets of mutually compatible characters in the data set. Largest sets of mutually compatible characters were chosen as the best estimators of the phylogenetic history of the order. Smaller and smaller monophyletic groups (as identified by previous analysis of the next larger monophyletic group) were analysed to find locally largest sets of mutually compatible characters until the cladistic information in the data set was exhausted. The results of these analyses indicate that the Charadriiformes consist of three phyletic lines (here treated as suborders): the Scolopaci, the Charadrii and the Alcae. The Scolopaci consist of the birds usually included in the families Jacanidae, Rostratulidae, Scolopacidae, Phalaropodidae and Thinocoridae. The Charadrii consist of two major phyletic branches: one leading to the Lari and the other to the line discussed below.

https://doi.org/10.1017/s0094837300012926,Volatility and the Phanerozoic decline of background extinction intensity,"The well-known decline of global background extinction intensity was caused by the sorting of higher taxonomic groups. Two factors were responsible. First, probabilities of familial origination and extinction in these groups (taxonomic orders) were highly correlated. Groups whose families had high probabilities of origination and extinction tended to have highly volatile diversity paths and, consequently, short life spans. Second, orders with high probabilities of familial origination and extinction were rarely replaced by new high-turnover orders. Thus, because high-turnover orders tended to become extinct without replacement, the global background extinction intensity declined. Since familial origination and extinction probabilities are correlated, global background origination intensity inevitably declined as well. As a consequence of these processes, virtually all groups of organisms now living have low probabilities of familial origination and extinction. Simulations of branching evolution were used to obtain the expected relationships among probabilities (of origination and extinction), volatilities, and longevities for the entire range of possible probabilities, and these relationships were compared to those obtained from the empirical record. In the simulations, only the probabilities of origination and extinction were specified, so volatilities and clade longevities were determined entirely by the probabilities. The similarity between results obtained by simulation and those obtained by analysis of the empirical record further supports the inference that the observed decline of background extinction (and origination) intensity can be explained largely by the loss of high-probability groups to induced volatility.",W1590137183,False,0.8466492295265198

,THE EARLY EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF BIRDS,"With more than 10,000 species-roughly twice as many as there are mammals or lizards-birds are by far the most diverse group of living land vertebrates. However, this enormous diversity is just a remnant of an ancient evolutionary radiation that can be traced back to the Jurassic, to the 150 million-year-old Archaeopteryx from southern Germany. Research on the early history of birds and the development of flight has been at the forefront of paleontology since the advent of evolutionary thought. For most of this time, however, the available evidence was limited to a small number of fossils largely restricted to near-shore and marine environments, and greatly separated both anatomically and in time. A burst of discoveries of Cretaceous birds over the last two decades has revealed a hitherto unexpected diversity; since the early 1990s, the number of new species described has more than tripled those known for much of the last two centuries. This rapid increase in discoveries has not only filled much of the anatomical and temporal gaps that existed previously, but has also made the study of early birds one of the most dynamic fields of vertebrate paleontology.",W1513251836,False,0.00231502135284245

The popular consensus is that female ornaments are subject to the same modes of sexual selection as males: intrasexual competition and mate choice. However, it remains unclear how these forces interact within and between sexes, or whether they fully capture selection on female traits. One possibility is that the 'armament–ornament' model – which proposes that traits used primarily in male-male contests are also co-opted by females as indicators of male quality – can be extended to explain signal evolution in both sexes. We examine this idea by testing the function of acoustic signals in two species of duetting antbirds. Behavioural observations and playback experiments suggest that male and female songs function primarily as armaments in competitive interactions. Removal experiments reveal that song is also a classic ornament used by unpaired males and females to advertise for mates. These results indicate that 'armament–ornament' processes may operate in reciprocal format, potentially explaining widespread mutual ornamentation in species with elevated intrasexual competition for resources. In addition, given that songs mediate competition between species outside the breeding season, our findings suggest that processes shaping monomorphic ornaments extend beyond the traditional definitions of sexual selection and are best understood in the broader framework of social selection.",W1500382375,False,0.6024336814880371

We investigated this possibility by synchronously measuring the acoustic frequency and amplitude and the kinematics (beak gape and head angle) of singing behavior in the white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis) and the swamp sparrow (Melospiza georgiana). These birds are closely related emberizine sparrows, but their songs differ radically in frequency and amplitude structure. We found that the acoustic frequencies of notes in a song have a consistent, positive correlation with beak gape in both species. Beak gape increased significantly with increasing frequency during the first two notes in Z. albicollis song, with a mean frequency for note 1 of 3kHz corresponding to a gape of 0.4cm (a 15° gape angle) and a mean frequency for note 2 of 4kHz corresponding to a gape of 0.7cm (a 30° gape angle). The relationship between gape and frequency for the upswept third note in Z. albicollis also was significant. In M. georgiana, low frequencies of 3kHz corresponded to beak gapes of 0.2–0.3 cm (a 10–15° beak angle), whereas frequencies of 7–8kHz were associated with flaring of the beak to over 1cm (a beak angle greater than 50°). Beak gape and song amplitude are poorly correlated in both species. We conclude that cranial kinematics, particularly beak movements, influence the resonance properties of the vocal tract by varying its physical dimensions and thus play an active role in the production of birdsong.",W1899169209,False,0.019970960915088654
,EFFECT OF MATE REMOVAL ON SINGING BEHAVIOR AND MOVEMENT PATTERNS OF FEMALE NORTHERN CARDINALS,"ABSTRACr.-We temporarily removed the mates of four female Northern Cardinals (Car- dinalis cardinalis) during the pre-nesting period in an attempt to clarify the functions of singing by females. Mate removal had no significant effect on singing rates, number of movements per hour, or distance moved per hour. The failure to increase singing rates after mate removal suggests that singing by female cardinals is not used to attract new mates and the absence of any change in movement patterns suggests that females may not actively seek new mates. When singing, female cardinals were usually accompanied by a singing male and, prior to and after mate removal, females often duetted with their mates. Female cardinals may sing and duet with mates to advertise the presence of a female and the mated status of a male. Duetting may also permit pairs to learn each other's songs.

In the present short article we will describe a new Bayesian method for fitting evolutionary models to comparative data that incorporates intraspecific variability. This method differs from an existing likelihood-based approach in that it requires no a priori inference about species means and variances; rather it takes phenotypic values from individuals and a phylogenetic tree as input, and then samples species means and variances, along with the parameters of the evolutionary model, from their joint posterior probability distribution. One of the most novel and intriguing attributes of this approach is that jointly sampling the species means with the evolutionary model parameters means that the model and tree can influence our estimates of species mean trait values, not just the reverse. In the present implementation, we first apply this method to the most widely used evolutionary model for continuously valued phenotypic trait data (Brownian motion). However, the general approach has broad applicability, which we illustrate by also fitting the λ model, another simple model for quantitative trait evolution on a phylogeny. We test our approach via simulation and by analyzing two empirical datasets obtained from the literature. Finally, we have implemented the methods described herein in a new function for the R statistical computing environment, and this function will be distributed as part of the 'phytools' R library.",W1498441431,False,0.01654926687479019

The evolutionary modes commonly included in PCMs are Brownian motion (genetic drift) and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (stabilizing selection), whose likelihood functions are mathematically tractable. More complicated models of evolutionary modes, such as branch-specific directional selection, have not been used because calculations of likelihood and parameter estimates in the maximum-likelihood framework are not straightforward. To solve this problem, we introduced a population genetics framework into a PCM, and here, we present a flexible and comprehensive framework for estimating evolutionary parameters through simulation-based likelihood computations. The method does not require analytic likelihood computations, and evolutionary models can be used as long as simulation is possible. Our approach has many advantages: it incorporates different evolutionary modes for phenotypes into phylogeny, it takes intraspecific variation into account, it evaluates full likelihood instead of using summary statistics, and it can be used to estimate ancestral traits. We present a successful application of the method to the evolution of brain size in primates. Our method can be easily implemented in more computationally effective frameworks such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), which will enhance the use of computationally intensive methods in the study of phenotypic evolution.",W1541761473,False,0.0008160161087289453

However, most methods have limited utility at broad phylogenetic scales because they typically require complete sampling of both the tree and the associated phenotypic data. Here, we develop and implement a new, tree-based method called MECCA (Modeling Evolution of Continuous Characters using ABC) that uses a hybrid likelihood/approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)-Markov-Chain Monte Carlo approach to simultaneously infer rates of diversification and trait evolution from incompletely sampled phylogenies and trait data. We demonstrate via simulation that MECCA has considerable power to choose among single versus multiple evolutionary rate models, and thus can be used to test hypotheses about changes in the rate of trait evolution across an incomplete tree of life. We finally apply MECCA to an empirical example of body size evolution in carnivores, and show that there is no evidence for an elevated rate of body size evolution in the pinnipeds relative to terrestrial carnivores.

According to this method, we propose no specific prior hypothesis for how the variation in evolutionary rate is structured throughout the history of the species in our study. Instead, we use a bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to estimate evolutionary rates and the shift point between rates on the tree. We do this by simultaneously sampling rates and shift points in proportion to their posterior probability, and then collapsing the posterior sample into an estimate of the parameters of interest. We use simulation to show that the method is quite successful at identifying the phylogenetic position of a shift in the rate of evolution, and that estimated rates are asymptotically unbiased.

As a result of competition for the limited space within the body, investment in adjacent structures could represent an evolutionary compromise. For example, evolutionary trade-offs resulting from limited space in the head could have influenced how the sizes of the jaw muscle, as well as the eyes, evolved in North American cyprinid fishes. To test the evolutionary independence of the size of these structures, we measured the mass of the three major adductor mandibulae muscles and determined the eye volume in 36 cyprinid species. Using a novel phylogeny, we tested the hypotheses that the sizes of these four structures were negatively correlated with each other during cyprinid evolution. We found that evolutionary change in the adductor mandibulae muscles was generally positively and/or not correlated, suggesting that competition for space among cyprinid jaw muscles has not influenced their evolution. However, there was a negative relationship between mass of adductor mandibulae 1 and eye volume, indicating that change in these physically adjacent structures is consistent with an evolutionary constructional constraint.",W1545788027,False,0.6749778389930725
,CODA: convergence diagnosis and output analysis for MCMC,"[1st paragraph] At first sight, Bayesian inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) appears to be straightforward. The user defines a full probability model, perhaps using one of the programs discussed in this issue; an underlying sampling engine takes the model definition and returns a sequence of dependent samples from the posterior distribution of the model parameters, given the supplied data. The user can derive any summary of the posterior distribution from this sample. For example, to calculate a 95% credible interval for a parameter α, it suffices to take 1000 MCMC iterations of α and sort them so that α1<α2<...<α1000. The credible interval estimate is then (α25, α975). However, there is a price to be paid for this simplicity. Unlike most numerical methods used in statistical inference, MCMC does not give a clear indication of whether it has converged. The underlying Markov chain theory only guarantees that the distribution of the output will converge to the posterior in the limit as the number of iterations increases to infinity. The user is generally ignorant about how quickly convergence occurs, and therefore has to fall back on post hoc testing of the sampled output. By convention, the sample is divided into two parts: a “burn in” period during which all samples are discarded, and the remainder of the run in which the chain is considered to have converged sufficiently close to the limiting distribution to be used. Two questions then arise: 1. How long should the burn in period be? 2. How many samples are required to accurately estimate posterior quantities of interest? The coda package for R contains a set of functions designed to help the user answer these questions. Some of these convergence diagnostics are simple graphical ways of summarizing the data. Others are formal statistical tests.",W1549853756,False,0.05275307595729828

Population genetic studies have reported the existence of both outcrossing and selfing populations in Arabis alpina (Brassicaceae), which is an emerging model species for studying the molecular basis of perenniality and local adaptation. It is unknown whether its selfing populations have evolved a selfing syndrome. Methods Using macro-photography, microscopy and automated cell counting, we compared floral syndromes (size, herkogamy, pollen and ovule numbers) between three outcrossing populations from the Apuan Alps and three selfing populations from the Western and Central Alps (Maritime Alps and Dolomites). In addition, we genotyped the plants for 12 microsatellite loci to confirm previous measures of diversity and inbreeding coefficients based on allozymes, and performed Bayesian clustering. Results and Discussion Plants from the three selfing populations had markedly smaller flowers, less herkogamy and lower pollen production than plants from the three outcrossing populations, whereas pistil length and ovule number have remained constant. Compared to allozymes, microsatellite variation was higher, but revealed similar patterns of low diversity and high Fis in selfing populations. Bayesian clustering revealed two clusters. The first cluster contained the three outcrossing populations from the Apuan Alps, the second contained the three selfing populations from the Maritime Alps and Dolomites. Conclusion We conclude that in comparison to three outcrossing populations, three populations with high selfing rates are characterised by a flower morphology that is closer to the selfing syndrome. The presence of outcrossing and selfing floral syndromes within a single species will facilitate unravelling the genetic basis of the selfing syndrome, and addressing which selective forces drive its evolution.",W1569496099,False,0.4753700792789459

We inferred the genetic basis of mating system differences between the outbreeding Mimulus guttatus and the inbreeding M. platycalyx by quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping using random amplified polymorphic DNA and isozyme markers. One to three QTL were detected for each of five mating system characters, and each QTL explained 7.6–28.6% of the phenotypic variance. Taken together, QTL accounted for up to 38% of the variation in mating system characters, and a large proportion of variation was unaccounted for. Inferred QTL often affected more than one trait, contributing to the genetic correlation between those traits. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that quantitative variation in plant mating system characters is primarily controlled by loci with small effect.",W1928332458,False,0.003489613998681307

The self-incompatibility locus, S, on chromosome 1 harbored the only QTL for self-incompatibility indicating that the transition to self-compatibility in the lineage leading to the cultivated tomato was primarily the result of mutations at the S locus. Moreover, the major QTL controlling unilateral incongruity also mapped to the S locus, supporting the hypothesis that self-incompatibility and unilateral incongruity are not independent mechanisms. The mating behavior of near-isogenic lines carrying the L. hirsutum allele for the S locus on chromosome 1 in an otherwise L. esculentum background support these conclusions. The S locus region of chromosome 1 also harbors most major QTL for several floral traits important to pollination biology (e.g., number and size of flowers), suggesting a gene complex controlling both genetic and morphological mechanisms of reproduction control.

(Saxifragaceae): molecular evidence for glacial relict endemism in central Europe,"Saxifraga paniculata Mill. is an amphi-atlantic species that is widely distributed in the Alps but also occurs with disjunct populations in central Europe. These isolated populations are considered to be glacial relicts. In the study presented here, we analysed the genetic variation within and between populations of Saxifraga paniculata in central Europe to test whether the molecular data give evidence for the supposed relict endemism. We used RAPD analysis and the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) technique to investigate 30 populations of Saxifraga paniculata from different locations in central Europe and adjacent geographical areas. In the RAPD analysis, 319 fragments could be amplified of which 91.2% were polymorphic. The percentage of polymorphic bands within populations correlated significantly with population size, indicating a higher level of inbreeding in small populations. AMOVA revealed 43.60% of the variation within populations, only 15.45% between populations within locations, and 40.95% between locations. Genetic distance between locations (ΦST) correlated significantly with the geographical distance between locations, giving evidence for geographical isolation. In an UPGMA cluster analysis, based on RAPD data, the populations were grouped together according to their location. The results exhibit a strong genetic differentiation which is obviously due to genetic drift in the isolated populations. Our study therefore gives evidence for glacial relict endemism of Saxifraga paniculata in central Europe.",W1904798322,False,0.8067876696586609

Evidence for the operation of such a mechanism is rare in this context, however. Here, I report an experiment that used oil-seed rape (Brassica napus cv. Westar) as the basis of a model system in which the spatial disposition of flowers' sexual organs was manipulated in order to characterize the relationship between form and function. Specifically, individual flowers were manipulated by replacing a section of the style with a length of fine wire in order to produce flowers with pistils of various lengths. The pollination performance of these virgin, model flowers was then assessed by measuring the amount of pollen removed and deposited during a single bumblebee visit. There was no evidence that pollen removal was affected by pistil length. Variation in pistil length, however, was associated with a pronounced optimum in pollen deposition, which was attained by only a narrow range of pistil variants of intermediate length.

Because the proportion deposited declined as the amount removed increased, an individual plant would maximize its total pollen dispersal by relying on many pollen-removing visits while limiting the pollen removed by each pollinator. This restriction of pollen removal could be achieved by a plant presenting only a small portion of its pollen at one time (packaging) and/or by limiting the amount of presented pollen that a pollinator removes during a single visit (dispensing). The restriction of pollen removal required to maximize the expected total deposition on stigmas depends on the number of pollinator visits a plant receives, variation in the frequency of visits, and the pattern of pollen removal during a series of visits. Many aspects of floral biology contribute to a plant's ability to restrict pollen removal, including inflorescence size, flower morphology, anthesis patterns, nectar production, and dichogamy. Selection increasing paternal fitness of animal-pollinated plants could therefore elicit one of a variety of evolutionary responses; the specific response will depend on characteristics of both the plant and the pollinator.",W1975184934,False,0.5149783492088318

Fruit set in this hummingbird‐pollinated plant averaged 4.9 to 40.3% across the 4 years of study. Both the total amount of pollen donated and the total amount received, as estimated by movement of fluorescent powdered dyes, increased linearly with number of flowers on a plant. Total seed production, however, increased disproportionately quickly because plants with larger floral displays were more likely to set at least one fruit.

Queen removal results in a significant reduction in worker departure rate. The placement of a cooled, inactive queen into her queenless nest produces a significantly greater reduction in worker departure rate than does queen removal, and the resumption of activity by an inactive queen causes a significant increase in worker departure rate. Removal or cooling of a single worker does not produce similar effects on worker foraging, suggesting that the queen is the central regulator of worker foraging in small P. fuscatus colonies. We present evidence that: (1) the queen's control of worker foraging is mediated primarily by her influence on worker nest activity, (2) queen aggression may be important in stimulating departures by workers with low tendencies to leave the nest (i.e., dominant workers), and (3) the magnitude of the queen's stimulatory influence on worker foraging is directly related to the number of workers on the nest.

The movement-activity levels of whole colonies and of isolated groups of workers are studied. Whole colonies of Leptothorax allardycei show rhythmic changes in movement-activity level. Fourier and autocorrelation analyses indicate that the activity levels of colonies are periodic, with an average period of 26 min. Single, isolated workers do not show the pattern of periodic changes in activity level. Single workers become active spontaneously, but at no particular interval. Pairs of workers, confined together, also do not show periodicity in activity level. One worker can stimulate another worker to become active, thus coupling their movement-activity patterns. As ants are placed in larger groups, the variation in the interval between activity peaks declines in a manner predicted by coupled-oscillator theory. It is argued that the colony can be regarded as a population of excitable subunits, and it is shown that the results of this paper can be explained in this light. The formal similarity between movement-activity patterns in ant colonies and the dynamics of epidemics is noted. It is further argued that periodicity in the movement-activity levels of the colony is probably an epiphenomenon rather than an adaptation. Selection at the colonial level probably acts on the spontaneity of activity and coupling strength to produce changes in the overall activity level of the colony.

In separate trials each with a different food resource, the native S. geminata × xyloni retrieved the greatest amount of a protein‐ and lipid‐rich artificial food resource and a high protein natural food resource, and the native S. geminata retrieved the greatest amount of a high carbohydrate food resource. In trials investigating aspects of interference competition at the colony level, the invasive S. invicta proved to be initially more aggressive than S. geminata, but less aggressive than S. geminata × xyloni. Solenopsis invicta eventually controlled more of the foraging arenas against both native forms when colonies were equivalent by worker biomass, but not when colonies were equivalent by worker number. When paired with S. invicta, S. geminata suffered a significantly greater proportional reduction in both workers and entire colonies when colonies were initially standardized by worker biomass, but not when colonies were standardized by worker number. When paired with S. invicta, a significantly greater proportional reduction of workers occurred in S. geminata × xyloni, regardless of how colonies were standardized. In pairwise trials at the individual level, majors always exhibited significantly less mortality than minors, regardless of the Solenopsis form. The majors of both native forms suffered significantly less mortality than those of S. invicta. Superiority in colony‐level interference ability appears to be an important mechanism allowing S. invicta to displace native Solenopsis forms. The ability of S. invicta to reach high population densities, because of intrinsic biological characteristics or an escape from natural enemies, plays an important contributory role. Similar mechanisms may underlie the success of other invasive ant species.",W1983263576,False,0.7785001397132874

Size bias generally arises when estimates of competitive ability are erroneously influenced by the initial size of competing individuals. We employ a series of quantitative thought experiments to demonstrate the potential for size bias in analysis of four traditional experimental designs (pairwise, replacement series, additive series, and response surfaces) either when only final measurements are available or when both initial and final measurements are collected. We distinguish three questions relevant to describing competitive interactions: Which species dominates? Which species gains? and How do species affect each other? The choice of experimental design and measurements greatly influences the scope of inference permitted. Conditions under which the latter two questions can give biased information are tabulated. We outline a new approach to characterizing competition that avoids size bias and that improves the concordance between research question and experimental design. The implications of the choice of size metrics used to quantify both the initial state and the responses of elements in interspecific mixtures are discussed.

In chemical reactions rhythmic effects have been observed experimentally, and have also been shown, by the writer1 and others,2 to follow, under certain conditions, from the laws of chemical dynamics. However, in the cases hitherto considered on the basis of chemical dynamics, the oscillations were found to be of the damped kind, and therefore, only transitory (unlike certain experimentally observed periodic reactions). Furthermore, in a much more general investigation by the writer, covering the kinetics not only of chemical but also of biological systems, it appeared, from the nature of the solution obtained, improbable3 that undamped, permanent oscillations would arise in the absence of geometrical, structural causes, in the very comprehensive class of systems considered. For it seemed that the occurrence of such permanent oscillations, the occurrence of purely imaginary exponents in the exponential series solution presented, would demand peculiar and very specific relations between the characteristic constants of the systems undergoing transformation; whereas in nature these constants would, presumably, stand in random relation. It was, therefore, with considerable surprise that the writer, on applying his method to certain special cases, found these to lead to undamped, and hence indefinitely continued, oscillations. As the matter presents several features of interest, and illustrates certain methods and principles, it appears worth while to set forth the argument and conclusions here.

https://doi.org/10.2307/1942257,Community Structure: A Neutral Model Analysis,"The relation of community structure to community function is the subject of much ecological theorizing. Three approaches to the problem, based on cybernetics, control theory, and niche theory, can be identified. They concur in giving biological interactions a major role in the determination of community structure in general, and species diversity in particular. To examine this body of theory, I use a ""neutral"" model for community development, a model which eliminates completely the biological interactions in question. Comparison of the patterns of community structure resulting from this model with the structure of natural communities provides an estimate of the effect of the biotic interactions. This can then be compared to the theoretically predicted effects. The neutral model used was originally developed in population genetics. In the context in which it is used here, it describes the stochastic development of a set of noninteracting populations, which colonize a community, persist temporarily, and eventually become extinct. The model predicts the form of the distribution of relative abundances and of species area curves, and sample values of species diversity. Comparisons of the model's predictions with actual community structure are made across what are taken to be gradients in the importance of biological interaction (successional vs. climax communities, high variation vs. low variation environments, the temperate zone vs. the tropics), using data on birds, fish, trees and insects. The results clearly contradict some of the theories of community structure. In those situations where biological interactions are predicted to generate the greatest increase in species diversity, the neutral model analysis shows that diversity is in fact significantly lower than would be expected in the absence of such interactions. Some implications of these findings for community theory are discussed.",W1993337002,False,0.8566093444824219

It is often assumed that there is a trade‐off between maternal provisioning and dispersal capacity, leading small‐seeded species to disperse further than large‐seeded species. However, this relationship between dispersal distance and seed mass has only been quantified for species from particular sites or with particular dispersal syndromes. 2. We provided the first large‐scale, cross‐species quantification of the correlations between dispersal distance and both seed mass and plant height. Seed mass was positively related to mean dispersal distance, with a 100‐fold increase in seed mass being associated with a 4.5‐fold increase in mean dispersal distance ( R 2 = 0.16; n = 210 species; P &lt; 0.001). However, plant height had substantially stronger explanatory power than did seed mass, and we found a 5‐fold increase in height was associated with a 4.6‐fold increase in mean dispersal distance ( R 2 = 0.54; n = 211 species; P &lt; 0.001). 3. Once plant height was accounted for, we found that small‐seeded species dispersed further than did large‐seeded species ( R 2 = 0.54; n = 181 species; slope = −0.130; P &lt; 0.001); however, seed mass only added 2% to the R 2 of the model. Within dispersal syndromes, tall species dispersed further than did short species, while seed mass had little influence on dispersal distance. 4. Synthesis.

Successional management has been proposed as a useful model for managing and restoring invasive-plant-dominated rangeland because it provides a framework in which ecological processes can be manipulated by managers to achieve a desired plant community. Successional management identifies three general causes of succession (site availability [disturbance], species availability [colonization], and species performance) and suggests that managers address the ecological process influencing each general cause in a coordinated fashion to direct plant community dynamics. We tested successional management using various techniques to restore invasive-weed-dominated rangeland. Our hypothesis was that successively modifying the factors influencing the causes of succession in an integrated fashion would favor the establishment and abundance of native grasses over singularly applied treatments. Thus, we anticipated that the majority of responses to multiple treatments would be explained by higher order interactions, especially in the final year of the study (2004). To test this hypothesis, we used a model system within a Festuca campestris/Pseudoroegneria spicata habitat among pothole wetlands dominated by Centaurea maculosa and Potentilla recta, two invasive species. We used three herbicide treatments (none, 2,4-D, and picloram) to influence species performance; two seeding methods (imprinting, i.e., creating a small depression and broadcasting, and no-till drilling) to influence disturbance; three seeding rates (977, 1322, and 1557 seeds/m2) to influence colonization; and two cover crop treatments (with and without Triticum aestivum) to influence soil N and favor native grasses. Treatments were factorially arranged and replicated four times in a randomized complete block design in 2001 and sampled in 2002 and 2004. As predicted, plant response to treatments was dominated by two- and three-way interactions in 2004. The highest seeding rate (colonization) combined with no-till drilling (disturbance) produced the highest native grass density in 2002. These effects persisted into 2004 for P. spicata, but not for F. campestris or F. idahoensis. Combining picloram with no-till drill seeding also produced a high density of P. spicata. Drill seeding at 977 seeds/m2 favored F. idahoensis density, while no-till drilling at 1322 seeds/m2 favored its biomass in 2004. F. idahoensis established well after drill seeding with a cover crop and applying 2,4-D. Herbicides reduced native forb density and/or biomass, with early season forbs being more sensitive to picloram and summer forbs being more sensitive to 2,4-D. Herbicides increased exotic grasses' density and biomass but had no effect on native grasses. In most cases, integrating treatments that addressed multiple causes of succession favored a desired plant community. Thus, we accomplished our goal of using successional management to direct plant communities toward native desired species, but the treatments used did not improve species richness. Since naturally occurring native forbs did not respond favorably to any treatment combination, ecological restoration using successional management may best be thought of as an iterative procedure where various components and processes of the system are methodically repaired or replaced over time.",W1982979243,False,0.7931974530220032

We gathered nested-scale vegetation data on plant species richness, foliar cover, and frequency from 200 1-m2 subplots (20 1000-m2 modified-Whittaker plots) in the Colorado Rockies (USA), and 160 1-m2 subplots (16 1000-m2 plots) in the Central Grasslands in Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, and Minnesota (USA) to test the generality of this paradigm. At the 1-m2 scale, the paradigm was supported in four prairie types in the Central Grasslands, where exotic species richness declined with increasing plant species richness and cover. At the 1-m2 scale, five forest and meadow vegetation types in the Colorado Rockies contradicted the paradigm; exotic species richness increased with native-plant species richness and foliar cover. At the 1000-m2 plot scale (among vegetation types), 83% of the variance in exotic species richness in the Central Grasslands was explained by the total percentage of nitrogen in the soil and the cover of native plant species. In the Colorado Rockies, 69% of the variance in exotic species richness in 1000-m2 plots was explained by the number of native plant species and the total percentage of soil carbon. At landscape and biome scales, exotic species primarily invaded areas of high species richness in the four Central Grasslands sites and in the five Colorado Rockies vegetation types. For the nine vegetation types in both biomes, exotic species cover was positively correlated with mean foliar cover, mean soil percentage N, and the total number of exotic species. These patterns of invasibility depend on spatial scale, biome and vegetation type, spatial autocorrelation effects, availability of resources, and species-specific responses to grazing and other disturbances. We conclude that: (1) sites high in herbaceous foliar cover and soil fertility, and hot spots of plant diversity (and biodiversity), are invasible in many landscapes; and (2) this pattern may be more closely related to the degree resources are available in native plant communities, independent of species richness. Exotic plant invasions in rare habitats and distinctive plant communities pose a significant challenge to land managers and conservation biologists.",W2112486274,False,0.830906331539154
,CONDITION OF ROADSIDE VEGETATION IN RELATION TO NUTRIENT STATUS,"This article presents work which studied the effects of soil nutrient status on degradation of roadside vegetation in the wheatbelt of Western Australia. In particular, we studied the effects on weed invasion and insect herbivores. Road verges in the Kellerberrin district of Western Australia are severely affected by nutrient enrichment presumably from adjacent agricultural areas. In road verges dominated by the mallee, Eucalyptus erythronema, the percentage cover and diversity of exotic species of annuals and perennials show significant increases that correspond to increases in soil phosphorous. There are gradients in soil nutrients across road verges from high levels on the paddock side of the verge to low levels on the road side, and these correspond to similar gradients in the percentage cover and diversity of exotic species. The influence of the observed nutrient enrichment and the resultant increases in weed invasion on the native annuals and perennials is unclear. It appears that nutrient enrichment may increase the percentage cover of native species, but may also increase the competitiveness of exotic species, and so ultimately be to the detriment of the native species. Considerable methodological problems were encountered while investigating defoliation by insects in road verges. This made reliable conclusions based on the findings difficult, but some trends were apparent. The levels of defoliation of Eucalyptus erythronema in road verges (10+/- 1%) were low compared to the findings of other studies. Defoliation levels within reserves (8+/- 1%) were not significantly different to those in road verges. There were no correlations between insect defoliation of E. erythronema and either foliar nitrogen or soil nitrate and ammonium levels. Nor was there any correlation between foliar nitrogen and soil nitrate and ammonium levels. Some recommendations for methods to reduce the nutrient enrichment, and hence decrease the level of vegetation degradation on road verges, are discussed.

However, these characteristics are not constant within a species – instead, there is often both considerable interpopulation and interindividual variability. Also changes in selection pressures can result in the evolution of dispersal characteristics, with knock‐on consequences for a species’ population dynamics. Our aim here is to make our theoretical understanding of dispersal evolution more conservation‐relevant by moving beyond the rather abstract, phenomenological models that have dominated the literature towards a more mechanism‐based approach. Methods We introduce a continuous‐space, individual‐based model for wind‐dispersed plants where release height is determined by an individual’s ‘genotype’. A mechanistic wind dispersal model is used to simulate seed dispersal. Selection acts on variation in release height that is generated through mutation. Results We confirm that, when habitat is fragmented, both evolutionary rescue and evolutionary suicide remain possible outcomes when a mechanistic dispersal model is used. We also demonstrate the potential for what we term evolutionary entrapment. A population that under some conditions can evolve to be sufficiently dispersive that it expands rapidly across a fragmented landscape can, under different conditions, become trapped by a combination of limited dispersal and a large gap between patches.

The purpose of the model is to predict patterns and densities of seeds dispersed by animals (especially mammals) within a simulated landscape. The model was parameterized for sheep, cattle and deer as vectors but may be applied to other animals if data for parameterization is available. The model data base currently includes parameter values for about 100 plant species. Seed attachment to and seed detachment from the fur, as well as seed excretion after passage through the gut, are explicitly simulated by drawing randomly from distributions that were determined by standardized experiments. Animal movement is simulated as a correlated random walk, but to increase reality of the model, radio‐tracking data of animals can also be used. A sensitivity analysis of SEED was conducted to identify the relative importance of plant and animal traits. The analysis highlighted where the main gaps in our knowledge of seed dispersal processes lie. Even though in our study endozoochorous dispersal had the higher potential for long‐distance dispersal compared to epizoochory, there is only scarce knowledge about seed production and especially about the proportion of seeds eaten by an animal, parameters which were shown to be of major importance for dispersal. A comparison of variation in plant and animal traits, respectively, showed that dispersal kernels depend more on changes in the animal vector than on the comparably little variation a particular plant species can exhibit. For this reason, animal movement is, from all the dispersal‐relevant parameters, the one for which more exact data is most urgently needed. Synthesis. The newly developed simulation model will help to understand, quantify and predict long‐distance seed dispersal by animals. The possibility to incorporate real landscapes and movement data from very different animals makes the model generalizable and possibly applicable to a wide range of scientific and applied questions.",W1576410242,False,0.6756929159164429

At a landscape scale, these impacts, and biotic responses such as adaptation and migration, will be mediated by spatial heterogeneity in climate and climate change. We examine several aspects of the geography of climate change and their significance for biodiversity conservation. Location California and Nevada, USA. Methods Using current climate surfaces (PRISM) and two scenarios of future climate (A1b, 2070–2099, warmer‐drier and warmer‐wetter), we mapped disappearing, declining, expanding and novel climates, and the velocity and direction of climate change in California and Nevada. We also examined fine‐scale spatial heterogeneity in protected areas of the San Francisco Bay Area in relation to reserve size, topographic complexity and distance from the ocean. Results Under the two climate change scenarios, current climates across most of California and Nevada will shrink greatly in extent, and the climates of the highest peaks will disappear from this region. Expanding and novel climates are projected for the Central Valley. Current temperature isoclines are projected to move up to 4.9 km year −1 in flatter regions, but substantially slower in mountainous areas because of steep local topoclimate gradients. In the San Francisco Bay Area, climate diversity within currently protected areas increases with reserve size and proximity to the ocean (the latter because of strong coastal climate gradients). However, by 2100 of almost 500 protected areas (&gt;100 ha), only eight of the largest are projected to experience temperatures within their currently observed range. Topoclimate variability will further increase the range of conditions experienced and needs to be incorporated in future analyses.

Yet, before management options such as control or eradication can be considered, we need to know where a nuisance species has already spread. This is particularly difficult because of stochastic processes. Here, we develop an approach that requires little a priori information, yet accurately delimits the range of a biological invader. Location We used a simulated landscape, subjected to stochasticity inherent in establishment and spread, to test novel theory for delimiting locally spreading populations. Methods We distinguish three stages to identify the boundary of an invasion, which we term Approach, Decline, Delimit (ADD). Our ADD algorithm uses general characteristics of the invasion pattern, obtained during a search for occupied sites, in combination with sampling and probability theory to delimit the invasion. We compare ADD against four naïve delimitation strategies, for long and normal dispersal kernels. Results Our results illustrate the potential difficulty in delimiting invasions. Naïve strategies, such as stopping when the invader is absent, typically failed to properly delimit the invasion. In contrast, ADD operated relatively efficiently, and was robust to habitat heterogeneity and knowledge of the true epicentre, but was sensitive to the sparseness of the invasion. For long‐distance dispersal kernels, ADD had 80% accurate delimitations when c. 5% or more of the cells were occupied within the invasion boundary; for normal dispersal kernels, ADD had 95% accurate delimitations when c. 2.5% or more of the cells were occupied.

The first (diet A) had an equilibrated amino acid balance, similar to that derived from analysis of aphid carcass, and the other (diet B) had an unbalanced amino acid composition similar to that of legume phloem sap. Aphids grown on either diet expired the same quantity of sucrose carbon as CO(2), amounting to 25-30 % of the ingested sucrose catabolized in oxidation pathways. On diet A, the aphids excreted through honeydew about twice as much sucrose carbon as on diet B (amounting to 12.6 % of the ingested sucrose for diet A and 8.4 % for diet B), while amounts of sucrose carbons incorporated into exuviae were almost identical (1.9 % of the ingested sucrose on diet A and 2.7 % on diet B). There was also no difference in the amounts of sucrose carbon incorporated into the aphid tissues, which represented close to 50 % of the ingested sucrose. Sucrose carbons in the aphid tissues were mainly incorporated into lipids and the quantities involved were the same in aphids reared on either diet. On diet B, we observed neosynthesis of all protein amino acids from sucrose carbons and, for the first time in an aphid, we directly demonstrated the synthesis of the essential amino acids leucine, valine and phenylalanine. Amino acid neosynthesis from sucrose was significantly higher on diet B (11.5 % of ingested sucrose carbons) than on diet A (5.4 %). On diet A, neosynthesis of most of the amino acids was significantly diminished, and synthesis of two of them (histidine and arginine) was completely suppressed. The origin of amino acids egested through honeydew was determined from the specific activity of the free amino acid pool in the aphid. Aphids are able to adjust to variation in dietary amino acids by independent egestion of each amino acid. While more than 80 % of excreted nitrogen was from food amino acids, different amino acids were excreted in honeydew of aphids reared on the two diets. The conversion yields of dietary sucrose into aphid amino acids determined in this study were combined with those obtained previously by studying the fate of amino acids in pea aphids reared on diet A. The origin of all the amino acid carbons in aphid tissues was thus computed, and the metabolic abilities of aphid are discussed from an adaptive point of view, with respect to their symbiotic status.",W1927380886,False,0.33061960339546204

These endosymbiotic lineages show distinctive population structure, with small population size and effectively no recombination. As a result, endosymbionts are expected to accumulate mildly deleterious mutations. If these constitute a substantial proportion of new mutations, endosymbionts will show (i) faster sequence evolution and (ii) a possible shift in base composition reflecting mutational bias. Analyses of 16S rDNA of five independently derived endosymbiont clades show, in every case, faster evolution in endosymbionts than in free-living relatives. For aphid endosymbionts (genus Buchnera), coding genes exhibit accelerated evolution and unusually low ratios of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitutions compared to ratios for the same genes for enterics. This concentration of the rate increase in nonsynonymous substitutions is expected under the hypothesis of increased fixation of deleterious mutations. Polypeptides for all Buchnera genes analyzed have accumulated amino acids with codon families rich in A+T, supporting the hypothesis that substitutions are deleterious in terms of polypeptide function. These observations are best explained as the result of Muller's ratchet within small asexual populations, combined with mutational bias. In light of this explanation, two observations reported earlier for Buchnera, the apparent loss of a repair gene and the overproduction of a chaperonin, may reflect compensatory evolution. An alternative hypothesis, involving selection on genomic base composition, is contradicted by the observation that the speedup is concentrated at nonsynonymous sites.",W1968179480,False,0.4045305848121643
https://doi.org/10.1086/282957,Niche Breadth as a Function of Social Dominance,"If one species is socially dominant to another, the subordinate usually narrows its niche when they occur together. When one species is dominant in some circumstances and a second in others, both narrow their niches when together. Subordinates usually have a larger fundamental niche than their dominants. The presence of dominants should result in selection for enlarged (or changed) fundamental niches by the subordinate species. Linear hierarchies of species should result in guilds whose members have different-sized fundamental and realized niches. Though large mobile species often have greater fundamental niches than small similar species, an inverse relationship between size and niche breadth usually occurs where clear dominance hierarchies exist, suggesting that social dominance has more than counteracted the effect of body size. The presence of dominants is a factor making conditions uncertain for subordinates. Limits to the niche breadth of dominants are in some cases directly set by physical factors but in others are unknown, though they may be set by one or more of a variety of biological factors. In some cases subordinates appear to avoid interactions with dominants. Unequivocal examples of dominance-mediated niche relationships are thus far confined to certain vertebrate and arthropod groups, although evidence available suggests that they are more widely spread.",W1987012034,False,0.47050556540489197

https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1108197,Haploidploidy and the Evolution of the Social Insect,"Halminton (1) was apparently the first to appreciate that the synthesis of Mendelian genetics with Darwin's theory of natural selection had profound implications for social theory. In particular, insofar as almost all social behavior is either selfish or altruistic (or has such effects), genetical reasoning suggests that an individual's social behavior should be adjusted to his or her degree of relatedness, r, to all individuals affected by the behavior. We call this theory kinship theory. The social insects provide a critical test of Hamilton's kinship theory. When such theory is combined with the sex ratio theory of Fisher (9), a body of consistent predictions emerges regarding the haplodiploid Hymenoptera. The evolution of female workers helping their mother reproduce is more likely in the Hymenoptera than in diploid groups, provided that such workers lay some of the male-producing eggs or bias the ratio of investment toward reproductive females. Once eusocial colonies appear, certain biases by sex in these colonies are expected to evolve. In general, but especially in eusocial ants, the ratio of investment should be biased in favor of females, and in it is expected to equilibrate at 1 : 3 (male to female). We present evidence from 20 species that the ratio of investment in monogynous ants is, indeed, about 1 : 3, and we subject this discovery to a series of tests. As expected, the slave-making ants produce a ratio of investment of 1 : 1, polygynoys ants produce many more males than expected on the basis of relative dry weight alone, solitary bees and wasps produce a ratio of investment near 1 : 1 (and no greater than 1 : 2), and the social bumblebees produce ratios of investment between 1 : 1 and 1 : 3. In addition, sex ratios in monogynous ants and in trapnested wasps are, as predicted by Fisher, inversely related to the relative cost in these species of producing a male instead of a female. Taken together, these data provide quantitative evidence in support of kinship theory, sex ratio theory, the assumption that the offspring is capable of acting counter to its parents' best interests, and the supposition that haplodiploidy has played a unique role in the evolution of the social insects. Finally, we outline a theory for the evolution of worker-queen conflict, a theory which explains the queen's advantage in competition over male-producing workers and the workers' advantage regarding the ratio of investment. The theory uses the asymmetries of haplodiploidy to explain how the evolved outcome of parent-offspring conflict in the social Hymenoptera is expected to be a function of certain social and life history parameters.",W1989110437,False,0.5328044891357422

https://doi.org/10.2307/1943001,Models and Mechanisms of Succession: An Example From a Rocky Intertidal Community,"An investigation of the processes that cause succession was performed in an intertidal community on the central Oregon coast. The community was dominated by barnacles and several species of macroalgae. The successional sequence was determined at three different sites by clearing sets of plots in a way that mimicked natural disturbance. Succession at each of these sites followed the same general sequence. A barnacle, Chthamalus dalli, first colonized the plots and was later replaced by a second barnacle, Balanus glandula. The macroalgae Pelvetiopsis limitata, Fucus distichus, and Endocladia muricata colonized the plots only after Balanus was established. While the order of species arrival and departure was consistent, the rate of succession varied greatly among sites. The sequence of community development that was observed at one site over a 36—mo period occurred in &lt;12 mo in a nearby area. Differences in the rate of succession appeared to result from variation in the timing of successful Balanus recruitment. The mechanisms of succession were investigated in a series of field experiments. An experiment with Balanus—removal, Chthamalus—removal, and control plots was used to assess the interactions between barnacles. A direct interaction, competition for space with Balanus, caused Chthamalus to decrease in abundance as succession proceeded. Chthamalus did not affect the establishment of Balanus. Successful Balanus recruitment depended on occasional periods of larval settlement followed by periods of favorable weather. At all three sites, algal colonization was dependent on the presence of barnacles. Balanus greatly facilitated algal colonization, while Chthamalus only weakly facilitated algal colonization. Facilitation of algal colonization by epoxy—filled barnacle tests indicated that facilitation resulted from barnacle tests altering the substrate, rather than the activities of the living animals. A factorial experiment involving manipulations of barnacle and consumer (limpet) abundances demonstrated that the facilitation of algae by barnacles is an indirect interaction that is mediated by limpets. Barnacles decreased limpet foraging activity and thereby increased algal abundance. Succession in this community is complicated by several processes that are not included in traditional views of succession. (1) Not all early successional species have the same effect on the establishment of later successional species. This results in spatial variation in the rate of succession. (2) The model of succession is different in each step in the successional sequence. The Cthamalus—Balanus interaction is an example of the tolerance model, while the barnacle—algae interaction is an example of the facilitation model. (3) Both direct and indirect interactions between species determine the course of succession. The results of this study support a general model that predicts the effect of consumers on the rate of succession. Consumers slowed succession in this community in two ways. First, limpets delayed the establishment of Balanus and the competitive exclusion of Chthamalus. Second, limpets delayed the establishment of macroalgae. Previous studies in marine and terrestrial habitats have found that consumers may slow, accelerate, or have no effect on the rate of succession and these observations are consistent with the predictions of this general model.",W1984801193,False,0.4825063645839691

Many of these explanations are nonexclusive, which adds redundancy to confusion in considering the whole body of theory. Many of the cellular and/or biochemical mechanisms proposed amount to little more than detailed discussions of various possible gene end-products, which are themselves the subject of genetic and evolutionary theories. And even among these, no single theory predominates. J. B. S. Haldane (1941) and P. B. Medawar (1952) advanced the first theory of senescence incorporating a modem genetic and evolutionary perspective on the aging process. Their theory postulates the existence of specialized age-of-onset modifier genes which repress the action of other genes that are deleterious until an advanced age has been reached. Little harm results from the expression of the mutations then, however, and senescence gradually ensues with their derepression. In this theory, selection modifies life span by simply increasing or decreasing the period over which such modifiers are effective. Williams (19 57) later expanded on this, introducing the notion that the genes influencing senescence might themselves act pleiotropically with reciprocal effects at early and late ages. In this theory, the beneficial effects of genes early in life are weighed in evolution against their late life effects; youthful vigor must be accompanied by an early senescence and short life, while a delayed senescence and long life occur at the cost of youthful vitality. Apart from further extension of these ideas by Hamilton (1966) and Emlen (1 970), no new major theories of the evolution of senescence have arisen since Williams (1957). One reason for this may be that until recently, the few experimental tests performed contributed comparatively little substantiating information toward these theories. Early attempts at modifying life span through artificial selection include that of Glass (1960), who withheld mating in Drosophila to enforce an early versus late age-specific pattern of reproduction. This produced a slight increase in the longevity of late-reproducing lines. Wattiaux (1968) also found an increase in longevity in Drosophila under selection for an agespecific pattern of reproduction. This was followed by Sokal's (1970) study showing that continuous reproduction at an early age reduced median life span in Tribolium. Mertz (1975) found similar trends in an even later study. Taylor and Condra (1980) and Barclay and Gregory (1982) report changes in the longevity of Drosophila populations under rand K-selection or when exposed to predation. Concurrently with these, Lints and Hoste (1974, 1977) published the results of a well designed and extensive experiment that also selected for increased longevity in D. melanogaster through an early or late age-specific schedule of reproduction. But life span fluctuated wildly throughout the 13 generations of selection here, declining by 70% in the first few generations and then recovering. Further experiments (Lints et al., 1979)",W1535702947,False,0.4056611657142639
https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/97.3-4.679,DENSITY- AND FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT SELECTION AT THE <i>Mdh-2</i> LOCUS IN <i>DROSOPHILA PSEUDOOBSCURA</i>,"ABSTRACT We have studied differenccs in the number of Drosophila pseudoobscura produced in a culture when the flies differ with respect to two alleles (F and S) at the Mdh-2 locus, which codes for a malate dehydrogenase enzyme. The studies were done at low and at high density in two- and three-genotype combinations (S/S, F/F and S/F), with one-genotype cultures as controls.—— Density affects the fitness of the Mdh-2 genotypes. Different genotypes are differently affected, and the genotype of the competitors also makes a difference on the fitness of a given genotype. When three genotypes are present in a culture, particularly at high density, intergenotypic competition is less intense than intragenotypic competition at several frequency combinations. That is, there is ""overcompensation"": the three genotypes together exploit the environmental resources better than one genotype alone.———The fitness of the genotypes is frequency dependent in both two-genotype and three-genotype combinations. An inverse relationship between frequency and fitness is observed at high density. This may lead to a stable polymorphism, because the fitness of a genotype increases as its frequency decreases.——Forty independent strains, sampled from a natural population, were used in the experiments. This ensures that more than 95% of the variation present in the genome in the natural population is also present is the experimental cultures. It also ensures that the genetic background of the Mdh-2 alleles is randomized in the same way as it is in nature. However, the possibility remains that Mdh-2 alleles in nature are nonrandomly associated with alleles at closely linked loci. If linkage disequilibrium is present in the experiments because it exists in nature, then the observed effects (such as frequency-dependent selection) would affect the Mdh-2 locus in nature as well.",W1943399453,False,0.6205266118049622

Parasite-mediated heat and osmotic stress resistance have been demonstrated for Paramecium caudatum, infected by several species of parasitic bacteria of the genus Holospora. Here, using the micronucleus-specific bacterium Holospora undulata, we investigate how infection mediates the response of two genotypes (clones 'K8' and 'VEN') of P. caudatum to heat (35 °C) and osmotic (0.24% NaCl) stress. In contrast to previous findings, we find no evidence for heat stress protection in infected individuals. We do, however, show an effect of symbiont-mediated osmotic stress resistance for the K8 clone, with infected individuals having higher survival than their uninfected counterparts up to 24 h after the onset of salt exposure. Despite this, both infected and uninfected individuals of the VEN clone showed higher survival rates than clone K8 individuals under osmotic stress. Thus, it would seem that parasite-mediated stress protection is restricted to certain combinations of host genotypes and types of stress and does not represent a general phenomenon in this system.",W1889725672,False,0.41453003883361816

Plankton live in a world that is radically different from ours, and to which we have limited access. Visualization is central to developing an intuition for this world, which together with insights in small-scale fluid physics may allow a mechanistic understanding of individual interactions and deduction of properties of populations and ecosystems.

All showed an increase in velocity (micrometers per second) in more viscous solutions. Velocity reached a maximum at a characteristic value, however, and thereafter decreased with higher viscosities.

Effects of temperature, and possible utilization of chemical constituents in the viscous solutions, were studied and found to be negligible factors under the experimental conditions used. Different agents produced the same phenomenon, thus indicating that there probably were no chemically induced metabolic effects. Loss of available water and the possibility of a variable energy supply to the flagellar propulsive system were considered but are believed minimal.

The symbiote-containing flagellates are exposed to complement and antisera prepared in rabbits against symbiote-free organisms. The immune lysis seems to weaken the plasma membranes of the flagellates so that subsequent application of gentle shearing force liberates the intracellular entities in an undamaged condition. The symbiotes are then separated from other cellular components by DNAse digestion and differential centrifugation. The average recovery of symbiotes isolated by this method is 20%. Light and electron microscopy establishes the structural integrity and numerical abundance of isolated symbiotes in the final fractions. Integrity of symbiotes is further indicated by the high activity of a marker enzyme, uroporphyrinogen I synthetase. The DNA's of symbiote-containing and symbiote-free flagellates, and of isolated symbiotes were purified and compared after isopycnic centrifugation. The comparison establishes the presence of DNA's in symbiotes of both species. The guanine-cytosine (G-C) content of symbiote DNA differs from that of host DNA's in C. oncopelti, but resembles that of kinetoplast DNA in B. culicis. The latter observation was further shown by heat denaturation study.

Chloroplast membranes were the principal site for metabolism of the compound by at least two highly hydrophobic enzyme systems, hydroperoxide lyase and hydroperoxide dehydrase, the new name for an enzyme system formerly known as hydroperoxide isomerase and hydroperoxide cyclase. Hydroperoxide lyase was most active above pH 7 and could be separated from hydroperoxide dehydrase by anion exchange chromatography. Hydroperoxide dehydrase, measured by the formation of both alpha-ketol product and 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, had its optimum activity in the range of pH 5 to 7. Lyase was more active than dehydrase activity when the enzymes were extracted by homogenization. The reverse was true when the enzyme activities were measured in protoplasts, which are isolated by gentle extraction methods. The variation in enzyme activity ratios with extraction methods suggests that hydroperoxide lyase is activated by plant injury and thus may function in a wound response. In the absence of injury, the normal pathway of fatty acid hydroperoxide metabolism is probably by hydroperoxide dehydrase activity.

From the host plant‐spider mite complex Phaseolus lunatus—Tetranychus urticae Koch a volatile chemical is emitted that acts as a kairomone for the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias‐Henriot (Sabelis et al., 1984a). This kairomone is apparently a byproduct of a vital physiological process and/or it has a function in the biology of the spider mite as well. The spider mite—host plant complex also emits a volatile spider‐mite dispersing pheromone. This is shown in the present study where spider mites were introduced into an odour patch on a horizontal screen in a vertical airflow olfactometer. When spider‐mite infested leaves of Lima bean are offered, the spider mites walk mainly straight and soon reach the edge of the screen. On the other hand, when clean Lima bean leaves are offered, the mites walk tortuously most of the time and reach the edge of the screen much later. Artificially damaged plants elicit the same response as undamaged plants. Differences in spider‐mite behaviour are observed in the vertical airflow olfactometer when odour of either clean or spider‐mite infested leaves is offered. A comparison of the behaviour in these two situations with that when no odour was offered suggests that Lima bean leaves emit a volatile kairomone that activates T. urticae and makes them return after losing the stimulus. A Y‐tube olfactometer experiment confirms the existence of this kairomone. At a low ratio of dispersing pheromone to plant kairomone, the spider mites behave as if only kairomone is present, walking mainly tortuously. At a high ratio they disperse. No aggregation‐pheromonal effect is observed. The possibility that the spider‐mite dispersing pheromone acts as a kairomone for P. persimilis is discussed.",W2002033052,False,0.25225162506103516

The structural similarity of trans-10-ODA and traumatic acid, a compound considered to be a wound hormone, suggested that trans-10-ODA might be a precursor of traumatic acid. Both trans-10-ODA and traumatic acid were active in the Wehnelt bean assay. The results were more consistent with trans-10-ODA than with traumatic acid. Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L. var. National Pickling) hypocotyls also showed a growth increase following treatment with trans-10-ODA, which suggested that trans-10-ODA has a more general influence on plant development than previously ascribed to traumatic acid.Runner beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L. var. Kentucky Wonder) were analyzed for the presence of endogenous trans-10-ODA and traumatic acid. These are the beans from which traumatic acid was originally isolated in 1939. They contained trans-10-ODA but no traumatic acid. Young beans were a better source of trans-10-ODA than older beans and an increase in the esterified form of trans-10-ODA with age may have been due to a conversion of the free acid to the esterified form. The amount of endogenous trans-10-ODA increased when bean pod tissue was sliced and wounded. Rapid stirring and the presence of oxygen increased autooxidation of trans-10-ODA to traumatic acid in runner beans, which indicated that the compound identified as traumatic acid is formed by autooxidation of trans-10-ODA and that trans-10-ODA is a natural compound with growth-regulating properties.Enzyme extracts of runner beans synthesized trans-10-ODA from linoleic acid. No enzymic synthesis of traumatic acid was observed even when cofactors were added to the reaction mixture.

https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12014,Dangerous prey and daring predators: a review,"ABSTRACT How foragers balance risks during foraging is a central focus of optimal foraging studies. While diverse theoretical and empirical work has revealed how foragers should and do manage food and safety from predators, little attention has been given to the risks posed by dangerous prey. This is a potentially important oversight because risk of injury can give rise to foraging costs similar to those arising from the risk of predation, and with similar consequences. Here, we synthesize the literature on how foragers manage risks associated with dangerous prey and adapt previous theory to make the first steps towards a framework for future studies. Though rarely documented, it appears that in some systems predators are frequently injured while hunting and risk of injury can be an important foraging cost. Fitness costs of foraging injuries, which can be fatal, likely vary widely but have rarely been studied and should be the subject of future research. Like other types of risk‐taking behaviour, it appears that there is individual variation in the willingness to take risks, which can be driven by social factors, experience and foraging abilities, or differences in body condition. Because of ongoing modifications to natural communities, including changes in prey availability and relative abundance as well as the introduction of potentially dangerous prey to numerous ecosystems, understanding the prevalence and consequences of hunting dangerous prey should be a priority for behavioural ecologists.",W1955256553,False,0.8870599269866943
https://doi.org/10.1159/000064909,Multisensory Cues and Multimodal Communication in Spiders: Insights from Video/Audio Playback Studies,"Spiders perceive the world using multiple sensory modes, including vibration, vision, and chemical senses, for prey detection and communication. These sensory modes are used in many communication contexts, either individually or in multimodal signaling. Selection for effective signaler-receiver communication and species discrimination is especially strong for these predatory and potentially cannibalistic arthropods, resulting in the evolution of considerable diversity in signaling behaviors. In this paper, we review sensory mechanisms involved in spider signaling and present an overview of recent work done on wolf spiders (Lycosidae) that use multimodal communication (simultaneous visual and vibratory signals) in sexual signals during courtship. The relative importance of visual and vibratory signaling modes, and the use of multiple modes varies among closely related species in the genus &lt;i&gt;Schizocosa&lt;/i&gt;, providing a model system for investigating multisensory guidance of complex behavior. Here we examine previous and current research on responses of female spiders to components of male courtship behavior, using several experimental techniques including cue isolation (single sensory modes), video/audio digitization and playback, and cue-conflict (mixed conspecific/heterospecific components) to tease apart elements of multimodal signaling.",W1982802297,False,0.01747562177479267

All data were collected from captive animals in laboratory conditions. Using sequences of predatory behaviour recorded on movie film, two aspects of predation were compared: (a) attack strategy, that is, the behavioural patterns leading up to biting the prey, and (2) head shaking movements used during killing. All individual predators of all species but Dasyuroides byrnei exhibited avoidance of attacking prey from the front. Indeed, two of the four individual Dasyuroides used not only did not avoid frontal attack but selected to do so even when attacks from the rear or side were possible (e.g., the prey sat unmoving in the centre of the enclosure). Frontal attacks by Dasyuroides involved the use of the forepaws to grasp and pin prey, and the directing of killing bites to the head. These two behaviour patterns are also present in the other three species of dasyurids. Therefore, the frontal attack employed by this species does not involve the use of novel behaviour patterns. Analysis of head shakes revealed two basic forms. From a downward pointing position the head was rotated in one of two ways: the snout traversed an arc in space, as seen in Felis catus and Dasyurus hallucatus, or the sagittal crest traversed an arc in space, as seen in the other three species of dasyurids. When the prey is held down by the forepaws, either form of head shake enhances penetration of the canines into the prey, whereas, when not held down by the forepaws, both forms of head shake can disorient prey, enabling subsequent killing bites to be applied.",W1965755088,False,0.8315057754516602

Several phytophagous and predacious mites proved to be good prey species for the predator, but some small insects, such as Typhlocyba sp. and Aphis pomi were less suitable. Reproduction on a diet of Vicia fabae pollen was distinctly lower than on animal prey. Electrophoretic analysis of gut contents of field collected predators showed that these fed almost exclusively on the rust mite Aculus schlechtendali. In a number of instances, Typhlodromus pyri could be identified as the prey of O. vicinus. The predator was only observed on trees of the apple cultivar Beauty of Boskoop.

(Cicadellidae) on the leaves of ssge gives rise to the appearance of chlorotic spots, as a result of damaged mesophyll cells becoming filled with air. The length of the mandibular stylets in this species (as averaged from the adult and five nymphal instars) is 67 per cent. of that of the maxillaries, both types of stylet being slightly larger in females. The mandibular stylets when inserted do not penetrate much below the leaf surface where they are held by barbs and a salivary sheath, and the total extent of their insertion is only 29 per cent. of that of the maxillary stylets. The latter are the main penetrating organs; the stylets may move together or independently and are not surrounded by a sheath. Mandibular and maxillary penetration is greatest in fifth-stage nymphs, the mean (and maximum) distances being 97 (205) μ and 177 (340) μ respectively. It increases progressively from the first nymphal stage, and in the adult shows mean values near those of nymphs in the third or fourth stage. Rate and depth of stylet penetration is very variable, due to repeated maxillary protraction and retraction, and there is little correlation between the lengths to which the mandibular and the maxillary stylets are extended. Exuvial stylets, particularly the mandibulars of fifth-stage numphs, consistently show a graeter degree of extruction than is to be found in nymphs when feeding normally: such deeper insertion may help to anchor the insect more firmly during ecdysis. Stylet insertion is by pressure, intracellular, and very rapid (attaining rates up to 115μ per minute). The sex of the individual insect and the leaf-surface attacked have no effect on depth of penetration, at least in certain nymphal stages, and all tissues of the lamina are available for feeding, even to first-stage nymphs, in consequence of the relatively greater development of the stylets in the younger insects. During penetration the mandibular stylets move alternately and initially lead, but quickly come to rest, and further penetration is by the maxillaries which follow a mainly intracellular path. Protrusion of one maxillary stylet beyond the other (up to a maximum distance of 112μ.) was observed in plant tissue and observations of feeding on stripped epidermis show that such a stylet can empty cells at its apex. Protoplasts are removed from a cell within a few seconds, and as this appears to be too short a time to allow digestion, it is assumed that chloroplasts must be mechanically fragmented on passage into the food canal. Removal may be a two-stage process, and if it is assumed that sometimes only the first stage is completed, and is accompanied by saliva injection, it is possible to explain the occurrence, as unimbibed residue, of plasmolysed degenerating chromophilic cells scattered throughout damaged tissue, which occurs mainly in the palisade and spongy parenchyma, and only seldom in vascular tissue. There is no evidence for diffusion of any salivary toxin from damaged cells or from the sheath. Stylet-tracks in damaged areas are unbranched and short and rarely give any indication of the cells fed upon or of the repeated probing by the maxillary stylets that is known to occur.",W2004743096,False,0.6850915551185608

Single—prey trials at six densities of each prey were used to measure the functional responses of 10th—instar naiads of the damselfly Enallagma aspersum to a copepod, Diaptomus spatulocrenatus, and a cladoceran, Simocephalus serrulatus. Rogers' random predator equation, a modification of Holling's type 2 functional response equation, described the data well. The predictions of a one—predator/two—prey model based on the random predator equation were tested by performing all 36 pairwise combinations of densities of the two prey species in a factorial design. The model predicts that naiads should show a preference for Simocephalus over Diaptomus, and that Diaptomus should experience a greater reduction in predation in the presence of Simocephalus than should Simocephalus in the presence of Diaptomus. The two—prey trials show that the reverse is true; the model fails to predict these results adequately. Preference varied slightly with the density of Diaptomus, but not with the density of Simocephalus, total prey density, or the ratio of the two prey types. The ""attack"" and ""handling time"" parameters that describe predation on Diaptomus both increased significantly with increasing density of Simocephalus, and the ""handling time"" parameter for predation on Simocephalus decreased significantly with increasing density of Diaptomus. There was no evidence of switching behavior in this system. Clearly, the outcome of this three—species interaction cannot be predicted by studying only the component two—species interactions. A modified random predator model, which incorporates changes in the ""attack rate"" and ""handling time"" parameters with alternate prey density, provided a better fit to the two—prey data. The factorial design, which requires experiments involving all three species, permits the use of other, less mechanistic, models as well.",W1983942191,False,0.8871887922286987
https://doi.org/10.1086/284153,Optimal Foraging and the Form of the Predator Isocline,"I explore the relation between optimal foraging and the geometrical character of the predator isocline. Two basic models are discussed. The first is a multispecies generalization of Holling's ""disc"" equation. If a predator can rapidly discriminate among prey types, it is argued that its isoclines should not have positive slopes. Isoclines with positive slopes may occur if the predator must invest time discriminating between prey of unequal value, and there is a high absolute abundance of the better quality prey species. For a food-limited predator, however, selection should moderate the degree of rightward slope. In the second model, encounter and capture rates vary directly with relative prey abundance because of switching behavior. A number of published switching models are shown to produce isoclines with partially positive slopes. If the attack rates on each of two prey species are functionally related, it is argued that an optimally foraging predator will either have rectangular isoclines or isoclines with negative slope. This suggests that existing switching models are not completely satisfactory representations of switching behavior. A few examples of predators with isoclines of positive slope have been observed. Some possible mechanisms for generating such isoclines are discussed briefly. Several central ideas in community theory would founder were predators often to have isoclines with positive slopes.",W1995509319,False,0.4835261106491089

Mosquito larvae and two alternative prey, the zooplankter Daphnia pulex and vestigial—winged Drosophila (representing terrestrial prey trapped on the water surface), were presented to the predator at various densities. Preference, searching times, capture times (searching time per prey captured), and handling times for mosquito larvae were estimated. The predator showed a significant preference for Daphnia relative to mosquitoes in three of the nine prey combinations tested, and a significant preference for Drosophila relative to mosquitoes in all prey combinations tested. The presence of Daphnia did not significantly affect searching or capture times for mosquitoes, whereas the presence of Drosophila was associated with a significant decreased in searching time and a significant increase in mean capture time. Mosquito handling time decreased slightly as Daphnia density increased. The results predict that Drosophila will have a greater effect than Daphnia on the ability of notonectids to control mosquito larvae. The prediction was supported by a longer term experiment in which the largest number of mosquitoes reached the pupal stage when Drosophila were present as alternative prey. The study shows that relative preferences alone are not sufficient to predict the effect of alternative prey on a predator's functional response. Factors such as handling time (which affects searching time) and behavioral changes such as a change in capture time, must also be considered when assessing the role of alternative prey in a biological control program.",W2000069044,False,0.8907393217086792

https://doi.org/10.2307/2530490,A Note on a Model for Selection Experiments,"A selection process on a finite number of individuals divided into K classes is considered. The individuals are selected one by one, without l-eplacemellt, until a fixed number has been chosen. It is assumed that individuals in the same class have the same probability of being chosen at any stage, but this probability can vary from class to class. More precisely, the probability of selection from a class is assumed to be proportional to the product of the number of individuals remaining in that class and a weighting factor. This model appeals to be quite realistic for some types of selective predation experiments.

https://doi.org/10.2307/3799,Predator Ingestion Rate and its Bearing on Feeding Time and the Theory of Optimal Diets,"(1) Two insect predators, Adalia bipunctata (L.) and Notonecta glauca (L.) are shown to have ingestion rates which decline over the time whilst the animal is feeding on a single prey item. The decline is not due to satiation. (2) A model which maximizes the average rate of energy harvest is applied to the ingestion curve effect. The length of time spent feeding on a prey item is determined by this average rate and predicts that feeding times will be shorter in more profitable environments. (3) Experiments support the prediction that feeding time per item and the amount of food eaten per item decreases as the intercatch interval shortens. Unlike predictions from a gut limiting hypothesis, feeding times seem to be related to the average intercatch interval not the individual intercatch intervals. (4) The ingestion rate effect is incorporated into an optimal diet model. Prey types should not be ranked by their average profitability but by their unexploited profitability. (5) The modified optimal diet model will predict a variety of functional response curves dependent on the form of the ingestion curve. These include double plateau and sigmoid curves. The model offers a means of studying multi-prey type functional responses from an optimal foraging point of view.",W2006563009,False,0.7923105955123901

https://doi.org/10.1086/283198,A Mathematical Model of Coevolving Populations,"We present a general model for coevolution of two interacting populations which we believe can serve as a framework for theoretical investigations in this area. The model describes coevolution of two competitors, exploiter and victim. or two mutualistic species. The conditions on the parameters of the model which are required for local stability of various equilibria are derived. In order to simplify analysis the stability conditions are separated into those which are independent of the nature of the time response of the system (intrinsic conditions) and those which depend on the time response. For the most part, only intrinsic conditions are discussed. Because of the nature of the model the results of our analysis are stated only in general terms. Much of their significance will depend on the particular coevolutionary systems being analyzed. The results of our analysis indicate that coevolution may result in stable coexistence of two populations even when the stability conditions derived from generalized versions of the Lotka-Volterra equations are violated; that coevolution may also destabilize what appears to be a stable interaction between populations; and that coevolution may result in stable disruptive selection regimes. Local stability has been the focus of this paper, but the local instability, say, of polymorphic equilibria does not exclude the possibility of time-dependent polymorphic solutions.

Rarely are experiments designed to permit a partitioning of variation in muscle electrical activity patterns. Analysis of muscle activity during aquatic prey capture in two morphologivally distinct species of salamanders, Ambystoma dumerilii and A. mexicanum, is conducted to assess variation at four levels: between species, among individuals within species, among experiments conducted on different days, and among feedings. The results show that (1) mean correlations among the 11 electromyographic variables measured for each feeding are low and vary considerably among individuals, (2) many of the variables show significant differences among experimental days, (3) only one variable, the difference in timing between the depressor mandibulae and sternohyoideus muscles, showed significant variation between species, and (4) seven of the 11 variables showed significant variation among individuals within species. Overall, the variation between feedings (trials) was high, and there was some variation between days on which the experiments were conducted. Neither electrode position within the muscle nor satiation contributed to the high trial variance. The results suggest that functional analyses of feeding behavior should include an assessment of variation due to individuals, days, and trials, because the amount of variation at these levels may render differences between species nonsignificant.",W2035250200,False,0.1952306479215622

This experiment was designed to measure simultaneously the effects of initial larval density, food level, pond drying regime, and their interactions on the percentage of individuals metamorphosing or becoming paedomorphic. A higher percentage of individuals metamorphosed from drying low—density, and high—food ponds than from constant water level, high—density, and low—food ponds. A higher percentage of individuals became paedomorphic in constant water—level and low—density ponds than in drying and high—density ponds. Food level had no effect on the expression of paedomorphosis. Initial density, food level, and drying regime all had significant effects on the mean snout—vent length of larvae in ponds. The percentage of paedomorphic individuals in a pond was positively correlated with mean snout—vent length in the population. Analysis of covariance using snout—vent length as the covariate removed density and food level effects on the percentage of metamorphic individuals but did not remove the effects of drying regime. Use of snout—vent length as covariate in an analysis of covariance for the percentage of paedomorphic individuals failed to remove significant effects of density or drying regime. Only initial density affected the survival of larvae. The factors manipulated in this experiment affected the expression of paedomorphosis both directly through the physical environmental conditions that they created and indirectly through the growth and body size of larvae. These results suggest that differences in environmental factors among populations can affect the life—history pathways of individuals and lead to a predominance of paedomorphosis in permanent aquatic habitats with favorable growth environments.",W1969744771,False,0.8297626376152039

During the propulsive phase, the humerus moves anteroposteriorly 40–55° and rotates a total of 30–40°. Simultaneously, the coracoid translates posteriorly along the tongue‐and‐groove coracosternal joint by a distance equivalent to about 40% the length of the coracoid. Biceps brachii, coraco‐brachialis brevis and longus, the middle and posterior parts of the latissimus dorsi and pectoralis, serratus anterior, serratus anterior superficialis, subscapularis, supracoracoideus, and triceps usually become active during the late swing phase and continue activity throughout most or all of propulsion. The anterior part of the latissimus dorsi is active during the transition from propulsive to swing phases. Brachialis, deltoideus scapularis, levator scapulae, the anterior part of pectoralis, scapulo‐humeralis posterior, and subcoracoideus are active primarily during the swing phase; they are occasionally active during propulsion. Deltoideus clavicularis, scapulo‐humeralis posterior, sternocoracoideus, and the posterior part of the trapezius are biphasic, with activity in both the propulsive and swing phases. A number of shoulder muscles in Varanus exanthematicus and Didelphis virginiana (the Virginia opossum) are similar in attachments, in activity patterns with respect to phases of the step cycle, and in apparent actions. These similarities are interpreted as a pattern inherited from the ancestors of higher tetrapods.

Also, substantial differences in electrode tip configuration and wire diameter induce relatively minor, less than 8 percent, differences in electrode resistance and impedance. Doubling the length of the fine wire leads produces less than an 8 percent (15 percent when the length is tripled) effect; however, the effect of electrode material may be as much as 85 percent in resistance and 20 percent in impedance. Reports of nonreproducibility or variability of electromyograms apparently result mainly from anatomically inexact placement into physiologically and histochemically different fascicles of compound muscles, from recordings of muscles that are active at very low levels, and perhaps from comparison among recordings of muscles that really differ in their activity level.",W1972298619,False,0.0028674600180238485

Analysis of the anatomy of the pharyngeal apparatus of parrotfish demonstrates extraordinary specialization of the grinding jaws. The epibranchials have lost their gill-bearing function. The first epibranchial is the structural element of the pharyngeal valve that is operated by the first levator externus, first branchial adductor and part one of the transversus dorsalis muscles. Five pairs of muscles (fourth levator externus, levator posterior lateralis and medialis, fifth branchial adductor, part two of the transversus ventralis) are positioned to adduct the lower pharyngeal. The retractor dorsalis and fourth obliquus dorsalis are positioned to retract the upper pharyngeal. The third levator internus and transversus dorsalis posterior protract the upper pharyngeal. The fourth levator externus, both parts of the levator posterior and the fifth adductor are massive and pinnate. Deep fossae for the attachment of the fourth levator externus and levator posterior muscles are sculpted out of the neurocranium. A ventral spike process of the prootic and expanded hemal postzygapophyses of the first three vertebrae are skeletal features associated with the elaborated musculature of the pharynx. Synovial joints are present between the basicranium and upper pharyngeals, between the upper pharyngeals and fourth epibranchials and between the lower pharyngeal and cleithrum. The upper pharyngeals act as a single unit bound by cruciate ligaments. The fourth epibranchial is a key element in the pharyngeal apparatus and serves to direct forces generated by the transversus ventralis, fifth adductor, levator posterior lateralis, transversus dorsalis posterior and fourth obliquus dorsalis.",W2062455464,False,0.0006473343819379807

The development of populations of Daphnia magna was followed at two different constant temperatures. Sixteen populations were maintained at 18° and 21 at 25° C. The 50 cc. of pond water which served as medium were renewed every other day and always contained an excess quantity of the food-alga Chlorella. 2. Population development at 25° proved oscillatory in nature, four peaks occurring in 234 days, with a maximum population size of 126 animals. In the 174 days of observation at 18°, one major peak was observed (maximum 241) followed by a decrease and virtual stabilization at a population density of about 135. 3. Analysis of the oscillation disclosed that it is due to a delay in the expression of the effects of population density upon birth and death rates. 4. The mechanism of oscillation at 25° is an alternation of fluctuations in numbers of births and numbers of deaths. The mechanism at 18° is the fluctuation in the number of births about a nearly constant number of deaths. 5. Experiments with a series of population densities artificially maintained constant showed that birth rate at 25° is an inverse function of population density. At 18° the effect of density is similar but less severe. 6. Under these conditions of constant density, mortality at 25° is in general a function of population density, although the minimal mortality occurs at a density of 5. At 18° mortality is but little affected by conditions of density, and is apparently least at about 75 animals/50 cc. 7. The mean of population size at 18° was two and one half times as great as that at 25°. 8. This fact is compared to the supposed greater density of planktonic populations in polar than in tropical waters. The results of this study cannot be applied to the problem of marine plankton abundance since the limiting factor in the present case (the conditioning of the medium by the accumulation of metabolites and/or depletion of the dissolved oxygen supply) is presumably never operative in the ocean, although it may be operative in some fresh water situations. 9. The possibility of accounting for the greater mean size of the 18° populations by reference to the direct effect of temperature upon longevity is considered but rejected. A basic fallacy is pointed out in the theory which attempts to explain by such a direct effect of temperature the greater density of asymptotic populations in polar than in tropical regions. 10. It is concluded that the influence of temperature upon mean population size observed in these experiments is indirect: the temperature difference exerts its effect only by modifying the action of population density.",W1827580088,False,0.8730226159095764

This species lays in small ponds and only a portion of each is used as a spawning ground. The males are the first to reach the water in the spring. 88.8 per cent. of all the toads in a pond at any given time are males. Males are in proportion to females as 80.7: 100. Trilling in the full vigorous voice is heard only during the mating season. Females respond to the call of the males. Males will not hold other males. Spawn may be deposited at a depth of eighteen inches or more. This depth does not affect materially the hatching. Fertilization takes place in an improvised basket formed by the hind feet of the male and the body and hind legs of the female. 85 per cent. of the eggs laid in natural ponds are fertile. Oviposition requires six to eighteen hours. The laying of two or four strands of eggs at a time e an not be considered of specific importance. Toads lay 3,900 to 15,800 eggs at one laying. The eggs hatch in two to six days, depending upon the temperature. Metamorphosis takes place in thirty-two to two hundred days. On an average the tadpoles double their weight seven times in thirty-two days. The tadpoles are omnivorous. Toads feed entirely on animal matter. No food is taken unless it shows signs of life. Toads refuse no insects, worms or slugs which they can swallow. On an average toads feed only once in a day and a half. The average amount eaten in a day by a toad is 1.12 grams. About 80 per cent. of the toad's food consists of harmful insects. Toads may be active from the latter part of March to the middle of November. Toads are chiefly nocturnal. Toads go into the ground to pass the winter. The greater per cent. of those that do not get below the frost-line perish.

We assume that the animal chooses the option that maximizes its fitness and investigate how the animal's energetic gain and probability of being killed change when the environment is changed. It is shown that two aspects of the change strongly influence the results. One aspect is how the change differentially affects the foraging options. If an improvement in the food supply has more of an effect on good than on poor sources of food, intake rate will tend to increase. If the improvement has more of an effect on poor options, then intake rate may decrease. The other aspect is whether the change is transitory or relatively permanent. In a particular model, short-term changes that improve the environment increase intake rate, whereas long-term improvements result in intake rate's remaining constant or decreasing.

https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.203.14.2149,Influence of Tail Shape on Tadpole Swimming Performance,"ABSTRACT Many tadpoles respond to insect predators by developing deeper, and sometimes longer, tails. It has been assumed that the larger tail enhances aspects of swimming performance, because deep-tailed tadpoles survive well when confronted with hunting predators. We tested this hypothesis using both naturally occurring and surgically created variation in tail morphology of Hyla versicolor tadpoles. We measured swimming performance (maximum speed, time to reach a 2.5 cm radius, and angle of escape) and morphology (size and shape of the body and tail) in 288 tadpoles, of which half possessed the predator-induced morphology and the other half were from predator-free ponds. Large tadpoles swam faster than small ones, and shape was significantly correlated with size-corrected swimming performance. The fastest tadpoles had relatively shallow bodies and tail fins, and short tails; there was no difference in swimming performance between predator-induced and no-predator tadpoles. We performed an experiment to create independent variation in tail depth and length by surgically manipulating tail shape in 270 tadpoles. Three tail-length treatments reduced the length of the tail fin by 21 %, 34 % and 55 %; three tail-depth treatments reduced the maximum depth of the tail fin by 11 %, 34 % and 59 %; two additional treatments controlled for the effects of anaesthesia and surgery. The angle of escape was unaffected by surgery. Maximum speed and minimum escape time were both significantly impaired by the high-removal treatments, but showed no evidence of decline until 30 % of the tail (length or depth) was removed. These results suggest that the relatively deep tails in predator-induced tadpoles (approximately 10 % deeper than in no-predator tadpoles) do not improve performance in burst swimming.

Since perfect information is impossible to acquire, it has been suggested that animals use simple rules of thumb to acquire information. The use of rules, however, may lead to substantially inaccurate perceptions. In this article, we present the results of a dynamic optimization model developed to study the opportunity for the evolution of rules of thumb for predation hazard assessment. There are four main conclusions from this model. First, selection will not always favor perfect estimates, if one assumes there is some cost in acquiring accurate information. There is a zone of tolerance where inaccurate perceptions perform just as well as perfect knowledge of predation hazard. This implies that animals need not have perfect, only sufficient, information in order to behave optimally. Second, this zone of tolerance is generally shifted toward overestimating predation hazard: animals that overestimate hazard will have a lower mortality than animals that underestimate hazard. Third, animals should attempt to track fluctuating predation hazard rather than act on the average predation hazard. Finally, the model is robust: several simplying assumptions can be relaxed, and the same general conclusions are reached. We suggest instances where animals are using simple rules to assess predation hazard and outline an experimental protocol to study the use of rules of thumb for predation hazard assessment.",W1984575743,False,0.33593469858169556

Tentative boundary conditions are established by which lakes inappropriate to the models can be excluded. Confidence intervals for predicted values about the mean are given for the fish yield–phytoplankton standing crop regression. From this relation, potential yields for the lakes studied are reduced from a range of 10,000 to one of 25-fold. Efficiencies with which carbon is transferred from primary production to fish yield vary by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude and are highest for small, intensively managed ponds and lowest for large, deep, cold-water lakes. Models based upon fish yield as a function of phytoplankton production or standing crop are inherently more accurate and subject to fewer exceptions than are those related to morphoedaphic factors. The former appear to be capable of substantial refinement but even in their present state might be employed to make useful predictions for groups of lakes. A suggested supplement to existing approaches in fishery management involves the following sequence: (1) use of expectation-variability diagrams to obtain an overview of the problem, (2) selection of an appropriate model or models to predict yield, (3) prediction of a range of yields, and (4) implementation of regulations proved successful for other lakes in the same yield category.

I show that the value of information is approximately equal to the product of the mean cost of small deviations from the subtype optima and the variance of a modified distribution of the optimal behaviors. This helps to resolve the conflict between a result from economics, which shows that the value of information does not increase with the variance of subtypes, and results from theoretical behavioral ecology, which show that the effect of adding incomplete information to ""conventional"" models is greatest when the variance of subtypes is greatest. There is no conflict here as long as an increase in the variance of subtypes results in an increase in the variance of subtype optima, as is often the case.

The aim of the present series of experiments was to investigate whether such stimuli had potential for use as bird scarers. The starling ( Sturnus vulgaris ) was the subject species. The experimental procedure was designed to provide a relevant and objective, interval scale of aversiveness based upon the ability of eye patterns to deter hungry birds from a feeding area. Each subject was deprived of food for 5 h and then tested in an apparatus which exposed an eye pattern over a food trough immediately after the bird alighted on that trough. 10 measures of the starlings' feeding behaviour were monitored over a 1‐h trial. It was predicted that five of these variables would be positively and five negatively correlated with an increase in the fear evoking properties of the stimulus. The 10 measures were analysed using principal component analysis and the first component in every experiment had the signs of the latent vectors of the variables exactly in the predicted pattern and therefore appeared to be an ‘aversiveness index’. The scores from this first component were then used in a Latin square ANOVA to distinguish subject, test order and stimulus effects. The main findings from the eight experiments are as follows. Simple eye‐like patterns can indeed deter hungry starlings from feeding in their vicinity. The presence of a pair of eyes painted on a white card caused an 88% reduction in time spent on the nearby food trough and a 65% reduction in actual feeding time. The presence of ‘pupils’ in the patterns is essential for simple circles alone are not significantly more aversive than the control card. Once a pattern has the ‘pupil/iris’ distinction then a circular outline becomes important although the shape of the ‘pupil’ appears relatively unimportant. Eyes with coloured irises are more effective than black and white patterns but the degree of contrast between the ‘pupil’ and ‘iris’ appears irrelevant. Increasing the number of simultaneously presented eyes from one to three is correlated with an increasing trend in aversiveness which is destroyed if the same stimuli are presented within the context of a simple head outline. Changing the orientation of a pair of eyes from horizontal to vertical only slightly reduces their aversiveness. The size of the patterns appears to be unimportant within the range tested. The aversive properties of eyespots and of broadcast starling distress calls are positively additive. The effectiveness of a stimulus combining all the important features mentioned is as aversive as is a realistic model of the head of an owl.",W2001344653,False,0.7635675668716431

Based on evidence obtained from other vertebrate species, predominantly among the Primates, it was assumed that the facing orientation and direction of gaze of an adversary was the provocative agent eliciting gaze aversion by mouse lemurs. A more precise examination of the perceptual determinants of gaze aversion employed models presenting various combinations of eyelike concentric circles. Presented side-by-side in paired comparisons, it was predicted that a model presenting two horizontally placed concentric circles, which schematically resemble two facing eyes, would elicit less visual inspection, i.e., more visual avoidance, than models presenting less physiognomic arrangements of concentric circles. Using a special model-viewing apparatus, Experiment I examined the gaze behavior of 28 mouse lemurs in their peak activity period to determine the response-eliciting effectiveness of 5 models varying in the number of concentric circles. Experiment 2 examined 50 lemurs, some of which were in seasonally and artificially induced torpor. Three models differing in the spatial orientation of two concentric circles were investigated in an attempt to control for contour complexity. Both the bout frequency and duration of model fixation were measured using head orientation as the response criterion. The following results were obtained: 1. For the over-all paired comparisons in both experiments, the model presenting two horizontally positioned concentric circles was the only model which elicited significantly fewer bouts of longer fixation. 2. Because of a lack of homogeneity in model fixation, due to intense fear in some lemurs, the lemurs were separated into homogeneous subgroups using statistical criteria in the first experiment and behavioral criteria in the second. Only the largest subgroups comprising relatively calm mouse lemurs exhibited differential model fixation at a significant level. In both experiments, these particular subgroups looked significantly less at the critical model exhibiting two schematic facing eyes than at any of the other models. In conjunction with observations of dyadic interactions among mouse lemurs, the experimental findings suggest the following: 1. Two schematic facing eyes viewed out of context with a predator or conspecific are a provocative source of stimulation eliciting less visual inspection which could be considered analogous to bouts of gaze aversion observed among interacting lemurs. 2. In concordance with laboratory observations of attenuated gaze aversion by frightened mouse lemurs, the more fear-motivated lemurs in the present experiments exhibited reduced differential model inspection. The affinity between these findings implies, perhaps, that fear-motivation increases the tendency to engage in less selective investigative gazing as the animal shifts into a protective behavior mode. This as well as any other functional interpretation of the role of gaze behavior during agonistic encounters, however, awaits further experimental support.",W1969252173,False,0.714336097240448

https://doi.org/10.1086/284489,The Common Currency for Behavioral Decisions,"The study of optimal life histories involves the maximization of lifetime fitness but usually ignores the details of behavioral sequences. In contrast, the study of optimal behavioral sequences usually looks at the details of a sequence in isolation and not as part of the whole life history of the animal. The currency that is maximized is assumed to be related to lifetime fitness, but this relationship is rarely explored. In this paper we develop a common currency for behavioral decisions that is directly related to lifetime fitness. The common currency makes it possible to compare the benefits of qualitatively different behaviors. We show that many different costs can be used to explain a given behavioral sequence. Most of these costs have no biological interpretation. From these we single out a particular cost, the canonical cost, which measures the reduction in fitness that results from choosing a suboptimal action. Our general framework is illustrated by the example of a small bird in winter. We quantify the value of energy in terms of fitness and show how this value depends on energy reserves and time of day. As a result of this dependence, optimal foraging decisions depend on energy reserves and time of day, as does the optimal trade-off between foraging and looking around for predators.",W2009180034,False,0.8845816254615784

Die grosere Versuchsreihe lief im Zoologischen Institut der Universitat in Los Angeles, Kalifornien, eine kurzere im Max-Planck-Institut fur Verhaltensphysiologie, Seewiesen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, das die meisten Erwachsenen der untersuchten Arten in der Brutpflegephase arteigene Junge von artfremden unterscheiden konnen: eigene pflegen sie, fremde fressen sie auf. Innerhalb gewisser Grenzen nehmen sie arteigene Junge von anderen Eltern in ihre eigene Jungenschar auf. Die untersuchten Cichlasoma-Arten waren dabei weniger empfindlich gegen Altersunterschiede zwischen den Jungen als Hemichromis bimaculatus. Die Ergebnisse aus beiden Versuchsreihen unterscheiden sich im Hinblick auf das Anhalten der Brutbevorzugung. In der Hauptserie bevorzugten H. bimaculatus-Paare artfremde Brut, wenn man ihnen diese in ihrem ersten Brutzyklusstatt der eigenen unterschob; das gelang nicht bei den Cichlasoma-Arten. In Seewiesen zeigten Hemichromis-Eltern wenig oder gar keine anhaltende Bevorzugung. Nur pflegte H. fasciatus nie Cichlasoma-Eier, wenn er schon eigene gesehen hatte; auserdem scheint diese Art die Cichlasoma-Jungen nicht langer als 7 Tage nach dem Schlupfen zu pflegen, doch mus das an noch mehr Elternpaaren nachgepruft werden. Auch bei Cichlasoma fielen die Ergebnisse verschieden aus. In der Hauptserie nahmen beide Arten fremde Junge an, solange sie noch keine eigenen gepflegt hatten; danach lehnten viele Elternpaare fremde Junge ab. In Seewiesen hielt die Artbevorzugung bei vielen Paaren nicht an. Nach den Ergebnissen der Hauptserie zu urteilen hangt die Zuordnung der Brutpflegeaktionen zu den ausschlieslich arteigenen Jungen bei Hemichromis mehr als bei Cichlasoma von den mit der ersten Brut gesammelten Erfahrungen ab. Es wird wohl kaum einen Grund geben, diesen Vorrang der Objektfixierung nicht “Pragung” (bei Erwachsenen!) zu nennen. Die Unterschiede in diesem Vorgang gehen wahrscheinlich auf Unterschiede in den angeborenen Grenzen fur diejenigen Reize zuruck, die zur Objektfixierung taugen. Die Seewiesener Ergebnisse zeigen allerdings, das unter veranderten Versuchsbedingungen die Brutbevorzugung nicht bestehen zu bleiben braucht. Es wird erortert, welche Faktoren fur diese Variabilitat vermutlich verantwortlich sind.",W1528427359,False,0.5127497911453247

The nature of the response, and an examination of its course","The ‘chink ’ call given by chaffinches to non-flying predators can be used as an index of the intensity of the response. The response to predators thus provides suitable material for the quantitative study of certain aspects of instinctive behaviour. Before quantitative treatment can be attempted, however, a qualitative survey of the nature of the response is necessary. This paper contains such a survey, followed by an examination of the course of the response. The ‘mobbing’ response given to predators depends primarily on a conflict between tendencies to approach the predator and to flee from it; an investigatory response also plays a role. The movements made in mobbing are very similar to the intention movements of taking flight. Comparative study shows that the precise nature of the movements varies with the systematic position of the species concerned. The characters of owls which are important in the release of the mobbing response are analyzed. The recognition of many of these characters, including that of shape, seems to be inborn. The motor pattern of the response is also inborn. The behaviour does not appear until the bird is several weeks old: the nature of the maturation process is complex, and involves changes on both sensory and motor sides. The course of the response is described. Various characters of the response are selected for study, their variability examined, and some of the factors which control them investigated. Some of these characters vary independently of each other, so the features of the nervous mechanisms on which they depend must also be independently variable.",W1974282585,False,0.14380906522274017
