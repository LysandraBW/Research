    "# Trait-Mediated Interaction Modification\n",
    "# Empirical:\n",
    "# You could look for words like \"hypothesis\", \"experiment\", \"found\", and \"discovered\". That may point\n",
    "# towards there being an experiment in the paper. There are also words like \"control group\", \"compared\",\n",
    "# \"findings\", \"results\", \"study\", and more.\n",
    "# Qualitative vs. Quantitative:\n",
    "# To infer whether something is quantitative, you could look for numeric tokens and units.\n",
    "# However, you can only do so much with the abstract. Therefore, this is likely not good enough.\n",
    "# Yet, you could still take advantage of words like \"fewer\" and \"increased\" to show that there is a change.\n",
    "# However, this would be more suited for the above category.\n",
    "# Traits:\n",
    "# There is no NLP tool for traits that I can use or create so I think that I could instead use keywords.\n",
    "# For example, \"snail feeding rates\" is a trait. You may be able to spot this by looking for a word like\n",
    "# \"rate\". You'd expand that word to include \"snail feeding rates\". As \"snail\" is a species you can infer\n",
    "# that \"rates\" is a trait. I would be more decisive and use a dependency parser to ensure that the trait\n",
    "# is a property of the species (like before). However, with all the cases that may exist, I think checking\n",
    "# to see whether a species can be found by traveling back and/or forward without finding certain tokens could\n",
    "# work well enough.\n",
    "# 3 Species or More:\n",
    "# This is simple. However, I think using a dictionary and TaxoNerd would be beneficial (for higher accuracy).\n",
    "# To handle the potential differences in tokenization, character offsets should be used.\n",
    "# Standardization:\n",
    "# There is a lot of variance in the scores. To squash this issue, I think that we could assign each sentence\n",
    "# a value from 0 to 1. We would add these values and divide by the number of sentences. This would result in\n",
    "# a number that is also from 0 to 1. However, there are categories that we would like to inspect. So, we must\n",
    "# create an overall score in the interval from [0, 1] while also scoring each category. Well, for each sentence\n",
    "# we could add a point for each category that is observed. The sentence would receive said score divided by the\n",
    "# number of categories. At the end, we add up all the sentence scores and divide by the number of sentences.\n",
    "# The aggregate score for each category would also be divided by the number of sentences."

      "Title: Higher-Order Interaction between Species Inhibits Bacterial Invasion of a Phototroph-Predator Microbial Community\n",
      "Abstract: The composition of an ecosystem is thought to be important for determining its resistance to invasion. Studies of natural ecosystems, from plant to microbial communities, have found that more diverse communities are more resistant to invasion. In some cases, more diverse communities resist invasion by more completely consuming the resources necessary for the invader. We show that Escherichia coli can successfully invade cultures of the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (phototroph) or the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila (predator) but cannot invade a community where both are present. The invasion resistance of the algae-ciliate community arises from a higher-order interaction between species (interaction modification) that is unrelated to resource consumption. We show that the mode of this interaction is the algal inhibition of bacterial aggregation, which leaves bacteria vulnerable to predation. This mode requires both the algae and the ciliate to be present and provides an example of invasion resistance through an interaction modification.\n"
