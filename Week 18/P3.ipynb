    "# Trait-Mediated Interaction Modification\n",
    "# Empirical:\n",
    "# You could look for words like \"hypothesis\", \"experiment\", \"found\", and \"discovered\". That may point\n",
    "# towards there being an experiment in the paper. There are also words like \"control group\", \"compared\",\n",
    "# \"findings\", \"results\", \"study\", and more.\n",
    "# Qualitative vs. Quantitative:\n",
    "# To infer whether something is quantitative, you could look for numeric tokens and units.\n",
    "# However, you can only do so much with the abstract. Therefore, this is likely not good enough.\n",
    "# Yet, you could still take advantage of words like \"fewer\" and \"increased\" to show that there is a change.\n",
    "# However, this would be more suited for the above category.\n",
    "# Traits:\n",
    "# There is no NLP tool for traits that I can use or create so I think that I could instead use keywords.\n",
    "# For example, \"snail feeding rates\" is a trait. You may be able to spot this by looking for a word like\n",
    "# \"rate\". You'd expand that word to include \"snail feeding rates\". As \"snail\" is a species you can infer\n",
    "# that \"rates\" is a trait. I would be more decisive and use a dependency parser to ensure that the trait\n",
    "# is a property of the species (like before). However, with all the cases that may exist, I think checking\n",
    "# to see whether a species can be found by traveling back and/or forward without finding certain tokens could\n",
    "# work well enough.\n",
    "# 3 Species or More:\n",
    "# This is simple. However, I think using a dictionary and TaxoNerd would be beneficial (for higher accuracy).\n",
    "# To handle the potential differences in tokenization, character offsets should be used.\n",
    "# Standardization:\n",
    "# There is a lot of variance in the scores. To squash this issue, I think that we could assign each sentence\n",
    "# a value from 0 to 1. We would add these values and divide by the number of sentences. This would result in\n",
    "# a number that is also from 0 to 1. However, there are categories that we would like to inspect. So, we must\n",
    "# create an overall score in the interval from [0, 1] while also scoring each category. Well, for each sentence\n",
    "# we could add a point for each category that is observed. The sentence would receive said score divided by the\n",
    "# number of categories. At the end, we add up all the sentence scores and divide by the number of sentences.\n",
    "# The aggregate score for each category would also be divided by the number of sentences."

      "Title: Temperature dependency of intraguild predation between native and invasive crabs\n",
      "Abstract: Environmental factors such as temperature can affect the geographical distribution of species directly by exceeding physiological tolerances, or indirectly by altering physiological rates that dictate the sign and strength of species interactions. Although the direct effects of environmental conditions are relatively well studied, the effects of environmentally mediated species interactions have garnered less attention. In this study, we examined the temperature dependency of size-structured intraguild predation (IGP) between native blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus, the IG predator) and invasive green crabs (Carcinus maenas, the IG prey) to evaluate how the effect of temperature on competitive and predatory rates may influence the latitudinal distribution of these species. In outdoor mesocosm experiments, we quantified interactions between blue crabs, green crabs, and shared prey (mussels) at three temperatures reflective of those across their range, using two size classes of blue crab. At low temperatures, green crabs had a competitive advantage and IGP by blue crabs on green crabs was low. At high temperatures, size-matched blue and green crabs were competitively similar, large blue crabs had a competitive advantage, and IGP on green crabs was high. We then used parameter values generated from these experiments (temperature- and size-dependent attack rates and handling times) in a size-structured IGP model in which we varied IGP attack rate, maturation rate of the blue crab from the non-predatory to predatory size class, and resource carrying capacity at each of the three temperatures. In the model, green crabs were likely to competitively exclude blue crabs at low temperature, whereas blue crabs were likely to competitively and consumptively exclude green crabs at higher temperatures, particularly when resource productivities and rates of IGP were high. While many factors may play a role in delimiting species ranges, our results suggest that temperature-dependent interactions can influence local coexistence and are worth considering when developing mechanistic species distribution models and evaluating responses to environmental change.\n"
