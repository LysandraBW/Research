    "text = '''Only a fraction of the individuals in a given prey population are likely to be killed and consumed by predators. In contrast, nearly all individuals experience the chronic effects of predation risk. When threatened by predators, prey adopt defensive tactics whole costs can lead to reduced growth, maturation rates, survivorship, fecundity, or population density. This nonconsumptive impact of predation risk on prey is known as a \"trait-mediated interaction\" (TMI) because it results from changes in prey traits such as behavior or physiology. Ecological theory suggests that the strength of TMI effects will reflect a balance between the conflicting demands of reproduction vs. predator avoidance. Competitor density and resource availability are expected to alter the balance between these conflicting forces. We conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured TMI effect size while varying competitor and/or resource density. The threat of predation had an overall negative effect on prey performance, but the strength of this effect varied with the level of competition. High competition exacerbated the negative effect of intimidation on prey density but moderated the negative effect of intimidation on prey life history and growth. We discuss these results in light of previously published theoretical expectations. Our results highlight the variable and context-dependent nature of interspecific interactions.'''\n",

    "text = \"Current theory on trophic interactions in food webs assumes that ecologically similar species can be treated collectively as a single functional unit such as a guild or trophic level. This theory implies that all species within that unit transmit identical direct and indirect effects throughout the community. We evaluated this assumption by conducting experiments to compare the direct and indirect effects of three top-predator species, belonging to the same hunting spider guild, on the same species of grasshopper and on old-field grasses and herbs. Observations under field conditions revealed that each spider species exhibited different hunting behavior (i.e., sit-and-wait, sit-and-pursue, and active hunting) and occupied different locations within the vegetation canopy. These differences resulted in different direct effects on grasshopper prey. Grasshoppers demonstrated significant behavioral (diet) shifts in the presence of sit-and-wait and sit-and-pursue species but not when faced with actively hunting species. Grasshopper density was significantly reduced by spider species that occupied lower parts of the vegetation canopy (sit-and-pursue and actively hunting species), but it was not significantly reduced by the sit-and-wait spider species that occupied the upper parts of the canopy. These direct effects manifested themselves differently in the plant trophic level. The sit-and-wait spider caused indirect effects on plants by changing grasshopper foraging behavior (a trait-mediated effect). The sit-and-pursue spider caused indirect effects by reducing grasshopper density (density-mediated effects); the effects of changes in grasshopper behavior were thus not reflected in the plant trophic level. The actively hunting spiders had strictly density-mediated indirect effects on plants. The study offers mechanistic insight into how predator species within the same guild can have very different trophic effects in food webs. Thus classical modeling approaches that treat all predator species as a single functional unit may not adequately capture biologically relevant details that influence community dynamics.\"\n",

    "text = \"Diversity and plasticity are hallmarks of cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. In response to IFNs, Toll-like receptor engagement, or IL-4/IL-13 signaling, macrophages undergo M1 (classical) or M2 (alternative) activation, which represent extremes of a continuum in a universe of activation states. Progress has now been made in defining the signaling pathways, transcriptional networks, and epigenetic mechanisms underlying M1-M2 or M2-like polarized activation. Functional skewing of mononuclear phagocytes occurs in vivo under physiological conditions (e.g., ontogenesis and pregnancy) and in pathology (allergic and chronic inflammation, tissue repair, infection, and cancer). However, in selected preclinical and clinical conditions, coexistence of cells in different activation states and unique or mixed phenotypes have been observed, a reflection of dynamic changes and complex tissue-derived signals. The identification of mechanisms and molecules associated with macrophage plasticity and polarized activation provides a basis for macrophage-centered diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.\"\n",
