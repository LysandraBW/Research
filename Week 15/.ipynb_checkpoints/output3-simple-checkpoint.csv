Trophic cascades: the primacy of trait‐mediated indirect interactions,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2003.00560.x,"Abstract Trophic cascades are textbook examples of predator indirect effects on ecological systems. Yet there is considerable debate about their nature, strength and overall importance. This debate stems in part from continued uncertainty about the ultimate mechanisms driving cascading effects. We present a synthesis of empirical evidence in support of one possible ultimate mechanism: the foraging‐predation risk trade‐offs undertaken by intermediary species. We show that simple trade‐off behaviour can lead to both positive and negative indirect effects of predators on plant resources and hence can explain considerable contingency on the nature and strength of cascading effects among systems. Thus, predicting the sign and strength of indirect effect simply requires knowledge of habitat and resource use by prey with regard to predators’ presence, habitat use and hunting mode. The synthesis allows us to postulate a hypothesis for new conceptualization of trophic cascades which is to be viewed as an ultimate trade‐off between intervening species. In this context, different predators apply different rules of engagement based on their hunting mode and habitat use. These different rules then determine whether behavioural effects persist or attenuate at the level of the food chain."
TRAIT-MEDIATED INDIRECT EFFECTS IN LARVAL ANURANS: REVERSING COMPETITION WITH THE THREAT OF PREDATION,https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[2278:tmieil]2.0.co;2,"Ecologists recently have been focusing on the role that trait-mediated indirect effects can have on community structure and composition. To date, this work has primarily focused on the effects of predator-induced behavioral plasticity on communities. However, predator-induced morphological plasticity, which has been documented in many taxa, might also lead to trait-mediated indirect effects. Here, I examined how predators altered the behavior and morphology of larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and leopard frogs (R. pipiens) and how these phenotypic changes altered the outcome of competition between the two species. Competition in the absence of caged predators was asymmetric; when reared separately, leopard frogs grew more than wood frogs, but when competing (without predators), wood frogs grew faster than leopard frogs. The presence of caged predators reversed the outcome of competition between the two anuran prey. In the presence of larval dragonflies (Anax spp.) or caged mudminnows (Umbra limi), leopard frogs grew faster than wood frogs while total tadpole biomass production remained unchanged. Thus, there was a predator-mediated indirect effect. Because predators alter both the behavior and morphology of larval anurans and both of these traits are known to affect resource consumption and growth, both are potential mechanisms to explain the change in competitive outcome. Changes in behavior were not related to changes in growth, but changes in morphology (specifically mouth width and tail length) were related to changes in growth. When competitors were added (without predators), wood frogs increased their mouth width by 10% and their tail length by 3%, while leopard frogs increased their mouth width by 5% and did not change their tail length. The greater increase in mouth width for wood frogs should increase their forage intake, since tadpoles feed by scraping periphyton; the importance of a 3% longer tail in competitive ability is unknown. The presence of the predator threat (via chemical cues from the caged predators) reduced both the mouth width and tail length in the two prey species to pre-competition levels. This response corresponded with the reduced competitive ability of the wood frogs. This work demonstrates that both competitors and predators can alter prey morphology and suggests that changes in morphology can cause trait-mediated indirect effects."
Parasitism in a community context: trait‐mediated interactions with competition and predation,https://doi.org/10.1890/09-1697.1,"Predation and competition can induce important density- and trait-mediated effects on species, with implications for community stability. However, interactions of these factors with parasitism remain understudied. Here we investigate interactions among competition, predation and parasitism by crossing tadpole density (Bufo americanus), presence of a caged predator (Notophthalmus viridescens), and Echinostoma trivolvis trematodes, experimentally partitioning their effects on tadpole exposure and susceptibility to infection. Predation did not affect E. trivolvis infection but accelerated tadpole development and growth, and decreased activity. The presence of E. trivolvis caused the opposite effects on these three responses and reduced tadpole survival. High conspecific density reduced tadpole survival, growth, and development, and increased tadpole activity. Effects of predation and parasitism on activity were only evident at low tadpole density. High-density mesocosms also had twice the number of E. trivolvis infections as low-density mesocosms, despite a lack of evidence for stress-induced immunomodulation. Instead, this effect was explained by high density delaying tadpole development, which increased both the duration of exposure to cercariae and susceptibility to infection, because tadpoles spent more time in highly susceptible early stages. These results highlight the importance of accounting for trait-mediated effects, host plasticity, and exposure vs. susceptibility in parasite ecology."
RESOURCE COMPETITION MODIFIES THE STRENGTH OF TRAIT-MEDIATED PREDATOR–PREY INTERACTIONS: A META-ANALYSIS,https://doi.org/10.1890/04-1249,"Only a fraction of the individuals in a given prey population are likely to be killed and consumed by predators. In contrast, nearly all individuals experience the chronic effects of predation risk. When threatened by predators, prey adopt defensive tactics whose costs can lead to reduced growth, maturation rates, survivorship, fecundity, or population density. This nonconsumptive impact of predation risk on prey is known as a ""trait-mediated interaction"" (TMI) because it results from changes in prey traits such as behavior or physiology. Ecological theory suggests that the strength of TMI effects will reflect a balance between the conflicting demands of reproduction vs. predator avoidance. Competitor density and resource availability are expected to alter the balance between these conflicting forces. We conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured TMI effect size while varying competitor and/or resource density. The threat of predation had an overall negative effect on prey performance, but the strength of this effect varied with the level of competition. High competition exacerbated the negative effect of intimidation on prey density but moderated the negative effect of intimidation on prey life history and growth. We discuss these results in light of previously published theoretical expectations. Our results highlight the variable and context-dependent nature of interspecific interactions."
TRAIT-MEDIATED EFFECTS IN ROCKY INTERTIDAL FOOD CHAINS: PREDATOR RISK CUES ALTER PREY FEEDING RATES,https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0629:tmeiri]2.0.co;2,"The influence of predation on rocky intertidal community structure has long emphasized the importance of indirect interactions. Most efforts in this area have focused on the density-mediated, or lethal effects, of predators on prey density. Recently, there has been growing interest in trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs): the presence of a predator in the environment influences the interaction between two other species (prey and their resource) by altering a trait of the prey species. For example, waterborne cues released by predators can cause changes in prey species behavior, such as feeding rates, thereby altering the impact of the prey species on their resources. Thus, TMIIs represent the nonlethal effects of predators that contrast with the more traditional emphasis on lethal indirect effects. Marine ecologists are just beginning to explore the role of TMIIs in their systems. We examined whether risk cues released by a ubiquitous crab predator (Carcinus maenas) influence the abundance of two dominant species in the rocky intertidal zone (barnacles [Semibalanus balanoides] and fucoid algae [Ascophyllum nodosum]) by altering the behavior of two of its snail prey (Nucella lapillus and Littorina littorea). We found that the presence of green crab risk cues can have strong cascading indirect effects on the abundance of barnacles and fucoid algae. N. lapillus exposed to risk cues consumed up to 29% fewer barnacles compared to conspecifics feeding in the absence of risk cues, whereas L. littorea exposed to risk cues consumed 459% fewer fucoids compared to conspecifics feeding in the absence of risk cues. These cascading interactions appear to reflect suppression of snail feeding by predator risk cues. In both food chains, snails exhibited more refuge-seeking behavior and grew less in the presence of risk cues. Our experiments suggest that TMIIs may have an important and underappreciated influence on species interactions that shape community dynamics on rocky intertidal shores. Corresponding Editor: P. T.

Habitat Choice and Phenotype‐Limited Feeding Efficiency in Bluegill: Individual Differences and Trophic Polymorphism,https://doi.org/10.2307/1937360,"Individual variation in the foraging behavior of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) was studied in laboratory aquaria containing vegetated and open water habitats. In general fish chose to search for prey in the habitat that provided the highest foraging return, but individuals differed markedly in the degree of habitat selection. Vegetation and open water habitats require different searching techniques for efficient prey detection and individual bluegill differed in their levels of behavioral adjustment to each habitat. Fish using slower searching tactics had the highest foraging rates in the vegetation, whereas individuals searching rapidly fed more effectively in the open water. These behavioral differences in searching rates were found to be correlated with the size of the pectoral fins. Bluegill with longer pectoral fins consistently searched more slowly and spent more time in the vegetation habitat compared to bluegill with shorter pectoral fins. These results indicate that behavioral and morphological variation among individuals can influence habitat—specific feeding efficiency and habitat selection, and may also have direct consequences for models of density— and frequency—dependent habitat selection."

Fearing the feline: domestic cats reduce avian fecundity through trait‐mediated indirect effects that increase nest predation by other species,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12025,"Summary Urban areas contain high densities of non‐native species, which in the UK include the domestic cat F elis catus ( L innaeus 1758) and the grey squirrel S ciurus carolinensis ( G melin 1788). The direct predation effects of domestic cats on prey populations attract intense debate, and such influences of the nest‐predatory grey squirrel are receiving increasing attention. In contrast, theory predicts that sublethal and indirect effects are more important, but empirical evidence is currently lacking. We conducted controlled model presentation experiments at active urban blackbird T urdus merula ( L innaeus 1758) nests to provide the first empirical evidence that quantifies the potential sublethal and indirect effects of predators (domestic cat and grey squirrel) on avian reproductive success. Domestic cat models reduced subsequent parental provisioning rates, a strong indicator of sublethal effects, by one‐third relative to a nonpredatory rabbit O ryctolagus cuniculus ( L innaeus 1758) control. There was no compensatory increase in food load size. Previous experiments demonstrate that this magnitude of reduced food delivery will reduce nestling growth rates by c. 40%. The grey squirrel model induced similar but weaker effects. Following the brief presence of the domestic cat model, subsequent daily nest predation rates, chiefly by corvids, increased by an order of magnitude relative to the squirrel and rabbit models. The intensity of parental nest defence elicited in response to model presentations predicts the probability of such third‐party predator predation events, and the domestic cat model generated significant increases in nest defence behaviour. Synthesis and applications. The brief presence of a domestic cat at avian nest sites reduces subsequent provisioning rates and induces lethal trait‐mediated indirect effects. We provide the first robust evidence for these latter effects in any avian predator–prey system, although they are likely to be common in many avian assemblages with high predator densities. It is imperative that future assessments of the impact of predatory species on avian prey species take lethal trait‐mediated indirect effects into account, as so doing will prevent biased estimates of predator effects and facilitate the design of more effective control strategies. Full mitigation of the sublethal and indirect effects of domestic cats would problematically require permanent indoor housing."

TRAIT-MEDIATED INDIRECT EFFECTS OF A THERIDIID SPIDER ON AN ANT-PLANT MUTUALISM,https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[1066:tmieoa]2.0.co;2,"Indirect effects associated with the spider Dipoena banksii, a predator of ants, are identified within the context of the ant-plant mutualism between Pheidole bicornis and Piper obliquum. Pheidole bicornis can detect D. banksii webs and avoid leaves occupied by the spider. In a field manipulation, plants with spiders suffered significantly more folivory than plants without spiders. Because the increase in folivory is associated with a modification of ant behavior, the effect of the spiders is proposed as an example of a trait-mediated indirect interaction."
Cascading trait-mediation: disruption of a trait-mediated mutualism by parasite-induced behavioral modification,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2010.17985.x,"Trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMII) are important driving-forces causing trophic cascades in aquatic and terrestrial food webs. Furthermore, since most biological communities are not simple food chains but complex networks of interactions, one TMII within a community might easily be influenced by another TMII. In other words, TMII themselves can be cascades with potential implications for community dynamics. Here we report on one of such cascade, where a parasitic fly induces behavioral changes that disrupt a trait-mediated ant–hemipteran mutualism. We show that during parasite-induced low-activity periods, the ant Azteca instabilis fails to protect its mutualistic scale-insect partner against predatory ladybeetles. Thus, in the presence of the parasite, ladybeetles ate as many scales in ant-patrolled plants as they did in ant-free plants. These results demonstrate how, through a cascade of trait-mediated interactions, associations between members of a community can be drastically altered."
Susceptibility to Predation Affects Trait-Mediated Indirect Interactions by Reversing Interspecific Competition,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0023068,"Numerous studies indicate that the behavioral responses of prey to the presence of predators can have an important role in structuring assemblages through trait-mediated indirect interactions. Few studies, however, have addressed how relative susceptibility to predation influences such interactions. Here we examine the effect of chemical cues from the common shore crab Carcinus maenas on the foraging behavior of two common intertidal gastropod molluscs. Of the two model consumers studied, Littorina littorea is morphologically more vulnerable to crab predation than Gibbula umbilicalis, and it exhibited greater competitive ability in the absence of predation threat. However, Littorina demonstrated a greater anti-predator response when experimentally exposed to predation cues, resulting in a lower level of foraging. This reversed the competitive interaction, allowing Gibbula substantially increased access to shared resources. Our results demonstrate that the susceptibility of consumers to predation can influence species interactions, and suggest that inter-specific differences in trait-mediated indirect interactions are another mechanism through which non-consumptive predator effects may influence trophic interactions."

Relative strengths of trait‐mediated and density‐mediated indirect effects of a predator vary with resource levels in a freshwater food chain,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13869.x,"Predators can affect the density and traits (e.g. morphology, behavior) of their prey, and either change may influence how prey interact with their resources. Thus, predators can interact indirectly with resource species (i.e. two trophic levels below) through two separate mechanisms. The relative strengths of these two kinds of indirect effects have rarely been compared directly, and how their relative importance varies across environmental gradients is virtually unknown. We investigated the relative strength of trait‐ and density‐mediated indirect effects of the predatory insect Belostoma flumineum on algal communities through predation on the pond snail, Physa gyrina, across a gradient of basal resource abundance. Because prey balance the benefits of foraging against the increased risk of predation while foraging, the availability of the prey's resource should influence the strength of anti‐predator behavioral responses and hence the strength of trait‐mediated indirect interactions. Belostoma presence had positive indirect effects on resources as expected and total predator effects were constant across the basal resource gradient. At low initial resource levels, trait‐mediated indirect effects on algal biomass exceeded density‐mediated indirect effects, while at high initial resources the reverse was true. Snails showed similar habitat use across the resource gradient suggesting that the anti‐predator response was most likely a depression of activity levels."
Trait‐mediated apparent competition in an intraguild predator–prey system,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00937.x,"Apparent competition is of broad interest due to its effects on community structure and potential applications in agriculture, restoration, and medicine. It is well‐established that apparent competition can result from changes in predator abundance or behavior caused by interactions with alternate prey, but no previous empirical study has demonstrated that apparent competition can also result from prey‐induced changes in predator morphology. This trait‐mediated alternative mechanism of apparent competition would expand the range of conditions under which apparent competition might occur in nature and identify new ways to generate or modify apparent competition in applied contexts. Here, as a proof of concept, we show that trait‐mediated apparent competition can arise from inducible offenses and show how it operates using experiments involving three ciliates. When it feeds on Colpidium kleini, the intraguild predator Tetrahymena vorax increases in size to the extent that it can then consume Paramecium aurelia, an even larger prey. When feeding only on bacteria, however, Tetrahymena remains smaller and is unable to consume Paramecium. This trait‐mediated indirect effect leads to the predatory exclusion of Paramecium, while Tetrahymena and Colpidium coexist. Developmental expansions such as those underlying the interactions observed in our study are not limited to ciliates, such as Tetrahymena, but occur among many diverse taxa and may have a surprising degree of influence over the structure and dynamics of food webs."
Density‐ and trait‐mediated effects of a parasite and a predator in a tri‐trophic food web,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12317,"Summary Despite growing interest in ecological consequences of parasitism in food webs, relatively little is known about effects of parasites on long‐term population dynamics of non‐host species or about whether such effects are density or trait mediated. We studied a tri‐trophic food chain comprised of (i) a bacterial basal resource ( S erratia fonticola ), (ii) an intermediate consumer ( P aramecium caudatum ), (iii) a top predator ( D idinium nasutum ) and (iv) a parasite of the intermediate consumer ( H olospora undulata ). A fully factorial experimental manipulation of predator and parasite presence/absence was combined with analyses of population dynamics, modelling and analyses of host ( P aramecium ) morphology and behaviour. Predation and parasitism each reduced the abundance of the intermediate consumer ( P aramecium ), and parasitism indirectly reduced the abundance of the basal resource ( S erratia ). However, in combination, predation and parasitism had non‐additive effects on the abundance of the intermediate consumer, as well as on that of the basal resource. In both cases, the negative effect of parasitism seemed to be effaced by predation. Infection of the intermediate consumer reduced predator abundance. Modelling and additional experimentation revealed that this was most likely due to parasite reduction of intermediate host abundance (a density‐mediated effect), as opposed to changes in predator functional or numerical response. Parasitism altered morphological and behavioural traits, by reducing host cell length and increasing the swimming speed of cells with moderate parasite loads. Additional tests showed no significant difference in D idinium feeding rate on infected and uninfected hosts, suggesting that the combination of these modifications does not affect host vulnerability to predation. However, estimated rates of encounter with S erratia based on these modifications were higher for infected Paramecium than for uninfected P aramecium. A mixture of density‐mediated and trait‐mediated indirect effects of parasitism on non‐host species creates rich and complex possibilities for effects of parasites in food webs that should be included in assessments of possible impacts of parasite eradication or introduction."
Trait‐mediated effects of predation across life‐history stages in container mosquitoes,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2011.01302.x,"1. It was determined if the predatory midge Corethrella appendiculata Grabham imposes a fitness cost in a native mosquito, Ochlerotatus triseriatus Say, and an invasive mosquito, Aedes albopictus Skuse. The hypothesis that decreased activity of immature prey in the presence of predator cues is associated with life history costs through all life cycle stages was tested. 2. In experiment 1, individual larvae of O. triseriatus or A. albopictus were raised in the presence or absence of predation cues at two resource levels. Prey were video recorded to detect behavioural responses and to measure development time, size at emergence, and adult longevity. In experiment 2, prey populations were reared in similar environments and the frequency of predator cue additions was varied. 3. Only O. triseriatus reduced its activity in the presence of predation cues. Predation cues were associated with longer immature development times and shorter adult life spans in O. triseriatus, whereas in A. albopictus, the cues were associated with a larger size of emerging adults. 4. In the present study, it was found that behavioural modifications during the larval stage can affect mosquitoes through multiple stages of their complex life cycle. The species‐specific behavioural differences are probably attributable to the longer evolutionary history O. triseriatus has with predators, relative to the invasive A. albopictus."
"Trait‐mediated seed predation, dispersal and survival among frugivore‐dispersed plants in a fragmented subtropical forest, Southwest China",https://doi.org/10.1111/1749-4877.12046,"By tracking the fate of individual seeds from 6 frugivore-dispersed plants with contrasting seed traits in a fragmented subtropical forest in Southwest China, we explored how rodent seed predation and hoarding were influenced by seed traits such as seed size, seed coat hardness and seed profitability. Post-dispersal seed fates varied significantly among the 6 seed species and 3 patterns were witnessed: large-seeded species with a hard seed coat (i.e. Choerospoadias axillaries and Diospyros kaki var. silvestris) had more seeds removed, cached and then surviving at caches, and they also had fewer seeds predated but a higher proportion of seeds surviving at the source; medium-sized species with higher profitability and thinner seed coat (i.e. Phoebe zhennan and Padus braohypoda) were first harvested and had the lowest probability of seeds surviving either at the source or at caches due to higher predation before or after removal; and small-seeded species with lower profitability (i.e. Elaeocarpus japonicas and Cornus controversa) had the highest probability of seeds surviving at the source but the lowest probability of seeds surviving at caches due to lower predation at the source and lower hoarding at caches. Our study indicates that patterns of seed predation, dispersal and survival among frugivore-dispersed plants are highly determined by seed traits such as seed size, seed defense and seed profitability due to selective predation and hoarding by seed-eating rodents. Therefore, trait-mediated seed predation, dispersal and survival via seed-eating rodents can largely affect population and community dynamics of frugivore-dispersed plants in fragmented forests."

Top predators suppress rather than facilitate plants in a trait-mediated tri-trophic cascade,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2011.0166,"Classical ecological theory states that in tri-trophic systems, predators indirectly facilitate plants by reducing herbivore densities through consumption, while more recent work has revealed that predators can generate the same positive effect on plants non-consumptively by inducing changes in herbivore traits (e.g. feeding rates). Based on observations in US salt marshes dominated by vast monocultures of cordgrass, we hypothesized that sit-and-wait substrate-dwelling predators (crabs) could actually strengthen per capita impacts of potent grazers (snails), by non-consumptively inducing a vertical habitat shift of snails to their predation refuge high on canopy leaves that are vulnerable to grazing. A two-month field experiment supported this hypothesis, revealing that predators non-consumptively increased the mean climbing height of snails on grasses, increased grazing damage per leaf and ultimately suppressed cordgrass biomass, relative to controls. While seemingly counterintuitive, our results can be explained by (i) the vulnerability of refuge resources to grazing, and (ii) universal traits that drove the vertical habitat shift—i.e. relative habitat domains of predator and prey, and the hunting mode of the top predator. These results underline the fact that not only should we continue to incorporate non-consumptive effects into our understanding of top-down predator impacts, but we should do so in a spatially explicit manner."
Trait-mediated trophic cascade creates enemy-free space for nesting hummingbirds,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1500310,"The indirect effects of predators on nonadjacent trophic levels, mediated through traits of intervening species, are collectively known as trait-mediated trophic cascades. Although birds are important predators in terrestrial ecosystems, clear examples of trait-mediated indirect effects involving bird predators have almost never been documented. Such indirect effects are important for structuring ecological communities and are likely to be negatively impacted by habitat fragmentation, climate change, and other factors that reduce abundance of top predators. We demonstrate that hummingbirds in Arizona realize increased breeding success when nesting in association with hawks. An enemy-free nesting space is created when jays, an important source of mortality for hummingbird nests, alter their foraging behavior in the presence of their hawk predators."
Performance Consequences of a Trophic Polymorphism: Feeding Behavior in Typical and Cannibal Phenotypes of Ambystoma tigrinum,https://doi.org/10.2307/1446142,"Aquatic feeding behavior, prey capture performance, and morphological aspects of the feeding mechanism were compared in typical and cannibal phenotypes of Ambystoma tigrinum melanostictum to test the hypothesis that the trophic polymorphism affords a performance advantage in feeding. Similar-sized salamanders of the two phenotypes differed morphologically in size of the vomerine tooth patches and head width but not in size of the gape or mass of the hyoid retractor muscles used in suction feeding. Suction feeding and prey handling performance did not differ between the two morphs feeding on live guppies or small conspecific salamanders. However, differences were found in willingness to feed on conspecifics and prey handling performance when feeding on larger salamander larvae. Thus, cannibal morphs possess a significant performance advantage only during predation on large conspecifics. The performance advantage on large prey appears to be a consequence of greater prey handling ability facilitated by the increased size of the vomerine tooth patches."
Trait-Mediated Effects of Parasitic Phorid Flies (Diptera: Phoridae) on Ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) Competition and Resource Access in Coffee Agro-ecosystems,https://doi.org/10.1603/0046-225x(2005)034[1089:teoppf]2.0.co;2,"Predator effects on prey traits change competitive interactions between prey species affecting resource use. Parasitic phorid flies limit competitive-dominant ant activity, potentially meditating competitive interactions between ant species, changing competitive hierarchies, or affecting ant communities. I considered interactions between phorids (Pseudacteon sp.), their ant host (Azteca instabilis F. Smith), and co-occurring ant species in coffee agro-ecosystems testing whether phorids (1) limit A. instabilis recruitment activity, (2) affect competitive interaction between ant species, and (3) are associated with other species' resource access and therefore have the potential to change competitive hierarchies. I monitored recruitment of A. instabilis and other ants to baits over 90 min on canopy trees with or without phorids. A. instabilis were one-half as abundant with phorids. Other species gained access to baits 12 times more often and were only able to take over baits when phorids were present. Furthermore, many more species (13 versus 2) gained access to resources when phorids were present. These results indicate that phorids mediate competitive interactions between ant species and may influence ant communities by affecting resource availability. Considering that phorids limit A. instabilis attacks on herbivores and that ant species differ in effects on arthropod communities, phorids may have strong community-level effects in coffee agro-ecosystems."
Fish predators reduce kelp frond loss via a trait‐mediated trophic cascade,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2380,"Abstract Although trophic cascades were originally believed to be driven only by predators eating prey, there is mounting evidence that such cascades can be generated in large part via non‐consumptive effects. This is especially important in cascades affecting habitat‐forming foundation species that in turn, influence associated communities. Here, we use laboratory and field experiments to identify a trait‐mediated indirect interaction between predators and an abundant kelp in a marine temperate reef system. Predation risk from a microcarnivorous fish, the señorita, suppressed grazing by the host‐specific seaweed limpet, which in turn, influenced frond loss of the habitat‐forming feather boa kelp. This trophic cascade was pronounced because minor amounts of limpet grazing decreased the strength required to break kelp fronds. Cues from fish predators mitigated kelp loss by decreasing limpet grazing; we found 86% of this indirect interaction between predator and kelp was attributed to the non‐consumptive effect in the laboratory and 56% when applying the same effect size calculations to the field. In field manipulations, the non‐consumptive effect of señorita was as strong as the total predator effect and most importantly, as strong as the uncaged, “open” treatment with natural levels of predators. Our findings demonstrate that the mere presence of this fish reduces frond loss of the feather boa kelp through a trait‐mediated trophic cascade. Moreover, despite large volumes of water, current flow, and wave energy, we clearly demonstrate a strong non‐consumptive effect via an apparent chemical cue from señorita, suggesting that chemically mediated trait‐driven cascades may be more prevalent in subtidal marine systems than we are currently aware."

Maternal Investment Influences Expression of Resource Polymorphism in Amphibians: Implications for the Evolution of Novel Resource-Use Phenotypes,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0009117,"Maternal effects--where an individual's phenotype is influenced by the phenotype or environment of its mother--are taxonomically and ecologically widespread. Yet, their role in the origin of novel, complex traits remains unclear. Here we investigate the role of maternal effects in influencing the induction of a novel resource-use phenotype. Spadefoot toad tadpoles, Spea multiplicata, often deviate from their normal development and produce a morphologically distinctive carnivore-morph phenotype, which specializes on anostracan fairy shrimp. We evaluated whether maternal investment influences expression of this novel phenotype. We found that larger females invested in larger eggs, which, in turn, produced larger tadpoles. Such larger tadpoles are better able to capture the shrimp that induce carnivores. By influencing the expression of novel resource-use phenotypes, maternal effects may play a largely underappreciated role in the origins of novelty."
Apolipoprotein E polymorphism determined by restriction enzyme analysis of DNA amplified by polymerase chain reaction: convenient alternative to phenotyping by isoelectric focusing,https://doi.org/10.1093/clinchem/36.12.2087,"Three common alleles determine six apolipoprotein E (apo E) phenotypes that are associated with variations in serum cholesterol in the population. This genetic variation results from single nucleotide alterations at two DNA loci encoding the amino acid residues 112 and 158 of apo E. We compared results of apo E phenotyping carried out by isoelectric focusing with those of apo E genotyping accomplished by direct DNA analysis. In the latter, the target DNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequently analyzed by digestion with the restriction enzyme Hha I, followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the cleavage products. With one exception, these two techniques yielded similar results from all 40 samples tested. In addition, a rare variant form of apo E (phenotype E1) was analyzed separately and incorrectly diagnosed as E2 by the Hha I digestion method; the anticipated mutation in the codon 127 was, however, confirmed by demonstration of a new Taq I restriction site in this variant gene. These data confirm that the common isoforms of apo E usually arise from genetic variation of the codons 112 and 158 and demonstrate the feasibility of the PCR technique in apo E genotyping."
Trait‐mediated foraging drives patterns of selective predation by native and invasive coral‐reef fishes,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2752,"Abstract As the geographic ranges of species are increasingly altered by forces such as biological invasion and climate change, when and where will strong biotic interactions arise within reassembling communities? Prey selectivity data are often of limited use for predicting future consumptive interactions because they are specific to the identity and relative abundance of species in past assemblages. Here, we investigate whether the strength of consumptive interactions can be predicted based on a priori knowledge of behavioral traits that are hypothesized to affect the predation process and recur across species. To test this approach, we conducted multi‐species foraging trials with coral‐reef fishes in the Bahamas, a diverse, trait‐rich fauna for which interactions are likely shifting rapidly due to the introduction of predatory Indo‐Pacific lionfish. We evaluated predictions about the combined effects of three behavioral traits—water column position of both predator and prey, anti‐predator aggregation behavior of prey, and hunting strategy of predators—on successive phases of the predation process and ultimately the strength of predator–prey interactions. Tracking predator and prey behaviors revealed that inter‐specific variation in traits mediated relative encounter, attack, and capture rates between different predators and prey. Behaviorally driven bottlenecks at different stages of the process underpinned selective consumption by each predator species, resulting in large differences in total mortality rates among prey species. Our analysis also suggests that unique behaviors exhibited by invasive lionfish, rather than naïve responses by prey, mediate their high foraging success relative to native predators. Our results illustrate how incorporating a priori knowledge about foraging and anti‐predator traits can improve predictions of the strength of emergent consumptive interactions caused by global change."
Resource‐ and pollinator‐mediated selection on floral traits,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12757,"Summary Female reproductive success is predicted to be simultaneously limited by the availability of pollen and resources. Selection on floral traits results from both factors, but their relative importance and interaction is poorly understood. We increased nutrient and pollen availability of the orchid Dactylorhiza lapponica in a factorial experiment to quantify resource‐ and pollinator‐mediated selection on floral traits. Hand‐pollination increased female fitness (number of fruits × mean fruit mass) by 74% in both nutrient treatments, whereas nutrient addition did not significantly affect female fitness. There was selection for more flowers and longer spurs, and selection on spur length was significantly pollinator‐mediated and of similar strength across nutrient treatments (Δβ poll = 0·54 and Δβ poll_ NPK = 0·59). There was no statistically significant resource‐mediated selection. Nutrient addition increased flower size the following year, but did not affect flower or fruit production, or selection on any trait. The results demonstrate that D. lapponica does not increase flower production in response to nutrient addition, that the increase in female fitness in response to hand‐pollination is not resource limited, and suggest that natural resource variation does not influence selection on floral traits. The study illustrates that crossed manipulations of pollen and resources can clarify their relative importance for selection on floral traits. A Lay Summary is available for this article."
Aphid symbionts and endogenous resistance traits mediate competition between rival parasitoids,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180729,"Insects use endogenous mechanisms and infection with protective symbionts to thwart attacks from natural enemies. Defenses that target specific enemies, however, potentially mediate competition between rivals and thereby impact community composition. Following its introduction to North America to control pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum), the parasitoid Aphidius ervi competitively displaced other parasitoids, except for the native Praon pequodorum. The pea aphid exhibits tremendous clonal variation in resistance to A. ervi, primarily through infection with the heritable bacterial symbiont Hamiltonella defensa, although some symbiont-free aphid genotypes encode endogenous resistance. Interestingly, H. defensa strains and aphid genotypes that protect against A. ervi, provide no protection against the closely related, P. pequodorum. Given the specificity of aphid defenses, we hypothesized that aphid resistance traits may contribute to the continued persistence of P. pequodorum. We conducted multiparasitism assays to determine whether aphid resistance traits mediate internal competition between these two solitary parasitoid species, but found this was not the case; P. pequodorum was the successful internal competitor across lines varying in susceptibility to A. ervi. Next, to determine whether resistance traits influence competitive interactions resulting in the stable persistence of P. pequodorum, we established replicated cages varying in the proportion of resistant aphids and recorded successful parasitism for each wasp species over time. As expected, A. ervi outcompeted P. pequodorum in cages containing only susceptible aphids. However, P. pequodorum not only persisted, but was the superior competitor in populations containing any proportion (20–100%) of resistant aphids (20–100%). Smaller scale, better replicated competition cage studies corroborated this finding, and no-competition and behavioral assays provide insight into the processes mediating competition. Genetic variation, including that acquired via infection with protective symbionts, may provide a supply of hosts susceptible only to particular enemies, mediating competition with effects on community richness and stability."
How Do Trait-Mediated Non-lethal Effects of Predation Affect Population-Level Performance of Mosquitoes?,https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2019.00025,"Non-lethal, trait-mediated effects of predation impact prey behavior and life-history traits. Studying how these effects in turn influence prey demography is crucial to understand prey life-history evolution. Mosquitoes are important vectors that claim several million lives every year worldwide by transmitting a range of pathogens. Several ecological factors affect life-history traits of both larval and adult mosquitoes, creating effects that cascade to population-level consequences. Few studies have comprehensively explored the non-lethal effects of predation and its interactions with resources and competition on larval, adult, and population traits of mosquitoes. Understanding these interactions is important because the effects of predation are hypothesized to rescue prey populations from the effects of density-dependence resulting from larval competition. Aedes aegypti larvae reared at two different larval densities and subjected to three non-lethal predator treatments were monitored for survival, development time, and adult size through the larval stages to adult eclosion, and adult females were monitored for survival and reproduction through their first gonotrophic cycle. Intraspecific competition increased larval development time, yielded small-bodied adults, and reduced fecundity in individuals exposed to predatory chemical cues as larvae. Exposure to cues from a living predator affected both body size and latency to blood feed in females. Analysis of life-table traits revealed significant effects of competition on net reproductive rate (R0) of mosquitoes. The interaction between competition and predator treatments significantly affected the cohort rate of increase (r) and the index of performance (r'). The index of performance, which estimates rate of population change based on the size-fecundity relationship, was significantly and positively correlated with r, but overestimated r slightly. Lack of significant effect of predator treatments and larval density on cohort generation time (Tc) further suggests that the observed effects of treatments on r and r' were largely a consequence of the effects on R0. Also, the significant effects of treatment combinations on larval development time, adult body size and fecundity were ultimately manifested as effects on life-table traits estimated from adult survival and reproduction."

Moving beyond linear food chains: trait-mediated indirect interactions in a rocky intertidal food web,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2016.2590,"In simple, linear food chains, top predators can have positive indirect effects on basal resources by causing changes in the traits (e.g. behaviour, feeding rates) of intermediate consumers. Although less is known about trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) in more complex food webs, it has been suggested that such complexity dampens trophic cascades. We examined TMIIs between a predatory crab ( Carcinus maenas ) and two ecologically important basal resources, fucoid algae ( Ascophyllum nodosum ) and barnacles ( Semibalanus balanoides ), which are consumed by herbivorous ( Littorina littorea ) and carnivorous ( Nucella lapillus ) snails, respectively. Because crab predation risk suppresses snail feeding rates, we hypothesized that crabs would also shape direct and indirect interactions among the multiple consumers and resources. We found that the magnitude of TMIIs between the crab and each resource depended on the suite of intermediate consumers present in the food web. Carnivorous snails ( Nucella ) transmitted TMIIs between crabs and barnacles. However, crab–algae TMIIs were transmitted by both herbivorous ( Littorina ) and carnivorous ( Nucella ) snails, and these TMIIs were additive. By causing Nucella to consume fewer barnacles, crab predation risk allowed fucoids that had settled on or between barnacles to remain in the community. Hence, positive interactions between barnacles and algae caused crab–algae TMIIs to be strongest when both consumers were present. Studies of TMIIs in more realistic, reticulate food webs will be necessary for a more complete understanding of how predation risk shapes community dynamics."

Predation risk in tadpole populations shapes behavioural responses of prey but not strength of trait‐mediated indirect interactions,https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.01488,"Prey animals often respond to predators by reducing activity levels. This can produce a trait‐mediated indirect interaction (TMII) between predators and prey resources, whereby reduced foraging by prey in the presence of a predator causes an increase in prey resources. TMIIs play important roles in structuring communities, and it is important to understand factors that determine their strength. One such influence may be behavioural variation in the prey species, with indirect effects of predators being stronger within populations that are more responsive to the presence of a predator. We tested 1) whether the behavioural responsiveness of populations of wood frog tadpoles to predator cues was related to the predation risk in their native ponds, and 2) whether more responsive tadpoles yielded stronger TMIIs. To do this, we 1) measured the activity of tadpoles from 18 populations in mesocosms with and without caged predators, and 2) measured changes in the biomass of periphyton (the tadpoles’ diet) between predator treatments for each population. We found that tadpoles from higher predation risk ponds reduced their time outside refuges more in the presence of predators and tended to move less when visible, suggesting possible local adaptation to predation regimes. Though the presence of predators generally resulted in higher periphyton biomass – a TMII – there was no evidence that the strength of this TMII was affected by variation in tadpole behaviour. Foraging activity and general activity may be decoupled to some extent, enabling high predation risk‐adapted tadpoles to limit the fitness costs of reduced foraging when predators are present."
Trait-Mediated Effects of Parasitic Phorid Flies (Diptera: Phoridae) on Ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) Competition and Resource Access in Coffee Agro-ecosystems,https://doi.org/10.1093/ee/34.5.1089,"Predator effects on prey traits change competitive interactions between prey species affecting resource use. Parasitic phorid flies limit competitive-dominant ant activity, potentially meditating competitive interactions between ant species, changing competitive hierarchies, or affecting ant communities. I considered interactions between phorids (Pseudacteon sp.), their ant host (Azteca instabilis F. Smith), and co-occurring ant species in coffee agro-ecosystems testing whether phorids (1) limit A. instabilis recruitment activity, (2) affect competitive interaction between ant species, and (3) are associated with other species' resource access and therefore have the potential to change competitive hierarchies. I monitored recruitment of A. instabilis and other ants to baits over 90 min on canopy trees with or without phorids. A. instabilis were one-half as abundant with phorids. Other species gained access to baits 12 times more often and were only able to take over baits when phorids were present. Furthermore, many more species (13 versus 2) gained access to resources when phorids were present. These results indicate that phorids mediate competitive interactions between ant species and may influence ant communities by affecting resource availability. Considering that phorids limit A. instabilis attacks on herbivores and that ant species differ in effects on arthropod communities, phorids may have strong community-level effects in coffee agro-ecosystems."
Trait-Mediated Indirect Effects in Larval Anurans: Reversing Competition with the Threat of Predation,https://doi.org/10.2307/177114,"Ecologists recently have been focusing on the role that trait-mediated indirect effects can have on community structure and composition. To date, this work has primarily focused on the effects of predator-induced behavioral plasticity on communities. However, predator-induced morphological plasticity, which has been documented in many taxa, might also lead to trait-mediated indirect effects. Here, I examined how predators altered the behavior and morphology of larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and leopard frogs (R. pipiens) and how these phenotypic changes altered the outcome of competition between the two species. Competition in the absence of caged predators was asymmetric; when reared separately, leopard frogs grew more than wood frogs, but when competing (without predators), wood frogs grew faster than leopard frogs. The presence of caged predators reversed the outcome of competition between the two anuran prey. In the presence of larval dragonflies (Anax spp.) or caged mudminnows (Umbra limi), leopard frogs grew faster than wood frogs while total tadpole biomass production remained unchanged. Thus, there was a predator-mediated indirect effect. Because predators alter both the behavior and morphology of larval anurans and both of these traits are known to affect resource consumption and growth, both are potential mechanisms to explain the change in competitive outcome. Changes in behavior were not related to changes in growth, but changes in morphology (specifically mouth width and tail length) were related to changes in growth. When competitors were added (without predators), wood frogs increased their mouth width by 10% and their tail length by 3%, while leopard frogs increased their mouth width by 5% and did not change their tail length. The greater increase in mouth width for wood frogs should increase their forage intake, since tadpoles feed by scraping periphyton; the importance of a 3% longer tail in competitive ability is unknown. The presence of the predator threat (via chemical cues from the caged predators) reduced both the mouth width and tail length in the two prey species to pre-competition levels. This response corresponded with the reduced competitive ability of the wood frogs. This work demonstrates that both competitors and predators can alter prey morphology and suggests that changes in morphology can cause trait-mediated indirect effects."
Investment into Defensive Traits by Anuran Prey (Lithobates pipiens) Is Mediated by the Starvation-Predation Risk Trade-Off,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0082344,"Prey can invest in a variety of defensive traits when balancing risk of predation against that of starvation. What remains unknown is the relative costs of different defensive traits and how prey reconcile investment into these traits when energetically limited. We tested the simple allocation model of prey defense, which predicts an additive effect of increasing predation risk and resource availability, resulting in the full deployment of defensive traits under conditions of high risk and resource saturation. We collected morphometric, developmental, and behavioural data in an experiment using dragonfly larvae (predator) and Northern leopard frog tadpoles (prey) subject to variable levels of food availability and predation risk. Larvae exposed to food restriction showed limited response to predation risk; larvae at food saturation altered behaviour, development, and growth in response to predation risk. Responses to risk varied through time, suggesting ontogeny may affect the deployment of particular defensive traits. The observed negative correlation between body size and activity level for food-restricted prey--and the absence of a similar response among adequately-fed prey--suggests that a trade-off exists between behavioural and growth responses when energy budgets are limited. Our research is the first to demonstrate how investment into these defensive traits is mediated along gradients of both predation risk and resource availability over time. The interactions we demonstrate between resource availability and risk level on deployment of inducible defenses provide evidence that both internal condition and extrinsic risk factors play a critical role in the production of inducible defenses over time."

Spore traits mediate disturbance effects on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community composition and mutualisms,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.4016,"Trait-based approaches in ecology are powerful tools for understanding how organisms interact with their environment. These approaches show particular promise in disturbance and community ecology contexts for understanding how disturbances like prescribed fire and bison grazing influence interactions between mutualists like arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and their plant hosts. In this work we examined how disturbance effects on AM fungal spore community composition and mutualisms were mediated by selection for specific functional spore traits at both the species and community level. We tested these questions by analyzing AM fungal spore communities and traits from a frequently burned and grazed (bison) tallgrass prairie system and using these spores to inoculate a plant growth response experiment. Selection for darker, pigmented AM fungal spores, changes in the abundance and volume of individual AM fungal taxa, and altered sporulation, were indicators of fire and grazing effects on AM fungal community composition. Disturbance associated changes in AM fungal community composition were then correlated with altered growth responses of Schizachyrium scoparium grass. Our work shows that utilization of trait-based approaches in ecology can clarify the mechanisms that underly belowground responses to disturbance, and provide a useful framework for understanding interactions between organisms and their environment."
Species-Specific Traits Rather Than Resource Partitioning Mediate Diversity Effects on Resource Use,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007423,"Background The link between biodiversity and ecosystem processes has firmly been established, but the mechanisms underpinning this relationship are poorly documented. Most studies have focused on terrestrial plant systems where resource use can be difficult to quantify as species rely on a limited number of common resources. Investigating resource use at the bulk level may not always be of sufficient resolution to detect subtle differences in resource use, as species-specific nutritional niches at the biochemical level may also moderate diversity effects on resource use. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we use three co-occurring marine benthic echinoderms (Brissopsis lyrifera, Mesothuria intestinalis, Parastichopus tremulus) that feed on the same phytodetrital food source, to determine whether resource partitioning is the principal mechanism underpinning diversity effects on resource use. Specifically we investigate the use of phytodetrital pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) because many of these are essential for biological functions, including reproduction. Pigments were identified and quantified using reverse-phase high performance liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and data were analysed using a combination of extended linear regression with generalised least squares (GLS) estimation and standard multivariate techniques. Our analyses reveal no species-specific selectivity for particular algal pigments, confirming that these three species do not partition food resources at the biochemical level. Nevertheless, we demonstrate increased total resource use in diverse treatments as a result of selection effects and the dominance of one species (B. lyrifera). Conclusion Overall, we found no evidence for resource partitioning at the biochemical level, as pigment composition was similar between individuals, which is likely due to plentiful food availability. Reduced intra-specific competition in the species mixture combined with greater adsorption efficiency and differences in feeding behaviour likely explain the dominant use of resources by B. lyrifera."
Bottom‐up and trait‐mediated effects of resource quality on amphibian parasitism,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12613,"Abstract Leaf litter subsidies are important resources for aquatic consumers like tadpoles and snails, causing bottom‐up effects on wetland ecosystems. Recent studies have shown that variation in litter nutritional quality can be as important as litter quantity in driving these bottom‐up effects. Resource subsidies likely also have indirect and trait‐mediated effects on predation and parasitism, but these potential effects remain largely unexplored. We generated predictions for differential effects of litter nutrition and secondary polyphenolic compounds on tadpole ( L ithobates sylvatica ) exposure and susceptibility to R ibeiroia ondatrae, based on ecological stoichiometry and community‐ecology theory. We predicted direct and indirect effects on key traits of the tadpole host (rates of growth, development and survival), the trematode parasite (production of the cercaria infective stages) and the parasite's snail intermediate host (growth and reproduction). To test these predictions, we conducted a large‐scale mesocosm experiment using a natural gradient in the concentrations of nutrients (nitrogen) and toxic secondary compounds (polyphenolics) of nine leaf litter species. To differentiate between effects on exposure vs. susceptibility to infection, we included multiple infection experiments including one with constant per capita exposure. We found that increased litter nitrogen increased tadpole survival, and also increased cercaria production by the snail intermediate hosts, causing opposing effects on tadpole per capita exposure to trematode infection. Increased litter polyphenolics slowed tadpole development, leading to increased infection by increasing both their susceptibility to infection and the length of time they were exposed to parasites. Based on these results, recent shifts in forest composition towards more nitrogen‐poor litter species should decrease trematode infection in tadpoles via density‐ and trait‐mediated effects on the snail intermediate hosts. However, these shifts also involve increased abundance of litter species with high polyphenolic levels, which should increase trematode infection via trait‐mediated effects on tadpoles. Future studies will be needed to determine the relative strength of these opposing effects in natural wetland communities.

Native fruit traits may mediate dispersal competition between native and non-native plants,https://doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.12.2357,"Seed disperser preferences may mediate the impact of invasive, non-native plant species on their new ecological communities. Significant seed disperser preference for invasives over native species could facilitate the spread of the invasives while impeding native plant dispersal. Such competition for dispersers could negatively impact the fitness of some native plants. Here, we review published literature to identify circumstances under which preference for non-native fruits occurs. The importance of fruit attraction is underscored by several studies demonstrating that invasive, fleshy-fruited plant species are particularly attractive to regional frugivores. A small set of studies directly compare frugivore preference for native vs. invasive species, and we find that different designs and goals within such studies frequently yield contrasting results. When similar native and non-native plant species have been compared, frugivores have tended to show preference for the non-natives. This preference appears to stem from enhanced feeding efficiency or accessibility associated with the non-native fruits. On the other hand, studies examining preference within existing suites of co-occurring species, with no attempt to maximize fruit similarity, show mixed results, with frugivores in most cases acting opportunistically or preferring native species. A simple, exploratory meta-analysis finds significant preference for native species when these studies are examined as a group. We illustrate the contrasting findings typical of these two approaches with results from two small-scale aviary experiments we conducted to determine preference by frugivorous bird species in northern California. In these case studies, native birds preferred the native fruit species as long as it was dissimilar from non-native fruits, while non-native European starlings preferred non-native fruit. However, native birds showed slight, non-significant preference for non-native fruit species when such fruits were selected for their physical resemblance to the native fruit species. Based on our review and case studies, we propose that fruit characteristics of native plant communities could dictate how well a non-native, fleshy-fruited plant species competes for dispersers with natives. Native bird preferences may be largely influenced by regional native fruits, such that birds are attracted to the colors, morphology, and infructescence structures characteristic of preferred native fruits. Non-native fruits exhibiting similar traits are likely to encounter bird communities predisposed to consume them. If those non-natives offer greater fruit abundance, energy content, or accessibility, they may outcompete native plants for dispersers."

"A multifaceted trophic cascade in a detritus‐based system: density‐, trait‐, or processing‐chain‐mediated effects?",https://doi.org/10.1890/es14-00365.1,"We investigated three pathways by which predators on an intermediate trophic level may produce a trophic cascade in detritus‐based systems. Predators may increase lower trophic levels (bacteria) by reducing density of bacteriovores, by altering behavior of bacteriovores, and by processing living bacteriovores into carcasses, feces, and dissolved nutrients that are substrates for bacteria. We tested these pathways in laboratory experiments with mosquitoes in water‐filled containers. Larval Toxorhynchites rutilus prey on larval Aedes triseriatus, which feed on bacteria. Using containers stocked with oak leaf infusion as a bacterial substrate, we compared bacterial productivity at 7 and 14 days for: prey alone; prey with a predator; and prey with predation cues but no predator. Controls contained no larvae, either with predation cues or without cues. Predation cues in the control treatment increased bacterial abundance at 7 days, but this effect waned by 14 days. Aedes triseriatus larvae reduced bacterial abundance significantly at 14 days. Predator cues and real predation both eliminated the negative effect of A. triseriatus on bacterial abundance. Predation cues reduced survivorship of A. triseriatus larvae at 14 days, however this effect was smaller than the effect of real predation. We further tested effects of residues from predation as cues or as detritus in a second experiment in which A. triseriatus were killed at similar rates by: real predators ; mechanical damage without the predator and carcasses left as detritus; or mechanical damage and carcasses removed. No prey larvae were killed in controls. Bacterial productivity was greater with real predation than in all other treatments and greater when prey larvae were killed or killed and removed, than in controls. Thus we find evidence that all three pathways contribute to the trophic cascade from T. rutilus to bacteria in tree hole systems."

Mistletoe generates non‐trophic and trait‐mediated indirect interactions through a shared host of herbivore consumers,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2564,"Abstract Indirect interactions emerge among a wide range of herbivores sharing the same plant resource. Consumers usually belong to different trophic guilds, from folivores and sapsuckers to parasitic plants. We propose that mistletoes parasitizing pines could play a key role acting as herbivores on host pines and coming indirectly into competition with other herbivores feeding on the same host. Changes caused by mistletoes on its host have been well studied, but its effects running across trophic webs remain unrevealed. In this study, we investigate the effect of European mistletoe ( Viscum album subsp. austriacum ) on the host‐feeding herbivores via trait‐mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) across their shared pine host ( Pinus nigra subsp. salzmannii ). We performed field and laboratory experiments, and analyzed the net effect of different mistletoe parasite loads on three host‐phytophagous species: the sapsucker Cinara pini (Aphididae), the winter folivore Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Thaumetopoeidae), and the summer folivore Brachyderes sp. (Curculionidae), all being members of different functional feeding groups (FFGs). We summarize the mistletoe–host–herbivore interactions by means of a TMII, where mistletoe parasitism causes non‐trophic links and detrimental indirect interactions on pine‐feeding herbivores across its shared host, suggesting a worsening of host quality as food. These indirect interactions vary according to three parameters. First, the intensity has a non‐proportional relation with parasite load, showing an impact threshold on highly parasitized pines. Second, the movement capacity of insect herbivores determines their response, by decreasing the abundance of herbivores with low movement ability (aphids and pine processionary caterpillars) while altering the behavior (plant selection) of more mobile herbivores (pine weevils). Finally, FFG determines the intensity of mistletoe parasitism effects, folivores being more responsive than sapsuckers. Overall, mistletoe generates non‐trophic interaction linkages in the forest able to modify community structure by becoming a nexus of the entire herbivore community of the pine canopy."
Neurotic Personality Traits and Risk for Adverse Alcohol Outcomes: Chained Mediation through Emotional Disorder Symptoms and Drinking to Cope,https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2018.1432647,"Background: Rates of alcohol abuse are high on Canadian postsecondary campuses. Individual trait differences have been linked to indices of alcohol use/misuse, including neurotic traits like anxiety sensitivity (AS) and hopelessness (HOP). We know little, though, about how these traits confer vulnerability. AS and HOP are related to anxiety and depression, respectively, and to drinking to cope with symptoms of those disorders. Neurotic personality may therefore increase risk of alcohol use/abuse via (1) emotional disorder symptoms and/or (2) coping drinking motives. Objectives: Allan and colleagues (2014) found chained mediation through AS-generalized anxiety-coping motives-alcohol problems and AS-depression-coping motives-alcohol problems. We sought to expand their research by investigating how emotional disorder symptoms (anxiety, depression) and specific coping motives (drinking to cope with anxiety, depression) may sequentially mediate the AS/HOP-to-hazardous alcohol use/drinking harms relationships among university students. Methods: This study used cross-sectional data collected in Fall 2014 as part of the Movember-funded Caring Campus Project (N = 1,883). The survey included the SURPS, adapted DMQ-R SF, and AUDIT-3. Results: AS and HOP were both related to hazardous alcohol and drinking harms via emotional disorder symptoms and, in turn, coping drinking motives.

Differential vulnerability to predation in two sympatric whelks is mediated by juvenile traits,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7410.2012.00274.x,"Abstract In many taxa, initial differences in offspring size play an important role in mediating subsequent performance; however, the consequences of interspecific variation in size for the performance of co‐occurring taxa have been rarely examined. We used the whelks C ominella virgata and C. maculosa, which co‐occur on rocky shores throughout their life cycles, to examine the vulnerability of early life‐stages to native predators under controlled laboratory conditions. Among all the predators evaluated (the cushion sea star P atiriella spp., the olive rockfish A canthoclinus fuscus, the oyster borer snail H austrum scobina, the smooth shore crab C yclograpsus lavauxi, and the pebble crab H eterozius rotundifrons ), hatchlings of both species ( C. virgata : ~3 mm shell length [ SL ] and C. maculosa : ~1.5 mm SL ) were especially vulnerable to the smooth shore crab C y. lavauxi, the only potential predator in which mortality was greater than in the control treatment. Small shore crabs (~8 mm carapace width [ CW ]) were unable to eat hatchlings of either whelk species, whereas medium and large shore crabs (~12 and ~18 mm CW, respectively) consumed hatchlings of both prey species. Hatchlings of C. virgata were less vulnerable to predation by medium crabs than large ones, and those of C. maculosa were equally vulnerable to both sizes of crabs. In hatchlings of both prey species, shell length and shell thickness increased over time. Two months after hatching, only individuals of C. virgata had reached a size refuge from predation. Our results show that interspecific vulnerability to predators can be mitigated by larger sizes and thicker shells at hatching; nonetheless, our results also suggest that other species‐specific factors, such as juvenile growth rate, may also play key roles in determining the vulnerability of hatchling and juvenile snails to shell‐crushing predators."

Predation yields greater population performance: what are the contributions of density‐ and trait‐mediated effects?,https://doi.org/10.1111/een.12940,"1. Population responses to extrinsic mortality can yield no change in number of survivors (compensation) or an increase in number of survivors (overcompensation) when the population is regulated by negative density-dependence. This intriguing response has been the subject of theoretical studies, but few experiments have explored how the source of extrinsic mortality affects the response. 2. This study tests abilities of three functionally diverse predators, alone and combined, to induce (over)compensation of a prey population. Larval Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) were exposed to predation by Mesocyclops longisetus (Crustacea: Copepoda), Anopheles barberi (Diptera: Culicidae), Corethrella appendiculata (Diptera: Corethrellidae), all three in a substitutive design, or no predation. 3. The number of survivors to adulthood, female size and development time, and a composite index of performance (r') were analysed. Predator treatment did not have a significant effect on total number of survivors, nor on number of males, suggesting mortality by predation was compensatory. Predation significantly affected number of female survivors, with a trend of more females produced with predation, though no post hoc tests were significant. Predation significantly increased female development rate and r' relative to no-predator control. 4. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the change in the number of female adults produced was the largest contributing factor to the differences in r' among cohorts. While predation did not significantly increase overall production of adults, it did release survivors from density-dependent effects sufficiently to increase population performance.

For instance, many assess the importance of environmental filtering versus classical limiting-similarity competition in driving biological invasions by examining whether invaders’ traits are similar or dissimilar to those of residents, respectively. However, mounting evidence suggests that hierarchical differences between species' trait values can distinguish their competitive abilities (e.g. for the same resource) instead of their niches. Whether such trait-mediated hierarchical competition explains invasions and structures assemblages is less explored. We integrate morphological, dietary, physiological and behavioural trait analyses to test whether environmental filtering, limiting-similarity competition or hierarchical competition explain invasions by fire ants on ant assemblages. We detect both competition mechanisms; invasion success is not only explained by limiting similarity in body size and thermal tolerance (presumably allowing the invader to exploit different niches from residents), but also by the invader's superior position in trait hierarchies reflecting competition for common trophic resources. We find that the two mechanisms generate complex assemblage-level functional diversity patterns—overdispersion in some traits, clustering in others—suggesting their effects are likely missed by analyses restricted to a few traits and composite trait diversity measures."
Trait-Mediated Indirect Effects of a Theridiid Spider on an Ant-Plant Mutualism,https://doi.org/10.2307/177039,"Indirect effects associated with the spider Dipoena banksii, a predator of ants, are identified within the context of the ant-plant mutualism between Pheidole bicornis and Piper obliquum. Pheidole bicornis can detect D. banksii webs and avoid leaves occupied by the spider. In a field manipulation, plants with spiders suffered significantly more folivory than plants without spiders. Because the increase in folivory is associated with a modification of ant behavior, the effect of the spiders is proposed as an example of a trait-mediated indirect interaction."

The results show that both extraversion and conscientiousness have positive total effect on students' academic achievements, and they are mainly realized through the chain mediating effects of self-efficacy and major identity to self-efficacy, and are mainly based on self-efficacy mediating effect, which is more obvious in the dimension of behavioral efficacy. Openness also affects academic achievement through a self-efficacy mediating effect and major identity to self-efficacy chain mediating effect, but the degree of influence is weak, and the total effect is not significant; the overall effect of agreeableness personality on academic achievement is negative, and it is mainly reflected through direct effect.

The role of trait-mediated indirect interactions for multispecies plant–animal mutualisms,https://doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511736551.018,"Organisms experience myriad interactions with both antagonists and mutualists. There is widespread recognition that these multispecies interactions are not independent and that community membership can have important consequences for host fitness as well as patterns of natural selection (Strauss and Irwin 2004; Morris et al. 2007). For example, herbivore feeding can influence plant interactions with other herbivores or mutualists (e.g., pollinators), which can have subsequent effects on host plant fitness (Karban and Baldwin 1997; Mothershead and Marquis 2000; Strauss et al. 2001). Moreover, traits involved in these multispecies interactions can represent an adaptive compromise due to host interactions with antagonists and mutualists (Galen and Cuba 2001). While the effects of antagonist–antagonist and antagonist–mutualist interactions on hosts have received attention from both theoreticians and empiricists, the ecological and evolutionary consequences of host interactions with multiple mutualists have received less study (Hoeksema and Bruna 2000). That the study of multispecies mutualisms has lagged behind other suites of multispecies interactions is not surprising, given that mutualisms in general receive less study than competition and predation (Bronstein 1994). However, because many species interact with multiple mutualists either simultaneously or sequentially throughout their lifetimes (Janzen 1985) and mutualisms can have powerful impacts on host fitness and evolution (Bronstein et al. 2006), it is germane to ask how these multispecies mutualisms affect the ecology and evolution of their shared hosts (also see Stanton 2003)."
Pathogenic fungus causes density‐ and trait‐mediated trophic cascades in an aquatic community,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4043,"Abstract Pathogens can alter species composition and ecosystem function by causing direct and indirect effects on communities. Zoospores of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (hereafter, Bd), a pathogen implicated in worldwide amphibian declines, can be consumed by filter‐feeding zooplankton and can damage mouthparts of infected amphibian larvae. Consequently, we hypothesized that this pathogen would affect the abundance of zooplankton and survival and feeding abilities of larval amphibian hosts. In turn, this could affect the algal food resources of zooplankton and tadpoles, which can include phytoplankton and periphyton. We tested these hypotheses by manipulating the presence of western toad ( Anaxyrus boreas ) larvae and Bd in outdoor mesocosms and quantifying the densities of amphibians, zooplankton, phytoplankton, and periphyton. Bd infections reduced amphibian larval densities, but this only weakly benefitted periphyton (a density‐mediated indirect effect). After controlling for larval densities, mesocosms with Bd‐exposed larvae had significantly more periphyton biomass than mesocosms with larvae but no Bd, consistent with infection‐induced mouthpart damage reducing larval feeding rates on attached algae (a trait‐mediated indirect effect). In fact, the estimated trait‐mediated effect of Bd on periphyton biomass was larger than the density‐mediated effect. However, we did not find evidence that Bd exposure triggered a switch to filter‐feeding phytoplankton. The presence of Bd was associated with increased copepod abundance, consistent with zooplankton consuming chytrid zoospores. These results suggest that Bd has the potential to cause both trait‐ and density‐mediated indirect effects that can alter community composition and perhaps the primary productivity of freshwater ecosystems."
Local adaptation in trait-mediated trophic cascades,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2023.2583,"Predator-induced changes in prey foraging can influence community dynamics by increasing the abundance of basal resources via a trait-mediated trophic cascade. The strength of these cascades may be altered by eco-evolutionary relationships between predators and prey, but the role of basal resources has received limited attention. We hypothesized that trait-mediated trophic cascade strength may be shaped by selection from trophic levels above and below prey. Field and laboratory experiments used snails ( Nucella lapillus ) from two regions in the Gulf of Maine (GoM) that vary in basal resource availability (e.g. mussels), seawater temperature, and contact history with the invasive green crab, Carcinus maenas. In field and laboratory experiments, Nucella from both regions foraged on mussels in the presence or absence of green crab risk cues. In the field, Nucella from the northern GoM, where mussels are scarce, were less responsive to risk cues and more responsive to seawater temperature than southern Nucella. In the lab, however, northern Nucella foraged and grew more than southern snails in the presence of risk, but foraging and growth were similar in the absence of risk. We suggest that adaptation to basal resource availability may shape geographical variation in the strength of trait-mediated trophic cascades."
Trait‐mediated indirect effect involving a chain of learning in agroecosystems,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.70046,"Abstract An increase in predation risk triggers a trait response of prey, which alters the interactions between the prey and other species, ultimately affecting other species in the ecosystem. Such predator‐driven trait‐mediated indirect effects (TMIEs) may have been shaped by long‐term evolutionary processes involving the organisms involved, but learning may also be important, especially in contemporary ecosystems experiencing repeated biological invasions. The apple snail Pomacea canaliculata is an important introduced pest of rice, Oryza sativa. Recently, the carrion crow Corvus corone has been found to prey on this species only in some areas, suggesting that learning is involved in this predation. In addition, apple snails can learn to escape from predators and exhibit predator‐specific responses. Thus, the “chain of learning” by the crow and the snail may shape novel TMIEs in the rice ecosystem. We conducted field and mesocosm experiments to test this hypothesis. In the field experiment, we simulated predation by crows in rice fields and investigated the behavior of apple snails. The snails exhibited escape behaviors in response to the simulated predation, and both the proportion of individuals showing the escape response and the degree of escape response were greater in fields with predation by crows than those without predation. In the mesocosm experiment, apple snails from fields with and without predation by crows were separately introduced into mesocosms simulating rice fields, and the behaviors of the snails and the number of remaining rice plants were recorded for 16 days at three levels of predation risk (daily, every 4 days, or no predation). Both the presence/absence of predation in the collection fields and simulated predation affected the escape responses of the snails. Moreover, damage to rice was more severe in mesocosms containing snails from fields without predation than those containing snails from fields with predation. These results suggest that the “chain of learning” causes TMIEs in agroecosystems."

Detection of the Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor Gene Pvuii Intron 15 Polymorphism Using the Polymerase Chain Reaction: Association With Plasma Lipid Traits in Healthy Men and Women,https://doi.org/10.1155/1998/842051,"We have used anchored PCR to amplify and sequence 1400 bp of the 15th intron of the Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene, and have determined oligonucleotides and conditions for the genotyping of the previously reported PvuII polymorphism. The cutting site (CAGCTG) is created by the transition of a CpG to a TpG within the sequence CAGCCG at a position roughly 600 bp 5' from the splice acceptor site of exon 16. Genotype was determined in three population-based samples of healthy individuals. In a group of 318 men and women from Iceland the frequencies of the Intron-15 T (cutting) allele was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.19-0.28) and was similar in men and women. In two groups of men from England (n = 385) and Scotland (n = 320), the frequency was similar, being 0.23 (0.19-0.27) and 0.25 (0.22-0.28) respectively. Individuals who were homozygous for the T allele had lower levels of total-cholesterol triglycerides and apolipoprotein B, than those with other genotypes, and in the combined group of UK men this effect reached statistical significance; compared to the C/C group, the T/T group had 6% lower cholesterol (p = 0.02) and 15% lower triglycerides (p = 0.03). The lowering effect associated with the T/T genotype was greater in men who were in the lowest tertile of body mass index (< 25 kg/m2) and for the trait of apoB levels, this genotype x obesity interaction was statistically significant (p = 0.01). We thus confirm the association between this allele and lower levels of plasma lipid levels previously reported. The availability of a PCR-based method to detect this polymorphism will facilitate further investigation of the impact of LDL-receptor gene variation in determining lipid levels."

Tri-trophic interactions in tropical ecosystems may follow different patterns from temperate ecosystems due to differences in above abiotic and biotic conditions. We sampled leaf-chewing larvae of Lepidoptera (caterpillars) from a dominant host tree species in a seasonal rainforest in Southwest China. We reared out parasitoids and grouped herbivores based on their diet preferences, feeding habits and defence mechanisms. We compared caterpillar abundance with leaf numbers ('bottom-up' effects) and parasitoid abundance ('top-down' effects) between different seasons and herbivore traits. We found bottom-up effects were stronger than top-down effects. Both bottom-up and top-down effects were stronger in the dry season than in the wet season, which were driven by polyphagous rare species and host plant phenology. Contrary to our predictions, herbivore traits did not influence differences in the bottom-up or top-down effects except for stronger top-down effects for shelter-builders. Our study shows season is the main predictor of the bottom-up and top-down effects in the tropics and highlights the complexity of these interactions."

Two SNPs that encode S503P and Q576R in the intracytoplasmic domain of the receptor are associated with loss or gain of function, respectively. We investigated the frequency of these SNPs and their association with traits of allergic asthma in 36 unrelated subjects selected from a racially admixed, clinically ascertained study population with family histories of asthma. The frequency of the 1682 T to C substitution that encodes S503P was 0.11 (70 alleles analyzed, from 29 TT homozygotes and 6 TC heterozygotes).

Alternative trait combinations and secondary resource partitioning in sexually selected color polymorphism,https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.610,"Resource partitioning within a species, trophic polymorphism is hypothesized to evolve by disruptive selection when intraspecific competition for certain resources is severe. However, in this study, we reported the secondary partitioning of oviposition resources without resource competition in the damselfly Ischnura senegalensis. In this species, females show color polymorphism that has been evolved as counteradaptation against sexual conflict. One of the female morphs is a blue-green (andromorph, male-like morph), whereas the other morph is brown (gynomorph). These female morphs showed alternative preferences for oviposition resources (plant tissues); andromorphs used fresh (greenish) plant tissues, whereas gynomorphs used decaying (brownish) plants tissues, suggesting that they chose oviposition resources on which they are more cryptic. In addition, the two-color morphs had different egg morphologies. Andromorphs have smaller and more elongated eggs, which seemed to adapt to hard substrates compared with those of gynomorphs. The resource partitioning in this species is achieved by morphological and behavioral differences between the color morphs that allow them to effectively exploit different resources. Resource partitioning in this system may be a by-product of phenotypic integration with body color that has been sexually selected, suggesting an overlooked mechanism of the evolution of resource partitioning. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary and ecological consequences of such resource partitioning."

The influence of big five personality traits on anxiety: The chain mediating effect of general self-efficacy and academic burnout,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0295118,"Background As an important factor affecting personal health, anxiety has always been valued by people. Prior research has consistently shown that personality traits is associated with anxiety level,but little is known about the inner mechanism of this relationship. To fill the gap, the present research aims to explore the chain mediating role of general self-efficacy and academic burnout in the relationship between big five personality and anxiety. Methods This cross-sectional study was performed from September to November 2022. Self-reported questionnaires including the Big Five Personality Questionnaire, General Self-Efficacy Scale, College Student’s academic burnout Scale, Generalized Anxiety Scale and demographic characteristics were distributed to 2505 college students in a university in Hebei Province, of which 2,471 were valid. Statistical analysis was carried out through SPSS26.0 and SPSS PROCESS macro. Results Results showed four of the big five personality characters (i.e., extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness) were negatively correlated with anxiety. Neuroticism was positively correlated with anxiety. Moreover, general self-efficacy was found to be negatively correlated with academic burnout and anxiety; academic burnout was positively correlated with anxiety. Finally, general self-efficacy and academic burnout mediated the relationship between personality traits (i.e., extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness) and anxiety. Conclusions Personality traits (i.e., extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism, and openness) could influence anxiety through the chain mediating effects of general self-efficacy and academic burnout. Interventions focusing on anxiety reduction may be successful in increasing general self-efficacy and decreasing students’ academic burnout."
Shell Traits of a Marine Mussel Mediate Predation Selectivity by Crabs and Sea Stars,https://doi.org/10.2983/035.028.0211,"Crabs and sea stars are known to preferentially select mussels with morphological traits that diminish the predators' searching or handling times. I compared two distinct morphotype of mussels (Mytilus trossulus; Gould, 1850) from Howe Sound, British Columbia, Canada, by dissection and measurement. Then, I experimentally offered mussels of the two morphotypes on the same patch to crabs (Cancer productus; Randall, 1839) and sea stars (Pisaster ochraceus; Brandt, 1835) to quantify the extent to which these predators select prey based on morphological features. Sea stars preferentially consumed mussels with gaps in shell closures, although these mussels also had larger adductor muscles compared with mussels rejected. Gaps at the shell margin presumably allowed sea stars easier access between shell valves to insert their stomachs and begin digestion. Small crabs preferentially consumed mussels with thin shells, which are easier to crush, whereas, large crabs consumed more thick-shelled mussels, possibly because these mussels were larger and offered greater energetic return. However, overall, crabs and sea stars did not exhibit strong preferences for smaller or larger mussel prey. These findings indicate that morphological features of mussels are important in prey selection by crab and sea star predators. Predator selectivity could cause a trade-off in defense strategies in mussels, and ultimately mediate indirect effects between these predators in the rocky intertidal community."

Discovery and trait association of single nucleotide polymorphisms from gene regions of influence on meat tenderness and long-chain omega-3 fatty acid content in Australian lamb,https://doi.org/10.1071/an11229,"Whole genome association studies in humans have shown a strong relationship between omega-3 levels in plasma and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) located close to genes whose protein products are involved in the biosynthesis of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids. In sheep and other livestock species, the calpain/calpastatin system is the principal influence on natural variation in meat tenderness between animals. Using targeted next generation sequencing, we sequenced the fatty acid desaturase locus (FADS1/2/3), ELOVL2 and SLC26A10 and the calpain/calpastatin (CAPN1/2/3 and CAST) gene loci of 35 industry sires from the Australian flock. A total of 753 SNP were identified and 182 of these SNP were selected for incorporation onto a research SNP panel that represented the genetic variation across the nine genes. A total of 1252 animals were genotyped from the Australian Sheep CRC Information Nucleus Flock for these SNP and the genomic association was calculated for omega-3 fatty acid content and objective meat tenderness in lamb. Six SNP within CAST and CAPN2 showed association with shear force at Day 5 post-mortem at a significance level of P ≤ 0.01. When these were fitted simultaneously in a mixed-model analysis with fixed effects and covariates, three SNP remained significant. These SNP each had an unfavourable effect on shear force of between 1.1 and 1.8 N, with a combined effect of 4.1 N. The frequency of the favourable alleles in the progeny measured indicates that these SNP hold good potential for improving the management of meat tenderness across Merino, Border Leicester and Terminal sire types. No SNP within the FADS1/2/3, ELOVL2 and SLC26A10 gene regions were associated with lamb muscle omega-3 levels. This indicates that genetic variation in the long-chain omega-3 biosynthesis pathway genes analysed here may not be important for omega-3 content in lamb within the Information Nucleus Flock population."

"Association between Insulin–Like Growth Factor I Polymorphism and Early Growth Traits in Iranian Zandi Sheep, Found Polymerase Chain Reaction Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)",,"Early growth traits in sheep are economically important. Breeding for these traits has been shown to be problematic using quantitative genetic methods, particularly in native sheep herds. Molecular genetics is useful for sheep breeding. The gene for insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is one of the important candidate genes known for ovine early growth traits. The aim of this study was to investigate IGF1 polymorphism in exon 1 and its association with some early growth traits in Iranian Zandi sheep. For this purpose, 120 male and female lambs were selected randomly at up to 5 months old and blood samples were taken individually. Also, phenotypic records were collected from related farms. Genomic DNA was extracted by a salting-out method. A 265 bp region in exon 1 of IGF1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), then genotyped using the restriction endonuclease HaeII. Two alleles, here called A and B, were found. Examination using PopGene32 showed allele frequencies of 0.47 A and 0.53 B. Genotype % frequencies were 28.33 AA, 37.50 AB and 34.17 BB. Chi-squared and G-squared tests showed that the population was not at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P<0.01). An association study in SAS 9.2 found no significant effect of IGF1 genotype on any of these early growth traits: birth weight, average daily gain up to age five months and weight at age five months. However the AA genotype was linked to the highest values of birth weight. IGF1 polymorphism should be investigated as a molecular marker along with other polygene effects for growth traits in native sheep breeding programs."

Sequencing revealed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; g.‐1398G&gt;T) in the 5' upstream region of MYH4. It was significantly associated with the number of type IIa muscle fibers and water‐holding capacity based on filter‐paper fluid uptake. The GG genotype groups had a greater number of type IIa fibers and a larger area composed of type IIa fibers than the other genotype group ( P = 0.004 and P = 0.061, respectively). Expression level of MYH4 gene in the genotype TT or GT was higher than in genotype of GG ( P &lt; 0.0001). The T allele may enhance expression level of MYH4 gene and then the portion of IIb type fiber in the muscle be increased by the T allelle. Therefore, we suggest that the g.‐1398G&gt;T in the 5' upstream region of the porcine MYH4 may be used as a molecular marker for meat quality traits, although its functional effect is not defined yet."
Predation Risk Reverses the Potential Effects of Warming on Plant-Herbivore Interactions by Altering the Relative Strengths of Trait- and Density-Mediated Interactions,https://doi.org/10.1086/692605,"Climate warming will initiate numerous changes in ecological community structure and function, and such high-level impacts derive from temperature-driven changes in individual physiology. Specifically, top-down control of plant biomass is sensitive to rising temperatures, but the direction of change depends on a complex interaction between temperature, predation risk, and predator thermal preference. Here, I developed an individual-based optimal foraging model of three trophic levels (primary producers, herbivores, and predators) to examine how warming affects top-down control of primary producers via both trait- and density-mediated indirect interactions (TMII and DMII). This model also factorially crossed warm- and cold-adapted herbivores and predators to determine how local adaptation modifies the effects of warming on food web interactions. Regardless of predator thermal preference, warming increased herbivore foraging effort and by extension predation rates. As a result, TMII declined in importance at high temperatures regardless of predator thermal adaptation. Finally, predation risk reduced herbivore fitness via both indirect (i.e., reduced herbivore size) and direct (i.e., reduced herbivore survival) pathways. These results suggest that, contrary to previous predictions, warming might stimulate primary productivity by reducing herbivore population sizes, releasing plants from immediate top-down control."
"The effect of competition and horizontal trait inheritance on invasion, fixation and polymorphism",,"Horizontal transfer (HT) of heritable information or `traits' (carried by genetic elements, endosymbionts, or culture) is widespread among living organisms. Yet current ecological and evolutionary theory addressing HT is limited. We present a modeling framework for the dynamics of two populations that compete for resources and exchange horizontally (transfer) an otherwise vertically inherited trait. Competition influences individual demographics, affecting population size, which feeds back on the dynamics of transfer. We capture this feedback with a stochastic individual-based model, from which we derive a deterministic approximation for large populations. The interaction between horizontal transfer and competition makes possible the stable (or bi-stable) polymorphic maintenance of deleterious traits (including costly plasmids). When transfer rates are of a general density-dependent form, transfer stochasticity contributes strongly to population fluctuations. For an initially rare trait, we describe the probabilistic dynamics of invasion and fixation. Acceleration of fixation by HT is faster when competition is weak in the resident population. Thus, HT can have a major impact on the distribution of mutational effects that are fixed, and our model provides a basis for a general theory of the influence of HT on eco-evolutionary dynamics and adaptation."
Autistic traits predict social avoidance and distress: The chain mediating role of perceived stress and interpersonal alienation,https://doi.org/10.1111/sjop.12946,"Social avoidance and distress are the primary aspects of social anxiety. Nonautistic people with high levels of autistic traits are more likely to exhibit social avoidance and distress. However, research has yet to reveal how autistic traits induce social avoidance and distress. To fill this gap, the present study recruited 708 participants to complete the 25‐item Autism Spectrum Quotient, Social Avoidance and Distress Scale, Chinese Perceived Stress Scale, and Interpersonal Alienation Subscale. The results indicated that autistic traits significantly predicted social avoidance and distress in nonautistic people. In addition, autistic traits induced social avoidance and distress through perceived stress and interpersonal alienation, respectively. Importantly, perceived stress and interpersonal alienation (including the subdimensions of interpersonal alienation: sense of loneliness, sense of social isolation, and alienation between family members) partially mediated the relationships between autistic traits and social avoidance and distress. Overall, autistic traits predict social avoidance and distress via perceived stress and interpersonal alienation. This finding extends the hypothetical model of clinical anxiety in autism spectrum disorders. Furthermore, reducing perceived stress and interpersonal alienation in nonautistic people with high levels of autistic traits may be a valid intervention method to prevent and eliminate their social avoidance and distress."
Voles mediate functional trait diversity along a resource gradient,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13686,"Abstract Disentangling the effect of multiple ecological processes on plant trait composition is complicated by the fact that both top‐down and bottom‐up processes may affect similar traits. We examined the interacting role of resource variation and vole herbivory on functional trait patterns in an annual California grassland. We manipulated vole herbivory via exclosures at eight grassland sites along a steep resource gradient and measured plant composition and functional traits over 3 years. Plants with resource acquisitive functional traits were favoured at sites with increasing resources. Vole herbivory influenced community‐weighted mean (CWM) leaf nitrogen (N) and seed mass, suggesting these traits may mediate plant susceptibility to vole herbivory. After 3 years, CWM leaf N increased in the absence of the voles, as did CWM seed mass, although this increase in CWM seed mass only occurred at higher resource sites. Vole exclusion at high‐resources sites also increased the functional diversity of leaf N and seed mass by the end of the experiment. Overall, environmental filtering primarily structured the dominant plant trait strategies, but vole herbivory also influenced the functional diversity of traits that influence herbivore susceptibility, particularly at resource‐rich sites. Thus, habitat filtering and herbivory can operate on different dimensions of plant functional composition to influence the species and functional composition of communities.

The role of leaf traits and bird-mediated insect predation on patterns of herbivory in a semiarid environment in central Mexico,https://doi.org/10.17129/botsci.812,"Background. In arid environments plants face aridity and herbivory, therefore it has been proposed that both are convergent selective forces. However the drivers of insect herbivory in these ecosystems remain poorly understood. Question. Does insect herbivory vary in two plant associations subject to different levels of aridity? To what extent differences in herbivory are determined either by foliar traits, or predation by birds? Study species. Citharexylum tetramerum, Viguiera pinnatilobata, and Solanum tridynamum. Study site. We compared two-plant associations: the mezquital with a closed canopy and wettest conditions and the tetechera a dry place with an open canopy at the Zapotitlán Valley, México. Methods. We evaluated leaf traits (N, C, water content, leaf strength and trichomes), herbivore insects abundance and the effects on herbivory when some predators are excluded. Results. Herbivory was higher in the drier site (tetechera) than in the more humid one (mezquital) in one year but not in the second one. In both plant associations herbivory increased when predators of herbivores were excluded. Plants in mezquital had more water and nitrogen content than plants in tetechera. The later had higher carbon concentration and carbon:nitrogen ratio, leaf strength and density of trichomes. Abundance of herbivore insects and insect predation were higher in the most arid site. Conclusions. Our results show that insect herbivory increases in the most arid site and that predation by birds plays a role as a driver of herbivory, while resistance to aridity seems to be the main driver of leaf structural characteristics."

Identification of ovalbumin phenotypes of the Asian indigenous chicken populations using polymerase chain reaction‐restriction fragment length polymorphism,https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1344-3941.2003.00126.x,"ABSTRACT Three electrophoretic variations (AA, BB and AB) of ovalbumin controlled by codominant alleles Ov A and Ov B have been observed in various chicken populations. We compared nucleotide sequences of the open reading frame between two alleles of ovalbumin gene. The difference between the two alleles was found as a non‐synonymous substitution of asparagine to aspartic acid as a result of AAT to GAT point mutation at position 8032–8034 in exon 8. We developed polymerase chain reaction‐restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR‐RFLP) protocol in combination with Mbo I restriction endnuclease mapping for the detection of this substitution. By the PCR‐RFLP the allelic frequency of the Ov B was estimated to be within the range of 0.000–0.150 in 11 Asian indigenous chicken populations and 0.000 in four improved breeds used in the present study. Gene frequency, estimated by PCR‐RFLP in the present study, paralleled that obtained by protein polymorphisms of egg white. Thus, this study provides, for the first time, information of the occurrence of ovalbumin allele Ov A and Ov B in Asian indigenous chicken populations."
Unravelling host-mediated effects on hemiparasitic Mexican mistletoe<i>Psittacanthus calyculatus</i>(DC.) G. Don traits linked to mutualisms with pollinators and seed dispersers,https://doi.org/10.1093/jpe/rty008,"While the influence of mistletoe–host interactions on each other's evolution is well-recognized, the role of interactions between mistletoes and its mutualistic pollinators and seed dispersers mediated by host species is relatively unexplored. Here, we examine the effects of host species (Mexican hawthorn Crataegus mexicana DC, black cherry Prunus serotina Ehrh., leather-leaf Mexican oak Quercus crassipes Bonpl.) on flower morphology, nectar production, pollinator visitation rate and female reproductive fitness in hemiparasitic Mexican mistletoe Psittacanthus calyculatus (DC.) G. Don (Loranthaceae) populations at three different locations. We first measured the lengths of corolla, style, stamen, exerted stamen and anther, the length and width of the ovary and nectar availability for mistletoe flowers in natural populations. Then, we evaluated flower visitation and measured (length and width) and weighed the fruits and its seeds of mistletoes growing on each of the three host species. Finally, we evaluated the effects of host species, location and flower traits on fruit or seed size variation (both as proxies of reproductive fitness). We found mistletoes growing on natural hosts P. serotina and Q. crassipes produced larger flowers, fruits and seeds than mistletoes on cultivated C. mexicana. However, these differences varied across space. The amount of available nectar and hummingbird visitation rates in flowers of mistletoes on C. mexicana was higher at the three sites than in flowers of mistletoes on P. serotina or Q. crassipes. The effects of host species, study site and floral trait covariates affected significantly all fitness measures, indicating that mistletoes' reproductive fitness is affected differently depending on the host species and their site of occurrence. These host-associated differences in reproduction might have implications for interactions with mutualistic vectors."
Relationships between the polymorphism of myosin heavy chains and selected meat quality traits of pigs with different susceptibility to stress,https://doi.org/10.5194/aab-53-65-2010,"Abstract. The aim of the investigations was to analyse the share of myosin heavy chains (MHC) isoforms (type I, IIa, IIb, and IIx) in the longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle derived from pigs of different RYR1 genotypes (TT – homozygous negative, CT – heterozygous, CC – homozygous positive). The composition of the MHC isoforms in the muscle tissue of the examined animals was referred to selected meat quality traits. It was revealed that the animals with the CT and TT genotypes were characterized by a significantly (P≤0.05) lower share of the type I and higher share of the type IIb MHC isoform in comparison to homozygotes CC. Inferior tenderness and water holding capacity of meat obtained from pigs susceptible to stress (TT) at 144 h after slaughter could have been associated, among others things, with the increased share of MHC isoform type IIb. The composition of MHC isoforms might be a useful indicator in breeding work in the selection of animals carrying the gene of susceptibility to stress."

Joint effects of female preference intensity and frequency‐dependent predation on the polymorphism maintenance in aposematic sexual traits,https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9356,"Abstract Maintenance of variation in aposematic traits within and among populations is paradoxical because aposematic species are normally under positive frequency‐dependent predation (PFD), which is expected to erode variation. Aposematic traits can evolve in an ecological context where aposematic traits are simultaneously under mate choice. Here, we examine how the mate preference intensity affects the permissiveness of polymorphism in sexually selected aposematic traits under different PFD regimes. We use the haploid version of the classical sexual selection model and show that strong mate preferences can substantially increase the permissiveness of polymorphism in aposematic traits under different PFD regimes. The Fisher process can interact with PFD, and their interaction can promote the maintenance of polymorphism within populations when mate preferences are strong. We show that the same selective conditions that promote the maintenance of polymorphism within populations reduce the likelihood of divergence in aposematic traits among populations."
Polymerase chain reaction multiplexing of microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphism markers for quantitative trait loci mapping of wild house mice,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1755-0998.2008.02385.x,"Abstract We tested 96 microsatellites and 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms for their allelic distribution in two subspecies of the house mouse, Mus musculus musculus and M. m. domesticus. Sixty‐two microsatellites discriminated strain‐specific differences among nine wild‐derived ‘ musculus’ and ‘ domesticus’ and three ‘classical’ laboratory strains. For efficient genotyping, we optimized multiplex conditions using five microsatellites per polymerase chain reaction. All 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms were also optimized for simultaneous analysis in one reaction using SNaPshot multiplex. The uniform distribution of markers on autosomes and on the X chromosome makes these panels potentially useful tools for quantitative trait loci mapping of wild house mice."
Functional traits mediate the effect of land use on drivers of community stability within and across trophic levels,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adp6445,"Understanding how land use affects temporal stability is crucial to preserve biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Yet, the mechanistic links between land-use intensity and stability-driving mechanisms remain unclear, with functional traits likely playing a key role. Using 13 years of data from 300 sites in Germany, we tested whether and how trait-based community features mediate the effect of land-use intensity on acknowledged stability drivers (compensatory dynamics, portfolio effect, and dominant species variability), within and across plant and arthropod communities. Trait-based plant features, especially the prevalence of acquisitive strategies along the leaf-economics spectrum, were the main land-use intensity mediators within and across taxonomic and trophic levels, consistently influencing dominant species variability. Functional diversity also mediated land-use intensity effects but played a lesser role. Our analysis discloses trait-based community features as key mediators of land-use effects on stability drivers, emphasizing the need to consider multi-trophic functional interactions to better understand complex ecosystem dynamics."
The effect of autistic traits on prosocial behavior: The chain mediating role of received social support and perceived social support,https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613231177776,"There is growing evidence that the defining characteristics of autism spectrum disorder are distributed across the general population; therefore, understanding the correlates of prosocial behavior in individuals with high levels of autistic traits could shed light on autism spectrum disorder and prosocial behavior. In this study, the mechanism underlying the influence of individuals’ autistic traits on their prosocial behavior was explored by conducting a questionnaire survey of 414 Chinese college students. The results showed that autistic traits can influence individuals’ prosocial behavior not only through the separate effects of received social support and perceived social support but also through the chain mediating effects of received social support and perceived social support; however, the direct effect of autistic traits on individuals’ prosocial behavior is not significant. This study is conducive to understanding the internal mechanism underlying the relationship between autistic traits and prosocial behavior. Future work is required to further investigate the clinical autism spectrum disorder samples and cross-cultural applicability of the model found in this study. Lay abstract Autistic traits are known to be associated with a set of core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. The impact of autistic traits on prosocial behavior, including a consideration of the role of social support, has never been explored. We investigated whether and how social support mediates the autistic trait–prosocial behavior relationship. We found that autistic traits can influence prosocial behavior not only through received social support and perceived social support but also indirectly through the chain mediating effects of received social support and perceived social support. This study contributes to the understanding of how and to what extent prosocial behavior is influenced by autistic traits.

Trait Depression and Subjective Well-Being: The Chain Mediating Role of Community Feeling and Self-Compassion,https://doi.org/10.3390/bs13060448,"Although subjective well-being has been widely discussed as being one of the important indicators of clinical depression, few studies have explored how it relates to trait depression. In particular, increasing the number of positive experiences has long been a potential goal for depression-related clinical interventions, but the mechanisms by which such interventions work in countering depression have been poorly studied. Grounded in the cognitive theory of depression, the current study aimed to address this specific gap by testing the mediating effects of community feeling and self-compassion between trait depression and subjective well-being. A survey of 783 college students found that trait depression was not only able to directly and negatively predict individual subjective well-being but also indirectly predict individual subjective well-being through the mediating role of community feeling and self-compassion alone and through the chain mediating role of self-compassion from community feeling. These findings reveal the internal mechanisms of trait depression that, to some extent, impede subjective well-being and offer certain guiding significance for the self-regulation of interventions for clinical and non-clinical individuals with trait depression."

"A fish-mediated trophic cascade on freshwater calanoid copepod abundance is concealed by food web fatty acid availability, functional traits and population sex ratio",https://doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fby002,"We applied essential fatty acids as a biomarker to experimentally test the effects of a fish-mediated trophic cascade on calanoid copepod nutritional state and functional traits in north-temperate freshwater ponds. A whole-pond experiment was conducted where young-of-the-year brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) were introduced into three natural, fishless ponds with no previous history of fish introduction, and compared with four similar naturally fishless ponds. We unexpectedly found no effect of the fish-mediated trophic cascade on copepod population nutritional state and abundance, despite enhanced phytoplankton resources in fish-stocked ponds. While salmonids increased individual female copepod fecundity, the fish also reduced gravid copepod female abundance and altered copepod population sex ratios in favour of males. Fish predation likely influenced the overall nutritional state of calanoid copepod populations by expenditure of key lipids in male copepods through increased activity linked to female mate limitation, and selective predation on gravid female copepods. Therefore, the positive effects of the fish in enhancing the essential fatty acid content of phytoplankton communities via nutrient additions were not sufficient to over-ride the negative effects of fish predation on copepod population nutritional state and abundance."

Moreover, we aim to evaluate the potential mediating roles played by both distress disclosure and perceived social support in this dynamic relationship. Method All participants completed assessments using the Adolescent Self-Rating Life Events Checklist, Rumination Response Scale, Post-Stress Growth Inventory, Distress Disclosure Index, and Perceived Social Support Scale. Correlation and mediation analyses were conducted using SPSS PROCESS 4 MACRO. Results All students reported experiencing mild psychological impacts as a result of negative life events in the past year and displayed moderate levels of PSG. There was no significant correlation observed between the effects of negative life events and PSG. Significant negative correlations were found between trait rumination and distress disclosure, perceived social support, and PSG. Distress disclosure and perceived social support jointly operated as sequential mediators in the relationship between trait rumination and PSG among all the participants. Qualitative analyses revealed different correlation patterns of high- versus low-ruminator. Conclusion Trait rumination affects PSG both directly and indirectly, through its influence on distress disclosure and perceived social support.

Ecological Traits and Intraguild Competition Mediate Spatial and Temporal Overlaps Among Sympatric Mesocarnivores,https://doi.org/10.3390/d17020108,"In terrestrial mammalian carnivore guilds, interspecific competitions (interferences and resource competitions) among sympatric species induce their ecological and behavioral patterns and population dynamics, thereby shaping community structures. Competitive species must partition their ecological niches for sympatry, while the extent of niche overlaps is mediated by either the ecological traits (e.g., body size differences) or environmental features. We aimed to elucidate the patterns of spatial and temporal niche overlaps in mesocarnivore guilds, which are mediated by their ecological traits, regional environments, and anthropogenic disturbances. We investigated the spatial occurrence and diel activities of six mesocarnivore species and estimated their spatial and temporal overlap indices in various landscapes with different anthropogenic disturbances in central Bulgaria. Statistical modeling demonstrated that spatial overlap among mesocarnivores declined when mesocarnivore pairs were within the same family and when large carnivores (particularly wolves, Canis lupus) were present. Furthermore, we found that the extent of their temporal overlaps was associated with taxonomic and body size differences in mesocarnivore pairs as well as their trophic competitions. Our findings indicated that the intensity of interferences among mesocarnivore species was key for the decline of spatial or temporal niche overlap to relax antagonistic interactions."

Trait-mediated effects of predation risk: How does it influence forest bird-habitat relationships?,,"Understanding animal-habitat relationships remains one of the key inquiries of ecology. In studying animal-habitat relationships, the traditional approach has adopted a resource-centered view, relying heavily on directly measuring attributes of a habitat itself. However, ecological constraints that may influence access to and limit the use of resources are equally important, but have received much less attention. In my dissertation, I attempted to test the role of predation risk, specifically the non-lethal form of predation risk acting via trait-mediated effects mechanisms, in influencing forest bird-habitat relationships as an ecological constraint, from three different angles. These angles pertained to: (1) the relevance of trait-mediated predation risk (TMPR) in birds’ response to habitat degradation; (2) the role of TMPR, particularly different types of TMPR (e.g., risk for adults versus for offspring), in influencing forest birds’
habitat selection, community assembly, and reproduction. I first assessed whether and to what extent habitat degradation alters the perception of predation risk (and hence TMPR) in understory forest birds in the tropical lowland rainforest of Sumatra, Indonesia (Chapter 2). In four forest locations that differed in the degree of habitat degradedness, I used playback techniques to induce the mobbing / inspection behavior of small-bodied understory forest birds, and quantified their behavioral intensity as a measure of their risk perception. I found that understory gleaning species had significantly increased perception of predation risk in degraded forest habitats, and such increase was at least partially attributable to forest vegetation changes. I then experimentally tested whether and to what extent TMPR altered (1) the habitat settlement decisions of forest breeding birds and in turn shaped the structure of the breeding bird community (Chapter 3), and (2) the reproductive output
and strategy of a focal forest bird species the Eastern bluebird Sialia sialis, and how such effects differed between risks to the adults versus to offspring (Chapter 4). I experimentally increased the level of perceived adult, offspring, or both adult and offspring predation risk for sandhill forest birds with playbacks of predator vocalizations, and studied birds’ responses from the perspectives of avian community structure and reproduction. I found that increased perception of predation risk tended to negatively affect the abundance, occurrence and / or detection probability of most prey forest birds in ways generally explainable by body size, and largely reduced community species richness and shifted community composition. I also found that increased perception of predation risk strongly influenced the reproduction of the focal species Eastern bluebird Sialia sialis, by impairing nesting performance and reducing reproductive output. Taken together, my findings demonstrated that:
(1) TMPR was likely involved in understory forest birds’ response to habitat degradation; (2) TMPR could strongly alter…"

Yet current ecological and evolutionary theory addressing HT is limited. We present a modeling framework for the dynamics of two populations that compete for resources and exchange horizontally (transfer) an otherwise vertically inherited trait. Competition influences individual demographics, affecting population size, which feeds back on the dynamics of transfer. We capture this feedback with a stochastic individual-based model, from which we derive a deterministic approximation for large populations. The interaction between horizontal transfer and competition makes possible the stable (or bi-stable) polymorphic maintenance of deleterious traits (including costly plasmids). When transfer rates are of a general density-dependent form, transfer stochasticity contributes strongly to population fluctuations. For an initially rare trait, we describe the probabilistic dynamics of invasion and fixation. Acceleration of fixation by HT is faster when competition is weak in the resident population. Thus, HT can have a major impact on the distribution of mutational effects that are fixed, and our model provides a basis for a general theory of the influence of HT on eco-evolutionary dynamics and adaptation."

From Drosophila to Humans: MYC-Mediated Clone Competition as an Evolutionary Trait of Tumor Progression,https://doi.org/10.6092/unibo/amsdottorato/7598,"Cell competition describes the result of a mechanism of fitness comparison undertaken by cells inhabiting the same tissue, that leads to the elimination of the weakest cells and, in the physiology, to the formation of a homogeneous organ. Over the years, many molecules have been identified that are involved in cell competition and among them MYC oncoprotein: from Drosophila to mammals, cell populations characterised by higher expression of MYC induce apoptotic death of the neighbours, allowing the fittest to acquire an advantage in space occupancy. 
My work defined the presence of markers of MYC-mediated cell competition in primary and secondary human carcinomas and demonstrated through experiments in human cancer cell lines that MYC modulation is per se sufficient to induce competitive behaviours in both genetically distant and identical cells. Noteworthy, MYC under-regulation in the fittest cell line is sufficient to undermine its competitive status, suggesting a role for MYC-mediated cell competition in the selective growth of tumour clones and, as a consequence, in cancer evolution. In addition, I was able to demonstrate a functional cooperation between MYC and p53 in this phenomenon.
The data obtained in the Drosophila model, where MYC over-expressing and MYC knock-down clones have been induced within a growing tumour, suggest that MYC-mediated cell competition is normally at work in these malignant cells, and it shapes cancer evolution through the elimination of the less fit cells (with lower levels of MYC) and the expansion of the most performant ones (with higher levels of MYC), demonstrating an evolutionary role played in defining the composition and the size of the final mass."
"Where Two Are Fighting, the Third Wins: Stronger Selection Facilitates Greater Polymorphism in Traits Conferring Competition-Dispersal Tradeoffs",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0147970,"A major conundrum in evolution is that, despite natural selection, polymorphism is still omnipresent in nature: Numerous species exhibit multiple morphs, namely several abundant values of an important trait. Polymorphism is particularly prevalent in asymmetric traits, which are beneficial to their carrier in disruptive competitive interference but at the same time bear disadvantages in other aspects, such as greater mortality or lower fecundity. Here we focus on asymmetric traits in which a better competitor disperses fewer offspring in the absence of competition. We report a general pattern in which polymorphic populations emerge when disruptive selection increases: The stronger the selection, the greater the number of morphs that evolve. This pattern is general and is insensitive to the form of the fitness function. The pattern is somewhat counterintuitive since directional selection is excepted to sharpen the trait distribution and thereby reduce its diversity (but note that similar patterns were suggested in studies that demonstrated increased biodiversity as local selection increases in ecological communities). We explain the underlying mechanism in which stronger selection drives the population towards more competitive values of the trait, which in turn reduces the population density, thereby enabling lesser competitors to stably persist with reduced need to directly compete. Thus, we believe that the pattern is more general and may apply to asymmetric traits more broadly. This robust pattern suggests a comparative, unified explanation to a variety of polymorphic traits in nature."

Polymorphism of interleukin 10 receptor alpha chain(IL-10RA) gene and its relationship with phenotypes in SLE mice,,"Objective:To determine the relationship between IL-10RA gene polymorphism and disease phenotypes in lupus-prone NZB×NZW(B/W)F1 mice.Methods:The susceptibility loci of systemic lupus erythematosus(SLE) were determined by genome-wide quantitative trait locus(QTL) analysis using microsatellite markers.Candidate genes were selected and sequenced.Genotyping of the candidate gene which was polymorphic between NZB and NZW strains was done by PCR-single sequence conformation polymorphism(SSCP) analysis and associations between the genotypes and the SLE phenotypes,such as anti-chromatin antibodies,anti-DNA antibodies,anti-histone antibodies and protrinuria,were investigated using B/W F1×NZB backcross mice.Results:The susceptibility loci for high serum level of IgG anti-chromatin antibodies in B/W F1×NZB backcross mice was tightly linked to IL-10RA gene and derived from NZW strain.Sequence analysis of the IL-10RA coding region showed polymorphism between NZB and NZW mice and the polymorphism included 18 nucleotide transitions in the coding region,7 of which would lead to substitutions of amino acid in the resulting IL-10RA protein.The NZW IL-10RA allele was significantly associated with high serum level of IgG anti-chromatin antibodies,anti-DNA antibodies,anti-histone antibodies and protrinuria in B/W F1×NZB backcross mice.Another lupus-prone mice,MRL,shared the same IL-10RA polymorphism with NZW mice.Conclusion:Our data suggest that the polymorphic NZW IL-10RA allele on chromosome 9 is related to SLE phenotypes in B/W F1×NZB backcross mice,which may contribute to the development of SLE by serving as a susceptibility gene in murine lupus."
Trait- and density-mediated effects of predation on fecundity and fertility of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes,https://doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjad146,"Abstract Prey populations that encounter predators experience density-mediated effects through lethality and associated numerical changes in the population. Prey also exhibit trait-mediated effects through nonlethal alterations in phenotypic traits associated with exposure to predators. Immature stages of mosquitoes commonly co-occur in habitats along with predators, a natural source of mortality and potential biocontrol agent. Toxorhynchites rutilus Coquillett 1896 is a natural source of mortality with potential as a biological control agent. Previous studies have shown that predation and the mere presence of Tx. rutilus (predator cues) can alter the life-history traits of Aedes aegypti (L. 1762). In addition to observed reductions in recruitment of adults (lethality), exposure to Tx. rutilus without consumption resulted in adult Ae. aegypti females with altered growth and reduced lifespan. To determine the influence of predation on the reproductive biology of Ae. aegypti, we tested the hypothesis that predation, or exposure to predator cues, will compromise the reproduction of adult survivors through reductions in fecundity (egg batch size) and fertility (hatch rate). We observed that for both female and male Ae. aegypti, survival to adulthood was the lowest and development time the shortest in treatments containing prey removal effects, attributable to predation and treatment manipulations of density reduction. There were effects of Ae. aegypti weight, but not predation treatments, on fecundity and fertility. Results suggest that predator-mediated effects on Ae. aegypti derive from lethal effects due to consumption and alterations in other phenotypic traits of survivors, including development, weight, lifespan of adults, and population growth, but not reproductive parameters measured here."
Mesocosm evidence for sandprawn-mediated shifts in pelagic resource ratios and phytoplankton traits,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2024.108874,"Bentho-pelagic coupling is a key determinant of multifunctionality in marine ecosystems, influencing critical processes such as production and trophic dynamics. However, knowledge gaps regarding biotically mediated bentho-pelagic coupling limit our understanding of ecosystem responses to global change, and the functional significance of biota nested therein. This is especially relevant for endobenthic ecosystem engineers, which rank amongst the most dynamic of sediment and porewater manipulators in marine systems. Based on this rationale, we tested the consequences of ecosystem engineering by South African endobenthic deposit-feeding crustaceans (sandprawns) for pelagic microbial assemblages, to make inferences about bentho-pelagic coupling. Findings from a factorial 18-day mesocosm experiment indicated a density-dependent, sandprawn-induced decline in phytoplankton relative abundance, but negligible effects on bacterial groups. Picophytoplankton appeared more susceptible than nanophytoplankton to sandprawn density, since relative abundance of the former group declined more in the presence of sandprawns than the latter. By the end of the experiment, there was evidence of a trait shift in phytoplankton assemblages in response to sandprawn presence, with nanophytoplankton being more dominant in the presence of sandprawns. Our findings suggest that pelagic microbes may have differential susceptibilities to endobenthic deposit-feeders and provide useful information on pathways by which these engineers influence bentho-pelagic coupling. These pathways need further evaluation to better understand secondary food-web ramifications and ecosystem responses to global change."

Savanna ecosystem structure and productivity along a rainfall gradient: the role of competition and stress tolerance mediated by plant functional traits,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-3977,"Abstract. Environmental gradients affect vegetation structure and ecosystem productivity. Along the northern Australia tropical transect (NATT), which transitions from tropical moist conditions in the north to arid conditions in the south, vegetation composition and structure are closely tied to rainfall patterns. We hypothesise that biotic competition and abiotic stress exhibit opposing patterns along the NATT rainfall gradient and aim to disentangle these effects on vegetation structure and productivity. Using a trait-based dynamic vegetation model, we simulated vegetation responses to varying competition and stress along the NATT. The model successfully simulated spatial variations and temporal patterns in carbon and water fluxes, where evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity decrease with rainfall along the gradient. Simulation results showed that taller and medium-sized Eucalyptus had higher carbon mass, leaf area index, and foliar projective cover at the wet end of the gradient. In contrast, Acacia and grasses were dominant at the dry end. Crown coverage shows spatial and temporal variability with rainfall, with higher variability in tree plant functional types (PFTs) crown cover in the north and more uniform in the south, while grasses have maximum coverage during the wet season in the dry end of the gradient. These patterns suggest a shift in the importance of biotic versus abiotic factors, with competition playing a more significant role in the wet region and stress becoming more influential as aridity increases in the south. Overall, our study underscores water availability as a primary driver of vegetation structure and highlights the role of competition and stress in modulating ecosystem structure, composition and productivity along the rainfall gradient."

Personality Traits and Quality of Life Among Older Adults: The Chain Mediating Effects of Perceived Social Support and Positive Coping Styles,https://doi.org/10.1080/00221325.2024.2413491,"The pathways between personality traits and older adults' quality of life (QOL) have been well studied. However, perceived social support and positive coping styles should not be ignored by older adults' QOL. Hence, this study examines the chain mediating role of perceived social support and positive coping styles between personality traits and older adults' QOL. In total, 230 older individuals (Meanage = 69.43, SDage = 7.23, age range from 60 to 93) participated in this study. All older people provided a rating of QOL and perceived social support, the Chinese Big Five personality, and positive coping styles. (1a) the five personality traits of older adults were significantly associated with QOL; (2b) perceived social support mediated the relationship between three personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, and agreeableness) and QOL; (3c) positive coping styles played a mediator role in the personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, and agreeableness) and QOL; (4d) perceived social support and positive coping styles had a significant chain mediating effect on the three dimensions of personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, and agreeableness) and QOL. As mediating influences, social support and positive coping styles can be applied to efforts to promote QOL for older adults who share the personality traits of neuroticism, extraversion, and agreeableness."

Association between autistic traits and sleep quality among Chinese junior high school students: The chain mediating roles of self‐control and mindfulness,https://doi.org/10.1002/pits.23311,"Abstract To explore the relationships between autistic traits, self‐control, mindfulness, and sleep quality, and the mechanism underlying these relationships, we recruited a sample of 972 junior high school students who completed a survey consisting of the Chinese version of the Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory‐short form, Self‐Control Scale, Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure, and Sleep Condition Indicator. The correlation analyses revealed that autistic traits were significantly negatively correlated with self‐control, mindfulness, and sleep quality. Conversely, self‐control was significantly positively correlated with mindfulness and sleep quality in junior high school students. Mediation analyses indicated that self‐control and mindfulness play a chain‐mediating role in the association between autistic traits and sleep quality among junior high school students. In conclusion, enhancing levels of self‐control and mindfulness is essential for improving sleep quality among junior high school students with high levels of autistic traits."

Effects of Personality Traits on Turnover Intention of Star-rated Hotel and Hostel Employees -Mediating Effect of Work Values and Moderating Effect of Human Resource Management Practices,https://doi.org/10.47260/amae/1527,"Abstract This study selected employees of hotels or hostels registered as members of hotel associations in Taiwan’s six special municipalities as the study subjects through purposive sampling. An online questionnaire was distributed to the waiters, captains, supervisors, assistant managers, and part-timers, and 201 valid questionnaires were returned. Regression analysis revealed that work values (affective values) mediated the relationship between personality traits (agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience) and turnover intention (dependent variable). Human resource management practices (decision-making and feedback) moderated the relationship between work values (instrumental and cognitive values) and turnover intention. Hence, business organizations must consider their philosophy, goals, market positioning, and available resources. If resources are limited, they should first focus on enhancing employees’ psychological wellbeing by increasing the additional values associated with the jobs, improving the working environment, creating a friendly workplace, and improving supervisors’ leadership styles and then increase salary and benefits, which have instrumental values. Keywords: Personality trait, Work value, Turnover intention, Human resource management practice."
