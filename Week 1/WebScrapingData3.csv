The contribution of trait-mediated indirect effects to the net effects of a predator,"Many prey modify traits in response to predation risk and this modification of traits can influence the prey's resource acquisition rate. A predator thus can have a “nonlethal” impact on prey that can lead to indirect effects on other community members. Such indirect interactions are termed trait-mediated indirect interactions because they arise from a predator's influence on prey traits, rather than prey density. Because such nonlethal predator effects are immediate, can influence the entire prey population, and can occur over the entire prey lifetime, we argue that nonlethal predator effects are likely to contribute strongly to the net indirect effects of predators (i.e., nonlethal effects may be comparable in magnitude to those resulting from killing prey). This prediction was supported by an experiment in which the indirect effects of a larval dragonfly (Anax sp.) predator on large bullfrog tadpoles (Rana catesbeiana), through nonlethal effects on competing small bullfrog tadpoles, were large relative to indirect effects caused by density reduction of the small tadpoles (the lethal effect). Treatments in which lethal and nonlethal effects of Anax were manipulated independently indicated that this result was robust for a large range of different combinations of lethal and nonlethal effects. Because many, if not most, prey modify traits in response to predators, our results suggest that the magnitude of interaction coefficients between two species may often be dynamically related to changes in other community members, and that many indirect effects previously attributed to the lethal effects of predators may instead be due to shifts in traits of surviving prey.","[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.071061998"", ""https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc31151?pdf=render"", ""https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/449ff563c53abf3bfc9da2eacc41ad15f277536e?utm_source=consensus""]","[""The primacy of density\u2010mediated indirect effects in a community of wolves, elk, and aspen"", ""Size\u2010specific reduction in kelp consumption by New Zealand urchins exposed to chemical cues from the red rock lobster"", ""Chimeric states induced by higher-order interactions in coupled prey-predator systems."", ""Fish microbiota repel ovipositing mosquitoes."", ""Housework or vigilance?

Susceptibility to Predation Affects Trait-Mediated Indirect Interactions by Reversing Interspecific Competition,"Numerous studies indicate that the behavioral responses of prey to the presence of predators can have an important role in structuring assemblages through trait-mediated indirect interactions. Few studies, however, have addressed how relative susceptibility to predation influences such interactions. Here we examine the effect of chemical cues from the common shore crab Carcinus maenas on the foraging behavior of two common intertidal gastropod molluscs. Of the two model consumers studied, Littorina littorea is morphologically more vulnerable to crab predation than Gibbula umbilicalis, and it exhibited greater competitive ability in the absence of predation threat. However, Littorina demonstrated a greater anti-predator response when experimentally exposed to predation cues, resulting in a lower level of foraging. This reversed the competitive interaction, allowing Gibbula substantially increased access to shared resources. Our results demonstrate that the susceptibility of consumers to predation can influence species interactions, and suggest that inter-specific differences in trait-mediated indirect interactions are another mechanism through which non-consumptive predator effects may influence trophic interactions.","[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0023068"", ""https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0023068&type=printable"", ""https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0495fd8729d0e138036bb6fdbf237592d014fcb7?utm_source=consensus""]","[""Effects of local anthropogenic stressors on a habitat cascade in an estuarine seagrass system"", ""Effects of Predator Avoidance Behavior on the Coexistence of Competing Prey"", ""Olfactory navigation in aquatic gastropods"", ""Intermediate predator na\u00efvet\u00e9 and sex-skewed vulnerability predict the impact of an invasive higher predator"", ""The Braveheart amphipod: a review of responses of invasive Dikerogammarus villosus to predation signals"", ""Predation and Competition Differentially Affect the Interactions and Trophic Niches of a Neotropical Amphibian Guild"", ""Combined effects of predation risk and food quality on freshwater detritivore insects"", ""Differential Responses of Two Ecologically Similar Case-Bearing Caddisfly Species to a Fish Chemical Cue: Implications for a Coexistence Mechanism"", ""Effects of predation risk and temperature on foraging behaviour of Littorina littorea"", ""Fiddler crab spatial distributions are influenced by physiological stressors independent of sympatric interactions""]","[""Effects of local anthropogenic stressors on a habitat cascade in an estuarine seagrass system"", ""Effects of Predator Avoidance Behavior on the Coexistence of Competing Prey"", ""Olfactory navigation in aquatic gastropods"", ""Intermediate predator na\u00efvet\u00e9 and sex-skewed vulnerability predict the impact of an invasive higher predator"", ""The Braveheart amphipod: a review of responses of invasive Dikerogammarus villosus to predation signals"", ""Predation and Competition Differentially Affect the Interactions and Trophic Niches of a Neotropical Amphibian Guild"", ""Combined effects of predation risk and food quality on freshwater detritivore insects"", ""Differential Responses of Two Ecologically Similar Case-Bearing Caddisfly Species to a Fish Chemical Cue: Implications for a Coexistence Mechanism"", ""Effects of predation risk and temperature on foraging behaviour of Littorina littorea"", ""Fiddler crab spatial distributions are influenced by physiological stressors independent of sympatric interactions""]"
Predator and prey functional traits: understanding the adaptive machinery driving predator–prey interactions,"Predator–prey relationships are a central component of community dynamics. Classic approaches have tried to understand and predict these relationships in terms of consumptive interactions between predator and prey species, but characterizing the interaction this way is insufficient to predict the complexity and context dependency inherent in predator–prey relationships. Recent approaches have begun to explore predator–prey relationships in terms of an evolutionary-ecological game in which predator and prey adapt to each other through reciprocal interactions involving context-dependent expression of functional traits that influence their biomechanics. Functional traits are defined as any morphological, behavioral, or physiological trait of an organism associated with a biotic interaction. Such traits include predator and prey body size, predator and prey personality, predator hunting mode, prey mobility, prey anti-predator behavior, and prey physiological stress. Here, I discuss recent advances in this functional trait approach. Evidence shows that the nature and strength of many interactions are dependent upon the relative magnitude of predator and prey functional traits. Moreover, trait responses can be triggered by non-consumptive predator–prey interactions elicited by responses of prey to risk of predation. These interactions in turn can have dynamic feedbacks that can change the context of the predator–prey interaction, causing predator and prey to adapt their traits—through phenotypically plastic or rapid evolutionary responses—and the nature of their interaction. Research shows that examining predator–prey interactions through the lens of an adaptive evolutionary-ecological game offers a foundation to explain variety in the nature and strength of predator–prey interactions observed in different ecological contexts.","[""http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.11813.1"", ""https://f1000research.com/articles/6-1767/v1/pdf"", ""https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a979718758f6c877a5401c2689edc072b13591f7?utm_source=consensus""]","[""An empirical predator\u2012prey model: Examining the interaction of Florida panthers, white\u2010tailed deer, and cattle in Florida"", ""Dietary habits of fishing cats in a human-dominated wetland in Coastal Thailand"", ""Does size matter?
