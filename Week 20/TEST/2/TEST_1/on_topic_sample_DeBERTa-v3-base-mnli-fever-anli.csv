https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.17037,Competition‐induced transgenerational plasticity influences competitive interactions and leaf decomposition of offspring,"Summary Phenotypic plasticity, within and across generations (transgenerational plasticity), allows organisms and their progeny to adapt to the environment without modification of the underlying DNA. Recent findings suggest that epigenetic modifications are important mediators of such plasticity. However, empirical studies have, so far, mainly focused on plasticity in response to abiotic factors, overlooking the response to competition. We tested for within‐generation and transgenerational phenotypic plasticity triggered by plant–plant competition intensity, and we tested whether it was mediated via DNA methylation, using the perennial, apomictic herb Taraxacum brevicorniculatum in four coordinated experiments. We then tested the consequences of transgenerational plasticity affecting competitive interactions of the offspring and ecosystem processes, such as decomposition. We found that, by promoting differences in DNA methylation, offspring of plants under stronger competition developed faster and presented more resource‐conservative phenotypes. Further, these adjustments associated with less degradable leaves, which have the potential to reduce nutrient turnover and might, in turn, favour plants with more conservative traits. Greater parental competition enhanced competitive abilities of the offspring, by triggering adaptive phenotypic plasticity, and decreased offspring leaf decomposability. Our results suggest that competition‐induced transgenerational effects could promote rapid adaptations and species coexistence and feed back on biodiversity assembly and nutrient cycling.",https://openalex.org/W3094948797,880647bcc951344f5d6d6ae7beb830838e0aff06,0,True,0.9479575157165527,0

Biotic relationships can be intra- or interspecific, positive or negative and cover a wide range of interactions, including predation, commensalism, mutualism, competition and parasitism. It is indicated that snake venoms, which are the best studied, attract the greatest attention of researchers. The role of predators in the formation of the structure and functioning of ecosystems is analyzed. It has been established that the predator–prey ecological interaction causes mutual physiological, morphological and behavioral adaptations at the individual, intra- and inter-species levels. It is noted that toxins are important adaptation that arose due to evolution. Representatives of venomous animals are present in every ecosystem, more than 250,000 species of animals use their venom for predation, as well as for defense and survival. Іnformation about the types of poisonous and venomous animals is summarized in the article. The composition of animal venoms and the pathological consequences of their influence are presented. It is noted that the lost of habitats, climate change and biological invasions pose a threat to ecological processes that are associated with the interaction between species. The importance of snakes for ecosystems, their significance for trophic network and regulating pests is highlighted. It was found that from an ecological point of view, snake venom is an important functional trait that mediates biotic interaction between several organisms.

Generally, divergence is assumed to occur when selection acts on the same, continuously varying trait in both species. However, selection might target multiple traits, and even closely related heterospecifics involved in character displacement might differ in selective targets. We investigated the targets of selection in a species of spadefoot toad, Spea multiplicata, during experimentally imposed competition with a congener, S. bombifrons. When examining traits separately, we found significant selection acting on multiple resource-acquisition traits. Yet, controlling for the independent effects of these traits in a multiple regression revealed that direct selection on a single trait might have contributed toward indirect selection on other correlated traits. Moreover, although we found evidence for plasticity in most traits, competition with S. bombifrons imposed selection on morphology and not on plasticity. Additional experiments suggest that the selective targets during character displacement might differ between the two species involved in this one instance of character displacement. Identifying the targets of competitively mediated selection is crucial, because whether and how character displacement ultimately unfolds depends on the nature of these targets and correlations among them.",https://openalex.org/W1882042664,630db8a71a3f75648629f6f645f0ea88d952d50b,0,True,0.9872004985809326,0

Research across diverse taxa suggest they may play important roles in population divergence and speciation. They may involve various kinds of traits, including morphological and behavioral traits and those related to life history. Many of the evolutionary, ecological, and genetic mechanisms producing and maintaining resource polymorphisms are similar among phylogenetically distinct species. Although further studies are needed, the genetic basis may be simple, in some cases under the control of a single locus, with phenotypic plasticity playing a proximate role in some taxa. Divergent selection including either directional, disruptive, or frequency-dependent selection is important in their evolution.

To explore effects of habitat patchiness and variation in perceived risk of predation on food-web dynamics, we conducted a factorial experiment in a model aquatic food chain of predator−prey−resource using 2 contrasting predators (adult blue crab Callinectes sapidus and toad fish Opsanus tau), juvenile blue crab as prey, and mussel Geukensia demissa as resource. Both predator presence and habitat patchiness influenced the prey's preference for consuming resources at patch edges instead of interiors. The preference of prey for consuming resources at habitat edges was 4 times stronger in continuous oyster reef habitat than in smaller habitat patches. This suggests that interior resources in continuous habitat experience a refuge from consumption, but this refuge is largely lost in patchy habitat. The mere presence of predators reduced the prey's preference for consuming resources at habitat edges. This BMIE was significant for the ambush predator (toadfish) and the treatment containing both predators, but not for the actively hunting predator (adult blue crab). We conclude that habitat patchiness and predator presence can jointly affect resource distribution by inducing shifts in prey foraging behavior, revealing a need to incorporate BMIEs into habitat fragmentation studies. This conclusion has broad and growing relevance as anthropogenic factors increasingly modify predator abundances and fragment coastal habitats.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029487,Selection against Accumulating Mutations in Niche-Preference Genes Can Drive Speciation,"Our current understanding of sympatric speciation is that it occurs primarily through disruptive selection on ecological genes driven by competition, followed by reproductive isolation through reinforcement-like selection against inferior intermediates/heterozygotes. Our evolutionary model of selection on resource recognition and preference traits suggests a new mechanism for sympatric speciation. We find speciation can occur in three phases. First a polymorphism of functionally different phenotypes is established through evolution of specialization. On the gene level, regulatory functions have evolved in which some alleles are conditionally switched off (i.e. are silent). These alleles accumulate harmful mutations that potentially may be expressed in offspring through recombination. Second mating associated with resource preference invades because harmful mutations in parents are not expressed in the offspring when mating assortatively, thereby dividing the population into two pre-zygotically isolated resource-specialist lineages. Third, silent alleles that evolved in phase one now accumulate deleterious mutations over the following generations in a Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller fashion, establishing a post-zygotic barrier to hybridization.",https://openalex.org/W2115242058,0e25a18b01af535f7a0fb2621719700201751362,0,True,0.9805545210838318,0

Climate factors interact with plant traits to mediate tree survival. This study investigated survival dynamics in Norway spruce (Picea abies) in relation to tree-level morphological traits during a prolonged multi-year outbreak of the bark beetle, Ips typographus, in Central Europe. We acquired datasets describing the trait attributes of individual spruce using remote sensing and field surveys. We used nonlinear regression in a hypothesis-driven framework to quantify survival probability as a function of tree size, crown morphology, intraspecific competition and a growing season water balance. Extant spruce trees that persisted through the outbreak were spatially clustered, suggesting that survival was a non-random process. Larger diameter trees were more susceptible to bark beetles, reflecting either life history tradeoffs or a dynamic interaction between defense capacity and insect aggregation behavior. Competition had a strong negative effect on survival, presumably through resource limitation. Trees with more extensive crowns were buffered against bark beetles, ostensibly by a more robust photosynthetic capability and greater carbon reserves. The outbreak spanned a warming trend and conditions of anomalous aridity. Sustained water limitation during this period amplified the consequences of other factors, rendering even smaller trees vulnerable to colonization by insects. Our results are in agreement with prior research indicating that climate change has the potential to intensify bark beetle activity. However, forest outcomes will depend on complex cross-scale interactions between global climate trends and tree-level trait factors, as well as feedback effects associated with landscape patterns of stand structural diversity.",https://openalex.org/W4281761255,1a5aa643dc354fe90b110608fe19eafd24686831,0,True,0.9824569225311279,0

https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12317,Density‐ and trait‐mediated effects of a parasite and a predator in a tri‐trophic food web,"Summary Despite growing interest in ecological consequences of parasitism in food webs, relatively little is known about effects of parasites on long‐term population dynamics of non‐host species or about whether such effects are density or trait mediated. We studied a tri‐trophic food chain comprised of (i) a bacterial basal resource ( S erratia fonticola ), (ii) an intermediate consumer ( P aramecium caudatum ), (iii) a top predator ( D idinium nasutum ) and (iv) a parasite of the intermediate consumer ( H olospora undulata ). A fully factorial experimental manipulation of predator and parasite presence/absence was combined with analyses of population dynamics, modelling and analyses of host ( P aramecium ) morphology and behaviour. Predation and parasitism each reduced the abundance of the intermediate consumer ( P aramecium ), and parasitism indirectly reduced the abundance of the basal resource ( S erratia ). However, in combination, predation and parasitism had non‐additive effects on the abundance of the intermediate consumer, as well as on that of the basal resource. In both cases, the negative effect of parasitism seemed to be effaced by predation. Infection of the intermediate consumer reduced predator abundance. Modelling and additional experimentation revealed that this was most likely due to parasite reduction of intermediate host abundance (a density‐mediated effect), as opposed to changes in predator functional or numerical response. Parasitism altered morphological and behavioural traits, by reducing host cell length and increasing the swimming speed of cells with moderate parasite loads. Additional tests showed no significant difference in D idinium feeding rate on infected and uninfected hosts, suggesting that the combination of these modifications does not affect host vulnerability to predation. However, estimated rates of encounter with S erratia based on these modifications were higher for infected Paramecium than for uninfected P aramecium. A mixture of density‐mediated and trait‐mediated indirect effects of parasitism on non‐host species creates rich and complex possibilities for effects of parasites in food webs that should be included in assessments of possible impacts of parasite eradication or introduction.",https://openalex.org/W2054928994,5c6d1a1d095cbc0df8bce3c5aaa3d6fb6f55be56,0,True,0.985050618648529,0
https://doi.org/10.53846/goediss-4521,"Intra- and interspecific variation of functional traits, growth performance and belowground competition in Populus species","Short-rotation forestry (SRF) systems provide sustaining resource supply that is needed to meet the rapidly increasing demand in wood products and renewable energy. Poplar species (Populus spp.) are frequently used for such plantations as they maintain high yield along wide environmental ranges. Specifically aspen (Populus tremula and P. tremuloides) reach considerable productivity even on poor soils and exhibit relatively high drought tolerance when compared to other taxa of the genus. However, the use of aspen in SRF systems is not well established. The aim of this study was to investigate the intra- and interspecific variation of above- and belowground functional traits which determine differences in environmental adaptation, drought tolerance, competitive strength and hence overall species performance in different aspen demes and two further poplar species (P. tremula and P. trichocarpa). This information may contribute to optimize yield and reducing the risk of failure in plantings under current and future climates. Major differences in functional above- and belowground traits of aspen demes of particular environmental adaptation became evident in the course of this study (Chapter 2). However, variance within the aspen fine root system properties is considerably high and above- and belowground trait correspondence remains inconsistent. Fine root properties are to a lesser extent related to genetic distance among demes than leaf-related properties. The high degree of plasticity in belowground (fine root) traits compared to aboveground traits implies a heterogeneous response to high spatial and temporal variability of belowground resources what may be of relevance for species growth performance. This may also explain why the variation in fine root morphological traits was not directly linked to differences in growth among the demes. Instead, much of the within-deme variation of the investigated root morphological traits may be explained by differentiating single root sections according to the hierarchical branching structure (root orders).The intraspecific variation in wood anatomical and hydraulic properties of branches and coarse roots in five genetically distinct demes were related to variation in aboveground productivity and drought resistance (Chapter 3). Genotypic differences in the dependence of growth on branch xylem hydraulic efficiency and on hydraulic safety (cavitation vulnerability) were found. By contrast, a large variation in coarse root anatomical and hydraulic traits did not determine growth performance or drought resistance among the demes but manifest in the observation of ‘high-conductivity roots’ with extraordinarily large vessels which state the functional heterogeneity within the poplar root system. Belowground competition effects on physiologically important fine root morphological and chemical properties of P. tremula and P. trichocarpa saplings along roots of different order and age were identified (Chapter 4). First, the strong control exerted by the root order position or the age of a root segment on different root traits became evident and enabled species differentiation according to the investigated traits. The minor influence of different competition treatments on fine root morphology and chemistry suggests that morphological adaptation in response to competition is not a mandatory phenomenon. Moreover, the comparison of harvest data (fine roots of the box interior) and direct root growth observations (at a transparent front plate) revealed a mismatch between the two types of data suggesting that root polymorphism may strongly impact the interpretation of rhizoscope data. This study is the first to describe the inherent complexity and heterogeneity of the poplar root system in its anatomy, morphology and function on an intraspecific as well as interspecific scale. Further experiments and detailed root analysis within long-term field studies are needed for a better understanding of belowground root-related processes in poplar species.",b3cd711af6192ba3397ac9cdc33e2217145eb7a8,b3cd711af6192ba3397ac9cdc33e2217145eb7a8,0,True,0.9189867377281189,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.14298,Towards closer integration between ecology and evolution,"Developing deeper links between ecology and evolution is not a new idea and has been advocating since at least the 1950s (Futuyma, 1986), but most 20th-century attempts can be considered more as rapprochement than actual integration (Huneman, 2019 for a detailed historical review). However, based on early isolated insights (e.g. Antonovics, 1976; Pimentel, 1961), the idea has been revivified over the last two decades, around the concepts of eco-evolutionary dynamics and feedbacks (Hendry, 2017). Significant efforts have indeed been made to percolate concepts and ideas between the two fields, especially across biodiversity levels (e.g. Hendry, 2017; Leibold & Chase, 2017; Loreau, 2010; Vellend, 2016), even if (i) more has been done at the population to community level than for higher levels of ecological organization (e.g. including ecosystem functioning) and (ii) analyses of reciprocal feedbacks remain rare compared to mainstream research in either field. The number of studies claiming to be ‘eco–evo’ has risen sharply (Bassar et al., 2021), even if most of these studies actually represent classical ‘eco’ or ‘evo’ approaches, raising the question of what eco–evo really is. The definition proposed by Bassar et al. (2021; see also Hendry, 2017, chapter 1) may serve as a baseline, built on the assumption that ecological and evolutionary processes occur at the same timescales because this allows for true eco-evolutionary dynamics (EED) and feedbacks. Fast global change (e.g. temperature increase; IPCC, 2023) leading to enhanced selective pressure is certainly a good reason for considering such EED, highlighting the fact that fast evolutionary dynamics can match fast environmental change (and fast biodiversity loss; Diaz & Malhi, 2022). From this definition, the debate can (and must) develop to integrate concepts, ideas and practices of ecology and evolution into EED, and this is what is proposed in this special issue (general outline in Figure 1), revivifying this debate by considering several themes: the first relies on biodiversity itself, with the idea of including all biodiversity levels (from molecule to biomes), all branches of the tree of life, and some overlooked aspects of variability. The other themes are concerned with extending the temporal (and implicitly spatial) frame in which biodiversity unfolds, considering the full range of forces and processes acting on biodiversity, and lastly revisiting concepts and extending models. Rather than commenting sequentially on each paper in this special issue, we have chosen a summary to gather the ideas and suggestions presented around these themes—all the more so as several articles contribute to multiple themes (Figure 1). They are not presented in order of importance, although some papers offer more general perspectives than others. Of course, this special issue does not exhaust the field of possibilities. Each paper suggests several avenues for further research, and we also mention (Conclusion) some additional research directions that are not considered here, but worth exploring. Biodiversity is classically considered hierarchically from molecules to ecosystems (or even biomes). While somewhat of a caricature, there is some truth in the view that the penetrance of evolutionary theory is much stronger at the level of the smallest entities (genes, populations), while ecological theories are generally more concerned with more complex entities (communities, ecosystems) (see the top left part in Figure 1). However, biodiversity levels are connected by multifarious links (e.g. selection, predation, variable environments), and EED can play a role at all levels with feedback between levels (Hendry, 2017; Loreau, 2010). This is a strong incentive to consider these dynamics across biodiversity levels. A first entry is proposed in this special issue by Yamamichi, Letten, and Schreiber (2023) who conduct an analysis of models in population genetics and community ecology following the general approach advocated by Vellend (2016): there are indeed clear parallels between, for example, selection and competition or gene flow and dispersal. They focus on the critical role of temporally fluctuating environments in maintaining variation both within and among species through fast EED. Drawing on Chesson (2000)'s theory of coexistence, they begin from a simple lottery model used in both fields to explore how the temporal storage effect affects both genetic and species diversity, incrementally complexifying this model to account for ‘reality’. This pedagogic approach may certainly be open beyond the storage effect to consider for example the respective role of genetic and ecological drift (Yamamichi, Letten, & Schreiber, 2023). The second entry, proposed by Calcagno et al. (2023), is to consider several biodiversity levels simultaneously through trophic chains. What constrains their complexity, and especially their length, is a central issue in ecology (Calcagno et al., 2011) and can be envisaged as a tension between top-down (e.g. predation) and habitat-selection effects in a metacommunity context, space being critical to account for their maintenance (Calcagno et al., 2011). Calcagno et al. (2023) introduce an ounce of evolution in this perspective, considering that dispersal rates can evolve under mutation pressure; this leads in general to longer food chains, depending on, for example, the competition-colonization trade-off among species. However, the benefit of evolution decreases when considering increasingly higher levels in food chains. Here, only dispersal evolves, and Calcagno et al. (2023) consider several worthy perspectives, such as for instance more complex descriptions of individual phenotypes than mean trait value. How dispersal evolution itself may affect the perturbation regime may also be worth taking into account for EED. A second aspect is to reconsider how the tree of life is dealt with in EED studies as well as in both ecology and evolution in general (Figure 1). To put it bluntly, microbes are overlooked, although they represent the bulk of biodiversity, and most studies are conducted on multicellular organisms (Loreau et al., 2023; Martiny et al., 2023). The point is not just that this is ‘unfair’, but that looking at the world from a microbial perspective drastically changes the meaning of eco-evolutionary dynamics. Indeed, let us imagine what the theories of ecology and evolution would have been if they had been written before the rise of multicellular organisms: disentangling ecology from evolution is difficult in the microbial realm if it even has any meaning. Indeed, the species concept poorly applies, and horizontal gene transfers are common, even if microbial Operational Taxonomic Units within communities are separated by much larger distances than in macro-organisms (Martiny et al., 2023). The fundamental differences made in macro-organisms between changes in species abundance and in genotype frequencies are therefore blurred. Microbes, no less than macro-organisms, can respond to environmental change with solutions going from rapid evolution to broad-scale community shifts, going up to those biogeochemical processes governing ecosystem functioning and dynamics, which implies a strong potential to lead to EED (Martiny et al., 2023). However, they are not indistinct players collectively expressing functional redundancy, and we should now dig deeper into their ecology and evolution in natural environments to fully make sense of their role. Recent work has shown that it is for example possible to quantify dispersal and evaluate its impact on decomposition processes in soils (Martiny et al., 2023). The last aspect regarding biodiversity is some facets of variability, within and among species, that have been overlooked in EED (Figure 1). Variability is needed for evolution to proceed, and its maintenance is a central issue in both evolution and ecology, in particular as a resilience mechanism under unpredictable environmental conditions. Variance is certainly a key concept in ecological studies above the species level but has been essentially considered among species (Violle et al., 2012). Yet, we are not short of studies analysing trait variance within species in population biology. However, studies assessing rates of phenotypic change focus on population mean trait values, while their variance might be as significant for EED. Contributing to filling this gap is the goal of Sanderson et al. (2023), based on a compilation of both trait means and variances measured in context of environmental changes. Means and variances are globally positively correlated, and the distribution of genetic and phenotypic variances is also very similar. No general patterns for phenotypic variance emerge among different types of environmental changes, or traits, rendering prediction of future phenotypic trends difficult. Sanderson et al. (2023) conclude that much has still to be done to build more ambitious datasets on a wide range of organisms, but also to link this variance to environmental variance, a pre-requisite to EED studies. Part of this variance is due to phenotypic plasticity, and here again, a plethora of studies have been conducted (Pfennig, 2021). However, how phenotypic plasticity can contribute to EED through propagating effects in ecological networks remains to be evaluated. Gómez et al. (2023) explore more specifically in this special issue how plasticity contributes to expand or shift the interaction niche, or even cause the colonization of new niches. This may lead to the topology of ecological networks being rewired, an aspect that is open to empirical evaluation through metrics such as nestedness or modularity. That individual plasticity may percolate to affect various key characteristics of networks confronted with environmental perturbations, such as resistance to invasions, is an interesting perspective (Gómez et al., 2023). Whether plasticity may be defined at network scale and submitted to selection is more contentious. A full analysis should also specify how plasticity may drive EED in actual cases. Perhaps, more ambitious is the idea of considering stoichiometry as a key part of variability (El-Sabaawi et al., 2023)—ecological stoichiometry studies how the relative supply and demand of essential elements, such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, influence biological interactions (Elser et al., 2000). It contributed largely to our understanding of ecosystem functioning (Van de Waal et al., 2018), but not so much to EED. Here, El-Sabaawi et al. (2023) propose to develop organismal stoichiometry to access an understudied aspect of the phenotype. This ‘elemental phenotype’ integrates body elemental content, and how these elements are acquired, assimilated, allocated or released and exhibits much intraspecific variation, leading to selective pressures. Beyond providing a direct link between population biology and fluxes of matter in ecosystems, this idea opens connections to the notion of functional traits (Loranger et al. 2016), also considered integrators between ecological and evolutionary processes (Hendry, 2017), as well as to a whole body of evolutionary theory on resource allocation (Charnov, 1993; Stearns, 1992). The ‘elemental phenotype’ perspective includes connections with species interactions as well, and therefore, a wide range of ecological processes through cascading effects in trophic chains. Bassar et al. (2021) argued that genuine eco-evo dynamics can only unfold when ecology and evolution proceed at the same timescale. However, they implicitly assumed that both were fast because they focused on ongoing processes. Fronhofer et al. (2023) enlarge the picture by extending the idea to any timescale and considering the dynamics of biological systems in a two-dimensional space—the two axes representing respectively the speed of ecology and evolution (Figure 1). In this framework, ecology and evolution sensu stricto can be redefined by their relative speed with regard to evolution and ecology respectively (Figure 1). More importantly, this means that change of states in Figure 1 can occur whenever modulators modify ecological and evolutionary rates—such modulators can be factors external to the biological systems (e.g. environmental temperature) or internal to them (e.g. new genetic variation, itself influenced by external factors). EED may therefore emerge when rate modulators synchronize the speed of ecology and evolution. This framework also extends Hutchinson (1965)'s analogy (the ecological theatre and the evolutionary play): time is the theatre in which ecology and evolution are two interacting players. Fronhofer et al. (2023)'s proposal undermines the usual ‘slow evolution/fast ecology' wisdom that served for decades as a ‘good reason’ for not considering ecology and evolution together. It also calls for reconsidering the ‘time-scale separation’ classically used in EED models based, for example, on the adaptive dynamics approach (see Calcagno et al., 2023). This approach considers weak selection on traits and assumes that evolution is much slower than ecology in order to facilitate model analysis (Calcagno et al., 2023; Lion et al., 2023; Yamamichi, Letten, & Schreiber, 2023). The new approach to trait modelling—oligomorphic dynamics—by Lion et al. (2023, detailed below) is a way of overcoming this problem while addressing the question of eco–evo prediction at temporal scales beyond the few generations that quantitative genetics can offer. A significant contribution, no doubt, to predicting EED under a regime of rapid environmental change. Yamamichi, Ellner, and Hairston (2023) argue that evolution in EED studies has too often focused on a reduced set of forces (i.e. strong selection, negligible phenotypic variances, large genetic effects on ecological variables; see Bassar et al., 2021). They discuss several aspects that should be deepened, insisting on the role of mutation and genetic drift. For example, we know that deleterious mutations can drive populations to extinction (mutational meltdown; Lynch et al., 1995), but the role of genetic drift remains to be sorted out to fully understand how ‘evolution may save’ populations when environmental variation drives down demography (evolutionary rescue). Yamamichi, Ellner, and Hairston (2023) also point out that too much emphasis has been put on directional and balancing selection (Figure 1), and not enough on disruptive selection (see also Lion et al., 2023). Assuming similar speeds for evolution and ecology, an open question is how lineage diversification (or even fusing after diversification) is affected by disruptive selection, both in the short- and long-term, providing a link between microevolution and macroevolution (see also Fronhofer et al., 2023). As mentioned above, temporal variation (and the storage effect; Yamamichi, Letten, & Schreiber, 2023) and phenotypic plasticity (Gómez et al., 2023) are also critical processes to be considered. The modulators of ecological and evolutionary rates introduced by Fronhofer et al. (2023) provide a general umbrella term to account for the fact that we should consider not only those forces and processes but also the speed at which they may change. In this approach to EDD through forces and processes (Figure 1), Kim et al. (2023) propose another, more applied, angle of attack, based on an arguably contentious issue, that is, the use of gene drive technology to introduce genes of interest into natural populations. The argument is simple: the spread of genes should be so fast that it can occur over timescales similar to many ecological processes, as in situations where there is strong selection. Kim et al. (2023) describe the key forces and processes that should be accounted for in future studies, for example, population structure or the rise of gene drive in other species on the evolutionary side and environmental variation on the ecological side. The strong economic pressure to release these technologies from the laboratory into the field certainly calls for an EED approach to better understand and manage the associated risks. Considering other forces and processes in the previous section (Yamamichi, Ellner, & Hairston, 2023) is certainly a call to develop new models of EED. We already saw the conceptual gain derived from considering the possibility that the colonization rate can evolve in models of food-chain length (Calcagno et al., 2023), and how models can be derived from analogous forces at both the population and community levels to account for the temporal storage effect (Yamamichi, Letten, & Schreiber, 2023). What Lion et al. (2023) propose is perhaps even more ambitious by opening a door to integrate the two major theoretical approaches used to model traits and their evolution, namely adaptive dynamics (AD) and quantitative genetics (QG). In a simplified presentation, QG assumes that traits have a normal distribution, and AD often results in bivariate distributions. To get rid of the Gaussian straitjacket and drawing on Sasaki and Dieckmann (2011), Lion et al. (2023) introduce ‘oligomorphic dynamics’—the basic idea is to decompose a multimodal trait distribution into a sum of narrow unimodal distributions, each peak corresponding to a morph and being characterized by its frequency and statistical moments (Figure 1). This elegant approach, developed here using simple models, displays several advantages, among others the possibility to consider EED at much larger timescale than QG or to account for the dynamical nature of genetic variance. It can also take into account population regulation through frequency- and density-dependent selection induced by environmental change (see also Yamamichi, Letten, & Schreiber, 2023). Lion et al. (2023) also suggest that this approach should facilitate a much tighter integration between eco-evolutionary theory and empirical data. Much exciting work in perspective! Advances in the eco-evolutionary field could also come from the judicious extension of concepts from ecology and evolution. For example, Nosil et al. (2021)) suggested that resilience, a concept borrowed from ecosystem studies (Holling, 1973), can fruitfully be used to analyse the stability of evolutionary systems. Here, Loreau et al. (2023) go the other way around by showing that adaptation, a concept typically associated with evolutionary theory, could be considered above the species level (Figure 1). The idea is to generalize adaptation to any process that results in improved performance as a response to environmental change in a multilevel hierarchical perspective. Loreau et al. (2023) consider facets of this certainly contentious idea, such as how to measure performance (fitness in evolutionary parlance) and its connection with group and multi-level selection. Perhaps, the idea might be even more relevant to unicellular organisms, given the blurred boundaries between their ecology and evolution (Loreau et al., 2023; Martiny et al., 2023). The border between ecology and evolution is a vast domain, and this special issue of course did not explore it fully. Here, we sketch out a few further directions and themes that could fruitfully be pursued. First, technological tools (e.g. omics and environmental sensors/probes) used by evolutionary biologists and ecologists are serving as common objects for a dialogue between the two communities. Although they were not covered explicitly here, the idea runs through most papers of the special issue. Second, fitness is the currency used in evolutionary biology and energy that is used by the most functional parts of ecology. Rather abstract frameworks have been proposed to link fitness and energy (entropy) in evolutionary biology (e.g. Frank, 2009). The approach of Brown et al. (2018), connecting energy use, traits and environment, is open to empirical evaluation, and might be pursued for understanding EED. Third, micro-organisms represent interactive interfaces between macro-organisms and their environment, which is encapsulated in the holobiont concept (Simon et al., 2019). Both evolutionary and ecological paradigms are required to make sense of holobiont dynamics with echoes here in the contributions of Loreau et al. (2010) and Martiny et al. (2023), for example, on the notion of transmission units. Last, but not least, biodiversity management in a world of very fast and deleterious environmental changes should harness an eco-evolutionary framework and perspective (Sarrazin & Leconte, 2016), not only to manage the current problems but also to offer some hope for the future.

https://doi.org/10.1111/raq.12952,Mitigating the role of aquaculture in crustacean invasions,"Aquaculture plays a critical role in alleviating malnutrition and poverty1 and stands as the world's fastest growing food sector,2 especially in developing countries.3 Global aquaculture production increased by over 600% from 1990 to 2020,4 accompanied by a diversification of farmed species, reaching 425 species in 2021.5 Notably, the number of crustacean species reared commercially has risen from 30 to at least 49 between 2017 and 2020.4, 6 Many farmed species are non-native in their farmed regions, a trend first observed in 2000 in developing countries such as Cuba, India, Philippines, Chile and Brazil, where 60%–95% of all production is non-native species.7 The growing number of farms and/or farm sizes, along with non-native species farming, increases the risk of intentional or accidental release into the wild.3 This is likely to increase propagule pressure8 as was seen with the redclaw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) which escaped from captivity or abandoned farms and established wild populations in many regions.9 Farmed species are selected for traits which exacerbate their establishment and spread in the wild10 such as rapid growth, broad diet and resistance to parasite.11 Biological invasions, involving human-related introduction, establishment, expansion and potential impact of species outside of their native ecosystem, pose a significant threat to biodiversity and ecosystem functions.12 For example, the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) introduced for aquaculture, is now a global invasive species13 which transmits diseases14 and predates on and competes with native species, thereby altering food webs and habitat structures.15 Notwithstanding biological invasions occasional benefits, they do not outweigh their massive economic impacts,16 estimated to be at least USD 423 billions in damage and management,12 also affecting aquaculture itself.17 The signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and the European green crab (Carcinus maenas), collectively inflict damages totalling US $271 million.17 We suggest that the rapid development of farms and farmed species is likely to increase the risk of biological invasion18 unless new biosecurity protocols are developed in parallel.19 While the causal links between aquaculture and biological invasions have been extensively studied for specific countries or species,20-23 substantial gaps remain not least in the case of crustaceans, which are significant both as major aquaculture species and as invaders. Therefore, we focus on farmed crustaceans, although our conclusions apply to other taxonomic groups involved in aquaculture. We show why some farmed crustaceans pose an increasing risk of biological invasions and how this risk can be mitigated. Here, we assess commercially farmed crustaceans classifying them by country (native-non-native) and invasive history (lack or presence of invasions historically). Using these classifications, we recommend biosecurity and management strategies while highlighting the gaps in our current understanding. To compile a comprehensive list of farmed crustacean species, we used the most up to date aquaculture dataset of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations24 (FAO) and supplemented it with our own literature research. For identifying the invasive crustacean species, we cross referenced multiple invasive alien species databases25-28 ensuring we removed duplicates and validated scientific names using GBIF. Our final dataset includes 63 crustacean species (Appendix S1 & S2) which have been farmed in 126 different countries globally (Table 1; Appendix S3). Here, non-native species are defined as a species outside its natural range in the country where it is farmed. Of these countries, 111 have farmed at least 1 non-native species with 64 farming exclusively non-native species and 15 that farm only native species (Table 1). The whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) is the most widely farmed species, cultivated across 54 countries (Table 2; Appendix S3). The signal crayfish has only been farmed in non-native countries whereas the giant mud crab (Scylla serrata) has been farmed only in native countries (Appendix S3). Out of the 63 farmed species, 22 are considered invasive worldwide impacting at least 77 countries (Table 1; Appendix S1 and S4). Here, we define invasive as actual or probable negative ecological or economic impact documented in at least one population worldwide. The red swamp and the spiny-cheek (Faxonius limosus) crayfishes are invasive in over 20 countries (Table 2). There are several pathways by which crustaceans have been shown to spread including ballast water, pet trade and hull fouling (Table 2). However, it is established that aquaculture is a major driver/pathway in invasion crustaceans with at least 19 of the 22 invasive species introduced through aquaculture (Table 2, Appendix S5), 14 of those affecting at least 30 countries (Table 1; Appendix S4). Causes of their introduction include unintentional escape (e.g. when used as fish food49), intentional release from crustacean aquaculture31, 51 or transfer through 'hitchhiking' on other species as was the case with the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis).42, 65, 66 It is important to note that these results are likely underestimated due to the incomplete reporting of both farming and invasions.

Human activities (infrastructure, agriculture). Ecosystem change or habitat alteration Human health Threat to or loss of native species64 These 22 invasive crustaceans farmed in aquaculture originate from diverse regions and environments including marine, brackish, and freshwater85 (Appendix S1). Their introductions into non-native regions have resulted to multiple and severe impacts (Table 2). For instance, the European green crab and Chinese mitten crab outcompete and prey on native species, leading to native population declines; consequently, they are listed among '100 of the worst invasive alien species'.67 Four of these 22 species are also listed on the European list of invasive alien species of concern, the spiny-cheek crayfish, the red swamp crayfish, the signal crayfish, and the Chinese mitten crab.68 The types of impacts and associated mechanisms of these invasive crustaceans are diverse (Table 2). Tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon) and red swamp crayfish are vectors of viral diseases such as the white spot syndrome baculovirus.69 Crayfish also transmit crayfish plague caused by the oomycete Aphanomyces astaci, listed among the 100 worst invasive alien species globally.67 Some crustaceans are considered ecosystem engineers15, 70 that can significantly impact the structure of invaded habitats, thereby affecting other species and altering ecosystem dynamics. The European green crab reduces eelgrass biomass by damaging rhizomes and plant shoots while burrowing for shelter and prey.71 Similarly, the red swamp crayfish alters water quality, increasing turbidity and reducing dissolved oxygen levels.72 These invasive crustaceans can also impact economic activities such as aquaculture, fisheries and agriculture.17 The burrowing behaviour of the common yabby (Cherax destructor) can jeopardize dam walls, thus affecting farmers.73 In Lake Naivasha, local fishermen estimated that the red swamp crayfish reduced their catch's food provisioning by up to 30% due to crayfish-induced damage to fishing nets.74 Thus, the risk on human activities results in massive economic consequences since four crabs— the blue crab, the European green crab (Carcinus maenas), the Chineese mitten crab and the blue swimmer crab (Portunus pelagicus)—and three crayfish species—the red swamp crayfish, the signal crayfish and the spiny-cheeck crayfish. —farmed in aquaculture rank among the costliest invasive crustaceans.17 Despite the acknowledged risks, there is still no global picture of the risk posed by farmed crustacean species in aquaculture. As a first step to address this gap, we propose a simple but widely applicable classification system based on two primary criteria: (1) the species documented global invasion history, and (2) whether the species is farmed outside its native regions. This system creates four possible outcomes, which we used to create a preliminary risk index ranging from limited risk (A) to high (D) (Figure 1). Species farmed in their native range are of low concern if escaped populations establish outside the farm (category A), but of medium concern if they are invasive in other (non-native) range (category B). Conversely, species farmed outside their native range and never reported as invasive (category C) have a high risk of becoming invasive if they escape and establish. The highest concern is for species farmed outside their native range and with a documented invasion history (category D). As a preliminary decision and in the absence of more in-depth risk assessments, we suggest applying appropriate management measures of the 63 farmed crustacean species based on their classification. Species with the lowest risk classifications (category A & B), which total 39 species, can continue to be farmed in their native regions, focusing biosecurity efforts on international transport. The seven species farmed in non-native countries (category C), require appropriate biosecurity and monitoring measures to prevent escapes from farms or transports. For the 17 species classified in the highest-risk category (D), farming in non-native regions must be avoided. Selecting species for aquaculture that minimize biological invasion risks while boosting economic potential is crucial. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize farming species within their native regions (A & B),10 particularly for open pond water farming. However, it is important to note that even native species can have detrimental impacts if released in large quantities.75 Farming species outside their native region may only be safe if not only species are reared in enclosed structures but also if current and future environmental conditions are unfavourable to their invasiveness. The current and future risks of establishment of non-native species can be predicted with tools such as species distribution models. Thus, conducting local or national spatial prediction analyses before establishing farms may allow the building of non-native farming while lowering the risk that species becomes invasive.76 Biosecurity and early response (following regular monitoring) are the most effective ways of managing non-native species.12, 77 The most basic approaches include: (i) farming sterile or unisex individuals, (ii) isolating farms with closed structures away from natural aquatic habitats, (iii) implementing clean-up protocols and special attire to prevent the spread of eggs and contaminants, (iv) using adequate equipment such as nets to prevent individual escape (e.g., through predation), including equipment maintenance to prevent long-term breakdowns and (v) regularly monitoring surrounding regions.78, 79 Risks are further reduced through tailored risk assessments20, 80, 81 and updating laws31 and regulations at different scales.20, 31, 82 For example, the four species in the European list of invasive alien species68 are forbidden to be farmed.83 We acknowledge that in many cases the long-term negative consequences of biological invasions may be disregarded because of the immediate social and economic benefits of aquaculture or a lack of awareness of the impacts. Our objective here was to highlight these consequences and promote responsible choices in aquaculture, such as selecting native species or implementing specific biosecurity measures, to collectively progress towards sustainable aquaculture with a reduced role in biological invasions. The classification we proposed serves this objective by informing about the risks posed by farmed aquaculture crustacean species. While based on current knowledge, it could be refined as more gaps in our understanding are addressed. Firstly, not all countries farming these crustaceans are currently present in the FAO dataset.24 Examples include Venezuela and Brazil which are not present in the FAO despite farming the tiger prawn, also invasive there.84 The efficient reporting of newly farmed species to the FAO dataset also varies, mostly by country. Secondly, there are species level gaps in the dataset, one example being the brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) which is not included in FAO as of now. Additionally, the FAO often provides information at higher taxonomic levels such as genus or family, thus complicating the identification of all farmed crustaceans, including potentially invasive ones. For instance, the Metapenaeus genus may include one of two invasive alien species of this taxonomic group. Our study may also underestimate the extent of farms located in non-native regions due to uncertainties in the native regions of some species. This is a problem particularly acute in very large countries (e.g., Australia, Brazil, Russia, USA, China) where farming is reported at the national level, whereas a species is native to specific parts of the country. For example, the smooth marron (Cherax cainii) is native to parts of Australia but invasive in others. Further, delays in detecting invasive species in the wild and in quantifying their impact hinder our ability to categorize species as invasive accurately. Finally, information on unregistered or illegal farms is lacking,9 making it difficult to assign accurate risk categories to some species. Consequently, we cannot rely solely on this dataset to assign a risk category to a given species. Our classification is presented more to illustrate our proposal, enhance understanding of invasion risks related to farmed species crustacean species, assist in prioritizing containment strategies, and inform the selection of future farming locations and species. This approach is also relevant for other farmed aquatic groups like molluscs or fish.

https://doi.org/10.1111/OIK.03157,Associational resistance or susceptibility: the indirect interaction between chemically‐defended and non‐defended herbivore prey via a shared predator,"Many organisms possess chemical defences against their natural enemies, which render them unpalatable or toxic when attacked or consumed. These chemically-defended organisms commonly occur in communities with non- or less-defended prey, leading to indirect interactions between prey species, mediated by natural enemies. Although the importance of enemy-mediated indirect interactions have been well documented (e.g., apparent competition), how the presence of prey chemical defences may affect predation of non-defended prey in terrestrial communities remains unclear. Here, an experimental approach was used to study the predator-mediated indirect interaction between a chemically-defended and non-defended pest aphid species. Using laboratory-based mesocosms, aphid community composition was manipulated to include chemically-defended (CD) aphids (Brevicoryne brassicae), non-defended (ND) aphids (Myzus persicae) or a mixed assemblage of both species, on Brassica oleracea cabbage plants, in the presence or absence of a shared predator (Chrysoperla carnea larvae). Aphid population growth rates, aphid distributions on host plants and predator growth rates were measured. In single-species treatments, C. carnea reduced M. persicae population growth rate, but had no significant impact on B. brassicae population growth rate, suggesting B. brassicae chemical defences are effective against C. carnea. C. carnea had no significant impact on either aphid species population growth rate in mixed-species treatments. M. persicae (ND) therefore experienced reduced predation in the presence of B. brassicae (CD) through a predator-mediated indirect effect. Moreover, predator growth rates were significantly higher in the M. persicae-only treatments than in either the B. brassicae-only or mixed-species treatments, suggesting predation was impaired in the presence of B. brassicae (CD). A trait-mediated indirect interaction is proposed, consistent with associational resistance, in which the predator, upon incidental consumption of chemically-defended aphids is deterred from feeding, releasing non-defended aphids from predatory control.",abf65e95003853c048d12910944671c3cfddb93f,abf65e95003853c048d12910944671c3cfddb93f,0,True,0.9366354942321777,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.12010,"Linking ecological niche, community ecology and biogeography: insights from a mechanistic niche model","Abstract Aim We present a mechanistic niche model that integrates the demography of competing plant species in a metabolic, stochastic framework. In order to explore the model's ability to generate multiple species and community patterns, we assessed trait composition, richness gradients and spatial distributions of species ranges and abundances of simulated communities. Location Hypothetical, sloped plane. Methods Stage‐structured populations of species differing in traits and habitat requirements competed for space in a grid‐based model. Demographic processes (recruitment, reproduction, mortality, dispersal) and resource competition were explicitly simulated. Demographic rates and carrying capacity followed metabolic constraints. We simulated 50 species pools until reaching stable communities. Species pools were initialized with 400 species that had random traits and habitat requirements. The habitat requirements generated potential distributions of richness, range and abundance, whereas the simulations yielded realized distributions. Results The communities assembled in the simulations consisted of species spread non‐randomly within trait space. Potential species richness peaked at mid‐elevations, whereas realized richness was slightly shifted towards higher elevations. For 11% of all species, the highest local abundances were found not in the most suitable habitat, but in suboptimal conditions. 53% of all species could not fill the climatically determined potential range. The ability to fill the potential range was significantly influenced by species traits (e.g. body mass and Allee effects) and species richness. Main conclusions Spatial and trait properties of surviving species and of equilibrium communities diverged from the potential distributions. Realized richness gradients were consistent both with patterns observed in nature and those expected from null models based on geometrical constraints. However, the divergences between potential and realized patterns of richness, ranges and abundances indicate the importance of demography and biotic interaction for generating patterns at species and community levels. Consequently, bias in correlative habitat models and single‐species mechanistic models may arise if competition and demography are neglected. Additionally, competitive exclusion provides a mechanistic explanation for the low transferability of single‐species niche models. These results confirm the usefulness of mechanistic niche models for guiding further research integrating ecological niche, community ecology and biogeography.",https://openalex.org/W2105322043,120618092fe72099145179876a569be63ffdcb48,0,True,0.955646812915802,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/mms.13217,Depredation in Jamaica: An example of behavioral innovation in common bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>),"Behavioral innovation, which may occur through the discovery of novel information, the creation of new behavioral patterns, or the performance of established behavioral patterns in a novel context may give rise to advantageous traits in order to adjust to new environmental and social conditions (e.g., Reader & Laland, 2001; Reader & Laland, 2002). The development of more efficient foraging tactics is a form of behavioral innovation that may allow for the exploitation of food resources that are temporal or patchily distributed across large home ranges (McLean, 2001) and present in diverse ecosystems (e.g., Díaz López, 2006; Duffy-Echevarria et al., 2008; Hoese, 1971; Lewis & Schroeder, 2003; Noke & Odell, 2002; Patterson & Mann, 2011; Rossbach & Herzing, 1997; Visser, 2000). The development of novel foraging behaviors to exploit resources generated by human activities has been reported for many wild animals, including cetaceans (e.g., Noke & Odell, 2002), birds (e.g., Ducatez et al., 2013), and primates (e.g., Warren, 2008). For example, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) are particularly adept at developing innovative foraging behaviors based on the resources available in their environments, including using sponges to protect their rostra while searching for prey along the sea floor (Smolker et al., 1997) and stranding themselves on mud banks to feed on fish (Duffy-Echevarria et al., 2008). The development of new foraging behaviors by bottlenose dolphins has also been impacted by fishing practices, resulting in the development of new foraging tactics targeting the fisheries (e.g., Cantor et al., 2023; Noke & Odell, 2002). While behavioral plasticity may allow bottlenose dolphins to better adapt to changes within their environment (Brakes & Dall, 2016), it may also provide the context for human-wildlife conflict with the potential to negatively impact both humans and wildlife (Woodroffe et al., 2005). One example of a behavior associated with man-made resource exploitation, and conflict between humans and wildlife, is fishing gear depredation, that is, the removal of or damage to, captured fish or bait by marine predators (Zollett & Read, 2006). Depredation has been observed in marine predators, including sharks (e.g., MacNeil et al., 2009), pinnipeds (e.g., Ferrari et al., 2015), and cetaceans (e.g., Zollett & Read, 2006). While depredation is costly for humans, it may allow wild animals to exploit new prey items (e.g., Visser, 2000; Zollett & Read, 2006), consume preferred prey species (e.g., Noke & Odell, 2002; Rechimont et al., 2018), and develop more efficient foraging tactics (e.g., Chávez-Martínez et al., 2022; Díaz López, 2006; Zollett & Read, 2006). Depredation, however, may also come at a cost to the animals by increasing the risk of entanglement in fishing gear (Silva et al., 2002; Werner et al., 2015), the potential ingestion of fishing equipment (Ðuras Gomerčić et al., 2009), and possible retaliation by fishers (Visser, 2000). Jamaica's coastal waters are considered overfished, resulting in changes in species composition from commercially high-valued to less-valued, lower trophic level fish species, and decreases in average fish size and annual catch (Aiken & Kong, 2000; Klomp et al., 2003; Miller et al., 1996). Since at least 2000, fishers in Jamaica have reported depredation by dolphins (Aiken & Pal, 2008) as an additional impact to the fishery, noting that dolphins removed fish from fishing nets and Antillean Z-shaped fish traps (an all wooden-framed structure covered with galvanized wire mesh forming two funnel entrances [Munro et al., 1971]) (Figure 1). The perceived threat to their livelihoods has resulted in some fishers threatening to harm dolphins (Aiken & Pal, 2008; O'Sullivan personal observation). Aiken and Pal's (2008) report of this behavior, however, was based on fisher accounts and did not provide definitive evidence of the described behavior, making it difficult to develop possible mitigation measures. A recent report documenting opportunistic sightings of depredation events (Burge et al., 2023), as well as more systematic studies, may provide insight into the development of this behavior and effective mitigation measures. Here, we report underwater observations of this depredation behavior by common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in Westmoreland, Jamaica. In 2015, Antillean Z-shaped fish traps in Montego Bay, St. James and Bluefields, Westmoreland were monitored using high-definition video cameras (GoPro Hero 3+, GoPro, Inc., CA, USA) deployed by SCUBA divers. The cameras were placed adjacent to (<10 m) the traps and connected to custom-made casings containing alkaline D-cell batteries, allowing up to 20 h of continuous recording (Figure 2). Four cameras (one per trap) were deployed simultaneously every day at two sites along the coast of Jamaica: Montego Bay, St. James (May 16–19, 2015) and Bluefields, Westmoreland (May 21–30 and December 8–17, 2015) in waters with an average depth of 22 and 9 m, respectively, on either sand adjacent to reefs, seagrass beds, or both. Montego Bay, Bluefields and a third site were chosen to represent areas along the north, west, and south coasts of the island, respectively, in areas where depredation had been reported. However, poor weather at the proposed third field site prevented data collection there but allowed for a longer monitoring period in Bluefields in May. Additional data were collected in Bluefields in December in order to document additional instances of depredation. Camera deployment sites were determined after discussions with local fishers in order to identify the areas where depredation was most likely to occur. Fishers gave permission for their traps, and fishing sites, to be used (Figure 3). Video recordings (30 fps, 1920 × 720 or 1920 × 1080 pixel resolution) were visualized at either 2× or 5× the normal speed to detect the presence of dolphins and fishing gear interactions. A total of 1345.5 h of underwater video (Montego Bay: 108.5 h; Bluefields: 1237.0 h) was recorded across the two field seasons at both sites. Of these, only 704.3 h (Montego Bay: 88.5 h; Bluefields: 615.8 h) corresponded to daylight hours and were used for analysis. Technical issues with the camera equipment while monitoring in Montego Bay accounted for the reduced number of hours recorded there. The inspection of video recordings revealed one event of a bottlenose dolphin inspecting a fish trap in Montego Bay, but no depredation took place. In Bluefields, 11 depredation events were recorded, showing at least one bottlenose dolphin interfering with a fish trap. Thirteen events of bottlenose dolphins inspecting traps, without trying to extract fish, were also documented (Table 1). Single dolphins were recorded interacting with the traps in all but two of the depredation events. The other two depredation events occurred with groups of three dolphins. The depredation rate calculated for Bluefields, inclusive of the unsuccessful attempts, was estimated to be 0.011 events/trap/day in May and 0.004 events/trap/day in December. The mean duration dolphins spent with a trap during a depredation event was 165 s (32–378), and the mean amount of time spent inspecting the traps without interaction was 7 s (1–31). Nine of the 11 recorded depredation events involved one dolphin attempting to extract fish from a trap in an upright position. In one instance, one dolphin manipulated the trap into an upright position allowing all three members of the group to attempt to extract fish from the trap. In another event, a single dolphin unsuccessfully attempted to extract fish from a trap that had previously been turned by another individual earlier in the day. The two depredation events that did not require the manipulation of the trap into an upright position included a single dolphin, within a group of three, extracting a fish through the trap's mesh without changing the trap's orientation, and a single dolphin which turned a trap, with a buoy attached to it, on its side. The manipulation of the traps occurred in one of two ways. In a one-step procedure, the dolphin used its rostrum to lift the shortest edge of the trap into an upright position while thrusting its fluke (Figure 4; Video S1). In a two-step procedure, the dolphin used its rostrum to push the longest edge of the trap upwards so that the trap rested on its side, before lifting the trap upwards by pushing the shorter edge into an upright position (Figure 5, Video S2). The former method was used during six of the nine recorded attempts, while the latter method was used during the remaining three. In the case where a float had been attached to the trap, the dolphin pushed the trap on its side but did not attempt the second step. In three cases, a dolphin re-balanced a trap that was about to fall down due to wave surges (e.g., Video S1). After manipulating the trap into an upright position, dolphins swam around the trap, apparently herding the fish inside toward the trap's openings. In three cases, a dolphin re-oriented the trap by rotating it vertically by 180° in order to catch additional fish (e.g., Video S1). At the end of most of the depredation events, the traps were left upright, preventing the catch of additional fish. Unlike the fisher reports documented in Aiken and Pal (2008), no damage to the traps was observed during any of the recorded dolphin interactions, and none of the traps were rolled into deeper waters. While in some cases dolphins appeared to extract all the fish from the trap, there were instances when fish were left in the trap after depredation. Due to the distance between the camera and the fishing gear, it was impossible to confidently ascertain which fish species were extracted, or left in the trap. However, in the opportunistic reports documented in Burge et al. (2023), ocean surgeon (Acanthurus tractus) and tomtate (Haemulon aurolineatum) were observed being taken. The distance between the camera and the traps, as well as the position of the dolphin during the depredation event sometimes made it difficult to determine how the fish were obtained. In most cases, the dolphins appeared to consume the fish once they had exited the trap, either chasing the fish once they had left or grabbing them as soon as they had exited the trap. However, there were some instances where the fish might have been extracted through the mesh of the trap. In most of the depredation events, as well as the instances where dolphins only swam past and inspected the traps, it was difficult to document distinct features for most of the dolphins in order to determine how many distinct individuals had been documented feeding from the traps. One individual, however, had distinctive marks and was documented on three occasions depredating traps, as well as swimming past traps on four separate occasions. This individual was found in both groups of three dolphins and was the dolphin that extracted the fish from the trap without manipulating it, as well as the dolphin that turned the trap upright before the other two dolphins attempted to extract fish. This individual also used both the one- and two-step processes when manipulating the trap. While the quality of the videos and the absence of distinctive marks on some dolphins precluded estimating the number of observed individuals engaged in this behavior, we documented at least two animals depredating fish traps. In seven of the 11 recorded depredation events the sex of the animal engaged in depredation was determined to be male, based on visual inspection of the genital area, the absence of mammary slits, and the position of the genital and anal slits. In the other instances, the sex of the animal could not be determined based on the position of the camera, quality of the video, and the movements of the animal. Bottlenose dolphins have been known to depredate using a variety of fishing methods including gillnets, driftnets, longlines, trammel nets, crab pots, and trawling (e.g., Alexandre et al., 2022; Bonizzoni et al., 2022; Goetz et al., 2014; Noke & Odell, 2002; Pardalou & Tsikliras, 2020; Rechimont et al., 2018; Zollett & Read, 2006). The extraction of fish from Antillean Z-shaped fish traps adds to the diversity of the methods documented across the species' global distribution. Bottlenose dolphins have been reported to possess sophisticated cognitive abilities such as tool use (Smolker et al., 1997), mirror self-recognition (Reiss & Marino, 2001), the ability to understand symbols and other external representations (Herman et al., 1984; Herman & Forestell, 1985), cultural transmission (Krützen et al., 2005), and cooperation when solving a novel task (King et al., 2021; Kuczaj II et al., 2015). Bottlenose dolphin's cognitive abilities may allow them to adapt to localized environmental characteristics within their geographic range, optimizing their foraging success. These cognitive abilities may also facilitate the learning of new behaviors and their spread throughout the population (e.g., Krützen et al., 2005; Wild et al., 2020). For example, Patterson and Mann (2011) found that the use of sponges by some bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia, protected their rostra while accessing fish without swim bladders, found below rubble-laden substrates. This allowed for the improved exploitation of the resources available within their environment. In the case of the dolphins in Jamaica, we propose that the presentation of food-related stimuli, in this case prey fish, reinforced the development of this new foraging tactic. The goal-oriented manipulation exhibited by the observed dolphins indicates that they had previous experience interacting with traps and that this behavior had been learned before. The cases where dolphins re-balanced or re-rotated upright traps suggest that dolphins have a cognitive representation of how the trap should be oriented to facilitate extraction of the fish and that manipulation does not simply follow from a series of blindly executed memorized actions. Bottlenose dolphins are capable of social learning and cultural transmission of behavior, including foraging tactics (e.g., Whitehead & Rendell, 2014; Wild et al., 2020). The observation of a group of three dolphins interacting with a trap (e.g., Video S3) provides the context for social learning (Galef & Giraldeau, 2001; Galef & Laland, 2005) and social facilitation (Clayton, 1978). This suggests that the depredation behavior can be socially transmitted among individuals, has the potential to expand through the population, with patterns determined by social structure at faster rates than from individually learned behaviors (Clayton, 1978), and has a greater chance of persisting in the population (Boyd & Richerson, 1985; Whitehead et al., 2004), if environmental conditions allow for it. Individual learning opportunities also exist as dolphins explore traps in their environment, such as when dolphins encounter upright traps previously manipulated by other individuals. While the development of specialized foraging tactics may be influenced by habitat type (e.g., Patterson & Mann, 2011; Torres & Read, 2009) and the changes observed within those environments (e.g., Donaldson et al., 2012; Noke & Odell, 2002), the transmission of those tactics may occur through observation, either by vertical (mother to calf) (e.g., Krützen et al., 2005), horizontal (through conspecifics of the same generation) (e.g., Donaldson et al., 2012), or oblique transmission (through conspecifics of the different generations) (e.g., Mann et al., 2007). The sex of adult bottlenose dolphins may also determine the type of transmission seen (Mann & Sargeant, 2003). While calves of both sexes may practice foraging behaviors demonstrated by their mothers, male calves are weaned earlier than female calves (Mann & Sargeant, 2003). This may make female bottlenose dolphins more likely to employ their mothers' foraging tactics since they are more exposed to them. Conversely, mother–son associations may decline after weaning and male bottlenose dolphins may instead use foraging tactics transmitted through associations with other male conspecifics that allow them to access opportunistic or easily accessible food sources (Mann & Sargeant, 2003). The identification of single, male, bottlenose dolphins feeding from the traps in this study is consistent with this since male dolphins are more likely to travel by themselves, making it difficult to engage in cooperative foraging strategies (Adimey et al., 2014; Morales-Rincon et al., 2019; Powell & Wells, 2011). However, Burge et al. (2023) documented one instance of what may have been a mother and calf interacting with a trap, with the adult attempting to unsuccessfully turn the trap upright, with no depredation taking place. It may therefore be possible that female dolphins are also involved in depredation and that the behavior is passed on through both horizontal and vertical transmissions (Mann & Sargeant, 2003; Wild et al., 2020). Since the sex of all the animals engaged in depredation in our study could not be identified, further work to assess the sexes of the animals engaged in this behavior may help determine how this behavior is transmitted throughout the population. Observations of dolphins inspecting traps containing fish without engaging in depredation, ignoring larger fish outside of fish traps, and of dolphins abandoning traps with fish inside, suggest that they may be selecting specific fish species (Brotons et al., 2008), selecting specific fish sizes, and that traps may provide an opportunity to access preferred prey species (Rechimont et al., 2018). Overfishing in Jamaican waters has resulted in changes to species composition and fish size. Higher valued commercial species such as snappers (Lutjanidae) and groupers (Serranidae) have been replaced with lower valued commercial species such as surgeonfish (Acanthuridae), parrotfish (Scaridae), and squirrelfish (Holocentridae) (e.g., Aiken & Haughton, 1987; Miller et al., 1996), while the added selective pressure for larger individuals has resulted in decreases in the overall size of the fish on the reef leaving only smaller fish to reproduce (Klomp et al., 2003). With overfishing causing fishers to catch smaller, lower trophic level fish species, this may be placing them in direct competition with bottlenose dolphins since both the fishers and the dolphins may be targeting the same, smaller individuals, within those species. In Jamaican waters, the average total lengths of Acanthuridae and Scaridae species were 100 and 120 mm (Klomp et al., 2003), respectively, and dolphins have been seen targeting A. tractus caught in Z-shaped traps (Burge et al., 2023). The sizes of these fish are consistent with the range of prey sizes (69–640 mm) identified for bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota Bay (Barros & Wells, 1998). This may explain why some of the videos showed larger fish being ignored by the dolphins as they swam past traps. Mignucci-Giannoni et al. (2009) attributed the death of a bottlenose dolphin to asphyxiation from choking on a 492-mm-long black margate (Anisotremus surinamensis), while smaller individuals of the same species were found in its stomach. Since the diet of bottlenose dolphins in Jamaican waters is unknown, these species may be consumed by dolphins but only at smaller sizes, since the larger sizes may be difficult to swallow. The dolphins may also be attracted by the sounds made by targeted fish species. Both A. tractus and H. aurolineatum, which were identified as prey items by Burge et al. (2023), are from families whose recorded species produce sound either through swim bladders, or both pharyngeal teeth and swim bladders, respectively (Fish & Mowbray, 1970). The sounds produced by these mechanisms may help attract the dolphins to the trap through passive listening (Barros & Wells, 1998). Berens McCabe et al. (2010), for example, found that soniferous fish species were disproportionately selected as prey by bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota Bay, Florida, over non-soniferous species, with passive listening for soniferous prey potentially providing an ecological or energetic advantage for the dolphins. Alternatively, acoustic cues provided by both species may also be used by echolocating dolphins to help identify specific prey species (Au et al., 2009). Audio and video recordings documenting the species found in the traps, particularly those being consumed by the dolphins, may help to determine if particular species are being targeted. Even though trap fishing has occurred in Jamaica since the 19th century, and Z-shaped traps were introduced in the 1920s (Hardt, 2009), reports of depredation only began in the early 2000s (Aiken & Pal, 2008). A reduction of preferred prey species caused by the continued overexploitation of Jamaica's marine environment may have enhanced the development of new foraging strategies to access these resources (Powell & Wells, 2011). Depredation may also be occurring because the presence of traps within the habitat has provided dolphins with an opportunity to develop a more efficient foraging tactic allowing them to opportunistically take advantage of trapped prey (e.g., Chávez-Martínez et al., 2022; Díaz López, 2006; Noke & Odell, 2002; Zollett & Read, 2006). While it was difficult to determine the number of individuals engaged in this behavior due to a combination of factors such as water visibility, the quality of the video, the distance of the camera from the depredation event, and the orientation of their bodies with respect to the camera, it is important that further studies try to determine the number of individuals involved, and how widespread the behavior is. Even though it is not currently possible to ascertain what proportion of the population extracts fish from fishing gear, reports of depredation are island-wide (Aiken & Pal, 2008; Burge et al., 2023; O'Sullivan, personal observation). Additional studies will help determine whether the behavior is found throughout the population, or can only be attributed to a few individuals (Mann, 1999). The collection of acoustic recordings and the identification of signature whistles (Janik et al., 2013), in conjunction with the video recordings, for example, may help to determine the number of individuals engaged in depredation at the sites. Once the behavior, and its spread through the population, is better understood, it may be possible to develop mitigation measures that will help minimize the catch lost, and the economic consequences ascribed by the fishers. One possible mitigation measure that could be tested is the addition of underwater buoys to the traps. In one documented instance (Figure 6), a trap with a buoy attached was only turned on its side. Even though the dolphin was still able to extract fish from the trap, the trap began to fall back down in at least two instances, which would allow the trap to continue catching fish. Since the fishers often complain that the traps, when left upright, are unable to catch fish, the use of these buoys may help to reduce the losses they sustain. However, Burge et al. (2023) documented two bottlenose dolphins turning a trap with a rope and possible buoy attached to it. Additional research will have to be done to determine whether differences in the length of the rope or the size/position of the float used may make this method an effective mitigation measure. The use of continuous video recordings has often been used in the terrestrial environment to document the behaviors of several different species, including snakes (Clark et al., 2012), birds (Cunningham & Castro, 2011; Rutz et al., 2007), and primates (Walton et al., 2024) in their natural environments, without influencing or impeding the behaviors being expressed. However, the application of this method to document marine species in the wild has been more limited (e.g., Boom et al., 2012). The use of continuous video recordings, similar to the methods used here, may help to reduce the impacts of weather constraints on direct field observations, allow for the simultaneous monitoring of different individuals in the field, and facilitate the repeated viewing of the captured behaviors (Karnowski et al., 2016; Scheibe et al., 2008). The continued use of video monitoring in Jamaica may help provide insight into the extent to which bottlenose dolphins engage in fish trap depredation. Extended monitoring can reveal whether there is seasonality in depredation activity, if it is concentrated at particular locations, the number of individual dolphins involved, and assist in quantifying the costs to fishers. Photo-identification techniques, and the deployment of multiple cameras closer to the fish traps, may allow for the identification of the individual animals engaged in depredation events and provide insight into the patterns of spread in the population. Identifying which, if any, fish species are preferred, including their energy content and the energetic costs of depredation, may elucidate the advantages gained by fish trap depredation, while a better understanding of how the fish are extracted from the traps can lead to the development of mitigation measures that will minimize the cost to fishers. In conclusion, our observations of this bottlenose dolphin foraging behavior targeting Antillean Z-shaped fish traps support the premise that the dolphins' cognitive abilities have allowed them to exploit resources targeted by Jamaica's fishing industry. The development of this foraging tactic may also enhance their ability to exploit preferred prey species and increase foraging efficiency. While the development of a more efficient foraging tactic, and the ability to exploit an otherwise unavailable resource, or at a lower energetic cost, may prove advantageous for the dolphins (Chávez-Martínez et al., 2022), increased interactions with human activities may have detrimental effects on their population. Fishers in Jamaica routinely complain about the impacts these interactions have had on their livelihoods, with some threatening retaliation (Aiken & Pal, 2008; C. O'Sullivan, personal observation). Given the bottlenose dolphin's protected status under Jamaican law, and that their distribution and population size are unknown (Kenney et al., 2004), efforts need to be taken to better understand the impacts of this foraging tactic and reduce any perceived threats.

https://doi.org/10.3390/f10080609,Interactions between Climate and Nutrient Cycles on Forest Response to Global Change: The Role of Mixed Forests,"Forest ecosystems are undergoing unprecedented changes in environmental conditions due to global change impacts. Modification of global biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen, and the subsequent climate change are affecting forest functions at different scales, from physiology and growth of individual trees to cycling of nutrients. This review summarizes the present knowledge regarding the impact of global change on forest functioning not only with respect to climate change, which is the focus of most studies, but also the influence of altered nitrogen cycle and the interactions among them. The carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization effect on tree growth is expected to be constrained by nutrient imbalances resulting from high N deposition rates and the counteractive effect of increasing water deficit, which interact in a complex way. At the community level, responses to global change are modified by species interactions that may lead to competition for resources and/or relaxation due to facilitation and resource partitioning processes. Thus, some species mixtures can be more resistant to drought than their respective pure forests, albeit it depends on environmental conditions and species’ functional traits. Climate change and nitrogen deposition have additional impacts on litterfall dynamics, and subsequent decomposition and nutrient mineralization processes. Elemental ratios (i.e., stoichiometry) are associated with important ecosystem traits, including trees’ adaptability to stress or decomposition rates. As stoichiometry of different ecosystem components are also influenced by global change, nutrient cycling in forests will be altered too. Therefore, a re-assessment of traditional forest management is needed in order to cope with global change. Proposed silvicultural systems emphasize the key role of diversity to assure multiple ecosystem services, and special attention has been paid to mixed-species forests. Finally, a summary of the patterns and underlying mechanisms governing the relationships between diversity and different ecosystems functions, such as productivity and stability, is provided.",https://openalex.org/W2964016571,2d645df681aa29c9ba71ec7e78f0525bbf720555,0,True,0.976518452167511,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.13746,Competitive interactions affect introgression and population viability amidst maladaptive hybridization,"The deliberate release of captive-bred individuals, the accidental escape of domesticated strains, or the invasion of closely related conspecifics into wild populations can all lead to introgressive hybridization, which poses a challenge for conservation and wildlife management. Rates of introgression and the magnitude of associated demographic impacts vary widely across ecological contexts. However, the reasons for this variation remain poorly understood. One rarely considered phenomenon in this context is soft selection, wherein relative trait values determine success in intraspecific competition for a limiting resource. Here we develop an eco-genetic model explicitly focussed on understanding the influence of such competitive interactions on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of wild populations experiencing an influx of foreign/domesticated individuals. The model is applicable to any taxon that experiences natural or human-mediated inputs of locally maladapted genotypes ('intrusion'), in addition to phenotype-dependent competition for a limiting resource (e.g. breeding sites, feeding territories). The effects of both acute and chronic intrusion depended strongly on the relative competitiveness of intruders versus locals. When intruders were competitively inferior, density-dependent regulation limited their reproductive success (ability to compete for limited spawning sites), which prevented strong introgression or population declines from occurring. In contrast, when intruders were competitively superior, this amplified introgression and led to increased maladaptation of the admixed population. This had negative consequences for population size and population viability. The results were sensitive to the intrusion level, the magnitude of reproductive excess, trait heritability and the extent to which intruders were maladapted relative to locals. Our findings draw attention to under-appreciated interactions between phenotype-dependent competitive interactions and maladaptive hybridization, which may be critical to determining the impact captive breeding programmes and domesticated escapees can have on otherwise self-sustaining wild populations.",https://openalex.org/W4400258445,26d2ebe06be830fb622c83a09b21bef76271feae,0,True,0.988706111907959,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/rec.14354,The role of habitat in predator–prey dynamics with applications to restoration,"Habitat is a powerful force in ecosystems, and the quantity and quality of habitat can shape ecosystem structure and function. Among the many important roles that habitat plays is as a mediator of ecological interactions, including predator–prey dynamics. In the context of ecosystem restoration, there is great potential to better understand how predator–prey dynamics are influenced by habitat and whether this has implications for how ecosystems are managed. We consider the ways in which habitat serves as an important mediator of interactions between predators and their prey and present four ways in which habitat acts as an intermediary that enhances or diminishes this relationship. We found that habitat provides refuge from predators and shapes the physical traits of prey as they use their surroundings to protect themselves. We also discuss how habitat creates physical resistance and sets the cost of predation for predators and how habitat facilitates apparent competition within a community context. These roles of habitat are well established in ecology, but we believe they are underdeveloped from an applied perspective. We conclude that habitat must be appropriately considered in the context of how it mediates predation. Given the ways that habitat influences predation, restoration efforts should consider if and how physical measures may positively or negatively affect species interactions and whether this could lead to success or failure of overall programs.",https://openalex.org/W4406755848,a24cbe048fd85dc274ed701906e7687fdce86e28,0,True,0.989788293838501,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.70039,Coexistence of coinvading species with mutualism and competition,"Abstract All interactions between multiple species invading together (coinvasion) must be accounted for to predict species coexistence patterns across space. Mutualisms, particularly, are known to influence species' population dynamics and their invasive ability (e.g., mycorrhizal fungi with partner plants). Yet, while modeling coinvasion, their role in mediating coexistence is overlooked. Here, we build a spatially explicit model of coinvasion of two competing plant species with a shared fungal mutualist to study how mutualism and competition interact to shape the local and regional coexistence of competitors. We observe four main results. First, mutualist presence generates regional coexistence between competitors even when local coexistence between them is impossible. Second, increasing partner mutualist dispersal leads to abrupt changes in competitor coexistence outcomes. Third, differences in mutualist partner dependence and competitive ability interact to produce a variety of local and regional coexistence outcomes. Fourth, asymmetry in the dispersal ability arising from dependence‐dispersal trade‐offs leads to greater exclusion of species less dependent on mutualist partners for growth. In toto, incorporating mutualism‐specific trait trade‐offs and dispersal asymmetries into coinvasion models offers new insights into regional coexistence and invasive species distributions.",https://openalex.org/W4407908292,f14b0dd3d54eded3b876083986fa574080bdb6e9,0,True,0.9372382760047913,0
https://doi.org/10.26686/wgtn.17019293,"Going all the way: The implications of life history and phenotype on reproductive success of the common triplefin, Forsterygion lapillum","Identifying sources of variation in individual reproductive success is crucial to our understanding of population dynamics and evolutionary ecology. In many systems, the determinants of success are not well known. Where species have parental care, for example, determinants of success can be particularly challenging to partition between parents and offspring. In this thesis I investigate drivers and consequences of variable life histories, for a small reef fish that exhibits male parental care (the common triplefin Forsterygion lapillum). I examined the influence of individual life history, phenotype and behaviour on (1) the performance of recently settled juveniles, and (2) the reproductive success adult males.  I made field-based observations of adult males during the breeding season, measured their phenotypic traits (body size and condition) and used their otoliths to reconstruct life history characteristics (hatch dates and mean growth rates). My life history trait reconstructions suggested two alternate pathways to ’success’ for adult males. Successful males hatched earlier and therefore had a developmental ’head start’ over less successful males (i.e., males with eggs > male territory holders without eggs > floaters). Alternatively, males can apparently achieve success by growing faster: for males born in the same month, those with eggs grew faster than those with territories and no eggs, and both groups grew faster than floaters. These results suggest that accelerated growth rate may mediate the effects of a later hatch date, and that both hatch dates and growth rates influence the success of adult males, likely through proximate effects on individual phenotypes.  Identifying sources of variation in individual reproductive success is crucial to our understanding of population dynamics and evolutionary ecology. In many systems, the determinants of success are not well known. Where species have parental care, for example, determinants of success can be particularly challenging to partition between parents and offspring. Male parental care is common among fishes, where resources such as high quality territories and mates often may be limiting. In such systems, individual success of offspring may result from distinct life history pathways that are influenced by both parental effects (e.g., timing of reproduction) and by the offspring themselves (e.g., ’personalities’). These pathways, in turn, can induce phenotypic variation and affect success later in life. The drivers and consequences of variable life histories are not well understood in the context of reproductive success.  In this thesis I investigate drivers and consequences of variable life histories, for a small reef fish that exhibits male parental care (the common triplefin Forsterygion lapillum). I examined the influence of individual life history, phenotype and behaviour on (1) the performance of recently settled juveniles, and (2) the reproductive success adult males. I made field-based observations of adult males during the breeding season, measured their phenotypic traits (body size and condition) and used their otoliths to reconstruct life history characteristics (hatch dates and mean growth rates). Some males showed no evidence of territorial defence and were defined as ’floaters’; others defended territories, and a subset of these also had nests with eggs present. Adult male body size was significantly higher for males that defended breeding territories, and body condition was significantly higher for the males that had eggs (i.e., had successfully courted females). My otolith-based reconstructions of life history traits suggested two alternate pathways to ’success’ for adult males. Successful males hatched earlier and therefore had a developmental ’head start’ over less successful males (i.e., males with eggs > male territory holders without eggs > floaters). Alternatively, males can apparently achieve success by growing faster: for males born in the same month, those with eggs grew faster than those with territories and no eggs, and both groups grew faster than floaters. These results suggest that accelerated growth rate may mediate the effects of a later hatch date, and that both hatch dates and growth rates influence the success of adult males, likely through proximate effects on individual phenotypes.  I evaluated the effects of variable life history in a complimentary lab-based study. Specifically, I manipulated the developmental environments (feeding regime and temperature) for young fish and evaluated the direct effects on life history traits and phenotypes. Then, I conducted an assay to quantify the indirect effects of developmental environment, life history traits, and phenotypes on aggression and performance of young fish. These developmental environments did not have a clear, overall effect on juvenile phenotype or performance (i.e. behavioural aggression and the ability to dominate a resource). Instead, individuals (irrespective of developmental environment) that grew faster and/or longer pelagic larval durations had increased odds of dominating a limited resource. I attributed the non-significant direct effect of developmental environment to within-treatment mortality and variation among individuals in terms of their realised access to food (i.e., dominance hierarchies were apparent in rearing chambers, suggesting a non-uniform access to food). Fish that were more likely to dominate a resource were also more aggressive (i.e., more likely to engage in chasing behaviours). Fish that were larger and more aggressive established territories that were deemed to be of higher ’quality’ (inferred from percent cover of cobble resources). Overall, this study suggests a complex interplay between social systems, phenotype and life history. Developmental environments may influence phenotypes, although behavioural differences among individuals may moderate that effect, contributing to additional variation in phenotypes and life history traits which, in turn, shape the success of individuals.  Collectively, my thesis emphasises the consequences of life history variability on success at multiple life stages. These results may be relevant to other species that exhibit male parental care or undergo intense competition for space during early life stages. In addition, my results highlight interactions between life history, phenotype and behaviour that can have important implications for population dynamics and evolutionary ecology.",6ec3f26bb3247930d256d72987b7e084eac7d40b,6ec3f26bb3247930d256d72987b7e084eac7d40b,0,True,0.9547145366668701,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1218,Herbivore density mediates the indirect effect of herbivores on plants via induced resistance and apparent competition,"Abstract Herbivore‐induced plant resistance and apparent competition are two indirect ways herbivores interact. If a less damaging herbivore indirectly suppresses the abundance of a more damaging herbivore via these mechanisms, then plants may ultimately benefit. Changes in herbivore density, however, can dictate the intensity of species interactions and may play a critical role in determining the outcome of plant‐ and predator‐mediated herbivore interactions. We tested the effects of herbivore density on the strength of indirect interactions among phloem‐feeding aphids and herbivorous caterpillars and the outcome of these interactions for their shared host plant, cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum ). We quantified the survival of caterpillars on host plants that were infested with varying densities of aphids in the presence and absence of predators (ladybeetles). We found that aphids induced defensive proteins in cotton plants and that caterpillar survival was negatively affected by induced resistance. Likewise, we found that the presence of aphids increased predation of caterpillars by ladybeetles, but that apparent competition between aphids and caterpillars was density dependent. Ladybeetles consumed relatively high numbers of small caterpillars at low to intermediate aphid densities, but essentially became aphid specialists at high aphid densities. Aphid induced defenses and apparent competition combined such that plant damage by caterpillars was lowest when predators were present at low aphid density (induced resistance + highest level of apparent competition). This suggests that herbivores can benefit plants, but the effect on host plants is mediated by herbivore density. Indirect herbivore‐plant mutualisms may increase plant quality, plant fitness, and yield of crop plants and these interactions need to be considered in ecologically based pest management plans. In addition, these interactions likely alter arthropod community structure and natural selection on anti‐herbivore defense traits in plants in natural systems.",https://openalex.org/W2291488578,fc5312776738c6a1c139b9e0a5aedcdb7cd8f412,0,True,0.9626578688621521,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12403,The sign of cascading predator effects varies with prey traits in a detrital system,"Theory and experiments show that the nature of 'green' trophic cascades, between predators, herbivores and plants, varies with several key species traits: predator hunting mode and predator and prey habitat domains. Meanwhile, 'brown' cascades between predators, environment-modifying detritivores and plants have been largely overlooked and the roles of species traits, particularly prey traits, in determining the nature of these cascades remains unclear. We hypothesize that, in predator-detritivore-plant interaction chains, the burrowing ability of plant-facilitating detritivores determines their response to predators and thus the sign of indirect effect transmitted. In the dung-decomposer food web of an alpine meadow, we predicted that in the presence of above-ground predacious beetles: (i) non-burrowing detritivores will suffer mortality due to predation and transmit negative indirect effects to plants, whereas (ii) burrowing detritivores will escape predation by retreating deeper into the soil, transmitting positive indirect effects to plants. In support of predictions, experiments showed that a single species of predacious beetle (i) reduced the density of the non-burrowing species and indirectly reduced dung loss rate, soil nutrient concentrations and plant biomass, but (ii) drove the burrowing species deeper, indirectly improved soil conditions and increased plant biomass. These results show that the burrowing ability of a detritivore can determine whether it transmits a negative indirect effect mediated by a reduction in its density, or a positive indirect effect mediated by its behavioural response to predation risk. We call for further tests of our detritivore-trait hypothesis in different regions and ecosystems to further develop a general trait-based framework for trophic cascades in detrital food webs. We further advance the general hypothesis that the locomotion traits of prey species (e.g. burrowing/flying ability) may help explain their behavioural response to predation risk and the nature of indirect effect they transmit from predators to plants.",https://openalex.org/W1549655949,37c64db42f8d515428388ea8c8cdd61dadaabf7b,0,True,0.9955645203590393,0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12862-022-01991-1,Symbiont-conferred immunity interacts with effects of parasitoid genotype and intraguild predation to affect aphid immunity in a clone-specific fashion,"Host-parasite interactions represent complex co-evolving systems in which genetic and associated phenotypic variation within a species can significantly affect selective pressures on traits, such as host immunity, in the other. While often modelled as a two-species interaction between host and parasite, some systems are more complex due to effects of host enemies, intraguild predation, and endosymbionts, all of which affect host immunity. However, it remains unclear how these factors, combined with genetic variation in the host and the parasitoid, affect host immunity. We address this question in an important agricultural pest system, the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, which shows significant intraspecific variability in immunity to the parasitoid wasp Aphidius ervi. In a complex experiment, we use a quantitative genetic design in the parasitoid, two ecologically different aphid lineages and the aphid lion Chrysoperla carnea as an intraguild predator to unravel the complex interdependencies. We demonstrate that aphid immunity as a key trait of this complex host-parasite system is affected by intraspecific genetic variation in the parasitoid and the aphid, the interaction of intraspecific genetic variation with intraguild predation, and differences in defensive endosymbionts between aphid lineages. Further, aphid lineages differ in their altruistic behaviour whereby infested aphids move away from the clonal colony to facilitate predation. Our findings provide new insights into the influence of endosymbiosis and genetic variability in an important host-parasitoid system which is influenced by natural enemies of the parasitoid and the aphid, including its endosymbiont communities. We show that endosymbiosis can mediate or influence the evolutionary arms race between aphids and their natural enemies. The outcome of these complex interactions between species has significant implications for understanding the evolution of multitrophic systems, including eco-agricultural settings.",https://openalex.org/W4220678686,03f25d27e2f082c2de8c4ba76c566c462059ab50,0,True,0.9198583960533142,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jeb.13684,Direct and indirect selection on mate choice during pollen competition: Effects of male and female sexual traits on offspring performance following two‐donor crosses,"Mate choice in plants is poorly understood, in particular its indirect genetic benefits, but also the direct benefits of avoiding harmful matings. In the herb Collinsia heterophylla, delayed stigma receptivity has been suggested to enhance pollen competition, potentially functioning as a female mate choice trait. Previous studies show that this trait can mitigate the cost of early fertilization caused by pollen, thus providing a direct benefit. We performed two-donor pollinations during successive floral stages to assess how this stigma receptivity trait and two pollen traits known to affect siring success influence indirect benefits in terms of offspring performance. We also investigated differential resource allocation by studying the influence of sibling performance in the same capsule. Offspring performance in terms of flower number was mainly affected by parental identities and differential resource allocation. Offspring seed production showed some influence of resource allocation, but was also affected by pollen donor identity and varied positively with late stigma receptivity. However, the effect of late stigma receptivity on offspring seed production was weakened in matings with pollen that advanced stigma receptivity. In conclusion, delayed stigma receptivity may be selected through both direct and indirect fitness effects in C. heterophylla, where pollen-based delay on stigma receptivity might act as a cue for mate choice. However, selection may also be counteracted by antagonistic selection on pollen to advance stigma receptivity. Our results highlight the challenges of studying indirect genetic benefits and other factors that influence mate choice in plants.",https://openalex.org/W3046049304,fe6009bb0e888334387fe0554bebc1d3858a5a60,0,True,0.9178414344787598,0
https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.1999.00359.x,Systemic acquired resistance: available information and open ecological questions,"1 How widespread is SAR within the plant kingdom? 2 Does SAR fit into the framework provided by established theories on plant (anti-herbivore) defence? 3 What are the allocation costs and ultimately the fitness costs of SAR? 4 Why is SAR an inducible and not a constitutive defence? 5 What is the advantage of a defence induced systemically by a single pathogen, which then gives resistance against many others that are not yet causing any problems and which probably may never challenge the regarded plant? 6 Are there any functional or physiological relations between SAR and other biological interactions, for example mutualisms between plants and micro-organisms? 7 Do plants exist in nature that are older than seedlings that have not already been induced? The many excellent reviews on the molecular aspects of SAR include those by Ryals et al. (1994), Hunt & Ryals (1996), Hunt et al. (1996), Ryals et al. (1996) and Schneider et al. (1996), and only a short overview is given here, before considering the ecological possibilities. Indeed, simply applying established ecological theories and models to the phenomenon (for example, examining SAR within the concept of fitness costs) may shed new light on this important type of plant defence. Infection by bacteria, viruses or fungi, induces many plant species to synthesize a signal at the site of infection, which then spreads systemically throughout the plant. This leads to the expression of a broad-spectrum, long-lasting immunity in both infected and non-infected plant parts. Initially, this phenomenon was thought to be ubiquitous, and resistance was thought to be equally effective against many different pathogens (Ryals et al. 1994; Jackson & Taylor 1996 and literature cited therein), but more recent studies suggest intra-and interspecific variability (see later). The systemic reaction involves the production of chitinases, β-(1,3)-glucanases, lysozyme, permatins, and at least two more classes of so-called pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins (Ryals et al. 1996; Schneider et al. 1996) which may protect against further infections. Chitinases are particularly effective against several pathogenic fungi (Boller et al. 1983; Schlumbaum et al. 1986; Sahai & Manocha 1993), and the efficacy of SAR against a variety of bacteria, viruses and fungi has also been demonstrated convincingly (Boller et al. 1983; Hoffland et al. 1996; Anfoka & Buchenauer 1997; further literature cited in Schneider et al. 1996). A main characteristic of SAR is that the induced defence does not depend directly on the type of inducing pathogen. For example, pretreatment with bacteria (Pseudomonas fluorescens strain WCS417) protected radish (Raphanus sativus, Brassicaceae) against a fungal root pathogen as well as a bacterial and two different fungal leaf pathogens (Hoffland et al. 1996), and inoculation of tomato plants with tobacco necrosis virus elicited resistance against the fungus Phytophthora infestans (Oomyceta) (Anfoka & Buchenauer 1997). The PR proteins produced in response to pathogens can also be induced by the plant hormone ethylene (Linthorst et al. 1996), or by stress, including mechanical wounding (Ignatius et al. 1994). SAR can also be induced experimentally by the application of certain chemicals, most notably salicylic acid (SA) and benzothiadiazole (Friedrich et al. 1996; Görlach et al. 1996; Lawton et al. 1996). Although the induction of chitinases and β-(1,3)-glucanases by the stress hormone ethylene has been shown in several plant species (Boller et al. 1983; Vierheilig et al. 1994 and literature cited therein), the pathway leading from a first and locally restricted infection to the systemic response is not yet well understood. SA seems to be involved in this transduction (Malamy et al. 1990; Métraux et al. 1990; Delaney et al. 1994; Hunt et al. 1996; Thulke & Conrath 1998) but it may not be the primary transported signal (Rasmussen et al. 1991; Vernooij et al. 1994; Willits & Ryals 1998), although SA can indeed be synthesized in one leaf and translocated to the next (Shualev et al. 1995; Mölders et al. 1996). It has also been shown to inhibit catalase activity, and elevated levels of H2O2 could thus function as the second messenger (Chen et al. 1993). However, the absence of any increase of H2O2 in uninfected leaves at the onset of SAR gene activation, and the phytotoxic levels needed for SAR induction (Hunt et al. 1996; discussed in Schneider et al. 1996), together with the high reactivity of H2O2, make it rather improbable that this component is translocated over large distances. Although parts of the signalling pathway seem to be highly conserved in evolution, and thus occur in all plant species so far investigated (e.g. in Arabidopsis as well as in tobacco), the type, amount and time–course of the response depends on the precise identity of both partners (Schneider & Ullrich 1994; Schneider et al. 1996; Botha et al. 1998). Thus SAR gene expression was first detected in tobacco about 6 days after inoculation (Ryals et al. 1994), but as early as 7 hours after a primary infection in cucumber (Schneider et al. 1996): in both species, patterns in the activity of the various hydrolytic enzymes depended on the inducer (Schneider & Ullrich 1994). Variation occurs in particular with respect to the efficacy of defence. For example, Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes vary in their resistance to cauliflower mosaic virus (Callaway et al. 1996), and nim 1 mutants (non-inducible immunity) differ in PR-1 production, while eds (enhanced disease susceptibility) mutants have distinguishable phenotypes with respect to the susceptibility to pathogenic bacteria. Some lines of barley differ in their ability to produce chitinases and glucanases (Ignatius et al. 1994; Hunt & Ryals 1996; Hunt et al. 1997; Rogers & Ausubel 1997; Ryals et al. 1997; Shah et al. 1997). The various chitinases that occur within the same species may differ in location, activity, chitin-binding property and catalytic mechanism, and thus allow the plant to match many different requirements (Sahai & Manocha 1993; Iseli et al. 1996). β-(1,3)-glucanase, ribosome-inactivating proteins and permatins may also occur in the form of several isozymes (Darnetty et al. 1993). Genes for some proteins belonging to the PR-1 subfamily may be expressed continuously, at least in shoot meristems and trichomes (Tornero et al. 1997). As shoot meristems are especially valuable and vulnerable, whereas trichomes in most plants are involved in defence mechanisms, this finding may be interpreted as a hint on relevant costs of SAR (see below). Of 45 research articles or meeting abstracts on SAR published during 1996 and 1997, 24 were conducted using Arabidopsis or tobacco as the model organism, another 13 referred to cucumber, potato or tomato, and only eight presented data derived from other species; the 25 earlier papers listed by Schneider et al. (1996) describe a total of 17 plant species. A similarly restricted picture is apparent from the literature on chitinase (overviewed by Sahai & Manocha 1993). The vast majority of these species are short-lived and fast-growing annuals, but known SAR markers, direct measurements of enzyme activities, or bioassays could be used to investigate the frequency of SAR in a wide range of species. So far, predominantly chitinase activity has been demonstrated for plants with other life histories, e.g. Urtica dioca (a chitinase of stinging nettle was characterized genetically by Lerner & Raikhel 1992), the rubber-tree Hevea brasiliensis (van Parijs et al. 1991) or poplar Populus sp. (Clarke et al. 1998). Information is needed on the time taken to establish SAR as well as the production and persistence of SAR-related mRNA and proteins after a single challenging infection. Data from a few annual species are insufficient to evaluate the adaptivity and ecological importance of SAR, or to determine whether plants with different life histories (e.g. annuals compared to long-lived trees) differ in their response. SAR is studied mainly in the context of plant–pathogen interactions, but may also be relevant to mutualistic interactions. Recent papers reported an induction of SAR by non-pathogenic root-colonizing bacteria (Pieterse et al. 1996; Raupach et al. 1996; van Wees et al. 1997), although the establishment of vesicular-arbuscular (VA)-mycorrhizas seems not to induce systemic reactions in host-plants (Vierheilig et al. 1994; Lange et al. 1996). SAR in cucumber and Arabidopsis has also been reported to be induced by compost and compost water extracts, an effect destroyed by autoclaving the compost mix and therefore most probably caused by soil-living micro-organisms (Zhang et al. 1998). This observation in particular leads to the question of whether any plant does exist in nature that has not already been induced by the influence of either abiotic or biotic agents. Mutual symbioses with endophytic fungi that have evolved in several grasses and trees participate in the plants' anti-herbivore defence by providing secondary metabolites, especially neurotoxic alkaloids (Clay 1990). However, little is known about the interactions between the defence mechanisms established during SAR and mutualistic endosymbionts, but it is likely that the considerable indirect cost of SAR will result from its antagonistic effects on mutualistic organisms. Can intra- and interspecific patterns in type, extent and time-course of SAR be accounted for by existing theories of chemical defence in plants, which in most cases are formulated as an anti-herbivore response? In contrast to the human immune system in which specific antibodies are produced as a reaction to each distinct antigen, SAR – once induced by a single pathogen – provides protection against a range of different pathogenic organisms. It is difficult to understand, given the evidence for continuous PR gene expression (Tornero et al. 1997), why a first – and probably severe – infection is required rather than systemic resistance being constitutive. A model proposed by Karban et al. (1997) points out that induced chemical defence may be more effective against herbivores than constitutive resistance. Small amounts of toxin may hardly reduce the herbivore's benefit from feeding on plant tissue, but increasing toxin levels may cause a progressively greater decrease in benefit at higher levels. The authors demonstrated mathematically that, in this case, variable toxin levels will lead to a lower benefit for the herbivore than the continuous presence of the corresponding mean level. Plants differ in their level of constitutive and inducible defence against pathogens (Keen 1992), and the applicability of this model to SAR could therefore be tested by quantifying the effects on the fitness of both plants and pathogens for host-plant species with different levels of inducible defence. Most theories on plant defence, however, assume that there will be a cost to fitness resulting from the production of defence chemicals or structures, which at least must be balanced by the resulting benefit. Inducible defence may thus reduce the overall costs by producing chemicals only when their function is actually required. Ecological costs should ideally be measured as reduction in fitness, i.e. fewer offspring will be produced because of the operation of the trait considered (Simms & Rausher 1987; Marquis 1991; Sagers & Coley 1995). Although, at least in long-lived species, fitness costs are hard to quantify directly (Chapin 1989), several studies have demonstrated that fitness costs may be estimated by measuring reduction in growth rates (Coley 1986; Sagers & Coley 1995; Steinberg 1995 for empirical studies; Skogsmyr & Fagerström 1992 for a theoretical model). Because resources invested in one distinct trait are no longer available for other functions such as reproduction, fitness costs may be estimated in terms of allocation costs, for example by calculating energy and construction costs (Penning de Vries et al. 1974; Gulmon & Mooney 1986; Skogsmyr & Fagerström 1992; Gershenzon 1994; Griffin 1994; Simms & Triplett 1994) or simply by quantifying the allocation of limited resources such as nitrogen (Evans & Black 1993). To my knowledge, only three studies have so far been published that attempt to quantify the costs of resistance against pathogens, and their results do not allow any generalization about the possible costs of SAR. Simms & Triplett (1994) were not able to detect fitness costs of resistance of Ipomoea spp. to anthracnose, nor could Simms & Vision (1995) prove direct allocation costs of localized resistance of young Ipomoea plants. In an attempt to use reduction in germination success to quantify the costs of anti-fungal resistance to different Avena fatua lines, Burdon & Müller (1987) obtained contradictory results from their greenhouse and field studies. However, SAR can be induced chemically in wheat by application of BION® (benzo (1,2,3) thiadiazole-7-thio-carbonic acid S-methyl ester; NOVARTIS, Basel, Switzerland) (Friedrich et al. 1996; Görlach et al. 1996; Lawton et al. 1996), and preliminary results from field studies (M. Heil, personal observations) show that treatment of plants with BION reduced the number of seeds produced. Data from several Macaranga species, which have evolved obligate or facultative mutualisms with ants to protect them continuously and very effectively against herbivory and secondary infections (Fiala et al. 1989, 1994), offer similar hints as to the costs of SAR. Chitinase activities were lower in three Macaranga species than in species from other genera that show no mutualistic interactions with ants. Macaranga plants thus seem to have a remarkably low ability to produce at least one class of PR proteins, and no costs are incurred by the production of compounds that are not required in these plants due to the effective anti-herbivore and anti-fungal defence provided by the ants (Heil et al. 1999). The 'optimal defence' hypothesis (Rhoades 1979) assumes that defence is most important and thus should be most intensive in those parts that are most valuable to the plant, such as young leaves and shoot meristems. In contrast, the 'growth-differentiation balance' hypothesis (Herms & Mattson 1992) assumes a metabolic competition between processes involved in plant growth and 'differentiation' processes necessary for, for example, the synthesis of defence chemicals. This competition should reduce the resources available to defend still growing tissues, and young leaves and shoot meristems should therefore be the least defended parts of a plant. The production of SAR-related proteins instead of proteins that are relevant for growth, the diversion of products of the shikimic acid pathway (Schneider & Ullrich 1994) to synthesize anti-bacterial phenolic compounds rather than aromatic amino acids, and enhanced lignification as reported by Hammerschmidt & Kuc (1982) and Barber et al. (1989), suggest that SAR may incur costs in terms of competition for limited resources. The clear set of physiological data given by Herbers et al. (1996) allows the two theories to be evaluated. The induction of PR protein transcripts in tobacco leaf discs floated on solutions of different sugars depended strongly on leaf developmental stage. Older leaves were highly inducible, while the same concentration of sugars failed to elicit a clear response in leaves that were not yet fully unfolded. It is difficult to use source–sink relationships to explain why only those leaves that produce high amounts of sugars by photosynthesis should be able to use these sugars as signal molecules, but according to the hypothesis of Herms & Mattson (1992) young, still growing, leaves may just be unable to produce PR proteins simply because their whole metabolic apparatus is needed for the biosynthesis of growth-relevant proteins. At least for this example, the 'optimal defence' hypothesis, which would predict high defence levels especially in the young leaves, can be discounted. Further studies using different inductors and comparing their efficacy in dependence on leaf age and developmental stage are needed, however. Unlike SAR, studies on chemical anti-herbivore defence have so far mainly focused on ecological problems and cost–benefit models rather than signalling pathways and resulting gene activities (Hammerschmidt 1993). However, the signalling pathway of SAR, and the octadecanoid pathway (Doares et al. 1995) which is involved in induced resistance against herbivores, may interact. Jasmonic acid, a central signal of the octadecanoid pathway, is produced within a few minutes after insect feeding (Blechert et al. 1995) and leads to an activation of several defence genes (Doares et al. 1995). The application of jasmonic acid also induces the production of PR proteins and therefore resistance against phytopathogens (Cohen et al. 1993; Schweizer et al. 1993). Although salicylic acid can lead to enhanced resistance of cotton to both insects and phytopathogens (Khoshkhoo et al. 1993), Bi et al. (1997) failed to identify SA as a signal in the anti-herbivore defence of this species, and Korth & Dixon (1997) also demonstrated that pathways leading to anti-herbivore defence are not activated by abiotic damage. In this case, an ecological point of view can again provide a framework for understanding the physiological findings. In nature, herbivore attack or mechanical wounding often leads to secondary pathogen attack, and using primary wounding as a signal for the induction of SAR enables the plant to be prepared for probable secondary pathogen attacks. On the other hand, herbivores seldom use heavily infected plant parts as a food source, and induction of anti-herbivore defence by signals derived from pathogen attack would therefore probably lead to the synthesis of superfluous defence molecules. Progress in ecology essentially needs testable theories as well as pluralism and diversity in new approaches (Weiner 1995). The application of specialized theories to a broader spectrum of findings often paves the way for rapid scientific developments, and the combination of formerly separated scientific disciplines can also result in new insights. Integration of SAR into ecological field research should thus provide the possibility for successful further research. I wish to thank my supervisor, K.E. Linsenmair, University of Würzburg, for allowing the time necessary to spend on the literature search and on conducting the field studies on SAR. Many thanks also to K.E. Linsenmair, B. Fiala, W.

In response, marine reserves can be used to protect exploited species and conserve biodiversity. The increased abundance of predatory species in marine reserves may cause indirect effects along chains of multi-trophic interactions. These trophic cascades can arise through direct predation, density-mediated indirect interactions (DMIIs), or indirect behavioural effects, termed trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs). The extent of algal cover and the abundance of 4 primary consumers were determined in Lough Hyne, which was designated Europe’s first marine nature reserve in 1981. The primary consumers were the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, the topshell Gibbula cineraria, the oyster Anomia ephippium, and the scallop Chlamys varia. The abundances of 3 starfish species (Marthasterias glacialis, Asterias rubens, and Asterina gibbosa) were also determined, as were 2 potential crustacean predators, Necora puber and Carcinus maenas. These data were compared with historical data from a 1962 (prey) and a 1963 (predator) survey to determine the nature of community interactions over adjacent trophic levels. The present study reveals a breakdown in population structure of the 4 surveyed prey species. Marine reserve designation has led to an increase in predatory crabs and M. glacialis, a subsequent decrease in primary consumers, ­especially the herbivore P. lividus, and an increase in macroalgal cover which is indicative of a trophic cascade. The study shows that establishing a Marine Reserve does not guarantee that ­conservation benefits will be distributed equally.
