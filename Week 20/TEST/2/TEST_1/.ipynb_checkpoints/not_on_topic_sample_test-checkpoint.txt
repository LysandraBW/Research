TITLE: Female Choice for Males with Greater Fertilization Success in the Swedish Moor Frog, Rana arvalis
ABSTRACT: Background Studies of mate choice in anuran amphibians have shown female preference for a wide range of male traits despite females gaining no direct resources from males (i.e. non-resource based mating system). Nevertheless, theoretical and empirical studies have shown that females may still gain indirect genetic benefits from choosing males of higher genetic quality and thereby increase their reproductive success. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated two components of sexual selection in the Moor frog (Rana arvalis), pre-copulatory female choice between two males of different size ('large' vs. 'small'), and their fertilization success in sperm competition and in isolation. Females' showed no significant preference for male size (13 small and six large male preferences) but associated preferentially with the male that subsequently was the most successful at fertilizing her eggs in isolation. Siring success of males in competitive fertilizations was unrelated to genetic similarity with the female and we detected no effect of sperm viability on fertilization success. There was, however, a strong positive association between a male's innate fertilization ability with a female and his siring success in sperm competition. We also detected a strong negative effect of a male's thumb length on his competitive siring success. Conclusions/Significance Our results show that females show no preference for male size but are still able to choose males which have greater fertilization success. Genetic similarity and differences in the proportion of viable sperm within a males ejaculate do not appear to affect siring success. These results could be explained through pre- and/or postcopulatory choice for genetic benefits and suggest that females are able to perceive the genetic quality of males, possibly basing their choice on multiple phenotypic male traits.

TITLE: An Essential GTPase, Der, Containing Double GTP-binding Domains from Escherichia coli and Thermotoga maritima
ABSTRACT: A gene encoding a putative GTPase containing two tandemly repeated GTP-binding domains from a hyperthermophilic bacterium, Thermotoga maritima, was cloned and expressed inEscherichia coli. The gene (TM1446) termed deris highly conserved in Eubacteria including E. coli. The purified der product (Tm-Der) has GTPase activity but no ATPase activity. GTP, GDP, and dGTP but not GMP, ATP, CTP, and UTP compete for GTP binding to Tm-Der. An optimal condition for the GTPase assay was determined to be pH 7.5 in 400 mm KCl and 5 mm MgCl2 at 70 °C, whereKm, V max, andk cat values were determined to be 110 µm, 3.46 µm/min, and 0.87 min−1, respectively. A der deletion strain ofE. coli was constructed by replacing the dergene (originally annotated yfgK) with a kanamycin resistance gene. The deletion strain was found to form colonies only if the cells harbored a plasmid containing der, indicating that der is essential for E. coligrowth.

E. coli Ras-like protein double-Era-like domains polymerase chain reaction base pairs Luria-Bertani dithiothreitol A number of GTPase proteins are known to play crucial roles for various cellular functions such as proliferation, protein translation, signal transduction, cell growth, and protein targeting (1Bourene H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar, 2Bourene H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). To regulate these cellular functions, GTPase proteins undergo three different conformational states. The binding of GTP to a GTPase protein (active state) induces the conformational change leading to interaction with its effector molecule, and then bound GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP (inactive state). The resultant GDP is then released from the guanine nucleotide-binding site (empty state) (1Bourene H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar, 2Bourene H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). The ratio of the active GTP-bound state to the inactive GDP-bound state of a GTPase protein is crucial for regulating the cellular events mentioned above. This ratio is governed by two classes of regulatory proteins: the guanine nucleotide release proteins (GNRPs), which help the release of bound GDP promoting its replacement by GTP, and the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which enhance GTP hydrolysis. All of the GTPases or GTP-binding proteins contain the well conserved motifs, G1, G3, and G4. These motifs are critical for GDP/GTP exchange, GTP-induced conformational change, and GTP hydrolysis (2Bourene H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). The G2 motif, the effector region that is highly conserved within each GTPase family but not among different families, is involved in interaction with an effector molecule (1Bourene H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar, 2Bourene H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F.

The G2 motif is not involved in GTP binding. Escherichia coli contains a number of GTPase proteins. Among them, EF-Tu and EF-G are known to be involved in protein synthesis (4Kaziro Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 505: 95-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), and TrmE is involved in tRNA modification (5Cabedo H. Macián F. Villarroya M. Escudero J.C. Martı́nez-Vicente M. Knecht E. Armengod M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7063-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 6Yamanaka K. Hwang J. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 7078-7082Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, E. coli contains another GTP-binding protein called Era1 (E. coliRas-like protein), which has been shown to be essential for cell growth (7March P.E. Lerner C.G. Ahnn J. Cui X. Inouye M. Oncogene. 1988; 6: 539-544Google Scholar). Although its cellular function has not yet been elucidated, the x-ray structure has been recently determined. It consists of a Ras-like GTPase/GTP-binding conserved domain and a KH domain (8Ahnn J. March P.E. Takiff H.E. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8849-8853Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 9Chen X. Court D.L. Ji X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8396-8401Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Theera gene is highly conserved in prokaryotic genomes, indicating its fundamental role in cellular function. The genomic analysis of eubacterial genomes so far determined shows another ubiquitous gene encoding an Era-like GTPase (10Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Nelson W.C. Ketchum K.A. McDonald L. Utterback T.R. Malek J.A. Linher K.D. Garrett M.M. Stewart A.M. Cotton M.D. Pratt M.S. Phillips C.A. Richardson D. Heidelberg J.

Peculiarly, however, the putative gene product contains two highly homologous Era-like GTP-binding domains connected by a short linker peptide (22–46 amino acids). After the tandemly repeated GTP-binding domains, the protein contains another domain of ∼90–122 amino acid residues. This protein is termed Der for a protein withdouble-Era-like domains. In the present study, we purified and biochemically characterized Der from Thermotoga maritima, a hyperthermophilic bacterium. We have also demonstrated that the der gene is essential for cell growth in E. coli by analysis of a der deletion strain. All nucleotides were purchased fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals. [γ-32P]GTP (3,000 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]GTP (3,000 Ci/mmol), and [α-35S]dATP (1,250 Ci/mmol) were purchased fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. Restriction enzymes and DNA modification enzymes were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Life Technologies, Inc., and New England Biolabs. To clone the Tm der gene from T. maritima, the genomic DNA of T. maritimawas used as a template for PCR. Primer 906027, 5′-GCCGCATATGGCGACGGTTCTGATAGT-3′ (an NdeI site is underlined) and 906028, 5′-GCCTAAGCTTCACCTGCTCCTGAACT-3′ (a HindIII site is underlined) were used for PCR. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and HindIII and cloned into the NdeI-HindIII site of pET17b, yielding the pETTmDer plasmid. Primer 959168, 5′-CCTGCAGATGGTCGTTTCGTTGCCC-3′ and 959169, 5′- AGCACATGCTGACATTGTGG-3′ were used for helper plasmid construction. This PCR fragment was cloned into the TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen), then digested with EcoRI, and finally cloned into the EcoRI site of pIE(ts) plasmid, yielding pIEEcttg. Primer 906029, 5′- CCGTCGCTGCAGCGACGGTCTGGTGTTAATCC-3′ (aPstI site is underlined), 906030, 5′-CGCCATGGATCCGCACGCTATATTCGCGTCG-3′ (a BamHI site is underlined), 906031, 5′-CCGGGATCCAGATGCGTAAACGTAAGCG-3′ (a BamHI site is underlined), and 906032, 5′-CCGCCAAGCTTACAGCAACAGCATCCGCA-3′ (a HindIII site is underlined) were used for the construction of the plasmid to replace the E. coli genomic der gene with a kanamycin-resistant gene. The 794-bp fragment encompassing the region upstream of der was amplified by PCR with primers 906029 and 906030 and cloned into the SmaI site of pUC19. The 799-bp fragment encompassing the region downstream of der was also amplified in the same way with the primers 906031 and 906032. Then the 799-bp fragment digested with BamHI-HindIII was inserted into the BamHI-HindIII site of the plasmid harboring 794-bp upstream fragment. The kanamycin gene fragment with BamHI cohesive ends (11Messing J. Vieira J. Gene. 1982; 19: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar) was cloned into theBamHI site of the plasmid harboring both the first (upstream, 794 bp) and the second (downstream, 799 bp) PCR fragment, yielding plasmid pUCDerK. This plasmid was linearized by HindIII enzyme digestion. The strain FS1576 (recD1009 thi-1thr-1 leuB6lacY1 tonA21supE44) (12Stahl F.W. Kobayashi I. Thaler D. Stahl M.M. Genetics. 1986; 113: 215-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) harboring a helper plasmid pIEEcttg was subjected to linear DNA transformation (13Jasin M. Schimmel P. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 783-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the transformants resistant to ampicillin and kanamycin at 30 °C were isolated. The transformants resistant to ampicillin and kanamycin at 30 °C was tested for temperature sensitivity to 42 °C yielding the FK76 strain(der deletion strain). The primers 915013, 5′-GCATATGGTACCTGTGGTCGCGC-3′ (anNdeI site is underlined) and 1302893, 5′-ATGAATTCTTATTTATTTTTCTTGATG-3′ (anEcoRI site is underlined) were used for PCR. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and EcoRI and cloned into the NdeI-EcoRI site of pIN(lpp)p-5IIICm yielding pINEcDer. Cells from a culture were fixed by adding 1.7% formaldehyde, collected by centrifugation, and washed with saline (0.8% sterilized NaCl solution). The washed cells were suspended with an appropriate volume of saline. 10 µl of the sample in saline was spread on a glass slide and dried at room temperature. Methanol was applied in drops onto a dried sample, and the sample was dried at room temperature. After methanol fixation, the slide was washed 10 times with tap water and dried at room temperature, and 10 µl of poly-l-lysine (5 µg/ml of distilled water) was spread over the sample. The slide was dried again at room temperature. DAPI solution (4′,6′-diamino-2-phenyl-indole) (10 µl of 0.1 µg/ml of saline) was applied to the sample, and the oil immersion method was used to observe the sample (14Hiraga S. Niki H. Ogura T. Ichinose C. Mori H. Ezaki B. Jaffé A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1496-1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pETTmDer was introduced intoE. coli BL21(DE3)ndk::Cmrstrain (15Lu Q. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5720-5725Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This ndk disruption strain was used to prevent the contamination of GTPase from nucleoside diphosphate kinase in theT. maritima Der preparation. Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C to mid-exponential phase in 3 liters of M9 medium supplemented with 0.2% Casamino acids and 50 µg of ampicillin per ml. The expression of Tm-Der was induced for 4 h in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside. Tm-Der was expressed at the level of ∼40% of total cellular protein. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 10 mM bis-Tris buffer (pH 7.0), and resuspended in 30 ml of the same buffer. The cells were lysed by two passes through a French press at 9,000 lb/in2followed by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris and unbroken cells, and by ultracentrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 h to remove membrane and insoluble fractions. The soluble fraction was treated at 70 °C for 10 min to denature E. coli proteins and was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min to remove denatured proteins. Ammonium sulfate was then added to the resulting soluble fraction to 80% saturation. The solution was kept on ice for 1 h and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min to obtain precipitates. The ammonium sulfate precipitated fraction was solublized in 20 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 25 mm NaCl and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer A), and the resulting solution was then dialyzed twice against 2 liters of buffer A. The dialyzed sample was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose anion-exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (2.5 × 14 cm), which had been equilibrated with buffer A. Tm-Der was eluted with buffer A using a gradient of 0.025–1 m NaCl. Fractions containing Tm-Der were pooled and precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 80% saturation. The ammonium sulfate precipitate was then solublized in 10 ml of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 400 mm NaCl and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (buffer B), and the solution was dialyzed twice against 2 liters of buffer B. The dialyzed sample was then loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad) (2.5 × 5 cm), which had been equilibrated with buffer B. Tm-Der was eluted with buffer B using a gradient of 10–500 mm potassium phosphate. Fractions containing Tm-Der were pooled and precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 80% saturation. The precipitate was solublized in 2 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol (buffer C), and the solution was dialyzed twice against 1 liter of buffer C. The dialyzed sample was then loaded onto a Blue column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (1.0 × 30 cm), which had been equilibrated with buffer C. Tm-Der was eluted with buffer C using a gradient of 0.05–3m NaCl. Fractions containing Tm-Der were pooled and precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 80% saturation. The precipitate was solublized in 2 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing buffer C, and the solution was dialyzed twice against 1 liter of buffer C. The final yield was 5 mg/liter of culture. CD measurements were performed on an automated AVIV60DS spectrophotometer maintained at 4 °C. The spectra were taken from 260–190 nm. The protein concentration was 0.3 mg/ml, and a path length of 0.1 cm was used. To identify the hydrolyzed products of GTP, [α-32P]GTP was used for the GTPase reaction instead of [γ-32P]GTP. The reaction was carried out in a 50-µl reaction mixture of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 400 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 µm[α-32P]GTP, and 10 µg of purified Tm-Der protein at 70 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by transfer of 5-µl samples to 10 µl of ice-cold 20 mm EDTA. Portions of the terminated reaction mixture were spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography plate, which was developed in 0.75 KH2PO4 (pH 3.65). The plate was autoradiographed to identify products from GTP. Spots corresponding to GTP and GDP were identified by UV-shadowing (6Yamanaka K. Hwang J. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 7078-7082Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out under different conditions, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 µl of 6% active charcoal. The mixture was incubated for 2 min at room temperature, and the supernatant was obtained by centrifugation. 70 µl of the supernatant was used for measurement of the free inorganic phosphate with a liquid scintillation counter. Genome analysis of a number of eubacterial species reveals that these, but not archaeal or eukaryotic cells, share a highly conserved putative GTPase that has tandemly repeated GTP-binding domains at the N-terminal end as shown in Fig. 1 A (10Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Nelson W.C. Ketchum K.A. McDonald L. Utterback T.R. Malek J.A. Linher K.D. Garrett M.M. Stewart A.M. Cotton M.D. Pratt M.S. Phillips C.A. Richardson D. Heidelberg J. Sutton G.G. Fleischmann R.D. White O. Salzberg S.L. Smith H.O. Venter J.C. Fraser C.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). The GTP-binding domains consist of ∼159–170 amino acid residues and show sequence homology to the GTP-binding domain of Era, another GTPase (Fig.1 B). The putative GTPase is thus termed Der, because it has double Era-like GTP-binding domains. Sequence alignments of Der proteins from E. coli, Vibrio cholerae,Hemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bacillus subtilis, and T. maritima shown in Fig. 1 Bdemonstrate that sequence similarities in Der in these Eubacteria are present from the N- to the C-terminal ends. It should be noted that they all contain an unique C-terminal domain of ∼90–122 amino acid residues. A BLAST search did not reveal any sequence similarity to known proteins (data not shown). Interestingly, however, the C-terminal domains of the Der proteins have a high pI value; 10.66 forEc (residues 385–503), 10.58 for Vc (residues 375–494), 10.62 for Hi (residues 385–504), 10.74 forNg (residues 435–485), 9.52 for Bs (residues 337–436), and 10.50 for Tm (residues 343–439). Furthermore, the C-terminal short segments are highly basic regardless of the total lengths of the proteins; for example, there are 6 Lys and 3 Arg residues in the 14-residue sequence in Ec-Der and 2 Lys and 2 Arg residues in the 6-residue sequence of theTm-Der. The structural prediction of the C-terminal domains reveals that they consist mostly of α-helices. In contrast to the C-terminal domains, the linker sequences connecting the N-terminal GTP-binding domain (GB-N) and the C-terminal GTP-binding domain (GB-C) are highly acidic, particularly when Der proteins have a long linker. For example in the 38-residue E. coli linker (from Pro-174 to Pro-211) there are 13 Glu and 6 Asp residues but no basic residues. In the case of Der proteins fromN. gonorrhoeae, B. subtilis, and T. maritima, they contain a short linker sequence of ∼20 residues, which are still acidic. Fig. 1 B shows the alignments of the individual putative GTP-binding domains of E. coli and T. maritimaDer proteins with the GTP-binding domain of the E. coli Era protein, which reveals 46–55% homology. Within the 151-residue GTP-binding domain of Era, there are a total of 23 identical residues throughout the sequences (marked by solid circles) and notably an identical 12-residue sequence in the G1 motif is shared in all five GTP-binding domains. There are 40 residues in Era that show similarities to at least three of the four GTP-binding domains (marked by open circles). It is interesting to note that the G2 motifs are very well conserved within the Der proteins and even between the N-terminal GTP-binding domains (GB-N) and the C-terminal GTP-binding domains (GB-C). However, there is a significantly lower sequence similarity between the Era G2 motif and the Der GB-N and GB-C domains. These facts suggest that both GB-N and GB-C may have the same effector function by interacting with the same effector molecule(s) in the cell, different from an effector molecule interacting with Era. As seen in Fig. 1 A, the G2 motif is highly conserved not only between E. coli and T. maritima but also among all Eubacteria species, indicating that a molecule interacting with the G2 motif sequence has been highly conserved through the evolution of Eubacteria and thus may be an essential housekeeping component shared by all Eubacteria. To determine whether Der is essential for cell growth, the same genetic strategy was used as for Era (7March P.E. Lerner C.G. Ahnn J. Cui X. Inouye M. Oncogene. 1988; 6: 539-544Google Scholar). A helper plasmid carrying the E. coli der gene was constructed. The der gene was cloned by PCR fromE. coli chromosomal DNA and inserted into plasmid pIE(ts), a derivative of pEL3 containing a temperature sensitive origin and an ampicillin-resistant gene (16Armstrong K.A. Acosta R. Lender E. Machida Y. Pancotto M. McCormick M. Ohtsubo H. Ohtsubo E. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 331-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This helper plasmid, pIEEcttg, was transformed into E. coli strain FS1576 (recD1009thi-1 thr-1 leuB6 lacY1tonA21supE44) (12Stahl F.W. Kobayashi I. Thaler D. Stahl M.M. Genetics. 1986; 113: 215-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also constructed a plasmid pUCDerK carrying a der deletion mutation. In theder deletion mutation, the entire deropen-reading frame was replaced with a kanamycin-resistant gene, leaving the 794-bp 5′-upstream sequence (from base −789 to +5; A of the initiation codon, ATG is set as +1) and the 799-bp 3′-downstream sequence (from base +1461 to +2259), yielding plasmid pUCDerK. Subsequently, the strain FS1576 carrying plasmid pIEEcttg was subjected to linear DNA transformation using a linearized DNA fragment from pUCDerK digested by HindIII (13Jasin M. Schimmel P. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 783-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of transformants on LB plates containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin and 35 µg/ml kanamycin were isolated at 30 °C. Replacement of the chromosomal der gene with kanamycin was confirmed by PCR analysis (data not shown). All der deletion strains (total of 16 strains) thus isolated showed a temperature-sensitive phenotype on agar plate, as colony formation was not observed at 42 °C (Fig.2 A). This indicates that Der is required for cell growth. In a liquid culture, the cell growth of FK76 strains continued for 4 h upon a temperature increase from 30 °C to 42 °C (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, in this FK76 strain, cells in a liquid culture at 42 °C were elongated forming long filaments (Fig. 2 C), in which chromosome segregations were also defective as judged by DAPI staining (Fig. 2 C). We also constructed a plasmid carrying the wild-type der gene on pIN(lpp)p-5IIICm vector yielding pINEcDer. When the Δder FK76 harboring pIEEcttg was transformed with theE. coli der-containing plasmid pINEcDer, the transformants (AmprKanr Cmr) obtained at 30 °C were able to form colonies even at 42 °C (data not shown). The colonies obtained at 42 °C were confirmed to be Amps but not Kanr Cmr indicating that the dergene is able to complement the E. coli der deletion strain, and der is required for cell growth. To further characterize Der, we cloned Tm der and purified Tm-Der from E. coli. The Tm der gene was PCR-amplified and cloned into a T7 expression vector. In order to avoid the contamination of GTPase activity from E. coli nucleoside diphosphate kinase,E. coli BL21 (DE3) ndk::Cmrstrain (15Lu Q. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5720-5725Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was used as a host. Tm-Der was highly expressed in the presence of isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside at a level of 40% total cellular protein (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). The cell lysate was incubated at 70 °C for 10 min to remove as much as possible of the E. coli protein and thus Tm-Der was recovered in the soluble protein fraction (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). Tm-Der was subsequently purified by column chromatography with Q-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, and Blue column. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis pattern of the final product is shown in lane 4 of Fig. 3 A. The yield was approximately 5 mg/liter. The purified Tm-Der shows a CD spectrum of a typical α-helix and β-sheet protein (Fig. 3 B). Using purified Tm-Der, high quality crystals giving a 2.2 Å resolution have been obtained, and its structure studied. 2V. Robinson, and A. Stock, personal communication. Using purified Tm-Der, the GTPase assay was carried out at 70 °C with [α-32P]GTP using the conditions described under "Experimental Procedures." The reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA, and the reaction products were analyzed by TLC. As shown in Fig.4 A, (lanes 1–8), GTP was almost completely converted to GDP after a 60-min incubation. Under the same condition in the absence of Tm-Der, GTP to GDP conversion was not observed (Fig. 4 A, lanes 11 and12). As observed from the phosphorimager analysis of the TLC, the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP occurred linearly for up to 10 min (data not shown). GTPase activity can also be assayed with [γ-32P]GTP by measuring the amount of32Pi released as described under "Experimental Procedures." To obtain optimal GTPase assay conditions for Tm-Der, temperature dependence (Fig.5 A), pH dependence (Fig.5 B), salt effect (Fig. 5 C), and the effect of Mg2+ were tested. The temperature dependence experiment (Fig. 5 A) was carried out in a 50-µl reaction mixture in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm[γ-32P]GTP, and 10 µg Tm-Der. The reaction was initiated by the addition of Tm-Der and stopped by the addition of activated charcoal. The amount of 32Pi released in the supernatant was measured to calculate the amount of GTP hydrolysis. At 70 °C, GTP hydrolysis was linear during a 20-min incubation and linearly dependent on the amount of Tm-Der used up to 10 µg in the reaction mixture (data not shown). Interestingly, the GTPase of Tm-Der was activated by KCl but not by NaCl (Fig.5 C), and required Mg2+ (data not shown). The addition of EDTA quite effectively blocked the GTPase activity (data not shown). From these experiments, kinetic characterization of Tm-Der was carried out under the following condition; for 10 min at 70 °C in a 50-µl reaction mixture in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm MgCl2, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 10 µm [γ-32P]GTP, and 10 µg Tm-Der. Using these conditions, competition experiments were carried out with a number of nucleotides (Fig. 4 B). In the presence of 3 mm competitors (300-fold excess), GTP, GDP, and dGTP were strong competitors, whereas GMP as well as ATP, ADP, and AMP were not inhibitory. An excess of CTP, UTP, dATP, dCTP, and dTTP inhibited the reaction to some extent; however, the reason for this competition is not known at present.Figure 5Effects of reaction temperature, pH, and salt on the GTPase activity of Tm-Der. A, the GTPase assay was carried out in a 50-µl reaction mixture containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmDTT, 10 µm [γ-32P]GTP, and 10 µg of Tm-Der for 10 min at different temperatures. The GTPase assay was stopped by adding activated charcoal powders followed by centrifugation, and 32Pi released into the supernatant was counted with a liquid scintillation counter.B, the GTPase assay was carried out in a 50-µl reaction mixture between pH 6.5 and 9.0 (50 mm Tris-HCl) and at pH 9.5 and 10.0 (50 mm3-(cyclohexylamino)-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid). Both buffers contained 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 µm [γ-32P]GTP, and 10 µg of Tm-Der. The assay was carried out at 70 °C for 10 min. C, the GTPase assay was carried out in a 50-µl reaction mixture: 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmDTT, 10 µm [γ-32P]GTP, 10 µg of TM-Der, and different concentrations (0–1 m) of KCl or NaCl for 10 min at 70 °C. Open circle, KCl; solid circle,NaCl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When [γ-32P]ATP was substituted, under the same conditions, for [γ-32P]GTP, no32Pi release was detected (data not shown), indicating that Tm-Der has no ATPase activity. An enzymatic kinetic experiment was carried out using GTP concentrations of 0.1–2 mm under the optimal conditions described above. The Lineweaver-Burk plot thus obtained is shown in Fig.6, from which Kmand V max values were estimated to be 110 µm and 3.5 µm/min, respectively. Thek cat value was thus calculated to be 0.87 min−1. In the present study, we have demonstrated that Tm-Der is indeed a GTPase whose Km and V maxvalues are 110 and 3.46 µm/min, respectively. Thek cat value was estimated to be 0.87 min−1 (Fig. 6). GTP, GDP, and dGTP were able to compete for binding to Tm-Der (Fig. 4 B). The same results were observed in the competition assay for the E. coli Der. Some inhibitory effects by dATP, dTTP, dCTP, UTP, and CTP were also observed (data not shown). der is exclusively conserved in all eubacterial genomes sequenced as yet (Fig. 1); however, it is not known why deris not conserved in eukaryotic or archaeal genomes. It has been suggested that for one of the Eubacteria, N. gonorrhoeae, an ortholog of Der, EngA (essential neisserialGTP-binding protein A) is essential for cell growth similar to E. coli der (17Mehr I.J. Long C.D. Serkin C.D. Seifert H.S. Genetics. 2000; 154: 523-532PubMed Google Scholar). A BLAST search against Der protein sequences showed all the ortholog sequences from different Eubacteria (data not shown). Der from Streptococcus mutanswas assigned as d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, SerA (18Kawabata S. Terao Y. Hamada S. Oral. Microbial. Immunol. 2000; 15: 58-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this gene is unlikely to be SerA because no significant amino acid sequence similarity between SerA and Der in E. coli and B. subtilis was observed, and SerA has no GTP-binding motifs: G1, G3, and G4 (18Kawabata S. Terao Y. Hamada S. Oral. Microbial. Immunol. 2000; 15: 58-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mittenhuber G. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 21-35PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that at non-permissive temperature, the derdeletion strain (FK76) stops growing after around a 4-h temperature increase (Fig. 2 B), and the antibiotic-independent temperature sensitivity (Fig. 2 A) of theder::kan mutant strains bearing the temperature-sensitive helper plasmid pIEEcttg proves that the presence of Der on helper plasmid is essentially required for cell viability (7March P.E. Lerner C.G. Ahnn J. Cui X. Inouye M. Oncogene. 1988; 6: 539-544Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 C, der deletion strain cells became elongated under non-permissive conditions, and the chromosome segregations were defective, implying that Der perhaps plays a role in cell division and/or the chromosome segregation process. Peculiarly, the transparent vacuole-like structure (indicated by anarrowhead) was observed, which is a quite uncommon morphological feature. The number and localization of this transparent object varies randomly in the cell, and it is not known yet why inder deletion strains this object appears. As a molecular switch, GTP-binding proteins of eukaryotes or prokaryotes are tightly regulated inside the cell by GAPs and GNRPs. GTP hydrolysis and GTP-GDP exchanges are crucial for cellular events such as signal transduction (e.g. small G proteins), protein translation (e.g. EF-Tu), cell growth (e.g. Ras), vesicular transport (e.g. RAB), and protein translocation across membranes (e.g. SRP), etc. (1Bourene H.R.

Acta. 1998; 1385: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Der has an interesting primary amino acid sequence with two tandemly repeated GTP-binding domain sequences followed by a C-terminal domain. This suggests that probably, Der has a novel GTPase activity where the G2 motif interacts with an effector(s) molecule that may be involved in cell division and/or chromosome segregation. The G2 motif has been known to interact with an effector molecule such as GAP, which regulates the hydrolysis of GTP bound to GTPases. Because of highly similar primary sequences between its tandemly repeated GTP-binding domains within a single molecule, their three dimensional structures are expected to be very similar because the structures of the bacterial EF-Tu and p21ras GTP-binding domain even from different organisms are very superimposable (2Bourene H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). It is probable that each GTP-binding domain may interact with a different effector molecule, resulting in a sequential GTP-GDP cycle or in a synchronized GTP-GDP cycle. 3P. Yoong, C. E. Caldon, and P. E. March (2000), unpublished data. A single effector molecule, also, may interact with G2 motifs of two GTP-binding domains so that this interaction may give rise to a similar GTP-GDP cycle, because G2 motif sequences between N- and C-terminal GTP-binding domains are highly similar to each other. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that only one of the two GTP-binding domains in Der is a truly functional GTP-binding domain. The identification of the effector molecule is important for our understanding of Der function. We now have high quality resolution data at 2.2 Å from Tm-Der crystals.2 The structural determination of Der will provide an insight into the role of the two GTP-binding domains and the function of Der.

TITLE: Involvement of Jun and Rel Proteins in Up-regulation of Interleukin-4 Gene Activity by the T Cell Accessory Molecule CD28
ABSTRACT: CD28 serves as a costimulatory cell surface molecule in T cell activation. CD28 signaling may also play a role in balancing the inflammatory/humoral (Th1/Th2) responses during an immune reaction. CD28 costimulation has been shown to promote the production of Th2 cytokines including interleukin (IL)-4, a key cytokine essential for Th2 differentiation and for the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation. In this study, we show that IL-4 mRNA and activity of the IL-4 promoter can be activated by the CD28 signal alone and are further augmented by CD28 costimulation of α-CD3- or mitogen-activated Jurkat T cells. Two important IL-4 enhancer elements, positive regulatory element (PRE)-I and P1, are found to respond to CD28 stimulation-induced transactivation. In contrast to the Th1 IL-2 CD28RE, activity of the IL-4 PRE-I and P1 can be induced by the CD28 signal alone. In correlation with CD28-induced transcriptional activation, AP-1 (c-Jun, JunD) and NF-κB/Rel (c-Rel, RelA) family members are found to bind to the two regulatory elements PRE-I and P1 upon CD28 stimulation. The data provide the first mapping of the CD28-responsive site in a Th2 cytokine gene, the IL-4 gene. They also show that the CD28 signal can directly activate a gene (e.g. IL-4) at the transcriptional level. CD28 serves as a costimulatory cell surface molecule in T cell activation.

Activation of T cells during an immune response requires two distinct signals: one from the engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR)1 with specific major histocompatibility complex antigens presenting peptides on antigen-presenting cells and a second signal originating from other cell surface receptors/ligands that mediate costimulation (1Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Work over the last several years has demonstrated that the CD28 glycoprotein, expressed on the surface of 80% of human T cells and on virtually all murine T cells, is one of the major costimulatory molecules (2June C.H. Bluestone J.A. Nadler L.M. Thompson C.B. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 321-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 3Lenschow D.J. Walunas T.L. Bluestone J.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 233-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar). Ligation of CD28 with anti-CD28 (α-CD28) monoclonal antibodies (mAb) or cells expressing CD28 ligands (B7–1 and B7–2) in combination with limited concentrations of anti-CD3 (α-CD3) or antigen promotes cell cycle progression and increases interleukin (IL)-2 production by regulating IL-2 mRNA at both the level of transcription and translation (for a review, see Ref. 4Bluestone J.A. Immunity. 1995; 2: 555-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Thus, CD28 can deliver biochemical signals that function in synergy with TCR-mediated signaling to initiate and maintain T cell responses. Recent findings indicate that CD28 ligation acts not only synergistically with TCR ligation to maximize T cell signaling but also promotes cell differentiation. Several studies both in mice (5Shahinian A. Pfeffer K. Lee K.P. Kundig T.M. Kishihara K. Wakeham A. Kawai K. Ohashi P.S. Thompson C.B. Mak T.W.

Immunol. 1995; 25: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 10Webb L.M. Feldmann M. Blood. 1995; 86: 3479-3486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Palmer E.M. van Seventer G.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2654-2662PubMed Google Scholar) support a fundamental role for CD28 in the early differentiation of T helper (Th) subsets toward a Th2 phenotype. In the absence of CD28 signaling, naive T cells are biased toward a Th1 phenotype. Th2 cells, which produce IL-4, -5, -6, -10, and -13, regulate humoral immune responses and Th1 cells, which secrete IL-2, tumor necrosis factor-β, and interferon-γ, are involved in cell-mediated and delayed type hypersensitivity immune responses. Thus, CD28 signaling may regulate the balance of inflammatory/humoral (Th1/Th2) responses during an immune reaction. It has been shown that CD28 costimulation may directly promote the production of Th2 cytokines (12Rulifson I.C. Sperling A.I. Fields P.E. Fitch F.W. Bluestone J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 658-665PubMed Google Scholar). Both in humans (9King C.L. Stupi R.J. Craighead N. June C.H. Thyphronitis G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and in mice (12Rulifson I.C. Sperling A.I. Fields P.E. Fitch F.W. Bluestone J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 658-665PubMed Google Scholar), increased CD28 ligation resulted in increased production of IL-4 and IL-5. Purified naive human T cells stimulated with α-CD3 in the absence of CD28 costimulation produce only IL-2 and interferon-γ, whereas the addition of α-CD28 mAb induced IL-4 (9King C.L. Stupi R.J. Craighead N. June C.H. Thyphronitis G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). IL-4 is a pleiotropic cytokine with a wide rage of biological effects on many hemopoietic and nonhemopoietically derived cells and tissues (13Paul W.E. Blood. 1991; 77: 1859-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-4 is also a well known cytokine that plays a central role in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation by promoting Ig class switching to IgE (13Paul W.E. Blood. 1991; 77: 1859-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years, IL-4 was also shown to be the major determining factor in the differentiation of naive T cells into the Th2 phenotype and facilitating the humoral immune response (6Seder R.A. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 635-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar, 14Le Gros G. Ben-Sasson S.Z. Seder R. Finkelman F.D. Paul W.E. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). In the absence of IL-4, Th cells develop mainly into the Th1 phenotype (15Parronchi P. de Carli M. Manetti R. Simonelli C. Sampognaro S. Piccinni M.P. Macchia D. Maggi E. del Prete G. Romagnani S. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2977-2985PubMed Google Scholar,16Maggi E. Parronchi P. Manetti R. Simonelli C. Piccinni M.P. Rugiu F.S. De Carli M. Ricci M. Romagnani S. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2142-2147PubMed Google Scholar). Up-regulation of the IL-4 production by CD28 signaling may be one of the mechanisms that promotes Th2 differentiation. The effect of CD28 on transcriptional activity of the Th1 IL-2 gene has been intensively studied. A NF-κB-like sequence between −164 and −154 and an adjacent AP-1 site of the IL-2 promoter was found to respond to the CD28 signal (17Fraser J.D. Irving B.A. Crabtree G.R. Weiss A. Science. 1991; 251: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 18Verweij C.L. Geerts M. Aarden L.A. J. Biol.

NF-κB/Rel and AP-1 transcription factors were found to participate in the formation of the CD28-responsive element-specific complex and to be involved in CD28-stimulated transactivation (20McGuire K.L. Iacobelli M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1319-1327PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ghosh P. Tan T. Rice N.R. Sica A. Young H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4260-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, several IL-2 NF-AT sites were found to respond to CD28 costimulation. CD28 inducibility was shown to be conferred by the AP-1 component in NF-AT/AP-1 composite elements (24Rooney J.W. Sun Y-L. Glimcher L.H. Hoey T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Although the CD28-responsive element of the IL-2 gene has been well studied, the CD28 response element of the IL-4 gene has not been characterized. Like the IL-2 gene, the IL-4 gene is regulated by multiple regulatory elements (for a review see Ref. 25Li-Weber M. Laur O. Davydov I.V. Hu C. Salgame P. Krammer P.H. Immunobiology. 1997; 198: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide the first report of CD28-responsive elements (CD28REs) in the IL-4 promoter. We show that two IL-4 promoter elements, PRE-I and P1, are responsive to the CD28 stimulation signal. In contrast to the IL-2 CD28RE, transcriptional activity of the IL-4 CD28REs can be activated by the CD28 signal alone. Upon CD28 stimulation, AP-1 (c-Jun, JunD) and NF-κB (c-Rel, p65/RelA) family proteins bind to these two elements and are involved in governing the CD28 responsiveness of the two elements. PRE-I and P1 belong to the most important regulatory elements of the IL-4 gene (26Abe E., R. Malefyt D.W. Matsuda I. Arai K. Arai N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2864-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Li-Weber M. Krafft H. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1371-1382PubMed Google Scholar, 28Chuvpilo S. Schomberg C. Gerwig R. Heinfling A. Reeves Grummt R.F. Serfling E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5694-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Both sites are also shown to be involved in Th2-specific protein/DNA interactions and to be the potential regulatory elements for Th2-specific expression of the IL-4 gene (29Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Davydov I.V. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1194-1200PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wenner C.A. Szabo S.J. Murphy K.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 765-773PubMed Google Scholar). The finding of PRE-I and P1 as CD28REs may lead to a better understanding of CD28-mediated activation of the IL-4 gene. The cells used in this study were the human T-lymphoblastoid cell line Jurkat (J16-77). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies), 6 mmHEPES (Life Technologies; 1 m solution), and 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies; 200 mm solution). Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed with oligo(dT). PCR amplification was then performed for 35 cycles with specific primers (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) for the human IL-4 (456-base pair PCR product) and the human β-actin (661-base pair PCR product) protein, respectively. The PCR products were then subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. The luciferase reporter plasmid pLuc-IL4 (−269/+11) was constructed as described previously (31Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Davydov I.V. Laur O. Klevenz S. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1380-1389PubMed Google Scholar). Multimer constructs containing DNA sequence of 1–3 copies of P1 (AATCTGGTGTAACGAAAATTTCCAATGTA) and PRE-I (AGCAAATTATGGTGTAATTTCCTATGCTGAA) and four copies of NF-κB consensus binding site (TCAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGAGGCG) were constructed by ligation of each DNA sequence into the multicloning site of pATAT-Luc vector (a kind gift from Dr. T. Wirth, Institut für Medizinische Strahlen und Zellforschung, Würzburg, Germany). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing analysis. The p65/RelA expression plasmid (pCMV-p65) was kindly supplied by Dr. K. Schulze-Osthoff, Medizinische Klinik, Universität Tübingen, Germany). The c-Rel expression plasmid (pRSV-cRel) was kindly supplied by Dr. R. M. Schmid (Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik, Universität Ulm). Jurkat T cells were transiently transfected by electroporation. 4 × 106/ml cells in RPMI 1640 medium and 15 μg of reporter plasmids were electroporated using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad GmbH, München, Germany) set at 960 microfarads, 240 V. The transfected cells were allowed to recovered overnight and divided into aliquots. Each aliquot was further treated with α-CD3 mAb (OKT3 coated at 10 μg/ml), α-CD28 mAb (5 μg/ml), or α-CD3 plus anti-CD28 mAb for 8 and 16 h. Luciferase activity was determined in 10 μl of cell extract using the luciferase assay substrate (Promega) with an Duolumat LB9507 luminometer (Berthold, Germany). Nuclear extracts from Jurkat T cells unstimulated and stimulated for 2 h with either α-CD3 mAb (OKT3 coated at 10 μg/ml) or α-CD3 plus α-CD28 mAb (5 μg/ml) were prepared as described previously (29Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Davydov I.V. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1194-1200PubMed Google Scholar). EMSA was performed as published previously (29Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Davydov I.V. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1194-1200PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody analyses were done by preincubating the nuclear extracts with 1–2 μl of indicated antibodies for 20 min before adding the end-labeled probe. The synthetic oligonucleotides used for EMSA and competition experiments were as follows.

(Santa Cruz, CA). The α-NF-κB/RelA(p65) antibody was purchased from Rockland (Gilbertsville, PA). Antibody specific for c-Jun B was kindly supplied by Dr. P. Angel (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany). The α-NF-ATc mAb (MA3–024) was purchased from Affinity BioReagents, Inc. (Golden, CO). CD28 costimulation has been shown to increase production of IL-4 protein both in human and mouse T cells (9King C.L. Stupi R.J. Craighead N. June C.H. Thyphronitis G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 12Rulifson I.C. Sperling A.I. Fields P.E. Fitch F.W. Bluestone J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 658-665PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the CD28 signal involved in expression of the human IL-4 gene at the transcriptional level, we chose an IL-4-producing Jurkat T cell subline for our studies. Stimulation of Jurkat cells with phytohemogglutinin or α-CD3 (OKT3) mAb alone resulted in induction of IL-4 mRNA expression. The production of IL-4 mRNA was clearly increased upon co-stimulation with α-CD28 mAbs in Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1). CD28 is known to serve as a costimulatory cell surface molecule in T cell activation. Interestingly, we observed that stimulation of Jurkat cells with α-CD28 mAb alone could induce a low but significant level of IL-4 mRNA expression. The capability of α-CD28 mAb in induction of IL-4 mRNA expression was also observed in a second Jurkat T cell line (data not shown). This indicates that CD28 ligation does not only provide a costimulatory signal but may also directly induce expression of the IL-4 gene at the transcriptional level. The experiments also demonstrate that the CD28 signal is involved in generating a high level of IL-4 expression in Jurkat T cells. To investigate the biological function of the human IL-4 promoter in response to CD3 and CD28 signals, the human IL-4 promoter fragment −269 to +11 (which contains the important regulatory elements identified so far) was placed in front of the luciferase reporter gene. Activities of the IL-4 promoter were analyzed by transfection of the IL-4-luciferase construct into Jurkat T cells. The experiments showed that stimulation of Jurkat cells with α-CD3 mAb alone resulted in a 3-fold (for 8-h stimulation) to 7-fold (for 16-h stimulation) induction of IL-4 promoter activity. When the cells were costimulated with α-CD28 mAb, the IL-4 promoter activity was enhanced. A 6-fold (for 8-h costimulation) to 9-fold (for 16-h costimulation) increase in IL-4 promoter activity was obtained (Fig. 2). Stimulation of the cells with α-CD28 mAb alone for 8 h also led to an increase of promoter activity to a similar level as that stimulated by α-CD3 mAb alone. The effect of the CD28 signal on IL-4 promoter activity was more pronounced at the early stage (8 h) than the later stage of stimulation (16 h) (Fig. 2). Therefore, the following transfection experiments were performed at 8 h of stimulation. The IL-4 −269 to +1 promoter fragment contains multiple regulatory transcriptional elements (25Li-Weber M. Laur O. Davydov I.V. Hu C. Salgame P. Krammer P.H. Immunobiology. 1997; 198: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To study the CD28-responsive DNA binding sites of the IL-4 promoter, we prepared nuclear proteins from Jurkat T cells unstimulated and stimulated by α-CD3, α-CD28 or a combination of α-CD3 and α-CD28 mAbs and analyzed them by EMSA. Two regulatory elements, PRE-I at −250 to −221 (27Li-Weber M. Krafft H. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1371-1382PubMed Google Scholar) and P (also referred as P1) at −77 to −67 (26Abe E., R. Malefyt D.W. Matsuda I. Arai K. Arai N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2864-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 32Szabo S.J. Gold J.S. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4793-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) were shown to interact with nuclear proteins of cells stimulated with α-CD28 or α-CD3/α-CD28 mAbs (Fig. 3). Two complexes (PRE-I-I and PRE-I-II), detected by the PRE-I probe, and three complexes (P1-I, P-1-II, and P1-III) detected by the P1 probe were clearly shown in CD28-stimulated cells. P1-I and P1-II were also formed in CD3 stimulated cells. Formation of P1-I and P1-II was enhanced in cells stimulated with both α-CD3 and α-CD28 mAbs (Fig. 3). In contrast, PRE-I-I was not found in cells stimulated by α-CD3 mAb alone. Formation of PRE-I-I was not increased by CD28/CD3 costimulation. PRE-I-II and P1-III could be detected in nonstimulated cells. Formation of these two complexes was increased upon induction. The data indicate that PRE-I and P1 are the binding sites for CD28-induced nuclear factors and, therefore, may be the sites responsive to CD28 signaling. To investigate the transcriptional activity of PRE-I and P1 upon CD28 costimulation, we constructed luciferase reporter plasmids each containing 1–3 copies of the PRE-I or the P1 element linked to a minimal promoter containing a TATA box only. The biological function of the two elements was analyzed by transfection of the constructs into Jurkat T cells. For controls, four copies of the NF-κB consensus binding site were also constructed in the luciferase-TATA plasmid and used in the transfection studies. The experiments showed that three copies of both elements could confer CD28-dependent inducibility to the reporter gene (Fig. 4). However, one and two copies of the elements were not sufficient to respond to CD28 stimulation. Differences in response to CD3 stimulation were observed between the two elements. Stimulation with α-CD3 mAb alone did not induce transcriptional activity mediated by the PRE-I multimer construct. In contrast, α-CD3 mAb alone induced more than 8-fold expression of the multimerized P1 element (Fig. 4). CD28 ligation was shown to act synergistically with TCR ligation to increase the transcription on the P1 element. The TATA-luciferase vector did not respond to any stimuli (data not shown). The experiments demonstrate that PRE-I and P1 are responsive to CD28 signaling, and the transcriptional activity of the two elements correlates with the DNA binding activity analyzed. AP-1 proteins have been shown to play a role in CD28 inducibility (20McGuire K.L. Iacobelli M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1319-1327PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rooney J.W. Sun Y-L. Glimcher L.H. Hoey T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 33Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that in Jurkat T cells proteins of the AP-1 family are involved in binding to PRE-I upon phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or PMA/ionomycin stimulation (29Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Davydov I.V. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1194-1200PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize the α-CD3 and α-CD28 mAb-induced complexes, oligonucleotides containing binding sites for several known inducible factors were used as DNA competitors in EMSA. The experiment showed that formation of the CD28-inducible complex PRE-I-I was specifically competed by an excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotides containing the AP-1 and NF-AT binding sites (Fig. 5). To further investigate whether AP-1 proteins are involved in binding to PRE-I upon CD28 stimulation, α-c-Jun/AP-1, broadly reactive with c-Jun, JunB, and Jun p39 proteins and α-c-Fos (k-25), broadly reactive with c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2, were used in EMSA. Antibody analysis showed that in α-CD28-treated cells, α-c-Jun/AP-1 antibody slightly supershifted PRE-I-I. No effect was obtained by the α-c-Fos antibody (Fig. 6 A). This indicates that PRE-I-I may contain proteins of the Jun family. We further investigated the components of the PRE-I binding complexes using antibodies specifically against c-Jun, JunB, or JunD. Our experiments showed that PRE-I-I and PRE-I-II were supershifted by α-JunD Ab (Fig. 6A). Formation of PRE-I-I was also blocked by α-c-Jun Ab (Fig. 6 A). The experiments demonstrate that CD28 stimulation leads to binding of c-Jun and JunD to PRE-I. We also investigated whether the components of PRE-I binding complexes changed in α-CD3/α-CD28-costimulated cells. In contrast to the cells stimulated by α-CD28 alone, in the α-CD3/α-CD28-stimulated cells, PRE-I-I was completely blocked by the α-c-Jun/AP-1 antibody (Fig. 6 B), indicating that the components of PRE-I-I in α-CD3/α-CD28-stimulated cells may differ from those in α-CD28-stimulated cells. Indeed, α-JunB Ab, which did not interfere with the formation of PRE-I-I in the α-CD28-stimulated cells, reduced PRE-I-I in the α-CD3/α-CD28-stimulated cells (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, α-c-Jun Ab interfered with the formation of PRE-I-I in α-CD28-stimulated cells but not in the α-CD3/α-CD28-stimulated cells. JunD was detected in the PRE-I binding complexes in both α-CD28- and α-CD3/α-CD28-stimulated cells. Fos was not found to participate in binding to PRE-I in α-CD28- or the α-CD3/α-CD28-stimulated cells.Figure 6Antibody analysis of the PRE-I binding nuclear factors. EMSA was carried out with nuclear extracts prepared from α-CD28- or α-CD3/α-CD28-induced Jurkat T cells in the presence of the antibodies indicated. −, assays were carried out without antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Formation of PRE-I-II was enhanced after CD3 stimulation (Fig. 3). Competition experiments showed that formation of PRE-I-II was competed by NF-κB and NF-AT oligonucleotides (Fig. 5). Antibody analysis showed that PRE-I-II formed in α-CD3/α-CD28-stimulated cells reacted with the α-p65 and α-NF-ATc antibodies, indicating participation of p65 and NF-AT in PRE-I-II formation upon α-CD3 stimulation (Fig. 6). The P1 site (located at −67 to −77) shares DNA sequence homology with the NF-AT as well as the NF-κB consensus sequence and was shown to interact with both NF-AT and NF-κB upon PMA and A23187 induction (34Casolaro V. Georas S.N. Song Z. Zubkoff I.D. Abdulkadir S.A. Thanos D. Ono S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11623-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Competition experiments showed that formation of the inducible P1 complexes were competed by oligonucleotides containing the NF-AT and NF-κB binding sites (Fig. 5). The P1 probe used in our EMSA experiments did not contain the putative AP-1 site (25Li-Weber M. Laur O. Davydov I.V. Hu C. Salgame P. Krammer P.H. Immunobiology. 1997; 198: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, formation of all three inducible P1 complexes was competed by the AP-1 oligonucleotide, indicating that AP-1 proteins might be involved in binding to the P1 site (Fig. 5). Antibody analysis of the P1 binding complexes of the α-CD28-stimulated cells showed that all three complexes were supershifted by the α-JunD Ab (Fig. 7). Therefore, JunD was also involved in binding to the P1 site in α-CD28-stimulated cells (Fig. 7 A). Besides, α-p65/RelA and α-c-Rel Abs blocked formation of P1-I demonstrating that c-Rel and RelA of the NF-κB proteins were involved in binding to the P1 site upon CD28 stimulation (Fig. 7 A). In α-CD3/α-CD28-stimulated cells, α-c-Fos and α-NF-ATc Abs also reduced formation of the P1 binding complexes, indicating that NF-AT and other members of the AP-1 family of proteins may form the P1-binding complexes upon CD3 stimulation (Fig. 7 B). The above studies demonstrate that JunD, p65/RelA, and c-Rel are involved in binding to the IL-4 promoter regulatory elements during CD28 costimulation. Engagement of the TCR leads to activation of two (the protein kinase C and the calmodulin-dependent) signal transduction pathways. It is known that PMA activates protein kinase C and that calcium ionophores (such as ionomycin and A23187) increase the level of intracellular free Ca2+. Therefore, the physiological stimulation of T cells via TCR may be mimicked by the combination of PMA and ionomycin. Previously, Casolaro et al. (34Casolaro V. Georas S.N. Song Z. Zubkoff I.D. Abdulkadir S.A. Thanos D. Ono S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11623-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) reported that activation of human IL-4 transcription through A23187 was diminished by PMA in Jurkat T cells and that overexpression of RelA down-regulated human IL-4 promoter activity in A23187-stimulated Jurkat T cells. They proposed that NF-κB (activated by PMA) may compete with NF-AT (activated by A23187) for binding to the P1 site and, consequently, inhibit NF-AT-dependent transcription at this site. To investigate the functional relevance of NF-κB on the P1 site upon CD3 stimulation, we cotransfected the P1 multimer construct together with a RelA or a c-Rel expression plasmid into Jurkat T cells. As shown in Fig. 8, overexpression of RelA or c-Rel increased the P1-mediated transcription in CD3-stimulated Jurkat T cells. Therefore, NF-κB may enhance transcriptional activity at the P1 site in physiologically stimulated T cells. In recent years, experimental evidence showed that signal transduction through CD28 not only augmented TCR-mediated proliferation, IL-2 production, and T cell survival but also played an important role in differentiation of Th cells into either type 1 or type 2 cells (11Palmer E.M. van Seventer G.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2654-2662PubMed Google Scholar, 35Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1996; 4: 527-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). CD28 costimulation has been shown to promote production of Th2 cytokines including IL-4 (12Rulifson I.C. Sperling A.I. Fields P.E. Fitch F.W. Bluestone J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 658-665PubMed Google Scholar). Blocking the CD28-B7 interaction blocks the induction of IL-4 synthesis (5Shahinian A. Pfeffer K. Lee K.P. Kundig T.M. Kishihara K. Wakeham A. Kawai K. Ohashi P.S. Thompson C.B. Mak T.W. Science. 1993; 261: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 6Seder R.A. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev.

Science. 1992; 257: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar), indicating that CD28 costimulation is important in regulation of IL-4 synthesis. Since IL-4 is not only a critical cytokine for Th2 differentiation but also plays a central role in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation, we investigated the CD28-responsive element of the human IL-4 promoter. We show here that IL-4 mRNA levels and activity of the IL-4 promoter are increased by CD28 costimulation of α-CD3- or mitogen-activated Jurkat T cells. Interestingly, in addition, we found that α-CD28 mAb alone could induce IL-4 mRNA expression and activate the IL-4 promoter to a significant level. This indicates that CD28 ligation, so far known to provide a costimulatory signal in T cell activation, may also directly activate transcription. Two of the IL-4 promoter regulatory elements, PRE-I and P1, are shown to confer CD-28-stimulation-induced transactivation. PRE-I was previously shown to interact with AP-1 and NF-AT in Th2 cells (29Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Davydov I.V. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1194-1200PubMed Google Scholar). AP-1 transcriptional activity in T cells has been shown to be strongly induced by α-CD28 induction (37Rincon M. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4370-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and CD28 costimulation is necessary for the optimal activation of AP-1, via c-Jun phosphorylation (33Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the multimerized PRE-I element may contribute to an approximately 4-fold transcriptional activation in response to CD28 signaling. Our experiments also show that binding of c-Jun and JunD to PRE-I is specifically induced via CD28 stimulation. These data indicate that PRE-I may be a CD28-responsive element in the IL-4 gene. P1 contains a strong NF-AT binding site (24Rooney J.W. Sun Y-L. Glimcher L.H. Hoey T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 25Li-Weber M. Laur O. Davydov I.V. Hu C. Salgame P. Krammer P.H. Immunobiology. 1997; 198: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It also shares DNA sequence similarity with the DNA binding sequence for NF-κB and binds both NF-AT and proteins of the NF-κB family (34Casolaro V. Georas S.N. Song Z. Zubkoff I.D. Abdulkadir S.A. Thanos D. Ono S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11623-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The corresponding P1 sequence in the human IL-4 promoter differs by two nucleotides from the mouse sequence (TGGAAATTTC instead of TGGAAAATTTT) and was shown to bind NF-AT with 4-fold lower affinity and NF-κB with 4-fold higher affinity than does the mouse sequence (34Casolaro V. Georas S.N. Song Z. Zubkoff I.D. Abdulkadir S.A. Thanos D. Ono S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11623-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It has been well established that the Rel-related κB proteins are downstream targets in CD28 signaling (38Snapper C.M. Zelazowski P. Rosas F.R. Kehry M.R. Tian M. Baltimore D. Sha W.C. J.

Cell. 1995; 80: 331-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). CD28 stimulation can directly activate the NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors via down-regulating the expression of the NF-κB inhibitor I-κB and increasing the nuclear translocation of NF-κB/Rel (22Bryan R.G.

NF-κB/Rel transcription factors are found to participate in the formation of the IL-2 CD28-responsive element-specific complex and to be involved in CD28-stimulated transactivation (21Ghosh P. Tan T. Rice N.R. Sica A. Young H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1696-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 22Bryan R.G. Li Y. Lai J.H. Van M. Rice N.R. Rich R.R. Tan T.H. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4260-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We show here that JunD, c-Rel, and p65/Rel are involved in binding to the IL-4 promoter P1 element after CD28 stimulation. The multimerized P1 element confers 6–8-fold inducible transcriptional activity to the reporter gene upon CD28 stimulation. The data suggest that P1 may be the second CD28-responsive site of the IL-4 gene and that JunD and Rel-related proteins are involved in activation at this site. PRE-I and P1 elements were previously shown to be essential for expression of the human (27Li-Weber M. Krafft H. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1371-1382PubMed Google Scholar) and murine (28Chuvpilo S. Schomberg C. Gerwig R. Heinfling A. Reeves Grummt R.F. Serfling E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5694-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) IL-4 gene. Deletion or mutation of PRE-I and P1 leads to impairment of both basal and inducible activity of the IL-4 promoter (26Abe E., R. Malefyt D.W. Matsuda I. Arai K. Arai N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2864-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Li-Weber M. Krafft H. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1371-1382PubMed Google Scholar, 28Chuvpilo S. Schomberg C. Gerwig R. Heinfling A. Reeves Grummt R.F. Serfling E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5694-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 31Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Davydov I.V. Laur O. Klevenz S. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1380-1389PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that PRE-I and P1 may play an important role in the differential regulation of IL-4 gene expression levels in Th2 cells (29Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Davydov I.V. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1194-1200PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wenner C.A. Szabo S.J. Murphy K.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 765-773PubMed Google Scholar). The finding of PRE-I and P1 as the CD28-responsive sites further confirms the importance of the two elements for IL-4 gene expression and also demonstrates that the CD28 signal regulates IL-4 gene expression through the most important regulatory elements. Differences between the IL-2 CD28RE and the IL-4 PRE-I and P1 are observed. 1) Inducible binding of nuclear factors to the IL-2 CD28RE requires both the CD28-induced signal together with either phorbol myristate acetate or α-CD3 (19Curtiss V.E. Smilde R. McGuire K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3567-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Unlike the IL-2 CD28RE, inducible binding of nuclear proteins to the IL-4 PRE-I and P1 elements is readily detected in nuclear extracts prepared from α-CD28-stimulated cells. 2) The CD28 signal alone cannot activate the IL-2 CD28RE (23Lai J.H. Horvath G. Subleski L. Bruder J. Ghosh P. Tan T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4260-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In contrast, IL-4 PRE-I and P1 elements may function as a "pure" CD28RE and respond to CD28 stimulation alone. 3) Although NF-κB/Rel family members make up the IL-2 CD28RE protein complex, the IL-2 CD28RE does not function independently but works only in conjunction with the adjacent proximal AP-1 binding site (20McGuire K.L. Iacobelli M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1319-1327PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that the IL-4 P1 element binds both NF-κB/Rel and AP-1 family members, although the P1 probe used does not contain an AP-1 site. This indicates that NF-κB and AP-1 proteins may interact with each other to bind together to a NF-κB-like regulatory element upon CD28 stimulation. Using reagents such as PMA and A23187 for T cell stimulation, Casolaroet al. (34Casolaro V. Georas S.N. Song Z. Zubkoff I.D. Abdulkadir S.A. Thanos D. Ono S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11623-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) found that activation of human IL-4 transcription through A23187 (the Ca2+-dependent pathway) was diminished by PMA (protein kinase C stimulation). They proposed that NF-κB (activated by PMA) may compete with NF-AT (activated by A23187) for binding to the P1 site and, consequently, inhibit the NF-AT-dependent transcription at this site. In our experiments, we stimulated Jurkat T cells through TCR by α-CD3 mAb coated at 10 μg/ml. Under these conditions, the activity of the multimerized P1 element was augmented by CD28 costimulation. Overexpression of RelA/p65 and c-Rel increased the P1-mediated transcription in CD3-stimulated Jurkat T cells. Therefore, NF-κB can activate transcription at the P1 site at physiological conditions of stimulation. However, when Jurkat cells were optimally activated by α-CD3, the P1 multimer reporter activity (but not the IL-4 promoter activity) was reduced by 10–15% when costimulated with α-CD28 mAb (data not shown). Therefore, as reported by Casolaro et al. (34Casolaro V. Georas S.N. Song Z. Zubkoff I.D. Abdulkadir S.A. Thanos D. Ono S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11623-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), NF-κB may exert a negative effect at the P1 site when transcription is maximally regulated by NF-AT. Even in this case, the IL-4 promoter activity was augmented upon CD28 costimulation indicates positive involvement of other CD28-responsive elements (such as PRE-I). Transcriptional regulation of the IL-4 gene is controlled by multiple regulatory promoter elements. Therefore, action of other, yet undefined DNA-binding factors may also be involved in the transcriptional synergy observed upon CD28 costimulation. Besides PRE-I and P1, the IL-4 promoter also contains several composite sites that bind AP-1 and NF-AT cooperatively (31Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Davydov I.V. Laur O. Klevenz S. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1380-1389PubMed Google Scholar, 45Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Krammer P.H. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 188: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Activation of T cells by α-CD28 has been shown to strongly induce AP-1 transcriptional activity via posttranslational modification (37Rincon M. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4370-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Therefore, sites involved in interaction with AP-1 may also contribute to transcriptional activation in response to CD28 signaling. Stimulation of the CD28 surface molecule has also been shown to specifically regulate the stability of messenger RNAs for IL-2, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (46Lindsten T. June C.H. Ledbetter J.A. Stella G. Thompson C.B. Science. 1989; 244: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Thus, increase of RNA stability via the CD28 pathway may be one of the mechanisms to account for the CD28 costimulation-enhanced gene production. Whether this mechanism is also involved in the synergistic effects of CD28 costimulation on the expression of the IL-4 gene needs to be investigated. We are grateful to W. Müller for supplying OKT3 and α-CD28 mAbs. We thank Dr. P. Angel for α-c-JunB mAb and Drs. K. Schulze-Osthoff and R. M. Schmid for p65 and c-Rel expression plasmids.

TITLE: Whole-Genome Sequencing and iPLEX MassARRAY Genotyping Map an EMS-Induced Mutation Affecting Cell Competition in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
ABSTRACT: Cell competition, the conditional loss of viable genotypes only when surrounded by other cells, is a phenomenon observed in certain genetic mosaic conditions. We conducted a chemical mutagenesis and screen to recover new mutations that affect cell competition between wild-type and RpS3 heterozygous cells. Mutations were identified by whole-genome sequencing, making use of software tools that greatly facilitate the distinction between newly induced mutations and other sources of apparent sequence polymorphism, thereby reducing false-positive and false-negative identification rates. In addition, we utilized iPLEX MassARRAY for genotyping recombinant chromosomes. These approaches permitted the mapping of a new mutation affecting cell competition when only a single allele existed, with a phenotype assessed only in genetic mosaics, without the benefit of complementation with existing mutations, deletions, or duplications. These techniques expand the utility of chemical mutagenesis and whole-genome sequencing for mutant identification. We discuss mutations in the Atm and Xrp1 genes identified in this screen.

TITLE: Trait values and not invasive status determine competitive outcomes between native and invasive species under varying soil nutrient availability
ABSTRACT: Invasion by exotic plants is often associated with nutrient enrichment of soils, particularly on soils of naturally low fertility. As a consequence, it is likely that the outcome of competitive interactions between native and invasive plants may be mediated by soil nutrient availability. We independently investigated competitive effect and response as well as the occurrence of asymmetric competition among native and invasive plants on soils of varying nutrient availability, using a glasshouse experiment. Seedlings of eight co-occurring pairs of invasive and native species from low fertility Hawkesbury Sandstone-derived soil were grown under low and high nutrient availability. We tested the hypotheses that native species would be competitively superior at low nutrient availability and have trait values associated with a resource conservation strategy while invasive species would be competitively superior at high nutrient availability and have trait values associated with a resource acquisition strategy. We found that nutrient availability did not mediate competitive interactions between invasive and native species. Instead, two invasive and one native species were always competitively superior irrespective of nutrient availability. Competitively superior species displayed a mixture of both resource conservation and acquisition strategies at low and high nutrient availability. In support of previous studies, we found that the a priori classification of invasive and native species does not predict competitive superiority at varying nutrient levels. Rather, species specific differences in trait values provide a competitive advantage in response to nutrient availability.

TITLE: Adherent Leukocytes Prevent Adenosine Formation and Impair Endothelial Barrier Function by Ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73-dependent Mechanism
ABSTRACT: Extracellular purines are important signaling molecules that mediate both inflammatory (ATP, ADP) and anti-inflammatory (adenosine) effects in the vasculature. The duration and magnitude of purinergic signaling is governed by a network of purine-converting ectoenzymes, and endothelial and lymphoid cells are generally characterized by counteracting ATP-inactivating and ATP-regenerating/adenosine-eliminating, phenotypes, respectively. By using cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and normal or leukemic lymphocytes as an in vitro model of leukocyte-endothelial interactions, we have identified a link between the adhesion cascade and extracellular purine turnover. Upon adhesion, lymphocytes suppress endothelial purine metabolism via (i) inhibition of ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73-mediated AMP hydrolysis, (ii) rapid deamination of the remaining adenosine, and (iii) maintenance of the sustained pericellular ATP level through continuous nucleotide release and phosphotransfer reactions. Compensation of the loss of adenosine promotes vascular barrier function (measured as a paracellular flux of 70 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran) and decreases transendothelial leukocyte migration. Together, these data show that adherent lymphocytes attempt to prevent adenosine formation in the endothelial environment that, as a consequence, may impair the vascular barrier function and facilitate the subsequent step of leukocyte transmigration into the tissue. These leukocyte adhesion-mediated shifts in the local nucleotide and nucleoside concentrations represent a previously unrecognized paracrine mechanism affecting the functional state of the targeted vascular endothelium and coordinately regulating lymphocyte trafficking between the blood and tissues.

These leukocyte adhesion-mediated shifts in the local nucleotide and nucleoside concentrations represent a previously unrecognized paracrine mechanism affecting the functional state of the targeted vascular endothelium and coordinately regulating lymphocyte trafficking between the blood and tissues. Lymphocyte trafficking between the blood and tissues is essential for the proper function of the immune system. Present hypotheses suggest a multistep model of the leukocyte extravasation, including transient lymphocyte adhesion to the endothelial lining, rolling of the cell along the endothelium, cellular activation, activation-dependent arrest, and finally, transmigration into the tissue (1Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Google Scholar). Leukocyte-endothelial interactions are dynamic, involve both cell adhesion through specific receptor-ligand pairs and bidirectional cell signaling, and are affected by soluble mediators, which can modulate adhesive molecules and signaling events in both cell types (2Panes J. Perry M. Granger D.N. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 537-550Google Scholar). The role of extracellular purines as important cell modulators has emerged relatively recently. Most models of purinergic signaling depend on functional interactions between distinct processes, including (i) release of endogenous nucleotides through channel-like pathways, secretory exocytosis, or leakage upon cell damage (3Lazarowski E.R.

Res. 2002; 91: 292-299Google Scholar); and (iii) ectoenzymatic nucleotide inactivation and interconversion (8Meghji P. Pearson J.D. Slakey L.L. Biochem.

Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 121-128Google Scholar). A number of observations raised the possibility that ATP and/or ADP regulate several inflammatory responses, including recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes to the site of injury, facilitation of leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium, platelet activation and aggregation (6Di Virgilio F.

Surprenant A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 825-835Google Scholar). Most of these effects are mediated through the G protein-coupled platelet P2Y1/P2Y12 and endothelial or lymphoid P2Y1/P2Y2 receptors, as well as via lymphoid "cytolytic" P2X7 and other P2X receptors with intrinsic pore-forming activities (6Di Virgilio F.

Endothelial E-type NTP-diphosphohydrolases (E-NTPDases, 1The abbreviations used are: E-NTPDase, E-type NTP-diphosphohydrolase; CFSE, carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; PBL, peripheral blood lymphocytes; PI-PLC, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; BCECF, bis-carboxyethyl carboxyfluorescein. otherwise known as ecto-ATPDase, CD39), in concert with ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73, represent the important effector system for maintenance of anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory state in the vasculature by rapid nucleotide inactivation via stepwise reactions ATP → ADP → AMP → adenosine (8Meghji P. Pearson J.D. Slakey L.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 725-731Google Scholar, 12Marcus A. Broekman M. Drosopoulos J. Pinsky D. Islam N. Gayle III, R. Maliszewski C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 178-182Google Scholar, 16Zimmermann H. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 987-988Google Scholar). The generated adenosine in turn has a non-redundant counteracting role in the attenuation of inflammation and protection from excessive tissue damage in vivo via interaction with its own nucleoside-selective receptors (5Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492Google Scholar, 17Sitkovsky M.V. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 493-501Google Scholar). Particularly, adenosine stimulates angiogenesis and acts as a potent cytoprotective agent (18Spychala J. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 161-173Google Scholar), maintains vascular endothelial (19Richard L.F. Dahms T.E. Webster R.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H35-H42Google Scholar, 20Lennon P.F. Taylor C.T. Stahl G.L.

Buurman W.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C522-C529Google Scholar), and suppress neutrophil function by interfering with their adherence to endothelial cells (23Cronstein B.N. J. Appl. Physiol. 1994; 76: 5-13Google Scholar). Subsequent to signal transduction, adenosine needs to be inactivated either by rapid uptake into the cells (24Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 153-181Google Scholar) or via deamination by ecto-adenosine deaminase usually associated in larger complexes with CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV (25Franco R. Valenzuela A. Lluis C. Blanco J. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 161: 27-42Google Scholar). Along with the purine-inactivating pathway, an alternative possibility of ATP resynthesis via sequential ectoadenylate kinase- and ecto-NDP kinase-mediated reactions has been recently described in our (10Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Samburski S.S. Spychala J. Jalkanen S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 121-128Google Scholar, 26Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Jalkanen S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 251-260Google Scholar) and other (3Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31061-31068Google Scholar, 27Lazarowski E.R. Homolya L. Boucher R.C.

Chem. 2003; 278: 11256-11264Google Scholar) laboratories. Given that endothelial and lymphoid cells are generally characterized by counteracting ATP-inactivating and ATP-regenerating/adenosine-removing phenotypes, respectively (10Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Samburski S.S. Spychala J. Jalkanen S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 121-128Google Scholar), these studies were designed to measure purine-converting pathways in the dynamics of leukocyte-endothelial interactions and, in this way, identify a link between the adhesion cascade and extracellular purine turnover. Isolation and Treatment of Cells—HUVEC (passages 2–3) were grown to confluence either on 24-well tissue culture plates (Greiner) or Transwell polycarbonate membranes (0.4- or 5-μm pore sizes; Costar) as described previously (26Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Jalkanen S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 251-260Google Scholar). PBL were isolated from freshly drawn donor blood using Ficoll centrifugations. The B cell lymphoma line Namalwa was from ATCC. In some experiments, the cells were preincubated with soluble apyrase from potato (grade III, 2 units/ml) or recombinant PI-PLC (0.5 units/ml) from Bacillus thuringiensis (both from Sigma), and then washed twice with RPMI 1640. The lymphocytes were also disrupted by sonication (Braun sonicator Labsonic U) and centrifuged for 10 min at 15000 × g to obtain the conventional "crude membrane" (pellet) and cytosolic fractions. The cytosolic fractions were centrifuged through microconcentrator devices (mass cut-off <1 kDa; Pall Filtron) and additionally treated with 8% Norit A (ICN Biomedicals) for elimination of endogenous nucleotides. Ectoenzymatic Interconversion of 3H-Nucleotides—Ecto-nucleotidases were assayed with [2-3H]AMP (specific activity 18.6 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) and [2,8-3H]ATP (19 Ci/mmol; Sigma) as reported previously (26Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Jalkanen S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 251-260Google Scholar). Endothelial and/or lymphoid cells were co-incubated at 37 °C under gentle orbital rotation in the following ways: (a) HUVEC monolayers were incubated 20 min with lymphocytes (or their subcellular fraction) and then either washed to remove non-adherent cells or directly challenged with 3H-nucleotides; (b) Transwell-Clear membranes (3 μm) were placed onto a plate with cultured HUVEC. Namalwa cells (1 × 106) and [3H]AMP were added to the upper and lower chambers, respectively; (c) for 5′-nucleotidase kinetics, detached HUVEC (5 × 104 cells) were incubated in RPMI 1640 containing 5 mmol/liter β-glycerophosphate, AMP (20–900 μmol/liter) with tracer [3H]AMP and other nucleotides or lymphocytes. Adenine nucleotides/nucleosides were separated by thin layer chromatography and quantified by scintillation counting (31Yegutkin G.G. Burnstock G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 227-236Google Scholar). Quantification of Extracellular ATP—Cultured HUVEC and/or Namalwa cells (1.5 × 106 per well) were incubated in 24-well plates, and extracellular ATP was quantified by luciferin-luciferase assay as described previously (26Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Jalkanen S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 251-260Google Scholar). Lymphocyte Binding to Endothelial Cells—Namalwa cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 containing 15 μg/ml biscarboxyethyl carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF) (Lambda Fluoreszenztechnologie) and 5% fetal calf serum and rinsed to remove non-bound dye. BCECF-labeled lymphocytes were incubated with HUVEC monolayers for 60 min at 37 °C under orbital rotation in the final volume of 250 μl of RPMI 1640. After intensive washing, the adherent lymphocytes were detached by using 5 mmol/liter EDTA, harvested into white non-phosphorescent microplate (Cliniplate), and quantified with a TECAN Ultra fluoropolarimeter (excitation/emission wavelengths 485/545 nm). Paracellular Permeability Assay—Using a modification of the method previously described (20Lennon P.F. Taylor C.T. Stahl G.L. Colgan S.P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1433-1443Google Scholar), HUVEC monolayers grown on polycarbonate permeable inserts (0.4-μm pore size) were placed into 24-well plates containing 0.8 ml RPMI 1640. Namalwa cells (5 × 105 per well) were added to inserts and preincubated for 20 min in the final volume of 200 μl of RPMI 1640 without or with 50 μmol/liter exogenous adenosine. The assay was started by addition of 3.5 μmol/liter FITC-dextran 70 kDa (ICN Biomedicals) to fluid within the insert, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C under orbital rotation (60 rpm). Aliquots of the assay medium from the lower chamber were transferred to the white 96-well microplate and assayed for FITC-dextran concentration (excitation, 485 nm; emission 545 nm; TECAN-Ultra). Transmigration Studies—For transmigration studies, Namalwa cells were labeled by incubation for 10 min at 37 °C with 10 μmol/liter CFSE (Molecular Probes) in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. HUVEC monolayers grown on permeable inserts (5 μm pore size) were placed into 24-well white Visiplate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) containing 0.9 ml of RPMI 1640 medium and 50 ng/ml B-lymphocyte chemoattractant (R&D Systems). The inserts were preincubated for 20 min with 100 μl of RPMI 1640 (alone or with 50 μmol/liter adenosine) prior to addition of lymphocytes. Meantime, CFSE-labeled Namalwa were also treated for 20 min in the absence or presence of adenosine (50 μmol/liter) followed by direct transfer of 100 μl of lymphocyte suspension (5 × 105 cells) to the insert with HUVEC monolayers. The plates were gently rotated for 3.5 h at 37 °C, and fluorescence in the lower chamber was directly measured by using TECAN-Ultra fluoropolarimeter (excitation, 485 nm; emission 545 nm). To correct for the nonspecific leakage of the fluorescent dye, CFSE-labeled lymphocytes were also incubated in parallel 0.4-μm Transwells, and this background fluorescence was taken into account during calculation of the number of transmigrated lymphocytes. Dot-blot and Immunoblotting Analyses—HUVEC monolayers were incubated for1hat37 °C in the absence and presence of Namalwa (1 × 106 cells) or PI-PLC (0.5 units/ml). The medium was collected, and soluble CD73 molecules were determined by dot-blot assay with anti-CD73 mAb 4G4 as described (32Airas L. Niemela J. Salmi M. Puurunen T. Smith D.J. Jalkanen S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 421-431Google Scholar). HUVEC with adherent lymphocytes were pooled from four similar wells and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. Because Namalwa-challenged HUVEC contained adherent lymphocytes, the amounts of the lysate loaded per lane were adjusted per number of endothelial cells in the wells rather than per total protein amount. Ecto-5′-nucleotidase was detected by using rabbit polyclonal antibody against human ecto-5′-nucleotidase (gift from Dr. Jozef Spychala) and normal rabbit serum (1:100) as a negative control, as described previously (10Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Samburski S.S. Spychala J. Jalkanen S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 121-128Google Scholar). Cell Surface Biotinylation—The endothelial surface proteins were biotinylated either before or after the incubation of cultured HUVEC with Namalwa cells. The cells were incubated for 40 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimido-biotin (Pierce), 0.1 mmol/liter CaCl2, and 1.0 mmol/liter MgSO4. Cells were solubilized in a lysis buffer containing 50 mmol/liter β-octyl-glucoside, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% aprotinin (all from Sigma), and the lysates were centrifuged for 40 min at 20000 × g and 4 °C. The biotin-labeled surface proteins were precipitated with immobilized monomeric avidin beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and then eluted from streptavidin pellets with the SDS sample buffer and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. Sample volumes were adjusted so that each sample was derived from an equivalent amount of starting material. Biotinylated cell-surface ecto-5′-nucleotidase was detected by using a polyclonal antibody against ecto-5′-nucleotidase as described previously (10Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Samburski S.S. Spychala J. Jalkanen S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 121-128Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—Cultured HUVEC were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with or without Namalwa (1.5 × 106 cells), washed, and stained with the following mAbs: 1E9 (gift from Dr. Linda Thompson) and 4G4, both recognizing different epitopes of CD73 but partially inhibiting its catalytic activity; 2C8 against endothelial CD31; and 3G6 against chicken T-cells (32Airas L. Niemela J. Salmi M. Puurunen T. Smith D.J. Jalkanen S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 421-431Google Scholar). For intracellular staining, HUVEC were first fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized by using 0.2% saponin. The second-stage antibody used was a FITC-conjugated anti-mouse Ig (DAKO A/S), and the slides were mounted with Fluoromount and analyzed with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX60). Data Analyses—Statistical comparisons were made using Student's t test, and p values < 0.05 were taken as significant. Ecto-5′-nucleotidase kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) were calculated by using the Michaelis-Menten equation (GraphPad Prism™, version 3.03; San Diego, CA). Lymphocytes Inhibit Endothelial Ecto-5′-nucleotidase but Not E-NTPDase—In the initial assays, ecto-5′-nucleotidase activity was assayed in cultured HUVEC and PBL suspension and defined as the rate of [3H]AMP conversion into [3H]nucleosides. Both cell types displayed significant AMP-hydrolyzing activity equal to 264 ± 31 (n = 22) and 8.3 ± 1.1 (n = 14) nmol/106 cells/hour, respectively. Surprisingly, co-incubation of HUVEC with PBL was accompanied by decrease of the joint 5′-nucleotidase activity by 18.2 ± 1.2% (n = 12; p < 0.01) as compared with the theoretical sum value of both cell types taken alone (Fig. 1A). Because understanding of the underlying inhibitory mechanisms is hampered by co-expression of ecto-5′-nucleotidase, we pretreated either endothelial or lymphoid cells with PI-PLC (0.5 units/ml), thereby causing shedding of at least 75–80% of the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored 5′-nucleotidase molecules (10Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Samburski S.S. Spychala J. Jalkanen S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 121-128Google Scholar). Addition of partially 5′-nucleotidase-depleted PBL to the HUVEC still decreased the joint AMP hydrolysis, whereas no significant inhibition was observed after PBL addition to the PLC-treated HUVEC (data not shown). Moreover, ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73-negative Namalwa B-cells (Fig. 1A) and Jurkat T-cells (data not shown) inhibited endothelial ecto-5′-nucleotidase even more efficiently as compared with PBL. Together, these data suggest that the inhibition is primarily because of leukocyte-mediated inhibition of endothelial ecto-5′-nucleotidase and that it is not restricted to a certain lymphocyte subpopulation. Use of other nucleotide substrates, [3H]ATP (Fig. 1B) and [3H]ADP (data not shown), did not reveal significant changes in the joint E-NTPDase activities during leukocyte-endothelial interaction. Role of Lymphocyte-derived Nucleotides in Endothelial Ecto-5′-nucleotidase Inhibition—For further experiments we took advantage of the ability of Namalwa cells to inhibit endothelial 5′-nucleotidase in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 2A). After lymphocyte disruption, only cytosolic extracts, but not membrane pellet, are able to inhibit endothelial enzyme, although not as efficiently as intact cells. The cytosolic fraction retained its inhibitory potency after passage through low molecular mass cut-off filters (Fig. 2A), whereas the removal of endogenous nucleotides by Norit A prevented its inhibition of endothelial 5′-nucleotidase (97.2 ± 1.9% of the control activity; n = 2). Direct bioluminescent assay confirmed the presence of relatively high ATP concentrations in Namalwa lysates (933 ± 134 pmol/106 cells, n = 11). Although these data indicate that lymphocyte-derived nucleotides may in principle act as inhibitors of endothelial 5′-nucleotidase, a distinction needs to be drawn between the inhibitory effects of lymphoid cells and their lysates. In the case of intact cells, an alternative mechanism for the nucleotide appearance could be the nonlytic release of endogenous ATP. Both HUVEC and Namalwa maintained ATP at a certain steady-state level as detected by luciferin-luciferase assay (Fig. 2B). However, because inhibition of endothelial 5′-nucleotidase is only detectable at threshold ATP/ADP concentrations of ∼10–5 mol/liter (26Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Jalkanen S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 251-260Google Scholar), it seems unlikely that nanomolar levels of the released ATP are sufficient to block [3H]AMP hydrolysis in our studies. Removal of extracellular ATP by Namalwa treatment with apyrase did not prevent their inhibitory action on endothelial 5′-nucleotidase, and, furthermore, only slight enzyme inhibition was observed when Transwell chambers with lymphocyte suspension were placed on the top of the wells with cultured HUVEC (Fig. 2C). These data suggest the involvement of other cellular mechanisms in the enzyme inhibition by intact lymphocytes. Endothelial Ecto-5′-nucleotidase Is Primarily Inhibited via Lymphocyte Adhesion—Incubation of HUVEC with Namalwa was accompanied by stable lymphocyte adhesion on the endothelial surface with prominent cluster formation (Fig. 3A). For quantitative analysis, Namalwa cells were labeled with fluorescent dye BCECF. Non-linear regression analysis revealed that lymphocyte binding to the HUVEC fits to a sigmoidal curve (Fig. 3B) with maximum binding capacity of 243 ± 29 × 103 cells per well (n = 5). This is equivalent to about four lymphocytes per one endothelial cell. Importantly, the number of adherent lymphocytes shows a highly significant correlation with their ability to inhibit endothelial 5′-nucleotidase (Fig. 3C), thus allowing us to consider the enzyme inhibition as a direct consequence of lymphocyte binding. Kinetic Evidence That Lymphocytes and Their Lysates Inhibit Endothelial 5′-nucleotidase via Different Mechanisms— Kinetic analysis of [3H]AMP hydrolysis by HUVEC was then performed in the presence of fixed amounts of lymphocytes and other nucleotides as potential ecto-5′-nucleotidase inhibitors. Inhibitor concentrations were chosen to approximate IC50 values found in preliminary competitive experiments with Namalwa cells (see Fig. 2A) and the major enzyme-inhibiting nucleotides AMPCP (α,β-methylene ADP), ADP, and ATP (26Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Jalkanen S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 251-260Google Scholar). Statistical analysis revealed a decrease of the maximal velocity (Vmax) of endothelial 5′-nucleotidase in the presence of lymphocytes (Fig. 4B) without any changes in the apparent Km values (Fig. 4A), thus indicating that these inhibitory effects are non-competitive in nature. Contrary to native lymphocytes, their cytosolic fractions primarily affected the enzyme affinity (manifested in the increased Km value), and this competitive mechanism was similar to that observed with exogenous nucleotides (Fig. 4). These data confirm the existence of two distinct and principally independent inhibitory mechanisms including 1) non-competitive inactivation of endothelial ecto-5′-nucleotidase by adherent lymphocytes and 2) leakage of endogenous NTP/NDP under cell damage and their competition with AMP for the enzyme catalytic site. Lymphocytes Switch Endothelial Purine Metabolism from Adenosine Formation to ATP Re-synthesis via Phosphotransfer Reactions—To evaluate the whole pattern of purine metabolism, HUVEC monolayers and/or Namalwa cells were incubated with 10 μmol/liter [3H]AMP; Fig. 5A depicts a representative thin layer chromatography autoradiography of its major interconversion pathways. HUVEC ecto-5′-nucleotidase efficiently converted AMP into nucleosides with adenosine being the major metabolite (lane 2). Co-incubation of Namalwa with HUVEC prevented adenosine appearance, first via inhibition of ecto-5′-nucleotidase-mediated AMP hydrolysis and second, by rapid adenosine conversion via inosine to hypoxanthine (lane 4). Inhibitor of adenosine deaminase erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine hydrochloride (EHNA) blocked further conversion of adenosine in the experiments with HUVEC, either alone (lane 3) or in combination with lymphocytes (lane 5). These findings are consistent with our recent studies showing that a significant portion of [3H]adenosine is directly inactivated by ecto-adenosine deaminase expressed on the lymphoid and, to a lesser extent, endothelial surface (10Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Samburski S.S. Spychala J. Jalkanen S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 121-128Google Scholar). Notably, the amount of radioactivity retained by lymphocytes during their incubation with HUVEC and [3H]AMP did not exceed 0.5–0.7% of total radioactivity added. This value was not affected by inhibitors of the nucleoside transport NBTI and dipyridamole (data not shown), thus allowing us to exclude possible uptake of nucleotide-derived adenosine into the cells. Although Namalwa were unable to degrade [3H]AMP, these cells were capable of converting [3H]AMP into [3H]ADP (Fig. 5A, lane 6). Further time-course analysis revealed that this [3H]AMP phosphorylation was only partially inhibited after lymphocyte pretreatment with soluble apyrase as well as during co-incubation of Namalwa cells with HUVEC (Fig. 5B). Because this backward AMP phosphorylation is mediated via ecto-adenylate kinase reaction and requires γ-phosphate-donating ATP (10Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Samburski S.S. Spychala J. Jalkanen S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 121-128Google Scholar, 26Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Jalkanen S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 251-260Google Scholar), these data may suggest that lymphocytes continuously maintain certain levels of apyrase-resistant pericellular ATP that are sufficient for activation of phosphotransfer reactions even during leukocyte-endothelial interactions. Inactivation of Endothelial Ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73 by Lymphocytes Does Not Involve Enzyme Internalization, Sequestration, or Shedding—Because ecto-5′-nucleotidase on various cell types is attributed to the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositolanchored surface antigen CD73 sharing both enzymatic and antigenic properties (32Airas L. Niemela J. Salmi M. Puurunen T. Smith D.J. Jalkanen S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 421-431Google Scholar, 33Resta R. Yamashita Y. Thompson L.F. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 161: 95-109Google Scholar), we performed immunofluorescent staining to follow the fate of the endothelial ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73 molecule; these data are summarized in Fig. 6. Cultured HUVEC show intense staining with anti-CD73 antibody 4G4 in a pattern indicative of membrane localization of this antigen (panel A), and it became relatively faint after lymphocyte binding to HUVEC (panel B). Use of another anti-CD73 mAb, 1E9, gave similar staining results (data not shown). The differences in the CD73-specific staining between control (panel C) and lymphocyte-treated (panel D) HUVEC still remained evident after permeabilization of the cells, thus excluding the possibility of endothelial ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73 internalization during lymphocyte binding.

TITLE: Resource Variation Within and Between Patches: Where Exploitation Competition, Local Adaptation, and Kin Selection Meet
ABSTRACT: In patch- or habitat-structured populations, different processes can favor adaptive polymorphism at different scales. While spatial heterogeneity can generate spatially disruptive selection favoring variation between patches, local competition can lead to locally disruptive selection promoting variation within patches. So far, almost all theory has studied these two processes in isolation. Here, we use mathematical modeling to investigate how resource variation within and between habitats influences the evolution of variation in a consumer population where individuals compete in finite patches connected by dispersal. We find that locally and spatially disruptive selection typically act in concert, favoring polymorphism under a wider range of conditions than when in isolation. But when patches are small and dispersal between them is low, kin competition inhibits the emergence of polymorphism, especially when the latter is driven by local competition for resources. We further use our model to clarify what comparisons between trait and neutral genetic differentiation (QST/FST comparisons) can tell about the nature of selection. Overall, our results help us understand the interaction between two major drivers of polymorphism: locally and spatially disruptive selection, and how this interaction is modulated by the unavoidable effects of kin selection under limited dispersal.

TITLE: Symposium on Primate Ecomorphology: introduction
ABSTRACT: This volume is the result of a joint conference for the Anatomical Society and Primate Society of Great Britain (PSGB) on Primate Ecomorphology, which was held at the University of Birmingham, UK, in December 2014. Many of the papers in this volume provide excellent introductions to the ecomorphological framework (see, for example, Elton and colleagues, and Soligo and Smaers), which I shall not attempt to compete with here; suffice to say ecomorphology is broadly the study of the association between an animal's morphology and habitat, and the behavioural responses that mediate it. While ecomorphological relationships are perhaps most richly documented in studies of the diet and locomotion of fish and lizards, the papers in this volume remind us of the many early pioneers of primate ecomorphology, such as Matt Cartmill, Bob Sussman, John Fleagle and Peter Rodman (for references, see Elton et al., and Soligo and Smears, this volume). Their work, among others, laid the foundations for this contribution, which aims to review current understanding of key topics in primate ecomorphology, and ask how modern research can overcome the challenges to understanding the ecomorphology of extant and extinct primates. The ecomorphological framework is grounded on the concept that morphology is an accurate and predictable reflection of an animal's current behaviours and ecology. In an age where technological advances have allowed the generation and analysis of datasets of unimaginable complexity, the apparent simplicity of this framework is appealing. Nevertheless, the recent growth of the field and, particularly, studies that have considered the relationship between microhabitat specialization and morphological specialization in a broad quantitative framework (Brandl et al. 2015) have revealed areas of unanticipated complexity, and shown that many ecomorphological relationships are less clear, much less linear and much more multifaceted than expected. Nowhere is this likely to be more so than in the primates. Many factors might confound the ecomorphological relationship; for example, morphology may be subject to non-functional influences on form, such as genetic drift and phylogenetic inertia, and morphological traits may not keep pace with environmental change, such that observed traits reflect past rather than current environments. For primates, however, the complexity increases. Primates are highly social, and their complex social organizations and hierarchies exert a strong influence on the way different individuals are able to exploit and interact with their habitat. Moreover, their high intelligence and high proportion of muscle to tendon means that they are highly plastic in their behaviour and morphology. Indeed, Elton and colleagues ask in their contribution, can we ever identify a primary ecological determinant of a given primate trait because compromises between different functional pressures may result in a feature being just adequate for any particular task. These issues present considerable challenges for quantifying clear patterns in the ecomorphology of extant primates, and transferring this framework to extinct taxa introduces yet another layer of complexity. All the papers in this issue of Journal of Anatomy were prepared by speakers at the Primate Ecomorphology symposium, together with their research colleagues. Most authors have taken such a holistic view of the opportunities and challenges of applying an ecomorphological framework to quantifying the dynamic interactions between both extant and extinct primates and their physical and social environments that the core themes of plasticity, sociality and interpreting the ecomorphology of extinct species run throughout the volume rather than separating contributions into topical groups. A further repercussion of the holistic nature of the papers is that I cannot possibly do justice to the wealth of information in each paper in this short introductory piece. The description that follows therefore details some of the many highlights I have found in each of the papers. I thank the authors wholeheartedly for their hard work, which has resulted in this amazing, far-reaching and stimulating volume of Journal of Anatomy. The volume begins with Sarah Elton and colleagues who, through a detailed consideration of the ecomorphological framework, pose a holistic suite of questions about the nature of the ecological signals that might be expressed in the generalized skeletons that are typical of many monkeys, how we can interpret these signals and how these factors might influence reconstructions of locomotor behaviours and habitat preferences in extinct species. This is a fascinating and detailed paper, but I was particularly struck by one of their conclusions. They point out that whilst it is heuristically useful to think in terms of ‘terrestrial’ or ‘arboreal’ in palaeobiological research, an animal faced with a predator or a tasty foodstuff is unlikely to be so prescriptive. This alludes to the important concept that we may have been overly narrow in our interpretations of the locomotor behaviour of fossil primates, which has wide-ranging ramifications for our current understanding of primate evolution. In the second paper, Erin Butler and Nate Dominy provide an excellent example of the confounding effect of primate muscular plasticity on reconstructions of the ecomorphology of extinct species. They show that the limited availability of human cadaveric material, which has forced a general assumption that minimal variation exists in human populations and/or that industrialized populations represent the human species as well as any other, has significantly hampered our understanding of early hominin locomotor efficiency. Expanding on their earlier work that demonstrated that exploitation of arboreal resources by small-bodied (pygmy) rainforest hunter-gatherers is largely facilitated by muscular adaptation, they present a more detailed interpretation of their ecomorphology. They show convincingly that despite the volume of research on humans, we still do not fully understand how human muscle–tendon architecture can be tailored to specific ecological or environmental demands. Their conclusion that the human pygmy phenotype is a promising model system for understanding hominin bipedal efficiency links to many of the other papers in the volume that argue arboreality was more important in our ancestry than has been previously thought. In the third paper, Tracy Kivell continues the plasticity theme, with a detailed and candid review of the evidence for whether the plasticity of trabecular bone can provide a strong functional signal of how a bone or joint was used during an individual's lifetime, to supplement the more limited functional information that can be gleaned from external skeletal morphology. Kivell reveals a myriad of unexpected complexities that have become apparent in making functional inferences about locomotor behaviour from variation in trabecular architecture. Nevertheless, she argues that ongoing methodological advances combined with the associated accumulation of sample sizes, and increased understanding of the relationship between ecology, biomechanics, morphology and behaviour in extant species, will mean that analyses of trabecular structure will be able to tease out functional signals in fossil bones in the near future. Anne Burrows and colleagues, in the fourth paper, accepted perhaps the greatest challenge set – to develop the case that a primate's social environment should be considered within the ecomorphogical framework. While linking broad social behaviours to specific morphologies might not always be straightforward, Burrows et al. exploit the fact that mimetic muscle morphology is directly linked to social communication as contraction of the musculature leads directly to the facial display. They present two case studies: (i) comparing gross morphology of the mimetic muscles around the external ear in Rhesus and Sulawesi macaques that are closely related but have very different methods to maintain social cohesion; and (ii) comparative physiology of the orbicularis oris muscle in humans, chimpanzees and siamangs to show the contrasting demands of facial and vocal communications. They conclude that observed morphology might reflect a compromise between the demands of the physical and social environments. This is an exciting and young field, and the authors outline several future directions of research. Clearly the next step is to demonstrate that primate adaptations to social behaviour compromise adaptations to the physical environment and result in less than optimal solutions to the latter. Christophe Soligo and Jeroen Smaers deliver a comprehensive review of current perspectives on the origin and early evolution of primates, coupled with a thought-provoking ecomorphological synthesis of primate origins. Among many other topics, these authors develop the plasticity theme with consideration of the role of the brain in buffering a species’ anatomy against natural selection. They reason that the brain determines how an individual perceives its environment, and the behaviours it uses interact with it. Thus, in the absence of direct evidence of ancestral primate behaviour, they suggest that one of the most significant new sources of information on the adaptive context and behavioural flexibility of early primates could come from application of the increasingly sophisticated comparisons possible on the brain anatomy and phylogenetic mapping of neural characteristics of extant species. In the sixth paper, Kevin Hunt delivers an incredible synthesis of the broad ecomorphology of apes and monkeys to ask ‘why are there apes?’ He brings together a detailed comparison of monkey and ape morphology, locomotion, habitat and social organization to show (among other components) that intense competition between apes and monkeys drove apes to evolve large bodies and suspensory features, and monkeys to evolve the ability to digest unripe fruits. I first referenced this paper the day after it was accepted for publication, it is an important contribution to a topic that has appeared intractable, due to limited fossil evidence. In the seventh paper, Robin Crompton reflects his delivery of the 2014 Osman Hill Memorial Lecture for the PSGB. His paper provides a personal synthesis of early hominin ecomorphology, which has been influenced by many of his own studies during 40 years of truly holistic research on hominin palaeontology, the locomotor biomechanics of extant referential models under lab and field conditions, and the development of powerful predictive-modelling computer simulations. This engaging paper details not just current understanding of early hominin ecomorphology, but also the history and societal influences on research in this field. There is a great deal of synergy in the conclusions of many of the papers in the volume, and Crompton's conclusions on selection for ecological plasticity by early hominins and the continued exploitation of arboreal resources by hominins complement and consolidate those of Elton and Dominy, Hunt and Senut. In the final fascinating paper, Brigitte Senut brings her palaeontological expertise to bear on a holistic approach to interpreting early hominin behaviour from ecomorphological signals. Through case studies of the origins of human bipedalism and the springing adaptations in fossil rodents (Pedetidae), which track the processes of desertification, she demonstrates the efficacy of an integrated approach in which locomotor reconstructions can be used to understand the environment, and knowledge of past environments can help to better reconstruct the behavioural repertoires of fossil species. She shows that to flesh out the fossil record most effectively we need ecomorphological studies not just of the descendents or models of the primates we are interested in, but of the extant species that may be models of the fossil species the primates coexisted with. A key theme in the papers in this volume is that understanding the ecomorphological relationships of extant primates is central to reconstructing the ecomorphology of extinct species. It is true that we cannot expect all fossil forms to be reflected in extant species, but the referential modelling process does not necessarily require that to be true. Of course, as Elton and Dominy show, we need to be careful in our selection of models. But by understanding how living species ‘can’ and ‘do’ interact with their habitat, ‘despite’ skeletal constraints, we can garner a better understanding of the envelope of behaviours a particular fossil species might exhibit without expression in the skeleton, and the range of ways that multiple conflicting selective pressures (from the physical and/or social environment) might be resolved in the skeleton. A living referential model need not necessarily be the whole animal, it might be a single feature or system from one or multiple living species, such as the gastrocnemius muscle–tendon unit of small-bodied rainforest hunter-gatherers, or the brain or trabecular morphology of the femur of a range of extant species. Through this holistic approach, the living world still has much to tell us about the dynamic between morphology and ecology in fossil forms.

TITLE: Selective Activation of T Cell Kinase p56 by Herpesvirus saimiri Protein Tip
ABSTRACT: Infection with Herpesvirus saimiri, a T lymphotropic virus of non-human primates, immortalizes human T cells in vitro. The cells show a mature activated phenotype and retain their antigen specificity. We have previously shown that in H. saimiri transformed cells a viral gene product termed tyrosine kinase interacting protein (Tip) associates with the T cell-specific tyrosine kinase p56lck and becomes phosphorylated by the enzyme on tyrosine residues. Here we show that p56lck is activated by recombinant and native Tip in cell-free systems. A dramatic increase of Lck activity was also observed in T cell lines transfected with Tip. p60fyn and p53/56lyn, the other Src-related kinases expressed in H. saimiri transformed T cells, did not phosphorylate Tip, and they were not activated by the protein. The selective activation of p56lck by Tip could contribute to the transformed phenotype of H. saimiri infected cells, and it might explain the T cell selectivity of the transformation event.

INTRODUCTIONCertain strains of Herpesvirus saimiri readily transform human T cells to continuous growth in cell culture(1Biesinger B. Müller-Fleckenstein I. Simmer B. Lang G. Wittmann S. Platzer E.

Remarkably, the antigen-specific response of the immortalized T cells as well as their mature and activated phenotype are very stable.

Fleckenstein B. Fleischer B. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), suggesting that the signaling apparatus of mature T cells may be required for the viral transformation. The viral genome harbors approximately 75 open reading frames. Many have been tested for transcription in transformed human cells but, so far, only ORF1 and ORF2 (7Biesinger B. Trimble J.J. Desrosiers R.C. Fleckenstein B. Virology. 1990; 176: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) encoded on a single bicistronic mRNA have been found in the permanently growing cells. We have previously shown, that the gene product of ORF1, tyrosine kinase interacting protein (Tip) is expressed in transformed cells. Tip associates with the protein tyrosine kinase p56lck and can be phosphorylated by this enzyme in vitro (8Biesinger B. Tsygankov A.Y. Fickenscher H. Emmrich F. Fleckenstein B. Bolen J.B. Bröker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). p56lckis a non-receptor tyrosine kinase of the Src family which is selectively expressed in thymocytes and mature T cells. The kinase tightly associates with the coreceptor molecules CD4 or CD8 and becomes activated after cross-linking of these receptors on the cell surface. One of the substrates of p56lck is the ζ-chain of the T cell receptor, and T cells deficient in p56lck fail to respond to T cell receptor mediated signals. This attributes a crucial role to the enzyme in the antigen-specific response of T cells(9Bolen J.B. Rowley R.B. Spana C. Tsygankov A.Y. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3403-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 10Rudd C.E. Janssen O. Cai Y.-C. da Silva A.J. Raab M. Prasad K.V.S. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 225-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The ORF2-encoded saimiri transformation-associated protein (StpC) is also expressed in H. saimiri transformed human T cells and might complement the action of Tip. StpC is a strong oncoprotein in rodent fibroblasts and epithelial cells of transgenic mice, but not in T cells(11Jung J.U. Trimble J.J. King N.W. Biesinger B. Fleckenstein B.W. Desrosiers R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7051-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 12Murphy C. Kretschmer C. Biesinger B. Beckers J. Jung J. Desrosiers R.C. Müller-Hermelink H.K. Fleckenstein B.W. Rüther U. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 221-226PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of oncogenesis by StpC is not known. Transformation of T cells probably requires the action of Tip on the T cell-specific kinase p56lckin addition to StpC. Here we further characterize this interaction and show that Tip selectively interacts with p56lck, but not with the other Src-related kinases p60fyn or p53/56lyn which are expressed in human T cells immortalized by H. saimiri. Furthermore, this interaction leads to a dramatic activation of the enzyme. This may explain why many human cell types can be infected by H. saimiri but only T cells are transformed to permanent growth.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Cell CultureThe human CD4+ T cell clones 61/39, 61/48, 68/4, and 68/5 as well as their H. saimiri immortalized derivative T cell lines 39-HVS, 48-HVS, 68/4-HVS, and 68/5-HVS have been described previously(2Bröker B.M.

Nontransformed T cell clones were cultured in complete medium (CM, RPMI 1640, 4 mML-glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 10% screened fetal bovine serum) supplemented with 100 units/ml recombinant human IL-2 (Eurocetus, Amsterdam, Netherlands) at 37°C, 5% CO2 in humidified atmosphere. They were restimulated every 14 days with 0.5 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin in the presence of irradiated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. After transformation with H. saimiri, human T cell lines were kept in 50% CG medium (Vitromex, Vilshofen, Germany) and 50% CM in the presence of 100 units/ml IL-2. Jurkat cells were derived from the original culture(13Schneider H. Schwenk H.-U. Bornkamm G. Int. J. Cancer. 1977; 19: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Raji and BJAB are Burkitt's Lymphoma lines. BWδζ, a murine thymoma line stably transfected with the murine CD3-δ-chain and the human ζ-chain(14Wegener A.M.K. Letourneur F. Hoeveler A. Brocker T.

Raji, BJAB, and BWδζ were grown in complete medium.Antisera and Monoclonal AntibodiesAntisera to the unique regions of Src-related kinases were raised by immunizing rabbits with fusion proteins containing the unique regions of murine p56lck, p60fyn, p53/56lyn, and p62c-yes and glutathione S-transferase. Antisera to the Src-kinases p55blk, p59hck, and p58fgr were generated by immunization of rabbits with synthetic peptides corresponding to the unique regions (15Li Z.-H. Mahajan S. Prendergast M.

The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY-20 was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), a rabbit antiserum to phosphotyrosine was obtained from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). Antisera against Tip were a gift of H. Fickenscher, Erlangen, Germany, and have been described(8Biesinger B. Tsygankov A.Y. Fickenscher H. Emmrich F. Fleckenstein B. Bolen J.B. Bröker B.M. J. Biol.

BNI2 reacts with β-Gal-Tip in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot sytems, and it stains a 40-kDa band in cell lines transfected with full-length Tip (see below) but not in nontransfected cells. Rabbit anti-mouse polyclonal sera were purchased from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany).ImmunoprecipitationsCells (1.5 × 107/ml in serum-free medium) were lysed in TNE buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1 mM sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), 5 mM NaF, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin (Sigma) for 20 min on ice. Lysates were cleared at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and the protein concentration in the supernatants was determined. 5 μl of antiserum/mg of protein were added for at least 1 h at 4°C to precipitate Src-related kinases. This was followed by incubation with 50 μl of a 10% (v/v) suspension of Staphylococcus aureus particles (Pansorbin, Calbiochem). In the case of murine antibodies, the S. aureus particles were preincubated with 50 μg/ml rabbit anti-mouse antibodies and washed. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times in TNE buffer. For reprecipitation after the in vitro phosphotransferase reaction (see below), the phosphotransferase reaction was stopped by boiling samples in 1% SDS, 10 mM Tris, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate. This dissociated the immune complexes. The detergent was then diluted at least 1/10 with 1% Triton, 10 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA and the solution was precleared from the remaining antibodies by incubation with 50 μl of S. aureus suspension followed by centrifugation. The supernatants were incubated with the second antibody for 1 h at 4°C and precipitated with S. aureus as described above.In Vitro Phosphotransferase AssayImmunoprecipitates were washed once in kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and 5 mM MgCl2). The pellets were then incubated for 5 min at room temperature in 25 μl of kinase assay mixture containing 1 μM ATP (Boehringer Mannheim), 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham) and 2 μg of rabbit muscle enolase (Sigma) in kinase buffer. The phosphotransferase reaction was stopped with sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5%β-mercaptoethanol). Samples were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature and microfuged. Supernatants were boiled for 5 min before separation by 8% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. For the experiments described in Fig. 4D, 0.1 μg of recombinant p56lck was incubated in 50 μl of kinase buffer in the presence of different amounts of β-Gal or β-Gal-Tip as indicated. The kinase reaction was started by the addition of 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and carried out for 5 min at room temperature. It was stopped with sample buffer, and samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR5 film. Quantitative analysis was performed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).ImmunoblotsFor immunoblotting, cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated by 8% or 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% Tween 20) followed by incubation with antisera diluted in blocking buffer. After thorough washing in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20, blots were incubated with 1 μCi/ml 125I-protein A (Amersham) in blocking buffer for at least 1 h, washed again, dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR5 film. Quantitative analysis was performed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). For the experiment described in Fig. 6B, the blot was incubated with the mouse monoclonal antibody BNI2. Bands were visualized by incubation with goat anti-mouse Ig coupled to horseradish peroxidase followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Figure 6:Tyrosine phosphorylation analysis. A, transformation by H. saimiri increases the cellular content of phosphotyrosine. Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were precipitated from 2 mg of protein of T cell lines transformed by H. saimiri, from their nontransformed parental clones and from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T cell blasts using the monoclonal antibody PY-20. For control, only PY-20 but no cell lysate was added. After separation by 12% SDS-PAGE and transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, bands containing phosphotyrosine were revealed with a polyclonal antiserum and 125I-protein A followed by autoradiography. B, Tip is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo. Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were precipitated from cell lysates (200 μg of protein) as described above (lanes 1-3) and separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. 50 μg of whole cell lysate from the same cell lines was loaded in lanes 4-6 of the same gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the blot was probed with the anti-Tip monoclonal antibody BNI2. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Tip expression in H. saimiri transformed cells (e.g. 39-HVS) regularly escaped detection by immunoblotting.

O'Rourke E. Bolen J.B. Fargnoli J. Protein Expr. Purif. 1993; 4: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For the experiment described in Fig. 4D, GST-Lck was cleaved with thrombin (ICN, Meckenheim, Germany), and uncleaved GST-Lck as well as GST were precipitated with glutathione-Agarose (Sigma). The supernatant contained p56lck.A fusion protein of amino-terminally truncated Tip and β-galactosidase as well as β-galactosidase alone were gifts of B. Biesinger, Erlangen, Germany, and have been described(8Biesinger B. Tsygankov A.Y. Fickenscher H. Emmrich F. Fleckenstein B. Bolen J.B. Bröker B.M. J. Biol.

This inserted a XhoI restriction site 5′ and a NotI restriction site 3′ of the coding regions which were used to clone the gene into the eukaryotic expression vector BCMGSNeo (gift of H. Karasuyama(17Karasuyama H. Kudo A. Melchers F. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 969-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar)). Plasmids were transfected into BWδζ cells by electroporation. One day after transfection, 1 mg/ml G418 was added to the cultures for selection. Growing cell lines were characterized by immunoprecipitation of p56lck followed by phosphotransferase assay and reprecipitation with the anti-Tip serum. A cell line expressing large amounts of Tip was cloned to obtain BWδζ-Tip.RESULTSp56lck but Not p60fyn or p53/56lyn Phosphorylate Tip in VitroAs we have shown previously, p56lck associates with the herpesviral gene product Tip in transformed T cells, and it phosphorylates the protein in vitro. We first determined whether Tip also interacts with other Src-related kinases which are expressed in the transformed T cells. For this we screened 5 human CD4+ T cell lines and 3 CD8+ T cell lines transformed by H. saimiri for the expression of Src-related protein tyrosine kinases (Lck, Fyn, Yes, Src, Lyn, Blk, Hck, and Fgr) with immunoprecipitation followed by in vitro phosphotransferase assay. They were compared with 5 nontransformed human T cell clones. As expected, in all T cell clones, basal activity of p56lck and p60fyn was measured. All transformed T cell lines additionally exhibited significant enzymatic activity of p53/56lyn, which is not commonly found in T cells. Fig. 1 shows the gain of p53/56lyn activity in the human T cell clone 39-HVS after infection with H. saimiri. We then looked for co-immunoprecipitation of Tip with p60fyn or p53/56lyn in transformed T cells. This was never observed (data not shown). However, p60fyn and p53/56lyn are present in the T cells at much lower amounts than p56lck (Fig. 1), and the level of Tip expression in transformed T cells is also very low. To increase the sensitivity of our assay, we precipitated p60fyn and p53/56lyn from the B cell lines Raji or BJAB where it is much more abundant. Furthermore, this excluded contamination of the immune complexes with p56lck. An in vitro phosphotransferase reaction was performed with recombinant Tip fused to β-galactosidase. As expected, Tip was readily bound and phosphorylated by p56lck precipitated from nontransformed human T cells or Jurkat cells. Again, p60fyn and p53/56lyn were unable to phosphorylate Tip (Fig. 2). To generate a source of native Tip, we transfected the mouse T cell line BWδζ. BWδζ-Tip expresses about 1 μg of Tip/mg of cell protein as determined by comparison with β-Gal-Tip on immunoblots (Fig. 3A and data not shown), but about 200-fold less p56lck than the human T cell line Jurkat which is representative of the other T cell lines used in our experiments (Fig. 3B). Immune complex phosphotransferase assays performed with p56lck and p60fyn immunoprecipitated directly from BWδζ-Tip again showed selective association and phosphorylation of Tip by p56lck (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Finally, we used recombinant GST-Lck, GST-Fyn, and GST-Lyn as well as Lck, Fyn, and Lyn precipitated from noninfected human T cells and B cells as above to co-immunoprecipitate Tip from BWδζ-Tip lysates which had been depleted of endogenous Lck. The results confirmed that p60fyn and p53/56lyn are not able to bind and phosphorylate H. saimiri Tip (data not shown).Figure 1:Expression of p53/56lyn in addition to p56lck and p60fyn in human T cells after infection with H. saimiri. Lysates were prepared from the nontransformed T cell clone 61/39 (A) and from the same T cell clone 6 months after transformation by H. saimiri (39-HVS, B). Src-related kinases were immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of total cell protein/sample except for p56lck where 100 μg of total cell protein was used. S. aureus particles without anti-kinase serum served as control. An in vitro kinase assay was performed, and the resulting phosphoproteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. The two gels were electrophoresed in parallel, dried, and exposed to x-ray film for 2 h to reveal autophosphorylation. Molecular mass standards are on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2:p56lck but not p60fyn or p53/56lyn specifically phosphorylates recombinant Tip in vitro. p56lck was immunoprecipitated from Jurkat cell lysates (600 μg/sample), p60fyn from Lyn-depleted lysates of BJAB cells (300 μg/sample), and p53/56lyn from lysates of Raji cells (900 μg/sample). S. aureus particles without anti-kinase antibody served as control. An immune complex kinase assay was performed without addition or in the presence of 1 μg of either the β-Gal-Tip fusion protein or of unfused β-Gal as indicated.

A, association of p40tip with Lck. p56lck was precipitated from 100 μg of protein of the transfected T cell line BWδζ-Tip (+) and from 3000 μg of protein of its mock-transfected counterpart BWδζ-neo(-). An immune complex kinase assay was performed and proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. Different amounts of total cellular protein were used for immunoprecipitation in order to achieve comparable levels of Lck autophosphorylation (lanes 1 and 2). This was necessary in order to demonstrate convincingly the absence of a 40-kDa band in the BWδζ-neo cells. The 40-kDa band in Lck immunoprecipitates from BWδζ-Tip was then identified by dissociation of the immune complexes and reprecipitation of Tip with a specific antiserum (lanes 3 and 4). Proteins in these precipitates were separated on the same gel which was dried and autoradiographed. B, expression of p56lck. Lck was immunoprecipitated from different protein amounts of BWδζ-Tip and of Jurkat cells as indicated and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. After transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, the Lck protein amount was visualized by probing with a rabbit serum directed against Lck followed by 125I-protein A. The immunoblot was then autoradiographed. PhosphorImager analysis revealed that BWδζ-Tip contained 220-fold less Lck than Jurkat cells. The positions of Lck and Tip are indicated on the left, molecular mass standards are on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Increase of p56lck Enzymatic Activity by Tipp56lck was immunoprecipitated from Jurkat cells, and the enzymatic activity was determined by a phosphotransferase assay in the presence of rabbit muscle enolase as exogenous substrate. Addition of increasing concentrations of β-Gal-Tip fusion protein augmented the enzymatic activity of Lck by a factor of 3.4 while β-Gal alone showed a negative effect if any (Fig. 4, A and B). Similarly, lysates of BWδζ-Tip depleted of endogenous p56lck enhanced the phosphorylation of enolase by Lck about 6-fold in this system, while lysates of the parent cell line did not affect Lck activity (Fig. 4C). Recombinant Lck could be used instead of the Lck immune complexes in the latter experiments with comparable results (data not shown). Neither β-Gal-Tip nor native Tip precipitated from Lck-free cell lysates ever showed kinase activity in these systems (data not shown). Roughly equal amounts of both recombinant (Fig. 4A) and cell-derived (Fig. 4C) Tip were needed to activate Lck; the amount of p40tip present in 1 mg of BWδζ-Tip cell protein (∼1 μg) is equivalent to 2 μg of β-Gal-Tip (Mr = ∼90,000). At very high Tip concentrations, phosphorylation of enolase decreased again due to substrate competition (data not shown). This precludes accurate measurement of the maximal activation of Lck by Tip. The factor of about 3-6 is, therefore, a conservative estimate of the enzymatic activation of p56lck by Tip. To exclude that activation of p56lck by viral Tip is mediated by other T cell-derived molecules which might have coprecipitated with either Lck or Tip in the experiments shown in Fig. 4, A-C, Lck was cleaved from GST-Lck by thrombin and incubated with β-Gal-Tip. Again, β-Gal-Tip but not the fusion partner β-Gal enhanced the enzymatic activity of this recombinant p56lck preparation as shown by an increase of Lck autophosphorylation (Fig. 4D). Re-evaluation of an effect of Tip on p60fyn or p53/56lyn in the presence of enolase never showed activation of these enzymes (data not shown).Enzymatic Activity of Lck is Increased in T Cells Transfected with TipMeasurement of the specific activity of Lck in BWδζ and BWδζ-Tip showed a dramatic increase in the Tip transfected cell line (Fig. 5A). BWδζ cells express extremely low quantities of Lck (Fig. 3B) precluding measurement of its activity in untransfected cells and necessitating precipitation from large protein amounts prior to detection on immunoblots (Fig. 5B). In contrast, specific activation of Lck could not be demonstrated reproducibly in H. saimiri infected T cells. Tip is expressed in very low amounts in these cells and can be detected only by the sensitive phosphotransferase assay but not on immunoblots. Any effect of Tip on Lck, which is very abundant in these cells, would be masked by the background activity of Lck which is not in complex with Tip.Figure 5:Expression of Tip increases the enzymatic activity p56lck in the murine T cell line BWδζ. p56lck was precipitated from different amounts of cell lysate from the Tip-transfected T cell line BWδζ-Tip and from its mock-transfected counterpart BWδζ-neo. For determination of enzymatic activity, immunoprecipitates were subjected to an immune complex kinase assay, and the resulting proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE (A). For measurement of protein abundance, immunoprecipitates were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with serum directed against Lck followed by 125I-protein A (B). The dried gel (A) and the immunoblot (B) were then autoradiographed. Controls without precipitating antibody are boxed. Note the large amounts of cell lysate necessary to visualize Lck from these murine cells on immunoblots. The specific activity of Lck in BWδζ-Tip is, therefore, much higher than what is usually observed in T cells. The positions of Lck, enolase, and Tip are shown on the right, molecular mass standards are on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tyrosine Phosphorylation in T Cells Expressing TipSince an increase of specific kinase activity of p56lck could not be measured in H. saimiri infected cells, we probed their basal phosphotyrosine levels as a readout for kinase activity that might not be masked by excess of inactive enzyme. Expectedly, the amount of proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine in our T cells was generally low in the absence of further stimulation. However, an increase in the level of phosphotyrosine in three bands with molecular masses of 70, 55, and 30 kDa by an average factor of 2.1, 5.3, and 2.2, respectively, were observed in T cell lines transformed by H. saimiri as compared with their nontransformed parental clones or with phytohemagglutinin-blasts (Fig. 6A). The low levels of Tip expression in T cells transformed by H. saimiri precluded detection on immunoblots (Fig. 6, A and B). Therefore, we utilized the BWδζ-Tip cell line to demonstrate phosphorylation on tyrosine residues of Tip in vivo. After immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, Tip was readily demonstrated on immunoblots from BWδζ-Tip but not from the vector control BWδζ-neo (Fig. 6B). However, the interaction of Tip with Lck was not blocked by excess of phosphotyrosine (data not shown).DISCUSSIONPreviously we have suggested that two factors cooperate in the transformation of human T cells by H. saimiri with StpC acting as the ba

TITLE: Detection of Olfactory Receptor Transcripts in Bird Testes
ABSTRACT: The sense of smell is mediated through olfactory receptors (ORs) expressed in olfactory sensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium. Interestingly, some OR genes also function in another context: they are expressed in nonolfactory testicular tissue and in sperm of mammals and fish where they mediate sperm flagellar motility. The presence of OR transcripts in testicular tissue of both mammals and fish suggests that this is a conserved trait among vertebrates. In birds, sperm competition is widespread and its outcome depends, in part, on sperm motility. Thus, avian testicular OR gene expression might be particularly interesting to study, especially in the context of current ideas on postcopulatory sexual selection. Using reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction with degenerate primers specific for OR genes and subsequent cloning, we here demonstrate that multiple OR gene transcripts are present in chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) testes. Moreover, we show that they belong to the class-γ OR gene clade. We discuss the potential significance and evolutionary implications of avian testicular OR gene expression.

TITLE: Robustness of trait connections across environmental gradients and growth forms
ABSTRACT: Abstract Aim Plant trait databases often contain traits that are correlated, but for whom direct (undirected statistical dependency) and indirect (mediated by other traits) connections may be confounded. The confounding of correlation and connection hinders our understanding of plant strategies, and how these vary among growth forms and climate zones. We identified the direct and indirect connections across plant traits relevant to competition, resource acquisition and reproductive strategies using a global database and explored whether connections within and between traits from different tissue types vary across climates and growth forms. Location Global. Major taxa studied Plants. Time period Present. Methods We used probabilistic graphical models and a database of 10 plant traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, mass‐ and area‐based leaf nitrogen and phosphorous content, leaf life span, plant height, stem specific density and seed mass) with 16,281 records to describe direct and indirect connections across woody and non‐woody plants across tropical, temperate, arid, cold and polar regions. Results Trait networks based on direct connections are sparser than those based on correlations. Land plants had high connectivity across traits within and between tissue types; leaf life span and stem specific density shared direct connections with all other traits. For both growth forms, two groups of traits form modules of more highly connected traits; one related to resource acquisition, the other to plant architecture and reproduction. Woody species had higher trait network modularity in polar compared to temperate and tropical climates, while non‐woody species did not show significant differences in modularity across climate regions. Main conclusions Plant traits are highly connected both within and across tissue types, yet traits segregate into persistent modules of traits. Variation in the modularity of trait networks suggests that trait connectivity is shaped by prevailing environmental conditions and demonstrates that plants of different growth forms use alternative strategies to cope with local conditions.

TITLE: Activation of p53-p21 Pathway in Response to Disruption of Cell-Matrix Interactions
ABSTRACT: The proliferation of most cells is strictly dependent on cell-matrix interactions, a phenomenon called anchorage dependence. Because tumor cells often are independent of this regulation, it is important to characterize the molecular pathways that control cellular proliferation after detachment of cells from their matrix. In this report, we investigated a possible role of p53 and one of its target genes, p21 waf1/cip1, as components of anchorage-dependent cell growth control. We found that p53 protein is rapidly activated upon the disruption of cellular attachment. This led to p21 transcriptional activation via two p53-binding sites in its promoter. Elevated p21 protein levels blocked transcription and activity of the cell cycle-regulator cyclin A, and cells became arrested in G1 of the cell cycle. Under the same conditions, fibroblasts from p53 knock-out mice did not activate p21 and did not down-regulate cyclin A expression but rather induced another cell cycle inhibitor, p27. Thus, our results characterize a chain of events, starting from the activation of p53 and proceeding via p21 to cyclin A, that is activated in response to the loss of cellular adherence. This p53-regulated pathway may constitute one of a few redundant systems to ensure proper cell control in multicellular organisms.

This p53-regulated pathway may constitute one of a few redundant systems to ensure proper cell control in multicellular organisms. The proliferation of normal cells, with the exception of some hematopoietic cells, is strictly dependent on cell-matrix interactions. Nonadherent mesenchymal cells fail to proliferate despite the presence of growth factors, a characteristic called anchorage dependence. In contrast, many transformed cells have lost their anchorage dependence and grow independently of cell-matrix interactions. This anchorage-independent phenotype in cell culture has been found to closely correlate with the ability of cells to form tumors in animals (1Shin S.-I. Freedman V.H. Risser R. Pollack R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4435-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The proliferation of all cells, and their progression through the cell cycle, is regulated by the sequential activity of various cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). 1The abbreviations used are: cdks, cyclin-dependent kinases; CKIs, cdk inhibitors; HEMA, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate); EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MEFs, mouse embryo fibroblasts; tk, thymidine kinase. The enzymatic activity of cdks is dependent on posttranslational modifications, as well as on physical interactions with one of the cyclin proteins that are the regulatory subunits of cdks (2Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar, 3Graña X. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of cyclins is stimulated in response to growth factor stimulation of resting (G0) cells and is required for cell cycle progression. In addition, there are two families of cdk inhibitors (CKIs) as follows: p21 waf1/cip1, p27 kip1, and p57 kip2, which bind to and inactivate most cyclin-cdk complexes, and the INK4s, which only inhibit complexes containing cdk4 and cdk6 (4Harper J.W.

An important regulator of p21 transcription is the tumor suppressor protein p53 (6Harris C.C. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1187-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 7El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T.

It is a transcription factor that binds to a specific DNA response element in the promoter of regulated genes, such as the muscle creatine kinase gene, the GADD45 gene, and theMDM-2 oncogene (8Bates S. Vousden K.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1996; 6: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 9Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Biochim. Biophys.

In the promoter of the p21 gene, two such binding sites have been identified and shown to confer transcriptional activation by p53 (11El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Waldman T. Oliner J.D. Velculescu V.E. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Healy E. Rees J.L. Hamilton S.R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2910-2919PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the p21 gene has binding sites for other transcription factors that may play a role in the regulation of p21 expression by p53-independent pathways (12Macleod K.F. Sherry N. Hannon G.

A link between cyclin expression and anchorage-dependent cell cycle progression has recently been established. In mouse and human fibroblasts, the serum-stimulated induction of cyclin A and cyclin D1 expression was dependent on cell adhesion (18Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 19Guadagno T.M. Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. Science. 1993; 262: 1572-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 20Fang F. Orend G. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In non-adherent cells, the expression of either mRNA and protein was blocked, and the cells were arrested in G1 of the cell cycle. However, the forced ectopic expression of either cyclin A or cyclin D1 cDNA resulted in anchorage-independent cell division, suggesting that both cyclins might be targets of the adhesion-dependent signals that control cell proliferation. At least part of this control might be exerted at the transcriptional level. Although one report suggested the involvement of the E2F-binding site in the cyclin A promoter (21Schulze A. Zerfass-Thome K. Berges J. Middendorp S. Jansen-Dürr P. Henglein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4632-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), another report indicated the presence of a novel CCAAT-binding protein that may mediate the adhesion-dependent transcriptional activation of cyclin A (22Krämer A. Carstens C.-P. Fahl W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6579-6582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, another part of this control was exerted posttranscriptionally. It was shown that the kinase activity of cdk-cyclin E complexes was repressed after detachment of cells (18Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar,20Fang F. Orend G. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). However, there appear to be cell type-specific differences in the control of anchorage-dependent growth, not only between normal and tumor cells but also between cell lines that are strictly anchorage-dependent. For example, in anchorage-dependent NIH3T3 cells there is no cyclin D synthesis after serum stimulation of G0-synchronized cells when the cells are detached (18Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Consequently, the retinoblastoma protein, a substrate of cdk4-cyclin D complexes, cannot become phosphorylated. Hence, retinoblastoma protein stays in its hypophosphorylated, active form and prevents cells from entering S phase. In contrast, in NRK cells, which are also anchorage-dependent, cyclin D synthesis is stimulated under the same conditions, and retinoblastoma protein becomes phosphorylated (18Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). However, the cells are still arrested in the cell cycle because they are unable to induce cyclin A expression to a level sufficient for proliferation. Together, these data also emphasize a certain redundancy in adhesion-dependent cell cycle control (18Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 19Guadagno T.M. Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K.

Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In our report, we sought to investigate molecular events that took place early after the disruption of cell-matrix interactions, and we analyzed their possible connection to later processes, such as the regulation of cyclin expression. In our studies, we found that p53 protein is rapidly activated upon the disruption of cellular attachment of logarithmically growing cells. This led to the transcriptional activation of the p21 gene via the two p53-binding sites in its promoter region. Elevated p21 protein levels blocked cyclin A transcription and activity and subsequently led to proliferation arrest in G1 of the cell cycle. In contrast, in cells lacking p53, p21 expression was not elevated, and cyclin A expression was not down-regulated; rather, in these cells another inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, p27, was induced after the disruption of cell-matrix interactions. Thus, our results characterize a cell type-specific chain of events that starts from the activation of p53, proceeds via p21, and targets cyclin A. This p53-regulated pathway may constitute one of several partially redundant systems to ensure proper cell control in multicellular organisms. HEMA (poly-HEME; poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)) was obtained from Sigma and dissolved in ethanol at 10 mg/ml. Synthetic oligonucleotides for EMSAs were provided by the Core Facility of the K. Norris Jr. Comprehensive Cancer Center. C3 10T 1/2 mouse fibroblasts were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) from p53 knock-out mice were kindly provided by Lawrence A. Donehower (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) and cultured as described above. For the disruption of cell-matrix interactions, monolayered cells were scraped off the culture dish and dispersed by pipetting. Then one-half was seeded back into a culture dish for re-attachment, and the other half was cultured in HEMA-coated plates which prevented the attachment of cells (23Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2828) Google Scholar). Most experiments were repeated with agar-coated plates (1.4% agar in complete medium) in which attachment of cells was prevented as well. Transient transfections were performed using the calcium-phosphate-DNA precipitation technique (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). The transfection mixture was added into the medium, and the cells were exposed to the precipitate for 12 h. Then the monolayer was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were scraped off the plate. One-half was put into a fresh plate, the other half was put into a HEMA-coated plate. After another 24 h the cells were harvested, and cellular lysates were prepared. After determining the protein concentration by use of the bicinchoninic assay reagent (Pierce), the luciferase activity of each lysate was determined in a luminometer. In all transfections a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase (CMV-β-gal) was included to monitor transfection efficiencies. All transfections were repeated at least three times. Luciferase reporter plasmids containing the human p21 promoter (11El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Waldman T. Oliner J.D. Velculescu V.E. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Healy E. Rees J.L. Hamilton S.R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2910-2919PubMed Google Scholar) as well as plasmid PG13 (containing 13 p53-response elements upstream of a polyoma basal promoter) (7El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8032) Google Scholar) were obtained from Wafik El-Deiry (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). To generate plasmid p21-tk, a 1.1-kilobase pair fragment containing both p53-binding sites, was excised from the p21-wt plasmid (called WWP-luc in Ref. 17Zeng Y.-X. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1557-1564PubMed Google Scholar) with HindIII andAccI. This fragment was inserted upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase (tk) promoter-luciferase reporter. The expression vector for p21 was generated by excising a 0.85-kilobase pair mouse p21 cDNA fragment from plasmid p21-9c (25Huppi K. Siwarski D. Dosik J. Michieli P. Chedid M. Reed S. Mock B. Givol D. Mushinski J.F. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3017-3020PubMed Google Scholar) with EcoRI and inserting it downstream of a cytomegalovirus promoter in plasmid pCMV-blue (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Construct cyclin A-luciferase (26Yamamoto M. Yoshida M. Ono K. Fujita T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Sakai T. Nikaido T. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was obtained from Toshio Nikaido (Shinshu University, Matsumoto, Japan). PP2A-luciferase was generated by subcloning a 1200-base pairAccI/HindIII fragment of the PP2A catalytic subunit α promoter (27Khew-Goodall Y. Mayer R.E. Maurer F. Stone S.R. Hemmings B.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) into pGL3-luc basic (Promega, Madison, WI). Total RNA was isolated using the guanidinium thiocyanate method (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (64498) Google Scholar), followed by poly(A) extraction using oligo(dT) beads (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Equal amounts of each RNA sample were separated on formaldehyde/agarose gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. For hybridization, specific riboprobes were generated using T7 RNA polymerase according to manufacturer's instructions. The hybridization was carried out essentially as described (30Schönthal A.H. Feramisco J.R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 433-441PubMed Google Scholar). After hybridization, the membranes were washed twice at 80 °C in 0.2 × SSPE and 0.5% SDS for 30 min and subsequently exposed to Kodak X-AR autoradiographic film. After exposure, the filters were stripped and rehybridized to a probe for β-actin to control for equal amounts of RNA loaded in each lane. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer as described (31Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). 20 μg of each sample was separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto nitrocellulose. After blocking with blotto (5% milk, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) for 1 h, the membrane was exposed to the primary antibody diluted in blotto at 4 °C overnight. All antibodies against cell cycle-regulatory proteins were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The secondary antibodies were coupled to horseradish peroxidase and were detected by chemiluminescence using the SuperSignalTM Substrate (Pierce). Nuclear extracts from 107 cells per point were prepared exactly as described previously (32Pfeffer K. Matsuyama T. Kündig T.M. Wakeham A. Kishihara K. Shahinian A. Wiegmann K. Ohashi P.S. Krönke M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 457-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was measured using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The binding reaction was performed by incubating 12 μg of nuclear extract with 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) and32P-labeled oligonucleotides in binding buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) in a final volume of 20 μl. The sequences for the double-stranded,in vitro synthesized oligonucleotides were as follows: p53-binding site at position −2800 of the mouse p21 promoter, 5′-GGAACATGTCTTGACATGTTC-3′; inactivated binding site, 5′-GGAATATATCTTGAATTCTTC-3′ (nucleotides that deviate from the wild type binding site are underlined). These double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, purified over a column, and used at 4 × 104 cpm per reaction. To produce supershifts, the nuclear extracts were incubated with 100 ng of mouse monoclonal antibody against p53 (PAb 421, Calbiochem) for 30 min prior to the addition of oligonucleotides (33Milner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 49-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For competition purposes, 100 ng (160-fold molar excess) of unlabeled wild type or mutant p53 oligonucleotides were included in the binding reaction. All binding reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and separated on a 5% acrylamide gel. Several previous studies that analyzed the molecular mechanisms of anchorage dependence were performed by using G0-synchronized cells (18Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 19Guadagno T.M. Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. Science. 1993; 262: 1572-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 20Fang F. Orend G. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The studies showed that these cells, after detachment, were unable to induce expression of cyclin A and cyclin D1 in response to stimulation with serum growth factors and were not able to progress through the cell cycle. In our study presented here, we used cells that were growing logarithmically,i.e. that were distributed throughout the cell cycle at the onset of detachment. In contrast to G0-synchronized cells where the expression of cyclins is shut down and cdk activity is marginal, logarithmically growing cell cultures exhibit high levels of cyclin expression and cdk activity. Our goal was to determine how this highly active cell cycle machinery was controlled after the loss of cellular adherence. 10T 1/2 murine fibroblasts were either cultured in plastic tissue culture dishes (adherent) or on top of agar or HEMA-coated dishes (non-adherent) in the continuous presence of serum growth factors. Under non-adherent conditions, the cells became growth-arrested and accumulated in G1 of the cell cycle (not shown). At the same time, the kinase activity associated with cyclin A-containing cdks was down-regulated rapidly (Fig.1). To determine the mechanisms of inhibition of cdk activity, we next analyzed the protein levels of various cdks and cyclins (Fig.2). Cyclin A protein was down-regulated and became undetectable at 36 h after the onset of detachment. Cyclin D1 was down-regulated as well but was still detectable after 48 h. There was also some decrease in cdc2 protein levels, and no decrease in cdk4 protein. Importantly, however, none of these proteins exhibited a decrease within the first 4 h (Fig. 2 B), which is the period when cyclin A-containing complexes lost most of their kinase activity. This finding indicated the effects of two regulatory mechanisms: the first one at the post-translational level which controls the enzymatic activity of the kinase (within the first few hours) and the second at the level of expression which controls the synthesis of the various kinase subunits (a later event). Because p21 waf1/cip1 and p27 kip1 are known posttranslational regulators of cdk activity, we analyzed their expression levels during the non-attached culture of cells (Fig.2 A). Whereas the amount of p27 protein did not increase during the course of the experiment, p21 protein levels increased 3-fold after detachment. Because this increase was already maximal at 4 h, we analyzed its kinetics of induction at earlier time points as well. We found that p21 expression was induced very early after detachment. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the increase in p21 protein could be detected already after 1 h and reached its maximum at 3–4 h. At these time points, there was no change in the levels of cyclin A, cyclin D1, cdc2, and cdk4 proteins (Fig. 2 B). Because cdks containing cyclin A are known targets for p21, our results suggest that the posttranslational inhibition of cdk activity after detachment of cells may be due to the increased levels of the cdk inhibitor p21. To test this directly, we investigated the amount of p21 protein in cyclin A-containing protein complexes. For this purpose, cyclin A was immunoprecipitated, and the collected complexes were analyzed for their p21 content by Western blotting. As shown in Fig.3, the amount of p21 protein associated with these complexes was greatly increased after the loss of cellular adherence. This finding directly implicated p21 as a negative posttranslational regulator of cdk activity in response to cell-matrix disruption. To determine further whether elevated levels of p21 protein may also be involved in the observed down-regulation of cyclin A expression, we investigated the mechanisms of cyclin A down-regulation. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the mRNA levels of cyclin A decline after cellular detachment and are undetectable at 24 h thereafter. This down-regulation appeared to start around 6 h, which is well after the induction of p21 protein (Fig. 2) and p21 mRNA (Fig. 4 B). This finding raised the possibility that elevated levels of p21 may result in decreased expression of cyclin A. To test this more directly, we co-transfected an expression vector containing p21 cDNA together with a luciferase reporter construct under the control of the cyclin A promoter. This co-transfection was performed in adherent cells to avoid the induction of the endogenous p21 gene (which occurs after detachment of cells). As shown in Fig. 5, elevated levels of p21 caused a decrease in cyclin A promoter activity, indicating that p21 protein is able to inhibit, directly or indirectly, transcription from the cyclin A promoter. Similarly, after detachment of cells,i.e. under conditions where the amount of endogenous p21 protein is increased, the activity of a transfected cyclin A promoter is reduced as well (not shown). As a control, we also transfected the promoter of a different gene, protein phosphatase type 2A. In this case, no down-regulation was observed neither during detachment (not shown) nor with co-transfected p21 cDNA (Fig. 5), indicating that the observed inhibitory effects on the cyclin A promoter were specific. Rather, there was a weak (1.6-fold) induction of the PP2A promoter. As PP2A has been characterized as a negative regulator of cell growth (34Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), this effect may warrant some further investigation in the future.Figure 5Cyclin A promoter activity in the presence of transfected p21 cDNA. Cells were grown attached to cell culture dishes. They were transiently co-transfected with 4 μg of cyclin A-luciferase reporter construct (cyclin A) together with 2 μg of either an expression vector for p21 (+p21, black bars) or the same expression vector without the p21 cDNA insert (−p21,white bars). As a control, p21 cDNA was also co-transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid under the regulation of the promoter for serine/threonine protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A). 24 h after transfection, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was determined. Shown is the average of 3–5 independent experiments. The luciferase activity from cells without co-transfected p21 cDNA was arbitrarily set at 100%.Error bars reflect standard deviation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results above indicated the involvement of p21 protein in the transcriptional and post-translational inhibition of cyclin A expression and activity during cellular detachment. Because this control seemed to be exerted through elevated levels of p21, and because the tumor suppressor protein p53 had been shown to be a major regulator of p21 expression, we investigated whether the increased expression of p21 during detachment was controlled by p53. Two p53-binding sites have been identified in the p21 promoter and shown to bind p53 protein (11El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Waldman T. Oliner J.D. Velculescu V.E. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Healy E. Rees J.L. Hamilton S.R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2910-2919PubMed Google Scholar). One is located at −2225 and the other at −1330 with respect to the start of transcription of the gene. We used p21 promoter deletion mutants containing either both, only one, or none of the p53-binding sites, fused to the luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 6). After transfection of these constructs, the cells were split in half and cultured either under adherent or non-adherent conditions. As shown in Fig. 6, the p21 promoter containing both p53-binding sites (construct p21-wt) was induced nearly 5-fold after detachment of cells, as compared with adherent cells. When only one p53-binding site was present (construct p21-sm) this induction was reduced to 2-fold. The construct where both p53-binding sites had been deleted (p21-dm) was not induced at all. To confirm the importance of the p53-binding sites further, we transferred the fragment of the p21 promoter, which contained the two binding sites, to a heterologous promoter, the thymidine kinase (tk) promoter. The tk promoter alone, fused to the luciferase gene (ptk), was not induced after detachment of cells. However, after insertion of the two p53-binding sites (p21-tk), this construct was induced nearly 5-fold (Fig. 6). In addition, a construct containing 13 repeats of a consensus p53-binding site (pG13) was induced 3-fold after cellular detachment. Thus, these results demonstrate that the p53-binding site is necessary and sufficient for the induction of p21 during non-adherent culture conditions. The activation of p53 was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Extracts from adherent or non-adherent cells were incubated with an oligonucleotide representing the distal p53-binding site of the p21 promoter. This sequence has been shown before to bind p53 protein (11El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Waldman T. Oliner J.D. Velculescu V.E. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Healy E. Rees J.L. Hamilton S.R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2910-2919PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig.7, there was four times more binding activity in cells that were detached, indicating elevated p53 activity. A mutated oligonucleotide with several point mutations did not compete for specific binding and did not exhibit any increased binding in detached cells. Together with the observed transcriptional activation via the p53-binding sites, these experiments demonstrate activation of p53 after detachment of cells. Our data so far indicated that disruption of cell-matrix interactions activated a chain of events that involve p53, followed by the transcriptional activation of p21, which is followed by the transcriptional and posttranslational inhibition of cyclin A. We therefore investigated next whether or not these events would take place in cells that lack functional p53 protein. We used mouse embryo f

TITLE: Family structure and entrepreneurship: Evidence from Swedish siblings
ABSTRACT: ABSTRACTFamily background matters for entrepreneurship, but why do siblings differ in their propensity to become entrepreneurs and the type of ventures they pursue? I draw on family socialization and resource allocation theories to develop hypotheses about the differential effects of family structure – comprising birth order, family size, and sibling gender – on (growth-oriented) entrepreneurship. Using firm incorporation as a marker of growth orientation, I test these hypotheses in a sample of Swedish siblings. Relative to older siblings, later born children are more likely to become unincorporated entrepreneurs, partly because they occupy family niches corresponding to lower educational attainment and higher labour market frictions. Moreover, children in very large families are less likely to pursue incorporation, with stronger effects for men and earlier born children, in line with their limited ability to develop self-efficacy due to resource dilution. Growing up with an opposite-gender sibling does not influence entrepreneurship, indicating that sibling sex composition may not foster stronger gender norms or sex-typing in this domain in Sweden. This study integrates existing findings and offers novel insights, broadening our understanding of family background in entrepreneurship.KEYWORDS: Entrepreneurshipincorporationfamily structurebirth orderfamily sizesibling sex composition AcknowledgmentsI thank the editor (Ulla Hytti), the three anonymous reviewers, audiences at Copenhagen Business School, Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition, Yale SOM, Oxford Residence Week for Entrepreneurship Scholars, SEI Doctoral Consortium, DRUID, Academy of Management, Spanish Economic Association Meeting, and Mircea Epure, April Franco, Fabian Gaessler, Orsola Garofalo, Matthew Lindquist, Joeri Sol, Mirjam van Praag, Cesare Righi, Henry Sauermann, Markus Simeth, Olav Sorenson, and Friederike Welter for helpful comments.

Birth Order, Family Size, and Sibling Sex Composition Effects in Entrepreneurship’ (SOFI Working Paper 8/2018) and ‘Intra-Family Differences in Entrepreneurship: Evidence from Swedish Siblings’.Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Supplementary materialSupplemental data for this article can be accessed online at These entrepreneurs’ family background is described based only on publicly available information. Discussions of family structure in a public forum include Wadhwa et al. (Citation2009) and Tech Crunch (Citation2012), among others.2. Lower-quality entrepreneurs use unlimited liability as an ex ante commitment not to default excessively on debt; higher-quality projects have larger future value and lower default incentives, so they enjoy limited liability, linking growth aspirations and incorporation beyond tax reasons (Edmark and Gordon Citation2013; Herranz, Krasa, and Villamil Citation2009). As riskier projects, incorporated firms are more likely to go bankrupt (Glover and Short Citation2018; Harhoff, Stahl, and Woywode Citation1998)3. Not all mismatches lead to subsistence ventures, nor are all unincorporated firms strictly due to necessity.4. Under primogeniture preference, business inheritance may favour firstborns. Children in Scandinavia become entrepreneurs in the same industry and around the time when parents exit in at most 8% of cases (Dahl and Sorenson Citation2012; Lindquist, Sol, and van Praag Citation2015; Sørensen Citation2007); 3% of U.S. nascent entrepreneurs enter via take-overs (Campbell and De Nardi Citation2009), 9% of Dutch entrepreneurs enter via family firm take-over (Parker and van Praag Citation2012), and less than 1.6% of children take over family firms in Canada and U.S (Aldrich, Renzulli, and Langton Citation1998; Fairlie and Robb Citation2007; Lentz and Laband Citation1990). Moreover, Gimenez-Jimenez et al. (Citation2021) find no difference in family firm succession intentions for firstborns relative to later born children. Inheritance is thus unlikely to explain the effects.5. For educational achievement, early descriptive evidence matches this pattern (Blake Citation1981), but recent work using instrumental variables produces ambiguous and noisy results (Åslund and Grönqvist Citation2010).6. Fletcher and Kim (Citation2018) find no differential effects for first and second born children’s personality; however, their analysis focuses on twin births only at the second and third birth order, and does not fix the rank of twin births and family size when comparing across birth orders, complicating their test. By contrast, Blake (Citation1989) provides descriptive evidence that earlier born children’s education suffers most when families become very large; Mogstad and Wiswall’s, Citation2016 recent instrumental variable estimates also match this pattern.7. By contrast, Cyron et al. (Citation2017) find positive effects of sisters on men’s cognitive ability.8. See Regeringens Proposition 2004/05:85 – Ny aktiebolagslag, page 212, available in Swedish at (accessed January 2023).9. Where appropriate, I report Kleibergen-Paap F-statistics, adjusting for the family clusters (Cameron and Miller Citation2015). Bhalotra and Clarke (Citation2019) recently show that twin births may be correlated with maternal attributes. To alleviate this concern, I control for mother’s birth year, education, and income as proxies of maternal health and later use alternative instruments based on the gender of the first two children, with similar results.10. Under son preference (Dahl and Moretti Citation2008), the family continues to have children if the first child is a daughter, but despite this selection effect on family size, the second child’s gender is orthogonal to the first child’s gender (Peter et al. Citation2018). Online Appendix A shows covariate balance for firstborn children with opposite- and same-sex next siblings; as family size differs slightly between groups, I control for it in the regressions.11. While the split sample analyses present the results transparently, some families cannot contribute identifying variation (e.g. those with two children – a boy and a girl). To maintain broad comparisons, I interact gender and birth order indicators in family fixed effects models: the results support the main conclusion (Online Appendix B).12. Including indicators for birth order is thus preferable to a linear specification, although I include the latter in Online Appendix B; note that the hypotheses do not assume or require a priori linear effects.13. Education is indeed negatively correlated with unincorporated entrepreneurship, especially for men, but has a curvilinear relationship with incorporation, increasing, then decreasing (Online Appendix A). Birth order effects in education and ability are negative and significant economically and statistically (Online Appendix B).14. Building directly on the insights in this paper, Wang et al. (Citation2022) also find that education partly explains the link from birth order to solo entrepreneurship in China, attributing remaining effects to unobserved risk taking.15. In a sample of young U.S. adults, Fletcher and Kim (Citation2018) find negative family size effects on personality traits – agreeableness, extroversion, and openness – likely correlated with self-efficacy.16. Sibling spacing is related to sibling interaction intensity (Steelman et al. Citation2002), but this family influence appears less important for entrepreneurship, regardless of gender (Vladasel et al. Citation2021; Wang, Wang, and Mu Citation2022).17.

TITLE: 37-kDa Laminin Receptor Precursor Modulates Cytotoxic Necrotizing Factor 1–mediated RhoA Activation and Bacterial Uptake
ABSTRACT: Cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) is a bacterial toxin known to activate Rho GTPases and induce host cell cytoskeleton rearrangements. The constitutive activation of Rho GTPases by CNF1 is shown to enhance bacterial uptake in epithelial cells and human brain microvascular endothelial cells. However, it is unknown how exogenous CNF1 exhibits such phenotypes in eukaryotic cells. Here, we identified 37-kDa laminin receptor precursor (LRP) as the receptor for CNF1 from screening the cDNA library of human brain microvascular endothelial cells by the yeast two-hybrid system using the N-terminal domain of CNF1 as bait. CNF1-mediated RhoA activation and bacterial uptake were inhibited by exogenous LRP or LRP antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, whereas they were increased in LRP-overexpressing cells. These findings indicate that the CNF1 interaction with LRP is the initial step required for CNF1-mediated RhoA activation and bacterial uptake in eukaryotic cells.

We have also demonstrated that E. coli invasion of HBMEC requires host cell actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and activations of RhoA (7Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Stins M.F. Shimada H. Kim K.S.

CNF1, a bacterial toxin known to induce host cell cytoskeleton rearrangements, activates Rho GTPases such as RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1 (9Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S.

The constitutive activation of Rho GTPases by CNF1 has been shown to induce stress fiber formation, membrane ruffling, and phagocytosis in epithelial cells (11Lerm M. Selzer J. Hoffmeyer A. Rapp U.R.

CNF1 is a 113-kDa single chain toxin molecule that consists of a N-terminal cell surface receptor binding domain, a C-terminal catalytic domain, and a transmembrane domain in the middle (14Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). After translocation into the cytosol, the enzymatic domain of CNF1 activates Rho GTPases by deamidation of glutamine 63 of RhoA (9Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 10Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K.

Immun. 1999; 67: 496-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The glutamine residue is essential for GTP hydrolysis, and its modification results in constitutively activated Rho GTPases by arresting the Rho GTPases cycle between the GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active forms (14Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how CNF1 enters the eukaryotic cells and activates Rho GTPases. CNF1 has been suggested to be internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis upon binding to a cell surface receptor (15Lemichez E. Flatau G. Bruzzone M. Boquet P. Gauthier M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16Contamin S. Galmiche A. Doye A. Flatau G. Benmerah A. Boquet P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1775-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), but the identity and characteristics of the CNF1 receptor are not known. In this study, for the purpose of identifying CNF1 receptor, the cDNA library of HBMEC was constructed and screened by the yeast two-hybrid system using the N terminus of CNF1 (nCNF1) as bait. We identified for the first time that 37-kDa laminin receptor precursor (LRP) functions as the receptor for CNF1. Exogenous LRP or LRP antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) inhibited CNF1-mediated RhoA activation and bacterial uptake, whereas overexpression of LRP increased binding and effects of CNF1. E. coli K1 strain E44 is a spontaneous rifampin-resistant mutant derived from the cerebrospinal fluid isolate of a neonate with meningitis, strain RS218 (serotype O18:K1:H7). The isogeniccnf1 deletion mutant of strain E44 was previously reported (8Khan N.A. Wang Y. Kim K.J. Chung J.W. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or XL1-Blue (Stratagene, Ceda Creek, TX) was used for expression of the recombinant proteins. E. coli DH10B (Invitrogen) was used for the construction of the cDNA library. Plasmids pGBKT7 and pGADT7 were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA), and used for construction of the bait CNF1 and prey cDNA libraries, respectively. Anti-LRP polyclonal antibody was purchased from Abcam (Cambridgeshire, UK). Anti-CNF1 monoclonal antibody NG8 (17Meysick K.C. Mills M. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Allison O'Brien (Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD). Plasmid pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) was used for construction of GST fusion proteins. For bait construction, the N-terminal segment of cnf1 (nCNF1) was amplified by PCR from E44 chromosomal DNA using primers, 5′-aagaattcatgggtaaccatggc-3′ and 5′-acggatccattgctaagtgtcttattgg-3′. The amplified fragments (amino acids 1–299) were cloned into pGBKT7 vector viaEcoRI and BamHI sites (underlined) to create the bait plasmid pGBKT7:nCNF1. Full-length CNF1 (fCNF1, amino acids 1–1007) and the C-terminal fragment of CNF1 (cCNF1, amino acids 720–1007) were amplified using forward primers 5′-aagaattcatgggtaaccatggc-3′ (fCNF1) and 5′-aagaattcagtatcgaaagcacc-3′ (cCNF1) and reverse primer 5′-acggatcccaataccgatatttcgg-3′ and cloned into pGBKT7 vector to construct pGBKT7:fCNF1 and pGBKT7:cCNF1, respectively, following the same strategies as described above. The cDNA library from mRNA of HBMEC was constructed with the SuperScriptTM Choice system (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol, and ligated into prey vector, pGADT7 (Clontech). pGBKT7 contains the DNA binding domain and c-myc epitope, and pGADT7 contains the activation domain and hemagglutinin epitope at the N terminus of the multicloning sites. The whole screening procedure was performed according to the MATCHMAKER protocol from Clontech using yeast strain AH109 as host. The N-terminal domain of CNF1 (nCNF1), C-terminal domain of CNF1 (cCNF1), and full-length CNF1 (fCNF1) were in vitrotranslated from pGBKT7:nCNF1, pGBKT7:cCNF1, and pGBKT7:fCNF1, respectively, using tnt quick coupled transcription/translation systems (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. pGADT7:LRP-(89–295) was used forin vitro translation of LRP-(89–295) following the same protocol. For ligand overlay assay, HBMEC membrane proteins or the bacterial lysates from E. coli BL21 containing pGADT7:LRP-(89–295) were separated in a SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. After washing, the membrane was blocked overnight with 57 skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, and incubated with in vitro translated [35S]CNF1 for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, radiolabeled CNF1 was detected with a Cyclone PhosphorImager (Packard, Boston, MA). 30 ॖg of total protein of bacterial lysates from E. coli K1 strain E44 or its isogenic cnf1 deletion mutant (E44ΔCNF1) was combined with 10 ॖl of in vitro translated [35S]LRP-(89–295), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, the mixture was precipitated with anti-CNF1 monoclonal antibody NG8 in the presence of protein A-Sepharose (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) in 0.5 ml of co-immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.17 Tween 20 (v/v), and 17 Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for overnight. After washing, immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE in duplicate. One set was dried and subjected to scan by PhosphorImager and the other was transferred to PVDF membrane, blocked, and incubated with anti-CNF1 monoclonal antibody NG8. The membrane was washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Protein detection was performed with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences). For construction of GST-LRP, full-length LRP was amplified from the HBMEC cDNA library by PCR using primers, 5′-acggatccatgtccggagcccttgat-3′ and 5′-aagaattcttaagaccagtcagtggtt-3′. For GST-CNF1, full-length CNF1 was PCR-amplified from E44 genomic DNA using primers 5′-acggatccatgggtaaccatggc-3′ and 5′-aagaattccaataccgatatttcgg-3′. Amplified fragments were cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham biosciences) via BamHI andEcoRI sites, and introduced into E. coliXL1-Blue. Expression and purification of the recombinant proteins were performed with a GST purification kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HBMECs were isolated and cultured as described previously (18Stins M.F. Gilles F. Kim K.S. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 76: 81-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Briefly, HBMECs were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 107 heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 107 Nu-Serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 ॖg/ml), essential amino acids, and vitamins. HEp-2 cells were purchased from ATCC (ATCC CCL 23), maintained and cultured according to the provider's protocol. To examine the effects of LRP in CNF1-mediated RhoA activation, RhoA-GTP assays were performed as described previously (8Khan N.A. Wang Y. Kim K.J. Chung J.W. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Briefly, HBMEC or HEp-2 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.17 SDS, 0.57 sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mmऔ-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 17 Triton X-100, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 1 ॖg/ml leupeptin, and 1 ॖg/ml pepstatin). GlutathioneS-transferase-rhotekin beads (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) were incubated with cytosolic fractions of the cells for 1 h at 4 °C by head over head rotation to collect active forms of RhoA, i.e. RhoA-GTP. After washing three times with lysis buffer, the protein complex was resolved by 127 SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. The blots were blocked with 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.17 Tween 20 containing 47 skim milk for 30 min at room temperature. After blocking, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal antibody against RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and subsequently incubated for 60 min at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody against mouse. Antibody-bound RhoA was visualized using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). A single band of RhoA in the 21-kDa range was detected. The density of RhoA-GTP bands were quantitated using an imaging densitometer. Invasion assays were performed as described previously (8Khan N.A. Wang Y. Kim K.J. Chung J.W. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Briefly, confluent HBMEC in 24-well plates were incubated with 107E. coli (multiplicity of infection of 100) in experimental medium (M199-Ham's F-12 (1:1) containing 57 heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1 mm pyruvate). Plates were incubated at 37 °C in 57 CO2 incubator for 90 min. Monolayers were washed with RPMI 1640 and extracellular bacteria were killed by 1 h incubation in experimental media containing gentamicin (100 ॖg/ml). The monolayers were washed again and lysed in 0.57 Triton X-100. The released intracellular bacteria were enumerated by plating on sheep blood agar plates. To determine the role of LRP on CNF1-induced E. coliK1 invasion, monolayers were incubated with a mixture of 3 ॖg/ml CNF1 and 30 ॖg/ml GST-LRP or GST in experimental medium for 2 h before addition of bacteria and HBMEC invasion assays were carried out as described above. Full-length LRP was amplified from the HBMEC cDNA library by PCR using primers, 5′-acggatccatgtccggagcccttgat-3′ and 5′-aagaattcttaagaccagtcagtggtt-3′, and cloned into the vector pcDNA3.1/His A (Invitrogen) via BamHI andEcoRI sites (underlined) to create pcDNA3.1:LRP. HBMEC stably transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1:LRP was seeded in 96-well plates. Upon confluence, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.057 Tween 20 and different concentrations of GST-CNF1 or no ligand in binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.057 Tween 20 and 27 bovine serum albumin) were added to each well. After 1 h incubation at room temperature, the ligand was aspirated and the cells were washed five times with binding buffer. After washing, anti-GST polyclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the cells were further incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-goat IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. To detect binding of GST-CNF1,p-nitrophenyl phosphate was added to each well and the color change was quantitated at 405 nm on a microplate spectrophotometer. Based on the human LAMR1 cDNA sequences, antisense and sense phosphorothiate oligodeoxynucleotides, respectively, were designed against nucleotides 1–20. They were antisense, ACATCAAGGGCTCCGGACAT, and sense, ATGTCCGGAGCCCTTGATGT. HBMEC were transfected with antisense and sense phosphorothiate ODNs with OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) followed by manufacturer's protocol and 48 h was allowed for HBMEC cells to uptake the ODNs. In an attempt to identify the CNF1 receptor, we screened a cDNA library of HBMEC by the yeast two-hybrid system using the N terminus of CNF1 (nCNF1) as bait. We screened more than 2 × 106 individual clones from a HBMEC cDNA library and identified nine positive clones at the highest stringency selection conditions (Trp-, Leu-, His-, Ade-). Sequence analysis revealed that one of the nine colonies contained a putative transmembrane domain, which showed a 1007 match to the partial sequence (amino acids 89–295) of LAMR1 encoding laminin receptor precursor (LRP). LRP is comprised of a cytoplasmic N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–85), and an extracellular C-terminal domain (amino acids 102–295) that are separated by a transmembrane domain (amino acids 86–101) (19Sorokin A.V. Mikhailov A.M. Kachko A.V. Protopopova E.V. Konovalova S.N. Andrianova M.E. Netesov S.V. Kornev A.N. Loktev V.B. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2000; 65: 546-553PubMed Google Scholar). This clone was further characterized for its interaction with CNF1 by retransformation. A yeast colony co-transformed with pGADT7:LRP-(89–295) and pGBKT7:nCNF1 was positive in both growth on the selection medium (Leu-, Trp-, His-, Ade-) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-औ-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) assays (Fig. 1a). Similarly, interaction between fCNF1 and LRP-(89–295) in yeast was observed (Fig.1a). In contrast, co-transformation with pGADT7:LRP-(89–295) and pGBKT7:cCNF1 or pGBKT7 vector alone did not restore growth ability or enzyme activity (Fig. 1a), suggesting that the LRP-(89–295) binds to full-length CNF1 and nCNF1, but not to cCNF1 in vivo. To validate the results obtained with the yeast two-hybrid systemin vitro, coimmunoprecipitation was performed as described under "Experimental Procedures." When the bacterial lysates containing CNF1 were mixed with in vitro translated radiolabeled LRP-(89–295) ([35S]LRP-(89–295)), LRP-(89–295) was detected in immunoprecipitates with anti-CNF1 monoclonal antibody whereas no LRP-(89–295) was detected in the absence of CNF1 (Fig. 1b). In parallel with the yeast two-hybrid screening, a [35S]CNF1 ligand overlay assay was performed to identify and confirm the cell surface receptor for CNF1. Membrane proteins of HBMEC were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the overlay assay was performed. In this experiment, a protein of 37 kDa was identified as an interacting protein with either [35S]nCNF1 or [35S]fCNF1, but no membrane protein was detected with [35S]cCNF1 (Fig.2a). To verify the specific interactions between CNF1 and the putative receptor, we performed the overlay assay after preincubation of the membrane with non-radiolabeled nCNF1, which totally blocked binding of radiolabeled nCNF1 to the membrane (Fig. 2a). Because LRP was identified as a CNF1 receptor with yeast two-hybrid screening, we speculated that this 37-kDa protein might be LRP. We next recovered the prey vector containing tagged hemagglutinin (pGADT7:LRP-(89–295)) from the yeast and introduced it into E. coli. Bacterial lysates containing HA-tagged LRP-(89–295) were subjected to [35S]nCNF1 ligand overlay assay to verify that CNF1 indeed binds to LRP-(89–295)in vitro. [35S]nCNF1 bound LRP-(89–295) when the protein was expressed (Fig. 2b, left panel,lane 2), whereas bound [35S]nCNF1 was not detected in the absence of LRP-(89–295) (Fig. 2b,left panel, lane 1). Western blot using anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody indicates that the protein detected with the [35S]CNF1 overlay assay migrates at the same molecular weight as HA-tagged LRP-(89–295) (Fig. 2b,right panel). These results taken together indicate that the extracellular domain of LRP binds to CNF1 and thus is likely to be the receptor that mediates the CNF1 biologic activity, such as RhoA activation and enhancement of bacterial uptake. We and others have previously shown that CNF1 activates RhoA in HBMEC and other eukaryotic cells such as HEp-2 cells (8Khan N.A. Wang Y. Kim K.J. Chung J.W. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 9Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P.

Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of LRP on CNF1-induced RhoA activation, HBMEC or HEp-2 cells were treated with CNF1 with or without GST-LRP, and total lysates were compared for the activated GTP-bound form of RhoA as described previously (8Khan N.A. Wang Y. Kim K.J. Chung J.W. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The amount of RhoA-GTP was quantitated from the blot using an imaging densitometer, and normalized to the values of controls where the cells were treated with only GST. CNF1, as expected, increased RhoA activation in HBMEC and HEp-2 cells by 60 and 917, respectively (Fig.3). However, when CNF1 was added in the presence of GST-LRP, the levels of RhoA activation decreased by 44 and 507, respectively, in HBMEC and HEp-2 cells when compared with CNF1-treated HBMEC or HEp-2 cells in the presence of GST. GST alone did not have any inhibitory effect on CNF1-induced RhoA activation (Fig.3). These results suggest that exogenous LRP competes with endogenous LRP for CNF1 binding, and acts as an inhibitor of RhoA activation by CNF1 in both HBMEC and HEp-2 cells. We have previously shown that CNF1 increases E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC (8Khan N.A. Wang Y. Kim K.J. Chung J.W. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We next examined whether exogenous LRP inhibited CNF1-induced enhancement of bacterial uptake. CNF1-treated cells showed an approximately 4007 increase in E. coli E44 invasion compared with non-treated cells (Fig. 4). Consistent with the results obtained from RhoA-GTP assays where GST-LRP decreased CNF1-mediated RhoA activation in response to CNF1, the enhancement of E. coli uptake into HBMEC was significantly (p < 0.05) decreased when CNF1 was co-incubated with GST-LRP compared with CNF1 alone or with GST incubation (Fig. 4). These results suggest that GST-LRP effectively inhibits E. coliinvasion by sequestering CNF1. To confirm the binding of CNF1 to LRP in HBMEC, HBMECs were stably transfected with pcDNA3.1:LRP and the binding of GST-CNF1 to HBMEC was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The binding of CNF1 to HBMEC was dose-dependent, but was markedly greater when LRP was overexpressed, compared with control vector-transfected cells (Fig. 5a). These results suggest a specific interaction between CNF1 and HBMEC via LRP, thus supporting the concept that LRP is the receptor for CNF1. In addition, CNF1-mediated bacterial uptake was significantly (p < 0.05) greater in LRP overexpressing cells (Fig. 5b). Also, CNF1-mediated RhoA activation was markedly greater in LRP-overexpressing HBMEC (Fig. 5c). Quantification of the RhoA-GTP amount with densitometry showed 427 higher activation of RhoA by CNF1 in LRP overexpressing cells than in the control cells (Fig.5c). These results support our finding that LRP acts as the CNF1 receptor, thus mediating CNF1-mediated bacterial uptake and RhoA activation in HBMEC. To confirm correlation between CNF1 effects and level of LRP expression, HBMEC were treated with LRP antisense ODNs before RhoA-GTP or invasion assays. Treatment of HBMEC with LRP antisense ODNs decreased LRP expression by 627 compared with the sense ODN-treated HBMEC (Fig.6a). CNF1 effects on RhoA activation were decreased when the expression of LRP was reduced by antisense ODN treatment, whereas sense ODN treatment did not show noticeable changes in CNF1 effects, when compared with wild type HBMEC (Fig. 6b). For example, RhoA activation by CNF1 in HBMEC was 747 decreased with LRP antisense ODNs compared with non-treated cells, whereas the effect of LRP sense ODNs was negligible (Fig.6b). CNF1-mediated bacterial uptake was also significantly (p < 0.01) decreased in LRP antisense ODN-treated HBMEC compared with sense ODN-treated HBMEC (Fig. 6b). These results taken together indicate that LRP acts as the CNF1 receptor, thus mediating CNF1-mediated bacterial uptake and RhoA activation. We have previously shown that CNF1 contributes to E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC in vitro and traversal of the blood-brain barrier in the experimental hematogenous meningitis animal model (8Khan N.A. Wang Y. Kim K.J. Chung J.W. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). CNF1 is a protein belonging to the group of dermonecrotizing toxins, produced by pathogenic E. coli (20Caprioli A. Falbo V. Roda L.G. Ruggeri F.M. Zona C. Infect. Immun. 1983; 39: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Blanco J. Blanco M. Alonso M.P. Blanco J.E. Garabal J.I. Gonzalez E.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 75: 155-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is described as AB toxins, such as diphtheria, cholera, and tetanus toxins, which are comprised of catalytic domain, cell binding domain, and membrane translocation domain (22Falnes P.O. Sandvig K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Entry of CNF1 into eukaryotic cells includes binding to a host receptor and internalization via an endocytic mechanism (16Contamin S. Galmiche A. Doye A. Flatau G. Benmerah A. Boquet P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1775-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Endocytosed CNF1 is routed to the degradative pathway, i.e. fusion with the late endosome compartment and, its catalytic activity is translocated into the cytosol in an acid-dependent manner (16Contamin S. Galmiche A. Doye A. Flatau G. Benmerah A. Boquet P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1775-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Previous competition experiments suggested the presence of the receptor for CNF1 and the specific interaction between CNF1 and the cellular receptor. For example, the activity of CNF1 was inhibited when the full-length CNF1 was co-incubated with the N-terminal domain of CNF1 while coincubation with the C-terminal domain of CNF1 had no effect on the CNF1 activity (14Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). However, the identity and characteristics of the receptor have not been determined. In the present study, we identified 37-kDa LRP as the CNF1 receptor by the yeast two-hybrid system, co-immunoprecipitation, ligand overlay, and correlating the activity of CNF1 with the expression levels of LRP. LRP has been known to be cell surface non-integrin laminin-binding protein receptors in several cell types, and involved in a variety of cellular mechanisms such as cell migration, adhesion, angiogenesis, and metastasis (23McKenna D.J. Simpson D.A. Feeney S. Gardiner T.A. Boyle C. Nelson J. Stitt A.W. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 73: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 24Vande Broek I. Vanderkerken K. De Greef C. Asosingh K. Straetmans N. Van Camp B. Van Riet I. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 85: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Donaldson E.A. McKenna D.J. McMullen C.B. Scott W.N. Stitt A.W. Nelson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 3: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). According to the previous study, the N-terminal domain of LRP (amino acids 1–85) is a cytoplasmic domain, and the C-terminal domain of LRP (amino acids 102–295) is an extracellular domain, which are separated by a transmembrane domain (amino acids 86–101) (19Sorokin A.V. Mikhailov A.M. Kachko A.V. Protopopova E.V. Konovalova S.N. Andrianova M.E. Netesov S.V. Kornev A.N. Loktev V.B. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2000; 65: 546-553PubMed Google Scholar). Because the cDNA clone identified in this study matches the extracellular domain of LRP containing the transmembrane domain (amino acids 89–295), it is likely that LRP is a receptor for CNF1. In vivo interaction between the N-terminal binding domain of CNF1 and extracellular domain of LRP was verified by cotransformation experiments where yeasts expressing LRP-(89–295) could grow on selection medium only when they are co-expressing fCNF1 or nCNF1, but not cCNF1. This finding is consistent with the previous demonstration that the receptor binding domain is located at the N terminus of CNF1 (14Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed specific interaction between LRP-(89–295) and CNF1 in vitro, and the ligand overlay assay indicated that the CNF1 binding to LRP (or host cell) is mediated by direct interaction between CNF1 containing N-terminal domain and the extracellular domain of LRP. For example, LRP-(89–295) bound to fCNF1 and nCNF1, but not to cCNF1. The interaction between LRP-(89–295) and [35S]nCNF1 was abolished by preincubation with non-labeled nCNF1, proving the specific interaction between nCNF1 and LRP-(89–295). Indeed, exogenous recombinant LRP could inhibit CNF1 activities such as RhoA activation and enhancement of bacterial uptake in HBMEC, by competing with cellular LRP in binding to CNF1. The inhibitory effect of LRP on CNF1 activation of RhoA also occurs in HEp-2 cells, where CNF1 has been shown to induce cytoskeletal rearrangements and bacterial uptake (12Fiorentini C. Arancia G. Caprioli A. Falbo V. Ruggeri F.M. Donelli G. Toxicon. 1988; 26: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13Falzano L. Fiorentini C. Donelli G. Michel E. Kocks C. Cossart P. Cabanie L. Oswald E. Boquet P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), suggesting that LRP is a receptor for CNF1 in a variety of eukaryotic cells. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments showed higher binding of CNF1 to HBMEC transfected with pcDNA3.1:LRP than control vector-transfected HBMEC, illustrating the specific interaction between CNF1 and HBMEC via LRP. The effects of CNF1 on bacterial uptake and RhoA activation were, as expected, much higher in LRP-overexpressing HBMEC, possibly because of higher binding of CNF1 to LRP. In contrast, the CNF1 effects were inhibited when the expression of LRP was decreased by antisense ODNs, showing correlation between effects of CNF1 and levels of LRP expression in host cells. LRP has also been identified as the receptor for the cellular prion protein (26Hundt C. Peyrin J.M. Haik S. Gauczynski S. Leucht C. Rieger R. Riley M.L. Deslys J.P. Dormont D. Lasmezas C.I. Weiss S.

However, this is the first demonstration that LRP acts as a cellular receptor for bacterial toxin in activation of RhoA and enhancement of bacterial uptake. Identification of receptors for bacterial toxins has been a challenge, and only a limited number of these receptors have been identified to date (31Backstrom M. Shahabi V. Johansson S. Teneberg S. Kjellberg A. Miller-Podraza H. Holmgren J. Lebens M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32Naglich J.G. Metherall J.E. Russell D.W. Eidels L. Cell. 1992; 69: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The identification of a toxin receptor is essential for elucidating structure-functional analysis of a toxin as well as understanding the pathogenesis of toxin-induced diseases. In addition, LRP has been shown to be associated with the progression of a wide variety of carcinomas. For example, the interactions between tumor cells and LRP have been shown to play an important role in tumor invasion and metastasis (33Pellegrini R. Martignone S. Menard S. Colnaghi M.I. Int. J. Cancer Suppl. 1994; 8: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 34Narumi K. Inoue A. Tanaka M. Isemura M. Shimo-Oka T. Abe T. Nukiwa T. Satoh K. Jpn. J.

Our demonstration of LRP as the receptor for CNF1 suggests that CNF1 protein or CNF1-expressing bacteria may interact with mammalian cells exhibiting higher expression of LRP, and contribute to their transformation to cancer cells. In summary, LRP was identified as the specific receptor for CNF1 by the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro ligand binding assays. Exogenous LRP competes with endogenous LRP in binding with CNF1, thus decreasing effects of CNF1, such as RhoA activation and bacterial uptake. CNF1-mediated RhoA activation and bacterial uptake were markedly increased when LRP is overexpressed and the effects of CNF1 were decreased when the expression of LRP is reduced by antisense ODN, indicating that LRP functions as the receptor for CNF1. The demonstration that the excess amount of recombinant LRP or LRP antisense ODN could not totally inhibit the effects of CNF1 on RhoA activation or bacterial uptake, however, suggests that there may be an alternative pathway for CNF1 entry into eukaryotic cells, and this issue is currently being investigated in our laboratory.

TITLE: Experimental Addition of Green Plants to the Nest Increases Testosterone Levels in Female Spotless Starlings
ABSTRACT: Multiple male traits and displays may act in signalling sexually selected processes during courtship. Spotless starling males (Sturnus unicolor) carry green plants into their nests before egg laying, and recent studies have shown that this behaviour is related to female breeding decisions and the production of male-biased broods. Although the functional implications of this effect on females are not yet clear, data suggest that it could be mediated by female circulating hormones. Additionally, females may show higher androgen levels as a consequence of the increased female‐female competition generated by the increase in male attractiveness. We tested this hypothesis using the same manipulation of green nesting material that has been previously shown to result in an increase of male attractiveness in male spotless starlings. We found that females in experimental nests increased their circulating testosterone levels during the laying period. In addition, there was an increase of social interferences in the experimental nests because of the addition of green plants. We hypothesise that testosterone may allow females to maintain their mating status when competing with other females for the preferred males. Addition of green plants also increased the variance in the levels of circulating testosterone, suggesting plasticity between females in their response to the manipulation. We propose that there is a functional link between high testosterone levels, male-biased sex ratios and female resource-holding potential in intra-sexual competition in this species.

TITLE: Targeted Disruption of the CP2 Gene, a Member of the NTF Family of Transcription Factors
ABSTRACT: The NTF-like family of transcription factors have been implicated in developmental regulation in organisms as diverse asDrosophila and man. The two mammalian members of this family, CP2 (LBP-1c/LSF) and LBP-1a (NF2d9), are highly related proteins sharing an overall amino acid identity of 72%. CP2, the best characterized of these factors, is a ubiquitously expressed 66-kDa protein that binds the regulatory regions of many diverse genes. Consequently, a role for CP2 has been proposed in globin gene expression, T-cell responses to mitogenic stimulation, and several other cellular processes. To elucidate the in vivo role of CP2, we have generated mice nullizygous for the CP2 allele. These animals were born in a normal Mendelian distribution and displayed no defects in growth, behavior, fertility, or development. Specifically, no perturbation of hematopoietic differentiation, globin gene expression, or immunological responses to T- and B-cell mitogenic stimulation was observed. RNA and protein analysis confirmed that the nullizygous mice expressed no full-length or truncated version of CP2. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with nuclear extracts from multiple tissues demonstrated loss of CP2 DNA binding activity in the −/− lines. However, a slower migrating complex that was ablated with antiserum to NF2d9, the murine homologue of LBP-1a, was observed with these extracts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that recombinant LBP-1a can bind to known CP2 consensus sites and form protein complexes with previously defined heteromeric partners of CP2. These results suggest that LBP-1a/NF2d9 may compensate for loss of CP2 expression in vivo and that further analysis of the role of the NTF family of proteins requires the targeting of the NF2d9 gene.

This is particularly evident during development where biochemical and genetic studies have identified numerous proteins essential for the processes that govern embryogenesis. Many of these factors are highly conserved in evolution, playing critical roles in organisms as diverse as Drosophilaand man. One family of transcription factors that typifies these principles is the NTF-like group of proteins. The founding member of this family is the developmentally programmed Drosophilafactor, NTF-1 (neurogenic element bindingtranscription factor) (1Bray S.J. Kafatos F.C. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1672-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). NTF-1 (also known as Grainyhead or Elf-1) was first identified through its ability to bind acis element critical for expression of the Dopa decarboxylase gene (2Dynlacht B.D. Attardi L.D. Admon A. Freeman M. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1677-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 3Attardi L.D. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1341-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Subsequently, NTF-1 was shown to bind to promoters of other developmentally regulated genes includingUltrabithorax, fushi tarazu, andengrailed (2Dynlacht B.D. Attardi L.D. Admon A. Freeman M. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1677-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). NTF-1 has also been linked to dorsal/ventral and terminal patterning through the formation of multiprotein complexes that influence transcription from the decapentaplegic andtailless genes (4Liaw G.-J. Rudolph K.M. Huang J.-D. Dubnicoff T. Courey A.J. Lengyel J.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3163-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 5Huang J.-D. Dubnicoff T. Liaw G.-J. Bai Y. Valentine S.A. Shirokawa J.M. Lengyel J.A. Courey A.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3177-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). More recently, tissue-specific isoforms of the protein have been described in Drosophila, and mutation of these isoforms or the ubiquitously expressed gene results in pupal lethality with gross developmental defects (1Bray S.J. Kafatos F.C. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1672-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 6Uv A.E. Harrison E.J. Bray S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6727-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In mammals, two highly related NTF-like genes have been identified. In humans they are known as LBP-1a and CP2 (LBP-1c/LSF), whereas the mouse homologues are referred to as NF2d9 and CP2, respectively (7Lim L.C. Swendeman S.L. Sheffery M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 828-835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Shirra M.K. Zhu Q. Huang H.-C. Pallas D. Hansen U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5076-5087Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Yoon J.-B.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The human genes are 72% identical in overall amino acid sequence but share higher sequence identity (88%) in the N-terminal halves of the proteins than the C-terminal halves (52%). The homology with the NTF gene is also in the N-terminal region with three amino acid stretches, 148 to 159, 205 to 216, and 233 to 246 showing 66, 75, and 79% identity, respectively. The NTF-like gene family has been shown to have a variety of cellular and developmental functions in human and murine cells. The best characterized member of the family, CP2, was initially identified as a factor that binds to, and stimulates transcription from, the murine γ-fibrinogen promoter and the viral SV40 major late promoter (11Kim C.H. Heath C. Bertuch A. Hansen U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6025-6029Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Chodosh L.A. Baldwin A.S. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 53: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Binding sites for CP2 have also been defined in regulatory regions of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)1 where it acts in concert with YY1 to repress transcription (9Yoon J.-B. Li G. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1776-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Wu F.K. Garcia J.A. Harrich D. Gaynor R.B.

Virol. 1997; 71: 9375-9382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the context of non-viral gene regulation, CP2 has been shown to bind homomerically to the human c-fos, ornithine decarboxylase, c-myc, and DNA polymerase promoters and the murine α-globin and fibrinogen promoters and activate transcription in vitro (17Volker J.L. Rameh L.E. Zhu Q. DeCaprio J. Hansen U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Shirra M.K. Hansen U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19260-19268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Binding to the regulatory elements in thefos and ornithine decarboxylase promoters is modulated by cell growth signals. Mitogenic stimulation of resting T-cells is associated with rapid phosphorylation of CP2 by the mitogen-activated protein kinase pp44 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1) and a consequent increase in its DNA binding activity (17Volker J.L. Rameh L.E. Zhu Q. DeCaprio J. Hansen U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This modulation suggests that CP2 contributes to the regulation of early response genes and therefore plays a role as a cell growth regulator. A developmental role for CP2 has been identified in studies of globin gene regulation. In this context, CP2 binds to the stage selector element in the proximal γ-gene promoter as a heteromeric complex with a recently cloned fetal/erythroid-specific partner protein, NF-E4 (19Jane S.M. Nienhuis A.W. Cunningham J.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). 2J. M. C. and S. M. J., submitted for publication. This complex, known as the stage selector protein (SSP), contributes to the preferential recruitment of the β-globin locus control region to the γ-promoter during fetal erythropoiesis (20Amrolia P.J. Cunningham J.M. Jane S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13593-13598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 21Jane S.M. Ney P.A. Vanin E.F. Gumucio D.L. Nienhuis A.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). SSP binding sites have also been defined in the ε-promoter and in the regions of DNase1 hypersensitivity that constitute the locus control region (19Jane S.M. Nienhuis A.W. Cunningham J.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 22Gumucio D.L. Shelton D.A. Bailey W.J. Slightom J.L. Goodman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Despite the extensive literature examining CP2 function in vitro and in cell lines, the in vivo role of this factor remains unknown. To address this, we have generated a CP2 null mutation in mice by homologous recombination. Mice lacking CP2 expression were examined for defects in growth and development, with a particular emphasis on hematopoiesis, immune, and neural function. We observed no significant abnormality in CP2−/− mice compared with wild type littermates. We have shown through DNA binding and protein-protein interaction studies that the lack of a discernible phenotype may be due to a complete rescue by NF2d9, the murine homologue of LBP1a. We isolated eight CP2 genomic clones by screening a 129-derived ES cell phage library with a full-length mouse CP2 cDNA probe. Duplicate lifts screened with a probe specific for exon two, containing the initiation ATG, identified one clone with a 12-kb insert that encodes the first two exons and the 5′ untranslated region. Detailed restriction endonuclease mapping of this fragment confirmed the previously reported genomic structure of murine CP2 with the exception of an EcoRI polymorphism detected in the 5′ untranslated region (see Fig. 1 A) (24Swendeman S.L. Spielholz C. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Sheffery M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11663-11671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, a 6.6-kbNcoI fragment containing the 5′ untranslated region and a portion of the first exon was subcloned into pSL301. AXhoI-SalI fragment containing a phosphoglycerate kinase promoter-regulated hygromycin resistance expression cassette was cloned into a downstream SalI site. Finally, a 3.4-kbSalI-NotI fragment containing 2.4 kb of the second intron of CP2 and a 1-kb HSV-TK expression cassette fragment (a kind gift of Dr. J. vanDeursen) was cloned downstream of this region to provide 3′ homology and a negative selectable marker. This construct, pK01HygTK, was linearized with NotI and transfected by electroporation into RW8 embryonic stem cells (Genomic Systems Inc). The cells were cultured on primary irradiated embryonic STO feeder cells in the presence of 140 fg/ml hygromycin and 0.2 fm FIAU. Resistant clones were screened by Southern blot analysis using a unique 0.5-kbSalI-NcoI fragment located 5′ to the targeted sequence. Four karyotypically normal CP2+/− clones were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, of which three clones were transmitted through the germ line. Embryo sections were prepared as described previously (25Zindy F. Soares H. Herzog K.H. Morgan J. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1139-1150PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, C57/BL6 mice, overdosed with ketamine and rhompin, were perfused intracardially with paraformaldehyde, and the embryos from timed matings were postfixed in a similar solution. Sections of 10–14 μm were cut with a cryostat, mounted on glass slides, and stored at −20 °C. These slides were subsequently probed with sense and antisense riboprobes generated by [33P]UTP labeling from Bluescript plasmids encoding the complete cDNAs of CP2 and NF2d9 (the latter were a kind gift of Dr. M. Negishi) (10Sueyoshi T. Kobayasi R. Nishio K. Aida K. Moore R. Wada T. Handa H. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Specific signals were developed by dipping the slides in NTB2 emulsion (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems) and exposed at 4 °C for two weeks. The sections were counterstained using 0.1% toluidine blue in distilled water and analyzed by phase-contrast microscopy. Tissues from normal and age-matched heterozygote and homozygote knockout mice were removed and fixed in formalin, and embedded paraffin sections were prepared. These sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined by light microscopy. Peripheral blood (150 μl) was obtained by retro-orbital puncture and blood cell counts, and erythrocyte parameters were determined utilizing an automated analyzer (Coulter). In addition an aliquot was stained with Wright's Giemsa or methylene blue to study hematopoietic cell morphology and reticulocytes, respectively. Bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors were cultured in methylcellulose in the presence of IL3, erythropoeitin, and stem cell factor (Terry Fox Laboratories, Vancouver, Canada). For immunological studies, single cell suspensions were prepared from spleen, lymph node, thymus, and bone marrow and stained with cell type-specific markers for granulocytes (Gr1), T-cells (CD8 and CD4), B-cells (B220 and IAb), and NK cells (NK1.1). Fluorescence analysis was performed utilizing a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Similar cellular suspensions were utilized to assess the proliferative potential of T- and B-cells, culturing 105 cells in the presence of anti-CD3ε +/− phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, concanavalin A, lipopolysaccharide, phytohemagluttinin, ionomycin, or a combination of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, phytohemagluttinin, and ionomycin for 48 h as described previously (17Volker J.L. Rameh L.E. Zhu Q. DeCaprio J. Hansen U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). RNA was prepared from various tissues and from peripheral blood and bone marrow cells using RNAzol B or RNASTAT 60. Murine CP2 and NF2d9 cDNA fragments spanning exons 2 and 3 and a portion of exon 4 were subcloned into pSP73. RPA studies were performed using the Ambion RPAII kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. For studies of murine and transgenic human globin gene expression RPA was performed utilizing probes specific for the murine ζ, α, εy, βh1, and βmajor transcripts and the human ε-, Gγ-, and β-globin transcripts (a kind gift of Dr. K. Gaensler). Crude nuclear extracts were prepared from various primary tissues (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G.

EMSAs were performed by incubating varying amounts of nuclear extract with 105 cpm of [32P]dCTP end-labeled double stranded oligonucleotides encoding the CCAAT box region of the murine α-globin promoter, the γ-fibrinogen promoter, or the SV40 major late promoter in a 20-μl reaction containing 500 ng of poly[d(I·C)], 6 mm MgCl2, 16.5 mm KCl, and 100 μg of bovine serum albumin (21Jane S.M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 18008-18017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For antibody studies, 3 μl of preimmune serum or rabbit anti-mouse CP2 antibody were preincubated for 10 min with the binding reaction prior to addition of the probe. Polyclonal antiserum against NF2d9 was kindly provided by Dr. M. Negishi. After incubation at 4 °C for 10 min and 25 °C for 20 min, samples were electrophoresed on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer for 90 min at 10 V/cm. Recombinant CP2 and NF2d9 were prepared as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins as described previously (19Jane S.M. Nienhuis A.W. Cunningham J.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). cDNA sequences encoding the C-terminal 250 amino acids (amino acids 250–500) of CP2 and the corresponding region of LBP-1a were inserted into the yeast expression vector pGBT9. The resultant plasmids encode hybrid proteins containing the DNA binding domain of GAL4 fused to CP2 or LBP-1a residues. The yeast reporter strain, HF7C, was transformed with this vector and a second plasmid encoding a hybrid protein of the GAL4 transactivation domain and either the NF-E4 cDNA or RING1B cDNA. The yeast were plated on leucine/tryptophan/histidine plates and incubated at 30 °C for 3 days (28Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4860) Google Scholar). Protein interactions are indicated by growth on these plates. Transfection efficiency was monitored by plating of an aliquot of the transformation on leucine/tryptophan plates (data not shown). CP2−/− mice were bred with mice transgenic for a single copy of a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) containing 250 kb of the human β-globin locus (β-YAC) (a kind gift of Karin Gaensler, University of California, San Francisco, CA) (29Gaensler K.M. Kitamura M. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11381-11385Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Timed pregnancies were set up utilizing CP2+/− females and CP2+/−YAC+males, where the day of plug formation was taken as 0.5 days post-coitum (E0.5 dpc). Embryos were collected on days E9.5 dpc, E10.5 dpc, E11.5 dpc, and E14.5 dpc and genotyped by standard methodologies utilizing the CP2 probes described above and a probe specific for IVSII of the human Aγ-globin gene (a kind gift of Dr. Karin Gaensler). RNA from yolk sac and fetal liver was prepared, and RPA analysis was performed as described above. To disrupt the murine CP2 gene, a targeting vector was designed that replaced the first untranslated exon and the entire second exon containing the initiation codon and the trans-activation domain with a hygromycin expression cassette (Fig. 1 A). In addition, this cassette introduced termination codons in all open reading frames. RW8 embryonic stem cells were electroporated with this construct and selected in hygromycin and FIAU. Southern analysis of resistant clones demonstrated a 9.0-kb EcoRI fragment in addition to the 10.5-kb wild type allele, at a mean frequency of one in 25 clones (data not shown). Four independently targeted clones, with normal karyotypes, were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts, three of the clones being transmitted through the germ line. Interbreeding of mice heterozygous for the CP2 allele (CP2+/−) resulted in litters of normal size with the expected Mendelian frequency of genotypes. Of 256 total offspring tested, 72 were CP2+/+(28%), 125 were CP2+/− (49%), and 60 animals (23%) were nullizygous (CP2−/−) for the CP2 allele. To confirm the loss of CP2 gene expression in nullizygous animals, RNA was prepared from various tissues of both wild type and CP2−/− mice and analyzed by RNase protection analysis. A specific band of 380 nucleotides was observed in all tissues derived from wild type animals utilizing a riboprobe that hybridizes to exons 2–4 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–5). In contrast, no signal was observed utilizing RNA derived from the brain, heart, kidney, lung, and spleen of CP2−/− mice (Fig.1 B, lanes 7–11). An actin probe controlled for the integrity of the RNA (Fig. 1 C). To confirm the loss of CP2 expression, and to rule out a cryptic splicing event that might produce a functional CP2 transcript, RNA from wild type and CP2−/− tissues was assayed by RT polymerase chain reaction utilizing primers specific to the 3′ end of the mRNA transcript. Although a CP2-specific signal was observed in all wild type tissues tested, no signal was detected from RNA derived from CP2−/− animals (data not shown). Male and female knockout mice grew normally and were healthy up to 18 months of age. No abnormal behavioral patterns were observed. The fertility of CP2−/− animals was normal, and no increase in morbidity was observed when compared with littermate controls. Careful histopathological examination of brain, spleen, kidney, liver, thymus, lymph nodes, heart, skin, muscle, and bone from CP2−/−animals, performed at 3, 9, and 15 months, was identical to wild type littermate controls (data not shown). CP2 has been implicated in the regulation of several hematopoietic genes, particularly those of the globin loci (7Lim L.C. Swendeman S.L. Sheffery M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 828-835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jane S.M. Nienhuis A.W. Cunningham J.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To determine whether loss of CP2 expression resulted in changes in hematopoiesis, the hematological parameters of CP2−/−mice were assayed and compared with those of wild type littermates. No significant difference in total cell counts, hematocrits, reticulocytes, differential white cell counts, or the α-/β-globin ratio was observed (Table I). In addition, the numbers of bone marrow progenitors, as measured by colony-forming unit activity, were similar in CP2+/+ and CP2−/− animals (data not shown). Similar studies of lymphopoiesis were stimulated by recent studies implicating CP2 in the modulation of T-cell proliferative responses (17Volker J.L. Rameh L.E. Zhu Q. DeCaprio J. Hansen U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, extensive analysis of T, B, and NK phenotypes, as well as functional assays of B- and T-cell function, failed to identify a difference between CP2+/+ and CP2−/− cells (data not shown).Table IHematological analysis of 18 CP2+/+ and 18 CP2−/− animalsParameter measuredCP2+/+ miceCP2−/− miceRCC × 109 cells/ml9.52 ± 0.209.44 ± 0.20Hematocrit48.13 ± 4.6750.83 ± 4.00Reticulocytes (%)2.63 ± 0.472.77 ± 0.63MCV52.3 ± 4.755.6 ± 5.46MCH16.49 ± 0.7316.67 ± 0.99RCC, red cell count; MCV, mean corpuscular volume; MCH, mean corpuscular hemoglobin. Open table in a new tab RCC, red cell count; MCV, mean corpuscular volume; MCH, mean corpuscular hemoglobin. It is possible that despite normal adult erythropoiesis, the loss of CP2 expression may affect either α- or β-globin gene expression during hematopoietic ontogeny. CP2 was initially identified as an α-globin CCAAT box binding activity, suggesting a possible role in α-globin gene expression. However, neither ζ- nor α-globin gene expression was perturbed in yolk sac or fetal liver cells (Fig.2 A). We have demonstrated that CP2 is a component of the γ-globin promoter-binding SSP complex and suggested that the γ to β switch in the β-globin subtype may be perturbed in a CP2 null environment. To test this hypothesis, we bred CP2−/− animals with mice transgenic for a 240-kb YAC containing the human β-globin locus (βYAC). Subsequently, we bred male progeny transgenic for the βYAC with CP2+/− females and examined the expression of both human and mouse β-globin-like genes at several developmental stages. As shown in Fig. 2 B, both human and murine β-globin-like gene expression in yolk sac, fetal liver, and bone marrow were identical in CP2+/− and CP2−/− embryos and adult mice, respectively. To examine CP2 DNA binding site occupancy in the null mice, we prepared crude nuclear extracts from lung, kidney, heart, and liver of wild type and CP2−/− animals and performed EMSA using a double stranded oligonucleotide probe containing the α-globin CCAAT box (7Lim L.C. Swendeman S.L. Sheffery M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 828-835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Utilizing equal amounts of protein in each lane, a band of similar electrophoretic mobility was observed in all wild type tissues (Fig.3 A, compare lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). In contrast, extracts from CP2−/− tissues failed to show the band seen with wild type extract and instead showed a DNA-protein complex with a slower migration pattern (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8 with 1,3, 5, and 7, respectively). This result was not dependent on the amount of protein added, as 2- to 8-fold more protein from CP2−/− liver extract incubated with the probe generated an identical band shift (Fig. 3 A, compare lane 7 with lanes 8–11). The lack of an obvious phenotype in the CP2−/− animals coupled with the persistent DNA site occupancy observed with extracts from nullizygous tissues suggested the presence of a ubiquitous CP2-like factor that could compensate for the lack of CP2. One candidate factor was Nf2d9, the murine homologue of the human NTF-like gene, LBP-1a (10Sueyoshi T. Kobayasi R. Nishio K. Aida K. Moore R. Wada T. Handa H. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Support for this hypothesis was obtained by studying the relative electrophoretic mobilities of CP2 and NF2d9. Both molecules bound the α-globin CCAAT box and γ-fibrogen probes, the NF2d9-DNA complex having a perceptibly slower mobility (Fig.3 B and data not shown). To determine whether the protein-DNA complex generated with CP2−/− extracts contained NF2d9, we performed competition experiments utilizing excess concentrations of unlabeled oligonucleotides that have been previously shown to bind CP2 and/or NF2d9(7, 10). These oligonucleotides were capable of ablating both wild type and mutant binding activity (data not shown). We also investigated the ability of monoclonal antisera generated against recombinant NF2d9 to disrupt binding activity. This antisera does not cross-react with CP2 as assessed by immunoblotting. 3A. T., J. M. C., and S. M. J., unpublished information. Addition of the antibody induced a partial supershift of wild type binding activity (Fig. 3 C, compare lanes 1 and 3). In contrast, mutant activity was completely supershifted (Fig.3 C, compare lanes 2 and 4). These data suggest that NF2d9 can maintain DNA site occupancy at CP2 binding sites. To determine whether the distribution of expression of CP2 and NF2d9 was similar, we performed in situ hybridization on embryo sections using antisense and sense probes specific for each mRNA transcript. Normal embryos were examined at E9.5, E11.5, and E13.5 dpc. Probes were of similar specific activity, and sense probes produced little background signal from embryos probed at all developmental stages (Fig. 4, A andC). However, utilizing an antisense probe, we observed CP2 expression in most tissues at similar levels at E13.5 dpc (Fig.4 B). In contrast, although expression of NF2d9 was observed in all tissues, it was markedly higher in the fetal liver (Fig.4 D, arrow). It is possible that loss of CP2 expression results in up-regulation of NF2d9 expression. To test this hypothesis, we determined the expression of NF2d9 in the brain, kidney, and heart of CP2+/+ and CP2 null animals. As shown in Fig. 4 E, no significant change in the relative expression of NF2d9 was observed in any of these tissues when compared with the actin control. The DNA binding, transactivation, and expression patterns of LBP-1a/NF2d9 suggested that this protein could potentially compensate for the loss of CP2. To evaluate this further, we examined whether LBP-1a could fulfill the protein-protein interaction role of CP2. We have recently defined two transcription factors that specifically interact with CP2. 4S. M. J. and J. M. C., submitted for publication.

TITLE: Interdomain Interaction in the FimH Adhesin of Escherichia coli Regulates the Affinity to Mannose
ABSTRACT: FimH is a mannose-specific adhesin located on the tip of type 1 fimbriae of Escherichia coli that is capable of mediating shear-enhanced bacterial adhesion. FimH consists of a fimbria-associated pilin domain and a mannose-binding lectin domain, with the binding pocket positioned opposite the interdomain interface. By using the yeast two-hybrid system, purified lectin and pilin domains, and docking simulations, we show here that the FimH domains interact with one another. The affinity for mannose is greatly enhanced (up to 300-fold) in FimH variants in which the interdomain interaction is disrupted by structural mutations in either the pilin or lectin domains. Also, affinity to mannose is dramatically enhanced in isolated lectin domains or in FimH complexed with the chaperone molecule that is wedged between the domains. Furthermore, FimH with native structure mediates weak binding at low shear stress but shifts to strong binding at high shear, whereas FimH with disrupted interdomain contacts (or the isolated lectin domain) mediates strong binding to mannose-coated surfaces even under low shear. We propose that interactions between lectin and pilin domains decrease the affinity of the mannose-binding pocket via an allosteric mechanism. We further suggest that mechanical force at high shear stress separates the two domains, allowing the lectin domain to switch from a low affinity to a high affinity state. This shift provides a mechanism for FimH-mediated shear-enhanced adhesion by enabling the adhesin to form catch bond-like interactions that are longer lived at high tensile force. FimH is a mannose-specific adhesin located on the tip of type 1 fimbriae of Escherichia coli that is capable of mediating shear-enhanced bacterial adhesion. FimH consists of a fimbria-associated pilin domain and a mannose-binding lectin domain, with the binding pocket positioned opposite the interdomain interface. By using the yeast two-hybrid system, purified lectin and pilin domains, and docking simulations, we show here that the FimH domains interact with one another. The affinity for mannose is greatly enhanced (up to 300-fold) in FimH variants in which the interdomain interaction is disrupted by structural mutations in either the pilin or lectin domains.

We propose that interactions between lectin and pilin domains decrease the affinity of the mannose-binding pocket via an allosteric mechanism. We further suggest that mechanical force at high shear stress separates the two domains, allowing the lectin domain to switch from a low affinity to a high affinity state. This shift provides a mechanism for FimH-mediated shear-enhanced adhesion by enabling the adhesin to form catch bond-like interactions that are longer lived at high tensile force. Receptor-ligand specific adhesion is among the most fundamental of biological phenomena in nature. This phenomenon underlies eukaryotic cell-cell or cell-surface attachment, initiates recognition and signaling events, binds bacteria or viruses to target cells, and mediates biofilm formation on medical implants. Usually, the adhesion is mediated by protein-protein, protein-lipid, or often, protein-saccharide interactions (1Deller M.C. Yvonne Jones E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Most of these adhesive interactions occur under a certain level of tensile force that arises from shear stress. Whereas a number of receptor-ligand binding interactions are weakened by tensile force, recent studies have shown that certain physiologically important biomolecular interactions can be enhanced by mechanical force (2Isberg R.R. Barnes P. Cell. 2002; 110: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3Konstantopoulos K. Hanley W.D. Wirtz D. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13 (-R613): R611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Zhu C. McEver R.P. Mol. Cell Biomech. 2005; 2: 91-104PubMed Google Scholar). Although these studies have exposed a novel, so-called catch bond, mode of receptor-ligand adhesion, the precise structural mechanism for it remains elusive. One type of receptor-ligand interaction that is enhanced by mechanical force is that of the most common family of bacterial adhesins, mannose-specific type 1 fimbriae. In Escherichia coli, mannose-specific adhesion is mediated by the FimH adhesin at the tip of type 1 fimbriae. FimH has two domains, the mannose-binding lectin domain (Ld) 4The abbreviations used are: Ld, lectin domain; Pd, pilin domain; aa, amino acid(s); 1M, monomannose; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MD, molecular dynamics. (1–156 aa) and the fimbria-incorporating pilin domain (Pd) (160–273 aa), which are connected via a 3-aa interdomain linker peptide chain (5Choudhury D. Thompson A. Stojanoff V. Langermann S. Pinkner J. Hultgren S.J. Knight S.D. Science. 1999; 285: 1061-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The Ld is a β-barrel fold with the monomannose (1M)-binding site located at its distal end, opposite from the interface between the Ld and Pd. We have shown that shear stress enhances FimH-mediated binding of E. coli to both eukaryotic cells and 1M-coated surfaces. This enhanced binding results in increased bacterial accumulation and adhesion strength on the mannosylated surface under increased flow conditions (6Thomas W.E. Nilsson L. Forero M. Sokurenko E.V. Vogel V. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 7Thomas W.E. Trintchina E. Forero M. Vogel V. Sokurenko E.V. Cell. 2002; 109: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring mutations within FimH (that are predominantly found in uropathogenic E. coli) have been shown to increase adhesion to a 1M-surface up to 15-fold under static or low shear conditions (8Sokurenko E.V. Chesnokova V. Doyle R.J. Hasty D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17880-17886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Whereas many of the mutations are located in various regions of the Ld, some are found in the Pd, with majority of all mutations located around the interdomain interface. The shear-enhanced adhesion of FimH is reminiscent of shear-dependent rolling of leukocytes on the endothelium surface mediated by the interaction between P- and L-selectin protein and Lewis X antigen oligosaccharides (9Finger E.B. Puri K.D. Alon R. Lawrence M.B. von Andrian U.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The FimH and P- and L-selectin-mediated binding have been suggested to occur via a catch bond mechanism (2Isberg R.R. Barnes P.

This mechanism differs from a slip bond of traditional interactions that are inhibited by force. Despite data that show longer interaction lifetimes with increasing force (10Thomas W.E. Forero M.

A. 2004; 101: 11281-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), the existence of catch bonds remains controversial due to limited experimental evidence that would provide a structural basis for how mechanical force regulates protein-ligand interaction. Here we show that the fimbriae-anchoring Pd could play a direct role in modulating the activity of the mannose-binding Ld. This modulation occurs through interdomain interactions that keep the Ld in the 1M weak-binding state. This state can switch to a 1M strong-binding state when the Ld is separated from Pd. Thus, the interdomain regulation we report here provides a mechanism for switching from weak to strong binding under high shear stress.

Bacterial Binding—Static assays of bacterial adhesion to immobilized 1M/ligands (1M/BSA or yeast mannan) were carried out in 96-well plates as described previously (15Sokurenko E.V.

Binding under shear stress were performed using parallel plate flow chambers as described in Ref. 7Thomas W.E. Trintchina E. Forero M. Vogel V. Sokurenko E.V.

Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed in general as described previously (16Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). In brief, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40 with the yeast his3 gene as a reporter that, when properly expressed, enables yeast growth on medium lacking histidine. Expression of his3 in L40 is driven by the minimal his3 promoter fused to multimerized binding sites for the DNA-binding protein LexA. Gene regions encoding for Ld of different variants of FimH were cloned to create in-frame fusion with the LexA DNA-binding domain, whereas different variants of Pd (with self-complementing β-strand) were cloned to create in-frame fusion with the activation domain of transcriptional activator VP16. Both expression vectors, carrying LexA-Ld and VP16-Pd fusions, were transformed into strain L40 and productive interaction between Ld and Pd were detected by the ability of transformants to grow on plates of minimal YNB media lacking histidine with and without 3-aminotriazole inhibitor of the his3 protein. Interdomain Docking—Docking predictions were performed using the docking mode of the Rosetta program (17Gray J.J. Moughon S. Wang C. Schueler-Furman O. Kuhlman B. Rohl C.A. Baker D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). The sequences of the Ld and Pd from the FimH variant of the starting crystal structure were identical to the FimHK12 variant used in these studies. To isolate the two domains for the docking predictions, the linker chain residues (Pro157–Gly159) and the FimC chaperone molecule were computationally removed from the x-ray structure of FimH (Protein Data Bank code 1klf (18Hung C.S. Bouckaert J. Hung D. Pinkner J. Widberg C. DeFusco A. Auguste C.G. Strouse R. Langermann S. Waksman G. Hultgren S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar)). The domains were allowed to move freely relatively to each other in the predictions, although there was a distance constraint of 13.0 Å between the C-terminal residue of the Ld and N-terminal residue of Pd to ensure the linker chain connection in the docked structure. A total of 5,000 models were generated followed by clustering of the top 200 scoring models (17Gray J.J. Moughon S. Wang C. Schueler-Furman O. Kuhlman B. Rohl C.A. Baker D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar) and five models were selected based on their relative score rank among all models. However, two of the top-scoring models presented severe conformational constrains that would have prevented repositioning the linker chain between the domains, whereas another model created overlaps between the Ld and groove into which the β-strand of the FimC chaperone and, in native fimbriae, the FimG subunit is being incorporated. The remaining two models were identical within 0.9 Å and included the highest scoring model. The highest scoring model was selected from the five models and the interdomain linker was successfully rebuilt in the selected model using the loop mode of the Rosetta program (19Rohl C.A. Strauss C.E. Misura K.M. Baker D. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 383: 66-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). Steered Molecular Dynamics—Domain-domain interactions were examined using molecular dynamics (MD) and steered molecular dynamics simulations. All simulations were performed using NAMD 2.5, which was developed by the Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group in the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (20Kale L.

To set up the simulations, α-d-mannose and crystal waters were aligned to the docked structure based on the x-ray crystal structure (18Hung C.S. Bouckaert J. Hung D. Pinkner J. Widberg C. DeFusco A. Auguste C.G. Strouse R. Langermann S. Waksman G. Hultgren S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The Pd from the docked structure was aligned to the Pd from the crystal structure (PDB code 1klf (18Hung C.S. Bouckaert J. Hung D. Pinkner J. Widberg C. DeFusco A. Auguste C.G. Strouse R. Langermann S. Waksman G. Hultgren S.J. Mol.

These coordinates match an alignment that simulates the donor β-strand of the FimHC complex (5Choudhury D. Thompson A. Stojanoff V. Langermann S. Pinkner J. Hultgren S.J. Knight S.D.

The final structure was solvated in a periodic box of explicit water molecules that ranged in size from 129 to 140 × 78–91 × 84–91 Å3. Disulfide bonds were assumed between residues Cys3:Cys44 and Cys161:Cys187. Residue His45 was assumed to have both nitrogen atoms protonated due to the position of the negatively charged Asp47 and Asp100 residues (18Hung C.S. Bouckaert J. Hung D. Pinkner J. Widberg C. DeFusco A. Auguste C.G. Strouse R. Langermann S. Waksman G. Hultgren S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Ions (sodium and chlorine) were randomly added to the water box to: 1) give the solvent an ionic strength of 150 mm and 2) ensure the system had a zero net charge as required for the Particle Mesh Ewald algorithm. The computational mutation (A188D) was performed on the docked structure using the side chain prediction algorithm SCRWL3.0 (21Canutescu A.A. Shelenkov A.A. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2001-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). All simulations were performed using a 1-fs time step. Minimization was carried out in 80 steps and four stages to allow the entire system to reach a stable energy minimum. Thermalization was achieved in 40 ps by increasing the temperature in steps of 10 K every 1 ps until a final temperature of 310 K. Equilibration was conducted for 2 ns. During equilibration, the system was held at a temperature of 310 K and anisotropically coupled to a Berendsen pressure piston. The pressure was set to 1.013 bar with a relaxation time of 1 ps and a compressibility factor of 4.57 × 10-5 bar-1. To simulate separation of the two domains by mechanical force, the Cα atom on the N terminus of the donor β-strand (FimC Asn101) was pulled with a constant force in one direction and the O-1 atom of α-d-mannose was pulled with an equal force in the opposite direction. Individual simulations were performed for 500 to 1000 ps at constant forces that ranged from 50 to 250 pN. Fimbriae Purification—Fimbriae were purified from recombinant E. coli strains expressing type 1 fimbriae with different FimH essentially as described previously (8Sokurenko E.V. Chesnokova V.

Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB media to A600 = 0.6, induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, with induction continuing overnight at 16 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and periplasmic fractions were prepared using osmotic shock. Periplasmic proteins were precipitated with 55% ammonium sulfate and dialyzed overnight in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole. His-tagged proteins were purified on Ni-NTA-agarose according to standard procedures (Qiagen Inc.), dialyzed in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, and further purified on gel filtration column Superdex-75. Pd-His6 Expression and Purification—Pilin domain (residues 160–279) with dsc-extension was created as described for dsc-FimH (24Barnhart M.M. Pinkner J.S. Soto G.E. Sauer F.G. Langermann S.

Expression, periplasmic preparation, and purification on Ni-NTA-agarose was done as described for Ld (see above). Ni-NTA-purified fraction was dialyzed in 50 mm NaAc, pH 5.25, and loaded on a HiTrap CM column. Pd containing fraction was eluted in 50 mm NaAc, pH 5.25, buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and further fractionated on Superdex 75 gel filtration column.

Expression, preparation of periplasmic fraction, and purification on Ni-NTA-agarose was done as described above. A FimC-His6-FimFGH containing fraction after elution from Ni-NTA-agarose was dialyzed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.5 m NaCl and loaded on α-d-mannose-agarose column. After extensive washing tips were eluted with 10% α-d-mannose and fractionated on Superdex 75 gel filtration column. Binding of the tips to the Co2+ beads was done as described for Ld-His6. FimC-FimH Complex Purification—Genes encoding for FimC and FimH were cloned in tandem in pRSET-C plasmid under control of the T7 promoter. Plasmid was transformed into BL21Star cells. Expression and purification of the complex was done as described previously (57Jones C.H. Pindner J.S. Nicholes A.V. Slonim L.N. Abraham S.N. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8397-8401Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Bead-anchored FimH Construct Binding—Dynabeads® Talon™ Co2+ beads (Dynal Biotech) were coated with His-tagged FimH constructs as advised by the manufacturer using 0.22 μm protein per 10 μl of beads. Briefly, beads were washed in sodium phosphate buffer with 0.1% Tween 20, mixed with protein, and rotated for 20 min at room temperature, then washed 5 times with 0.75 ml of same buffer. Prepared beads were used in parallel plate flow chamber experiments at a final dilution of 1:1000 in the same way as whole bacteria. Solution Affinity Measurement—Solution affinity of purified fimbriae, fimbrial tips, and Ld was measured by surface plasmon resonance on Biacore2000™ (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) in solution competition experiments according to protocols described in the BIAevaluation Handbook (Biacore). In brief, 1M-BSA was immobilized on a CM5 censor chip via amino coupling at 2000 resonance units (2000 pg of ligand mm-2). A series of concentrations of fimbriae, tips, and Ld were injected over the 1M-BSA ligand at a flow rate of 20 ml min-1 in HBS-EP buffer (Biacore, Inc.) at 25 °C. To obtain the calibration curve, the average response value at a certain time point (in a 5-s time window) was plotted against concentration of the analyte. The fixed concentration of fimbriae, tips, or Ld (used for the calibration curve) was pre-equilibrated with several concentrations of α-methyl-d-mannopyranoside (1M) and injected over the same surface. The average response value at the same time point as above was determined, and the concentration of free analyte (not bound to mannose in solution and therefore able to bind mannose immobilized on the chip) was calculated using the calibration curve. Free analyte was plotted against the concentration of 1 m, and solution affinity analysis was performed to determine solution affinity (KD, M) using a general fit solution affinity in BIAevaluation software 3.0 (Biacore AB, Inc.). All experiments were performed at least twice with every curve in triplicates, different chips, sugar batches, and protein preparations used. Structural Alteration of the Pilin Domain Increases Mannose Binding of FimH—We previously compared the 1M-specific binding of bacteria expressing a hybrid adhesin containing residues 1–185 (including the entire Ld and N-terminal part of Pd) of the FimH variant from E. coli K12 (FimHK12) and residues 186 to 273 (the rest of Pd) of the adhesin FocH, which has 80% homology to FimH (15Sokurenko E.V. Schembri M.A. Trintchina E. Kjaergaard K. Hasty D.L. Klemm P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The hybrid exhibited very strong 1M binding activity under static conditions relative to FimHK12, suggesting an importance of the pilin domain to binding. At the same time, replacement of 202–273 residues with the corresponding FocH sequence did not affect binding (see supplemental Table 1S). Considering the results of the previous study, here we replaced residues 186–201 (YCAKSQNLGYYLSGTH) within the Pd of FimHK12 with the corresponding sequence from FocH (RCDQTQSVSYTLSGSV) to look in more detail at the influence of Pd structure on 1M binding. This FimHK12: (186–201)FocH mutant exhibited very strong 1M binding (Table 1). To probe the exact mutations that are responsible for the change in phenotype, we screened a number of point substitutions within this sequence of 16 aa. Whereas most point replacements did not affect the FimHK12 phenotype (for some examples, see supplemental Table 1S), two substitutions, Y186R and A188D, increased 1M binding significantly (Table 1). Of these two mutations, A188D resulted in the largest change in 1M binding.TABLE 1Strength of FimH-mediated binding in static conditions Binding of isogenic bacteria to immobilized 1M-BSA under static conditions (all binding is >90% inhibitable by mannose) and affinity of purified fimbriae, fimbrial tips, and lectin domains to soluble mannose in SPR experiments.

We have shown previously that neither the amount of FimH presented on the bacterial surface nor the fimbriae morphology change when a high 1M-binding mutant FimH or FimH/FocH hybrid is expressed (15Sokurenko E.V.

Here also, the fimbriae purified from the surface of bacteria expressing either FimHK12 or mutant FimH had the same amount of FimH (see supplemental Fig. 1S). To determine whether the increased 1M binding of bacteria was due an exposure of an additional 1M binding site within the mutant FimH, we introduced the mutation Q133A into FimH. This mutation alters a critical mannose-interacting residue within the only 1M binding pocket identified in the crystal structure (5Choudhury D. Thompson A. Stojanoff V. Langermann S. Pinkner J. Hultgren S.J. Knight S.D. Science. 1999; 285: 1061-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The Q133A replacement completely abolished the 1M-specific adhesion mediated by either FimHK12 or the FimHK12:A188D mutant (see supplemental Table 1S), demonstrating that the 1M high-binding FimH variants do not expose an additional 1M-binding site. Thus, the observed changes in 1M binding appear to be due to increased affinity of the 1M binding pocket in the mutant FimH. To test this directly, purified fimbriae from the FimHK12, FimHK12:(186–201)FocH, and FimHK12:A188D were examined for their solution affinity to soluble mannose using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Indeed, the affinity of the 1M high-binding FimH variants increased dramatically relatively to FimHK12, more than 15-fold in FimHK12:A188D and almost 300-fold in FimHK12:(186–201)FocH (Table 1). The same results were obtained when recombinant fimbrial tips were used that incorporate FimHK12 or FimHK12:A188D (Table 1). The fimbrial tips are composed of sequentially assembled FimH, FimG, and FimF subunits (with FimF complexed with His6-tagged FimC chaperone). Unlike fimbriae, however, these tips lack the polymeric major subunit FimA that forms the fimbrial rod. Together, these results demonstrate that the increase in 1M binding of FimH with the altered Pd structure is due to an increase in affinity toward the 1M ligand in a single FimH binding pocket located on the tip of the Ld. Thus, it appears that the binding pocket in the Ld can assume a low-affinity conformational state toward 1M in FimHK12 and a high-affinity state toward the 1M high-binding FimH variants.

TITLE: High Affinity Binding of Brain Myosin-Va to F-actin Induced by Calcium in the Presence of ATP
ABSTRACT: Brain myosin-Va consists of two heavy chains, each containing a neck domain with six tandem IQ motifs that bind four to five calmodulins and one to two essential light chains. Previous studies demonstrated that myosin-Va exhibits an unusually high affinity for F-actin in the presence of ATP and that its MgATPase activity is stimulated by micromolar Ca2+ in a highly cooperative manner. We demonstrate here that Ca2+ also induces myosin-Va binding to and cosedimentation with F-actin in the presence of ATP in a similar cooperative manner and calcium concentration range as that observed for the ATPase activity. Neither hydrolysis of ATP nor buildup of ADP was required for Ca2+-induced cosedimentation. The Ca2+-induced binding was inhibited by low temperature or by 0.6 m NaCl, but not by 1% Triton X-100. Tight binding between myosin-Va and pyrene-labeled F-actin in the presence of ATP and Ca2+ was also detected by quenching of the pyrene fluorescence. Negatively stained preparations of actomyosin-Va under Ca2+-induced binding conditions showed tightly packed F-actin bundles cross-linked by myosin-Va. Our data demonstrate that high affinity binding of myosin-Va and F-actin in the presence of ATP or 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) is induced by micromolar concentrations of Ca2+. Since Ca2+ regulates both the actin binding properties and actin-activated ATPase of myosin-Va over the same concentration range, we suggest that the calcium signal may regulate the mechanism of processivity of myosin Va.

Class V myosins have two motor head domains, typical of myosins, connected to the tail domain via an extended neck domain with six tandem IQ motifs that bind multiple light chains most or all of which, depending on the myosin, consist of calmodulin.

These properties are consistent with the postulated cellular functions of M-Va in organelle transport (16Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S.

Thus, high affinity for actin and processive movement would guarantee that M-Va with its cargo maintains contact with actin tracks. A troublesome difference between properties determined on the native protein versus the baculovirus-expressed constructs has been the lack of consistent results on the Ca2+ regulation of the mechanochemical events. Whereas the actin-activated ATPase of native M-Va is tightly regulated by Ca2+ (5Wang F. Chen L. Arcucci O. Harvey E.V. Bowers B. Xu Y. Hammer III, J.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol.

This apparent paradoxical effect of calcium on the ATPase activity of native M-Va in solution versus its motility as a surface-adsorbed molecule has not been satisfactorily explained, suggesting that there is much to be learned about the regulatory role of Ca2+ on the mechanochemical cycle of M-Va. The likely targets for Ca2+ are the calmodulin light chains, each with four potential Ca2+ binding sites, bound to the neck domain. There is direct evidence that calmodulin dissociates from M-Va in the presence of micromolar Ca2+ (11Homma K. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol.

Excess calmodulin protects against the irreversible blocking of motility by calcium, although the velocity of movement is still lowered in the presence of calcium (20Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K.

In the experiments described here, we show that micromolar Ca2+ induces high affinity binding of native chick M-Va to actin filaments in the presence of ATP or its nonhydrolyzable derivative, ATPγS. Three distinct methods have been used to characterize the actomyosin-Va complex induced by calcium: (a) cosedimentation of M-Va with F-actin, (b) quenching of pyrene-labeled F-actin by M-Va, and (c) electron microscopy imaging of the negative-stained actomyosin-Va. The results indicate that micromolar Ca2+ can be a switch that regulates the actin binding properties of M-Va and, consequently, may participate in the mechanism underlying processivity of this myosin. EDTA, EGTA, dithiothreitol, aprotinin, benzamidine, electrophoresis chemicals, imidazole, phalloidin, and ATP (grades I and II) were purchased from Sigma. ATPγS was purchased from Calbiochem and ADP from ICN. Chromatography media were purchased fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech and EM Separations Technology. Pefabloc was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.N-(1–1-Pyrenyl)iodoacetamide was purchased from Molecular Probes. Electron microscopy material was obtained from Electron Microscopy Science. M-Va was purified from chick brains essentially as described by Cheney (4Cheney R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Actin was purified from chicken breast muscle or rabbit dorsal muscle by the method of Spudich and Watt (22Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol.

Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) and further purified by ion exchange chromatography as described previously (24Costa M.C.

Fragment S1 from skeletal muscle myosin II was obtained by the method of Margossian and Lowey (25Margossian S.S. Lowey S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85, part B: 55-71Crossref Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The binding of M-Va to phalloidin-stabilized F-actin was assayed in buffer A (10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 75 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of 2 mm ATP, ADP, or ATPγS and Ca2+ concentrations as indicated. When done in the presence of the ATP-regenerating system, the reactions also contained 0.22 mm NADH, 20 units/ml lactic dehydrogenase, 100 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 0.5 mmphospho(enol)pyruvate, as described by De La Cruz (29De La Cruz E.M. Sweeney H.L. Ostap E.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1524-1529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A Ca-EGTA buffer was used in the assays covering a range of free [Ca2+] up to 10 µm. Free [Ca2+] was calculated using the computer program Mcalc (26Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar) with the Schwartzenbach dissociation constants. Unless otherwise stated, samples were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min followed by ultracentrifugation at 4 °C (100,000 × g for 30 min) to pellet F-actin. Resulting supernatants, and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie Blue-stained bands were quantified by densitometry and analyzed by using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Fluorescence assays were performed in quartz microcuvettes using buffer P (20 mm Pipes, pH 7.4, 75 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The concentration of pyrene-actin was fixed at 0.30 µm, and varying concentrations of M-Va or muscle myosin S1 were added as indicated. The mixtures were excited at 365 nm and the emission monitored at 405 nm using a DeltaScan fluorimeter (Photon Technology International, Mammoth Junction, NJ). The data were collected on line using the computer program Felix (Photon Technology International). This instrument was on loan from Photon Technology International to the Marine Biological Laboratory. For the steady state studies, reactions were mixed 1 min before taking a reading, and for the kinetic studies, readings were initiated as quickly as possible after mixing and thereafter taken at 1–30-s intervals. The S1 fragment from skeletal muscle myosin II was used as a control. For negative staining of actin filaments decorated with M-Va, mixtures of phalloidin-stabilized F-actin (0.48–1.0 µm) and M-Va (0.1–0.48 µm) were incubated for 5–10 s in buffer A in the presence or absence of 2 mm ATP or ATPγS and then immediately applied to nitrocellulose-carbon-coated copper grids for 10–20 s, rinsed, and fixed by application of buffer A containing 2% glutaraldehyde and negatively stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate. Pyrene-actin was obtained by conjugatingN-(1–1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide to purified actin as described by Kouyama and Mihashi (27Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed using 4–20% linear gradient mini-gels. The concentrations of purified proteins were calculated based on the following extinction coefficients at 280 nm for 1 mg/ml solutions: 1.04 for M-Va (20Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E.

Several laboratories have now shown that M-Va has an unusually high affinity for F-actin in the presence of ATP, based on determinations of the activation of the MgATPase by F-actin (K ATPasevalues ranging from 0.15 to 1.8 µm) and by cosedimentation and light scattering studies of M-Va and low concentrations of F-actin in the presence of ATP (7Trybus K.M.

Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17561-17569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Previous studies on native chick M-Va (12Nascimento A.A.C. Cheney R.E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17561-17569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) have shown that the ATPase activity and the percentage of M-Va that cosedimented with F-actin was significantly increased by the addition of Ca2+ at micromolar concentrations. In the experiments described here (Fig.1A), we obtained very little cosedimentation in the presence of ATP at submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+ and nearly 100% cosedimentation of chick M-Va with 1 µm F-actin in the presence of ∼10 µmfree [Ca2+]. The effect of Ca2+ was reversible, since the sequential addition of EGTA, after incubation with Ca2+, liberated M-Va to the supernatant (Fig.1 A). Since Ca2+ stimulates the ATP hydrolytic activity of M-Va, and since ADP has a relatively high affinity for M-Va, we considered the possibility that the Ca2+ effect is mediated by the formation of ADP and displacement of ATP at the nucleotide-binding site. However, the presence of ADP at equimolar concentration with ATP did not induce cosedimentation of M-Va and actin in the absence of Ca2+, although ADP alone clearly did (Fig. 1 A). Also, when done in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system, Ca2+ still induced the cosedimentation of M-Va and actin (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the data indicate that ADP does not mediate the Ca2+ effect. The Ca2+ concentration dependence of the cosedimentation (Fig.2) was highly cooperative with a maximum effect at about 3 µm Ca2+. A Hill plot of the data (not shown) suggests the involvement of about eight Ca2+-binding sites per myosin molecule. This result is strikingly similar to the activation curve of the actin-activated, MgATPase of M-Va over the same range of Ca2+ concentrations (12Nascimento A.A.C. Cheney R.E. Tauhata S.B.F. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17561-17569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and, thus, suggests that calcium is affecting the ATPase activity and myosin binding to actin via a common effector. Since there are four to five calmodulin molecules bound to each neck domain of M-Va, and each calmodulin has four potential Ca2+-binding sites, the data are consistent with the involvement of at least two or more molecules of calmodulin per M-Va. The present data show that micromolar Ca2+ indeed induces reversible binding of M-Va to F-actin in the presence of ATP.Figure 2The effect of Ca2+ on the cosedimentation of M-Va and F-actin is highly cooperative in the micromolar range. The percentage of M-Va in the pellet was determined by densitometry of the M-Va heavy chain after cosedimentation assays performed as in Fig. 1, except that the free Ca2+ concentration was varied from submicromolar concentrations up to 3.5 µm. The cosedimentation of M-Va in the absence of ATP was considered to be 100%. Each data point is the average of three determinations. The line was drawn connecting the average values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Almost complete cosedimentation of M-Va was obtained at submicromolar concentrations of phalloidin-stabilized F-actin in the presence of Ca2+ and either ATP or its nonhydrolyzable analog, ATPγS (Fig. 3). Both nucleotides gave similar activation curves, and the joint data indicate that 50% of the M-Va cosedimented with F-actin at concentrations of ∼0.1 µm. Note that about 0.3 µm actin was capable of binding 0.3 µmM-Va, indicating that single-headed binding predominated under the conditions of this experiment. Thus, the Ca2+-induced binding shows a very high affinity for actin and does not appear to require the hydrolysis of ATP. To further characterize the Ca2+-induced cosedimentation, we tested the effects of temperature, elevated NaCl concentration, and Triton X-100. Cosedimentation experiments were normally done by mixing M-Va and F-actin from stock solutions on ice into buffered reaction mixtures at room temperature followed by incubation at 25 °C for 10 min in a water bath, followed by centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C. In the experiments illustrated in Fig.4A, the reaction tubes were maintained on ice for 10 min immediately after the addition of the proteins, and either centrifuged directly or incubated at 25 °C for 1 or 10 min, followed by centrifugation. The results demonstrated that an incubation of about 10 min at 25 °C was necessary for complete cosedimentation of M-Va and actin. In Fig. 4 B, the addition of 0.6 m NaCl to the reaction mix partially inhibited the cosedimentation induced by Ca2+ in the presence of ATP, but not under rigor conditions (Fig. 4 B). Thus, the binding properties under Ca2+-induced cosedimentation are not equivalent to the rigor state. On the other hand, extraction with 1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 4 C) did not alter the cosedimentation whether in the presence or absence of ATP, indicating that Ca2+ induces a robust, detergent-resistant, binding state. A sensitive method for analyzing tight binding of myosin to actin is to monitor the fluorescence of pyrene-labeled F-actin (25Margossian S.S. Lowey S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85, part B: 55-71Crossref Scopus (825) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 5A, increasing concentrations of M-Va promoted a decrease in the pyrene-actin fluorescence under rigor conditions or in the presence of ATP when Ca2+ was present. A single determination at 0.33 µm M-Va showed that Ca2+ was necessary for the quenching effect when ATP was present. The end point was approximately the same under either rigor or with ATP and Ca2+, although the concentration of M-Va necessary to attain 50% of the maximum quench was three times greater when ATP was present than under rigor conditions. The S1 fragment from skeletal muscle myosin also quenched pyrene-actin under rigor conditions to a similar extent, but with lower affinity, as M-Va, but not when ATP and Ca2+ were present (Fig. 5 B). Thus, M-Va is distinctive in this property. This method also allowed for a time course analysis of the effects of individual components on the myosin-actin binding. The fluorescence of pyrene-actin was first monitored with M-Va in the rigor state (Fig.6A). The addition of ATP resulted in a rapid increase in fluorescence with a slower second component reaching maximum fluorescence in about 2 min. Then, the addition of Ca2+ resulted in an initial rapid drop in fluorescence, 50% of the total quenching effect occurring within about 40 s, followed by a slower component attaining fluorescent levels near those of the rigor state in about 10 min. (Note that since these experiments involved manual mixing, the exact kinetics was not determined.) Similar experiments with S1 from muscle (Fig.6 B) showed that ATP induced its disassociation from actin, but no significant quenching occurred upon Ca2+addition. The complexes formed by the addition of M-Va to F-actin in the presence of Ca2+ and ATP were examined by electron microscopy of negatively stained preparations using conditions identical to those in the cosedimentation assays of Figs. 1 and 2 (M-Va:actin at 1:10). As noted in earlier studies (20Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forscher P. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 13-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), under rigor conditions M-Va induces the formation of tight, actin bundles in both the absence (not shown) and presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 7B), although “arrowhead” decoration of the filaments is not observed at these low ratios of M-Va to actin. In the presence of ATP, bundles were also seen in the presence (Fig. 7 D) but not in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 7 C). These bundles, seen best at low magnification (inset to Fig. 7 D), are more curved than under rigor conditions. At saturating ratios of M-Va to actin we were unable to adequately visualize the bundles at high magnification because of the formation of uranyl phosphate precipitates. However, in the presence of Ca2+ and ATPγS, 1:1 mixtures of M-Va and actin contained tight, often highly curved bundles of actin (forming circles and figure eights) on which the M-Va cross-links could be detected (Fig. 8). In contrast to rigor conditions (20Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forscher P. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 13-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar); however, arrowhead decoration under these conditions was not observed. Since the tail domain does not bind actin (12Nascimento A.A.C. Cheney R.E. Tauhata S.B.F. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17561-17569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), these bundles are presumably formed by head-head linkages between two actin filaments.Figure 8Electron micrographs of actomyosin Va in the presence of Ca2+ and ATPγS.Mixtures of 0.24 µm phalloidin-stabilized F-actin with 0.48 µm M-Va in the presence of ATPγS and 13 µm free Ca2+ were negatively stained immediately after mixing.

This effect of Ca2+ has not been observed in any other myosin biochemically characterized to date. The similarity in the concentration range and cooperative behavior of Ca2+ on the actin-binding properties of M-Va shown here, compared with its effect on the actin-activated MgATPase activity (12Nascimento A.A.C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17561-17569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggests that both effects result from a common site of action, most likely the specific binding of Ca2+ to multiple calmodulins associated with the elongated neck domain of this myosin. The exact mechanism that links Ca2+ binding to these effects is not known, although models for the structural interaction of light chains with the α-helical neck domain have been proposed (28Houdusse A. Silver M. Cohen C. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 1475-1490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and recent work has shown that at least two IQ motifs with bound calmodulins are sufficient to obtain Ca2+-regulated ATPase and in vitro motility activities (7Trybus K.M.

It has been demonstrated that Ca2+ induces the release of one or more calmodulins from the neck domain at micromolar concentrations (11Homma K. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34766-34771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forscher P. Larson R.E.

Thus, the accumulated evidence clearly indicates that the calmodulins associated with the neck domain have a role in the Ca2+ regulation of the mechanochemical events of the motor-head domain. There is a clear, but unexplained, difference in Ca2+effects on the recombinant versus native M-Va samples. All of the recombinant proteins that express the head domain plus varying IQ and coiled-coil regions show actin-activated MgATPase activities and motility on in vitro assays more or less equivalent to the native protein, indicating that the basic, mechanochemical properties are well preserved for all of these biochemical fractions. On the other hand, quite unlike native M-Va (5Wang F. Chen L. Arcucci O. Harvey E.V. Bowers B. Xu Y. Hammer III, J.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol.

Exogenous calmodulin can either partially or completely overcome the inhibition by Ca2+, but in no case has activation been shown. This difference was most pointedly demonstrated by directly comparing the Ca2+effects on recombinant and native murine M-Va (5Wang F. Chen L. Arcucci O. Harvey E.V. Bowers B. Xu Y. Hammer III, J.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4329-4335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, either the tail domain, present in the native but not in the recombinant fractions, is somehow involved in regulation of the mechanochemical events, or the functional, native light chain arrangement has not been achieved on the recombinant proteins. A third possibility, suggested by Trybus and collaborators (7Trybus K.M. Krementsova E. Freyzon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27448-27456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), is that the purified native protein has become “uncoupled”, perhaps due to the extraction procedure. The high sensitivity, cooperative behavior, and the reversibility of the Ca2+ effects on M-Va shown in the present study argue against this latter possibility. Recent evidence suggests that ADP release is the rate-limiting step of the mechanochemical cycle of M-Va (8De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Also, the affinity of M-Va for ADP is quite high, thus product inhibition rapidly becomes significant over short reaction times (29De La Cruz E.M. Sweeney H.L. Ostap E.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1524-1529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Since Ca2+ also stimulates the actin-activated MgATPase of M-Va, we must consider the possibility that the effect of Ca2+ on the M-Va/F-actin affinity is indirect, via the formation of ADP and its competition for the nucleotide-binding site. The most direct evidence against this possibility, shown in Fig. 1, is the demonstration that the presence of ADP at equimolar concentration with ATP did not result in cosedimentation in the absence of Ca2+ and that even in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system the addition of Ca2+induced the cosedimentation between actin and M-Va. Furthermore, the pyrene-actin experiments, shown in Figs. 5 and 6, also address this question. Under conditions appropriate for low ATPase activity (very low actin concentration, 0.3 µm, well below theK ATPase of chick M-Va), the presence of 5 mm ATP brought the fluorescence up to free pyrene-actin levels, and in turn, the addition of Ca2+ caused an immediate, rapid drop in fluorescence, indicating the reformation of a tight actomyosin-Va complex. Finally, equivalent, high affinity binding also occurred with ATPγS, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, as with ATP itself (Fig. 3); thus, the hydrolysis of ATP to form ADP was not a necessary step. Together, the evidence indicates that purified, native M-Va forms a tight complex with F-actin in the presence of ATP if Ca2+ is also present. This complex has properties unlike the rigor state, is reversibly undone by removing Ca2+, and does not require ATP hydrolysis nor the presence of ADP. The fact that Ca2+ has a dual effect on the mechanochemical properties of M-Va, activation of the actin-activated MgATPase activity and induction of high affinity binding between M-Va and F-actin, suggests that Ca2+ may participate in the mechanism of processivity of this molecular motor. There is much evidence that class V myosins associate with organelles in eukaryotes and have a role in their cellular transport (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Provance Jr., D.W. Mercer J.A. Cell.

The phenotype produced by mutations in the dilute locus in mice, whose product is M-Va, is illustrative of this role. Dilutemelanocytes are characterized by an accumulation of melanosomes at the cell center, whereas wild-type melanocytes show a polarized distribution of melanosomes toward the dendritic tips. In the latter case, this process delivers pigment to the keratinocytes and subsequently to hair and skin. Thus, M-Va has a role in the transport and/or peripheral localization of the pigment granules. A recently advanced hypothesis, coined the “cooperative/capture mechanism” (32Wu X. Bowers B. Rao K. Wei Q. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1899-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), is based on evidence that long range transport of pigment granules occurs principally by bi-directional movement along microtubules, but a M-Va- and actin-dependent capture of the melanosomes occurs at the cell periphery where microtubules terminate and the cortical F-actin network is abundant. The mechanism of capture may involve physical restriction inherent to an isotopic actin network (32Wu X. Bowers B. Rao K. Wei Q. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1899-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), but we also suggest, based on the biochemical properties of M-Va we have described here, that Ca2+ may act as a switch that would favor capture by increasing the M-Va and actin interaction. We would hypothesize that, under the normally low Ca2+ concentration in the cell, M-Va would be activated as a motor whenever in contact with the actin cytoskeleton. On the other hand, at local regions of higher Ca2+ concentration actomyosin Va would switch to a higher affinity, higher ATP turnover state, or “into an extremely low gear” as expressed by Provance and Mercer (1Provance Jr., D.W. Mercer J.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This would be a dynamic state that would tend to decrease overall motility as well as maintain localization and could be reversed by lowering Ca2+ levels. Indeed, Wu et al. (32Wu X. Bowers B. Rao K. Wei Q. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1899-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and Tsakraklides et al. (33Tsakraklides V. Krogh K. Wang L. Bizario J.C. Larson R.E. Espreafico E.M. Wolenski J.S. J.

This dynamic process would confer plasticity to organelle traffic, linking melanosome distribution to signal transduction mechanisms. In fish chromatophores, increases in free Ca2+ have been seen to accompany pigment aggregation (34de Lauro Castrucci A.M. Visconti M.A. Hadley M.E. Hruby V.J. Oshima N. Fujii R. Prog. Clin. Biol.

Thus, Ca2+ could trigger the accumulation mechanism at the periphery via regulation of M-Va/actin binding and induction of a dynamic anchored state at the cost of ATP cycling. We thank Domingus E.

TITLE: Morality is fundamentally an evolved solution to problems of social co‐operation
ABSTRACT: This debate took place at the Association of Social Anthropologists (ASA) conference in Oxford on 21 September 2018, following the model of the Group Debates in Anthropological Theory at the University of Manchester (GDAT). It brought together and into confrontation two of anthropology's relatively new sub-fields (new at least in their current incarnations), namely evolutionary anthropology and the anthropology of morality and/or ethics. Although organized by a social anthropology professional body, the conference organizers – in line with the wishes of the ASA committee at the time of the call for conference proposals (in 2016) – sought to encourage participation from all forms of anthropology, including archaeology. It was therefore fitting that the debate should pose a question that is of interest across the broad spectrum of anthropology and well beyond, highlighting, we hoped, the venerable anthropological ambition to contribute to the resolution of long-standing and intractable philosophical questions. The proposition, 'morality is fundamentally an evolved solution to problems of social co-operation', encapsulates a theory developed by Oliver Scott Curry, along with colleagues attached to the Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology (ICEA) and (since 2019) the Centre for the Study of Social Cohesion (CSSC) within the School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography (SAME) in Oxford. This theory, known as 'morality as co-operation' or MAC, seeks to explain morality in a systematic cross-cultural manner by means of controlled and operationalized comparison (Curry 2016; Curry, Mullins & Whitehouse 2019). It seemed appropriate to ask Oliver to propose the motion and to select his own seconder. As prospective chair of the debate, I approached colleagues who might be interested in opposing the motion from the perspective of the new anthropology of morality, and the idea of the debate began to take shape.11 The text follows very closely what was actually said on the day, but small adjustments have been made in response to suggestions from two anonymous reviewers. At the outset of the debate, and before any arguments had been heard, an indicative vote was held: thirteen people were in favour of the proposition, six were against, and there were six abstentions. At the end of the debate, another vote was held, which went entirely the other way: four people voted for the proposition, twenty-four against, and two abstained. It would be unwise to read too much into the votes, however. The debate stretched over two sessions with a coffee break in the middle. Many people who were present at the beginning were no longer in the room at the end; many people arrived, other parallel sessions having finished, who were not there at the beginning. (Owing to the sheer number of panels at the conference, it was not possible to clear two plenary sessions for the debate.) As one might have expected, especially given the framing of Curry's theory as scientific, the debate set up an opposition between a reductionist evolutionary account of morality, on the one side, and a humanist and anti-reductionist stance, on the other (and, depending on your point of view, 'reductionist' should not necessarily be understood negatively; most of the time, reductionist explanation is just what science does and indeed it could be argued to be the glory of science). Is the co-operation of bees or ants anything to do with, or even remotely the same thing as, co-operation by humans? Can the social behaviour of closely related species tell us anything about the social behaviour of humans? If we put aside the insect-human and primate-human comparisons or contrasts, is it possible to compare co-operation and morality across very different societies? Does it make sense to assume that there is a single virtue of generosity or bravery that can be meaningfully compared in very different contexts, or even between different generations? Or is comparison simply impossible? Can issues of scale be ignored for the sake of comparison? Do they fatally undermine any attempt to construct systematic comparable datasets, or can they comfortably be accounted for within a scientific theory? If morality is not about co-operation, then what is it about? Ultimately, whether you find any plausibility in attempts to generalize across time and space, with all the necessary simplifications that requires, may depend on whether you are a natural lumper or a natural splitter. Splitters will always prefer to focus on the cultural and historical differences – which undoubtedly are always there. What is morality? Where does it come from, how does it work, what is it for? Are there any universal moral values, or does morality vary radically from place to place? Scholars have debated these questions for millennia; now, thanks to science, we have the answers. Converging lines of evidence – from game theory, ethology, psychology, and anthropology – suggest that morality is a collection of biological and cultural solutions to the problems of co-operation recurrent in human social life. For 50 million years, humans and their ancestors have lived in social groups (Shultz, Opie & Atkinson 2011). During this time, they have faced a range of different problems of co-operation, and they have evolved and invented a range of different solutions to them. Natural selection favoured adaptations for realizing the tremendous opportunities for mutually beneficial non-zero-sum interaction that social life affords. More recently, humans built on these beneficent biological foundations with cultural innovations – norms, rules, laws – that further boost co-operation. Together, these biological and cultural mechanisms provide the motivation for social, co-operative, and altruistic behaviour; they provide the criteria by which we evaluate the behaviour of others. And, according to the theory of 'morality as co-operation' (MAC), it is precisely this collection of co-operative traits – these instincts, intuitions, and institutions – that constitute human morality (Curry 2016). What's more, because there are many different types of co-operation (technically, many different stable strategies for achieving superior equilibria in non-zero-sum games), the theory leads us to expect, and can explain, many different types of morality. Kin selection explains why we feel a special duty of care for our families, and why we abhor incest. Mutualism explains why we form groups and coalitions (there is strength and safety in numbers), and hence why we value unity, solidarity, and loyalty. Social exchange explains why we trust others, reciprocate favours, feel guilt and gratitude, make amends, and forgive. Conflict resolution explains why we engage in costly displays of prowess such as bravery and generosity, why we defer to our superiors, why we divide disputed resources fairly, and why we recognize prior possession. As predicted by MAC, these seven moral rules – love your family, help your group, return favours, be brave, defer to your superiors, be fair, and respect others' property – appear to be universal across cultures. My colleagues and I analysed 600 ethnographic accounts of ethics from sixty societies, comprising over 600,000 words (Curry, Mullins & Whitehouse 2019). We found, first, that these seven co-operative behaviours were always considered morally good. Second, we found examples of most of these morals in most societies. Crucially, there were no counter-examples – no societies in which any of these behaviours were considered morally bad. And third, we observed these morals with equal frequency across continents; they were not the exclusive preserve of 'the West' or any other region. For example, among the Amhara, 'flouting kinship obligation is regarded as a shameful deviation, indicating an evil character'. In Korea, there exists an 'egalitarian community ethic [of] mutual assistance and cooperation among neighbors [and] strong in-group solidarity'. 'Reciprocity is observed in every stage of Garo life [and] has a very high place in the Garo social structure of values'. Among the Maasai, 'Those who cling to warrior virtues are still highly respected', and 'the uncompromising ideal of supreme warriorhood [involves] ascetic commitment to self-sacrifice … in the heat of battle, as a supreme display of courageous loyalty'. The Bemba exhibit 'a deep sense of respect for elders' authority'. The Kapauku 'idea of justice' is called 'uta-uta, half-half … [the meaning of which] comes very close to what we call equity'. And among the Tarahumara, 'respect for the property of others is the keystone of all interpersonal relations' (all quoted in Curry, Mullins & Whitehouse 2019: 55). These results suggest that there is a common core of universal moral principles. Morality is always and everywhere a co-operative phenomenon. Everyone everywhere agrees that co-operating, promoting the common good, is the right thing to do. MAC does not predict that moral values will be identical across cultures. On the contrary, it predicts 'variations on a theme': moral values will reflect the value of different types of co-operation under different social and ecological conditions. Indeed, it was our impression that these societies did vary in how they prioritized or ranked the seven moral values. With further research, gathering new data on moral values in contemporary societies, we shall be able to explore the causes of this variation (Curry, Jones Chesters & van Lissa 2019). Further research will also be needed to investigate whether there are additional types of co-operation that can explain additional types of morality; and whether this co-operative account can be extended to incorporate as yet under-theorized aspects of morality, such as sexual and environmental ethics. In this way, through the steady application of scientific method, we will discover whether co-operation fulfils its promise of providing the elusive 'grand unified theory of morality' that at last explains both the commonalities and the varieties of ethical experience. In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams tells us that many millions of years ago a race of beings created a super-computer, called Deep Thought, to calculate 'The Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything'. Deep Thought took seven and a half million years to run the program and on the Day of the Answer large crowds gathered to hear what the great computer had come up with. After warning them that they wouldn't like it, Deep Thought revealed that 'The Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything' is … 42. The problem, as Deep Thought pointed out to the unhappy beings, was that they had never actually known what the question was. '42' is a perfectly good answer; the problem is that it is not an answer to a question that anyone thought they had asked. Today's proposition, that morality is fundamentally an evolved solution to problems of social co-operation, presents us with a similar kind of answer. To propose that morality is an evolved solution for co-operation is to explain 'what morality is, where it comes from, how it works and what it is for' (Curry 2016: 44). It is the equivalent of asking under what selective pressure morality arose, through what mechanisms it works, and what function it performs in the perpetuation of human evolution. It is to imagine a set of problems, and a set of dispositions, values, or behaviours as the solution to those problems, each generally of the same category or type though varying in specific content, with each instance of morality being a variant of a basic sort of 'solution'. I find this representation of morality odd and unlikely. I have a series of objections, which I will seek to keep distinct in the course of what follows. My objections are empirical (I don't think that morality is 'like that'), theoretical (I don't find the argument convincing), and moral (I don't think that people should think of morality in this way). I will argue that the proposition is wrong and wrong-headed on three counts: first, it misunderstands the nature of explanation; second, it mischaracterizes co-operation; and, third, it mistakenly portrays morality. I will demonstrate that the consequences of these mistakes are irrelevance, overconfidence, and functionalist sophistry. It is a mistake to think that in explaining morality as an evolutionary function we have 'explained morality'. It is one kind of explanation, one that is interesting, but largely irrelevant to the study of morality. The question 'What is morality for?' and the question 'What is the good life?' are different kinds of questions, and we need not assume that they will have the same answers. The degree to which any explanation will be sufficient or persuasive depends in part on the question that motivates it and the audience for whom it is intended. Explanation is always motivated – it is always an explanation in answer to a certain kind of question – and so explanation can never be simply of a thing (a value, a mood, a process, an organization, etc.). To co-opt an example from Putnam (1978: 42-3; cited in Laidlaw 2007), Professor X is found naked in the girls' dormitory at midnight. Now, this can be explained correctly by saying that (a) he was naked in the girls' dormitory at midnight, so he could not have exited the dormitory before midnight without exceeding the speed of light, and that (b) nothing can travel faster than the speed of light (and certainly not naked professors). This is an explanation for Professor X's night-time location, but it is not an explanation that is relevant to most of the questions that most people would have about the circumstances of his nocturnal adventures. Neurobiology, cognitive psychology, and Darwinian evolutionary theory provide important insights into panhuman dispositions. Evolutionary developments in social co-operation in our hominin ancestors led to the domestication of fire, collective child-rearing, and co-operative hunting. These may have created strong psychological predispositions towards pro-social behaviour, but they reveal as much about morality as the Neolithic Revolution reveals about the fall of the Berlin Wall or the unifying magnetism of David Hasselhoff. The result of applying this method to the study of morality is a generality that is true, to the extent that it is true (and of course it can be argued that it is false: Haidt & Graham 2007; Haidt & Joseph 2011; see Wong 2006). However, it is irrelevant to any understanding of particularity, and fails to deal with any meaning that morality might have for anyone going about the business of living their lives. Explaining what morality is 'for' would be admirable if it was the answer to a question that anyone had asked, but it is not, and posed in this way the answer may as well be 42. In this case, the explanation of morality as a solution to a problem is incoherent both because it is an unsatisfactory answer to questions anyone might have about morality, and because it presents a unitary 'Grand Unified Theory of Morality' (Curry, Mullins & Whitehouse 2019), where no such theory could exist. My suggestion here isn't that one kind of explanation is somehow better or worse than another, but that there are different kinds of explanation, and they do the work of answering different kinds of questions. As such, a theory that explains morality as 'fundamentally' a solution to an evolutionary problem is both myopic and wrong-headed. In his proposition, our opponent writes: 'Scholars have debated these questions [about the nature of morality] for millennia; now, thanks to science, we have the answers' (see also Curry 2016: 27). But even if we were persuaded that this proposition provided one sufficient explanation of morality (which, I will argue, it doesn't), it must surely be hubris to assert that because something 'scientific' has been said on a subject, that is the final word and nothing else of value may be contributed. That this proposition would pass by excluding most of what we normally mean by morality is important for assessing its persuasiveness. Our opponent tells us that we need find morality 'baffling' (Curry 2016: 27) no longer, because 'now, thanks to science, we have the answers' (above). This works because it both implicitly and explicitly excludes humanistic methods from the study of morality. As Laidlaw (2007) points out, the irony of finding a Grand Unified Theory of Morality in game theory is that it pits cognitive anthropology in a zero-sum relationship with humanist disciplines. Putting critiques of the form of the proposition aside, does MAC make logical sense on its own terms? 'Co-operation' is an odd word because its meaning is almost entirely positive. It does not mean 'manipulative', 'orchestrating the will of others'; it does not mean 'lacking in autonomy'. It means 'working together towards the same ends', 'assistance and support', 'mutual benefit'. These are usually seen as positive traits or activities (as our opponents argue); 'co-operation' is understood to be a good thing. As such, 'co-operation' amongst humans is informed by a normative meaning, which is different to the meaning of 'co-operation' in evolutionary theory. Human co-operation is rarely a goal or value in and of itself, but rather a consequence of other goals and values as people seek to lead meaningful lives. My understanding of evolutionary theory is that units of selection may be understood to be in 'competitive interactions' that have 'a winner and a loser', or 'cooperative interactions' that result in 'win-win situations' (Curry, Mullins & Whitehouse 2019: 48). However, only humans may be understood to 'co-operate' or 'compete' in the full human sense of having appropriate motives. Most selective competition does not require competitive motives and, as Midgley says: 'Absolutely none of it below the human level can proceed from dynastic ambition' (1979: 446). All sorts of animals co-operate and respond to the co-operative behaviour of others. Yet bees, ants, and so on, are not thought of as moral in the way that humans are. Eighteenth-century naturalists may have projected their moral values on to the industry of the beehive (Daston 2004), but it is rare today to find anyone who thinks of bees as 'moral' because they co-operate. The 'technical' co-operation of nonhumans is a different order of co-operation to that of humans, informed by moral values, friendship, love, what have you. In this 'non-technical' sense, nonhumans cannot co-operate, or compete for that matter. To borrow from Midgley, bees and ants cannot co-operate 'any more than atoms can be jealous, elephants abstract or biscuits teleological' (1979: 439). It might be countered that the proposition rests on a higher-order theory. Our opponents might concur that bees or ants are not moral, whilst still claiming that they are co-operating, and that human co-operation is of the same order. They may claim that they mean 'co-operation' in the technical sense with reference to humans and that humans have evolved 'morality' in order to make us do the thing that this term describes (whereas bees haven't because they presumably don't need to). Once one concedes that human 'co-operation' is informed by complex motivation, then it cannot be used to refer to 'technical' co-operation equivalent to that of bees or what have you. Co-operation, when used in a 'non-technical' sense, is already morally loaded. To say that 'morality is fundamentally an evolved solution to problems of social co-operation' is either to shift the way in which one is using 'co-operation' to a sense which incorporates some understanding of complex motivation into the processes of natural selection, or it is to maintain a 'technical' use of the word, and therefore to necessarily discount motivation from the analysis. You can't have it both ways. One problem with today's proposition is that it strongly suggests that an elemental analysis provides an explanation of morality. For example, elsewhere, our opponent has extended today's proposition to develop 'a novel taxonomy of moral values – a "Periodic Table of Ethics"' (Curry 2016: 37). Morality can be divided into its 'elements', which we can study, combine, and experiment with. In the process, 'the study of morality has at last become a branch of science' (Curry 2016: 29). The problem is that morality is not the sort of 'thing' that can have distinct units. This is the same mistake, in a reverse direction, that Aristotelian physics made when it extended an explanation of purpose from humans to inanimate matter: stones do not have purposes, but neither does morality have elements (Midgley 2001). A moment's reflection reveals that moral concepts, friendship, bravery, humility, and so on, couldn't possibly be thought of as unchanging or remotely stable. On one level, the level of the proposition, I may identify friendship, commitment, fidelity, and justice in some sort of external way, such that friendship at 50 may be equivalent to friendship at 15, or courage in Papua New Guinea may be thought of as the same 'thing' as courage in the Bronx. For such comparisons to take place, the comparison must be some unit of behaviour, which is taken to be comparable. It is something that is external to the subject, visible in speech or action, and democratic in the sense that all people experience it in the same way and to the same degree. The other sense of knowing what a moral concept means is knowing its value in depth, for example knowing the value of friendship. And that cannot be as democratic as the unitary model would have it because as soon as we introduce words like justice, fidelity, or friendship we necessarily introduce ideas of process and context. For us as historically and culturally located humans, the meaning of moral concepts 'deepens' as we learn. As a concept like friendship is known it is transformed, as are we through the knowing of it. The move is towards the personal, towards the ideal limit, not backwards towards a separable comparable public unit (Murdoch 2001 [1971]: 28). My moral objection to the proposition is the lurking fatalism that informs it: the idea that moral deliberation, learning, and growth are illusory. Fatalism is seductive because it offers a simple explanation for why I am good, or why I fail to be so; why some people love their neighbours and others don't. The answer is to be found not in personal fallibility or the messy complexity of human life but in an evolved need for co-operation. This is not the calculating prudence of a Hobbesian social insurance policy; we do these things, it is thought, because they are the mechanisms by which the species is perpetuated. If one thing must, by definition, count on the terms with which people understand it, it is surely morality. Otherwise, to tell people that their more decent feelings are not for themselves, that they are the product of powers over which they have no influence, is not to take them at their word. It is to discount human freedom and will. The proposition doesn't explain morality; instead it claims that on morality's own terms, it isn't really there at all. I am persuaded that humans have some innate adaptive machinery, and that this informs who we are and what we do, but I do not think that morality is because of this. I have demonstrated that, on its own terms, the proposition is absurd, since it links the positive moral value of co-operative behaviour to a subject for which it can make no sense at all: evolutionary co-operation. Morality is not a 'solution': it cannot be 'for' something in the way that a deep socket wrench is for a ratchet head. Nor can morality be sufficiently accounted for through an elemental analysis: no single explanation of morality can account for the historically specific forms that morality takes, or the work of self-reflection, will, value, judgement, and hope. I can see why a unitary theory might be appealing, or at least it might seem to be appealing until you get the answer: 'co-operation' is no more useful or intellectually or morally satisfying an answer than '42'. Explaining morality as an evolved mechanism for co-operation means that my explanations of myself do not count for themselves, and as such it explains away all and any meaning that morality might have, individually or socially. I propose that my argument, that moral concepts and ways of thinking have meaning in relation to motivation and context in culturally and historically situated life, provides a better account of morality than the proposition. To be clear, I am not arguing for an alternative explanation of what morality is for. I hope to have demonstrated that the question is wrong-headed and could never have a satisfactory answer. However, my approach helps us to account for moral striving, process, and variety. Of course, it would be possible to make an argument like this for any kind of concept: that our concept of the economy, or debt, or exchange, for example, is transformed through our engagement with it (indeed many would say that is basic to anthropological thought). My argument is not that other things couldn't be framed in this way; it is that moral concepts must be. Many thanks for including a philosopher in your debate. I hope that my more normative perspective on this fascinating proposition will be interesting and useful. In philosophy, we distinguish two aspects of ethics: axiology and deontics. Axiology is the theory of the good: it's meant to describe and explain the values that contribute to a person's welfare, either instrumentally or intrinsically. Deontics is the theory of right action: it's meant to describe and explain what it is for an action, policy, or institution to be obligatory, permissible, or impermissible. A pair of related sources of values are needs (Weil 2002 [1949]) and capabilities (Sen 1985). On the one hand, needs characterize minimal conditions for human lives to be worth living. Needs range from the most obvious biological constraints, such as air, water, food, clothing, shelter, and touch, to more sophisticated and enculturated necessities. I'm sure that most of us here would feel naked and alone without access to electricity and Wi-Fi. On the other hand, capabilities characterize the range of powers that transform a life of bare coping to one of flourishing. These include literacy, numeracy, emotional competence, practical reason, friendship, and a modicum of material and political control (Nussbaum 2000). Values answer to needs and capabilities. Something is valuable to the extent that it satisfies needs and supports capabilities, disvaluable to the extent that it frustrates needs and undermines capabilities. If this is right, then to the extent that there are species-universal needs and capabilities, there will be species-universal values. Owing to our embodiment, finitude, and interdependency, we humans do in fact share many needs and capabilities. For that reason, it should be unsurprising that we also share many of our values. By rooting values in needs and capabilities, we avoid committing the naturalistic fallacy. We should admit to ourselves with all due severity exactly what will be necessary for a long time to come and what is provisionally correct, namely: collecting material, formulating concepts, and putting into order the tremendous realm of tender value feelings and value distinctions that live, grow, reproduce, and are destroyed, – and, perhaps, attempting to illustrate the recurring and more frequent shapes of this living crystallization, – all of which would be a preparation for a typology of morals (Nietzsche 2001 [1886]: 186; original emphases). In this passage, Nietzsche simultaneously recognizes the variance in moralities and posits patterns within the variance. Such patterns are liable to arise because we often face trade-offs among our values. These trade-offs can be individual or social, synchronic or diachronic. I can't satisfy all of my needs and cultivate all of my capabilities simultaneously. Even over the course of a lucky and well-lived life, no one manages to fulfil all of their sometimes-competing values. And of course, satisfying one person's needs can make it more difficult to satisfy another person's needs. If I eat all the food, you may go hungry. Game theory is a mathematical abstraction that enables us to model these sorts of trade-off. In particular, the study of non-zero-sum games, in which one person's benefit needn't always come at another person's cost, helps us to think about relationships and encounters in which it's possible for both or all parties to benefit simultaneously. These are the sorts of relationship and encounter in which co-operation is possible, and it is here that the hypothesis of morality-as-co-operation comes into play. In particular, the MAC hypothesis holds that the function of morality is to help people to find, and motivate them to enact, co-operative solutions whenever possible. What I take Curry, Mullins, and Whitehouse (2019) to have shown is closely connected to these claims. They argue that there are seven pillars of morality: family values, group loyalty, reciprocity, hawkish heroism, dovish deference, fairness, and property. Each of these moral elements helps us to negotiate trade-offs in values that are endemic to the human condition, which is why they are associated with well-studied non-zero-sum games. Such games sometimes have multiple equilibria, which helps to explain why different solutions are visible or prominent in different communities. In addition, the exact implementation of an abstractly characterized solution can differ from group to group and within groups over time. What all solutions must do, however, is help those who play the game to pursue, promote, and protect their values. In other words, these solutions are

TITLE: Elements in the C terminus of apolipoprotein [a] responsible for the binding to the tenth type III module of human fibronectin
ABSTRACT: In previous studies, we showed that the C-terminal domain, F2, but not the N-terminal domain, F1, is responsible for the binding of apolipoprotein [a] (apo[a]) to human fibronectin (Fn). To pursue those observations, we prepared, by both elastase digestion and recombinant technology, subsets of F2 of a different length containing either kringle (K) V or the protease domain (PD). We also studied rhesus monkey apo[a], which is known to contain PD but not KV. In the case of Fn, we used both an intact product and its tenth type III module (10FN-III) expressed in Escherichia coli. The binding studies carried out on microtiter plates showed that the affinity of F2 for immobilized 10FN-III was ∼6-fold higher than that for Fn (dissociation constants = 1.75 ± 0.31 nM and 10.25 ± 1.62 nM, respectively). The binding was also exhibited by rhesus apo[a] and by an F2 subset containing the PD linked to an upstream microdomain comprising KIV-8 to KIV-10 and KV, inactive by itself. Competition experiments on microtiter plates showed that both Fn and 10FN-III, when in solution, are incompetent to bind F2.Together, our results indicate that F2 binds to immobilized 10FN-III more efficiently than whole Fn and that the binding can be sustained by truncated forms of F2 that contain the catalytically inactive PD linked to an upstream four K microdomain. In previous studies, we showed that the C-terminal domain, F2, but not the N-terminal domain, F1, is responsible for the binding of apolipoprotein [a] (apo[a]) to human fibronectin (Fn). To pursue those observations, we prepared, by both elastase digestion and recombinant technology, subsets of F2 of a different length containing either kringle (K) V or the protease domain (PD). We also studied rhesus monkey apo[a], which is known to contain PD but not KV. In the case of Fn, we used both an intact product and its tenth type III module (10FN-III) expressed in Escherichia coli. The binding studies carried out on microtiter plates showed that the affinity of F2 for immobilized 10FN-III was ∼6-fold higher than that for Fn (dissociation constants = 1.75 ± 0.31 nM and 10.25 ± 1.62 nM, respectively). The binding was also exhibited by rhesus apo[a] and by an F2 subset containing the PD linked to an upstream microdomain comprising KIV-8 to KIV-10 and KV, inactive by itself. Competition experiments on microtiter plates showed that both Fn and 10FN-III, when in solution, are incompetent to bind F2. Together, our results indicate that F2 binds to immobilized 10FN-III more efficiently than whole Fn and that the binding can be sustained by truncated forms of F2 that contain the catalytically inactive PD linked to an upstream four K microdomain. Fibronectin (Fn) is a large (450 kDa) multidomain protein that interacts with a variety of macromolecules, including components of the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix and cell surface receptors particularly of fibroblasts, neurons, macrophages, and bacteria (1Schwarzbauer J.E. Alternative splicing of fibronectin: three variants, three functions.Bioassays. 1991; 13: 527-533Google Scholar). Fn occurs in two main forms: one is insoluble, exhibiting adhesive properties, and is synthesized by fibroblasts, chondrocytes, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and macrophages; the other is soluble, a heterodimer present in the plasma, and is synthesized by hepatocytes. In both forms there are three internally homologous repeats, called modules (types I, II, and III), that are readily separable by the action of proteolytic enzymes and exhibiting various binding motifs (2Hynes R.O. The molecular biology of fibronectin.Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 67-85Google Scholar). In human soluble Fn, there are 12 type I, 2 type II, and 15 type III modules, each module representing independently folded units containing mostly β sheets and turns (Fig. 1). The first two modules contain four conserved cysteines comprising two disulfide bonds that are critical for module stability and function. In turn, type III modules are devoid of disulfide bonds because the two unpaired cysteines are buried (3Baron M. Norman D.G. Campbell I.D. Protein modules.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 13-17Google Scholar, 4Potts J.R. Campbell I.D. Fibronectin structure and assembly.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 648-655Google Scholar). Although Fn is present in early atherosclerotic lesions and in atherosclerotic plaques, its overall role in the atherosclerotic process is unclear (5Wight T.N. The Vascular Extracellular Matrix.in: Fuster V. Topol E.J. Nabel E.G. Atherothrombosis and Coronary Heart Disease. Lippincott Williams & Williams, Philadelphia, PA2005: 421-437Google Scholar). Salonen et al. (6Salonen E-M. Jauhiainen M. Zardi L. Vaheri A. Ehnholm C. Lipoprotein(a) binds to fibronectin and has serine proteinase activity capable of cleaving it.EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4035-4040Google Scholar) were the first to show that lipoprotein [a] (Lp[a]) binds, via apolipoprotein [a] (apo[a]), to immobilized Fn using preparations isolated from human plasma. Moreover, by studying thermolysin digests of Fn, they observed that the strongest binding involved the C-terminal heparin binding 29 kDa fragment. Binding of apo[a] to immobilized Fn was also reported by van der Hoek et al. (7van der Hoek Y.Y. Sangrar W. Cote G.P. Kastelein J.P. Koschinsky M.L. Binding of recombinant apolipoprotein(a) to extracellular matrix proteins.Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1792-1798Google Scholar), who used Fn isolated from human plasma and a recombinant apo[a]. The binding on Fn was located to a 12 amino acid sequence in the N-terminal region of the overlapping 29–38 kDa thermolysin fragments. These two previous studies did not rule out the possibility that in its immobilized form, Fn has additional binding sites for apo[a]. Moreover, they did not provide information on the site(s) on apo[a] involved in the binding. In this context, we previously showed that the C-terminal domain of apo[a], referred to as F2, is critical for the binding of apo[a] to Fn (8Scanu A.M. Edelstein C. Klezovitch O. Dominant role of the C-terminal domain of apolipoprotein(a) to the protein core of proteoglycans and other members of the extracellular matrix.Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 9: 196-200Google Scholar). This domain comprises kringle (K) IV types 5–10, one copy of KV, and the protease domain (PD) (9Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. Functional and metabolic differences between elastase-generated fragments of human lipoprotein[a] and apolipoprotein[a].J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Google Scholar, 10Scanu A.M. Edelstein C. Kringle-dependent structural and functional polymorphism of apolipoprotein (a).Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 1-12Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). This PD has a high degree of homology with that of plasminogen; however, unlike the latter, it is inactive as a result of the presence of serine instead of arginine at the site of activation by tissue plasminogen activator (11McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. cDNA sequence of human apolipoprotein(a) is homologous to plasminogen.Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Google Scholar) and possibly because of the influence of the deletion of a nonapeptide (present in plasminogen) between residues 4,483 and 4,491 of the apo[a] sequence (12Gabel B.R. Koschinsky M.L. Analysis of the proteolytic activity of a recombinant form of apolipoprotein(a).Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15777-15784Google Scholar). The significance of this inactive protease in apo[a] has not been determined, and questions have been raised regarding possible enzyme-unrelated activities. The current studies were carried out to define the elements in F2 responsible for the binding of apo[a] to Fn. For this purpose, we used a series of truncated products obtained by either proteolytic digestion of naturally occurring human apo[a] or recombinant technology, an approach that we have found useful in investigating the complex structure-function relationships in Lp[a] (13Scanu A.M. Edelstein C. Learning about the structure and biology of human lipoprotein [a] through dissection by enzymes of the elastase family: facts and speculations.J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2193-2206Google Scholar). In our binding systems, besides intact Fn, we also used the tenth type III module (10FN-III) that in preliminary studies in human carotid artery plaques was found to be associated with apo[a] (A. M. Scanu et al., unpublished observation). Here, we provide evidence that this module, known to participate in a number of cell adhesion events, is involved in the binding of Fn to human apo[a] and that in the latter case, the PD is a necessary but not sufficient element in the binding. Fn was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Human leukocyte elastase (EC 3.4.21.37), BSA, Tween 20, 2-mercaptoethanol, SDS, diiopropylfluorophosphate, ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA), goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugates, rabbit affinity-purified anti-human Fn, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate were all purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Kallikrein inactivator was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Rabbit affinity-purified antibodies to apo[a] were prepared as described previously (14Fless G.M. Snyder M.L. Scanu A.M. Enzyme-linked immunoassay for Lp[a].J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 651-662Google Scholar). Anti-apo[a] did not react against either LDL or plasminogen. A monoclonal antibody against a recombinant human apo[a] KV was a gift from Abbott Laboratories (Abbott Park, IL), and its specificity was verified in our laboratory. All chemicals were of reagent grade. The subjects used for the preparation of Lp[a] were healthy donors with plasma Lp[a] protein levels in the range of 15–43 mg/dl with a known apo[a] phenotype. Their plasma was obtained by plasmapheresis performed in the blood bank at the University of Chicago. All of the subjects in the study gave written informed consent according to protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Chicago. The steps for Lp[a] isolation were carried out immediately after blood drawing using a combination of ultracentrifugation and lysine-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described previously (15Fless G.M. Snyder M.L. Furbee J.W.J. Garcia-Hedo M.T. Mora R. Subunit composition of lipoprotein(a) protein.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13492-13501Google Scholar). For the current study, we used Lp[a] having 15 type IV Ks. In those subjects having two apo[a] isoforms, the Lp[a] species containing the desired isoform was separated from the other by CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation as described (15Fless G.M. Snyder M.L. Furbee J.W.J. Garcia-Hedo M.T. Mora R. Subunit composition of lipoprotein(a) protein.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13492-13501Google Scholar). Apo[a] was isolated from Lp[a] essentially as described by Edelstein et al. (16Edelstein C. Mandala M. Pfaffinger D. Scanu A.M. Determinants of lipoprotein(a) assembly: a study of wild-type and mutant apolipoprotein(a) phenotypes isolated from human and rhesus monkey lipoprotein(a) under mild reductive conditions.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16483-16492Google Scholar) in the presence of 1.25 mM dithioerythreitol. Apo[a] phenotyping was performed on plasma samples by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using a monospecific anti-human apo[a] antibody. The mobility of the individual apo[a] bands was compared with that of isolated apo[a] isoforms of known molecular weights, and the number of Ks was compared with those provided by Dr. Angles-Cano (Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale Unit 143, Paris, France). Lp[a] was isolated from rhesus plasma as described previously (17Scanu A.M. Miles L.A. Fless G.M. Pfaffinger D. Eisenbart J. Jackson E. Hooverplow J.L. Brunck T. Plow E.F. Rhesus monkey lipoprotein(a) binds to lysine Sepharose and U937 monocytoid cells less efficiently than human lipoprotein(a). Evidence for the dominant role of kringle 4(37).J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 283-291Google Scholar). Apo[a] was separated from Lp[a] by the same techniques used for the human Lp[a] and had an apparent mass of 325 kDa. We have shown previously that both products are recognized by the human antibodies (17Scanu A.M. Miles L.A. Fless G.M. Pfaffinger D. Eisenbart J. Jackson E. Hooverplow J.L. Brunck T. Plow E.F. Rhesus monkey lipoprotein(a) binds to lysine Sepharose and U937 monocytoid cells less efficiently than human lipoprotein(a). Evidence for the dominant role of kringle 4(37).J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 283-291Google Scholar). A schematic representation of the apo[a] fragments used in our studies is shown in Fig. 2. Human leukocyte elastase (1 unit = 1 nm p-nitrophenol/s from N-1 T-butyloxycarbonyl-L-Ala p-nitrophenol ester) was diluted 1,000-fold in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 8.0. One microliter of the diluted enzyme was incubated per 15 μg of apo[a] at 37°C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated with 5 mM diiopropylfluorophosphate for 20 min at 22°C. The purification of the fragments was carried out as described previously, and each fragment gave a single band on SDS-PAGE (18Klezovitch O. Edelstein C. Scanu A.M. Stimulation of interleukin-8 production in human THP-1 macrophages by apolipoprotein(a): evidence for a critical involvement of elements of its C-terminal domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46864-46869Google Scholar). The fragments behaved as monomers when examined by sedimentation velocity in the analytical ultracentrifuge. The rIII recombinant protein lacking KIV-6, -7, -8, and PD (6KΔKIV6-8ΔPD) was prepared by digesting the 6 K expression plasmid with ClaI and EcoRV (19Edelstein C. Pfaffinger D. Hinman J. Miller E. Lipkind G. Tsimikas S. Bergmark C. Getz G.S. Witztum J.L. Scanu A.M. Lysine-phosphatidylcholine adducts in kringle V impart unique immunological and potential pro-inflammatory properties to human apolipoprotein(a).J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 26: 52841-52847Google Scholar). Subsequently, the 2.4 kb ClaI-EcoRV insert was subjected to digestion with BamHI to remove the BamHI-BamHI internal DNA domains coding for apo[a] KIV-6 through -8. The 0.32 kb ClaI-BamHI and the 1.03 kb BamHI-EcoRV DNA fragments were then ligated back into the 6 K expression plasmid that was digested with ClaI and EcoRV (vector part). rIII (6KΔKIV6-8ΔPD) (Fig. 3)was sequenced and transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The clone produced significant amounts of recombinant product (0.5–10 mg/l of the culture medium) that was purified by lysine-Sepharose chromatography. The recombinant product, 10FN-III, was the tenth unit of the human Fn type III domain containing 96 amino acids (Fig. 1). The steps involved in the gene construction, phage display, expression in Escherichia coli, and purification of 10FN-III from cell culture medium were described previously (20Koide A. Bailey C.W. Huang X. Koide S. The fibronectin type III domain as a scaffold for novel binding proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1141-1151Google Scholar). By SDS-PAGE, it migrated as a single band in the expected position (Fig. 4). Sedimentation velocity experiments were conducted using the Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Approximately 0.4 mg/ml 10FN-III in TBS was placed in a two sector centerpiece and centrifuged at 60,000 rpm for 15 h at 22°C. The data were analyzed using SEDFIT (21Schuck P. Size-distribution analysis of macromolecules by sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation and Lamm equation modeling.Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Google Scholar). A single symmetrical peak was observed with an apparent molecular weight of 10,400. All binding experiments were conducted at room temperature. Microtiter plates (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) were coated with 100 μl of either Fn or 10FN-III, each at 10 μg/ml, in TBS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl) for 24 h. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% BSA in TBS for 1.5 h. After three washes with TBST (TBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 0.02% Tween 20), various concentrations of either apo[a] or apo[a] fragments were added to the wells in TBS buffer and incubated for 2 h. After incubation, the wells were washed three times with TBST. The bound protein was detected using a monospecific polyclonal anti-apo[a] antibody in TBST for 1 h. In the specific case of fragment F7 (KV-PD), a monoclonal anti-KV antibody was used because this fragment was not recognized by our anti-apo[a] antibody. At this time, the wells were washed three times with TBST, and goat anti-rabbit IgG, or in the case of KV-PD, anti-mouse IgG, both conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, were added for 1 h. After washing with TBST, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (1 mg/ml in diethanolamine buffer, pH 9.8) was added, and the color development was followed at 405 nm on a Versamax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). In another set of experiments, we coated the wells with apo[a] and after washing the excess we examined the binding of either Fn or 10FN-III using a polyclonal antibody specific for human Fn. Analysis of the binding data was performed on the assumption of single-site binding. Dissociation constants (Kd) were derived using the program Origin version 7.03 (Origin Lab Co., Northhampton, MA) fitting the data to a one-site model represented by the equation [Y]=B[X](K+[X])where [Y] represents the absorbance at 405 nm, which is proportional to the amount of ligand bound; [X] represents the concentration of free ligand; B represents the maximum absorbance at saturation; and K represents the association constant. In some experiments, a constant amount (50 nM) of either apo[a] or fragments was incubated with immobilized Fn in the presence of various concentrations of EACA (0–200 mM) or NaCl (0–2 M). After incubation for 1 h, the bound protein was detected with anti-apo[a] antibody or anti-KV antibody, as described above, depending on the protein under study. A range of concentrations of either 10FN-III or Fn were mixed with 50 nM apo[a] or in some cases a range of apo[a] concentrations and incubated in wells of microtiter plates coated with Fn or 10FN-III. Bound apo[a] was detected using a monospecific anti-apo[a] antibody. The secondary antibody and color development reaction were as described above. Lp[a] protein was quantified by a sandwich ELISA as described previously (14Fless G.M. Snyder M.L. Scanu A.M. Enzyme-linked immunoassay for Lp[a].J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 651-662Google Scholar). The concentration of apo[a] was determined either by ELISA or using an extinction coefficient (e278 = 1.31 ml/mg/cm) established previously (22Edelstein C. Italia J.I. Scanu A.M. Polymorphonuclear cells isolated from human peripheral blood cleave lipoprotein(a) and apolipoprotein(a) at multiple interkringle sites via the enzyme elastase: generation of mini Lp(a) particles and apo(a) fragments.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11079-11087Google Scholar) for apo[a]. Protein concentrations of the fragments were determined by the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. As shown in Fig. 5A, apo[a] bound in a saturable manner. The apparent Kd value was 10.25 ± 1.62 nM (Table 1). To determine which portion of apo[a] was responsible for this binding, we examined F1 and F2, the N- and C-terminal fragments, respectively, generated by limited digestion of apo[a] with leukocyte elastase (Fig. 2). F2 bound in a saturable manner, whereas F1 exhibited no detectable binding (Fig. 5, Table 1). Concentrations of EACA up to 200 mM or NaCl up to 2 M had no effect on the binding of either apo[a] or F2 (data not shown), suggesting a hydrophobic mode of interaction. These results indicated that F2 has the necessary elements for binding to Fn and that this binding was stronger when F2 was an integral part of apo[a], suggesting an enhancing effect by the attached F1.TABLE 1Summary of the binding parameter Kd of apo[a] and fragments to immobilized Fn and 10FN-IIISampleFn10FN-IIInMApo[a], 15 kringle IV10.25 ± 1.62 (6)1.75 ± 0.31 (3)F228.75 ± 6.10 (4)5.64 ± 0.46 (3)F432.16 ± 1.91 (3)15.16 ± 1.57 (4)Rhesus apo[a]7.72 ± 0.26 (3)3.42 ± 0.62 (3)apo[a], apolipoprotein [a]; Fn, fibronectin; 10FN-III, tenth type III module of fibronectin; Kd, dissociation constant.

Open table in a new tab apo[a], apolipoprotein [a]; Fn, fibronectin; 10FN-III, tenth type III module of fibronectin; Kd, dissociation constant. Kd was calculated by fitting the data from replicate experiments globally to a one-site model as described in Methods. The data shown are means ± SEM. The numbers of independent experiments conducted in triplicate are shown in parentheses. To define the region within F2 responsible for the binding to Fn, we studied the elastase digests of apo[a] shown in Fig. 2. Only F4 (KIV-8, -9, -10, KV, and PD) bound, whereas F3 (KIV-5, -6, -7, -8, -9, -10), F5 (KIV-8, -9, -10), and F6 (KIV-5, -6, -7) were inactive (Fig. 5B). These results suggested that either KV or PD or both were participants in the binding. To resolve this issue, we used the recombinant protein rIII, containing KIV-9, -10, and KV but not the PD. We found that rIII exhibited no binding (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the PD is important for the binding of apo[a] to Fn. To corroborate this conclusion, we used apo[a] isolated from rhesus Lp[a]. This nonhuman primate apo[a] is structurally similar to human apo[a] but lacks KV. As shown in Fig. 5C, the binding of this apo[a] to Fn was comparable to that of its human counterpart, with apparent Kd values of 7.72 ± 0.26 nM and 10.25 ± 1.62 nM, respectively (Table 1). We next tested the small fragment, F7 (KV-PD), for its ability to bind to Fn. For detection, we used, as a primary antibody, a monoclonal antibody directed against KV after establishing that it was suited to recognize both KV-PD and apo[a]. We observed binding with apo[a] but not with KV-PD (Fig. 5D). Together, all of the information gathered provided evidence that the PD required upstream sequences longer than KV for Fn binding, In these studies, we coated the wells of the microtiter plates with 10FN-III. As shown in Fig. 6, human apo[a], rhesus apo[a], F2, and F4 exhibited binding, whereas F1 did not. In all cases, the binding affinity to 10FN-III was markedly higher than that exhibited by Fn. This was particularly true for apo[a] and F2, which exhibited a 5- to 6-fold difference from the data obtained with Fn (Table 1). To assess the ability of apo[a] to bind Fn in solution, we coated the microtiter plates with Fn at 10 μg/ml and then incubated the wells with solutions containing variable amounts (0–80 μg/ml) of Fn and a constant amount (50 nM) of apo[a]. As shown in Fig. 7, when in the solution phase, Fn was unable to compete for the binding of apo[a]. Similar results were observed for 10FN-III. In addition, in a system in which apo[a] was coated on microtiter plates at 10 μg/ml or 45 nM, binding of either Fn or 10FN-III was not observed (data not shown). The current studies have identified five elements in the C terminus of F2 that together were required for the binding of human apo[a] to immobilized Fn. Of these, the PD proved to be necessary but not sufficient for binding, given the need for the three upstream Ks, KIV-8 to -10, which by themselves were functionally inert. This conclusion is based on the combined results summarized in Fig. 5 obtained by studying proteolytic digests of apo[a] and recombinant products. KV was not required based on the results with the truncated products and those for rhesus monkey apo[a], which is known to contain PD but not KV (23Tomlinson J. McLean J. Lawn R. Rhesus monkey apolipoprotein(a).J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5957-5965Google Scholar), that proved to be as effective as a human counterpart in binding Fn. Our conclusion is also in keeping with the lack of binding exhibited by the small KV-PD unit. With reference to the type of binding, the lack of effect by EACA suggests a lysine-independent mode despite the fact that the PD, a 236 amino acid residue structure, contains 14 of the 23 lysines present in the whole apo[a]. Of note, the PD, although containing the histidine/asparagine/serine triad, a requisite for serine protease activity, is catalytically inactive because the arginine required for cleavage by tissue plasminogen activator is replaced by serine (11McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. cDNA sequence of human apolipoprotein(a) is homologous to plasminogen.Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Google Scholar) and possibly also because of conformational issues relating to the nine amino acid deletion in the PD (12Gabel B.R. Koschinsky M.L. Analysis of the proteolytic activity of a recombinant form of apolipoprotein(a).Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15777-15784Google Scholar). It is unclear whether this catalytic inactivity has meaning regarding Fn binding. In this regard, plasminogen, which is highly homologous to apo[a] and has a catalytically active PD (11McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. cDNA sequence of human apolipoprotein(a) is homologous to plasminogen.Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Google Scholar), has been shown to bind to Fn via a lysine-dependent mechanism (6Salonen E-M. Jauhiainen M. Zardi L. Vaheri A. Ehnholm C. Lipoprotein(a) binds to fibronectin and has serine proteinase activity capable of cleaving it.EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4035-4040Google Scholar, 7van der Hoek Y.Y.

Thromb. 1994; 14: 1792-1798Google Scholar), indicating a mode of Fn binding divergent from that of apo[a]. The other novel finding of our work is the identification of the tenth type III module, referred to as 10FN-III, as a major site on Fn involved in apo[a] binding. This is an interesting model from a structural standpoint in that it represents a relatively small monomeric unit, one of the few members of the immunoglobulin superfamily with no disulfide bonds (3Baron M. Norman D.G. Campbell I.D. Protein modules.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 13-17Google Scholar, 4Potts J.R. Campbell I.D. Fibronectin structure and assembly.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 648-655Google Scholar). Moreover, the three-dimensional structure of 10FN-III has been determined by NMR (24Main A.L. Harvey T.S. Baron M. Boyd J. Campbell I.D. The three dimensional structure of the tenth type III module of fibronectin: an insight into RGD-mediated interactions.Cell. 1992; 71: 671-678Google Scholar) and X-ray crystallography (25Dickinson C.D.

Erickson H.P. Palmer A.G.R. Backbone dynamics of homologous fibronectin type III cell adhesion domains from fibronectin and tenascin.Structure. 1997; 5: 949-959Google Scholar) are also well established. The structure is best described as a β-sandwich with seven β-strands containing the integrin binding RGD sequence involved in cell adhesion (24Main A.L. Harvey T.S. Baron M. Boyd J. Campbell I.D. The three dimensional structure of the tenth type III module of fibronectin: an insight into RGD-mediated interactions.Cell. 1992; 71: 671-678Google Scholar). Among the already established properties of 10FN-III, we now show that it also binds to critical elements of the C-terminal domain of apo[a]. It remains to be established which site(s) on 10FN-III are responsible for apo[a] binding. In previous studies, van der Hoek et al. (7van der Hoek Y.Y. Sangrar W. Cote G.P. Kastelein J.P. Koschinsky M.L. Binding of recombinant apolipoprotein(a) to extracellular matrix proteins.Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1792-1798Google Scholar) identified a 12 amino acid sequence in Fn involved in the binding to a recombinant form of apo[a]. As for 10FN-III, the binding was not lysine-mediated and was unaffected by high salt concentrations. According to the published data on Fn, the sequence reported by van der Hoek et al. (7van der Hoek Y.Y. Sangrar W. Cote G.P. Kastelein J.P. Koschinsky M.L. Binding of recombinant apolipoprotein(a) to extracellular matrix proteins.Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1792-1798Google Scholar) is located downstream of 10FN-III in the junction between the 11th and 12th modules (29Kornblihtt A.R. Umezawa K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Baralle F.E. Primary structure of human fibronectin: differential splicing may generate at least 10 polypeptides from a single gene.EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1755-1759Google Scholar). This site was identified by submitting soluble Fn to thermolysin digestion followed by a trypsin step resulting in the unmasking of a site buried in undigested Fn. It is difficult to compare those data with ours because the authors neither provided quantitative binding parameters nor identified the elements in the recombinant apo[a] used. Overall, we believe that our current results make a strong case for 10FN-III being a major site for apo[a] binding. This conclusion is corroborated by the observation that the binding affinity of this module was 6-fold higher than that exhibited by the whole Fn, suggesting that in the intact molecule the binding site on 10FN-III is partially buried. Past studies from this laboratory have underscored the value of proteolytic dissection in the investigation of the structure and biology of Lp[a] (13Scanu A.M. Edelstein C. Learning about the structure and biology of human lipoprotein [a] through dissection by enzymes of the elastase family: facts and speculations.J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2193-2206Google Scholar, 22Edelstein C. Italia J.I. Scanu A.M. Polymorphonuclear cells isolated from human peripheral blood cleave lipoprotein(a) and apolipoprotein(a) at multiple interkringle sites via the enzyme elastase: generation of mini Lp(a) particles and apo(a) fragments.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11079-11087Google Scholar). Since then, the use of proteolytically derived fragments alone or in combination with recombinant products has provided and is continuing to provide evidence for the structural heterogeneity of apo[a] associated with a functional diversity in which Ks play an important role. For instance, KIV-9, which is known to be engaged in disulfide linkage with the C-terminal domain of apolipoprotein B-100 (11McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. cDNA sequence of human apolipoprotein(a) is homologous to plasminogen.Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Google Scholar), was implicated recently in the stimulating action of apo[a] on the migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (30O'Neil C.H. Boffa M.B. Hancock M.A. Pickering J.G. Koschinsky M.L. Stimulation of vascular smooth cell proliferation and migration by apolipoprotein(a) is dependent on inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta activation and on the presence of kringle IV type 9.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55187-55195Google Scholar). KIV-10 contains the high-affinity lysine binding site important for critical apo[a] functions (31Scanu A.M. Fless G.M. Lipoprotein (a): heterogeneity and biological relevance.J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1709-1715Google Scholar), whereas KV-5 to -8 contain some lysine residues that are linked covalently to oxidized phospholipids that appear to impart a proinflammatory function to apo[a] (19Edelstein C. Pfaffinger D. Hinman J. Miller E. Lipkind G. Tsimikas S. Bergmark C. Getz G.S. Witztum J.L. Scanu A.M. Lysine-phosphatidylcholine adducts in kringle V impart unique immunological and potential pro-inflammatory properties to human apolipoprotein(a).J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 26: 52841-52847Google Scholar). Moreover, a recombinant form of KV has been reported to exhibit an antiangiogenic function (32Kim J-S. Yu H-K. Ahn J-H. Lee H-J. Hong S-W. Jung H-H. Chang S-I. Hong Y-K. Joe Y-A. Byun S-M. et al.Human apolipoprotein(a) kringle V inhibits angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo by interfering with the activation of focal adhesion kinases.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 534-540Google Scholar). Very recently in mouse models, the KIV-5 to -8 peptide was implicated in the delayed chylomicron remnant removal from the plasma and also immunochemically identified in the atherosclerotic area of the aortic root examined (33Devlin C.M. Lee S-J. Kuriakose G. Spencer C. Becker L. Grosskopf I. Ko C. Huang L-S. Koschinsky M. Cooper A.D. et al.An apolipoprotein(a) peptide delays chylomicron remnant clearance and increases plasma remnant lipoproteins and atherosclerosis in vivo.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 1704-1710Google Scholar). The PD has received relatively little attention, being functionally inert from an enzymatic standpoint, although recently it was shown to be one of the elements involved in the binding of human apo[a] to fibrinogen (34Xue S. Madison E.L. Miles L.A. The Kringle V-protease domain is a fibrinogen binding region within human apo(a).Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 1229-1237Google Scholar). Our current studies now provide evidence that in apo[a], the PD plays a role in the binding of human apo[a] to Fn, but only in cooperation with at least four Ks located upstream. The current studies also bring attention to the fact that both Fn and 10FN-III bind to apo[a] when immobilized but not in solution. This observation, which in the case of Fn is in keeping with previous studies by Salonen et al. (6Salonen E-M. Jauhiainen M. Zardi L. Vaheri A. Ehnholm C. Lipoprotein(a) binds to fibronectin and has serine proteinase activity capable of cleaving it.EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4035-4040Google Scholar), is not unique to the Fn-apo[a] system, because immobilization of Fn has been shown to be required for the binding of Fn to plasminogen, tissue-type plasminogen activator (35Salonen E-M. Saksela O. Vartio T. Vaheri A. Nielsen L.S. Zeuthen J. Plasminogen and tissue-type plasminogen activator binds to immobilized fibronectin.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12302-12307Google Scholar), and acute-phase C-reactive protein (36Salonen E-M. Vartio T. Hedman K. Vaheri A. Binding of fibronectin to the acute phase-reactant C-reactive protein.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1496-1514Google Scholar). In this regard, recent studies have shown that Fn undergoes a conformational transition from a closed form to an open form when moving from a solution to a solid phase (37Halter M. Antia M. Vogel V. Fibronectin conformational changes induced by adsorption to liposomes.J. Control. Release. 2005; 101: 209-222Google Scholar, 38Kowalczyñska H.M. Norwak-Wyrzykowska M. Kolos R. Dobkowski J. Kamiñski J. Fibronectin adsorption and arrangement on copolymer surfaces and their significance in cell adhesion.J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 2005; 72A: 228-236Google Scholar). Noteworthy, this notion explains why Fn and apo[a] do not interact with each other in the circulating plasma. Regarding the biological relevance of the current findings, we have previously shown that apo[a], via F2, binds to fibrinogen and to the protein core of the proteoglycans decorin and biglycan (8Scanu A.M. Edelstein C. Klezovitch O. Dominant role of the C-terminal domain of apolipoprotein(a) to the protein core of proteoglycans and other members of the extracellular matrix.Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 9: 196-200Google Scholar); in addition, we confirmed the critical role of F2 in this binding by subjecting it to limited proteolysis (either pancreatic elastase or metalloproteinase-12), and apo[a] bound to either decorin, biglycan, or Fn immobilized onto microtiter plates (39Scanu A.M. Chellamma S. Cleavage of human apolipoprotein(a) coated on the surface of constituents of the vascular extracellular matrix by pancreatic elastase and metalloproteinase-12. Different partitions between cleaved N-terminal and C-terminal domains.Vascular Disease Prevention. 2004; 1: 59-63Google Scholar). Moreover, we have observed that F2 undergoes further fragmentation under more extensive proteolytic conditions (22Edelstein C. Italia J.I. Scanu A.M. Polymorphonuclear cells isolated from human peripheral blood cleave lipoprotein(a) and apolipoprotein(a) at multiple interkringle sites via the enzyme elastase: generation of mini Lp(a) particles and apo(a) fragments.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11079-11087Google Scholar). Together, these results, in keeping with the lipoprotein retention hypothesis (40Williams K.J. Tabas I. The response-to retention hypothesis of early atherogenesis.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 551-561Google Scholar), suggest that the trapping by the vascular extracellular matrix elements favors the fragmentation of apo[a], the extent of which is dependent on the activity of the proteolytic enzymes, an expression of the chronic inflammatory milieu of the vessel wall. In this context, we recently provided evidence for an association between proteolytic activity and inflammation in plaques from endarterectomy segments of human carotid arteries and also showed the presence of fragments of apo[a], decorin, biglycan, versican (41Formato M. Farina M. Spirito R. Maggioni M. Guarino A. Cherchi G. Biglioli P. Edelstein C. Scanu A.M. Evidence for a proinflammatory and proteolytic environment in plaques from endarterectomy segments of human carotid arteries.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 129-135Google Scholar, 42Fortunato J.E. Bassiouny H.S. Song R.H. Kocharian H. Glagov S. Edelstein C. Scanu A.M. Apolipoprotein(a) fragments in relation to human carotid plaque instability.J. Vasc. Surg. 2000; 32: 555-563Google Scholar), and, more recently, Fn (A.M. Scanu et al., unpublished observations). In the latter case, we have identified the 10FN-III module associated with apo[a] using both immunohistochemical and immunoprecipitation techniques. The notion emerging from these findings is that in the inflammatory microenvironment of the atheromatous plaque, fragments of blood-derived lipoproteins become linked to elements of the extracellular matrix, generating entities likely exhibiting unique functions. For instance, apo[a] binding may affect the 10FN-III-mediated interactions of Fn regarding the atherosclerotic process; in turn, immobilized apo[a] would become more amenable to the action of proteolytic enzymes, generating some potentially bioactive fragments. The authors thank Dr. Shohei Koide of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Chicago for providing the recombinant 10FN-III module and for helpful discussions; the authors also thank Abbott Laboratories for the monoclonal antibody against human KV.

TITLE: Herbivory of a biocontrol agent on a native plant causes an indirect trait‐mediated non‐target effect on a native insect
ABSTRACT: Abstract Identifying food web linkages between biocontrol agents of invasive plants and native species is crucial for predicting indirect non‐target effects. Biocontrol insects can integrate into food webs within recipient habitats and influence native insects through apparent competition (altering shared natural enemies) or density‐mediated exploitation competition (changing density of native plants). However, whether and how trait‐mediated exploitation competition (modifying native plant chemicals and volatiles profiles) can produce indirect non‐target effects remains largely overlooked, despite plant phenotypic responses to insect herbivory being common and widely documented. The flea beetle Agasicles hygrophila was introduced into China for management of alligator weed Alternanthera philoxeroides, but it also attacks the native congener sessile joyweed Alternanthera sessilis, which may cause indirect non‐target effects on the native tortoise beetle Cassida piperata that also feeds on sessile joyweed. Here, we examined the relationships among abundances of the flea beetle and tortoise beetle, and coverage of sessile joyweed in the field. Then, we investigated the impact of flea beetle herbivory on tortoise beetle development and oviposition, as well as on sessile joyweed primary metabolites and leaf volatiles. Tortoise beetle abundance was not related to sessile joyweed coverage, but they were less abundant on plants with more flea beetles in the field survey, and produced fewer offspring on plants with more prior flea beetle damage in the field cage experiment. Tortoise beetle development was inhibited by prior flea beetle herbivory in bioassays in enemy‐free conditions and they preferred to oviposit on sessile joyweed that had experienced little or no flea beetle damage. Flea beetle herbivory decreased sessile joyweed foliar glucose and protein, and substantially changed its leaf volatile blend. Synthesis. Our results show that the flea beetle has major indirect non‐target effects on the tortoise beetle through trait‐mediated exploitation competition, rather than apparent competition or density‐mediated exploitation competition. Our results demonstrate a new example for indirect non‐target effects of biocontrol agents. Furthermore, our results indicate that minor brief negative impacts of biocontrol agents on non‐target plants might propagate to higher trophic levels and such negative impacts can strengthen with increasing intensity of the direct non‐target effect.

" fllustration £y Hiram Putnam Barnes. From Nathaniel Hawthorne. The House of the Seven Gables: A Romance (Philadelphia, HemyAltemus, 1892), pt. 2, p. 167, image facingp. 166. Different from Himself: Hawthorne and the Masks of Masculinity T. WALTER HERBERT A former generation of Hawthorne criticism, intent upon locating the "sweet moral blossom" that The Scarlet Letter promises at its outset, seized eagerly upon the following words near its close: "Among many morals which press upon us from the poor minister's miserable experience, we put only this into a sentence :-'Be true! Be true! Be true! Show freely to the world, if not your worst, yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred.' "1 Notice that this seemingly straightforward maxim reverses itself midcourse, when the logic driving its opening segment is replaced by its opposite. In the act of proposing the forthright self-disclosure that Dimmesdale never makes, the sentence recommends an equivocal self-disclosure that he makes again and again. Several traits-Dimmesdale's pallor, his emotionally overwrought preaching, the convulsive grasping at his bosom-make it easy for Chillingworth and the reader to infer the worst. So we are ushered into what our own generation of criticism defines as a paradigmatic Hawthornian moment, where self-revelation and self-concealment unite: the moral maxim unsays what it says. Comparable examples abound. When Coverdale reveals his love for Priscilla at the conclusion of The Blithedale Romance, he simultaneously reveals that there exists a body oftruth about Coverdale that the reader will never learn, all those missing elements ofthe narrative that would make that final disclosure make sense. As Hawthorne yields to the "autoESQ I v. 50 14TH QUARTER I2004 269 T. WALTER HERBERT biographical impulse" that seizes him at the outset ofthe "Custom - House" introduction, he underscores the concealment that accompanies self-declaration, pointedly drawing attention to "the inmost Me behind its veil" (GE, I: 3-4). Commenting on this persistent trait, David Leverenz notes that Hawthorne turns his readers into detectives-that students of his work from Herman Melville to Philip Young have convinced themselves there was some "secret" in Hawthorne's life, a bit of personal information that would clear up the mysteries, if onlywe could figure out what it is.~Was Hawthorne mortified by the incest trial of Anstice Manning, as Young proposes? Was he gay? Was he sexually abused in boyhood by his uncle Robert? Did he suffer lifelong from unresolved grief at the boyhood loss ofhis father?3 Unearthing further biographical information may cast light on these possibilities, or suggest others. Gordon Hutner introduces Secrets and ~mpatl:!Y, a study of Hawthorne's romances, by inviting the reader to resolve that "this alleged 'great secret' cannot be ascertained." He disengages the persistent Hawthornian theme from its presumptive biographical source, so as to pursue a telling investigation of Hawthorne's "rhetoric of secrecy" as a literary motif in itself, with strategic potentialities and deficiencies that playa central role in forming the world into which Hawthorne's writing takes us. Richard Millington's Practicing Romance likewise focuses on literary structure, yet issues of personal disclosure and secrecy enter powerfully into the definition of "romance" that Hawthorne is found to establish. In Noboqy's Home, ArnoldWeinstein similarly enlarges upon the thematics of secrecy as a constituent of genre, but in terms that reach well beyond Hawthorne. "The mythic project ofself-enactment," Weinstein argues, is a peculiarly Atnerican concern, pursued by a tradition of writers that extends from Hawthorne and Melville to Toni Morrison and Don DeLillo. He discusses Hawthorne's Wakefield as an archetype of this tradition, a protagonist who "experiences self as unreal, who appears spectral or 'fictive' both inwardly and outwardly. "4 This paper likewise takes up broadscale Atnerican issues, but concentrates attention on historical and psychosocial pro270 HAWTHORNE AND THE MASKS OF MASCUUNITY cesses that pervaded Hawthorne's personal experience and receive treatment in his writing. The ambivalences proliferating around self-revelation in Hawthorne arise significantly from what was commonplace in his experience, as distinct from any individual peculiarity, namely his compliance with an emerging culture of manhood whose inner contradictions haunted him. Hawthorne chronically fellt different from himself as he sought to perform the masquerade of middle-class masculinity.5 The gender ideology taking form in the early nineteenth century held that manliness is autonomous agency, that the character and career of a real man is fashioned by the man himself. Self-made men act with sovereign self-reliance, as Emerson proclaimed, unlike those whose bloodline advantage cripples them in the competition, or the self-enslaved at the bottom of the social scale. This ideology aided in creating an "imagined fraternity of white men" that claimed identification with the American nation itself, Dana Nelson has argued. 6 The ideal ofself-making served to conceal the gender and class privilege inherent in this "national manhood," as well as the systemic contradictions that entailed chronic tOJrID.ents for men like Hawthorne, who were privileged to live out the ideal. The publication of Twice-Told Tales (1837) first established Hawthorne in the seHhood he had devoted himself to creating, that of a major American writer. His well-·placed male friendships, as Jane Tompkins has demonstrated, helped to place him on this cultural stage. 7 Yet the machinery of privilege did not operate smoothly in Hawthorne's behalf; its workings provide a parable of the alienation of self from self that the ideal of self-making imposed. Leading characters in this masculine masquerade are the successful publisher Samuel Griswold Goodrich and Hawthorne's wealthy college friend Horatio Bridge, who played their parts in October of 1836. Goodrich had published several of Hawthorne's tales anonymously in The Token, gaining reputation as well as profit without any public recognition going to Hawthorne. But when Hawthorne approached him with the idea of bringing out a collection, Goodrich was uncooperative. Then Bridge offered Goodrich a guarantee against losses, but insisted that the offer 271 T. WALTER HERBERT be kept secret, for fear Hawthorne would refuse to accept such a favor from a friend. For Goodrich to back the project, by contrast, would be acceptable: he was a professional associate, ostensibly animated by his professional judgment of Hawthorne 's writing. Grateful for the apparent change of heart, Hawthorne now proposed to dedicate the volume to Goodrich. This dismayed Horatio Bridge, who had actually shown the generosity for which Goodrich was to be rewarded, and he set about dissuading Hawthorne from the proposed dedication, still without disclosing his own role. Goodrich's own selfish interests were well served by the deal, Bridge wrote. "There is no doubt in my mind of his selfishness in regard to your work and yourself.... [W] hen did he ever do anything for you without a quidpro quo ;'''8 From his position as Hawthorne's secret patron, Bridge hammered hOlne the Emersonian maxims. "The bane ofyour life has been self-distrust.... I wish to God that I could impart to you a little of my own brass. "9 This little comedy illuminates the pretense endemic to self-reliant masculinity. Bridge's help may serve as an emblem for the massive complex of unacknowledged, and often no more than half-recognized, assistance-from family and friends, women and other less fortunate men, both white and black-that was eclipsed by the ideology of self-making, and that supported Hawthorne lifelong. Men who conformed successfully to the ideal of masculine self-making were only distantly aware, if they were aware at all, of this interior contradiction. But Hawthorne was unable to achieve the necessary self-deception. He could not wholeheartedly believe in an identity he knew he had concocted. Knowing that the personhood he put in circulation had no backing apart from his own self-asserted self-sovereignty, Hawthorne felt like counterfeit coin. He lacked "brass," said Bridge: truer would be to say that he knew his brass was brass. The commonplace term-brass-betokens the commonplace subliminal uneasiness of ambitious entrepreneurial men in nineteenth-century America, that the self they put forward, and on which they relied to make their way among other such men, was a fiction. IO Hawthorne was acutely troubled by this dilemma during 272 HAWTHORNE AND THE MASKS OF MASCUUNITY the early years of writing in Salem, before any social confirmation of his authorial identity had taken place, and he was struggling to believe in the self he was trying to form. "Insincerity in a man's own heart," he wrote in his notebook, "makes all his enjoyments, all that concerns him, unreal; so that his whole life must seem like merely a dramatic representation. "II Receiving congratulations from HenryWadsworth Longfellow in 1837 for Twice-Told Tales did not banish Hawthorne's lingering horror of a "witchcraft" that had enmeshed his developing selfhood in unreality: "I have not lived," he told Longfellow, "but only dreamed about living" (OE, 15:251). At the end of his life, when Hawthorne was hailed internationally as a "classic " American writer, he was still enthralled by this "natural horror ofbeing a creature floating in the air, attached to nothing," and the feeling that "there is no reality in the life and fortunes, good or bad, ofa being so unconnected" (OE, 12:258). Hawthorne's inner distress over this predicament can be glimpsed in a daguerreotype image that survives from the tumultuous period that witnessed his emergence as a public figure, namely the months that extend from his troubles at the Salem customhouse to the publication of The Scarlet Letter. Although it is customarily dated "about 1848," the exact provenance of this remarkable image is not known. Hawthorne's friend John L. O'Sullivan had urged him some time earlier to have a daguerreotype made for purposes of "manufacturing [himself] thus into a Personage," and there is reason to believe that James T. Fields, who published The Scarlet Letter in 1850, paid for the daguerreotype in hopes it would be suitable for promoting the book.'2 The rigid, glaring image is unique in the gallery of Hawthorne portraits for the harsh inner turmoil it conveys, the struggle to attain self-confident self-possession all too apparent (see fig. I). Besieged by the demoralization that this conventional dilemma entailed, Hawthorne celebrated the conventional remedy for it. "Thou only hast revealed me to myself, " he wrote to Sophia Peabody (soon to be Sophia Hawthorne), "for without thy aid, my best knowledge of myself would have been merely to know my own shadow... and mistake its fantasies for my own real actions." Vesting Sophia with such powers, Hawthorne 273 FIfJ. 1. Nathaniel Hawthorne, around 184:8. Daguerreopype fry Whipple and Black. Courtesy of Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division, LC-USZ62-10992. HAWTHORNE AND THE MASKS OF MASCUUNITY transformed her into the domestic angel, who had spiritual force in the life of the antebellum self-made man because she counteracted the paralyzing self-distrust concealed behind his mask of masculinity. "We are not endowed with real life," Hawthorne explained, "and all that seems most real about us is but the thinnest substance of a dream-tin the heart is touched. That touch creates us-then we begin to be--therebywe are beings of reality" (CE, 15:495). The domestic angel redeemed the self-made man by believing in him as he wished to believe in himself, providing an intimate assurance that dispelled the nightmare of affectation and self-ignorance. Sophia's first knowledge of "Nathaniel Hawthorne" was mediated through a literary reputation that he had been excruciatingly anxious should not be marred by amateurish early efforts. Her power to make him real does not mean that he told her about his difficulties with Goodrich and ahout Bridge's role in them. She became Hawthorne's angel in part because she came to know him after he published Twice-Told Tales. The spiritual force of the domestic angel thus compounded the masculine masquerade, since the reality she underwrote was his unreality, the hction by which he wished to he known. Hawthorne had puhlished his first novel, Fanshawe, at his own expense in 1828., yet quickly determined that he needed to disown the hook-and asked his friends to return the copies he had sent them. He never came to regard this episode with indulgent humor, as a bout ofyouthful distress long since superseded. On the contrary, the repudiation of Fanshawe was an action essential to the lifelong strategy of his self-making; Sophia learned ahout it only after his death and refused at first to helieve such a hook had ever existed (CE, 3: 308-14). Hawthorne was different from himself even with Sophia, the guarantor of his heart's reality. The concealed self of the self-made man was not only an "inmost Me" pervaded by spiritual tremors that could he allayed through the sacred intimacy of marriage. It was a matter of professional strategy and financial arra:ngements: Sophia was startled when Nathaniel published his campaign biography of Franklin Pierce without showing her the manuscript. And it is highly unlikely she knew anything about the kickbacks to the 275 T. WALTER HERBERT Democratic Party that he had demanded of subordinates during his term at the customhouse.13 Dimmesdale's deception, likewise, follows from the requirements of his professional position, not from some inner necessity. 11111 The chronic dilemmas of masculine self-making take center stage in the The House ofthe Seven Gables, where forthright selfreliant manliness and outright hypocrisy converge to become indissolubly united. Jaffrey Pyncheon is made to represent "the sin oflong ago" (GE, 2: 41), but his career also exemplifies the opportunities and predicaments facing men in the anonymous public order brought into being by the urban capitalist society that emerged in the early nineteenth century. The "confidence man" was a mythic figure of this new environment, as Karen Halttunen has demonstrated in her study of the advice literature of the 1830s and 1840s that cautioned young men against placing their trust in plausible new acquaintances seeking to deceive them. For the "confidence man," the fictions of selfmaking induded deliberate fabrication and self-concealment, aimed at constructing and maintaining a negotiable public illusion, andJaffrey Pyncheon exemplifies the operations of such a figure in financial manipulations, political demagoguery, and interpersonal deceit.14 Pyncheon's acquisition of the family legacy has bankrolled a spectacular career of exploitative self-making. He has made a vast fortune on his own by investing in growth sectors of the antebellum economy, in railroads, banking, and insurance. Pyncheon enjoys an inner knowledge of the new financial systems, making it a custom to visit the "Insurance Office" so as to appraise the current gossip, and to drop "some deeply designed chance-word, which will be certain to become the gossip of tomorrow'" (GE, 2 :270). He creates pseudonymous bank accounts and employs other arcane methods, "familiar enough to capitalists" (GE, 2:234), by which the maze of financial institutions may be used to conceal his maneuvers. Pyneheon likewise exploits the new systems of patronage and publicity aimed at mobilizing mass electorates, securing 276 HAWTHORNE AND THE MASKS OF MASCUUNITY voters' support for political leaders they cannot know firsthand. Pyncheon's political contributions have purchased the support of men "skilled to adjust those preliminary measures, which steal from the people, without its knowledge, the power ofchoosing its own rulers" (CE, 2:274). He expects to be elected governor, but the election will be a sham, concealing the power of an economic oligarchy. And he is likewise skilled at performing the interpersonal gestures of the masculine masquerade. He has pursued his career of ruthless self-aggrandizement by projecting a carefully crafted image of harmless benevolence and unfailing warmth. Yet there has developed "a hidden stream of private talk" that tells the true story ofhis cruelty. Hawthorne declares that moral reality is to be found in "the woman's, the private and domestic view," and emphasizes the "vast discrepancy between portraits intended for engraving, and the pencil-sketches that pass from hand to hand, behind the original's back" (CE, 2:3IO, I22). The intimate spiritual authority of the domestic angel, by which she blesses the systematic self-deceptions of the selfmade, is confirmed by her ability to detect moral flaws that are invisible in the public world ofmen. Phoebe's aversion toJudge Pyncheon marks her as possessing the moral and religious touchstone that Hawthorne found in Sophia; without knowing any ofPyncheon's private story, she instinctively draws back from his gestures of affectionate kinship. Yet Pyncheon himselfis haunted by a partly conscious selfdisgust, so that the outward rebuffs that greet him strike home to an inner misery. In describing Pyncheon's benevolent smile, Hawthorne observes that it "was a good deal akin to the shine on his boots, and that each must have cost him and his bootblack, respectively, a good deal of hard labor to bring out and preserve"(CE, 2:II7). The menial toil that goes into keeping up the smile does not counteract simple malice, which smiles without being prompted; the black smile hides displeasure and inward pain. This blackness flows out of Pyncheon's being, "darkening forth" to fill his surroundings, and becomes the blackness of nonbeing as his dead face is engulfed in midnight: "The features are all gone; there is only the paleness of them left. And 277 T. WALTER HERBERT how looks it now?... There is no face! An infinite, inscrutable blackness has annihilated sight! Where is our universe?"(CE, 2:276). The desperation that enters the narrator's voice at this juncture indicates that the "darkness visible" into which Pyncheon dissolves is contagious; and the figure most susceptible to infection is his seeming opposite, Holgrave, who remains alone in the house with the body after he discovers it, making pictures and brooding over what Pyncheon's demise means for his own life. Hawthorne makes a decisive thematic investment in Holgrave as Pyncheon's opposite number, a wholly self-reliant man who takes pride in having no advantages of wealth and family position. His life-story echoes Emerson's praise for the seIfsufficient lad "who in turn tries all the professions... teams it, farms it, peddles, keeps a school. "'5 Holgrave too has a record ofad hoc enterprises-as schoolmaster, salesman, newspaper editor, peddler, and now as daguerreotypist. He has "never violated the innermost man," Hawthorne tells us, in "putting off one exterior, and snatching up another, to be soon shifted for a third" (CE, 2:I77). Yet the innermost man crumbles when Holgrave enters the gloom that surrounds Judge Pyncheon's demise, because the demon-ridden nonselfhood ofthe judge and the consummate self-reliance ofHoigrave are fundamentally akin. The assertedly self-made man is perforce a confidence man, who succeeds in "self-trust" insofar as he deceives himself and denies that his existence is conditioned by the vicissitudes and injustices of gender, class position, and economic happenstance. In desperation, Holgrave turns for spiritual solace to Phoebe, exclaiming, "the presence of yonder dead man threw a great black shadow over everything; he made the universe, so far as my perception could reach, a scene ofguilt, and ofretribution more dreadful than the guilt'" (CE, 2:306). Phoebe supplies the spiritual antidote to this nightmare as the two profess their love for each other and their intention to make a life together. "It was in this hour," Hawthorne comments, "so full of doubt and awe, that the one miracle was wrought, without which everyhuman existence is a blank" (CE, 2:307). Phoebe's profession oflove for Holgrave redeems him from 278 HAWTHORNE AND THE MASKS OF MASCUUNITY the masquerade of male self-sufficiency, yet also brings that masquerade to its consummation. The Holgrave that Phoebe loves is a man without consequential family background, pursuing his work as a daguerreotypist in the old Pyncheon house as just another happenstance. Holgrave's announcement that he is a member ofthe Maule family resembles Coverdale's disclosure of his love for Priscilla, revealing that we have hardly come to know this character at all; nothing we have learned means what it seems to have meant when we learned it. The prize for the confidence game Holgrave has been playing is Judge Pyncheon's fortune, to be obtained by marrying Phoebe. As she redeems his soul from the horrors of inner unreality, he relieves her of control over her inheritance. Hawthorne does not indict Holgrave as a fortune hunter, but he assembles circumstances that unmistakably frame such an indictment. In the very scene that centers on Pyncheon's dead body, Hawthorne has presented a procession of his deceased kinfolk, in which we learn that his only son is dead, so that the great estate is to devolve upon Hepzibah, Clifford, and Phoebe (GE, 2:280). Does one read the anxious rhetoric ofHolgrave's lovemaking without being subliminally aware that the judge's secret bank accounts, insurance shares, railroad holdings, and extensive real estate are all staked on the outcome? Holgrave does not reveal the false pretenses under which he has courted Phoebe, nor does the redemptive bliss that "makes all things true" prompt him to show his true colors. Holgrave mentions quite casually that Phoebe will be assuming the name of Maule when they marry, explaining that he would have disclosed his identity sooner, "only that [he] was afraid of frightening [her] away" (GE, 2:307, 316). Holgrave is simply not burdened by the practical deceptions entailed by his pursuit of self-made masculinity; instead he lavishes attention on the spiritual distresses ofhis inner life. The fate of Pyncheon causes him to view "the universe" as "a scene ofguilt, and ofretribution more dreadful than the guilt," but his own culpability does not come into the accounting. It is handsomely rewarded rather than punished. The interior conflicts of self-made manhood arise in good measure from the systematic exploitation of women, and of other subordi279 T. WALTER HERBERT nate contributors to the well-being that middle-class males claim as unaided achievements. The imaginative power of Hawthorne's work rests in good measure on his incessant probing at the interior contradictions and the emotional dilemmas generated by the ideology of self-making, but in settings that insistently (though often covertly) point outward toward the social conditions that give this self-canceling ideal its appearance of validity. "'Be true! Be true! Be true!'" never stands clear as a summary maxim; it is forever enmeshed in a set of moral failures and enigmas that make a self-made man different from himself. When Hawthorne yields to an autobiographical impulse, he perforce writes fiction. Southwestern Universi!y NOTES I.

TITLE: Endangered, apparently: the role of apparent competition in endangered species conservation
ABSTRACT: Abstract Conservation biologists have reported growing evidence of food‐web interactions as causes of species endangerment. Apparent competition is an indirect interaction among prey species mediated by a shared predator, and has been increasingly linked to declines of prey species across taxa. We review theoretical and empirical studies of apparent competition, with specific attention to the mechanisms of asymmetry among apparently competing prey species. Asymmetry is theoretically driven by niche overlap, species fitness traits, spatial heterogeneity and generalist predator behavior. In real‐world systems, human‐induced changes to ecosystems such as habitat alteration and introduced species may be ultimate sources of species endangerment. However, apparent competition is shown to be a proximate mechanism when resultant changes introduce or subsidize abundant primary prey for predator populations. Demonstration of apparent competition is difficult due to the indirect relationships between prey and predator species and the potential for concurrent exploitative competition or other community effects. However, general conclusions are drawn concerning the characteristics of prey and predator species likely to exhibit asymmetric apparent competition, and the options for recovering endangered species. While short‐term management may be required to avoid imminent extinction in systems demonstrating apparent competition, we propose adaptive conservation efforts directed at long‐term recovery.

TITLE: The relationship between mindfulness and athletes’ mental skills may be explained by emotion regulation and self-regulation
ABSTRACT: Abstract Background Although numerous psychological determinants of sports success have been identified in the scientific literature, research on the contribution of mindfulness and interoceptive awareness to sports achievements remains limited. This study investigates the relationship between self-reported mental skills determining sports success (i.e., flow state, attention, technique, sensitivity to error, commitment, and achievement), state mindfulness for physical activity (of the mind and the body), and interoceptive awareness (including scales of noticing, not distracting, not worrying, attention regulation, emotional awareness, self-regulation, body listening, and trusting). Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted on a sample of elite athletes in speed skating ( n = 54) and university students of physical education ( n = 102) representing various sports disciplines and competitive levels. The Sports Success Scale (SSS), the State Mindfulness Scale for Physical Activity (SMS-PA), and the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA-2) were used to assess psychological determinants of athletic achievements, state mindfulness, and interoceptive sensitivity, respectively. Results Our findings indicate some small-to-moderate differences in particular dimensions of psychological traits related to sports success, mindfulness, and interoceptive awareness between athletes of different genders, groups, and competitive levels. A chain mediation model showed that the relationship between body mindfulness and psychological variables determining sports success is fully explained by two dimensions of interoception: self-regulation and attention regulation. Conclusions Cultivating the mindfulness state of the body can improve self-regulation and attention regulation, which in turn may increase the mental skills required for successful sports participation. Therefore, mental training should focus primarily on body mindfulness, attention regulation, and self-regulation to improve the mental skills responsible for athletes’ sports achievements. In addition, individual differences in athletes’ gender, sports discipline, and level of sports competition should be considered during mental training.

TITLE: Current plant speciation research: unravelling the processes and mechanisms behind the evolution of reproductive isolation barriers
ABSTRACT: Explaining what species are and how they arise has been at the center of biological research since the first evolutionary concepts were developed by Buffon, Lamarck, and Darwin (Tirard, 2010). With the widespread acceptance of the biological species concept, according to which 'species are a group of interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups' (Mayr, 1996), much recent speciation research has focused on the processes and mechanisms involved in the evolution of reproductive isolation barriers (Coyne & Orr, 2004). The molecular basis of these isolating barriers was known in only a few instances at the time of the Plant Speciation New Phytologist Symposium held in 2003 (Rieseberg & Wendel, 2004). However, the last decade has witnessed major advances to current knowledge on this and other aspects of plant speciation research as was made clear at the recent European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) workshop 'Mechanisms of plant speciation' held in 2015 at Åkersberga, Sweden. Many of the presentations at the EMBO workshop demonstrated the game-changing effects that genome sequencing and genetic analysis, together with the emergence of new promising study systems (Zuellig et al., 2014), are having on our understanding of the genetics of barriers to gene flow between species (reviewed in Baack et al., 2015). For instance, the genetic architectures of traits such as flowering time and flower color (contributing to prepollination barriers) have been resolved in several plant species (Sheehan et al., 2012) and in some cases shown to be involved in the reinforcement of barriers to prevent production of low fitness hybrids (Hopkins, 2013). Similarly, evidence is accumulating on the genetics of Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibilities (contributing to postzygotic barriers), of loci underlying adaptation to environmental heterogeneity with or without chromosomal rearrangement (Ågren et al., 2013; Oneal et al., 2014), and that tight linkage of multiple functional genes can underlie speciation, as illustrated by the supergene architecture of pollination syndromes in Petunia species (Hermann et al., 2013). In addition to gathering support for well-known speciation mechanisms, the presentations at the EMBO workshop emphasized the potential role of other mechanisms, such as epigenetics, in driving speciation. Later, we highlight some of the research that was presented at the workshop and consider its effects on existing paradigms of plant speciation. The role of sexual selection as a selective force in plant speciation is still controversial, in contrast to the situation in animals (Moore & Pannell, 2011). The processes involved in the two major components of sexual selection, that is, intrasexual competition and female choice for males, were poorly understood in plants until the last decade. This was the case even though pollen was recognized to be often far more abundant than the ovules produced by a species, thus creating the conditions (i.e. a strongly biased sex ratio towards males) for intrasexual competition of pollen for ovules. In addition, there is species-dependent variation in ovule number per flower (Burd et al., 2009) and consequently, this variation could correlate with variation in sexual selection. As in animals, a high level of sexual selection in plants should speed up the evolution of traits influencing mating success, and often as a consequence, the evolution of traits responsible for pre- and post-mating hybridization barriers between species. Loren Rieseberg (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada) presented results on ovule number and F1 hybrid seed set in several taxa, and showed that a lower number of ovules (higher sexual selection) correlated with higher cross incompatibility between related species (D. Ortiz-Barientos, D. Ebert, R. Andrew, C. Fitzpatrick, R. Godfrey, K. Ostevik & L. H. Rieseberg, unpublished data). These findings, therefore, strongly support the hypothesis that sexual selection is tightly linked to interspecific barriers in plants and likely to be of high importance in plant speciation. Rieseberg further emphasized that sexual selection might play a role in reinforcement during sympatric speciation. Another aspect of sexual selection concerns female choice for males. Recent research has shown that ovules attract pollen by producing and secreting short peptides, and that this attraction can be selective (Takeuchi & Higashiyama, 2012). Under the concept of female choice, it is expected that species subject to different levels of sexual selection such as self-incompatible (higher sexual selection) and self-compatible (lower sexual selection) species should differ in the selectiveness of their ovules towards male gametes (pollen). Consistent with this hypothesis, Leonie Moyle (Indiana University, USA) presented work showing that ovules from self-incompatible Solanum species were more selective, attracting less heterospecific pollen, compared to ovules from self-compatible Solanum species. When crossing self-compatible and self-incompatible Solanum species, this resulted in unilateral fertilization. These data support the idea that sexual selection drives the establishment of interspecific reproductive barriers, which can lead to unidirectional gene flow between species. Pollen competition not only occurs to increase mating success but also to increase access to maternal resources, as explained by the parental conflict theory (Haig, 2004). The endosperm is the battleground for this conflict of parental interests, enforcing parent-of-origin specific gene expression (genomic imprinting, see later). Such parental conflict is expected to be greater in species experiencing stronger sexual selection, for example, in self-incompatible species vs self-compatible ones. As a consequence, in a cross between a self-incompatible and self-compatible species, the former is expected to 'overpower' the latter, leading to direction-dependent endosperm defects in the hybrid seed, as formulated in the weak inbreeder/strong outbreeder hypothesis (Brandvain & Haig, 2005). Claudia Köhler and colleagues (Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden) tested this hypothesis by investigating the presence of nonreciprocal postzygotic barriers affecting hybrid seed survival between the outbreeder Capsella grandiflora and the inbreeder C. rubella (Rebernig et al., 2015). They reported that high hybrid seed lethality was cross direction-dependent, due to endosperm defects, and mimicked the phenotypic and transcriptomic responses of interploidy hybrid seeds, a case where the parent of higher ploidy 'overpowers' the one of lower ploidy. In accordance with this view, Ana Marcela Florez Rueda (ETH Zurich, Switzerland) reported that cross direction-dependent defects of hybrid seeds between Solanum species were related to the disruption of imprinting in a majority of genes. To what extent genomic imprinting and other types of genomic conflicts are involved in hybridization barriers between inbreeders and outbreeders is an exciting question that remains to be addressed. Intragenomic conflicts, whereby DNA sequences with divergent fitness interests show antagonistic interactions, likely also contribute to the build-up of reproductive isolation. Christian Parisod (University of Neuchatel, Switzerland) illustrated how selfish transposons having diverged between species show massive, asymmetrical genetic and epigenetic changes when merged in hybrids of wild wheats (Senerchia et al., 2015). Repeated DNA loss and epigenetic changes around interspersed transposons in F1 and later generation hybrids indicate that early silencing of conflicting loci is likely necessary to circumvent transposon activation that would otherwise result in hybrid seed defects through mutation and/or epigenetic repatterning affecting nearby genes (Lafon-Placette & Köhler, 2015). As discussed by Luca Comai (University of California, Davis, CA, USA), divergence in CENH3 histones between different species is associated with chromosome elimination in hybrids (Tan et al., 2015), offering additional support for incompatibilities related to epigenetics. To what extent the cascade of genetic and epigenetic changes related to early-acting genomic conflicts contribute to the earlier-discussed allele-specific expression patterns in interspecies/interploidy hybrid seeds remains an open question, but it appears that they may represent overlooked actors driving speciation. While one of the earliest described cases of hybrid necrosis is between two Crepis species (Hollingshead, 1930), the phenomenon of hybrid necrosis and its role in plant speciation had received very little attention until recently. A major advance on this topic occurred when the phenomenon was described in Arabidopsis thaliana and the genetic basis underlying this Dobzhansky–Muller-type incompatibility was revealed (Bomblies et al., 2007). Hybrid necrosis resembles an autoimmune response and is triggered by the deleterious epistasis between naturally occurring alleles at two unlinked loci, one of them being a NB-LRR disease resistance gene. Detlef Weigel (Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tübingen, Germany) presented impressive work revealing that one cluster of NLR disease resistance genes was responsible for more than half of the nearly 150 inter-accession hybrid incompatibility cases observed (Chae et al., 2014). This disease resistance gene cluster is highly variable and shows signs of diversifying selection, leading the authors to propose that hybrid incompatibility observed between Arabidopsis accessions could be shaped by the selective pressure related to host–pathogen coevolution. As Weigel pointed out, deleterious interactions of disease resistance genes could limit the possible combinations of favorable allele combinations present in plant genomes. A similar hybrid incompatibility, involving the interaction between two loci containing disease resistance genes, was reported by Michael Lenhard (University of Potsdam, Germany) to occur between the sister species C. rubella and C. grandiflora (Sicard et al., 2015). Interestingly, both compatible and incompatible alleles for one of the loci are maintained at high frequency by balancing selection in C. grandiflora. Similarly, data presented by Daniel Koenig (Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology) showed that in the inbreeding species C. rubella and C. orientalis, which have extremely low genetic diversity, ancestral polymorphisms of disease resistance genes have been maintained by means of balancing selection (D. Koenig, S. I. Wright, B. Neuffer, T. Slotte, R. Li, J. Hagmann & D. Weigel, unpublished data). Balancing or diversifying selection on disease resistance genes as a result of the selective pressure related to the host–pathogen conflict could drive the evolution of reproductive barriers through lineage sorting of alternative alleles. Nevertheless, if maintenance of the ancestral polymorphism is important to cope with pathogen selection pressure, the question of how a lineage with fixed alleles responds to this pressure remains to be addressed. An extension of this research to species outside the Brassicaceae family should offer exciting insights of substantial impact. Polyploidization through whole genome duplication is a major feature of the evolutionary history of flowering plants (Soltis et al., 2014). It may result from genome duplication within a species (autopolyploidy) or of a hybrid formed between species (allopolyploidy), usually as a consequence of unreduced gamete formation (i.e. gametes with the same chromosome number as somatic cells). Both genetic and environmental effects can influence unreduced gamete formation, and Nico de Storme (Ghent University, Belgium) pointed out that during plant evolution there may have been a causal connection between marked changes in temperature and polyploidization events. He reported that in A. thaliana acute exposure to either high or low temperatures increased formation of unreduced pollen grains (De Storme & Geelen, 2014). Genetic and environmental factors also affect the stability of meiosis in polyploids and their diploid progenitors (Bomblies et al., 2015). Using genome scans, Yant et al. (2013) have identified multiple genes involved in the control of crossing over in autotetraploid Arabidopsis arenosa that were likely targets of selection for the stabilization of meiosis following whole genome duplication. Interestingly, the appropriate alleles for some of these genes occur at low frequency in diploid populations of the same species and, consequently, an absence of such standing variation in diploid ancestral populations might be a factor preventing autopolyploids establishing in some species. From further research, Kirsten Bomblies (John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK) reported differences in the stability of synapsis among diploid strains of A. arenosa from different habitats with two core meiotic proteins (axis/cohesion proteins) showing evidence of having undergone selection. She and her colleagues found that different alleles for the same proteins are subject to selection after polyploidy. Their current hypothesis is that both polyploidy and environmental changes (mainly temperature) affect core meiotic functions, causing alleles that favor a stable meiosis to be selected. In some plant groups polyploidy is associated with asexual reproduction through apomixis, which removes the need for a stable meiosis. However, a complicating factor can be pseudogamy, that is, the requirement of pollination for seed set to occur. Simon Hiscock (University of Oxford, UK) and colleagues found this to be the case in Sorbus (whitebeams). Working with material from the Avon Gorge in the UK, a major hotspot of Sorbus diversity, they established that triploid taxa are facultatively apomictic and pseudogamous, and surprisingly also self-incompatible. Seeds are produced only after pollination by other Sorbus taxa, and because apomixis is facultative this can lead to the generation of new hybrids and further genetic diversification. Studies of very recently formed polyploid species provide insights into the early stages of speciation. Mario Vallejo-Marín (University of Stirling, UK) reported on the young allopolyploid species Mimulus peregrinus which evolved from the triploid sterile hybrid between diploid (M. guttatus) and tetraploid (M. luteus) taxa that were introduced into the British Isles in the nineteenth century (Vallejo-Marín et al., 2015). Despite its recent origin, M. peregrinus has formed at least twice, and its genome seems to be undergoing changes including the potential loss of small genomic regions (Vallejo-Marín et al., 2015), as reported in other recent polyploid systems (Hegarty et al., 2006; Buggs et al., 2012). The discovery of a young allopolyploid species in Mimulus is particularly exciting, as this genus combines a long history of evolutionary and speciation research, with rapidly developing genomic tools, including the whole genome sequence of the parental taxon M. guttatus (Wu et al., 2007). Mimulus thus adds to the short list of powerful systems for the study of polyploid speciation. A major question in polyploid speciation is the extent to which genome duplication facilitates the evolution of ecological and phenotypic novelty (Abbott et al., 2013). Pamela Soltis (University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA) discussed the role of allopolyploidization in generating such novelty in the recently formed allotetraploid Tragopogon (goatsbeard) species, T. mirus and T. miscellus. These neopolyploids show extensive evidence of nonadditive gene expression and genome restructuring (Buggs et al., 2012; Chester et al., 2012) as well as additive and transgressive phenotypic variation relative to their diploid parents. The extent to which novel phenotypes enable allotetraploids to colonize new niches is uncertain, but Soltis and colleagues used ecological niche modeling to report that the niche of Tragopogon polyploids does not entirely overlap those of their parents. Brian Husband (Guelph University, ON, Canada) further showed from a large-scale analysis of diploid, natural tetraploids, and artificially synthesized neotetraploid cytotypes of A. thaliana that the effect of genome duplication on phenotype, including fertility, is dependent on genetic background (i.e. the particular 2x accession used to generate the neotetraploid), which complicates the assessment of effects of polyploidy on phenotypic divergence. The consequences of polyploidization at the macroevolutionary level in plants remains controversial and a better appraisal of speciation vs extinction in polyploids depends on the availability of accurate phylogenetic information and large-scale data bases of phenotypic and ecological information. Itay Mayrose (University of Tel Aviv, Israel) reported on his group's efforts to create a community resource that combines chromosome counts and phylogenetic information across plants (Rice et al., 2015). This ongoing effort will be of great value for elucidating the effect of polyploidization on diversification. The last decade has not seen dramatic changes in paradigms of plant speciation, although it is becoming clear that the role of hybridization between genetically differentiated taxa as a promoter rather than an inhibitor of reproductive isolation deserves further attention (Abbott et al., 2013). Of particular importance is that recent technological advances are allowing identification of the genetic targets of selection, natural or sexual, that drive the establishment of reproductive barriers between species. It is now realized that the architecture of speciation loci may be more variable than previously anticipated, as exemplified by cases of interspersed or supergene-like incompatible loci (Fig. 1). It is also apparent that higher level and more complex speciation patterns occur, with similar drivers and genetic mechanisms involved across taxa, such as hybrid necrosis. In addition, it is evident that an understanding of epigenetic processes provides a mechanistic basis for old concepts such as genome shock, parental conflict, or chromosome deletion. Although the origin of reproductive barriers may often remain elusive, the ongoing sequencing revolution will likely foster the accumulation of new insights at a fast pace. Thus, we can envision that the synthesis of complementary studies emphasizing processes underlying early speciation with the comparative genomics of 'good species' (i.e. the magnifying glass vs spyglass approaches of Via, 2009) will generate a deeper understanding of the biology of plant speciation over the coming years.

TITLE: The Cinderella syndrome: why do malaria-infected cells burst at midnight?
ABSTRACT: An interesting quirk of many malaria infections is that all parasites within a host – millions of them – progress through their cell cycle synchronously. This surprising coordination has long been recognized, yet there is little understanding of what controls it or why it has evolved. Interestingly, the conventional explanation for coordinated development in other parasite species does not seem to apply here. We argue that for malaria parasites, a critical question has yet to be answered: is the coordination due to parasites bursting at the same time or at a particular time? We explicitly delineate these fundamentally different scenarios, possible underlying mechanistic explanations and evolutionary drivers, and discuss the existing corroborating data and key evidence needed to solve this evolutionary mystery.

"…sa marraine lui recommanda sur toutes choses de ne pas passer minuit, l'avertissant que si elle demeurait au bal un moment davantage, son carrosse redeviendrait citrouille…""Her godmother bade her not to stay beyond midnight whatever happened, warning her that if she remained at the ball a moment longer, her coach would again become a pumpkin" – Charles Perrault For most malaria parasite species, the parasite cell cycle within a host is precisely coordinated – malaria parasites invade host red blood cells (RBCs), replicate asexually, and then release the next cohort of parasites in a burst that is synchronized across all parasites within the infection. Intriguingly, this synchronized bursting appears to occur at a particular time: Plasmodium chabaudi (rodent malaria) parasites, for instance, tend to synchronize bursting around midnight [1Landau I. Gautret P. Animal models: rodents.in: Sherman I.W. Malaria: Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis, and Protection. American Society for Microbiology, 1998: 401-417Google Scholar] (thus inspiring our title, although it is important to point out that other Plasmodium species burst at different times of the day/night). Although cell cycle duration varies across malaria parasite species, it is generally a multiple of 24 h (Figure 1). Indeed, the periodicity of fever that follows the simultaneous bursting of RBCs at the end of the cell cycle was once used as a diagnostic tool (e.g., the human parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium malariae have 48 and 72 h cycles, respectively, leading to 'tertian' or 'quartan' fevers [2Garcia C.R.S. et al.Tertian and quartan fevers: temporal regulation in malarial infection.J. Biol. Rhythms. 2001; 16: 436-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar]). Despite an early interest in evolutionary explanations for the coordination of malaria parasites (e.g., [3Hawking F. et al.The biological purpose of the blood cycles of the malaria parasite Plasmodium cynomolgi.Lancet. 1966; ii: 422-424Abstract Google Scholar]), work in recent years has focused on identifying proximate mechanisms for such rhythms. The 24-h cell cycles (or multiples thereof) are suggestive of a circadian basis, and the search continues for homologs of clock genes in the parasite genome [4Sherman I.W. Shocks and clocks.Adv. Parasitol. 2008; 67: 271-277Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar] and host circadian cues that could influence parasite cell cycles (e.g., melatonin [5Hotta C.T. et al.Calcium-dependent modulation by melatonin of the circadian rhythm in malarial parasites.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar]). By uncovering these mechanisms it may be possible to manipulate parasite schedules as a form of control. Interestingly, changes to parasite rhythms have been implicated in resistance to current front-line antimalarial drugs (artemisinin derivatives); parasites are thought to enter a quiescent state, delaying their development until the activity of drugs in their host has diminished (e.g., [6Witkowski B. et al.Increased tolerance to artemisinin in Plasmodium falciparum is mediated by a quiescence mechanism.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2010; 54: 1872-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 7LaCrue A.N. et al.Effects of artesunate on parasite recrudescence and dormancy in the rodent malaria model Plasmodium vinckei.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e26689Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar]). This highlights the need to understand why parasites have a precisely timed schedule at all, what the evolutionary constraints are on their developmental schedule, and what the consequences would be of targeting this fundamental part of malaria parasite biology. Circadian rhythms are endogenous patterns that persistently occur approximately every 24 h [8Rusak B. Zucker I. Biological rhythms and animal behavior.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 1975; 26: 137-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. These rhythms, entrained according to some external stimulus such as a photoperiod, are a consequence of organisms needing to predict changes in their environment, for example, to adopt appropriate activities for day and night [9Edmunds L.N. Cellular and Molecular Bases of Biological Clocks: Models and Mechanisms for Circadian Time-keeping. Springer, 1988Google Scholar]. Although coping with such periodic changes is a fundamental problem for organisms across the tree of life, establishing an adaptive basis for periodicity in behavior or physiological processes is not straightforward [10Sharma V.K. Adaptive significance of circadian clocks.Chronobiol. Int. 2003; 20: 901-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 11Yerushalmi S. Green R.M. Evidence for the adaptive significance of circadian rhythms.Ecol. Lett. 2009; 12: 970-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar]. More difficult still is explaining why parasites that mostly – or exclusively – live within the bodies of other organisms should evolve a circadian rhythm, yet malaria parasites are not unique in this respect. The conventional argument for the evolution of periodicity in parasites is that it optimizes the production of transmissible parasite forms given the diurnal rhythms of the environment. For example, coccidian parasites of the genus Isospora are infective to new hosts only after transmissible forms (immature oocysts) are excreted and have undergone further development in the external environment. These transmissible forms tend to emerge later in the day, apparently avoiding environmental conditions that are unfavorable to survival and development [12Dolnik O.V. Diurnal periodicity in appearance of Isospora (Protozoa: Coccidea) oocysts from some passerine birds.Proc. Zool. Inst. RAS. 1999; 281: 113-118Google Scholar, 13Dolnik O.V. et al.Keeping the clock set under the midnight sun: diurnal periodicity and synchrony of avian Isospora parasites cycle in the High Arctic.Parasitology. 2011; 138: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14Martinaud G. et al.Circadian variations in shedding of the oocysts of Isospora turdi (Apicomplexa) in blackbirds (Turdus merula): an adaptive trait against desiccation and ultraviolet radiation.Int. J. Parasitol. 2009; 39: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar]. Early work on malaria parasites emphasized similar evolutionary thinking, and the timing of foraging activity of mosquitoes (the malaria vector) was argued to be the key selection pressure driving cell cycle coordination [3Hawking F. et al.The biological purpose of the blood cycles of the malaria parasite Plasmodium cynomolgi.Lancet. 1966; ii: 422-424Abstract Google Scholar]. However, this 'Hawking hypothesis' lacks logical coherence and empirical validation (Box 1). The evolutionary drivers of the coordination of malaria parasite cell cycles therefore remain mysterious. Below we offer a conceptual framework for studying this phenomenon and evaluate other evolutionary hypotheses in the light of emerging insight into the mechanisms involved in generating rhythms in malaria parasites.Box 1Malaria transmission and the Hawking hypothesisTransmission of malaria to mosquitoes occurs via specialized parasite forms called gametocytes that are produced by a small subset of infected RBCs. The 'Hawking hypothesis' suggests that the production of gametocytes is coordinated so that they reach maturity and maximum infectiousness when mosquitoes feed [3Hawking F. et al.The biological purpose of the blood cycles of the malaria parasite Plasmodium cynomolgi.Lancet. 1966; ii: 422-424Abstract Google Scholar, 39Garnham P.C.C. Powers K.G. Periodicity of infectivity of plasmodial gametocytes: the Hawking phenomenon.Int. J.

Trop. Med. Hyg. 1968; 62: 731-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar], but tests of its underlying assumptions have been equivocal. First, the hypothesis assumes that synchronized maturation of gametocytes requires synchronized bursting of all infected RBCs. Because gametocyte maturation can take as long as 15 days (for P. falciparum [41Bousema T. Drakeley C. Epidemiology and infectivity of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax gametocytes in relation to malaria control and elimination.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2011; 24: 377-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar]), even slight differences between gametocytes in maturation rates could accumulate to result in differences of many hours by the time maturation is complete. Second, the hypothesis assumes that mature gametocytes circulate in the bloodstream for less than a day (or only one bout of mosquito foraging). Although estimates suggest that the gametocytes of a few malaria species have circulation times on the order of hours [42Gautret P. Motard A. Periodic infectivity of Plasmodium gametocytes to the vector. A review.Parasite. 1999; 6: 103-111PubMed Google Scholar, 43Reece S.E. et al.Sex ratios in the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium chabaudi.Parasitology. 2003; 127: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar], estimates for P. falciparum span several days (reviewed in [41Bousema T.

J. 2004; 3: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar]). Finally, it assumes that maximum infectiousness coincides with peak mosquito biting activity, which is a pattern that most studies have failed to find (e.g., [45Bray R.S. et al.Lack of a circadian rhythm in the ability of the gametocytes of Plasmodium falciparum to infect Anopheles gambiae.Int.

Sinden R.E. Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes: their longevity and infectivity.Parasitology. 1977; 74: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar]). It has been argued that data on infectivity are too sparse to confidently reject the Hawking hypothesis [48Gautret P. Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte periodicity.Acta Trop. 2001; 78: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar]. We agree that more detailed data are required to fully understand any rhythms in gametocyte and vector biology, but argue that the bulk of evidence against the Hawking hypothesis is probably insurmountable.

We agree that more detailed data are required to fully understand any rhythms in gametocyte and vector biology, but argue that the bulk of evidence against the Hawking hypothesis is probably insurmountable. From our perspective, what has been lacking from studies of malaria parasite cell cycles is an explicit recognition that the observed coordination could be the effect of selection for either synchrony or timing (see Figure I in Box 2); most evolutionary hypotheses have implicitly assumed that parasites gain an evolutionary advantage from one of these traits and ignored the other. For simplicity, we refer to synchrony and timing as 'traits' but stress that in reality these phenotypes are the outcome of several underlying traits. Alternatively, coordination may provide no evolutionary advantage to parasites, may actually benefit hosts, and may be entirely under the control of hosts. Framing the evolution of coordination in this way reveals five possible 'selective scenarios', outlined below and detailed in Table 1.(i)Synchrony of cell cycles is an adaptation of malaria parasites that enhances their fitness. For example, synchrony could provide parasites with safety in numbers from immune attack. To coordinate this synchrony, parasites could either communicate directly (e.g., via a development communicating mechanism [15Dyer M. Day T. Regulation of the rate of asexual growth and commitment to sexual development by diffusable factors from in vitro cultures of Plasmodium falciparum.Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2003; 68: 403-409PubMed Google Scholar]), they could have their own internal clock, or they could use timing cues from host circadian rhythms [2Garcia C.R.S. et al.Tertian and quartan fevers: temporal regulation in malarial infection.J. Biol. Rhythms. 2001; 16: 436-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Hotta C.T. et al.Calcium-dependent modulation by melatonin of the circadian rhythm in malarial parasites.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar]. In the first case, synchrony and timing would not be linked and so synchronized parasites in different hosts may burst at different times of day. In the latter two cases, because parasites are using time cues to achieve synchrony, bursting at a precise time would likely be a byproduct of selection for synchrony (but does not provide an additional advantage to parasites).(ii)The timing of bursting is an adaptation of malaria parasites (i.e., infected RBCs bursting at a particular time of the day/night maximizes fitness). For example, timing could allow parasites to avoid a circadian release of parasite killing immune responses or match the appearance of essential resources. Assuming a particular schedule offers the same benefit to all parasites in an infection, synchrony would be a byproduct of the evolution of timing because all parasites would be on the same schedule. Parasites could set the timing of cell cycle development either indirectly by using cues from the host circadian rhythm or directly using their own internal 'clock'.(iii)Synchrony and timing of cell cycles are both adaptations of malaria parasites and may be selected for through different processes. In other words, each trait offers a distinct fitness advantage, that is, some combination of (i) and (ii).(iv)Neither synchrony nor timing of cell cycles is an adaptation of malaria parasites. Instead, the coordination of cell cycles offers some advantage to hosts. For example, concentrating particular parasite cell cycle stages to a particular time of day could maximize the efficacy of immune factors with circadian rhythms [16McQueen P.G. McKenzie F.E. Host control of malaria infections: constraints on immune and erythropoeitic response kinetics.PLoS Comp. Biol. 2008; 4: e1000149Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar] or could limit invasion success by maximizing competition between parasites for host RBCs.(v)Neither synchrony nor timing of cell cycles is an adaptation of malaria parasites or hosts. Instead, parasites are passively traversing their life cycle and the cell cycle pattern is constrained by physiological or physical features of either, or both, hosts and parasites (see Figure II in Box 2). Under this scenario, the coordination of parasite development may be neutral or costly to either hosts or parasites.Box 2The malaria cell cycle and its potential constraintsMalaria parasites replicate asexually within host RBCs before bursting and releasing the progeny parasites (merozoites), each with the capacity to invade other RBCs and begin a new cycle of replication. Explaining the evolutionary significance of the observed periodicity of malaria infections requires considering the importance of two distinct traits (Figure I).Figure II illustrates the potential constraints on malaria parasite cell cycles.Figure IIPhysical and physiological constraints on cell cycles. The physical processes of RBC invasion and parasite replication take time, meaning that merozoite release cannot happen before a time, t0. Although malaria parasites complete all nuclear divisions prior to cellular division [50Leete T.H. Rubin H. Malaria and the cell cycle.Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 442-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar] (making the process more efficient), increasing the number of merozoites produced could increase the time required until a mature schizont is ready to burst. Plasmodium species that produce different numbers of merozoites may therefore have different values of t0. At the other end of the spectrum, once the nuclear divisions have been completed, there may be an upper limit on bursting time, t1, as parasites may be constrained by passive processes that cause bursting, through deterioration of the infected RBC or bursting under osmotic stress [51Lew V.L. et al.Excess hemoglobin digestion and the osmotic stability of Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells.Blood. 2003; 101: 4189-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar]. The difference between times t0 and t1 define the window of opportunity during which parasites can burst from infected RBCs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Recent experimental work suggests that infected RBCs are, indeed, not bursting at the earliest possible opportunity, t0, [49Grüring C. et al.Development and host cell modifications of Plasmodium falciparum blood stages in four dimensions.Nat. Commun. 2011; 2: 165Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar]. Using an in vitro approach, Grüring et al. [49Grüring C. et al.Development and host cell modifications of Plasmodium falciparum blood stages in four dimensions.Nat. Commun. 2011; 2: 165Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar] demonstrate that merozoite formation and the maturation of schizonts are completed several hours before bursting. Although not conclusive evidence, because it is not clear whether merozoites are finished developing at the submicroscopic level, this suggests that schizonts are not bursting as soon as possible and that they are waiting for some cue that either allows them to synchronize [scenario (i)], forces them to synchronize [scenario (iv)], or signals optimal timing of bursting [scenarios (ii) or (iii)].Table 1Putative evolutionary explanationsaNon-mutually exclusive. for coordination as an adaptation of malaria parasitesUltimate explanationSelective scenariobThe selective scenario indicates which 'trait' is under selection: (i) denotes a direct advantage to synchrony and (ii) denotes a direct advantage to timing.Key evidence required to evaluate hypothesesTransmission1.

TITLE: Development of a cost-efficient novel method for rapid, concurrent genotyping of five common single nucleotide polymorphisms of the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene by tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system
ABSTRACT: Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a molecular trophic factor that plays a key role in neuronal survival and plasticity. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the BDNF gene have been associated with specific phenotypic traits in a large number of neuropsychiatric disorders and the response to psychotherapeutic medications in patient populations. Nevertheless, due to study differences and occasionally contrasting findings, substantial further research is required to understand in better detail the association between specific BDNF SNPs and these psychiatric disorders. While considerable progress has been made recently in developing advanced genotyping platforms of SNPs, many high-throughput probe- or array-based detection methods currently available are limited by high costs, slow processing times or access to advanced instrumentation. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based, tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system (T-ARMS) method is a potential alternative technique for detecting SNP genotypes efficiently, quickly, easily, and cheaply. As a tool in psychopathology research, T-ARMS was shown to be capable of detecting five common SNPs in the BDNF gene (rs6265, rs988748, rs11030104, 11757G/C and rs7103411), which are all SNPs with previously demonstrated clinical relevance to schizophrenia and depression. The present technique therefore represents a suitable protocol for many research laboratories to study the genetic correlates of BDNF in psychiatric disorders.

ABSTRACT: The vast majority of plants are modular i.e., made up of reiterated pieces. Plant pieces also tend to be highly totipotent. You can regenerate a whole plant from just a tiny fragment of tissue. The ultimate elaboration of modularity and totipotency is clonal growth: one plant gives rise to another gives rise to another gives rise to another with no sex in between. A large proportion of plants possesses the capacity for clonal growth and, as a group, plants clone themselves in an intriguing variety of ways. Much of the recent fascination with clonal plants among botanists grew out of work by John Harper and colleagues in the 1970s (reviewed by Harper and White, 1974; Harper, 1978). During the decade that followed, other biologists joined Harper & co. in exploring the consequences of modularity for the ecology, and evolution of clonal plants, and animals (reviewed in Jackson, Buss, and Cook, 1985; Harper, Rosen, and White, 1986). From this activity, emerged a set of questions concerning morphology, physiology, ecology and evolution that continues to dominate current research on clonal plants, and has been pursued by a cosmopolitan but close-knit group of researchers. Since the late 1980s, clonal plant enthusiasts have met every two years or so at small workshops, the proceedings of which have been duly recorded in several volumes appearing as books (van Groenendael and de Kroon, 1990), special issues of journals (Callaghan et al., 1992) or both (Soukupova´ et al., 1994; Oborny and Podani, 1996). The Ecology and Evolution of Clonal Plants is the latest installment from the clonal plant cognoscenti. Like the four previous volumes, it is a compendium of review articles that, according to the editors (Hans de Kroon and Jan van Groenendael), "demonstrates how elementary processes at the level of the individual, the population and the community are influenced by clonal growth." My overall impression is that this is a fairly comprehensive and nicely put-together summary of contemporary research on clonal plants. Even though the book covers a lot of ground, from physiology and development to community ecology and global change, most of the chapters provide the general reader with sufficient background to appreciate why the questions at hand are important and to evaluate the progress made in addressing them. Each chapter ends with an extensive list of references so that the book, as a whole, provides a wide window on the diverse literature concerning clonal plants. This book would make an excellent starting point for a graduate-level course on clonal plants. In this way, it may ultimately fulfill one of the editors' major objectives: to make the interesting things that clonal plants do "more widely appreciated in future studies" at the various levels of biological organization. It is somewhat unusual that The Ecology and Evolution of Clonal Plants was published on the heels of four other edited volumes that have appeared at regular intervals over the last ten years. In addition, all these volumes have involved many of the same authors. At least one author on 15 of the 18 chapters in this recent book has also authored a chapter in one of the previous volumes, usually on the same general topic. What does this proliferation of review articles mean? How distinct is this most recent volume from previous efforts? In reviewing this book, I have used these four previous volumes as a kind of fossil record to gauge how quickly this field is evolving. Below, I discuss a sample of chapters from this new book in terms of what questions are being asked, what approaches are being used to answer them, and how the field of clonal plant research has progressed over the last decade. Much of the interest in clonal plants focuses on how their pattern of development influences the way they grow, how they capture resources, and how they respond to environmental variation in space and time. Six of the 18 chapters in this book address these general questions from a variety of angles. Watson, Hay, and Newton discuss how the developmental program of clonal plants can be understood in terms of meristem demography (i.e., meristem birth, death, dormancy, and allocation to growth vs. reproduction). The demographic properties of meristems may, in turn, influence how clonal genotypes (genets) respond to environmental heterogeneity. The meristem perspective is closely related to the large body of work on module demography by Harper and his students (reviewed by Harper, 1978), and has been promoted for some time by Watson and others (e.g., Watson, 1984; White, 1984; Fagerstro¨m, 1992; Bonser and Aarssen, 1996). This chapter summarizes a fair bit of previous work on water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and describes some recently published data on mayapple (Podophyllum peltatum). Watson et al. argue that meristem demography will strongly influence the persistence and proliferation of ramets and genets in natural populations. Accordingly, they urge the reader to "move away from the notion that sexual reproduction is the primary means by which clonal plants achieve fitness" and embrace the view that "ramet persistence and the success of clones at generating new ramets need to be considered as equally important elements in estimations of clonal fitness". This statement puts clonal propagation on the same level as sexual reproduction in terms of the transmission of genes over evolutionary time: a rather controversial position (see, for example, Mogie, 1992, pp. 4–15). I agree that the rate and mode of clonal spread will influence fitness, but I am not fully convinced by Watson et al.'s argument that clonal growth is a means of achieving fitness. Much depends on the evolutionary dynamics of the species in question. For example, rapid clonal spread may strongly enhance the representation of genotypes within individual populations, but may be of less importance in the long term if populations undergo frequent extinction and recolonization via seed. At this point we do not know enough to say whether a ramet- or meristem-based definition of clonal fitness will really improve our understanding of microevolution in clonal plants. One of the most significant and widely investigated characteristics of clonal plants is that the component ramets that make up a genet may be physiologically integrated and share resources. Marshall and Price review how experiments involving radioactive tracers and selective defoliation, the mainstay techniques in this field, are used to define the extent of "integrated physiological units" and to help understand how morphology influences physiological integration. This chapter is a good review, but does not present much in the way of new ideas and data. Most of the chapter goes over the same ground reviewed by Price and Hutchings (1992), and features data previously presented by Price and Hutchings (1992) and Kemball and Marshall (1995). Jo´nsdo´ttir and Watson approach clonal integration by defining the potential for physiological integration in terms of three variables: ramet longevity, ramet generation time, and the longevity of physical connections between ramets. A factorial combination of these variable results in five potential categories of plants that differ in the size of connected ramet networks and the extent to which the ramet network is physiologically integrated. A new comparative analysis that places 51 species in these five categories suggests that the maintenance of large, integrated ramet networks is most common in plants inhabiting stable but resource-poor habitats, although this result may be weakened by potentially confounding correlations between clonal mode, habitat type, and phylogenetic relatedness. The adaptive significance of physiological integration in resource-poor environments is further explored by comparing Jo´nsdo´ttir's previously published data on 14C translocation in Carex bigelowii with new data from Podophyllum peltatum. This is a difficult problem to tackle experimentally. Reduced growth of individual ramets and whole genets has been observed after connections between ramets are experimentally severed. However, this experimental approach focuses on the advantages of clonal integration but does not assess the risks and costs of maintaining physiological connections between ramets. These costs would seem much more difficult to quantify. It is clear from these chapters that the extent to which ramets are physiologically integrated varies markedly between species, yet very few species have been studied in much detail. Later on in the book, the reader is told that many important consequences of clonal growth for population and community dynamics depend on the degree of clonal integration. The difficulty of making generalizations about the nature of integration within genets is likely to hinder the interpretation of patterns and processes in clonal populations and communities. Consider a clonal plant that maintains physiological connections between ramets in a patchy environment. Some ramets wind up in patches with an abundance of one resource, whereas others are in spots where a complementary resource is abundant. If the resource-extraction activities of ramets could be co-ordinated, the genet as a whole could benefit from different ramets acquiring different locally abundant resources and then sharing them with each other. Alpert and Stuefer develop the idea of division of labor in clonal plants by analogy with division of labor in human economic systems. The analogy results in a particularly clear definition of the problem. Division of labor in clonal plants requires that: (1) Ramets share resources. (2) Individual ramets allocate most effort to extracting resources that are most abundant to them rather than scarce resources that would limit their growth if they were not connected to other ramets. (3) Genets benefit more from resource sharing when individual ramets specialize on locally abundant resources. In other words, there should be a positive interaction between resource sharing and specialization. They go on to present fairly convincing published and unpublished evidence for (1) and (2) and discuss the need for future work on (3). They also outline the various risks and costs of maintaining division of labor, most of which depend on ecological factors such as disturbance and pathogens. Confirming that division of labor is adaptive will require some highly controlled experiments, the results of which will ultimately have to be validated in the highly uncontrolled world of real habitat. How clonal plants spread in space and whether their meandering through heterogeneous environments can be viewed as "foraging" have received considerable attention. Oborny and Cain review the various theoretical approaches used to study the spread of clonal genets in relation to environmental heterogeneity. Although this seems to be an active area of research, these authors dwell extensively on previously reviewed material. In fact, the four figures they present are recycled directly from reviews published in previous books on clonal plants (Sutherland and Stillman, 1990; Oborny, 1994; Cowie, Watkinson, and Sutherland 1996). Populations and communities of clonal plants may often consist of complex networks of ramets that are physiologically integrated to some extent. Four chapters explore how these aspects of clonal growth affect the nature of intraspecific and interspecific interactions. Van der Hoeven and During review a substantial body of experimental work with mosses that investigates the interactions between shoots and the mechanisms that regulate shoot densities (see also During, 1990). While there seems to be good evidence for positive interactions between shoots leading to facilitation in moss populations, most of this chapter has relatively little to do with clonal growth per se. Because clonal propagation in mosses occurs primarily through ramet fragmentation and the production of specialized asexual propagules, there is little opportunity for physiological integration among ramets and, thus, higher order effects of clonal growth. The development of size hierarchies in plant populations and self-thinning are central issues in plant population ecology. Suzuki and Hutchings explore how clonal growth affects these processes. Clonal plants may differ in terms of shoot dynamics from widely studied annual plants because large quantities of resources are often stored in perennating organs, and clonal integration may allow internal control of shoot proliferation. The authors review empirical and theoretical evidence that resource storage reduces self-thinning in clonal populations. However, as the authors point out, resource storage also occurs in non-clonal perennials. Whether there are specific consequences of clonal growth (i.e., internal control) remains unclear. Clonal growth adds an extra dimension to competition in plant communities because clonal plants not only compete for resources via overtopping and root competition, but also compete for space through clonal expansion. Space invasion may, in turn, be facilitated by physiological integration among ramets: connected ramets can support one another while battling neighbors. Herben and Hara explore the consequences of clonal growth for interspecific competition. They begin by discussing the relative importance of founder control vs. dominance control in determining the outcome of experimental two-species interactions (see also Herben, 1996), move through how modeling might link ramet-level processes to community dynamics, and end by considering the factors that affect species coexistence in communities where clonal plants are common. Given the limited data on mechanisms of clonal integration in individual species (see above), it is no surprise that hypotheses far outnumber conclusions at the community level. In the last chapter dealing with the consequences of clonal growth for community-level interactions, de Kroon and Bobbink review both published and unpublished case studies to fuel some informed speculation on why atmospheric deposition of nitrogen in many areas of western Europe has been associated with increasing dominance by clonal species. They hypothesize that clonal plants compete effectively under high nutrient conditions by sequestering nitrogen in well-developed storage organs, and rapidly preempting space via clonal spread. However, this chapter is reminiscent of many other efforts to identify general characteristics of invasive or aggressive species; no hard and fast rules emerge. Because clonal spread results in the proliferation of genetically identical ramets and is often associated with a low frequency of sexual recruitment, clonal growth may directly affect the distribution of phenotypic and genetic variation within and among populations, and, ultimately, how populations evolve. The four chapters that explore the evolutionary implications of clonal growth were of particular interest to me. However, I found them largely lacking in terms of new ideas or critical analysis of old ideas. McLellan, Prati, Kaltz, and Schmid provide a wide-ranging review of the population-genetic consequences of clonal growth. They begin by discussing some of the technical and statistical issues that complicate the analysis of allelic vs. genotypic diversity in clonal populations, go on to review the limited work on how clonal growth affects the amount and structuring of genetic variation within and among populations, and end by discussing what little is known about the extent to which genetic diversity in clonal populations is maintained by various factors, including sporadic sexual recruitment, frequency-dependent selection involving pathogens, environmental heterogeneity, somatic mutation, and gene flow. There are gaping holes in our knowledge of the evolutionary genetics of clonal plants. Although McLellan et al. do an excellent job of identifying the questions that warrant serious attention, their review touches on too many things to critically dissect any particular issue. For instance, they reiterate one of the most widely cited conclusions from population-genetic studies of clonal plants: "on average, clonal plants do not seem to be genetically less variable than non-clonal plants" (see also Ellstrand and Roose, 1987; Hamrick and Godt, 1990; Wide´n, Cronberg, and Wide´n, 1994). While I agree that the old notion of clonal monomorphism has rightly fallen by the wayside, no one has attempted a rigorous comparison of genetic structure in obligately sexual perennials vs. perennials where sexual recruitment is extremely limited (i.e., what the authors of this volume typically view as clonal plants). Moreover, there have been relatively few studies that have exploited intraspecific variation in reproductive mode (i.e., clonal vs. sexual) to more directly investigate how clonal growth affects genetic structure. It seems that our efforts to understand how clonal growth affects genetic diversity has focussed too closely on average levels of diversity and ignored the repeated observation that clonal species exhibit particularly wide variation in genetic structure among populations. For instance, data on genotypic diversity within populations of 32 predominantly clonal species summarized by Wide´n, Cronberg, and Wide´n (1994) indicate that single-genotype populations occur along with genotypically diverse populations in more than a dozen species. What are the ecological and evolutionary causes and consequences of this variation? In many species, the relative importance of clonal vs. sexual recruitment may be influenced strongly by environmental factors. As a result, populations at the periphery of a species' geographical range may contain relatively little genotypic diversity, thereby limiting the potential for evolutionary expansion of the species' distribution. McLellan et al. emphasize the lack of data on how clonal growth affects the spatial distribution of genotypes and alleles within populations. However, they do not clearly indicate why this is an interesting question. Yet, the spatial dispersion of clones within a population may have several significant consequences. For example, localized clonal spread may interfere with sexual reproduction by reducing pollen transfer and mating between genets (Handel, 1985). High levels of between-ramet self-pollination (geitonogamy) may have a major impact on the evolution of the breeding system (e.g., Harder and Barrett, 1996). The breeding system may, in turn, impose selective pressures on clonal growth form (Silander, 1985). However, there has been almost no effort to quantify the effect of different modes of clonal growth on the mating system, or to investigate whether plants with different breeding systems possess different modes of clonal growth. Extensive clonal growth may affect the evolution of life history traits in a variety of ways. Ove Eriksson explores the evolution of seed dispersal and recruitment in clonal populations. Experimental and comparative evidence suggests that the evolution of seed size and dispersal behavior is influenced by when seed recruitment occurs during the history of a population. If recruitment is restricted to the time when a population is founded, small dispersible seeds should be favored. If recruitment occurs infrequently but repeatedly throughout the life span of a population, large competitive seeds should be favored. Eriksson has been developing this idea for about a decade. This chapter presents a bit of new empirical data and minor refinements to the general hypothesis, but no new conclusions or predictions. The evolution of seed recruitment and dispersal in clonal populations has recently been examined in the context of metapopulation dynamics (Olivieri, Michalakis, and Gouyon, 1995; Piquot et al., 1998). Cycles of colonization and extinction are strongly implied in Eriksson's model, and it would have been nice to see a link developed between these two theoretical approaches. Eriksson's hypothesis assumes that there is a trade-off between sexual reproduction and clonal growth. This notion is discussed in passing several times throughout the book but is never dealt with directly. The cost of sexual reproduction in terms of reduced survival and growth is a major issue in life-history theory. However, determining the nature of the cost is often complicated because the expected genetic trade-off between sexual reproduction and growth may be obscured by positive phenotypic correlations: vigorous individuals do everything well (Roff, 1992). Clonal plants offer excellent opportunities for investigating life-history trade-offs because individual genotypes may be replicated and then subjected to various treatments in an array of experimental environments. Clonal growth may influence the long-term evolution of life history by affecting the accumulation of mutations. Klekowski discusses this idea with respect to his "somatic mutation theory of clonality." He argues that, in the absence of sexual recombination, genetic diversity in clonal populations is generated through somatic mutation. As clones age and spread they are likely to accumulate deleterious mutations; a process similar to the mutational meltdown in asexual populations envisioned by Michael Lynch and co-workers (e.g., Lynch et al., 1993). However, mutation-selection balance in highly clonal populations is expected to allow the build-up of mutational load that specifically impairs sexual reproduction, because the processes involved in sex contribute little to the fitness of genets. This is analogous to the loss of eyes and pigments in cave-dwelling organisms (Fong, Kane, and Culver, 1995), a case of "use it or lose it." This hypothesis might explain the many observations of infrequent sexual reproduction in highly clonal populations (e.g., Sculthorpe, 1967). Yet, the somatic mutation theory of clonality has received little empirical investigation (Eckert, Dorken, and Mitchell, 1999). In fact, few studies have even determined the extent to which low seed production in clonal populations is due to genetic vs. environmental factors. The lack of attention to this hypothesis has always seemed strange to me, as Klekowski has published a lot of interesting work on this subject (e.g., Klekowski, 1988). Because this chapter only scratches the surface of his previous work and does not present any substantially new thinking on the topic, it may not generate new interest in the long-term evolutionary interactions among clonal reproduction, mutation, and sexual reproduction. Somatic mutation is repeatedly invoked as a source of genetic variation in clonal populations, yet there has been little or no effort to directly quantify the rate at which somatic mutation generates variation. McLellan et al. suggest that "it would be interesting to produce genetically homogeneous populations of clonal plants by vegetative reproduction or by selection and then follow the reappearance of heritable variation in the subsequent generations of sexually and vegetatively produced offspring." Unfortunately, they do not indicate how many generations it might take until the variation created by somatic mutation might be experimentally detectable, the sample sizes required, or how one might compare the amount of heritable variation between sexually- and clonally-produced offspring. Because clonal genotypes are represented by multiple ramets, phenotypic variation and genetic variation are organized hierarchically at the population level. There may be heritable differences in fitness at the ramet and genet level that arise from variation in the performance of individual ramets as well as higher order differences in fitness among genets that arise from genet-level characteristics (e.g., ramet number and density). Vuorisalo, Tuomi, Pedersen, and Ka¨a¨r present a statistical model for quantifying phenotypic selection in hierarchically structured populations. This is an important problem that challenges some fundamental notions about the operation of natural selection in clonal populations. However, it is a complex problem that is unlikely to attract much attention unless rendered in an accessible way. This chapter succeeds to some extent in this regard, because it boils down their previously published model into a more accessible format and illustrates how the model might be used with data on the factors affecting fruit dispersal in Podophyllum peltatum. Determining the spatial boundaries of individual genets has long been one of the most vexing problems for workers interested in clonal plants. In the last five years, ecologists and evolutionary biologists have gained access to a wide variety of new, highly variable PCR-based genetic markers, such as RAPDs, ISSRs, AFLPs, SSCPs, and microsatellites, which greatly increase our ability to unambiguously identify individual genets. McLellan et al. briefly mention these new markers, but do not delve into how we might use them in novel ways. For example, a combination of chloroplast and nuclear markers could be used to quantify the relative importance of sexual reproduction and recruitment vs. gene flow in maintaining genotypic diversity in clonal populations. Sex would tend to break down disequilibrium between markers, whereas gene flow (without subsequent sex) would tend to increase it. A chapter exploring the new uses and potential pitfalls of PCR markers would have made a nice addition to this book, especially considering the profound implications of this technology for research on clonal plants. Probably the most overarching evolutionary question involving clonal plants concerns the adaptive significance of clonal growth itself. Various chapters in this book briefly touch on the fitness benefits of clonal growth, especially with respect to spatial heterogeneity of resource abundance and risk-spreading. However, no one chapter presents a comprehensive evolutionary analysis. This is a difficult question because, among species, clonal growth happens in many different ways and is, therefore, likely to be associated with diverse costs and benefits (e.g., multiplication of ramets, dispersal, resource acquisition, anchorage, storage; Grace, 1993). Given this diversity, a combination of experimental and comparative studies would seem most effective. Judging from the chapters in this book, there seem to be little experimental investigation of the costs and benefits of clonal growth. Experimental work would be greatly facilitated by intraspecific variation in one or more of the parameters that define clonal growth (e.g., Jo´nsdo´ttir and Watson's three variables relating to clonal integration, see above). For example, Watson, Hay, and Newton briefly mention variation in the rate of ramet production among genotypes of Eichhornia crassipes. However, this kind of variation is clearly underexploited. Klimeš, Klimeš;t1ova´, Hendriks, and van Groenendael use a comparative analysis to ask whether clonal growth is more common in some types of habitats than others or is associated with particular life history traits. This chapter is an expanded version of a chapter that appeared in another recent edited volume (van Groenendael et al., 1997; see Mazer, 1998, for a critical review). In an attempt to organize the diversity of ways in which plants clone themselves, the authors come up with a rather cumbersome taxonomy of clonal growth modes that consists of 21 categories, each typified by a particular species (some of which may not be familiar to the North American readers). They go on to categorize the mode of clonal growth as well as ecological and life-history characteristics for 2760 plant species in central Europe. Using species as independent data points, they show that clonal plants are less likely to self-fertilize, or be pollinated by insects than non-clonal plants, and are disproportionately common in cool, moist or low-nutrient environments. They explore the extent to which phylogenetic history influences these associations between ecology, life history and clonal growth by repeating the analyses at the family level. Families were mapped on to a DNA-based phylogeny of the seed plants, and correlations between family means for ecological and life history characters and the proportion of species in each family exhibiting clonal growth were tested using phylogenetically-independent contrasts. These analyses confirmed some of the species-level results but not others. Yet, it is not clear how we should reconcile the differences between the species-level and "phylogenetically-correct" analyses. Family-level averages for ecological and life history traits may be relatively meaningless if there is broad variation within families. The species- and family-level patterns detected also do not lend themselves to any clear evolutionary interpretation because the authors only report univariate analyses. As with most univariate analyses of multiple trait-environment and trait-trait correlations, it is often impossible to determine which associations represent adaptations and which arise indirectly from intercorrelations between various environmental and life history characteristics (i.e., multiple colinearity). If you are a newcomer to the world of clonal plants, The Ecology and Evolution of Clonal Plants will serve as a excellent introduction to the many interesting issues surrounding the mechanisms and consequences of clonal growth. Although this book is preceded by four similar edited volumes published during the last decade, it is probably the most comprehensive review of clonal plant research to date. Unlike the previous books, it is produced and distributed by a publisher who has made it readily available to North American readers. However, if you have been closely following the literature on clonal plants and are looking for new ideas, this book may be less useful. It presents some new data plus refinements to existing hypotheses and approaches but does not contain much in the way of new breakthroughs. For the most part, this book represents the regular crowd asking the same questions in more or less the same way. After reading this book in the context of the four previous edited volumes, I began to see clonal plants as a metaphor for the field of research that seeks to understand them. There has been extensive proliferation of journal papers and review articles exploring various aspects of clonal growth. There has also been considerable integration between the workers in this field, even though they are scattered around the globe. Ideas have been extensively shared, and there seems to have been a lot of collaboration between workers interested in similar questions. However, the ideas and approaches in clonal plant research have not evolved much in the past decade. Hopefully, the solid summary of past progress provided by this book will serve as a launching pad for future innovation.

TITLE: Evolutionary trade-offs between thermal tolerance and locomotor and developmental performance in drosophilid flies
ABSTRACT: Cold-tolerant ectothermal animals are generally absent from warmer regions, suggesting that the acquisition of cold tolerance is associated with the loss of adaptation to warmer environments. In the present study, we compared thermal tolerance, walking speed (WS) and pupal development (PD) for 28 drosophilid species from cool-temperate, warm-temperate, and subtropical regions by the phylogenetically-based method and the conventional regression to understand trade-offs between these traits. A significant negative relationship was observed between cold tolerance and the rate of PD in both sexes and between cold tolerance and WS in the male in the phylogenetically-based analysis. Similar results were obtained in the conventional regression analysis, although the level of significance somewhat differed. Thus, cold tolerant species are assumed to have lost abilities to develop and walk fast. Subsequently, they may become more vulnerable to predators, parasitoids or infectious microorganisms and may have become extinct in warmer regions through enemy-mediated interactions and/or resource competition with cold susceptible species with faster development and quicker locomotion. In the present study, no significant relationship was observed between heat tolerance and WS or the rate of PD in the phylogenetically-based analysis, although heat tolerance was significantly related with the rate of PD in the conventional regression analysis. Thus, trade-offs associated with heat tolerance were not apparent.

TITLE: Gar1p Binds to the Small Nucleolar RNAs snR10 and snR30 in Vitro through a Nontypical RNA Binding Element
ABSTRACT: The nucleolar proteins Gar1p and fibrillarin possess a typical nucleolar glycine/arginine-rich domain and belong to ribonucleoprotein particles. Both proteins are essential for yeast cell growth and are required for pre-rRNA processing. In addition, Gar1p is involved in pre-rRNA pseudouridylation, whereas fibrillarin is required for pre-rRNA methylation. Gar1p and fibrillarin are each associated with a different subset of the small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). Gar1p is co-immunoprecipitated with the H/ACA family of snoRNAs, whereas fibrillarin is co-immunoprecipitated with the C/D family. However, attempts to demonstrate direct interactions between fibrillarin and snoRNAs have failed, and such interactions between Gar1p and the H/ACA snoRNAs had not yet been reported. Among the H/ACA snoRNAs associated with Gar1p, one can distinguish a large group of snoRNAs that are not essential in yeast and serve as guides for pseudouridine synthesis onto the pre-rRNA molecule. In contrast, the two snoRNAs snR10 and snR30 are required for normal cell growth and for pre-rRNA cleavage. We show here that Gar1p interacts in vitro directly and specifically with these two snoRNAs. Deletion analysis of Gar1p indicates that a major RNA binding element, which is extremely well conserved throughout evolution, lies in the middle of the protein. However, this domain alone binds poorly to the target RNAs and an accessory domain is required to restore efficient binding. The accessory domain can be either one of the glycine/arginine-rich domains or a second element of the core of the protein that is highly conserved between different species. The nucleolar proteins Gar1p and fibrillarin possess a typical nucleolar glycine/arginine-rich domain and belong to ribonucleoprotein particles. Both proteins are essential for yeast cell growth and are required for pre-rRNA processing. In addition, Gar1p is involved in pre-rRNA pseudouridylation, whereas fibrillarin is required for pre-rRNA methylation.

The accessory domain can be either one of the glycine/arginine-rich domains or a second element of the core of the protein that is highly conserved between different species. It has recently been demonstrated that the numerous small nucleolar RNAs found in the nucleolus of eukaryotic cells can be sorted into two classes (1Balakin A.G. Smith L. Fournier M.J.

However, there is a subset of the C/D snoRNAs that do not appear to be involved in methylation, but are required for pre-rRNA processing.

Cell. 1996; 86: 823-834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 7Ganot P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Kiss T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 941-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). They are associated with the nucleolar protein Gar1p and are required for targeting pseudouridylation onto the pre-rRNA molecule (8Ganot P. Bortolin M.L. Kiss T. Cell. 1997; 89: 799-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 9Ni J. Tien A.L. Fournier M.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 565-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Among the H/ACA snoRNAs, snR10 and snR30 form a separate subset since they have been found to be required for normal pre-rRNA processing, and deletion of snR30 is lethal (10Tollervey D. Guthrie C. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3873-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 11Morrissey J.P. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), whereas the other H/ACA snoRNAs can be deleted without any significant phenotype. It is still controversial (snR10) or not yet determined (snR30) whether these two RNAs are also involved in targeting pseudouridylation onto the pre-rRNA (8Ganot P. Bortolin M.L. Kiss T. Cell. 1997; 89: 799-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 9Ni J. Tien A.L. Fournier M.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 565-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) or onto other RNA molecules. Fibrillarin has long been known to be part of the snoRNP particles, since antisera from humans with autoimmune diseases contain antibodies that recognize fibrillarin and allow to precipitate the snoRNA U3 (12Tyc K. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3113-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). It has now been demonstrated that fibrillarin is associated with all box C/D snoRNAs, even though attempts to show direct interactions have not been successful. These observations suggest that fibrillarin could be part of a larger structure, without directly contacting the snoRNAs. Gar1p has recently been shown to be associated with every H/ACA snoRNA (1Balakin A.G. Smith L. Fournier M.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 823-834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), but no direct interaction has yet been reported. Gar1p, as well as Nop1p/fibrillarin, Nsr1p/nucleolin/gar2p, Ssb1p, and Nop3p all contain a similar domain rich in glycine and arginine residues referred to as the GAR domain (13Girard J. Lehtonen H. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Amalric F. Tollervey D. Lapeyre B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The function of this domain is still hypothetical. A related domain found in the hnRNP U protein was suggested to be directly involved in RNA binding (14Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), whereas the GAR domain of nucleolin was shown to play an accessory role in RNA binding, possibly by changing the conformation of the RNA (15Ghisolfi L. Joseph G. Amalric F. Erard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2955-2959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ghisolfi L. Kharrat A. Joseph G. Amalric F. Erard M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Nsr1p (17Lee W.C. Xue Z.X. Mélèse T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), Ssb1p (18Jong A.Y. Clark M.W. Gilbert M. Oehm A. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2947-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and Nop3p (19Russell I.D. Tollervey D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) contain copies of the typical RNA recognition motif, and it is therefore conceivable that the GAR domain cooperates with these RNA recognition motifs to enhance their function. For fibrillarin, the role of the GAR domain is less obvious since this protein has not been shown to interact directly with any RNA. Curiously, Gar1p has two GAR domains, one at each end of the protein, that together represent almost 40% of the total protein. Deletion of the two GAR domains of Gar1p leaves a central domain of only 104 residues that has no similarity with known RNA binding motifs and is sufficient to support cell growth and to target a fusion protein to the nucleolus (20Girard J.P. Bagni C. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Amalric F. Lapeyre B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18499-18506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result prompted us to investigate whether this short peptide had retained the ability to bind the snoRNAs. Therefore, to decipher the structure of the snoRNA-nucleolar protein complexes and to better understand the relationship between their different components, we undertook the analysis of the interactions existing between Gar1p and other members of these complexes. The present study provides evidence that Gar1p is able to interact in vitrodirectly and specifically with the two snoRNAs, snR10 and snR30. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae haploid strain used in this study was described previously (13Girard J. Lehtonen H. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Amalric F. Tollervey D. Lapeyre B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae cells were grown in minimal medium (SGal or SGlu: 0.67% yeast nitrogen base with 2% glucose or galactose) plus appropriate nutrients. Standard procedures for handling yeasts were essentially as described. The plasmids pT3/T7a18:10 and pT3/T7a18:30, which contain the genes coding for snR10 and snR30, were kindly provided by D. Tollervey (11Morrissey J.P. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The different constructions used to produce the deleted Gar1p were derived from a GAR1 open reading frame inserted into pTZ18R. 2J. P. Girard and B. Lapeyre, unpublished observations. Digestion with various restriction enzymes and subcloning of the appropriate polymerase chain reaction fragments were used to produce several Gar1p deletions. Transcription using T7 RNA polymerase was performed according to the supplier's instructions (Promega). RNA was purified over a G-25 spin column, phenol extracted, and ethanol precipitated before translation. Biotinylated RNAs were obtained by performing the transcription in the presence of 100 μm biotin-21-UTP (CLONTECH). Conditions were optimized to obtain RNA molecules containing a similar amount of biotin, as determined by avidin-alkaline phosphatase assay (Bio-reaction).35S-Labeled Gar1p derivatives were made in wheat germ extract according to the manufacturer (Promega) using 1 μg of mRNA in the presence of 15 μCi [35S]methionine (1200 Ci/mmol). The 35S proteins were stored at −20 °C and thawed and frozen several times without apparent loss of binding capacity. 1 fmol of 35S-Gar1p derivative was incubated with 1 pmol of RNA in a total volume of 30 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 9.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.25% Nonidet-P40) containing 4 μg of yeast tRNA. After 60 min at 30 °C, 350 μl of binding buffer and 7 μl of beads (Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin, Dynal) previously washed in the same buffer were added. After 90 min at room temperature, the beads were recovered using a magnet (Dynal MPC). The pellet was washed three times with 500 μl of binding buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted at 95 °C for 10 min in 15 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The supernatant was analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE, and exposed on Kodak film for 1–3 days. For competition experiments, the competitor RNA was mixed with the biotinylated RNA prior to incubation with the labeled protein. Cultures were grown in liquid medium to an A600:nm of 1, then RNA was extracted as described previously (21Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4169-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and analyzed by Northern blots. Gar1p had previously been shown to be co-immunoprecipitated with the two small nucleolar RNAs snR10 and snR30 (13Girard J. Lehtonen H. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Amalric F. Tollervey D. Lapeyre B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). To assess whether Gar1p was able to interact directly with the snoRNAs, we used a previously described assay (22Scherly D. Boelens W., van Venroaij J. Dathan N.A. Hamm J. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4163-4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 23Hamm J. Kazmaier M. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3479-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled Gar1p protein made in wheat germ extract is incubated with synthetic biotinylated RNA and a large excess of tRNA as a competitor for nonspecific interactions. Biotin-containing complexes are purified by precipitation with streptavidin coupled to magnetic particles, then the bound proteins are released and analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. About 50% of the input Gar1p is reproducibly precipitated by either snR10 or snR30 when the RNA molecules are biotinylated (Fig. 1,lanes c and e). No Gar1p is precipitated when nonbiotinylated RNA molecules are used (lanes b andd), indicating that the binding of the RNA to the magnetic beads coupled to streptavidin is specific for biotinylated molecules. The specificity of the interaction between Gar1p and the two snoRNAs is demonstrated by comparison with the two nonspecific RNA substrates (5′ETS rRNA from S. cerevisiae or human U1 snRNA,lanes f and g). The effect of the ionic strength on the stability of the RNA-protein complex has been tested. In contrast with the hnRNP U protein, which retains binding at 500 mm NaCl (14Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) and hnRNP A1, which retains binding at 250 mm NaCl (24Cobianchi F. Karpel R.L. Williams K.R. Notario V. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Nadler S.G. Merrill B.M. Roberts W.J. Keating K.M. Lisbin M.J. Barnett S.F. Wilson S.H. Williams K.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), Gar1p exhibits decreased binding to the two snoRNAs at 100 mm KCl and no binding at 500 mm KCl (Fig. 2). This is in contrast with the finding that native Gar1p was still associated with the intact snR30 RNP at 600 mm KCl (26Lubben B. Fabrizio P. Kastner B. Luhrmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11549-11554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (see "Discussion"). Then, we carried out competition experiments using as competitor either the other snRNA or nonspecific RNA. 35SLabeled Gar1p protein was incubated with biotinylated snR10 (or snR30) in the presence of increasing amounts of nonbiotinylated snR30 (or snR10, respectively) (Fig. 3). The nonbiotinylated competitor has little effect when present in equimolar amounts, but a 20 times molar excess almost completely abolishes the binding of Gar1p to the biotinylated RNA. A nonspecific competitor (ETS rRNA) is unable to displace the interaction of Gar1p with the two snoRNAs, emphasizing the specificity of these interactions. It is unlikely that Gar1p possesses separate sites for each RNA since it is now known that Gar1p is associated with a whole set of snoRNAs that present a common structure (1Balakin A.G. Smith L. Fournier M.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 823-834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 7Ganot P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Kiss T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 941-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The two GAR domains located at the two ends of Gar1p (N-GAR and C-GAR) are the most recognizable features of this protein. These domains are present in several other nucleolar proteins involved in RNA metabolism. Moreover, a distantly related glycine-rich domain (hnRNP U) was proposed to interact directly with single-stranded DNA and homopolymeric RNA (14Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the GAR domains of Gar1p could interact with the two snoRNAs. A series of deletions of Gar1p were constructed, and the corresponding proteins were tested for the ability to bind the RNAs. Fig. 4 A schematically presents the most informative of the constructions that have been tested and summarizes the results of the complementation experiments previously obtained (20Girard J.P. Bagni C. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Amalric F. Lapeyre B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18499-18506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) whenever they are available. The construction A (Fig. 4 A), that lacks the two GAR domains, is retained by the biotinylated snoRNAs (Fig. 4 B) although less efficiently than is the wild-type protein (wt), indicating that the GAR domains might contribute but are not absolutely required for the interaction. In contrast with the hnRNP U protein, the GAR domains are not sufficient under our experimental conditions to bind to the snoRNAs as exemplified by the construction E, which lacks part of the central domain but retains the GAR domains. The central region of Gar1p presents no remarkable features except for a stretch of basic amino acids rich in lysine and proline that resembles the nuclearization sequences found in many nuclear proteins. However, we have previously shown that this basic motif does not work as a nuclear targeting signal in S. cerevisiae and that its deletion does not impair the nucleolar accumulation of a reporter protein fused to Gar1p (20Girard J.P. Bagni C. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Amalric F. Lapeyre B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18499-18506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the advance of several genome sequencing projects, partial sequences for Gar1p fromDrosophila (X71975), Arabidopsis thaliana(T21476) (27Newman T., de Bruijn F.J. Green P. Keegstra K. Kende H. McIntosh L. Ohlrogge J. Raikhel N. Somerville S. Thomashow M. Retzel E. Somerville C. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1994; 106: 1241-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), and two species of Brassica (M64632 andM64633) are now available in addition to the sequences from S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe that we published earlier (13Girard J. Lehtonen H. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Amalric F. Tollervey D. Lapeyre B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 28Girard J. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Lapeyre B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2149-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). An alignment of the sequences for the central 109 amino acids of Gar1p (wherever it is available) from the five different species is presented (Fig. 5). Two regions of very striking homology are denoted Box-1 and Box-2. For instance, the 25 amino acids of Box-1, exhibit an average of 90% identity (more than 98% similarity) between the different species. For Box-2, the alignment is also excellent between the yeasts andDrosophila, whereas there is a significant variation for half of the box in A. thaliana. Since there are some uncertainties in this portion of the sequence for this species, it is possible that the sequence identity is even greater than presented. In addition to Box-1 and -2, there are a number of residues throughout the whole core that are either well or absolutely conserved in all the species examined. A deletion that removes a portion of Box-2 (Fig. 4 A, construction B; see also Fig. 5, position 124) almost completely abolishes the binding to either snR10 or snR30 (Fig. 4 B,lanes h and i). However, even when Box-2 is entirely removed, the presence of a GAR domain (construction C) can rescue in part the RNA binding activity. In contrast, any deletion affecting Box-1 abolishes the binding activity (construction D) even when the two GAR domains are present (construction E). Interestingly, the S. pombe Gar1p, which can substitute for its homologue in S. cerevisiae, is also able to interactin vitro with the two snoRNAs snR10 and snR30 from the budding yeast. 3C. Bagni and B. Lapeyre, unpublished observations. This result supports the idea that identical segments between the two proteins might bear the RNA binding activity. Recently, a thermosensitive allele of Gar1p has been isolated and described (29Bousquet-Antonelli C. Henry Y. Gélugne J.-P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Kiss T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4770-4776Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This mutant has multiple mutations that lead to six residue changes, from which the one(s) responsible for the phenotype has not yet been mapped. However, a valine at position 52 (Fig. 5) is the only residue affected that is invariant in the 5 species examined, making likely that this position is essential for the function of the protein. Since the deletion B was sufficient to support the growth of a yeast cell (20Girard J.P. Bagni C. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Amalric F. Lapeyre B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18499-18506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) while its ability to bind RNA in vitro was strongly impaired, we undertook a more careful examination of the strain harboring the construction B as the sole source of Gar1p. Microscopic examination reveals that the morphology of these cells is strongly altered (Fig. 6). Some are very large and rounded, whereas others are abnormally elongated with a shape resembling the cells starved for nitrogen (30Gimeno C.J. Ljungdahl P.O. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 1077-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Moreover, the budding site selection of these cells is deeply affected, and newly formed cells are heterogeneous in shape. We isolated the abnormal cells by micro manipulation to ascertain that the observed phenotype was not due to a loss of the plasmid carrying the modified GAR1 gene. In addition, we found that at 37 °C the division of these cells is strongly impaired; abnormally shaped cells and even dead cells are more prominent in the culture. To assess the effect of the various deletions of Gar1p on rRNA accumulation, the steady state levels of 18 S and 25 S rRNA were examined. No difference was observed for the deletions A and B as compared with the wild-type strain. However, for deletion E, synthesis of 18 S rRNA was completely abolished (data not shown) as previously reported for a strain depleted of Gar1p (13Girard J. Lehtonen H. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Amalric F. Tollervey D. Lapeyre B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) or for a strain expressing a conditional allele of GAR1 (29Bousquet-Antonelli C. Henry Y. Gélugne J.-P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Kiss T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4770-4776Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Finally, we addressed the question of the fate of the snoRNAs in vivo in the differentGAR1 mutants. RNAs prepared from different mutants were analyzed by Northern blots, using clones corresponding to snR10 or snR30 as probes (Fig. 7). Neither snR10 nor snR30 appear to be destabilized in the mutant strains. This confirms previous report that in strains deprived of Gar1p by the use of a GAL inducible version of Gar1p (13Girard J. Lehtonen H. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Amalric F. Tollervey D. Lapeyre B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), or carrying a thermosensitive allele of Gar1p, snoRNA steady state is not changed (29Bousquet-Antonelli C. Henry Y. Gélugne J.-P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Kiss T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4770-4776Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The nucleolus contains a very large number of species of snoRNAs that can be present in the cell in both small (10–15 S) and large (70–90 S) particles, indicating that snoRNPs could exist in the cell as individual particles or that they could associate with each other and/or with the pre-rRNA following a complex pattern of affinities and interactions (31Maxwell E.S. Fournier M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 897-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). To understand how the processing machinery operates, it is necessary to provide a better description of the composition of the snoRNPs and of the interactions between their constituents. We report here that Gar1p binds directly and specifically to snR10 and snR30 in vitro. It is noteworthy that this binding is salt-sensitive in contrast to the previous report that the association between Gar1p and the snoRNP snR30 was resistant to high salt washes (26Lubben B. Fabrizio P. Kastner B. Luhrmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11549-11554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). One possibility is that the optimal interaction between Gar1p and its RNA target requires another protein with which Gar1p could associate. Another possibility is that Gar1p alone binds its target, but to be fully active, it requires some protein modifications that thein vitro translated protein is lacking. For instance, the arginine residues of the GAR domain have been shown to be dimethylated in mammalian nucleolin (32Lapeyre B. Amalric F. Ghaffari S.H. Rao S.V. Dumbar T.S. Olson M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9167-9173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This modification could stabilize the interaction of the protein with its target RNA. The most striking feature of the Gar1p sequence is the presence of two GAR domains, which are present in several nucleolar proteins involved in pre-rRNA processing. However, we previously showed that the two GAR domains of Gar1p are not necessary for the cell growth and are not required to target a reporter protein to the nucleolus (20Girard J.P. Bagni C. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Amalric F. Lapeyre B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18499-18506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, deletion analysis has revealed that the two GAR domains are not sufficient to bind specifically to the snoRNAs and are not essential for the binding but that they contribute to the binding when they are associated with another RNA binding domain. Together, these observations support the hypothesis that the GAR domains have an accessory role in binding the RNA and are dispensable in vivo. Deletion analysis has revealed a complex organization of the core of the protein in two major domains. Domain I is 60 residues long, extends from residues 37 to 96, and encompasses 9 of the highly invariant positions as well as Box-1. Domain II extends from residues 97 to 146 and contains 5 highly conserved residues and Box-2. It is noticeable that although Domain I and II do not contain any canonical motifs, Box-1 exhibits some similarities with Snm1p, a protein component of the RNase mitochondrial RNA processing (33Schmitt M.E. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2617-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with a putative yeast DNA-polymerase and with several ATP-synthases. It is thus possible that, in addition to its RNA binding activity, this domain bears also some catalytic activity. The well conserved residues located upstream from Box-1 must also play a major role since a deletion removing these residues up to position 54 (Fig. 5) abolishes the complementation activity (20Girard J.P. Bagni C. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Amalric F. Lapeyre B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18499-18506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Domain I is able to complement the growth of a cell lacking the wild-type Gar1p to accumulate a reporter protein to the nucleolus, and to specifically bind the snoRNAs in vitro but only when it is linked to either a GAR domain or to Domain II. Domain II, alone or associated with the two GAR domains, does not have any of these properties either in vitro or in vivo. It is interesting to note that construction B, which contains Domain I and II but lacks three residues of Box-2, has very little RNA binding activityin vitro. However, it is sufficient to support cell growth and nucleolar targeting in vivo. We conclude from these experiments that Box-2 is required for the RNA binding in vitro, but this requirement can be overridden by the addition of a GAR domain. It seems that in vivo the lack of a complete Box-2 can also be partially compensated, even in the absence of a GAR domain, probably due to other proteins. For instance, other nucleolar GAR proteins may compensate for a defect in unwinding activity. Alternatively, this function could be achieved by RNA helicases since it has recently been shown that an allele for the putative RNA helicase Rok1p was synthetically lethal with a thermosensitive allele of GAR1 (34Venema J. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Gelugne J.P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3398-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is likely that Box-2 performs other functions in vivo, since its deletion is lethal for the cell (20Girard J.P. Bagni C. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Amalric F. Lapeyre B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18499-18506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At least two different hypothesis could explain the abnormal morphology observed for the cells harboring the construction B. It is conceivable that an abnormal Gar1p leads to a defect in ribosome synthesis that alters the translation of certain factors involved in cell proliferation and bud site selection. A more direct consequence of the Gar1p mutation could result from a change in nucleolar organization and/or function. It has been observed that the location of the nucleolus depends on cell polarity since it is always located on the opposite side of the spindle pole body, that in itself points toward the future bud site. It is an interesting possibility that a modification of the nucleolus could result in an abnormal cell polarity. The finding that the major RNA binding element coincides with Domain I, which is also required for nucleolar targeting as well as for the essential functions or Gar1p, supports the view that the snoRNAs and the protein could be co-transported to the nucleolus and that the association between Gar1p and the snoRNAs is likely to be essential for the complex to perform its function. Since the interaction between Gar1p and the snoRNAs in vitro is salt-sensitive, it is conceivable that Gar1p interacts in vivo with some of the other proteins that have been reported to be associated with the snR30 RNP to provide a tighter interaction. Interestingly, depletion of Gar1p (13Girard J. Lehtonen H. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Amalric F. Tollervey D. Lapeyre B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 29Bousquet-Antonelli C. Henry Y. Gélugne J.-P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Kiss T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4770-4776Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), does not lead to snoRNA instability. This result suggests that Gar1p does not belong to the core of the particles and that other proteins may bind the RNAs and protect them from being degraded in thegar1 mutant cells. The characterization of these proteins should allow the description of the structure of the snoRNPs to build up. We thank I. Mattaj for the gift ofU1 snRNA and U1A plasmids and D. Tollervey for providing SNR10 and SNR30 genes. We are grateful to F. Amalric for his continuous support and to colleagues in Toulouse for their help and fruitful discussions.

TITLE: Plant-soil feedbacks and the resource economics spectrum
ABSTRACT: Zia Mehrabi 2 Centre for Sustainable Food Systems and Institute for Resources Environment and 3 Sustainability, University of British Columbia, Canada. 4 Email: zia.mehrabi@ubc.ca 5 Summary 6 • Recent work suggests that resource economic traits might help predict the strength and 7 direction of plant-soil feedback interactions, both in natural systems and in agriculture. 8 However, there are many competing hypotheses to explain the effects of plant resource 9 economics on plant-soil feedbacks. 10 • Faster-growing plants may have positive fertilizing effects if their tissues are incorporated 11 and mineralized by soil microbes, but may also have negative effects if pathogens build 12 up or fungal symbionts are lost through fertilization. Identifying the direction of effects 13 may be confounded if nutrients are exported through herbivory, leaching, or crop 14 harvesting. 15 • To determine causality in the effect of plant traits on plant-soil feedbacks it is essential 16 for plant-soil feedback experiments to (1) quantify the mass of nutrients held in standing, 17 or harvested plant biomass, and in losses to other sources in the field, and (2) undertake 18 soil chemistry measurements (e.g. gross and net nitrogen mineralization) of nutrients 19 limiting for plant growth throughout all phases of the feedback cycle. 20 • If rigorous nutrient budgeting in plant-soil feedback research is more widely practiced 21 this will provide the data needed to synthesise results in comparable ways, and will 22 enable mechanistic insights into the role of plant traits in mediating plant competition in 23 both natural and applied settings. 24

TITLE: Cytokeratin 18 Is Expressed on the Hepatocyte Plasma Membrane Surface and Interacts with Thrombin-Antithrombin Complexes
ABSTRACT: During experiments to identify putative hepatic receptors for thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes, a 45-kDa protein was identified by ligand blotting. Following gel purification, amino acid sequencing revealed the 45-kDa TAT-binding polypeptide to be cytokeratin 18 (CK18). The presence of CK18 on the surface of intact rat hepatoma cells was demonstrated by binding of125I-anti-CK18 antibodies. Anti-CK18 antibodies reduced the binding and internalization of 125I-TAT by rat hepatoma cells. Immunocytochemical analysis, to determine the location of CK18 in vivo, revealed a periportal gradient of CK18 staining; with hepatocytes around the portal triads demonstrating striking pericellular staining. In addition, anti-CK18 IgG associated with perfused livers to a significantly greater extent than preimmune IgG. Taken together, these data provide evidence that CK18 is found on the extracellular surface of hepatocytes and could play a role in TAT removal. Finally, these data, in conjunction with recent reports of CK8 (Hembrough, T. A., Li, L., and Gonias, S. L. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 25684–25691) and CK1 cell membrane surface expression (Schmaier, A. H. (1997) Thromb. Hemostasis 78, 101–107), indicate a novel role for these proteins as putative cellular receptors or cofactors to cellular receptors. During experiments to identify putative hepatic receptors for thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes, a 45-kDa protein was identified by ligand blotting. Following gel purification, amino acid sequencing revealed the 45-kDa TAT-binding polypeptide to be cytokeratin 18 (CK18).

Finally, these data, in conjunction with recent reports of CK8 (Hembrough, T. A., Li, L., and Gonias, S. L. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 25684–25691) and CK1 cell membrane surface expression (Schmaier, A. H. (1997) Thromb. Hemostasis 78, 101–107), indicate a novel role for these proteins as putative cellular receptors or cofactors to cellular receptors. The generation and regulation of thrombin is of central importance in the maintenance of hemostasis (1Fenton II, J.W. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1988; 14: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Antithrombin, the main physiological regulator of thrombin, is a 60-kDa glycoprotein synthesized by the liver and found in plasma at a concentration of 2–5 μm (2Rosenberg R.D. Damus P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6490-6505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the regulation of thrombin by antithrombin is demonstrated by the fact that individuals with inherited antithrombin deficiency have an increased tendency to develop thrombosis (3Blajchman M.A. Austin R.C. Fernandez-Rachubinski F.F. Sheffield W.P. Blood. 1992; 80: 2159-2171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sheffield W.P. Wu Y.I. Blajchman M.A. High K.A. Roberts H.R. Molecular Basis of Thrombosis and Hemostasis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 355-377Google Scholar) The inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin is catalyzed by heparin and related naturally occurring glycosaminoglycans. This property of heparin accounts for its widespread clinical use as an anticoagulant and antithrombotic agent (5Hirsh J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1565-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar).Antithrombin is a member of the protein superfamily known as theserine proteinase inhibitors orserpins (6Hunt L.T. Dayhoff M.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 95: 866-871Google Scholar). The serpin family includes both inhibitory proteins, which inhibit their cognate proteases, and proteins with no known inhibitory function. In addition to antithrombin, the inhibitory serpins include: α-AC, 1The abbreviations used are: α-AC, α1-antichymotrypsin; α-PI, α1-proteinase inhibitor; uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; PPACK,d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine-chloromethylketone; CK1, CK8, and CK18, cytokeratins 1, 8, and 18; HCII, heparin cofactor II; IF, intermediate filament; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; PAI-I and PAI-II, plasminogen activator inhibitors I and II; PN-1, protease nexin 1; SEC, serpin-enzyme complexes; SECR, SEC receptor; serpin, serine protease inhibitor; TAT, thrombin-antithrombin complexes; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: α-AC, α1-antichymotrypsin; α-PI, α1-proteinase inhibitor; uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; PPACK,d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine-chloromethylketone; CK1, CK8, and CK18, cytokeratins 1, 8, and 18; HCII, heparin cofactor II; IF, intermediate filament; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; PAI-I and PAI-II, plasminogen activator inhibitors I and II; PN-1, protease nexin 1; SEC, serpin-enzyme complexes; SECR, SEC receptor; serpin, serine protease inhibitor; TAT, thrombin-antithrombin complexes; TBS, Tris-buffered saline.α2-antiplasmin, α-PI, HCII, PAI-I, PAI-II, and PN-1 (7Carrell R.W. Pemberton P.A. Boswell D.R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The inhibitory serpins are suicide inhibitors which inhibit serine proteinases through the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric covalent serpin-enzyme complex (SEC), which renders both serpin and enzyme non-functional. Such complex formation results in a conformational change in the serpin moiety, that exposes residues believed to be responsible for SEC binding to putative hepatic receptors, and which consequently effect their removal from the circulation (8Pizzo S.V. Am. J. Med. 1990; 87: 10S-14SAbstract Full Text PDF Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Plasma elimination studies in experimental animals have demonstrated that SECs are removed much more rapidly than the corresponding native or cleaved serpin (reviewed in Refs. 8Pizzo S.V. Am. J. Med. 1990; 87: 10S-14SAbstract Full Text PDF Scopus (54) Google Scholar and 9Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G. Landes Co., Toronto, Ontario, Canada1996: 161-167Google Scholar). Such studies in mice, employing 125I-labeled SECs in competition with large excesses of non-radiolabeled SECs, suggest the presence of two distinct liver receptors for their removal. These putative receptors have been designated serpin receptors 1 and 2, respectively. Serpin receptor 1 appears to be responsible for the removal of SECs composed of the serpins antithrombin, α-PI, α-AC, or HCII, while serpin receptor 2 appears to be responsible for the removal of α2-antiplasmin-enzyme complexes (8Pizzo S.V. Am. J. Med. 1990; 87: 10S-14SAbstract Full Text PDF Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A hepatic receptor with binding characteristics similar to that of serpin receptor 1 has been identified on HepG2 cells, monocytes, and neutrophils and has been designated SECR (10Perlmutter D.H. Glover G.I. Rivetna M. Schasteen C.S. Fallon R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 11Joslin G. Griffin G.L. August A.M. Adams S.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1886-1893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A carboxyl-terminal pentapeptide of α-PI, putatively exposed upon complex formation and conserved throughout the serpins, was found to comprise the minimal necessary residues for binding to the SECR (13Joslin G. Fallon R.J. Bullock J. Adams S.P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11282-11288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking of this pentapeptide to a hepatoma plasma cell membrane protein has been reported to result in the formation of an adduct of ≈78 kDa, although neither the cloning nor the purification of this membrane protein has yet been reported (14Joslin G. Krause J.E. Hershey A.D. Adams S.P. Fallon R.J. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21897-21902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) has also been demonstrated to bind a number of different SECs, including TAT (15Kounnas M.Z. Church F.C. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) receptor (16Conese M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8215-8220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have also been reported to bind different SECs. In this study, we provide evidence that CK18 may also represent a TAT receptor, or a cofactor to such a receptor.Cytokeratins are members of the IF family of proteins that are found primarily in epithelial tissues (21Moll R. Franek W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4495) Google Scholar, 22Abe M. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). IFs interact to form filamentous cytoplasmic networks that run from the surface of the nucleus to the plasma membrane (23Okanoue T. Ohta M. Fushiki S. Ou O. Kachi K. Okuno T. Takino T. S. French S.W. Hepatology. 1985; 5: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24French S.W. Kawahara H. Katsuma Y. Ohta M. Swierenga S.H.H. Electron Microsc. Rev. 1989; 2: 17-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All IFs are composed of a central α-helical rod domain which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains (reviewed in Refs. 25Coulombe P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1993; 5: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26Steinert P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 729-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). At least 30 different cytokeratin proteins have been identified in epithelial tissues and carcinomas, and these are grouped into two main types: type I, which are acidic; and type II, which are neutral to basic proteins. Unlike other IF proteins, cytokeratins are obligate heteropolymers, requiring the presence of both type I and type II proteins to form filaments (28Steinert P.M. Idler W.W. Zimmerman S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 108: 547-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Within each type of cytokeratin there is high homology in the α-helical rod domains, but with notable diversity in the head and tail domains. Despite the diversity in these domains, all cytokeratins form morphologically similar filaments, implying the primary importance of the α-helical domains in filament formation. The sequence heterogeneity in the head and tail domains, along with the diversity of tissue expression, indicates that individual cytokeratins have specialized functions within cells in addition to the ability to form filaments (26Steinert P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 729-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar).Recently, the view that cytokeratins and other intracellular proteins are confined solely to the cytosol has been challenged. Within the last 5 years, a number of investigators have provided evidence that various intracellular proteins are expressed also on the surface of cells and function as receptors for different plasma ligands. For example, cell surface actin has been reported to bind Factor Va, angiogenin, plasminogen, tissue plasminogen activator, and lipoprotein(a) (29Furmiak-Kazmierczak E. Nesheim M.E. Cote G.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 30Moroianu J.W. Fett J.W. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Haematol. 1996; 95: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); α-actinin to thrombospondin (32Dubernard V. Faucher D. Launay J.-M. Legrand C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar); annexin II to plasminogen (33Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and nucleolin with various lipoproteins (34Semenkovich C.F. Ostlund R.E. Olson M.O.J. Yang J.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9708-9713Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Relevant to this present report, CK8 has been reported to be a receptor for plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator (35Hembrough T.A. Vasudevan J. Allieta M.M. Glass II, W.F. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1071-1082PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hembrough T.A. Li L. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25684-25691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); and recently CK1 has been demonstrated to be an endothelial cell receptor for high molecular weight kininogen (37Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the present study, data are provided from biochemical, cell culture, immunocytochemical, and liver perfusion studies which support the identification of CK18 as a TAT-binding protein on the hepatocyte surface.DISCUSSIONThe present studies were undertaken to identify the putative receptor(s) responsible for removal of TAT complexes from the circulation. During the course of these studies CK18 was identified as a TAT-binding protein associated with the plasma membranes of hepatocytes. This conclusion was based on the following observations: 1) TAT-binding protein from rabbit liver plasma membranes has high sequence homology to human CK18; 2) TAT-binding protein has a similar electrophoretic mobility to CK18; and 3) the insolubility of the TAT-binding protein in various detergents, a physical property of most IF proteins. The potential physiological relevance of TAT interaction with CK18 is suggested by: 1) the inhibition of 125I-TAT binding to cultured hepatoma cells by anti-CK18 antibodies; 2) the ability of anti-CK18 antibodies to inhibit 125I-TAT internalization; 3) immunolocalization of CK18 on the surface of hepatoma cells in culture; and 4) the specific association, in perfusion experiments, of anti-CK18 antibodies with livers.Our findings are difficult to reconcile with an exclusive intracellular localization of CK18. Moreover, CK8 has been detected on the cell surface of primary hepatocytes, HepG2 cells, and human breast carcinoma cells (35Hembrough T.A. Vasudevan J. Allieta M.M. Glass II, W.F. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1071-1082PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hembrough T.A. Li L. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25684-25691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 46Donald P.J. Cardiff R.D. He D. Kendall K. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg. 1991; 105: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Additionally, CK1 also has been demonstrated recently to be present on the cell surface of endothelial cells (37Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The cell surface localization for cytokeratins is also supported by surface labeling studies of cultured carcinoma cells (47Godfroid E. Geuskens M. Dupressoir T. Parent I. Szpirer C. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 595-607PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the cell surface localization of predominantly intracellular proteins is not unprecedented, as shown by the detection of α-actin on the surface of calf and human endothelial cells by immunofluorescence microscopy (30Moroianu J.W. Fett J.W. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3815-3819Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Dudani A.K. Ganz P. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 95: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).The interaction of serpin-enzyme complexes with four other cell surface membrane proteins has previously been reported; these include LRP, gp330, uPA receptor, and SECR. Of these TAT specifically has been reported to interact with LRP and SECR (10Perlmutter D.H. Glover G.I. Rivetna M. Schasteen C.S. Fallon R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 12Joslin G. Wittwer A. Adams S. Tollefsen D.M. August A. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In the present study, the affinity of TAT for hepatic-binding sites appears to be low (ranging from 100 to >500 nm). However, this is not dissimilar to other studies which indicate low affinity TAT binding to SECR (10Perlmutter D.H. Glover G.I. Rivetna M. Schasteen C.S. Fallon R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 12Joslin G. Wittwer A. Adams S. Tollefsen D.M. August A. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1886-1893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as purified LRP (15Kounnas M.Z. Church F.C. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Specific TAT binding to monocytoid cells had a K d ≈ 80 nm(48Takeya H. Hamada T. Kume M. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1334-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), while TAT binding to HepG2 cells was found to have aK d ≈ 247 nm (49Fair D.S. Plow E.F. Thromb. Res. 1986; 41: 67-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the present studies, the use of the SECR-binding pentapeptide did not inhibit125I-TAT binding to rabbit liver plasma membranes while a 20-fold molar excess of cold TAT inhibited binding by ≈50%. In other studies, similar molar excesses of TAT were found to reduce the SECR-binding pentapeptide, α-PI-elastase, and TAT binding to HepG2 cells to a similar degree (10Perlmutter D.H. Glover G.I. Rivetna M. Schasteen C.S. Fallon R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 12Joslin G. Wittwer A. Adams S. Tollefsen D.M. August A. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1886-1893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although SECR and LRP have both been reported to interact with TAT, there is evidence to suggest that TAT also interacts with other proteins. Thus, Takeya et al. (48Takeya H. Hamada T. Kume M. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1334-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) demonstrated that TAT bound to a receptor distinct from the SECR. Similar to the findings of this present study, the SECR-binding pentapeptide did not inhibit TAT, or α-AC-cathepsin G complex binding to cells (48Takeya H. Hamada T. Kume M. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1334-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 50Chen M. Conn K.-J. Festoff B.W. Neurology. 1993; 43: 1223-1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, alterations in the SECR-binding pentapeptide consensus sequence for HCII have been shown to have no effect on HCII-thrombin complex binding to HepG2 cells (51Maekawa H. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18604-18609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Despite its low affinity for TAT, LRP has been shown to be the vehicle for TAT internalization in vivo in rats (15Kounnas M.Z. Church F.C. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, although LRP has been shown to be involved in the internalization of TAT and other SEC, other proteins are very likely the initial binding sites for such complexes. In addition to TAT having low apparent affinity for LRP, its binding to purified LRP appears very slow (an 18-h incubation was used in binding experiments) (15Kounnas M.Z. Church F.C. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This slow binding is not in keeping with the known very rapid removal rate for TAT in vivo. Moreover, some investigators have found no evidence for TAT binding to purified LRP (48Takeya H. Hamada T. Kume M. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1334-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Recently a PN-1 peptide was found to be a potent inhibitor of PN-1-thrombin internalization by LRP, but this peptide was found not to inhibit PN-1-thrombin binding to the cell surface; supporting the possibility that TAT could bind to a receptor protein other than LRP (52Knauer M.F. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12261-12264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This scenario is not unprecedented as uPA-PAI and uPA-PN-1 complexes have been shown to bind to the uPA receptor before being internalized through interaction with LRP (16Conese M. Olson D. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17886-17892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Conese M. Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Cremona O. Pardi R. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. Blasi F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).Is there evidence to link CK18 and LRP? CK8 and CK18 have been reported to be found in a complex with the uPA receptor and protein kinase C in the plasma membranes of WISH cells (53Busso N. Masur S.K. Lazega D. Waxman S. Ossowski L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Additionally, an unidentified plasma membrane glycoprotein of 85 kDa was co-immunoprecipitated from a variety of epithelial cell lines with CK18 (54Chou C.-F. Riopel C.L. Omary M.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This unidentified protein could represent the β subunit of LRP, as it had similar biochemical traits. Finally, although the histochemical experiments do not provide direct evidence of CK18 cell surface expression in vivo, they provide an intriguing coincidental pattern of expression with that seen for LRP, in that LRP is also preferentially expressed in hepatocytes proximal to the portal triads (55Voorschuur A.H. Kuiper J. Neelissen J.A.M. Boers W. Van Berkel T.J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations support the hypothesis that CK18 may be the initial TAT-binding protein on hepatocytes, leading to subsequent interaction with LRP.High sequence homology in the rod domains of intermediate filaments indicate the necessity of these regions for the formation of filaments, yet the high sequence divergence of the head and tail regions would seem to indicate the possibility of functional differences between the different cytokeratins unrelated to their cytoskeletal role. Recently, the COOH-terminal domain of CK8 has been demonstrated to be expressed on the surface of breast mammary carcinoma cells and to be necessary for plasminogen binding (36Hembrough T.A. Li L. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25684-25691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CK8 has been demonstrated to augment the tissue-plasminogen activator activation of plasminogen on the cell surface and in the media of cultured breast mammary carcinoma cells (36Hembrough T.A. Li L. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25684-25691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 56Hembrough T.A. Kralovich K.K. Li L. Gonias S.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, the transfection of mouse L fibroblasts with CK8 and CK18 resulted in their increased migration and invasion of matrigel (57Chu Y.-W. Runyan R.B. Oshima R.G. Hendrix M.J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4261-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This novel functional role for cytokeratins is probably mediated by their acting as cell surface receptors (35Hembrough T.A. Vasudevan J. Allieta M.M. Glass II, W.F. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1071-1082PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hembrough T.A. Li L. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25684-25691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).At this time the true role for CK18 in TAT removal from the circulation is unclear. However, in this study we provide evidence for the biochemical interaction between TAT and CK18 as well as the presence of CK18 on the surface of cultured hepatic cells and hepatocytes in liver perfusion experiments. These data thus support the hypothesis that cytokeratins may represent cellular receptors at the hepatocyte cell surface. CK18 may thus be involved in the interaction of TAT, as well as other SECs, with hepatocytes. Such interactions are likely mediated by the variable head and tail domains of cytokeratins as has recently been demonstrated for CK8 for plasminogen binding (36Hembrough T.A. Li L. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25684-25691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and CK1 for high molecular weight kininogen (37Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Along with the growing body of evidence for surface expression of intracellular proteins, our data indicate potentially new and physiologically relevant roles for cytokeratins as putative cellular receptors, and/or as cofactors of cellular receptors. The generation and regulation of thrombin is of central importance in the maintenance of hemostasis (1Fenton II, J.W. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1988; 14: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Antithrombin, the main physiological regulator of thrombin, is a 60-kDa glycoprotein synthesized by the liver and found in plasma at a concentration of 2–5 μm (2Rosenberg R.D. Damus P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6490-6505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the regulation of thrombin by antithrombin is demonstrated by the fact that individuals with inherited antithrombin deficiency have an increased tendency to develop thrombosis (3Blajchman M.A. Austin R.C. Fernandez-Rachubinski F.F. Sheffield W.P. Blood. 1992; 80: 2159-2171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sheffield W.P. Wu Y.I. Blajchman M.A. High K.A. Roberts H.R. Molecular Basis of Thrombosis and Hemostasis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 355-377Google Scholar) The inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin is catalyzed by heparin and related naturally occurring glycosaminoglycans. This property of heparin accounts for its widespread clinical use as an anticoagulant and antithrombotic agent (5Hirsh J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1565-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Antithrombin is a member of the protein superfamily known as theserine proteinase inhibitors orserpins (6Hunt L.T. Dayhoff M.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 95: 866-871Google Scholar). The serpin family includes both inhibitory proteins, which inhibit their cognate proteases, and proteins with no known inhibitory function. In addition to antithrombin, the inhibitory serpins include: α-AC, 1The abbreviations used are: α-AC, α1-antichymotrypsin; α-PI, α1-proteinase inhibitor; uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; PPACK,d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine-chloromethylketone; CK1, CK8, and CK18, cytokeratins 1, 8, and 18; HCII, heparin cofactor II; IF, intermediate filament; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; PAI-I and PAI-II, plasminogen activator inhibitors I and II; PN-1, protease nexin 1; SEC, serpin-enzyme complexes; SECR, SEC receptor; serpin, serine protease inhibitor; TAT, thrombin-antithrombin complexes; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: α-AC, α1-antichymotrypsin; α-PI, α1-proteinase inhibitor; uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; PPACK,d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine-chloromethylketone; CK1, CK8, and CK18, cytokeratins 1, 8, and 18; HCII, heparin cofactor II; IF, intermediate filament; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; PAI-I and PAI-II, plasminogen activator inhibitors I and II; PN-1, protease nexin 1; SEC, serpin-enzyme complexes; SECR, SEC receptor; serpin, serine protease inhibitor; TAT, thrombin-antithrombin complexes; TBS, Tris-buffered saline.α2-antiplasmin, α-PI, HCII, PAI-I, PAI-II, and PN-1 (7Carrell R.W.

TITLE: Close encounters of the three morphs: does color affect aggression in a polymorphic lizard?
ABSTRACT: Color polymorphism is genetically controlled and the process generating and maintaining morphs can affect speciation and/or extinction rates. Competition and aggression among morphs can contribute to polymorphism maintenance and color badges are useful signals in intraspecific communication, because they convey information about alternative strategies and avoid unnecessary conflicts. This could lead to an uneven spatial distribution of morphs in a population, because the local frequency of each morph establishes the intensity of the competition in that neighborhood, and then the fitness of each male. We used a polymorphic lizard, Podarcis muralis, to assess if aggression varies among morphs under two contrasting hypotheses: a heteromorphic vs. a homomorphic aggression. We used laboratory mirror tests after lizard color manipulation and we verified the results consistency with the analysis of the spatial distribution of morphs in a wild population. Both the experiments confirmed that aggression is morph-specific and notably homomorphic. The adoption of behavioral alternative strategies that minimize risks and costs of unwanted conflicts could facilitate the stable coexistence of the phenotypes and reduce the resource competition. A bias in aggression to like-coloured males would advantage rarer morph, which would suffer less harassment by common morphs and obtain a fitness advantage. This process would be negatively-frequency-dependent and would stabilize polymorphism in the populations, possibly leading to sympatric speciation.

TITLE: Transfer and bioaccumulation of pesticides in terrestrial arthropods and food webs: State of knowledge and perspectives for research
ABSTRACT: Arthropods represent an entry point for pesticide transfers in terrestrial food webs, and pesticide accumulation in upper chain organisms, such as predators can have cascading consequences on ecosystems. However, the mechanisms driving pesticide transfer and bioaccumulation in food webs remain poorly understood. Here we review the literature on pesticide transfers mediated by terrestrial arthropods in food webs. The transfer of pesticides and their potential for bioaccumulation and biomagnification are related to the chemical properties and toxicokinetic of the substances, the resistance and detoxification abilities of the contaminated organisms, as well as by their effects on organisms' life history traits. We further identify four critical areas in which knowledge gain would improve future predictions of pesticides impacts on terrestrial food webs. First, efforts should be made regarding the effects of co-formulants and pesticides mixtures that are currently understudied. Second, progress in the sensitivity of analytical methods would allow the detection of low concentrations of pesticides in small individual arthropods. Quantifying pesticides in arthropods preys, their predators, and arthropods or vertebrates at higher trophic level would bring crucial insights into the bioaccumulation and biomagnification potential of pesticides in real-world terrestrial food webs. Finally, quantifying the influence of the trophic structure and complexity of communities on the transfer of pesticides could address several important sources of variability in bioaccumulation and biomagnification across species and food webs. This narrative review will inspire future studies aiming to quantify pesticide transfers in terrestrial food webs to better capture their ecological consequences in natural and cultivated landscapes.

TITLE: There and back again: A sperm's tale
ABSTRACT: In the mid-20th century, two Swedish biologists—Åke Franzén and Bjorn Afzelius—significantly advanced the study of sperm biology through the investigation of sperm ultrastructure using the newly developed electron microscope. Franzén studied sperm in some 200 (mostly marine) invertebrate species, linking sperm form and structure to the fertilization environment. Most notably, Franzén found that sperm of external fertilizers were relatively small and of the "primitive" type, while animals with internal sperm transfer tended to have more elongated and modified sperm morphologies (Franzén l955, 1956a, 1956b). In similarly ground-breaking work, Afzelius provided the first documentation of pores in the sperm nucleus membrane, the first high-magnification image of the acrosome reaction, and discovered the dynein arms on the microtubule doublets of the sperm flagellum, the latter providing clues to the mechanism of sperm motility (Afzelius, 1957, 1959). These findings stimulated research on sperm structure and function, prompted the use of sperm ultrastructure as a phylogenetic and taxonomic tool, and motivated investigations of the role of cilia and flagella in human disease. Given the striking variation in sperm size and shape observed across the animal kingdom—the sperm cell is now recognized as the most diverse cell type known (Pitnick, Hosken, & Birkhead, 2009)—it is perhaps not surprising that there is still much to learn. Indeed, the desire to understand sperm structure and function that drove Franzén and Afzelius still motivates researchers today. The biology of spermatozoa (BoS) meetings were established in the early 1990's by Tim Birkhead and Harry Moore, both from the University of Sheffield, as a forum to advance knowledge of sperm biology, through the exchange of ideas across a range of disciplines including evolutionary biology, cell physiology, and human reproductive health. As an added bonus, these biennial meetings took place in the beautiful English countryside of the Peak District. In 2019, BoS moved to the Swedish town of Nynäshamn for the 15th BoS meeting. Under the direction of the international steering committee—comprised of Rhonda Snook (Stockholm University), John Fitzpatrick (Stockholm University), David Hosken (University of Exeter), Scott Pitnick (Syracuse University), Lukas Schärer (University of Basel), and Nina Wedell (University of Exeter)—this new venue was a resounding success. All the things that have made previous BoS meetings so successful were carried over to Sweden. With no concurrent sessions and presentations focused on unpublished and in-progress research with 15 min allocated to discussion, the meeting provided the perfect environment for the cross-fertilization of research ideas and discussion of emerging topics and methodologies. BoS15 also continued the tradition of inviting 2–3 speakers whose research offers new perspectives and approaches from other disciplines. An amazing scientific program, combined with a venue that allowed for discussion long into the night and a walk along the beautiful Nynäshamn coast, meant that BoS15 was the perfect blend of the old and the new. Kicking off the BoS15 scientific program, Tim Birkhead (University of Sheffield) transitioned the 80 BoS delegates from the Peak District of England to the Swedish coastal town of Nynäshamn with the greatest of ease with his opening plenary talk. By first acknowledging the contributions of Franzén and Afzelius to sperm biology, it was almost as if BoS was "back home again." Birkhead then took us on a stroll down memory lane, reliving the highlights of BoS over the years and reminding attendees of why this meeting is just so good, and the reasons for why we all keep coming back. It has been said by many a BoS attendee, that this meeting is their favorite professional conference. The warm and welcoming environment, provided by the steering committee and attendees, makes this conference feel like a family "catch-up," not to mention the high-quality research presented and thought-provoking new ideas that keep the study of gamete biology moving forward in new directions. Once bitten by a BoS meeting, there is no turning back. The 15th BoS meeting merged the old and the new in more ways than one. Following in the footsteps of Frankén and Afzelius, several talks focused on explaining the causes and consequences of sperm variation. Kristin Hook (University of Maryland) combined electron microscopy with computer-assisted-sperm-analysis methods to unravel the functional significance of complex sperm morphology and sperm aggregate behavior, as well as the role female promiscuity plays in the evolution of these traits. Using modern phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis methods, Ariel Kahrl (Stockholm University) shed new light on the role of the fertilisation environment for the evolution of sperm size. Compiling data on more than 3,000 animal species, this work linked evolutionary transitions in fertilisation environment to shifts in both sperm size and the rate of sperm evolution, providing compelling evidence for the evolution of longer sperm, and a higher rate of evolutionary change in sperm size in internally fertilizing taxa compared with those with external fertilisation. Exemplifying the community nature of these BoS meeting, Kahrl et al plan to make this resource publicly available in the future (SpermTree.org). Finally, Sara Calhim (University of Jyvaskyla) reminded us of how much more we have to learn about sperm variation and the benefit of studying "novel" animal groups by introducing to us the weird and wonderful world of tardigrade sperm. Sperm with no apparent mitochondria or floating mitochondria. Sperm with baton, spiral, or filamentous head shapes. Not to mention the morphological changes sperm undergo when they are inside the female versus in the male testis. Importantly, anyone can contribute to this work by sending samples of moss (the home to these little water bears) to Calhim. Check out how to do that here: Like many BoS meetings before this one, the focus was not entirely on sperm. This was exemplified by the plenary talk "The other gamete: development and evolution of eggs, inside and out" by Cassandra Extavour (Harvard University). Extavour presented an incredible collection of data on egg size and shape variation in insects, where egg volume ranges across eight orders of magnitude, and demonstrated the link between the evolution of egg morphological diversity and ecology (Church, Donoughe, de Medeiros, & Extavour, 2019a). For example, where eggs are laid helps to explain egg variation, with eggs laid in or on water or in the bodies of other animals tending to be smaller, while eggs laid on soil tend to be larger. Reflecting the movement towards open science, Extavour et al have made this database publicly available (Church, Donoughe, de Medeiros, & Extavour, 2019b). Extavour also described how insect embryos are built; detailing years of collaborative research from her lab investigating nuclei movement within the cytoplasm during blastoderm formation and impressing us with videos of nuclei movement captured using long-term cell tracking. Female diversity was also the topic of Patty Brennan's talk (Mount Holyoke College), who showcased vaginal diversity in dolphins and discussed the potential roles of natural and sexual selection in shaping vaginal morphology. Intriguingly, this variation in vaginal morphology does not appear to be explained by phylogeny, but instead appears likely to reflect the coevolution of male and female genital morphology and may provide a mechanism by which females can regulate copulatory success. Since the early days of the BoS meetings, researchers have understood the need to better integrate female-mediated processes into the study of sperm biology and sperm competition (Pitnick & Karr, 1995). The 15th BoS meeting showed how far we have come, with the presented research demonstrating our greater understanding of the dynamic interactions between ejaculates and the female reproductive tract and/or reproductive fluids. We now know that the female reproductive tract provides a selective and interactive environment through which sperm must navigate. Several talks highlighted the role that postmating female–male interactions play on sperm function, female behavior, and, ultimately, reproductive success. These complex interactions were the focus of the first day's plenary talk by Sabine Koelle (University College in Dublin), whose research focuses on reproductive medicine and assisted reproductive technologies in humans. Koelle wowed us all with her videos of sperm swimming within the female reproductive tract under near "in vivo" conditions, which were obtained using a newly developed technique—probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy. Koelle's work evoked a great deal of discussion throughout the meeting. This work highlighted the fact that a sperm's journey to the oocyte may be even more complicated than previously thought, questioning the importance of sperm motility versus female reproductive tract contractions for sperm transport. Additionally, Koelle's work suggested fertilization success may be more dependent upon an intact sperm membrane, rather than normal sperm morphology. This is because damage to the membrane impedes the ability of sperm to locate the oocyte. Therefore assessing sperm membrane integrity may be an important assessment tool when investigating idiopathic infertility for humans and animals. Also highlighting the importance of male–female interactions, Emma Whittington (Syracuse University) described how the Drosophila melanogaster sperm proteome changes after being transferred to the female. Whittington provided a framework for thinking about the interactive role the female reproductive tract and fluids play in post-ejaculatory modifications to sperm. Next, Yasir Ahmed-Braimah (Syracuse University), created a vibrant discussion about postmating immune responses. Ahmed-Braimah demonstrated that mating triggers immune responses in the female reproductive tract, with ejaculates from heterospecific males mounting a greater immune response than conspecific ejaculates. Nathan Clark's plenary talk (University of Utah) showed us that male–female interactions in the cabbage white butterfly can be a veritable "battle of the sexes." In this system, males deposit a large spermatophore, which consists of a virtually indestructible hard outer shell with a soft nutritious inner shell surrounding a ball of sperm, in the female reproductive tract (bursa copulatrix). The spermatophore's nutritious inner shell acts as a nuptial gift. However, because the female cannot mate when the bursa copulatrix is filled and it takes 3 days for the female to break down the hard outer shell of the spermatophore, the spermatophore functions to prevent female remating. To combat this, female butterflies produce proteases in the bursa copulatrix which help to chemically digest the spermatophore and, even more impressively, the bursa copulatrix contains an organ called the signum, "a tooth-like structure" which mechanically chews through the spermatophore's outer shell. To top it off, Clark demonstrated that both the female proteases and male spermatophore proteins are rapidly evolving. Altogether, this was an amazing story of sexual conflict and cooperation. Male–female interactions are also critical in external fertilizers. Neil Gemmell (University of Otago) highlighted the importance of female–male interactions as the ovarian fluid, surrounding the unfertilized ova, contains proteins that can speed up or slow down the sperm from "hooknose" male chinook salmon. Similarly, using a broadcast spawner, the blue mussel, Jon Evans (University of Western Australia) showed that female derived water surrounding the eggs, can also hinder or enhance the sperm function. Egg water acts as a chemoattract to guide sperm, but also acts to select against extreme combinations of sperm length and sperm swimming speed. Sperm function and performance can also be influenced by seminal fluid, setting the stage for complex male–male interactions within the female reproductive tract. This was beautifully demonstrated by Mariana Wolfner (Cornell University), who intrigued us with her research on Drosophila seminal fluid and the idea of copulation complementation. It seems that Drosophila males exploit seminal fluid sex-peptides produced by rival males, with the second male to mate effectively "rescuing" the first male's fertility. Stefan Lüpold (University of Zurich) moved the conversation forward again by elegantly demonstrating the complexities of male–male–female interactions and highlighting the multivariate nature of selection on sperm form and function. The environment also impacts reproduction, and several talks on the final afternoon focused on the consequences of changes in the thermal environment for gamete biology and fertility or the impact of social environment on reproductive plasticity. Ramakrishnan Vasudeva (University of East Anglia) showed that temperature increases through adult development resulted in males producing shorter sperm and females producing larger eggs. Moreover, Vasudeva found that this gamete plasticity is adaptive, with pairs showing greater reproductive performance when males and females were exposed to matching thermal conditions. Next up, Benjamin Walsh (University of Liverpool) introduced the concept of "thermal fertility limits" (i.e., the level and duration of thermal stress that renders individuals unable to reproduce; Walsh et al., 2019). Walsh reviewed empirical evidence for the effects of elevated temperatures on reproduction and fertility and recommended the use of standardized approaches to measuring thermal fertility limits. Given that rising global temperatures and increases in the frequency and duration of heatwave events are threatening biodiversity on a global scale, this work is timely and impactful. Finally, the presentation sessions were wrapped up by Suzanne Alonzo (University of California Santa Cruz) who reminded us of the "social side" of sperm competition. Alzono discussed how social and gametic traits in the ocellated wrasse, whereby males exhibit three alternative male reproductive types, interact to help us understand the dynamics of sexual selection. In this species, male types differ in sperm quantity and quality; the next big question is whether they also differ in cognitive function. As in previous years, the poster sessions were a critical component of BoS15. Kicking of each of the two posters sessions, presenters "advertised" their posters with a 1-min research pitch that infused a generous dose of fun into the sessions, and John Fitzpatrick was poised nearby with the timer to catch out anyone who went over the 1-min mark. The posters showcased a diversity of high-quality research covering a broad range of topics, including cognitive mechanisms of sperm allocation in junglefowl (Yunke Wang, University of Oxford), environmental effects on sperm gene expression (Rowan Lymbery, University of Western Australia), and sperm adaptation to microbes (Oliver Otti, University of Bayreuth). The female side of reproduction was also well-represented, with posters covering topics such as female reproductive tract protein evolution in Drosophila (Caitlin McDonough, Syracuse University) and the role of female body condition on cryptic female choice via ovarian fluid in wrasse (Matthew Kustra, University of California, Santa Cruz). Finally, several of this year's posters highlighted research on postmating prezygotic reproductive barriers in a range of invertebrate systems, including butterflies (Melissa Plakke, University of Kansas), Drosophila (Martin Garlovsky, University of Sheffield), and beetles (Erica Larson, University of Denver). Alas, after three and a half days of cutting-edge science and rousing discussion, our meeting was over, and a merry group of gamete biologists farewelled each other and commenced their journey home. We are already looking forward to the next meeting, which will again be held in Nynäshamn on September 6–10th, 2021 ( Though BoS meetings are typically small, with just 60–80 delegates, new attendees are always welcome and encouraged to inject new ideas and enthusiasm for the study of sperm biology. So mark down the dates for the 16th BoS meeting in your calendar now. We thank all presenters at the 2019 BoS conference for showcasing their research, and all conference attendees for the thoughtful and exciting discussions on gamete biology. We thank John Fitzpatrick, Rhonda Snook, and two anonymous reviewers for comments on earlier versions of the manuscript. The authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.

TITLE: Protein-Level Interactions as Mediators of Sexual Conflict in Ants*
ABSTRACT: All social insects with obligate reproductive division of labor evolved from strictly monogamous ancestors, but multiple queen-mating (polyandry) arose de novo, in several evolutionarily derived lineages. Polyandrous ant queens are inseminated soon after hatching and store sperm mixtures for a potential reproductive life of decades. However, they cannot re-mate later in life and are thus expected to control the loss of viable sperm because their lifetime reproductive success is ultimately sperm limited. In the leaf-cutting ant Atta colombica, the survival of newly inseminated sperm is known to be compromised by seminal fluid of rival males and to be protected by secretions of the queen sperm storage organ (spermatheca). Here we investigate the main protein-level interactions that appear to mediate sperm competition dynamics and sperm preservation. We conducted an artificial insemination experiment and DIGE-based proteomics to identify proteomic changes when seminal fluid is exposed to spermathecal fluid followed by a mass spectrometry analysis of both secretions that allowed us to identify the sex-specific origins of the proteins that had changed in abundance. We found that spermathecal fluid targets only seven (2%) of the identified seminal fluid proteins for degradation, including two proteolytic serine proteases, a SERPIN inhibitor, and a semen-liquefying acid phosphatase. In vitro, and in vivo, experiments provided further confirmation that these proteins are key molecules mediating sexual conflict over sperm competition and viability preservation during sperm storage. In vitro, exposure to spermathecal fluid reduced the capacity of seminal fluid to compromise survival of rival sperm in a matter of hours and biochemical inhibition of these seminal fluid proteins largely eliminated that adverse effect. Our findings indicate that A. colombica, queens are in control of sperm competition and sperm storage, a capacity that has not been documented in other animals but is predicted to have independently evolved in other polyandrous social insects.

When females mate with multiple males, i.e., are polyandrous, conflicts over paternity continue after mating if sperm from different males compete for storage and egg fertilization, a process referred to as sperm competition. Due to conflicting reproductive interests between the sexes, female reproductive tracts have evolved discrimination mechanisms to secure appropriate mate choice and reproductive success despite sperm competition constraints (1.Birkhead T.R.

Sociobiol. 2006; 60: 289-310Crossref Scopus (379) Google Scholar), as is particularly well documented in Drosophila, where the sex peptide has a range of effects on female reproductive physiology and behavior (11.Liu H.

These interactions may serve joint reproductive interests, but they tend to primarily favor male interests while reducing future reproductive success of females (12.Avila F.W. Sirot L.K.

Such sexual conflicts are often influenced by dynamic coevolutionary arms races, where molecular mechanisms are difficult to disentangle particularly when rates of re-mating are unpredictable. Females affect the outcome of sexual conflicts via defensive sexual strategies, but they are unlikely to gain ultimate control when re-mating continues to expose them to new male ejaculates (12.Avila F.W.

Sexually antagonistic male adaptation triggered by experimental arrest of female evolution.Nature. 1996; 381: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). The mating systems of Atta, leaf-cutting ants offer unique opportunities to study male-female protein interactions during insemination and sperm storage. Queens and males have large body sizes and ejaculates are transferred directly to the spermatheca, the queen's sperm storage organ, where they encounter both rival ejaculates and queen-derived secretions (14.Liberti J. Baer B. Boomsma J.J. Queen reproductive tract secretions enhance sperm motility in the ants.Biol. Lett. 2016; 12: 20160722Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These characteristics imply that artificial insemination is a feasible experimental approach for emulating natural insemination (15.den Boer S.P.A. Boomsma J.J. Baer B. A technique to artificially inseminate leafcutter ants.Insectes Sociaux. 2013; 60: 111-118Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Because queens never re-mate later in life (16.Boomsma J.J. Baer B. Heinze J. The evolution of male traits in social insects.Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2005; 50: 395-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), selection can produce both female enhancement mechanisms of sperm preservation after insemination (14.Liberti J. Baer B. Boomsma J.J. Queen reproductive tract secretions enhance sperm motility in the ants.Biol. Lett. 2016; 12: 20160722Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and mechanisms to terminate sperm competition if it compromises future female reproductive success (17.den Boer S.P.A. Baer B. Dreier S. Aron S. Nash D.R. Boomsma J.J. Prudent sperm use by leaf-cutter ant queens.Proc. R Soc. B-Biol. Sci. 2009; 276: 3945-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Directly after mating, Atta, queens must individually dig a burrow to establish a new colony. Thus, Atta, queens face a series of trade-offs when allocating metabolic resources to control sexual conflict and maximize survival during solitary colony-founding under significant constraints of resource availability and disease pressure (17.den Boer S.P.A. Baer B. Dreier S. Aron S. Nash D.R. Boomsma J.J. Prudent sperm use by leaf-cutter ant queens.Proc. R Soc. B-Biol. Sci. 2009; 276: 3945-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18.Baer B. Armitage S.A. Boomsma J.J. Sperm storage induces an immunity cost in ants.Nature. 2006; 441: 872-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We previously found that SF of A. colombica, males reduces survival of rival sperm in vitro, a process known as sperm incapacitation, and that the queen's spermathecal secretions terminate this process of competitive elimination (19.den Boer S.P. Baer B. Boomsma J.J. Seminal fluid mediates ejaculate competition in social insects.Science. 2010; 327: 1506-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Here we conducted a series of experiments to unravel the molecular basis of these male-male and male-female interactions. We first show that the in vitro, incapacitation effects of SF on sperm of other males are due to proteins (20.den Boer S.P. Stürup M. Boomsma J.J. Baer B. The ejaculatory biology of leafcutter ants.J. Insect. Physiol. 2015; 74: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and that the interactions between SF and spermathecal fluid (SpF) are also protein based. This implies that proteins play crucial roles in the phenotypic expression of sperm competition and its termination. In a second step, we used a quantitative proteomics approach by mixing SF with SpF to identify the proteins that are targeted for degradation using differential in gel electrophoresis (DIGE). In a third step, to assess whether focal proteins originated from male or female secretions, we conducted a full proteome analyses of both SF and SpF, which allowed us to identify the SF proteins that are degraded by SpF. Finally, we performed an in vivo, artificial insemination experiment and in vitro follow-up trials with general and specific protease inhibitors to obtain phenotypic confirmation for these SF proteins being molecular agents and counteragents of sperm competition. The experimental procedures and results are presented in this order in the sections below. All ant sampling and fieldwork was done in May (2008–2016) at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Gamboa, Republic of Panama. Male and virgin queens of A. colombica, were dug out of specific colonies around Gamboa. Male sexual maturity was confirmed by dissecting subsamples of individuals to verify that testes had degenerated and all sperm had been transferred to the accessory testes (ATs), which are enlarged sections of the vas deferens used for the storage of mature sperm prior to ejaculation (21.Holldobler B. Bartz S.H. Sociobiology of reproduction in ants.in: Holldobler B. Experimental Behavioral Ecology. G. Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart1985: 237-257Google Scholar). Virgin queens were assumed to be sexually mature when found in fungus-garden chambers close to the surface and when their cuticles had become dark brown. All dissections were conducted using Inox 5 watchmaker forceps in Hayes saline solution (9 g NaCl, 0.2 g CaCl2, 0.2 g KCl, and 0.1 g NaHCO3 in 1,000 ml H20) as used for our previous studies (22.den Boer S.P.A. Boomsma J.J. Baer B. Seminal fluid enhances sperm viability in the leafcutter ant Atta colombica.Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol. 2008; 62: 1843-1849Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An overview of the experimental procedures of this section is given in Fig. 1. To obtain SF, the accessory glands (AGs) of 60 males originating from two different A. colombica, colonies were dissected in 200 μl Hayes, ruptured with forceps, and vortexed for 3 min before centrifugation for 3 min at 13,500 g,. The supernatant of all AGs was pooled, and 48 ml of Hayes was added to create a 60 ml stock solution and stored at −20 °C. This solution represented the contents of ∼2 AGs/ml, which seemed a reasonable approximation because: 1) Protein concentrations in natural ejaculates are unknown, and 2) males can inseminate multiple queens and allocate some unknown fraction of their total complement of SF to each ejaculate. The concentrations that we used are therefore most likely to be lower than in natural ejaculates, so the effects we quantified can be regarded as conservative estimates of the protein-level interactions as they occur in nature. To obtain SpF, we collected 30 virgin queens from four different colonies and artificially inseminated (i.e., transferred using an artificial insemination technique) 20 μl of Hayes saline into the spermatheca of each queen as described previously (15.den Boer S.P.A. Boomsma J.J. Baer B. A technique to artificially inseminate leafcutter ants.Insectes Sociaux. 2013; 60: 111-118Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The queens were sacrificed after 60 min, dissected, and their spermathecae ruptured in Hayes saline. The samples were then vortexed for 3 min, followed by centrifugation for 3 min at 13,500 g, to separate SpF from tissue residues. The supernatant from all 30 queens was pooled, after which half of this SpF stock solution was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and suspended in Hayes resulting in a final concentration of ca. 1 spermatheca fluid complement per milliliter, i.e., a comparable protein concentration as in the AG samples. The second half of the SpF stock solution was separated into a high molecular weight (HMW) fraction, mainly containing protein molecules >3 kDa, and a low low molecular weight (LMW) fraction, most likely containing peptide and metabolite molecules <3 kDa, using a centrifugal filter device (AMICON Ultrafree Centrifugal Filters 3 kDa, Millipore, Bayswater, VIC, Australia) for 30 min at 13,500 g,. Both fractions were resuspended in Hayes saline to reach the original volume of 15 ml (Fig. 1). An additional 20 males were collected from a single A. colombica, colony that was not used previously for any of the reproductive fluid collections described above (Fig. 1). This new colony allowed us to obtain five 1 μl samples of sperm dissected from the ATs of each of these males, which were diluted in: (T1) 1 ml of AG suspension of the same male collected as described above, (T2) a 1 ml aliquot of the AG stock suspension (from 60 rival males from one of the previous colonies), (T3) a 0.5 ml aliquot of the AG stock suspension and 0.5 ml of the SpF stock solution (collected from 30 queens), (T4) 0.5 ml AG stock suspension and 0.5 ml of the LMW fraction of the SpF stock solution, and (T5) 0.5 ml AG stock suspension and 0.5 ml of the HMW fraction of the SpF stock solution. A 5-μl aliquot of each of the treatment samples was used to estimate sperm survival with a Live/Dead sperm viability kit (Molecular Probes, Mulgrave, VIC, Australia) and using an earlier developed protocol (22.den Boer S.P.A. Boomsma J.J. Baer B. Seminal fluid enhances sperm viability in the leafcutter ant Atta colombica.Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol. 2008; 62: 1843-1849Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A minimum of 300 sperm cells per treatment were scored as live or dead using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus CX41, EXFO X-Cite 120, filter cube CX-DMB-2 and 800x magnification). Counting was performed blindly in relation to treatment and data analysis was performed in JMP, version 11.0.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), for Windows using generalized linear models with a binomial error structure and logit link function. Sperm origin (male identity) was included as a random factor, number of live sperm as dependent variable, and the total number of sperm counted per replicate as binomial denominator. To identify the proteins involved in sexual conflict, we used DIGE to detect protein abundance changes when SF encounters SpF in the experimental design summarized in Fig. 2. DIGE compares protein abundances between multiple proteomes of interest while maintaining their key properties such as isoelectric point and molecular weight (MW). In order to minimize experimental variation, samples are labeled with different fluorescent dyes before being separated by 2D-PAGE. An internal standard, labeled with a separate fluorescent dye, allows comparison between samples run on different gels. Although DIGE has limited detection efficiency for proteins with extreme isoelectric points, unusual MWs, posttranslational modifications, and nonstandard amino acid sequences (23.Arentz G. Weiland F. Oehler M.K. Hoffmann P. State of the art of 2D DIGE.Proteom Clin. Appl. 2015; 9: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), it is a well-established method for obtaining quantitative data on changes in abundance of intact and fragmented proteins, which was the main objective of our study. Four biological replicates of SF were collected from four colonies by squeezing a male's abdomen between two fingers to induce ejaculation and collecting 2–4 μl of outflowing semen per male (15.den Boer S.P.A. Boomsma J.J. Baer B. A technique to artificially inseminate leafcutter ants.Insectes Sociaux. 2013; 60: 111-118Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 20.den Boer S.P. Stürup M. Boomsma J.J. Baer B. The ejaculatory biology of leafcutter ants.J. Insect. Physiol. 2015; 74: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Each biological replicate originated from a separate colony and the SF was collected from ∼350 males per colony. Each replicate was divided into 100 μl aliquots, and assigned to one of the following treatments: (1) untreated SF controls, (2) SF transferred to the spermatheca using artificial insemination and retrieved after 30 min, and (3) SF transferred to the spermatheca in the same way and retrieved after 12 h (Fig. 2). Because leaf-cutting ant queens never re-mate later in life to replenish stored sperm (20.den Boer S.P. Stürup M. Boomsma J.J. Baer B. The ejaculatory biology of leafcutter ants.J. Insect. Physiol. 2015; 74: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that queens should have been under strong selection to quickly intervene in male-driven sperm incapacitation. The 30-min time point is a reasonable estimate for the duration of naturally occurring mating flights of Atta, queens when they are inseminated by 2–5 males with a median of 2–3 (18.Baer B. Armitage S.A. Boomsma J.J. Sperm storage induces an immunity cost in ants.Nature. 2006; 441: 872-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Our selection of 12 h as second time point was also purposefully considered because by that time queens will have terminated all mating activities and finalized digging a nest burrow to initiate a new colony. In each of the two different treatments, we transferred 10 μl of SF to the spermathecae of 10 queens and allowed them to recover for 30 min or 12 h before dissecting them to obtain the spermathecal content as described above. Recovered spermathecal contents (transferred SF plus SpF) were then pooled per treatment and replicate, resulting in a total of 12 samples (three treatments with four biological replicates, see Fig. 2). Proteins were precipitated by adding 4x volumes of ice-cold acetone to each sample for 4 h at −20 °C and centrifuging at 14,000 g, for 10 min, after which supernatants were discarded and the protein pellets were stored at −80 °C until further use. For DIGE, we prepared all 12 samples as described in Bogaerts et al., (24.Bogaerts A. Baggerman G. Vierstraete E. Schoofs L. Verleyen P. The hemolymph proteome of the honeybee: Gel-based or gel-free?.Proteomics. 2009; 9: 3201-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and performed minimal labeling as described in Grassl et al., (25.Grassl J. Scaife C. Polden J. Daly C.N. Iacovella M.G. Dunn M.J. Clyne R.K. Analysis of the budding yeast pH 4–7 proteome in meiosis.Proteomics. 2010; 10: 506-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Each sample, containing 150 μg of protein, was resuspended in 100 μl of DIGE buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mm Tris, 1% DTT) and cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Diagnostic, Basel, Switzerland), sonicated four times for 30 s, and placed on ice for 1 min, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 g, for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples were desalted using the PlusOne Mini Dialysis Kit (GE Healthcare, Parramatta, NSW, Australia) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and dialyzed against DIGE buffer. IPG strips (24 cm Immobiline Drystrips pH 3–10 NL; GE Healthcare) were rehydrated overnight with DIGE buffer (DTT replaced by 1.2% DeStreak Reagent and 0.5% IPG buffer pH 3–10, both GE Healthcare). Each protein sample was minimally labeled with DIGE Cy3 fluorescent dye, and an internal standard containing equal amounts of each sample was labeled with Cy5 dye (GE Healthcare) according to manufacturer's instructions. Using cup loading, we loaded 100 μg proteins (50 μg per sample plus 50 μg of internal standard) in 150 μl of DIGE buffer using isoelectric focusing. Isoelectric focusing was performed with an IPGphor Manifold (GE Healthcare) at 20 °C allowing a maximum of 50 μA per strip using the following setup: 4 h at 300V, 3-h gradient to 600 V, 2-h gradient to 1,000 V, 2-h gradient to 3,500 V, 3-h gradient to 8,000 V, 5 h at 8,000 V (total 60,000 Vh). Strips were stored at −80 °C and thawed at room temperature prior to SDS-PAGE separation. Each strip was equilibrated twice at room temperature by incubation for 15 min in equilibration buffer (6 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 30% glycerol, 2% SDS) containing either 1% w/v DTT (reduction step) or 4% w/v iodoacetamide (alkylation step, in the dark). The second dimension was separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1 mm thick, 12%T, 2.6%C) and using a Hoefer SE90010NA at 10 °C for 1 h at 7 mA per gel overnight at 50 mA per gel. All gels were scanned using a Typhoon fluorescence scanner (GE Healthcare), and the resulting images were imported into Delta2D software (v 4.34, Decodon GmbH, Greifswald, Germany) for spot analyses. Each spot on the DIGE gels was inspected manually, and only spots present on at least three of the four gels per treatment were kept for further analyses. Principal component analysis was used to exclude one outlier gel belonging to the 30 min treatment and analyses of variance were used to test for significant differences in spot intensity between treatments, based on log-transformed ratios. Finally, we applied Student's t,-tests for pairwise post hoc, comparisons among treatments using the “p, values based on permutations” - all permutations and the “false discovery rate (FDR) - number of false positive spots should not be exceeded” corrections available in the Delta2D software. Protein spots with significant abundance differences (p, < 0.05) between treatments and fold-change differences larger than 2 were selected for protein identification. To do this, we silver-stained one gel per treatment group using a mass spectrometry (MS)-compatible protocol (26.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Mass spectrometric sequencing of proteins from silver stained polyacrylamide gels.Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7807) Google Scholar), then destained spots by incubating them in 15 mm K3[Fe(CN)6] and 50 mm Na2S2O3, and rinsed them in water until fully destained. Spots were then dehydrated in 100% ACN, followed by drying in a speed-vac and in-gel protein digestion with trypsin (Promega, Alexandria, VIC, Australia 20 ng/μl in NH4HCO3, pH 8.4) overnight at 37 °C. Tryptic peptide extraction was done in 70% ACN, 5% formic acid in 10 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.4) with sonication repeated three times. All supernatant extracts were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and stored at −20 °C. In order to identify the spots selected for MS, each tryptic digest was resuspended in 5% ACN, 0.1% formic acid, and filtered with Ultrafree Centrifugal Filters (Durapore, PVDF 0.2 μm, Millipore). The individual digests were analyzed with LC-MS/MS using a Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Agilent 6550 with a HPLC-Chip Cube and a large capacity C18 chip), coupled to an Agilent 1200 series HPLC and a 20-min gradient (5–35% ACN, 0.1% formic acid). Peak lists were generated using MassHunter Quantitative Analysis B.07.01. Data files were analyzed using a Mascot server (v. 2.5.1) against the A. colombica, total proteome (16,519 sequences; 7,007,606 residues, Acol_1.0, downloaded October 2016) (27.Nygaard S. Hu H. Li C.

Reciprocal genomic evolution in the ant-fungus agricultural symbiosis.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 12233Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) using the following settings: MS error tolerance ±100 ppm, MS/MS error tolerance ±0.5 Da, trypsin digestion, maximum missed cleavages tolerated as 1, peptide charge as 2+, 3+, and 4+, and the instrument selected electrospray ionization Q-TOF setting allowing for variable modifications: carbamidomethyl (C) and oxidation (M). We accepted protein identifications when at least three different peptides were detected with an overall MOlecular Weight Search (MOWSE) ion score greater than 30. We report all protein matches from each spot with a comparable Exponentially Modified Protein Abundance Index (emPAI) score. To distinguish whether proteins identified in our DIGE analysis were of male or female origin, we obtained proteomes of both SF and SpF, using a pooled SF sample of 25 males from five colonies as described above by squeezing their abdomens to collect 2–4 μl of ejaculate per male (15.den Boer S.P.A. Boomsma J.J. Baer B. A technique to artificially inseminate leafcutter ants.Insectes Sociaux. 2013; 60: 111-118Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 20.den Boer S.P. Stürup M. Boomsma J.J. Baer B. The ejaculatory biology of leafcutter ants.J. Insect. Physiol. 2015; 74: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The SF supernatant was collected from the pooled ejaculates after two centrifugations for 10 min at 13,500 g, to separate sperm from SF, before storing the final supernatant at −80 °C. SpF was obtained from four different colonies by collecting 10 virgin queens per colony and transferring 10 μl Hayes into their spermathecae using the same methodology as for artificial insemination. All 40 queens were allowed to recover for 12 h before retrieving the content of their spermathecae as described above. The SF and SpF samples went through reduction/alkylation as described above before trypsin digestion (1:20 enzyme: protein ratio, Promega) at 37 °C overnight. Samples were acidified to pH 3 with formic acid and separated by high pH C18-RP fractionation (28.Yang F. Shen Y. Camp 2nd, D.G. Smith R.D.

We performed a concatenated, high pH reversed-phase fractionation off line using an Agilent 1200 series HPLC configured with two J4SDS-2 guard columns (PolyLC, Columbia, MD) and a Xbridge™ C18 column (particle size 3.5 μm, inner diameter 4.6 × 250 mm (Waters, Milford, MA)). Peptides were fractionated using a gradient of 5–60% ACN (v/v) at a flowrate of 1 ml/min in 10 mm ammonium formate, pH 10/NH4OH. Fractio

TITLE: An Ecological and Evolutionary Framework for Commensalism in Anthropogenic Environments
ABSTRACT: The definition of commensal taxa should be based on dependency. The concept of anthrodependent taxa leads to new species categorised as commensal. Commensals give insight into selective pressures in rapidly changing environments. Commensalism within anthropogenic environments has not been extensively discussed, despite its impact on humans, and there is no formal framework for assessing this ecological relationship in its varied forms. Here, we examine commensalism in anthropogenic environments in detail, considering both ecological and evolutionary drivers. The many assumptions about commensalism and the nature of anthropogenic environments are discussed and we highlight dependency as a key attribute of anthropogenic commensals (anthrodependent taxa). We primarily focus on mammalian species in the anthropogenic-commensal niche, but the traits described and selective pressures presented are likely fundamental to many species engaged in intense commensal relationships with humans. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this largely understudied interaction represents an important opportunity to investigate evolutionary processes in rapidly changing environments.

We primarily focus on mammalian species in the anthropogenic-commensal niche, but the traits described and selective pressures presented are likely fundamental to many species engaged in intense commensal relationships with humans. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this largely understudied interaction represents an important opportunity to investigate evolutionary processes in rapidly changing environments. Commensal taxa (see Glossary) have been major contributors to the human-mediated biodiversity crisis [1Stenseth N.C. et al.Mice, rats, and people: the bio-economics of agricultural rodent pests.Front. Ecol. Environ. 2003; 1: 367-375Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 2Martin L.J. et al.Evolution of the indoor biome.Trends Ecol. Evol. 2015; 30: 223-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar], are implicated in zoonoses [3Capizzi D. et al.Rating the rat: global patterns and research priorities in impacts and management of rodent pests.Mamm. Rev. 2014; 44: 148-162Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar], and were possible sources of domesticates [4Larson G. Fuller D.Q. The evolution of animal domestication.Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 2014; 45: 271-295Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 5Zeder M.A. Pathways to animal domestication.in: Gepts P. Biodiversity in Agriculture: Domestication, Evolution and Sustainability. Cambridge University Press, 2012: 227-259Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar]; thus, they have a profound impact on life on Earth. However, many aspects of this relationship, and the ecological and evolutionary processes associated with commensal taxa, are surprisingly poorly understood. This stems from the seemingly simple definition of commensalism: a relationship where one species benefits (+) and the other species experiences no impact (0) [6Johnson N.C. et al.Functioning of mycorrhizal associations along the mutualism-parasitism continuum.New Phytol. 1997; 135: 575-585Crossref Scopus (1356) Google Scholar]. Observations of animals benefitting from anthropogenic environments often lead to the conclusion that these animals are undergoing commensal-specific evolution. There are many assumptions associated with this evolutionary process, which we break down in this paper. We contend that anthropogenic environments are highly unstable and do not entirely buffer commensal species from seasonality. Therefore, the evolution of commensal taxa is defined by their ability to become dependent on these unstable anthropogenic environments. Observations of commensal interactions have led researchers in fields such as archaeology and studies of domestication to categorise species as commensally dependent, but without providing a wider ecological context. For example, because there is currently no adequate ecology-based framework for commensal evolution, the view that feral dog populations are reasonable models for 'proto-domestic' forms (e.g., [4Larson G. Fuller D.Q. The evolution of animal domestication.Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 2014; 45: 271-295Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 7Coppinger R. Coppinger L. A Startling New Understanding of Canine Origins, Behaviour and Evolution. Scribner, 2001Google Scholar]) has not been assessed with sufficient rigour. The assumption that domestic dogs derive ultimately from commensal wolves, therefore remains a premise underpinning much of the research into dog domestication (e.g., [8Axelsson E. et al.The genomic signature of dog domestication reveals adaptation to a starch-rich diet.Nature. 2013; 495: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar]). Although wolves do engage in commensal relationships with humans as facultative scavengers (e.g., [9Boitani L. Ciucci P. Comparative social ecology of feral dogs and wolves.Ethol. Ecol. Evol. 1995; 7: 49-72Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar]), whether it is possible for a subgroup of wolves, prior to direct human interaction, truly to become a commensal taxon in the evolutionary sense remains untested. A review of the current usage of the term 'commensalism' in anthropogenic environments highlights how dependence is central to the understanding of commensal taxa. Here, we identify the unpredictability and instability of the anthropogenic niche as the primary selective pressures involved in the evolution of commensal species. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an ecological framework is required to: (i) identify the intensity of the relationship in order to define a taxon as commensal; (ii) assess the complexities of ecological systems associated with commensals; and (iii) assess selective pressures on commensal taxa that drive their evolution. We propose a new term for organisms that might represent the typical commensal condition in an anthropogenic environment: 'anthrodependent taxa' or 'anthrodependants' (Box 1).Box 1Previously Used Definitions of Species in Anthropogenic Environments (with Our Proposed New Category*)Commensal taxa (com-: sharing and -mensa: table)Commensalism in its original and simplest form specifies a relationship, represented as +/0, whereby one organism benefits (+) from another without causing deleterious effects to the other (0) [6Johnson N.C. et al.Functioning of mycorrhizal associations along the mutualism-parasitism continuum.New Phytol. 1997; 135: 575-585Crossref Scopus (1356) Google Scholar]. As applied to taxa, rather than relationships, it often refers to species living within houses [10Aplin K.P. et al.Evolutionary biology of the genus Rattus: profile of an archetypal rodent pest.in: Singleton G.R. Rats, Mice and People: Rodent Biology Management.

Ecol. 2004; 73: 878-888Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar]. More precisely, 'true commensals' live entirely in houses, 'occasional commensals' move between houses and outdoor habitats, and 'obligate commensals' are those that can only survive in an area because of their ability to occupy houses (e.g., black rats in northern Europe).Synanthropic and synurban taxa (syn-: together)These terms are used in studies of species that continue to live in areas that are occupied and altered by humans [83Baker P.J.

Commensal taxa (com-: sharing and -mensa: table) Commensalism in its original and simplest form specifies a relationship, represented as +/0, whereby one organism benefits (+) from another without causing deleterious effects to the other (0) [6Johnson N.C. et al.Functioning of mycorrhizal associations along the mutualism-parasitism continuum.New Phytol. 1997; 135: 575-585Crossref Scopus (1356) Google Scholar]. As applied to taxa, rather than relationships, it often refers to species living within houses [10Aplin K.P. et al.Evolutionary biology of the genus Rattus: profile of an archetypal rodent pest.in: Singleton G.R.

More precisely, 'true commensals' live entirely in houses, 'occasional commensals' move between houses and outdoor habitats, and 'obligate commensals' are those that can only survive in an area because of their ability to occupy houses (e.g., black rats in northern Europe). Synanthropic and synurban taxa (syn-: together) These terms are used in studies of species that continue to live in areas that are occupied and altered by humans [83Baker P.J. Harris S.

The term 'commensal', denoting a relationship, has a straightforward meaning [6Johnson N.C. et al.Functioning of mycorrhizal associations along the mutualism-parasitism continuum.New Phytol. 1997; 135: 575-585Crossref Scopus (1356) Google Scholar]. However, when the term is applied to a taxon (e.g., to rodents [10Aplin K.P. et al.Evolutionary biology of the genus Rattus: profile of an archetypal rodent pest.in: Singleton G.R. Rats, Mice and People: Rodent Biology Management. ACIAR, 2003: 487-498Google Scholar] or to a so-called 'proto-domestic' species [4Larson G. Fuller D.Q. The evolution of animal domestication.Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 2014; 45: 271-295Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar]), it often means something more complex, reflecting both the acquisition of a new capability to exploit the anthropogenic environment and an associated reliance upon it. Furthermore, as the relationship becomes more intense (one of dependence), these 'commensal taxa' rarely have a neutral impact on humans; for example, they consume crops, steal food, and/or harbour disease [3Capizzi D. et al.Rating the rat: global patterns and research priorities in impacts and management of rodent pests.Mamm. Rev. 2014; 44: 148-162Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 11Morand S. et al.Global parasite and Rattus rodent invasions: the consequences for rodent-borne diseases.Integr.

Rev. 2014; 44: 148-162Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar]. Their role as disease vectors might be considered a key negative impact [11Morand S. et al.Global parasite and Rattus rodent invasions: the consequences for rodent-borne diseases.Integr. Zool. 2013; 10: 409-423Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar], but it is entirely indirect, given that essentially no energy is expended to spread the disease (although parasite-induced behaviours exist [91Webster J.P. Rats, cats, people and parasites: the impact of latent toxoplasmosis on behaviour.Microbes Infect. 2001; 3: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar]). Competition for resources is understood to be a–/–relationship [6Johnson N.C. et al.Functioning of mycorrhizal associations along the mutualism-parasitism continuum.New Phytol. 1997; 135: 575-585Crossref Scopus (1356) Google Scholar], with more obvious direct interaction. However, the comparison between the impact of disease and the damage from competition is difficult to quantify and might suggest that, when present, the indirect pathogen impact has a greater and more acute effect than the direct competition resulting from crop consumption [3Capizzi D. et al.Rating the rat: global patterns and research priorities in impacts and management of rodent pests.Mamm. Rev. 2014; 44: 148-162Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar]. Also, should we take into account the ability of humans to mitigate such impacts when considering whether a relationship is largely neutral or otherwise? Another question that is raised by the quantification of interactions is whether negative interactions are overriding and additive or whether they can be balanced by beneficial activities. Feral cats are a possible commensal species; they carry toxoplasmosis, a disease known to affect humans [91Webster J.P. Rats, cats, people and parasites: the impact of latent toxoplasmosis on behaviour.Microbes Infect. 2001; 3: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar], but they also consume and regulate populations of other species known to carry many more diseases [11Morand S. et al.Global parasite and Rattus rodent invasions: the consequences for rodent-borne diseases.Integr. Zool. 2013; 10: 409-423Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar]. Feral cats consume competitors of humans (rodents), so if disease is not considered, does that then make the relationship mutual? Does the perceived beneficial behaviour of feral cats mitigate the negative impact they can have on humans? Ultimately, this extremely complex set of impacts affects the evolution of all organisms involved but, on an evolutionary ecology scale, it is currently unquantifiable. As a result, it might be best to simply categorise these interactions as fluctuating and complex rather than trying to define them as negative or neutral. Many so-called 'commensal' species have anything but a neutral relationship with humans [3Capizzi D. et al.Rating the rat: global patterns and research priorities in impacts and management of rodent pests.Mamm.

Ultimately, this extremely complex set of impacts affects the evolution of all organisms involved but, on an evolutionary ecology scale, it is currently unquantifiable. As a result, it might be best to simply categorise these interactions as fluctuating and complex rather than trying to define them as negative or neutral. Taxa categorised as 'commensal' are reasonably assumed to be exposed to selective pressures relating to their exploitation of the anthropogenic niche [12Pocock M.J.O. et al.Adaptations of animals to commensal habitats: population dynamics of house mice Mus musculus domesticus on farms.J. Anim. Ecol. 2004; 73: 878-888Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar]. However, just what the main characteristics of the anthropogenic niche are (beyond a simplistic view that it represents a concentration of resources associated in some way with humans) remains unexplored, and this has led to further broad assumptions being made about evolutionary pressures on proposed commensal taxa (e.g. [8Axelsson E. et al.The genomic signature of dog domestication reveals adaptation to a starch-rich diet.Nature. 2013; 495: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar]). Beyond the obvious settings of human-made structures and urban environments, it must also be recognised that agricultural environments are also subject to unpredictable and unseasonal human activity, resulting in 'unnatural' availability of resources. These too have a range of associated dependent taxa, often considered 'pests'. At low densities, such taxa might be considered to hold commensal relationships, but, as densities become higher, they might be viewed as competitors, although these categories are largely subjective. From an ecological and evolutionary perspective, these competing taxa inhabit an unpredictable and fluctuating anthropogenic environment similar to that experienced by many commensals and, therefore, can be considered anthrodependent with a commensal origin. Other discrepancies in definitions stem from a research bias towards small-bodied animals living in human-made structures [10Aplin K.P. et al.Evolutionary biology of the genus Rattus: profile of an archetypal rodent pest.in: Singleton G.R. Rats, Mice and People: Rodent Biology Management. ACIAR, 2003: 487-498Google Scholar, 12Pocock M.J.O. et al.Adaptations of animals to commensal habitats: population dynamics of house mice Mus musculus domesticus on farms.J. Anim. Ecol. 2004; 73: 878-888Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar]. Occupation of such structures sets an arbitrary definition of 'commensal taxa' with the result that comparisons of similar evolutionary processes experienced by large-bodied species are overlooked. In this way, a unifying definition and understanding is needed of 'commensal taxa' that allows an evolutionary understanding and is transferable between taxa (with varying body and home-range sizes) that occupy different anthropogenic environments and exploit diverse anthropogenic resources. Far more useful is to consider commensalism (and other related types of species interaction) in terms of the degree of dependence upon an anthropogenic niche (Figure 1). Dependency comes with both benefits and costs, which in turn drive the evolution of anthrodependent taxa [5Zeder M.A. Pathways to animal domestication.in: Gepts P. Biodiversity in Agriculture: Domestication, Evolution and Sustainability. Cambridge University Press, 2012: 227-259Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar]. Examining the selective pressures stemming from both benefits and costs provides a more appropriate framework that allows detailed insight into evolutionary processes specifically associated with past, present, and future anthropogenic environments. Only by interrogating the archaeological record will we gain a fuller understanding of the way such taxa evolve and adapt [13Weissbrod L. Biological indicators of occupation intensity: an environmental ethnoarchaeology of Maasai ettlements.in: Dean R.M. The Archaeology of Anthropogenic Environments. Illinois University Press, 2010: 295-320Google Scholar]. Humans have been actively altering the environment around them for thousands of years in what can be considered a form of niche construction [14Zeder M.A. Domestication as a model system for niche construction theory.Evol. Ecol. 2016; 30: 325-348Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar]. It is this constructed environment, and the abundance of resources within it, to which anthrodependent taxa have adapted and thrived. The extent of anthropogenic environments has increased through time [14Zeder M.A. Domestication as a model system for niche construction theory.Evol. Ecol. 2016; 30: 325-348Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar], as has the prevalence of commensal taxa [15Cucchi T. et al.On the trail of Neolithic mice and men towards Transcaucasia: zooarchaeological clues from Nakhchivan (Azerbaijan).Biol. J. Linn. Soc. 2013; 108: 917-928Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar]. The ability of a taxon to maintain access to anthropogenic environments dictates its success and evolution as an anthrodependant. In particular, this environment is often characterised by extreme and unpredictable fluctuations of resource availability and nest sites [12Pocock M.J.O. et al.Adaptations of animals to commensal habitats: population dynamics of house mice Mus musculus domesticus on farms.J. Anim. Ecol. 2004; 73: 878-888Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Newsome A.E. A population study of house-mice temporarily inhabiting a South Australian wheatfield.J. Anim. Ecol. 1969; 38: 341-359Crossref Google Scholar], characteristics that are frequently overlooked. It is often assumed that anthropogenic environments are more stable in terms of resource availability than are natural environments [17Anderies J.M. et al.Living in the city: resource availability, predation, and bird population dynamics in urban areas.J. Theor. Biol. 2007; 247: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar]. This is not always the case [12Pocock M.J.O. et al.Adaptations of animals to commensal habitats: population dynamics of house mice Mus musculus domesticus on farms.J. Anim. Ecol. 2004; 73: 878-888Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar]; neither was it likely to have been so throughout the past, when wild organisms first entered the anthropogenic niche [13Weissbrod L.

TITLE: A life-history trade-off gene with antagonistic pleiotropic effects on reproduction and survival in limiting environments
ABSTRACT: Although life-history trade-offs are central to life-history evolution, their mechanistic basis is often unclear. Traditionally, trade-offs are understood in terms of competition for limited resources among traits within an organism, which could be mediated by signal transduction pathways at the level of cellular metabolism. Nevertheless, trade-offs are also thought to be produced as a consequence of the performance of one activity generating negative consequences for other traits, or the result of genes or pathways that simultaneously regulate two life-history traits in opposite directions (antagonistic pleiotropy), independent of resource allocation. Yet examples of genes with antagonistic effects on life-history traits are limited. This study provides direct evidence for a gene— RLS1, that is involved in increasing survival in nutrient-limiting environments at a cost to immediate reproduction in the single-celled photosynthetic alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Specifically, we show that RLS1 mutants are unable to properly suppress their reproduction in phosphate-deprived conditions. Although these mutants have an immediate reproductive advantage relative to the parental strain, their long-term survival is negatively affected. Our data suggest that RLS1 is a bona fide life-history trade-off gene that suppresses immediate reproduction and ensures survival by downregulating photosynthesis in limiting environments, as part of the general acclimation response to nutrient deprivation in photosynthetic organisms.
