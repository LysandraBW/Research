Yet there is considerable debate about their nature, strength and overall importance. This debate stems in part from continued uncertainty about the ultimate mechanisms driving cascading effects. We present a synthesis of empirical evidence in support of one possible ultimate mechanism: the foraging‐predation risk trade‐offs undertaken by intermediary species. We show that simple trade‐off behaviour can lead to both positive and negative indirect effects of predators on plant resources and hence can explain considerable contingency on the nature and strength of cascading effects among systems. Thus, predicting the sign and strength of indirect effect simply requires knowledge of habitat and resource use by prey with regard to predators’ presence, habitat use and hunting mode. The synthesis allows us to postulate a hypothesis for new conceptualization of trophic cascades which is to be viewed as an ultimate trade‐off between intervening species. In this context, different predators apply different rules of engagement based on their hunting mode and habitat use. These different rules then determine whether behavioural effects persist or attenuate at the level of the food chain.",https://openalex.org/W2124528330,18df35641fa2f70b55c71fea350c10371168c5e8,0,True,0.9890607595443726,0
https://doi.org/10.1890/04-1249,RESOURCE COMPETITION MODIFIES THE STRENGTH OF TRAIT-MEDIATED PREDATOR–PREY INTERACTIONS: A META-ANALYSIS,"Only a fraction of the individuals in a given prey population are likely to be killed and consumed by predators. In contrast, nearly all individuals experience the chronic effects of predation risk. When threatened by predators, prey adopt defensive tactics whose costs can lead to reduced growth, maturation rates, survivorship, fecundity, or population density. This nonconsumptive impact of predation risk on prey is known as a ""trait-mediated interaction"" (TMI) because it results from changes in prey traits such as behavior or physiology. Ecological theory suggests that the strength of TMI effects will reflect a balance between the conflicting demands of reproduction vs. predator avoidance. Competitor density and resource availability are expected to alter the balance between these conflicting forces. We conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured TMI effect size while varying competitor and/or resource density. The threat of predation had an overall negative effect on prey performance, but the strength of this effect varied with the level of competition. High competition exacerbated the negative effect of intimidation on prey density but moderated the negative effect of intimidation on prey life history and growth. We discuss these results in light of previously published theoretical expectations. Our results highlight the variable and context-dependent nature of interspecific interactions.",https://openalex.org/W2044321783,970ddf8e9cc5c6ee0795cbf90ff98aec7e533baa,0,True,0.9932403564453125,0

To date, this work has primarily focused on the effects of predator-induced behavioral plasticity on communities. However, predator-induced morphological plasticity, which has been documented in many taxa, might also lead to trait-mediated indirect effects. Here, I examined how predators altered the behavior and morphology of larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and leopard frogs (R. pipiens) and how these phenotypic changes altered the outcome of competition between the two species. Competition in the absence of caged predators was asymmetric; when reared separately, leopard frogs grew more than wood frogs, but when competing (without predators), wood frogs grew faster than leopard frogs. The presence of caged predators reversed the outcome of competition between the two anuran prey. In the presence of larval dragonflies (Anax spp.) or caged mudminnows (Umbra limi), leopard frogs grew faster than wood frogs while total tadpole biomass production remained unchanged. Thus, there was a predator-mediated indirect effect. Because predators alter both the behavior and morphology of larval anurans and both of these traits are known to affect resource consumption and growth, both are potential mechanisms to explain the change in competitive outcome. Changes in behavior were not related to changes in growth, but changes in morphology (specifically mouth width and tail length) were related to changes in growth. When competitors were added (without predators), wood frogs increased their mouth width by 10% and their tail length by 3%, while leopard frogs increased their mouth width by 5% and did not change their tail length. The greater increase in mouth width for wood frogs should increase their forage intake, since tadpoles feed by scraping periphyton; the importance of a 3% longer tail in competitive ability is unknown. The presence of the predator threat (via chemical cues from the caged predators) reduced both the mouth width and tail length in the two prey species to pre-competition levels. This response corresponded with the reduced competitive ability of the wood frogs. This work demonstrates that both competitors and predators can alter prey morphology and suggests that changes in morphology can cause trait-mediated indirect effects.",https://openalex.org/W2134929066,e4d8a15a418be329b5684ad74502f3627fd762dd,0,True,0.9667327404022217,0

Furthermore, since most biological communities are not simple food chains but complex networks of interactions, one TMII within a community might easily be influenced by another TMII. In other words, TMII themselves can be cascades with potential implications for community dynamics. Here we report on one of such cascade, where a parasitic fly induces behavioral changes that disrupt a trait-mediated ant–hemipteran mutualism. We show that during parasite-induced low-activity periods, the ant Azteca instabilis fails to protect its mutualistic scale-insect partner against predatory ladybeetles. Thus, in the presence of the parasite, ladybeetles ate as many scales in ant-patrolled plants as they did in ant-free plants. These results demonstrate how, through a cascade of trait-mediated interactions, associations between members of a community can be drastically altered.",https://openalex.org/W2162163837,d9609c9a08a2427b8848a5deb001b03a7483b0b5,0,True,0.9337142109870911,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-9563.2008.00427.x,"Trophic promiscuity, intraguild predation and the problem of omnivores","Does anybody else miss the good old days of trophic levels? When predators, herbivores and plants knew their place and interacted in appropriate linear chains (Hairston et al., 1960; Oksanen, 1981)? We released biological control agents under the optimistic assumption that they would attack their designated prey, more or less, and at least leave organisms at other trophic levels well alone. We built management programmes and mathematical models based on this assumption (Berryman, 1992). We lived in simpler times. No longer. Omnivores, apparently, are everywhere, practicing their trophic promiscuity in complex and dynamic fashion (Rosenheim, 2007). Predators eat predators, herbivores and, incorrigibly, sometimes plants (Coll & Guershon, 2002). Food chains have become passé, replaced by reticulate webs that defy our simple notions of stability as well as all sense of propriety (Polis et al., 1989; Holt & Polis, 1997). We are face to face with the uncomfortable reality that our agents of control often eat more broadly than we would like them to. We live in the days of the omnivores. Ecologists who work in unmanaged systems have long been acquainted with the vexing issue of omnivory. Random food webs built on Lotka–Volterra predator–prey equations become less stable with omnivory (Pimm, 1982), unless the omnivorous compartments (or loops) within the webs are characterized by weak links (Neutel et al., 2007) or nonlinearities (McCann & Hastings, 1997). In other words, omnivory should be either rare or weak for systems to persist. Yet omnivory is apparently ubiquitous (Denno & Fagan, 2003; Arim & Marquet, 2004) and, judging by a casual glance at the ants alone, the links are hardly trivial (Davidson et al., 2003; Helms & Vinson, 2008; Ottonetti et al., 2008). For entomologists who work in managed systems, questions of omnivory are taking centre stage in research on agents of biological control. The compatibility of multiple control agents, interactions between native and introduced predators, damage to crops and the spread of crop pathogens are all influenced by the degree to which insects practice omnivory. We have always worried, to some degree, about nontarget effects of biological control agents, but concerns most often were for species at the same trophic level as the target of our control efforts (Simberloff & Stiling, 1996; Hawkins & Marino, 1997; Louda & Stiling, 2004; Stiling, 2004). More and more, we recognize that nontarget effects of biological control agents can emerge at multiple trophic levels (Rosenheim et al., 1995; Rosenheim, 1998) with the potential to compromise control efforts and influence associated ecosystems. High rates of omnivory may be responsible in part for the spread of exotic invasive predators and the decline of their native counterparts (Snyder et al., 2004b), with successful invaders being those species with adaptations to counter the ravages of omnivorous predators (Sato & Dixon, 2004). I have been thinking about this recently, in part because of the loss of our friend, colleague, and champion of omnivory research, Robert F. (Bob) Denno, who died last year. Others are more qualified to describe the profound and lasting influence that Bob had on the field of entomology. One of his interests in recent years was the study of omnivory, and his group helped to stimulate cutting-edge research on omnivores in natural and managed systems. This paper is not a tribute to Bob's research. Rather, his passing prompted me to think about the advances in omnivore research made during the last 5 years or so (I cheat with reference to a few important papers of finer vintage), and I present some highlights here with particular reference to managed systems. Omnivores are organisms that feed on more than one trophic level (Pimm & Lawton, 1978). Omnivores therefore include 'herbivores' that engage in cannibalism, 'predators' that suck plant juices or consume seeds or pollen and 'predators' that feed on other predators as well as herbivores (Coll & Guershon, 2002; Denno & Fagan, 2003). Most of us are familiar with ants as prototypical omnivores. Many ant species will consume animal tissue, plant exudates, phloem, seeds (or their elaiosomes) and honeydew produced by herbivorous insects (Carroll & Janzen, 1973). At least for some ant species, omnivory is not simply a response to low resource availability. For example, colonies of the invasive red imported fire ant Solenopsis invicta in the southern U.S.A. grow 50% larger in the presence of honeydew-producing insects than they do when provided with unlimited access to insect prey (Helms & Vinson, 2008). Given that honeydew is generally thought to be a lower-quality resource than animal tissue (Speight et al., 2008), there must be something about resource diversity that is important to fire ants. A subset of omnivores, known as intraguild predators (Polis et al., 1989), feed on prey items and the prey of their prey (Fig. 1). As a result, intraguild (IG) predators both eat IG prey and compete with them for resources. Intraguild predation (IGP) appears to be astonishingly common in nature, with 58–87% of species engaged in IGP interactions in the 113 food webs analysed by Arim and Marquet (2004). This is a staggering proportion of species, and a clear challenge to the notion of discrete trophic levels. According to a wide variety of models of intraguild predation (IGP), coexistence (stability) is possible only when the IG prey is a stronger competitor than the IG predator for the shared resource and only at intermediate levels of resource productivity (Holt & Polis, 1997; Borer et al., 2007). At low resource productivity, the IG predator is excluded, whereas, at high resource productivity, the IG prey is excluded. Given the apparent prevalence of IGP in nature over wide ranges of resource productivity, there must be additional coexistence mechanisms that act to stabilize IGP interactions. These might include cannibalism among predators (Rudolf, 2007), spatial or temporal refuges for the participants (Amarasekare, 2007; Janssen et al., 2007), additional density-dependent processes operating on species (Ives et al., 2005) or additional prey available to the consumers (Briggs & Borer, 2005; Holt & Huxel, 2007). A simple illustration of intraguild predation where the intraguild predator consumes the intraguild prey when competing with it for the crop pest. Pest suppression can be compromised, thus reducing crop yields. If all of the above sounds a bit abstract, consider an example. The harlequin bug Murgantia histrionica is a specialist herbivore on bladderpod Isomeris arborea in California. The eggs of the harlequin bug are parasitized by two specialist parasitoids, Trissolcus murgantiae and Ooencyrtus johnsonii (Amarasekare, 2000). Because they overlap in resource use (harlequin bug eggs) and because O. johnsonii consumes T. murgantiae (but not vice versa) when they co-occur, the system is an example of IGP; O. johnsonii is the IG predator and T. murgantiae is the IG prey. All species coexist over a broad range of resource productivity (i.e. new bug eggs per unit time) and, in this case, the interaction is apparently stabilized by a temporal refuge for the IG prey. Trissolcus murgantiae is active at cooler temperatures and has an early-season time window during which it is free from competition with, and predation by, O. johnsonii (Amarasekare, 2007). I mentioned earlier that omnivory is apparently much more common than we once thought. Why should omnivory be common in nature? Omnivores are an interesting form of dietary generalists, extending their dietary breadth beyond their own trophic level to encompass prey items at additional trophic levels. A generalist diet is considered by some to evolve in response to a trade-off between dietary quality and dietary quantity, and this same logic has been applied to the evolution of insect omnivores (Denno & Fagan, 2003). For example, if the highest-quality food source for an organism is also the most abundant, there should be no selection pressure (or ecological benefit) for a generalist diet and specialization should result (Krebs & Davies, 1993). As described in some ancient religious texts, there are no omnivores in a world awash in manna. However, as the highest-quality food source becomes increasingly diluted by more common, lower quality food, dietary breadth should increase. Denno and Fagan (2003) have suggested that omnivorous predators are supplementing their diet of low-nitrogen herbivores with higher-nitrogen predators. Omnivory, then, is seen as a strategy by which herbivore-eaters improve their lot. A complementary view might be that higher-order predators are required to incorporate lower quality herbivores into their diet because other predators are too rare as sources of food. In other words, the relative scarcity of prey with high concentrations of nitrogen in their body tissues (i.e. other arthropod predators) should result in the incorporation of herbivores (intermediate nitrogen concentrations) and plants (low nitrogen concentrations) into the diet of some predators. Omnivory is therefore favoured by the relative scarcity of food items that are good stoichiometric matches to the consumer. Of course, the evolution of omnivory is not just about stoichiometry (Matsumura et al., 2004). Diet mixing in general can dilute toxins in food, reduce the risk of predation or parasitism, and increase resistance to natural enemies (Singer & Bernays, 2003). There are evolutionary challenges to omnivory because omnivores must be able to catch, handle, digest and assimilate a broader range of prey types than their trophically-conservative relatives. We might therefore expect to see phylogenetic patterns in the evolution of omnivory and, indeed, we do. For example, within ancestrally herbivorous and ancestrally predaceous lineages of terrestrial heteropterans, seed and pollen feeding and broad host ranges are both correlated with the evolution of omnivory (Eubanks et al., 2003). In other words, existing morphological and physiological traits can pre-adapt certain groups to an omnivorous lifestyle (Coll & Guershon, 2002). Our efforts at biological control are often conceived under the assumption of simple food chains. They reflect our desire to manage trophic cascades (Paine, 1980; Carpenter et al., 1985), whereby the abundance of top predators (agents of control) determines the standing crop of primary producers (our crops of interest) (Hunter & Price, 1992; Hunter, 2001). Omnivory may dampen the effects of trophic cascades (Strong, 1992; McCann et al., 1998; Denno, 2007), reducing herbivore suppression by natural enemies and increasing plant damage (Finke & Denno, 2004, 2005). For those of us engaged in the control and management of insect pests, one question is obviously central: does the presence or introduction of multiple enemy species, including omnivores, increase or decrease pest suppression? In other words, how badly do intraguild predation and omnivory interfere with biological control? Quite often, the introduction of multiple agents of control results in the establishment of only a single dominant control agent (Denoth et al., 2002). However, when multiple control agents are naturally or artificially established, what are the consequences for pest suppression? First, consider simple models of IGP. We established above that IG predators and IG prey can sometimes coexist, through a variety of ecological mechanisms either intrinsic or extrinsic to their interactions. What does ecological theory tell us about the suppression of their shared prey: the pests of our production systems? As a reminder, we have to be careful to distinguish between pest 'production', which broadly describes the addition (birth, immigration) of new pest individuals per unit time, and the standing biomass of pests, which describes their average densities in the cropping system. Pest densities can be low, even if pest production is high, when rates of predation are also high. With that in mind, theory predicts that the IG predator should become relatively more abundant (and the IG prey relatively less abundant) as pest productivity increases (Holt & Polis, 1997). Moreover, pest density should also increase as the IG predator increases in dominance. This is exactly what occurs in the dynamics of the iconic California red scale, Aonidiella aurantii, which is parasitized by Aphytis melanus (IG predator) and Encarsia perniciosi (IG prey). As the productivity (i.e. fecundity) of red scale increases among sites, there is an increase in the relative density of the IG predator, A. melanus, and a corresponding increase in scale standing stock (density) (Borer et al., 2003). What that means for pest managers, of course, is a higher pest density as the IG predator comes to dominate the dynamics. Simply put, simple theory tells us that IGP should reduce the suppression of pests by biological control agents. However, empirical studies provide a greater range of outcomes than predicted by simple theory, and the literature includes examples of negative, neutral and positive interactions among predators that share prey resources. A recent meta-analysis has suggested that prey suppression is more often higher in diverse than in simple predator communities (Cardinale et al., 2006), although issues of omnivory were not examined directly. In a second meta-analysis focused more specifically on omnivory, mutual IGP (when predator species can consume each other) was shown to compromise pest suppression in multi-predator systems, whereas unidirectional IGP (or the absence of IGP) did not (Vance-Chalcraft et al., 2007). In other words, the strength and form of IGP in diverse predator communities appears to determine subsequent effects on pest suppression. As a gentle reminder, meta-analyses are usually aggregates of studies that report both significant positive and negative effects; the negative reports do not cease to be valid in their own right just because they are less common on average than the positive ones. Perhaps the more interesting question is why the effects of multi-predator species on pest suppression appear to be context dependent (Straub & Snyder, 2008). We are making major progress in answering this question, in part because theory on interactions among predator species is being linked to theory on relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem processes (Ives et al., 2005). We have learnt from these efforts that there exist at least four mechanisms by which predator diversity influences pest suppression. These are: (i) sampling (or lottery) effects (the presence or absence of dominant predators); (ii) resource partitioning among predators; (iii) indirect effects caused by intraguild predation; and (iv) non-additive effects among predators (Ives et al., 2005). This is a critical observation because it allows us to reconcile studies in which increasing predator diversity is associated with either higher or lower levels of pest suppression. The relative importance of the four mechanisms described above in a particular production system of interest will probably determine whether high predator diversity increases or decreases crop yield. For example, we might expect that multiple predators with strong additive or synergistic effects will increase pest suppression and increase crop yields, whereas multiple predators engaged in high levels of intraguild predation should decrease pest suppression and crop yield (Rosenheim, 1998; Sih et al., 1998; Snyder & Ives, 2003). The study by Ives et al. (2005) provides a roadmap for future research on the effects of multi-predator species on pest suppression because a series of predictions is made that should be testable in production systems. For example, their analyses suggest that the sampling effect will tend to cause a reduction in pest densities as predator diversity increases, so long as predators vary in their assimilation efficiencies or capture rates. Likewise, resource partitioning by predators among multiple species of prey will also tend to cause reductions in the average pest burden on plants as predator density increases. The latter effect of resource partitioning raises an important point: the predicted effects of predator–predator interactions on pest suppression depend upon the number of pest species within the production system. For example, if there is only one pest in the cropping system, or one that is dramatically more important to yield than all others, then IGP will probably lead to higher levels of crop damage. However, models also show that, in speciose pest communities, the total density of the entire herbivore community should still decline with increasing predator diversity when IGP is operating (Ives et al., 2005). This suggests that crops with diverse pest species may suffer less overall damage with diverse predator populations, even when those predators engage in IGP. In brief, the overall impact of IGP on pest suppression depends in part on the diversity of pests in the cropping system. It appears that any negative impacts of IGP on pest suppression may be weak in comparison to the positive effects of predator diversity in multipest systems. The apparent ubiquity of omnivory and intraguild predation (Arim & Marquet, 2004) has prompted much recent empirical work, aimed at untangling the effects of predator–predator interactions on herbivore suppression. In a series of clever experiments, Finke and Denno (2005) measured independently the effects of predator diversity and intraguild predation on herbivores and plants in a salt marsh ecosystem. They demonstrated that increasing predator diversity had little impact on herbivores and plants unless the predators engaged in intraguild predation. Under those circumstances, herbivore suppression declined and plant biomass was concomitantly reduced. Generalizing, multi-predator species appeared to be detrimental to plants when they engaged in intraguild predation. Yet some notorious IG predators can apparently participate in successful biological control. In experimental studies of pea aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum on alfalfa in the Midwestern U.S.A., suppression of pea aphids is higher (with corresponding higher alfalfa yields) with higher diversity of natural enemies (Cardinale et al., 2003). In this interesting case, the presence of generalist predators (Harmonia axyridis and Nabis sp.) causes declines in the associated cowpea aphid Aphis craccivora with the result that a key parasitoid, Aphidius ervi, focuses its prodigious powers of parasitism on pea aphids. The result is greater (non-additive) suppression of pea aphids than would be predicted from the sum of the effects of each enemy in isolation. Pest suppression occurs despite the fact that both Harmonia and Nabis are well-known omnivores, attacking other predators as well as herbivores (Snyder & Ives, 2003). What I particularly like about this study is that it includes measurements of crop yield, providing compelling evidence that growers should benefit from the presence of a diverse predator community. It also illustrates that positive indirect effects of high predator diversity can overcome simultaneous negative effects of IGP, as suggested by Ives et al. (2005). Similarly, a diverse predator assemblage can result in suppression of aphid pests, and higher crop yields, in collards Brassica oleracea (Snyder et al., 2006). In the U.S.A., collards are attacked by the green peach aphid Myzus persicae and the cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicae. In turn, these aphids are attacked by a diverse predator assemblage, including the predatory bugs Geocoris pallens and Nabis spp., the ladybird beetles Coccinella septempunctata and Hippodamia convergens, and the parasitoid wasp Diaeretiella rapae. All of these predators are actually omnivores, engaging in IGP. As a result, IGP has the potential to interfere with pest suppression and increase levels of crop damage. Nonetheless, any negative effects of IGP on pest suppression are swamped by positive effects of predator complementarity, which keep aphid numbers low and increase collard production (Snyder et al., 2006). Similar results were recently reported for potato (Straub & Snyder, 2008). Glasshouse production systems may also benefit from multi-predator introductions, even in the presence of IGP. In the U.S.A., the aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae is a significant pest of greenhouse-grown roses. It is attacked by the parasitoid Aphelinus asychis, which can also establish in greenhouses. It appears that simultaneous introduction of the parasitoid and the coccinellid beetle H. axyridis has no deleterious impact on aphid suppression by the parasitoid (Snyder et al., 2004a). Rather, control is complementary, despite the fact that the beetle consumes mummified aphids that contain parasitoid pupae (intraguild predation). Biological control is improved in the presence of the beetle because it prefers to consume unparasitized, rather than parasitized, aphids. What actions can pest managers take to reduce the probability that IGP will interfere with pest suppression under multi-predator biological control? One possibility might be to increase the heterogeneity of the cropping system. Evidence is accumulating that high habitat heterogeneity can ameliorate the negative effects of IGP on prey suppression. Structured habitats appear to provide refuges for IG prey from their IG predators, favouring the coexistence of multiple predator species (Finke & Denno, 2006; Janssen et al., 2007). For example, in salt marsh ecosystems, spiders and mirid bugs combine to attack populations of Prokelisia planthoppers on Spartina. In the presence of abundant leaf litter (thatch), predators have refuges from IGP, with the result that plant hopper populations decline and plant biomass increases (Finke & Denno, 2006). In the absence of thatch, IGP prevents the trophic cascade from operating, and planthoppers cause declines in plant biomass. In the same system, habitat heterogeneity can also act to reduce rates of cannibalism among predators, a particularly unpleasant yet widespread form of intraguild predation (Langellotto & Denno, 2006). Although habitat heterogeneity does not always result in short-term pest suppression, (Langellotto & Denno, 2004; Janssen et al., 2007)), long-term persistence of a diverse enemy pool may facilitate long-term suppression of pest populations as environments vary over time. A tentative conclusion from the discussion above might be that omnivorous predators can still promote pest suppression and higher crop yields, at least in systems with multiple pest species and high habitat heterogeneity. However, what if those predators also eat plants? Is there a place for crop-eating predators in biological control? Of course, there is a long evolutionary history of mutualism between plants and predators by which plants provide food or shelter for predators in return for predation services (Speight et al., 2008). We might therefore expect that the benefits to plants of supporting plant-feeding predators should often outweigh the costs. It turns out that many predators and parasitoids will consume plant material and still contribute to pest suppression. Zoophytophagy, the habit of consuming plant and animal tissue, is common in agroecosystems among the Heteroptera, Neuroptera, Thysanoptera, Phytoseiidae (Acarina) and Coccinellidae (Coleoptera) (Robinson et al., 2008). Zoophytophagy can be beneficial to biological control, despite plant damage, if it maintains predator populations during periods of low prey abundance (Coll & Guershon, 2002). However, if the crop plants are chemically treated or genetically transformed, plant-feeding has the potential to reduce predator populations (Moser et al., 2008). Zoophytophagous bugs in the family Heteroptera are notorious omnivores, feeding on both plant tissue and insect prey. Indeed, the availability of suitable plant species for oviposition and feeding may increase Heteropteran performance and their subsequent efficacy as agents of control (Lundgren et al., 2008). Typically, however, plants are assumed to be low-quality resources for zoophytophages, exploited largely when animal prey is at low abundance. For example, Nesidiocoris tenuis (Heteroptera: Miridae) is a zoophytophage on whitefly and tomatoes in greenhouse production systems. The occurrence of plant feeding by N. tenuis increases as its own density increases and decreases as whitefly prey become more abundant (Sanchez, 2008). Rapid decreases in N. tenuis populations after whitefly declines demonstrate that plants are poorer nutrient sources for predators than are whitefly prey. The benefits to omnivorous predators of plant-feeding may vary from simple water uptake in some systems to significant nutrient and energy gain in others (Robinson et al., 2008; Sanchez, 2008). For example, the coccinellid beetle Coleomegilla maculata is an important biological control agent of corn pests in the U.S.A. It feeds on corn pollen during larval and adult stages, with adult pollen consumption exceeding a prodigious 13 mg per beetle (Lundgren et al., 2005). Given such high potential consumption of plant resources by omnivores (Wackers et al., 2008), it should be no surprise that there are commercially available 'nutrient supplements' for use with biological control agents. However, it is important to note that their value in pest suppression is not well established (Wade et al., 2008). Whether there is a net positive or negative effect of zoophytophagy on pest suppression may depend upon environmental conditions, including pest density and the period over which pest dynamics are measured. For example, adult lacewings consume floral resources (nectar, pollen) as well as aphid prey on buckwheat in New Zealand (Robinson et al., 2008). In the presence of buckwheat flowers, lacewings consume fewer aphids each day, with an apparently negative effect of omnivory on pest suppression. However, at lower aphid densities, a propensity for flower-feeding reduces the pre-oviposition period of lacewing adults, increasing their oviposition rates (i.e. a long-term positive effect on pest suppression at the population level). This is a key point: short-term experiments tend to illustrate potential negative impacts of omnivory and IGP on pest suppression that may be more than compensated for by long-term benefits under field conditions (Ives et al., 2005; Robinson et al., 2008). As a final thought on zoophytophagy, plants engineered to express toxins might be expected to have negative impacts upon omnivorous predators, and such effects have been documented over the years subsequent to the deployment of transgenic plants. However, most effects appear to be weak. For example, the coccinellid C. maculata, and the invasive coccinellid Harmonia axyridis will feed on corn leaf tissue, even when aphid prey and water are in abundant supply (Moser et al., 2008). Given that most corn in the U.S.A. is now transformed to express Bt toxins, coccinellids might suffer from feeding on transgenic corn. Rates of larval development in C. maculata appear to decline slightly when fed on Bt corn seedlings, but the effect is not particularly strong (Moser et al., 2008). With some exceptions, then, omnivores still appear to be our friends. They add diversity to the predator pool that is available to suppress the pests of our production systems. Their pathways of consumption may be reticulate and their interactions indirect, but they can often contribute to biological control in important ways. To maximize the benefits and minimize the risks associated with using omnivores in biological control, there are several lines of future work that would be beneficial. I have already mentioned the important predictions provided by the theoretical work of Ives et al. (2005) that need to be tested. Additionally, stable isotope analyses are providing more detailed descriptions of the relative consumption by omnivores of different food sources. For example, in Tuscan olive orchards, 13C signatures demonstrate that ants gain energy from both olive-based and herb-based food webs. In the same system, different ant species vary in their use of plant-based and animal-based resources, as illustrated by their 15N signatures (Ottonetti et al., 2008). Such studies provide vital information on the energy pathways used by omnivores in production systems and appear to support the important role of habitat heterogeneity in mediating the positive impacts of omnivores in pest suppression. Moreover, as Bob Denno would have pointed out, we need to consider in much more detail how the behaviours and life histories of predators and prey influence the strength and direction of interactions in omnivorous food webs (Denno et al., 2003; Rosenheim & Corbett, 2003; Singer & Bernays, 2003). We should also continue to explore effects of omnivory on pest suppression that appear influenced by ecological contingency, particularly variation caused by seasonality, habitat structure and nutrient availability (Gratton & Denno, 2003; Denno et al., 2005). Omnivores may complicate our traditional naïve views of pest management, but there is no denying that they make life more interesting.",https://openalex.org/W2099415115,73b9e1b3df128db3bf9a990037c2dc6ce7093da0,0,True,0.9814813733100891,0

Leaf pubescence has been repeatedly shown to mediate predator‐herbivore interactions whereas the influence of leaf pubescence on predator–predator interactions such as intraguild predation (IGP) has seldom been investigated. Using a three‐pronged approach we assessed the influence of leaf pubescence on the predatory mites Kampimodromus aberrans and Euseius finlandicus. Both predators occur on broad‐leaved trees in Europe. Euseius finlandicus is mostly found on trees with glabrous leaves whereas K. aberrans mainly occurs on trees with pubescent leaves. We hypothesized that leaf pubescence mediates IGP between K. aberrans and E. finlandicus and thereby determines their dominance and proportional abundance. A field survey on apple revealed that the abundance of K. aberrans and E. finlandicus is negatively correlated, with the former predominating on cultivars with strongly pubescent leaves and the latter predominating on cultivars with little pubescent or glabrous leaves. Microhabitat choice tests showed that K. aberrans preferentially resides on pubescent leaves whereas E. finlandicus preferentially resides on glabrous leaves. The effects of leaf pubescence on survival and development of immature IG predators and IG prey were reversed for K. aberrans and E. finlandicus. In the presence of the IG predator E. finlandicus, immature K. aberrans had higher survival probabilities on pubescent leaves than on glabrous ones. In contrast, the survival chances of immature E. finlandicus were higher on glabrous leaves than on pubescent ones when the IG predator K. aberrans was present. Artificial leaf pubescence enhanced IG prey capture by immature K. aberrans and prolonged their longevity but impaired IG prey capture by immature E. finlandicus and shortened their longevity. We conclude that leaf pubescence mediates IGP strength and symmetry and discuss the implications to natural and biological control.",https://openalex.org/W2021103581,cf4e106cc13d3c30d69bb5e1c26fb74c0bad7a04,0,True,0.9901303648948669,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1218,Herbivore density mediates the indirect effect of herbivores on plants via induced resistance and apparent competition,"Abstract Herbivore‐induced plant resistance and apparent competition are two indirect ways herbivores interact. If a less damaging herbivore indirectly suppresses the abundance of a more damaging herbivore via these mechanisms, then plants may ultimately benefit. Changes in herbivore density, however, can dictate the intensity of species interactions and may play a critical role in determining the outcome of plant‐ and predator‐mediated herbivore interactions. We tested the effects of herbivore density on the strength of indirect interactions among phloem‐feeding aphids and herbivorous caterpillars and the outcome of these interactions for their shared host plant, cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum ). We quantified the survival of caterpillars on host plants that were infested with varying densities of aphids in the presence and absence of predators (ladybeetles). We found that aphids induced defensive proteins in cotton plants and that caterpillar survival was negatively affected by induced resistance. Likewise, we found that the presence of aphids increased predation of caterpillars by ladybeetles, but that apparent competition between aphids and caterpillars was density dependent. Ladybeetles consumed relatively high numbers of small caterpillars at low to intermediate aphid densities, but essentially became aphid specialists at high aphid densities. Aphid induced defenses and apparent competition combined such that plant damage by caterpillars was lowest when predators were present at low aphid density (induced resistance + highest level of apparent competition). This suggests that herbivores can benefit plants, but the effect on host plants is mediated by herbivore density. Indirect herbivore‐plant mutualisms may increase plant quality, plant fitness, and yield of crop plants and these interactions need to be considered in ecologically based pest management plans. In addition, these interactions likely alter arthropod community structure and natural selection on anti‐herbivore defense traits in plants in natural systems.",https://openalex.org/W2291488578,fc5312776738c6a1c139b9e0a5aedcdb7cd8f412,0,True,0.9626578688621521,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jzo.12127,Trait‐mediated effects between predators: ant chemical cues induce spider dispersal,"Abstract Predators can induce changes in prey phenotype such as dispersal, activity and foraging rate. Such trait‐mediated effects ( TME s) can strongly affect prey populations and generate trophic cascades, rivaling the importance of predation in communities. However, the relevance of TME on intraguild interactions has rarely been addressed. Ants and spiders are widespread generalist predators in terrestrial habitats. Ants influence arthropod assemblages and disrupt top‐down effects of spiders on herbivores by killing spiders and/or by inducing spider emigration. Here, we examined whether ants induce dispersal behaviour in spiders. We tested the effect of chemical cues of two ant species ( L asius niger, F ormica clara ) on the walking activity and the propensity for silk‐based dispersal of spiders. Silk‐based dispersal of the web‐builder P hylloneta impressa increased by 80% with exposure to L asius cues, whereas dispersal of the hunting spider X ysticus more than doubled when confronted with cues of both L asius and F ormica. In addition, X ysticus individuals showed a marked increase in walking activity when exposed to F ormica but not L asius cues. Our results show for the first time that perceived predation risk influences spider dispersal. The strong effect of ant chemical cues on spider dispersal demonstrates that TME s contribute to the impact of ants on arthropod communities.",https://openalex.org/W1512314749,1ee19c422a4bd1592c82805a7981036d0e6db8f9,0,True,0.9655721783638,0

It focuses on two well documented responses of consumers to predation risk: decrease in consumer activity and habitat switch. These behavioral effects are transmitted to resources and they cause similar indirect effects as those which are mediated by density changes in consumers. Two indirect interactions are studied in this article: trophic cascades, and apparent competition. Results for density only, trait only and combined density and trait mediated interactions are compared and discussed with respect to manipulation with predator density (top‐down manipulation) and resource environmental capacity (bottom‐up manipulation). The article shows that trait‐mediated effects on species equilibrial densities are similar to those of density‐mediated, but they are often highly non‐linear. Thus, they may have potential for even stronger impact on food webs than those which are density mediated.",https://openalex.org/W2107288913,a242ffefff4e1430ad413b48da6fac5f849b36c5,0,True,0.9639219641685486,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12317,Density‐ and trait‐mediated effects of a parasite and a predator in a tri‐trophic food web,"Summary Despite growing interest in ecological consequences of parasitism in food webs, relatively little is known about effects of parasites on long‐term population dynamics of non‐host species or about whether such effects are density or trait mediated. We studied a tri‐trophic food chain comprised of (i) a bacterial basal resource ( S erratia fonticola ), (ii) an intermediate consumer ( P aramecium caudatum ), (iii) a top predator ( D idinium nasutum ) and (iv) a parasite of the intermediate consumer ( H olospora undulata ). A fully factorial experimental manipulation of predator and parasite presence/absence was combined with analyses of population dynamics, modelling and analyses of host ( P aramecium ) morphology and behaviour. Predation and parasitism each reduced the abundance of the intermediate consumer ( P aramecium ), and parasitism indirectly reduced the abundance of the basal resource ( S erratia ). However, in combination, predation and parasitism had non‐additive effects on the abundance of the intermediate consumer, as well as on that of the basal resource. In both cases, the negative effect of parasitism seemed to be effaced by predation. Infection of the intermediate consumer reduced predator abundance. Modelling and additional experimentation revealed that this was most likely due to parasite reduction of intermediate host abundance (a density‐mediated effect), as opposed to changes in predator functional or numerical response. Parasitism altered morphological and behavioural traits, by reducing host cell length and increasing the swimming speed of cells with moderate parasite loads. Additional tests showed no significant difference in D idinium feeding rate on infected and uninfected hosts, suggesting that the combination of these modifications does not affect host vulnerability to predation. However, estimated rates of encounter with S erratia based on these modifications were higher for infected Paramecium than for uninfected P aramecium. A mixture of density‐mediated and trait‐mediated indirect effects of parasitism on non‐host species creates rich and complex possibilities for effects of parasites in food webs that should be included in assessments of possible impacts of parasite eradication or introduction.",https://openalex.org/W2054928994,5c6d1a1d095cbc0df8bce3c5aaa3d6fb6f55be56,0,True,0.985050618648529,0

Parasitic phorid flies limit competitive-dominant ant activity, potentially meditating competitive interactions between ant species, changing competitive hierarchies, or affecting ant communities. I considered interactions between phorids (Pseudacteon sp.), their ant host (Azteca instabilis F. Smith), and co-occurring ant species in coffee agro-ecosystems testing whether phorids (1) limit A. instabilis recruitment activity, (2) affect competitive interaction between ant species, and (3) are associated with other species' resource access and therefore have the potential to change competitive hierarchies. I monitored recruitment of A. instabilis and other ants to baits over 90 min on canopy trees with or without phorids. A. instabilis were one-half as abundant with phorids. Other species gained access to baits 12 times more often and were only able to take over baits when phorids were present. Furthermore, many more species (13 versus 2) gained access to resources when phorids were present. These results indicate that phorids mediate competitive interactions between ant species and may influence ant communities by affecting resource availability. Considering that phorids limit A. instabilis attacks on herbivores and that ant species differ in effects on arthropod communities, phorids may have strong community-level effects in coffee agro-ecosystems.",https://openalex.org/W2173084741,21944f1ac4f3e00ed7f14759728a49e61e5f32bb,0,True,0.9862258434295654,0
https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/380474,Trait-Mediated Indirect Effects of Phorid Flies on Ants,"This paper provides a synthesis of the ecological impact of phorid fly parasitoids on ants. We find the most important impact of phorids on ants to be trait-mediated effects. Phorids diminish the foraging activity of ants, frequently reducing the number and average size of foragers and reducing the amount of food retrieved by a colony. However, ants' coping mechanisms include changing foraging site and time. Phorids can also affect competition, especially through changes in the ability of the host to win in exploitative competition. Factors such as microclimate, resource size, and habitat complexity interact with phorids to change their effect on competition. By being highly specific and attacking ants high in the competitive hierarchy, phorids can alter the linear nature of the competitive transitivity, and by reducing the number of foragers, they can change the discovery-dominance tradeoff that is observed in some ant communities. Trait-mediated effects of phorids also cascade to other trophic levels. As an example, we discuss the trait-mediated cascade of phorids on the Azteca instabilis system in coffee. In this system, by reducing the foraging activity of A. instabilis, phorids reduce the direct and indirect biological control impact of the ant in the coffee agroecosystem.",https://openalex.org/W2008344466,a67bc022df2bfd4acfe3d3cb121fdec4a7e44373,0,True,0.9902246594429016,0
https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2016.2590,Moving beyond linear food chains: trait-mediated indirect interactions in a rocky intertidal food web,"In simple, linear food chains, top predators can have positive indirect effects on basal resources by causing changes in the traits (e.g. behaviour, feeding rates) of intermediate consumers. Although less is known about trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) in more complex food webs, it has been suggested that such complexity dampens trophic cascades. We examined TMIIs between a predatory crab ( Carcinus maenas ) and two ecologically important basal resources, fucoid algae ( Ascophyllum nodosum ) and barnacles ( Semibalanus balanoides ), which are consumed by herbivorous ( Littorina littorea ) and carnivorous ( Nucella lapillus ) snails, respectively. Because crab predation risk suppresses snail feeding rates, we hypothesized that crabs would also shape direct and indirect interactions among the multiple consumers and resources. We found that the magnitude of TMIIs between the crab and each resource depended on the suite of intermediate consumers present in the food web. Carnivorous snails ( Nucella ) transmitted TMIIs between crabs and barnacles. However, crab–algae TMIIs were transmitted by both herbivorous ( Littorina ) and carnivorous ( Nucella ) snails, and these TMIIs were additive. By causing Nucella to consume fewer barnacles, crab predation risk allowed fucoids that had settled on or between barnacles to remain in the community. Hence, positive interactions between barnacles and algae caused crab–algae TMIIs to be strongest when both consumers were present. Studies of TMIIs in more realistic, reticulate food webs will be necessary for a more complete understanding of how predation risk shapes community dynamics.",https://openalex.org/W2603614123,a593f7ecabd9910d099cf665499987b859a17aaf,0,True,0.9825029373168945,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12413,Using plant functional traits to restore Hawaiian rainforest,"Ecosystem restoration efforts are carried out by a variety of individuals and organizations with an equally varied set of goals, priorities, resources and time-scales. Once restoration of a degraded landscape or community is recognized as necessary, choosing which species to include in a restoration programme can be a difficult and value-laden process (Fry, Power & Manning 2013; Jones 2013). Species choice in restoration is often carried out with limited ecological information, particularly in regard to species interactions, successional processes and resource-use patterns. Selecting species can be particularly problematic in systems where there is no available baseline data on historical communities, or when restoration to a historic state is not feasible for ecological, logistic or economic reasons. In such cases, it may be preferable to focus on restoring site 'functionality' rather than returning to a historic baseline composition. We present a method for species selection in restoration, based on the collection of plant functional trait data. Using this method, managers can develop species mixtures with desired properties, including expected predictions of interspecific interactions and potential changes in biotic and abiotic conditions. To illustrate this approach, we present a case study in Hawaiian lowland wet forests (HLWF) in which plant species for a restoration project were chosen based on their functional traits, in order to help land managers achieve their restoration goals while at the same time allowing researchers to better understand invasion resistance and ecosystem functioning. In our case, our choices led to the development of hybrid ecosystems including both native and introduced species. However, the approach that we present is not limited to novel or hybrid ecosystem creation, because the candidate species examined and functional traits measured are determined by the user. Whereas restoration usually implies a return to historic conditions, there is also growing attention to what some authors have called 'intervention ecology' (sensu Hobbs et al. 2011). This view emphasizes maintaining ecosystem services and functions (Hobbs et al. 2011). The contrast between these frameworks has been widely debated in the literature, and we do not intend to advocate the merit of one view over the other here. Rather, we present the logic behind a functional trait approach, describe why its use is feasible in a Hawaiian lowland forest and present a step-by-step approach to the method that can be applied to a wide variety of ecological systems. While we readily acknowledge that in our study system, we cannot return to a pre-human state, we still consider our approach 'restoration' in a broad sense. Functional trait theory holds that characteristics or traits of each species reflect their resource use and life-history trade-offs (Reich 2014). A body of evidence shows that plant traits vary continuously, in predictable ways, along resource availability gradients – suggesting that species' functional traits can be linked to ecosystem properties and to ecosystem services (Lavorel 2013). Many studies have suggested that a robust image of a species' functional profile can be obtained by considering traits related to resource acquisition (e.g. foliar nitrogen, leaf area), resource limitation (e.g. midday leaf water potential, δ13C-integrated water-use efficiency, leaf mass per area), reproductive investment (e.g. height, seed mass, dispersal type) and resource allocation patterns (e.g. leaf mass per area, specific root length, wood density) (Drenovsky & James 2010; Douma et al. 2012; Sonnier et al. 2012; Fry, Power & Manning 2013). For restoration, selecting species with certain functional trait values can influence species interactions (including competition) and ecosystem properties (Suding et al. 2008). For example, if creating a more fire-tolerant community is necessary, practitioners could select species that increase fine-fuel loads or species whose presence will favour succession from forest to grassland. Other considerations relevant to managers include importance to local wildlife, ability to serve as nurse logs, nitrogen-fixing properties, etc. The Hawaiian archipelago offers a unique setting for testing novel approaches to applied ecological questions. On one hand, Hawai'i is considered a model system for ecological research because of the combination of well-defined biotic and abiotic gradients with extreme examples of adaptive radiation (Vitousek 2004). On the other hand, like many isolated oceanic islands, the Hawaiian Islands have been extremely vulnerable to invasion and anthropogenic disturbance. The combination of simplicity and susceptibility presents a distinctive platform for conservation research. Hawaiian lowland wet forests in particular present serious challenges for restoration and conservation. This forest type only exists as remnant patches, is always populated by invasive plant and animal species, and occurs near human habitation, where non-native propagule pressure is likely to be high (Zimmerman et al. 2008). In such ecosystems, it is important to recognize that not all non-native species are equally problematic. For example, many Polynesian introductions in Hawai'i have persisted in the landscape for up to 1000 years without becoming invasive. In addition to being culturally important, many non-invasive, non-native species have functional trait values, which are not present in the native flora. Breadfruit and coconut are two species that fit both of these criteria: they are not classified as invasive, and they have large leaves and seeds, unlike most native plants. From a restoration perspective, we aimed to test the hypothesis that designing communities with greater diversity of functional trait expression will lead to more invasion-resistant communities (Funk et al. 2008; Drenovsky & James 2010). To do so, we examined the functional traits of species using multivariate analysis; the technique projects each species to a specific x,y location in 'trait space,' which should reflect that species' functional profile. Our restoration experiment was carried out at the Keaukaha Military Reservation (KMR) within the municipality of Hilo. This site retains a HLWF, which has a canopy that contains significant numbers of native tree species; however, it also has a long history of disturbance, and invasive trees represent up to half of the basal area (Ostertag et al. 2009). A previous removal experiment in this forest has shown that removal of invasive species alone is not enough to get a native forest back, despite its positive influence on seedling recruitment of native species (Cordell et al. 2009; Ostertag et al. 2009). Given current conditions, the forest is poised to lose most of its native species and become like most of the forest patches remaining in the lowlands – almost exclusively non-native dominated. The trait-based method we used employs five steps. We illustrate the method's use in HLWF; however, it need not include the use of non-native species, and it is exportable to other ecosystems. Land managers at KMR are charged with specific targets developed by the US military. These are as follows: (i) conserving and encouraging the regeneration of native biodiversity at the site, (ii) controlling invasive species and (iii) encouraging carbon storage on the landscape. Because restoring this area to an all-native ecosystem is no longer economically feasible, we elected to create hybrid ecosystems. Our experimental communities were assembled using species whose combined functional trait profiles addressed these three management goals to meet restoration objectives of the main stakeholders. We had two main considerations for choosing the traits on which to base our species selection. First, we wanted to estimate the 'functional role' or 'strategy' (sensu Reich 2014) of different species within HLWF environments, and secondly, we wanted to identify specific traits that would address our restoration objectives. We first looked at the overall distribution of HLWF species in trait space and then focused on how different species expressed particular traits that were relevant to our restoration objectives. The functional traits measured (Table 1) were derived from literature and field data. We included traits that are informative in the ecological context of HLWF. For example, knowing that light (rather than nutrient or water availability) is the primary limiting resource for native species in this forest (Ostertag et al. 2009), we included a suite of traits related to light capture (as well as canopy and understorey architecture; including leaf : petiole ratio, plant height and canopy shape). Many of the traits we measured are informative of more than one aspect of a plant species' ecological strategy, and some traits can be used as proxies for others, which are more difficult to measure. For example, we included both maximum plant height and seed mass as proxies for dispersal distance (see Thomson et al. 2011). The potential species pool included native species thought to have been present at the site historically, native species currently found at the site and non-native species already found in the region that are believed to pose low invasion risk. To address the latter, we based our decisions on the Hawaiian Weed Risk Assessment score (Daehler et al. 2004; see In a past study at KMR, woody species richness was nine native species and 10 introduced species (Zimmerman et al. 2008). Due to a lack of formal records of species occurrence and poor pollen preservation, it is difficult to ascertain which species would have been found historically in any given area of HLWF. Because we suspect that some native species once found at KMR have been locally extirpated, we cast a wide net in order to determine which species could potentially be used for restoring the forest. We included native species with similar environmental requirements that could have occurred in HLWF, based on historical range descriptions by Wagner, Herbst & Sohmer (1999) and previous field experience. Once the list of potential species was compiled (including 17 non-native and 19 native species), we eliminated species which were too difficult to sample or propagate, and species for which sufficient data were not available – reducing our pool to 16 native species and 15 non-native species. Other limiting factors that practitioners should consider include economics (e.g. cost of seeds, plants, labour or time), logistics (e.g. availability of species, project or budget timelines), resilience to climatic change or disturbance regimes, as well as the goals and expectations of stakeholders. We sampled plant traits across the full range of conditions in which HLWF is found regionally in order to account for both site and environmental heterogeneity. In total, we sampled traits at 25 sites throughout east Hawai'i Island, in addition to using existing data from the literature. By far, the most time-consuming and effort-consuming steps in making species choices by using traits are creating the potential species pool and collecting trait data. However, compilations of trait data are increasingly common world-wide. A variety of data sets are available either directly from researchers and agencies involved in the region (e.g. the Australian Virtual Herbarium) or from collaborative data base compilations (e.g. TRY ( DRYAD ( or LEDA ( Once the trait data were assembled, we grouped the information for each trait into quartiles in order to account for both analytical constraints and the nature of trait data. Because we considered both multiple traits and multiple species, making meaningful comparisons was often challenging. For example, measures of seed mass spanned many orders of magnitude from <0·001 to 576 g, while the maximum difference in leaf thickness measured no more than 0·4 mm (Table 1). Furthermore, sometimes it is necessary to compare ratios and categories to numerical data. The use of quartiles places more importance on the relative differences in trait values. This approach emphasizes species which are 'outliers' rather than species that display the 'middle range' (i.e. the most or least effective water use vs. the species whose values are nearest to the group mean). This type of data manipulation is appropriate to the multivariate ordination analysis we later employ. We used a principal components analysis (PCA) to show how the selected species are arranged, relative to one another, in trait space and to provide an idea of each species' functional profile. Other multivariate techniques could be substituted. An important outcome of the PCA was the prominent separation of native and non-native species in distinct areas of the graph, primarily based on leaf mass per area, carbon : nitrogen ratio and foliar nitrogen (Fig. 1a). This result reinforces that species in Hawai'i with different biogeographic origins are functionally divergent. Hawaiian species tend to be conservative in regard to growth and nutrient acquisition, whereas the non-native species tend towards faster life-history strategies. Carbon turnover rates are substantially higher in invasive-dominated communities than they are in native plant communities (Hughes et al. 2014). With this in mind, we ran an additional PCA using only traits associated with carbon cycling (including specific gravity, foliar chemistry and maximum plant height) to find which species from our pool have the greatest likelihood of slow rates of carbon turnover (Fig. 1b). We identified two groups of four 'core species' whose trait profiles indicate either slow or moderate carbon turnover, and then located these core species on the first (general) PCA of all species traits (Fig. 1a). Based on Euclidian distances within the general PCA, we determined a centroid point equidistant from all four species in each group and then selected groups of additional species that were closer (i.e. most similar and potentially most redundant) and furthest (i.e. least similar and potentially most complementary) to each centroid (Fig. 1c). The motivation for this selection was that we are trying to determine whether combinations of species whose traits are more dissimilar (complementary) or similar (redundant) confer greater invasion resistance in the hybrid forests (Funk et al. 2008). Once species are displayed in trait space, a variety of decisions can be made based on their relative functional profiles. While our process included two PCAs, for some restoration objectives, decisions could be made with only one (Fig. 1a). In our case, pragmatic and logistical concerns were addressed at this point. For example, one of our species was removed, because although it was culturally important, and functionally a good fit, it is unable to maintain itself without direct, ongoing human intervention. Alternatively, when several species proved to be functionally similar, final species choice was based on pragmatic considerations such as seedling cost, availability within given time frames or projected time to maturity. In short, the process allows for an unbiased way to let the data dictate a first step, and then, the practical concerns of practitioners can be layered onto the final species choices. To date, multiple studies have evaluated the role of functional traits in ecosystems and/or been carried out in controlled settings and relatively simple ecosystems such as grasslands (Drenovsky & James 2010; Fry, Power & Manning 2013; Lavorel 2013). We show that a trait-based approach can also be used in a tropical forest system. Because the metrics are based on site-specific restoration objectives, this approach is generalizable, flexible and transferable across ecosystems and taxa. Once refined, the approach can be applied with relatively little effort by managers. We named our project Liko Nā Pilina, which translates loosely to 'the budding new relationships', to emphasize the developing associations among the species, and the intertwining of fundamental science questions and the practical needs of land managers faced with a formidable task made more daunting by lack of information on how to achieve their restoration goals. While it is too early to determine if the treatments met our objectives, results 1 year after planting show >90% survival of outplants and increased seedling recruitment by native species. By creating hybrid ecosystems using both native and non-native species (many of which are culturally significant), the project melds together traditional and contemporary approaches to forest management. This has proved attractive to the general public, school groups and summer programmes, allowing us to tap into an eager set of volunteers. In our experience, the level of community engagement is unusual for science-based restoration experiments. Thus, this new type of restoration can fulfil many goals, providing a rigorous way to choose species for restoration as well as providing a simple framework that is appealing to local communities.

The present article investigates beyond the pairwise competitive interactions and provides a novel perspective for understanding the influence of higher-order interactions on the evolution of social phenotypes. Our simple model yields a prosperous outlook to demonstrate the impact of perturbations on intransitive competitive higher-order interactions. Using a mathematical technique, we show how alone the perturbed interaction network can quickly determine the coexistence equilibrium of competing species instead of solving a large system of ordinary differential equations. It is possible to split the system into multiple feasible cluster states depending on the number of perturbations. Our analysis also reveals that the ratio between the unperturbed and perturbed species is inversely proportional to the amount of employed perturbation. Our results suggest that nonlinear dynamical systems and interaction topologies can be interplayed to comprehend species' coexistence under adverse conditions. Particularly, our findings signify that less competition between two species increases their abundance and outperforms others.",https://openalex.org/W4307414406,c6d1c81636cf479c7c6c4c026062cfc9a4303fd7,0,True,0.9738852381706238,0
https://doi.org/10.1086/700314,"Herkogamy, a Principal Functional Trait of Plant Reproductive Biology","Premise of research. Phenotypic traits that consistently mediate species' responses to environmental variation (functional traits) provide a promising approach toward generalizing ecological and evolutionary patterns and thereby gaining insights into the processes generating them. In the plant functional ecology literature, most trait-based studies have focused on traits mediating either resource competition or responses to variation in the abiotic environment, while traits mediating reproductive interactions have often been neglected.Methodology. Here, I discuss the value of herkogamy, the spatial separation of male and female functions in flowers, as a functional trait in plant reproductive biology and review the evidence relevant to the hypothesis that taxa exhibiting greater herkogamy have historically experienced more reliable pollination and more outcrossed mating systems.Pivotal results. A large body of work in the field of plant reproductive biology has identified a set of nearly ubiquitous correlations between average herkogamy and features of plant mating systems, notably, autofertility (seed set in the absence of pollinators) and outcrossing rate. Herkogamy often varies extensively among populations and species, and the adaptive interpretation is that herkogamy exhibits local adaptation to the reliability of the pollination environment.Conclusions. These results underline the value of herkogamy as a functional trait representing variation in mating histories. Many important insights are likely to emerge from studies leveraging herkogamy as an easily measured proxy of plant mating systems, as already demonstrated in comparative studies and studies of reproductive interactions. Greater consideration of herkogamy and other reproductive-function traits in studies of species coexistence may provide a more complete understanding of community assembly processes.",https://openalex.org/W2896731564,d93fecf00af5b249778476e7d6fdbfc87bf4d604,0,True,0.9781064391136169,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13039,Functional traits in agroecology: Advancing description and prediction in agroecosystems,"Agricultural expansion and intensification are contributing to the world's most pressing environmental issues including global climatic change, widespread depletion and contamination of soil and water resources, major disruptions in the Earth's biogeochemical cycles and rates of species extinctions that are conspicuous on geological time-scales (Burney, Davis, & Lobell, 2010; Foley et al., 2005, 2011; Vitousek et al., 1997). Additionally, dominant models of agricultural production—largely envisioned as intensively managed monocultures—have resulted in widespread financial indebtedness of farmers, declining farmer autonomy in management decision-making, and the loss of crop genetic resources (Olson, Morris, & Mendez, 2012; Tomich et al., 2011). Paradoxically as well, while intensive industrial agriculture has increased food production rates to levels that are unprecedented in human history, they have ultimately resulted in pervasive reductions in global food security and sovereignty (Altieri & Toledo, 2011) to the extent that issues of food production, distribution and nutrition occupy a central role in the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs; Pérez-Escamilla, 2017). Agroecology as a scientific discipline, an on-farm practice, and a social or political movement is gaining momentum as a contemporary lens to critique, evaluate and manage the myriad of global socio-economic and environmental issues surrounding food production (Mendez, Bacon, & Cohen, 2013). As a biophysical science, agroecology merges ecology, global change science, plant biology and soil science in order to address many of the most pressing issues of our time including food security, biodiversity loss and climate change (Altieri, 1999; Altieri, Nicholls, Henao, & Lana, 2015; Lin, 2011; Tomich et al., 2011; Tscharntke et al., 2012). But while agroecology is well positioned to address many of these pressing global issues, the science of agroecology lacks a theoretical framework that allows for the development and testing of generalizable hypotheses; especially those that are broadly relevant for farm-scale agricultural management, regional-level land-use planning or international environmental policy. Agroecological research based on a plant functional trait approach may provide such a generalizable framework. In the late 1970s through the 1990s, ecologists began to argue that differences in ecological strategies among plants represent the basis for explaining and predicting individual-, species- and ecosystem-level responses to environmental change (Bazzaz, 1979; Bazzaz & Carlson, 1982; Givnish, 1988; Grime, 1977, 1979, 1988; Lambers & Poorter, 1992; Reich, Walters, & Ellsworth, 1992; Westoby, 1998; Westoby, Falster, Moles, Vesk, & Wright, 2002). While such studies took a number of different approaches—e.g. the ""competition, stress, disturbance"" (CSR) theory (Grime, 1977, 1988), or ""early-, mid- and late-successional species"" classification schemes (e.g. Bazzaz, 1979)—such studies were broadly similar in that they focused on identifying a small number of functional types that could be used to categorize the ecological differences among a large number of plant species. In the 2000s, plant ecologists began to refine these ideas, by evaluating the ecologically meaningful characteristics of plants and plant parts—or the functional traits—which both (1) quantitatively differentiate species from one another along axes of ecological differences and/or functional biology (Reich et al., 1999; Westoby, 1998; Westoby et al., 2002; Wright et al., 2004, 2005), and (2) are most important in mechanistically predicting plant responses to, and impacts on, surrounding environments (Lavorel & Garnier, 2002). Thanks in part to the immense amount of species' trait data that emerged in the early 2000s (e.g. Wright et al., 2004), which has since been consolidated into massive trait databases (e.g. Kattge et al., 2011), studies differentiating trait-based ecological strategies have now come to encapsulate thousands of plant species (Diaz et al., 2016), and a global understanding of relationships between ecosystem processes and plant functional biology is being defined and refined (Diaz et al., 2004). On the basis of this rich history of theoretical and empirical research, over the past 30 years, trait-based ecology has emerged as one of the dominant paradigms in terrestrial ecology, and the theory and principles of trait-based ecology are now widely used to evaluate a remarkable range of questions and hypotheses in global change biology (e.g. Garnier, Navas, & Grigulis, 2016). From an applied perspective, trait-based ecology has more recently been embraced as a critical means by which scientists can test hypotheses on, and recommend management of, managed terrestrial ecosystems (e.g. Cadotte, 2011 and references therein). The transition of trait-based ecology into resource management fields was facilitated by clear empirical evidence that plant functional traits, and functional trait diversity are strong mechanistic predictors of ecosystem functioning (Cadotte, Cavender-Bares, Tilman, & Oakley, 2009; reviewed by Garnier et al., 2016). Scientists are now adopting trait-based approaches to research in many applied fields including restoration ecology (e.g. Funk, Cleland, Suding, & Zavaleta, 2008; Laughlin, 2014), urban ecology (Duncan et al., 2011) and more recently, agroecology (Garnier & Navas, 2012; Martin & Isaac, 2015; Milla, Osborne, Turcotte, & Violle, 2015; Wood et al., 2015). Opinions that trait-based ecology might be efficacious in addressing major questions in agricultural systems first emerged over 5 years ago in a review by Garnier and Navas (2012) that summarized the concepts, tools and applications of functional ecology within agroecology. Then in 2015, three review papers published near-simultaneously (Martin & Isaac, 2015; Milla et al., 2015; Wood et al., 2015) summarized in greater detail the types of broad agroecological questions, hypotheses and management decisions that might be informed by trait-based research. Specifically, these papers reviewed how trait-based ecology could address questions and hypotheses surrounding the ecological consequences of crop breeding (Milla, Morente-Lopez, Alonso-Rodrigo, Martin-Robles, & Chapin, 2014; Milla et al., 2015); how functional traits underpin crop yield and yield models (Gagliardi, Martin, Virginio, Rapidel, & Isaac, 2015); how functional traits influence agricultural nutrient cycling (Garcia-Palacios et al., 2013); and how functional diversity inform an understanding of agricultural contributions to global net primary productivity (Monfreda, Ramankutty, & Foley, 2008). But while these and other examples were drawn from the literature, these review papers (Martin & Isaac, 2015; Milla et al., 2015; Wood et al., 2015) also highlighted the lack of research employing trait-based approaches to test hypotheses on linkages between on-farm diversity and agroecosystem functioning. This lack of research requires some qualification. Plant breeders, crop biologists, agronomists, ecophysiologists and farmers have certainly allocated considerable attention to understanding and selecting for crops that express certain reproductive, leaf, root, phenological and chemical traits (e.g. Meister, Rajani, Ruzicka, & Schachtman, 2014; Meyer, DuVal, & Jensen, 2012). However, this vast amount of scientific and informal on-farm research tends to focus on understanding and managing linkages between only certain functional traits—those forming part of a crop domestication syndrome (Meyer et al., 2012)—and yield. In comparison, trait-based agroecology as envisioned by applied ecologists (Garnier & Navas, 2012; Martin & Isaac, 2015; Milla et al., 2015; Wood et al., 2015), and expanded upon by the research in this Special Feature, seeks to understand how knowledge of the variation in the functional traits and trait diversity of both crop and non-crop species can be used to predict, manage and enhance multiple critical ecosystems functions other than yield alone. Discussing the value and potential application of trait-based agroecology must deal with issues of yield to some degree, as it is the key ecosystem service upon which many livelihoods are predicated. But this Special Feature has a broader goal, in seeking to significantly advance a trait-based understanding of how a wider range of above- and below-ground agroecosystem functions are linked to functional trait diversity among and within both crop and non-crop species. This Special Feature includes seven studies that employ functional trait-based approaches, to frame, test and interpret management-relevant hypotheses in agroecosystems. In doing so, cumulatively these studies provide arguably the single largest empirical and conceptual contribution to a trait-based understanding of agroecological structure and function. Specifically, these studies provide novel insights and evaluations into a wide range of agroecological questions, including how functional trait diversity is driving agricultural nutrient cycles and below-ground processes (Blesh, 2017; Pommier et al., 2017); how knowledge of functional traits can inform the restoration of degraded agricultural land (Lohbeck, Winowiecki, Aynekulu, Okia, & Vågen, 2017); how functional traits can be used to infer the ecological consequences of crop domestication (Roucou et al., 2017); how functional diversity-based approaches can be used to assess nutritional diversity in agricultural systems (Wood, 2017); and lastly, how farmers value, and make management decisions based on, functional traits of crop and non-crop species (Damour, Navas, & Garnier, 2017; Isaac et al., 2017). In this Special Feature, Damour et al. (2017) make a major conceptual contribution to a broader understanding of the potential applications of trait-based agroecology, though a revised ""response/effect"" framework that aids researchers in hypothesizing linkages and feedbacks between plant functional diversity and ecosystem processes (Lavorel & Garnier, 2002). In their revised trait-based response and effect framework, Damour et al. (2017) outline hypotheses on how, and at which stages of management, knowledge of plant functional traits enters into agroecological management prescriptions. Damour et al. (2017) outline a key differentiation that functional diversity in agroecosystems (and in turn rates of agroecosystem service provisioning) is comprised of both planned and spontaneous plant diversity, drawn from a pool of available crop cultivars, and non-crop species (such as weeds) drawn from regional species pool respectively. The processes that result in these different functional diversity components are governed by a set of longer term strategic management decisions, shorter term on-farm tactical decisions, as well as multiple interacting socio-economic and biophysical constraints operating in different farms, regions or landscapes. Damour et al. (2017) then discuss how all of these factors lead to prospective differences in the ""functional profiles"" of the targeted agroecological plant communities (i.e. plant assemblages envisioned by farmers when making management decisions) vs. the realized plant communities (i.e. plant communities actually emerging following interactions between management decisions and the biophysical environment). In hypothesizing a sequence under which these different process occur, as well as the factors governing each stage, Damour et al. (2017) contribute a theoretical framework that can be employed to evaluate multiple linkages between different stages of management, on-farm environmental change, functional trait diversity, and the structure and functioning of agroecosystems. Prior reviews and research in the field of trait-based agroecology have highlighted how intense artificial selection has resulted in major shifts in functional trait syndromes of crops (Martin et al., 2017; Milla et al., 2014, 2015), and how this variation then governs rates of agroecosystem functioning (e.g. Garcia-Palacios et al., 2013). Of all themes addressed in the trait-based agroecology literature to date, this area has arguably the strongest empirical support from studies comparing functional trait syndromes in crops vs. wild ancestors (e.g. Milla et al., 2014). In this Special Feature, Roucou et al. (2017) make a major contribution to the theme of understanding the traits other than those strictly related to yield that have also been selected for during the process of crop domestication. Through a comparative evaluation of above- and below-ground functional trait variation among 40 different accessions of wheat (Triticum turgidum), Roucou et al. (2017) provide strong empirical support for the hypothesis that due to evolutionary constraints in functional trait trade-offs, crop breeding has (likely inadvertently) also selected for suites of traits that favour high rates of resource acquisition. Their contribution is essential in defining a more comprehensive understanding of the ecological consequences of an expanded crop domestication syndrome (cf. Meyer et al., 2012), and presents lines of evidence that support the concept of functional trait-based screening for future crops (Milla et al., 2015). More practically, their research presents novel ideas surrounding how complementary functional trait syndromes can contribute to the ecologically based selection of genotypes for intercropped agroecosystems. In the applied ecology literature, studies that evaluate the complex linkages between functional traits, functional diversity and ecosystem functioning have recently begun to explore concepts surrounding ""multi-functionality"": the idea that multiple ecosystem functions should be considered as a management goal, vs. one or a narrow set of functions (Gamfeldt, Hillebrand, & Jonsson, 2008). The concept of multi-functionality has clear implications for trait-based agroecology, where managers may manipulate on-farm diversity to enhance certain ecosystem services beyond yield alone, or alternatively, minimize the net-negative trade-offs that might occur among ecosystem functions (Finney & Kaye, 2017; Schipanski et al., 2014). Research by Blesh (2017) addresses this theme by evaluating hypotheses on how functional diversity in temperate North American organic polyculture systems influences multiple agroecosystem functions. Blesh (2017) contributes novel empirical evidence on how the on-farm selection of crops with complementary functional traits, across a gradient of management-relevant environmental conditions, enhances the multi-functionality of agroecosystems including biological nitrogen (N) fixation (BNF), soil N retention and weed suppression. Blesh (2017) also contributes an important conceptual advancement to applied trait-based ecology, through a more detailed discussion on BNF in functional ecology. On the one hand, trait-based studies commonly view the ability to fix atmospheric N as a binary functional trait, most widely observed in plants in the Fabaceae family (Perez-Harguindeguy et al., 2013); however, Blesh (2017) points to the fact that in agroecosystems, quantitative rates of BNF should be viewed as a key ecosystem function. The work of Blesh (2017) therefore indicates that certain conventions in trait-based ecology surrounding how plant functional traits are defined need to be revisited when applied in agroecological contexts. From a management perspective, Blesh (2017) makes an important contribution to understanding how inter- and intraspecific trait variation across environmental gradients and management systems plays a key role in mediating relationships between functional diversity on agroecosystem functioning. Of all the potential applications of trait-based agroecology, understanding how traits mediate multiple ecological interactions that impact different aspects of nutrient cycles is arguably of the highest importance to farmers and land managers. At the same time, a key theme at the leading edge of trait-based ecology is better understanding how to characterize the diversity and role of functional traits in microbial species (Green, Bohannan, & Whitaker, 2008). Pommier et al. (2017) address both of these themes, by offering a robust example of how a functional trait-based approach provides new insights into our understanding and prediction of linkages between microbial diversity and nutrient cycles. Pommier et al. (2017) distil trait-mediated interactions among plant and microbial species that affect nitrogen (N) dynamics in European-managed grasslands agroecosystems, showing that variation in nitrate and ammonium leaching and soil organic matter content is largely explained by microbial traits including the maximum rate of nitrification and fungi: bacteria ratios. To date, this contribution by Pommier et al. (2017) is among very few studies that incorporate diversity of microbial traits with soil and plant metrics, representing an important advancement in the understanding of microbial-controlled ecosystem services in agroecosystems. Agricultural abandonment has also emerged as a major global socio-economic and land-use trend, with major implications for human well-being, global economic systems and the Earth's biophysical environment. In turn, restoration of agricultural lands is now emerging as both a challenge and opportunity for conservation biology (e.g. Queiroz, Beilin, Folke, & Lindborg, 2014), climate change mitigation (e.g. Pan et al., 2011) and the revitalization of other ecological processes such as nutrient cycling (e.g. Knops & Tilman, 2000). Trait-based approaches to the planning and managing of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in abandoned agricultural lands represent a major emerging vanguard for policymakers and practitioners. In this Special Feature, Lohbeck et al. (2017) provide empirical evidence on how plant functional traits and trait diversity is linked with the restoration of ecosystem functions in degraded agricultural lands. Lohbeck et al. (2017) show that enhancement of functional diversity in degraded East African agroecosystems is positively associated with key parameters of soil remediation including increased organic carbon stocks and decreased soil erosion, while the abundance of invasive species is negatively associated with these parameters. Lohbeck et al. (2017) then suggest that strategies for restoring degraded agricultural land should be informed by principles of functional ecology, with concrete policy- and practice-relevant suggestions that include farmer-lead tree selection during restoration processes. While the conceptual (Damour et al., 2017) and empirical (Blesh, 2017; Lohbeck et al., 2017; Pommier et al., 2017; Roucou et al., 2017) studies in this Special Feature address major gaps in the scientific literature of agroecology, there remains an major ""elephant in the trait-based agroecology room"": do farmers and policymakers base their decisions on the same traits that ecologists consider vital to ecosystem functioning? Earlier papers have summarized the scant evidence that farmers make decisions based on functional ecology prioritized traits (Martin & Isaac, 2015). But here, Isaac et al. (2017) tackle this challenging theme directly by analysing farmer perceptions on how variation in the leaf economics traits of coffee (Coffea arabica) influence the management and understanding of agroecosystem functions. Through in-depth interviews and surveys, coupled with a visual elicitation tool dubbed ""the leaf book,"" Isaac et al. (2017) show that farmers diagnose major management concerns based on, and adjust their practices at least in part according to, intraspecific variation in leaf economics traits. This research represents a major contribution to the literature on how farmers employ an understanding of plant functional traits other than yield alone to manage agroecological systems. From a wider ecological perspective, this research stands as the first to extend a major theme in the functional ecology literature—the concept of trait trade-offs and spectra (Wright et al., 2004)—into the sphere of local ecological knowledge. In theorizing the presence of a ""Farmer Economics Spectrum,"" Isaac et al. (2017) contribute a conceptual advancement through their hypothesis that land managers acknowledge and make decisions based on the trait trade-offs that underpin inter- and intraspecific variation in plant functional biology. Wood (2017) also addresses the policy relevance of functional trait-based agroecology, through a novel empirical analysis that extends methods in functional ecology—namely functional diversity metrics—into the realm of human nutrition. Broadly, Wood (2017) presents arguments that trait-based agroecology must focus beyond the traits that mediate biophysical interactions, and instead also consider traits that are empirically linked with human well-being or other social aspects of agroecosystems. Wood (2017) then illustrates the value of this concept, by employing principles of functional trait diversity to derive a new nutritional diversity metric: potential nutritional adequacy (PNA). This metric represents a major advance in how plant functional trait diversity can be empirically linked with the nutritional outcomes associated with enhancing on-farm diversity. In his application of this new metric using data from Senegal, Wood (2017) shows that neither intensification nor diversification represent a singular approach to increasing PNA in small-holder agroecosystems; this represents a more measured and policy-realistic approach to addressing questions of food security, as compared to arguments that fall on one side of the ""intensification vs. extensification"" debate (Foley et al., 2011). Wood (2017) then proposes that PNA could be paired with other indicators of environmental outcomes as a means to assess the joint benefits of, or prospective trade-offs among, the provisioning of food security, food sovereignty and other ecosystem services in agroecosystems. The research in this Special Feature demonstrates how a functional trait-based approach represents meaningful advances in integrating leading edge ecological sciences into an understanding of the linkages between agricultural diversity and agroecosystem functioning. The papers here address themes in agriculture that span from genetic to regional scales of investigation. Taken as a whole, we hope that they represent at least a small step in having trait-based agroecology contribute to the sustainable management of agricultural systems, the restoration of degraded agricultural lands, the understanding of the crop nutrition-food security nexus and the overall enhancement of agroecosystem functioning. Based on the empirical and conceptual advances put forth in this Special Feature, clearly there is a role for a trait-based approach to agroecology in guiding the composition and function of sustainable agroecosystems. Contemporary sustainable agriculture is more relevant than ever, particularly under the United Nations SDGs launched in 2015: 17 global goals with 169 total targets, designed to frame a global sustainable development agenda through the year 2030. Generally, the SDGs fall into the two primary realms: socio-economic development such as human health, education, social justice and inequality, and environmental sustainability including clean water provisioning, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and terrestrial and aquatic resource conservation. Many of the SDGs straddle this broad divide, perhaps no more than SDG 2 that calls for ""End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture."" This SDG, which entails targets surrounding agricultural production and sustainability, provides a clear opportunity for trait-based agroecology to inform a better understanding of the types of farming systems that can move towards meeting these targets. For instance, SDG 2 Target 2.4 calls for the implementation of ""…resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters, and that progressively improve land and soil quality."" Sustainable Development Goal 2 Target 2.5 calls for the maintenance of a ""…genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants, farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks."" If not explicitly, the promise of trait-based agroecology is well-encapsulated by language within the SDGs that indicates a strong role for agroecology (and applied ecology more broadly) in helping to address some of the world's most pressing socio-economic and environmental concerns. In agriculture broadly, the realized and potential impacts of climate change, depletion of soil resources, as well as the loss of crop and non-crop diversity, require new approaches to frame, test and prescribe management for resilient agroecosystems. Trait-based ecology has advanced our understanding of the causes and consequences of shifts in ecological functioning of natural ecosystems, and based on the research in this Special Feature, represents a novel means of advancing our understanding of agroecosystem structure, function and performance. Most importantly, as this Special Feature demonstrates, trait-based approaches can play a key role in diagnosing crop–environment interactions, predicting crop and non-crop interactions, understanding future impacts of crop domestication and, ultimately, prescribing ecologically sound and sustainable management practices.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2003563,Contrasting impacts of competition on ecological and social trait evolution in songbirds,"Competition between closely related species has long been viewed as a powerful selective force that drives trait diversification, thereby generating phenotypic diversity over macroevolutionary timescales. However, although the impact of interspecific competition has been documented in a handful of iconic insular radiations, most previous studies have focused on traits involved in resource use, and few have examined the role of competition across large, continental radiations. Thus, the extent to which broad-scale patterns of phenotypic diversity are shaped by competition remain largely unclear, particularly for social traits. Here, we estimate the effect of competition between interacting lineages by applying new phylogenetic models that account for such interactions to an exceptionally complete dataset of resource-use traits and social signaling traits for the entire radiation of tanagers (Aves, Thraupidae), the largest family of songbirds. We find that interspecific competition strongly influences the evolution of traits involved in resource use, with a weaker effect on plumage signals, and very little effect on song. Our results provide compelling evidence that interspecific exploitative competition contributes to ecological trait diversification among coexisting species, even in a large continental radiation. In comparison, signal traits mediating mate choice and social competition seem to diversify under different evolutionary models, including rapid diversification in the allopatric stage of speciation.",https://openalex.org/W2785617100,15ab0c31c232d716ffe48f6a25eac008e2bbe64c,0,True,0.9833582639694214,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13378,From apparent competition to facilitation: Impacts of consumer niche construction on the coexistence and stability of consumer‐resource communities,"Abstract In addition to their direct trophic effects, some consumers have a positive indirect effect on their resource, due to niche construction. A predator can facilitate its prey resource acquisition, through prey transport, or through modifications of nutrient cycling. Alternatively, a predator may defend its prey against other predators, or actively manage it, as in agriculture, which is found in numerous taxa such as humans, ants, beetles, fishes and microbes. Here, we investigate the ecological consequences of considering such positive effects in a simple two‐resource–one‐consumer module, in which the consumer has a positive effect on one of the resources. We consider several scenarios, in which the positive effect on the resource is either not costly, that is resulting from a by‐product of the consumer phenotype such as nutrient cycling, or costly. The cost either decreases the exploitation of the cultivated resource or the opportunity to forage the alternative resource. We investigate how the intensity of niche construction impacts species coexistence, the distribution of biomass among the three species and the stability of the community. We show that by modifying the trophic interactions in the module, niche construction alters the apparent competition between the resources, thereby impacting their coexistence. When niche construction has little or no cost to the consumer, it leads to higher consumer and cultivated resource densities, while decreasing the alternative resource density. Alternatively, when niche construction has higher costs, the alternative resource can increase in density, niche construction thereby leading to the emergence of facilitative interactions among resource species.

https://doi.org/10.1890/04-1136,ECOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF A RESOURCE POLYMORPHISM IN ZENAIDA DOVES OF BARBADOS,"Despite the important place of resource polymorphisms in ecological and evolutionary theories, the reason why a group of individuals sharing a common environment should diverge in the use of the resources remains poorly known. Given the existence of distinct open niches and the relaxation of interspecific competition, niche theory suggests two possible mechanisms: resource competition between conspecifics and trade-offs in resource use efficiency. We investigated the importance of these explanations in a foraging polymorphism recently developed by Zenaida Doves (Zenaida aurita) on the West Indian island of Barbados. In this polymorphism, individuals either aggressively defend feeding territories from conspecifics or feed in large unaggressive groups with conspecifics. Combining field observations and a cage experiment, we found no evidence that the polymorphism is primarily driven by age- or sex-related differences, or that it results from morphological feeding specializations or dietary preferences. Instead, our results support the hypothesis that individual specializations arise from contest competition. In the study area, competition for territories was intense, with very little undefended space left between territories and owners frequently involved in territorial contests. Replacement of territory holders from year to year was low compared to the number of potential recruits, implying that many doves were incapable of securing a territory. Approximately half the doves at territorial sites did not hold a territory but wandered between them as floaters. Compared with territory holders, floaters were smaller and had shorter wings, traits that in this species mediate territory defense. Yet floaters did not differ from group feeding doves on these morphological traits. This suggests that group feeders are floaters that shift to an alternative resource. The new resource appears to be suboptimal, as indicated by the fact that group feeders were in worse body condition than doves from the territorial sites. Taken together, our results suggest that the resource polymorphism in Zenaida Doves is primarily driven by competition for territories, which forces less competitive individuals to use alternative, subobtimal resources.",https://openalex.org/W2108436819,13274411bc0c20768eadd7f9a08dd4bcb6d2ff98,0,True,0.9569430947303772,0
https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.0504,Trait-mediated competition drives an ant invasion and alters functional diversity,"The assumption that differences in species' traits reflect their different niches has long influenced how ecologists infer processes from assemblage patterns. For instance, many assess the importance of environmental filtering versus classical limiting-similarity competition in driving biological invasions by examining whether invaders’ traits are similar or dissimilar to those of residents, respectively. However, mounting evidence suggests that hierarchical differences between species' trait values can distinguish their competitive abilities (e.g. for the same resource) instead of their niches. Whether such trait-mediated hierarchical competition explains invasions and structures assemblages is less explored. We integrate morphological, dietary, physiological and behavioural trait analyses to test whether environmental filtering, limiting-similarity competition or hierarchical competition explain invasions by fire ants on ant assemblages. We detect both competition mechanisms; invasion success is not only explained by limiting similarity in body size and thermal tolerance (presumably allowing the invader to exploit different niches from residents), but also by the invader's superior position in trait hierarchies reflecting competition for common trophic resources. We find that the two mechanisms generate complex assemblage-level functional diversity patterns—overdispersion in some traits, clustering in others—suggesting their effects are likely missed by analyses restricted to a few traits and composite trait diversity measures.",https://openalex.org/W4283709393,90c4b430f2d78721be333de757c02376e3d42156,0,True,0.9622378945350647,0
https://doi.org/10.1890/04-0719,SCARED TO DEATH? THE EFFECTS OF INTIMIDATION AND CONSUMPTION IN PREDATOR–PREY INTERACTIONS,"Predation is a central feature of ecological communities. Most theoretical and empirical studies of predation focus on the consequences of predators consuming their prey. Predators reduce prey population densities through direct consumption (a density-mediated interaction, DMI), a process that may indirectly affect the prey's resources, competitors, and other predators. However, predators can also affect prey population density by stimulating costly defensive strategies. The costs of these defensive strategies can include reduced energy income, energetic investment in defensive structures, lower mating success, increased vulnerability to other predators, or emigration. Theoretical and empirical studies confirm the existence of these induced costs (trait-mediated interactions, TMIs); however, the relative importance of intimidation (TMI) and consumption (DMI) effects remains an open question. We conducted a meta-analysis assessing the magnitude of both TMIs and DMIs in predator–prey interactions. On average, the impact of intimidation on prey demographics was at least as strong as direct consumption (63% and 51% the size of the total predator effect, respectively). This contrast is even more pronounced when we consider the cascading effects of predators on their prey's resources: density effects attenuated through food chains, while TMIs remained strong, rising to 85% of the total predator effect. Predators can thus strongly influence resource density even if they consume few prey items. Finally, intimidation was more important in aquatic than terrestrial ecosystems. Our results suggest that the costs of intimidation, traditionally ignored in predator–prey ecology, may actually be the dominant facet of trophic interactions.",https://openalex.org/W2108031508,39cefd6f60d3a7f4196f1bb020b36efb5215d8b1,0,True,0.9884405732154846,0
https://doi.org/10.1890/es14-00365.1,"A multifaceted trophic cascade in a detritus‐based system: density‐, trait‐, or processing‐chain‐mediated effects?","We investigated three pathways by which predators on an intermediate trophic level may produce a trophic cascade in detritus‐based systems. Predators may increase lower trophic levels (bacteria) by reducing density of bacteriovores, by altering behavior of bacteriovores, and by processing living bacteriovores into carcasses, feces, and dissolved nutrients that are substrates for bacteria. We tested these pathways in laboratory experiments with mosquitoes in water‐filled containers. Larval Toxorhynchites rutilus prey on larval Aedes triseriatus, which feed on bacteria. Using containers stocked with oak leaf infusion as a bacterial substrate, we compared bacterial productivity at 7 and 14 days for: prey alone; prey with a predator; and prey with predation cues but no predator. Controls contained no larvae, either with predation cues or without cues. Predation cues in the control treatment increased bacterial abundance at 7 days, but this effect waned by 14 days. Aedes triseriatus larvae reduced bacterial abundance significantly at 14 days. Predator cues and real predation both eliminated the negative effect of A. triseriatus on bacterial abundance. Predation cues reduced survivorship of A. triseriatus larvae at 14 days, however this effect was smaller than the effect of real predation. We further tested effects of residues from predation as cues or as detritus in a second experiment in which A. triseriatus were killed at similar rates by: real predators ; mechanical damage without the predator and carcasses left as detritus; or mechanical damage and carcasses removed. No prey larvae were killed in controls. Bacterial productivity was greater with real predation than in all other treatments and greater when prey larvae were killed or killed and removed, than in controls. Thus we find evidence that all three pathways contribute to the trophic cascade from T. rutilus to bacteria in tree hole systems.",https://openalex.org/W2080441584,d013f017b78d8b32f3208c2455b4de1071c20467,0,True,0.9819281101226807,0

When predation levels are high, this apparent competition can culminate in a prey species being displaced. Coupling quantitative genetics and Lotka-Volterra models, we study how predator evolution alters this and other ecological outcomes. These models account for a trade-off between the predator's attack rates on two prey species. We provide a mathematical characterization of a strong form of persistence--permanence--for which there is a global attractor bounded away from extinction. When the evolutionary dynamics occur at a sufficiently slower time scale than the ecological dynamics, we also characterize attractors and their basins' of attraction using singular perturbation theory and a graphical approach to the eco-evolutionary dynamics. Our results show that eco-evolutionary feedbacks can mediate permanence at intermediate trade-offs in the attack rates. However, at strong trade-offs, permanence is lost. Despite this loss of permanence, there can be attractors supporting coexistence. These attractors, however, may coincide with attractors at which the predator is excluded. Our results highlight that evo-evolutionary feedbacks can alter community structure by mediating coexistence or leading to trait-dependent alternative stable states.",https://openalex.org/W2949425566,ecd71d34e2daee066f8a6b7241d843f3256d31c0,0,True,0.9933124780654907,0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12862-022-01991-1,Symbiont-conferred immunity interacts with effects of parasitoid genotype and intraguild predation to affect aphid immunity in a clone-specific fashion,"Host-parasite interactions represent complex co-evolving systems in which genetic and associated phenotypic variation within a species can significantly affect selective pressures on traits, such as host immunity, in the other. While often modelled as a two-species interaction between host and parasite, some systems are more complex due to effects of host enemies, intraguild predation, and endosymbionts, all of which affect host immunity. However, it remains unclear how these factors, combined with genetic variation in the host and the parasitoid, affect host immunity. We address this question in an important agricultural pest system, the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, which shows significant intraspecific variability in immunity to the parasitoid wasp Aphidius ervi. In a complex experiment, we use a quantitative genetic design in the parasitoid, two ecologically different aphid lineages and the aphid lion Chrysoperla carnea as an intraguild predator to unravel the complex interdependencies. We demonstrate that aphid immunity as a key trait of this complex host-parasite system is affected by intraspecific genetic variation in the parasitoid and the aphid, the interaction of intraspecific genetic variation with intraguild predation, and differences in defensive endosymbionts between aphid lineages. Further, aphid lineages differ in their altruistic behaviour whereby infested aphids move away from the clonal colony to facilitate predation. Our findings provide new insights into the influence of endosymbiosis and genetic variability in an important host-parasitoid system which is influenced by natural enemies of the parasitoid and the aphid, including its endosymbiont communities. We show that endosymbiosis can mediate or influence the evolutionary arms race between aphids and their natural enemies. The outcome of these complex interactions between species has significant implications for understanding the evolution of multitrophic systems, including eco-agricultural settings.",https://openalex.org/W4220678686,03f25d27e2f082c2de8c4ba76c566c462059ab50,0,True,0.9198583960533142,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12118,Trait variability differs between leaf and wood tissues across ecological scales in subtropical forests,"Abstract Question Revealing how plant traits vary over disparate spatial scales and how ecological processes mediate such variation is important for understanding plant community assembly. However, to what extent does the distribution of trait variation among ecological scales differ between leaf and wood tissues and between physical and chemical traits? What are the consequences of resource competition and/or habitat filtering on the community assembly with respect to differences between leaf and wood traits, and between physical and chemical traits? Location Subtropical evergreen broad‐leaved forests in five sites in the Ningbo area (29°41–50′ N, 121°36–52′ E) in eastern China. Methods Traits of 96 woody plant species were sampled and variation of ten physical‐ and chemical‐based leaf and wood traits were partitioned across six ecological scales (site, plot, species, individual plant, twigs and leaf age) using a linear mixed model. Results From individual plant to site scales, variance partitions were distinct between leaf and wood traits. In leaf tissues, physical and chemical traits showed a consistent pattern, with the majority of variation found among species and individual plants, with little among plots. For wood tissues, the largest variation in physical traits was at the species and individual plant scales, with the largest variation in chemical traits observed at the plot scale. Variance partition was markedly similar within and across species. Conclusion Leaf and wood traits vary differently in relation to ecological scale, suggesting that trait variability is tissue‐specific. The large variability of wood traits at the plot scale suggests a strong habitat filtering process. The large variation in leaf traits within plots may reflect niche differentiation across species and the importance of intra‐specific variation that affects species co‐existence. Our study demonstrated that physical and chemical traits may be independent. These decoupled trait axes may increase the dimensionality of niche space and facilitate species co‐existence in forest communities.",https://openalex.org/W2164897642,aa779ff6d961da4e383f57d0be16e4ce2632c869,0,True,0.9101979732513428,0
https://doi.org/10.2980/15-3-3135,Ventral colour polymorphism correlates with alternative behavioural patterns in female common lizards (<i>Lacerta vivipara</i>),"AbstractIn the common lizard, female competition for resources is likely to be a strong selective pressure that has enhanced the evolution of conspicuous traits. Female common lizards display a polymorphism in ventral colour correlated with differences in reproduction, dispersal, and susceptibility to resource competition. We tested the hypothesis that this polymorphism is correlated with differences in behaviour in a social context. We studied the agonistic behaviour (aggression and avoidance) and social stress of females of different colours during laboratory-staged encounters with a limiting resource. We found that the behaviour of females was affected by their own colour, or the colour of their opponent, or both. Such alternative behavioural patterns might reflect differences in competitive ability. Orange females were the least aggressive and the most likely to avoid social interactions, and thus could be a weaker competitor. Yellow females were rarely exposed to aggression and often made their opponents flee, and thus might have higher resource-holding potential. Mixed females were aggressive but were also often exposed to aggression, and displayed the highest stress level, which could be characteristic of an intermediate or condition-dependent resource-holding potential. The possibility that ventral colour is used in social interactions to signal resource-holding potential is discussed.RésuméChez le lézard vivipare, la compétition pour les ressources entre femelles est probablement une pression de sélection forte, qui pourrait avoir favorisé l'évolution de signaux visibles. Les femelles lézards vivipares présentent un polymorphisme de couleur ventrale, corrélé à des différences au niveau de la reproduction, de la dispersion, et de la sensibilité à la compétition pour les ressources. Nous avons testé l'hypothèse que ce polymorphisme est corrélé à des différences de comportement dans un contexte social. Nous avons étudié le comportement agonistique (agression et évitement) et le stress social de femelles de différentes couleurs au cours de confrontations en laboratoire en présence d'une ressource limitante. Nous avons trouvé que le comportement des femelles était influencé par leur propre couleur, celle de la femelle opposante, ou l'interaction des deux. Une telle variation comportementale pourrait refléter des différences individuelles de potentiel compétitif. L'un des morphes de couleur était le moins agressif et le plus enclin à éviter les interactions sociales, il pourrait donc être le moins compétitif. Au contraire, un autre morphe était rarement agressé et provoquait souvent la fuite de son opposant, il pourrait avoir un fort potentiel compétitif. Enfin, le troisième morphe était agressif, mais également souvent agressé, et montrait le plus haut niveau de stress social, ce qui pourrait être caractéristique d'un potentiel compétitif intermédiaire ou dépendant de la condition. Nous discutons de la possibilité que la couleur ventrale soit utilisée dans les interactions sociales pour signaler le potentiel compétitif des individus.Keywords: laboratory-staged encountersresource holding potentialsignalssocial competitionMots-clés: compétition socialeconfrontations en laboratoirepotentiel compétitifsignaux",https://openalex.org/W2140912150,8dc3d17d923c78d3f24d8d2ee04deb94434a781a,0,True,0.9604169130325317,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15430.x,Architectural and growth traits differ in effects on performance of clonal plants: an analysis using a field-parameterized simulation model,"Individual traits are often assumed to be linked in a straightforward manner to plant performance and processes such as population growth, competition and community dynamics. However, because no trait functions in isolation in an organism, the effect of any one trait is likely to be at least somewhat contingent on other trait values. Thus, to the extent that the suite of trait values differs among species, the magnitude and even direction of correlation between values of any particular trait and performance is likely to differ among species. Working with a group of clonal plant species, we assessed the degree of this contingency and therefore the extent to which the assumption of simple and general linkages between traits and performance is valid. To do this, we parameterized a highly calibrated, spatially explicit, individual-based model of clonal plant population dynamics and then manipulated one trait at a time in the context of realistic values of other traits for each species. The model includes traits describing growth, resource allocation, response to competition, as well as architectural traits that determine spatial spread. The model was parameterized from a short-term (3 month) experiment and then validated with a separate, longer term (two year) experiment for six clonal wetland sedges, Carex lasiocarpa, Carex sterilis, Carex stricta, Cladium mariscoides, Scirpus acutus and Scirpus americanus. These plants all co-occur in fens in southeastern Michigan and represent a spectrum of clonal growth forms from strong clumpers to runners with long rhizomes. Varying growth, allocation and competition traits produced the largest and most uniform responses in population growth among species, while variation in architectural traits produced responses that were smaller and more variable among species. This is likely due to the fact that growth and competition traits directly affect mean ramet size and number of ramets, which are direct components of population biomass. In contrast, architectural and allocation traits determine spatial distribution of biomass; in the long run, this also affects population size, but its net effect is more likely to be mediated by other traits. Such differences in how traits affect plant performance are likely to have implications for interspecific interactions and community structure, as well as on the interpretation and usefulness of single trait optimality models.",https://openalex.org/W1998761119,4a0b2037c61bbfb5c6c6d9747adc861cb6478fd6,0,True,0.9651394486427307,0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.02116,Environmental Nutrient Supply Directly Alters Plant Traits but Indirectly Determines Virus Growth Rate,"Ecological stoichiometry and resource competition theory both predict that nutrient rates and ratios can alter infectious disease dynamics. Pathogens such as viruses hijack nutrient rich host metabolites to complete multiple steps of their epidemiological cycle. As the synthesis of these molecules requires nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), environmental supply rates and ratios of N and P to hosts can directly limit disease dynamics. Environmental nutrient supplies also may alter virus epidemiology indirectly by changing host phenotype or the dynamics of coinfecting pathogens. We tested whether host nutrient supplies and coinfection control pathogen growth within hosts and transmission to new hosts, either directly or through modifications of plant tissue chemistry (i.e. content and stoichiometric ratios of nutrients), host phenotypic traits, or among-pathogen interactions. We examined two widespread plant viruses (BYDV-PAV and CYDV-RPV) in cultivated oats (Avena sativa) grown along a range of N and of P supply rates. N and P supply rates altered plant tissue chemistry and phenotypic traits; however environmental nutrient supplies and plant tissue content and ratios of nutrients did not directly alter virus titer. Infection with CYDV-RPV altered plant traits and resulted in thicker plant leaves (i.e. higher leaf mass per area) and there was a positive correlation between CYDV-RPV titer and leaf mass per area. CYDV-RPV titer was reduced by the presence of a competitor, BYDV-PAV, and higher CYDV-RPV titer led to more severe chlorotic symptoms. In our experimental conditions, virus transmission was unaffected by nutrient supply rates, co-infection, plant stoichiometry, or plant traits, although nutrient supply rates have been shown to increase infection and coinfection rates. This work provides a robust test of the role of plant nutrient content and ratios in the dynamics of globally important pathogens and reveals a more complex relationship between within-host virus growth and alterations of plant traits. A deeper understanding of the differential effects of environmental nutrient supplies on virus epidemiology and ecology is particularly relevant given the rapid increase of nutrients flowing into Earth's ecosystems as a result of human activities.",https://openalex.org/W2765609484,51a0200bb06ba73bb6a65c7681a042b2fd847bce,0,True,0.9913283586502075,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.13023,Fine‐root and mycorrhizal traits help explain ecosystem processes and responses to global change,"'Root systems of perennial plants possess a high degree of complexity and the first step to understanding this complexity is to realize that not all roots and root systems are the same.' In this report, we discuss two key themes that emerged from the International Symposium on Critical Zone Biochemistry and Belowground Ecological Research. First, we discuss the need to identify broad patterns of root and mycorrhizal trait variation, both across and within species, as an effective means to understand and predict variation in function across species and sites, and through time. Second, we assert that, to fully understand the role roots and mycorrhizal fungi play in ecosystem processes, a broader perspective that relates their function to both short-term activity (e.g. acquisition of soil resources) and long-term changes in ecosystem function and community composition is required. Finally, we emphasize the need for a global effort in root and mycorrhizal research to synchronize methods of data collection and sharing for more powerful comparisons of belowground activity. Linking plant traits with function has been a valuable approach for understanding plant systems, particularly above ground, where traits including xylem anatomy, leaf mass per unit area, and leaf nitrogen (N) content often serve as indicators of plant hydraulic conductance, leaf lifespan, and photosynthetic capacity, respectively. Below ground, wide variation in both root and mycorrhizal traits has been observed (Fig. 1) and linking this trait variation to ecosystem processes was a common theme during much of the meeting. More broadly, developing greater appreciation of root and mycorrhizal function across species and environments greatly enhances understanding of whole-ecosystem processes, as roots and soil fungi have been identified as key drivers of C and nutrient cycling in terrestrial systems (Ostonen et al., 2011; Iversen et al., 2012; Clemmensen et al., 2013). Root systems of perennial plants possess a high degree of complexity and the first step to understanding this complexity is to realize that not all roots and root systems are the same. Even among distal, first-order roots, pioneer and fibrous roots maintain morphological differences at birth that are intrinsically linked to their function (Zadworny & Eissenstat, 2011). These and other differences in root anatomy, morphology, and physiology among and within species often relate to differences in root function (Fig. 2). For example, variations in root diameter, root length density, N concentration, root hair density, and mycorrhizal colonization all have links to total plant uptake capacity and represent tradeoffs among different acquisition strategies. Variation in basic root traits may also provide information on how plastic species of plants may be in response to changing environments. At the meeting, David Eissenstat (Pennsylvania State University, USA) discussed recent work in a common garden where fertilizer application in localized patches increased root survivorship in species with smaller root diameters (more plastic response) but not in those with larger root diameters (less plastic response) (Adams et al., 2013). Extending beyond roots and further exploring the soil, mycorrhizal fungi form an intimate symbiosis with many plant species and represent the most distal portion of the root–fungal resource acquisition system. Here again, systematic differences in mycorrhizal traits can provide useful clues regarding their activity and persistence in soils (Fig. 2). Recent reviews have highlighted the potential for categorizing mycorrhizal fungi based on observable/measurable traits that then relate to their function and broader ecosystem impacts (Van Der Heijden & Scheublin, 2007; Chagnon et al., 2013; Phillips et al., 2013; Koide et al., 2014). For example, at the meeting Erik Hobbie (University of New Hampshire, USA) presented recent work showing that C and N isotopes can be used to infer activity and exploration strategies of ectomycorrhizal fungi (Hobbie & Agerer, 2009), while others have reported that the degree of fungal tissue melanization may relate to stress tolerance and persistence (Fernandez & Koide, 2013). Indeed, the high diversity and often cryptic nature of mycorrhizal fungi may necessitate the use of functional traits to better understand mycorrhizal form, functional relationships, and ecosystem effects. Ecosystem responses to climate change, altered land use, and species invasions are often the result of complex interactions among multiple ecosystem components. As such, observing below- and aboveground processes independently may result in limited and potentially erroneous conclusions. Based on a series of experiments conducted using species common in grasslands of Inner Mongolia, China, Wen-Hao Zhang (Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China) presented evidence that shifts in species abundance with N deposition, long thought to be the result of increasing light competition, may result from multiple factors including a decrease in soil pH which increases the availability of manganese (Mn), leading to Mn toxicity in forbs (W-H. Zhang, unpublished). As a result of fundamental differences between dicots and monocots in their biochemical pathways for uptake of Mn and iron, grasses were favored over forbs and overall ecosystem diversity declined. Interestingly, similar declines in sugar maple (Acer saccharum) have been observed with chronic N deposition in parts of the northeast USA. Here again, declines resulted from altered plant nutrition that first began with an increased availability of Mn in acidified soils and reduced availability of primary nutrients (St Clair & Lynch, 2005). In both ecosystems, only by observing aboveground portions of ecosystems in the context of belowground processes could changes in ecosystem function be understood. Species invasions offer some of the most compelling examples demonstrating the need to integrate belowground processes into a whole-ecosystem perspective. Indeed, many studies now link interactions among roots and soil biota as important factors determining the success of an invading plant species. For example, the success of the invasive garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) is attributed, at least in part, to its ability to inhibit mycorrhizal fungi, thereby reducing the ability of many competing plant species to obtain soil resources (Stinson et al., 2006). Recent work presented by Ian Dickie (Lincoln University, New Zealand) provides evidence for facilitation of invasive Pinus contorta in New Zealand by co-invasion of ectomycorrhizal symbionts which may be further mediated by invasions of nonnative mammals (Dickie et al., 2010; J. R. Wood et al., unpublished). This is a fascinating example of how multi-stage and multi-component interactions dictate the composition and function of many terrestrial ecosystems, including novel ecosystems created through concurrent invasions of multiple species from multiple continents. Currently, many ecosystem- and global-scale models express highly simplified descriptions of root processes with little to no mechanistic function tied to spatial and temporal patterns of root growth (Smithwick et al., 2014). Furthermore, few models explicitly incorporate mycorrhizal fungi requiring C and nutrient fluxes through mycorrhizal biomass to be captured indirectly if at all (but see Orwin et al., 2011; Phillips et al., 2013; Deckmyn et al., 2014). However, accurately modeling ecosystem processes along environmental gradients or responses to global change factors requires greater empirical understanding of root and mycorrhizal processes in conjunction with their impacts on ecosystem functioning (Ostonen et al., 2011; Iversen et al., 2012). To that end, some of the most important discussions in Beijing were centered on the development of a functional database of root traits and a network linking rhizosphere–ecosystem research across the globe. Development of an improved, publicly available database coupled with an organized network of sites investigating links between above- and belowground ecology could provide an efficient way to gain and supply data needed by modelers. Led by Colleen Iversen (Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA), efforts are underway to develop a comprehensive root trait database through expansions of the existing TRY plant trait database (www.try-db.org) and additional service through Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) data centers. Importantly, this database will (1) accommodate submission of root traits by individual root order, which enables more meaningful comparisons across species, and (2) emphasize traits and processes with specific relevance to terrestrial biosphere models. Furthermore, recent efforts in China have also seen the development of a domestic network of sites focused on linking belowground and whole-ecosystem processes, RhizoNet. Though in its infancy, this and other networks may be developed into coordinated global networks where open exchange of ideas and research methodologies will greatly improve cross-site data comparisons and enhance overall appreciation of terrestrial processes. Together, these and other efforts to identify global patterns of root and mycorrhizal traits across diverse phylogenies will pay dividends in the future as we seek to understand root and fungal responses to environmental perturbations. As consistent patterns emerge, these basic trait data can then be used to inform novel hypotheses testing the mechanisms that determine variation in rhizosphere function. Ultimately, understanding rhizosphere processes may be the key to accurately describing and anticipating global patterns of ecosystem functioning today and into the future.",https://openalex.org/W2017456328,22d6230b7467bde93a6418d0030293756f50945a,0,True,0.9891152381896973,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12403,The sign of cascading predator effects varies with prey traits in a detrital system,"Theory and experiments show that the nature of 'green' trophic cascades, between predators, herbivores and plants, varies with several key species traits: predator hunting mode and predator and prey habitat domains. Meanwhile, 'brown' cascades between predators, environment-modifying detritivores and plants have been largely overlooked and the roles of species traits, particularly prey traits, in determining the nature of these cascades remains unclear. We hypothesize that, in predator-detritivore-plant interaction chains, the burrowing ability of plant-facilitating detritivores determines their response to predators and thus the sign of indirect effect transmitted. In the dung-decomposer food web of an alpine meadow, we predicted that in the presence of above-ground predacious beetles: (i) non-burrowing detritivores will suffer mortality due to predation and transmit negative indirect effects to plants, whereas (ii) burrowing detritivores will escape predation by retreating deeper into the soil, transmitting positive indirect effects to plants. In support of predictions, experiments showed that a single species of predacious beetle (i) reduced the density of the non-burrowing species and indirectly reduced dung loss rate, soil nutrient concentrations and plant biomass, but (ii) drove the burrowing species deeper, indirectly improved soil conditions and increased plant biomass. These results show that the burrowing ability of a detritivore can determine whether it transmits a negative indirect effect mediated by a reduction in its density, or a positive indirect effect mediated by its behavioural response to predation risk. We call for further tests of our detritivore-trait hypothesis in different regions and ecosystems to further develop a general trait-based framework for trophic cascades in detrital food webs. We further advance the general hypothesis that the locomotion traits of prey species (e.g. burrowing/flying ability) may help explain their behavioural response to predation risk and the nature of indirect effect they transmit from predators to plants.",https://openalex.org/W1549655949,37c64db42f8d515428388ea8c8cdd61dadaabf7b,0,True,0.9955645203590393,0
https://doi.org/10.3390/d12100397,Can Functional Traits Explain Plant Coexistence? A Case Study with Tropical Lianas and Trees,"Organisms are adapted to their environment through a suite of anatomical, morphological, and physiological traits. These functional traits are commonly thought to determine an organism’s tolerance to environmental conditions. However, the differences in functional traits among co-occurring species, and whether trait differences mediate competition and coexistence is still poorly understood. Here we review studies comparing functional traits in two co-occurring tropical woody plant guilds, lianas and trees, to understand whether competing plant guilds differ in functional traits and how these differences may help to explain tropical woody plant coexistence. We examined 36 separate studies that compared a total of 140 different functional traits of co-occurring lianas and trees. We conducted a meta-analysis for ten of these functional traits, those that were present in at least five studies. We found that the mean trait value between lianas and trees differed significantly in four of the ten functional traits. Lianas differed from trees mainly in functional traits related to a faster resource acquisition life history strategy. However, the lack of difference in the remaining six functional traits indicates that lianas are not restricted to the fast end of the plant life–history continuum. Differences in functional traits between lianas and trees suggest these plant guilds may coexist in tropical forests by specializing in different life–history strategies, but there is still a significant overlap in the life–history strategies between these two competing guilds.",https://openalex.org/W3092745668,b6fdcc1c9f9e48eef4878264e360899e3b5465cb,0,True,0.9273396730422974,0
https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2013.0879,Parasites that change predator or prey behaviour can have keystone effects on community composition,"Parasites play pivotal roles in structuring communities, often via indirect interactions with non-host species. These effects can be density-mediated (through mortality) or trait-mediated (behavioural, physiological and developmental), and may be crucial to population interactions, including biological invasions. For instance, parasitism can alter intraguild predation (IGP) between native and invasive crustaceans, reversing invasion outcomes. Here, we use mathematical models to examine how parasite-induced trait changes influence the population dynamics of hosts that interact via IGP. We show that trait-mediated indirect interactions impart keystone effects, promoting or inhibiting host coexistence. Parasites can thus have strong ecological impacts, even if they have negligible virulence, underscoring the need to consider trait-mediated effects when predicting effects of parasites on community structure in general and biological invasions in particular.",https://openalex.org/W2164023607,9f8e6da50b24326bbc7bc08ec6fe8d65ce534ace,0,True,0.9705756902694702,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.03800,Direct litter interference and indirect soil competitive effects of two contrasting phenotypes of a spiny legume shrub drive the forb composition of an oromediterranean community,"Contrasting phenotypes of foundation species are known to differentially affect understorey plants. However, there is little knowledge on both the mechanisms of competition (resource competition versus interference) of stress‐tolerant phenotypes and the importance of indirect interactions. In an oromediterranean community from Mount Lebanon we assessed the effects on understorey forbs of two contrasting phenotypes, a tight competitive from stressful habitat and a loose facilitative from more benign habitat. In a dry south and a wet north exposure we assessed short‐term resource effects removing shrub canopy and long‐term soil effects (including litter interference) with the comparison of forb performances in adjacent naturally open areas vs no shrub. Indirect effects were quantified through the removal of grasses. Abundance, richness and biomass of forbs were measured in all treatments after one year of experiment, together with litter depth and soil moisture. We found strong direct negative soil effects of the tight phenotype on all forb performances and in particular in south exposure. These effects were due to litter interference on water availability, but not to resource competition. They were likely explained by the high hydrophobicity of organic matter accumulating in the stressful habitat of the tight phenotype. We also found an indirect competition of the loose phenotype for forb richness, due to its direct positive soil effect on competitive grasses, and in particular in south exposure. Our results improve our knowledge on the importance of litter interference in dry nutrient‐poor habitats and the role of indirect interactions in phenotypic effects on understorey species.",https://openalex.org/W2564056314,02ac7247120f836485b3890824d973bc400c4f5e,0,True,0.9393941164016724,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.16266,Functional basis of primary succession: Traits of the pioneer microbes,"Primary succession describes the establishment of new ecosystems through the colonization of barren substrates (Odum, 1969). Bacteria are typically the first colonizers, which initiate key processes that enable ecosystem establishment and provide resources for fungi, plants, and animals to colonize later. The functional roles of these pioneer microbes are varied; for example, they can weather and detoxify environments to increase habitability, provide organic carbon and bioavailable nitrogen through carbon and nitrogen fixation, and form mutualistic relationships with plant species (Abdulla, 2009; Richardson & Simpson, 2011). As taxonomic and functional diversity increases over annual to decadal scales, communities in successional ecosystems transition from a collection of pioneer microbial species towards a robust and complex ecosystem (Álvarez-Molina et al., 2012; Brown & Jumpponen, 2015; Frouz et al., 2016). Much literature has explored plant community succession, resulting in a strong understanding of the nature, traits, and interactions of early and late colonizers and the development of strong ecological theory to explain these processes. However, understanding of pioneer microbial communities remains rudimentary, with most literature focusing on taxonomic composition rather than functional traits of colonizing bacteria. Numerous key questions remain, for example: How do the first microbes survive and grow in a barren and often hostile environment with minimal nutrients? How do microbes modify their environment for succeeding generations and species? How do these microbes interact with each other, plants, and animals as the new ecosystem develops? We propose here a series of study systems, methodological approaches, and ecological frameworks to address these questions. In turn, a better understanding of primary succession has broad implications for understanding ecological theory, biogeochemical processes, and responses to climate change. Moreover, by understanding how life colonizes barren and hostile locations, we can better predict how life evolved on Earth and might exist on other planets. Microbial primary succession occurs in a range of natural, host-associated, and engineered environments, which yield unique temporal and spatial contexts for the study of pioneer species (Fernández-Martínez et al., 2017). Glacier forelands, the area of newly exposed land from the leading edge of a retreating glacier, provide a temporal transect (a chronosequence) where the distance from the glacier edge can be used as a proxy for time. Sampling at the glacier edge can provide insight into microbial colonizers of newly exposed terrain, with the progressively older terrain once covered by the glacier harbouring more developed microbial communities and vegetation (Brown & Jumpponen, 2014; Fernández-Martínez et al., 2017; Strauss et al., 2012; Zumsteg et al., 2012). Volcanic lava flows provide opportunities to study microbial primary succession on truly sterile, naturally occurring substrates. Newly erupted lava crystallizes sterile basalt rock at temperatures of around 1150°C, with little or no organic matter, yet contains metals within minerals that may support initial ecosystem establishment, as well as spatial niches within the physical structure of the rock where endolithic communities may assemble. Human-engineered sterile environments, such acid mine drainage formed from newly extracted mining waste impose multiple physicochemical pressures that restrict first colonizers to polyextremophiles (Kupka et al., 2007; Liljeqvist et al., 2015; Wierzchos et al., 2018). Host-associated sterile environments can also provide novel and sometimes medically relevant insights into microbial community development; for example, primary bacterial colonization of the infant human gut results in an oxic environment rapidly becoming anoxic (Palmer et al., 2007), in a manner that varies with mode of delivery and the maternal microbiome (Dominguez-Bello et al., 2010). Microorganisms can even colonize extraterrestrial environments. Meteorites, which are also sterile upon entering the Earth's atmosphere, provide extraterrestrial input of minerals that are far from geochemical equilibrium with the geosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere (Tait et al., 2017). Some meteorites contain an enormous variety of organic molecules (including amino acids in some cases) that formed over 4.6 billion years ago and have never been exposed to terrestrial life (Schmitt-Kopplin et al., 2010). Fractures and porosity in the meteorites, and weathering of the external fusion crust over time, again provide ideal niches for microbial colonization and additionally make meteorites ideal microcosms for simulated studies of primary succession. Micrometeorites are far more abundant than meteorites, but geochemically equivalent, and preferentially accumulate in heavy mineral niches in wind-modified sediments (Tomkins et al., 2016, 2019). Tektites, which are terrestrial ejections of non-porous natural glass following a meteorite impact, provide a different sterile substrate in which biofilm may be the predominant colonization mechanism. Collectively, these environments provide unique opportunities to study first colonizers and their traits in a range of contexts, including comparisons of the various input sources of microbes and nutrients, and the unique physical and chemical characteristics that shape the developing community. Integrated methodological approaches are required to gain a mechanistic understanding of primary succession across these diverse ecosystems. Researchers have obtained some understanding of the identity of the first microbial colonizers, for example through marker gene-based surveys of bacterial, archaeal, and fungal community composition (Zumsteg et al., 2012). However, advances in genome-resolved metagenomics, multi-omics, and high-throughput cultivation mean it is now possible to develop a broader and deeper understanding of the nature, traits, or activities of microorganisms across successional gradients. In turn, these hypothesis-generating tools can be used to inform ecosystem-scale biogeochemical, imaging, and tracing experiments, as well as culture-based physiological and biochemical studies, that will provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of how microorganisms shape their environments and vice versa (Lewis et al., 2021). Landmark examples of integrated methodological approaches include King's studies in the 2000s on succession in volcanic deposits; he combined culture-dependent microbial genomics, culture-independent community and enzyme profiling, bulk geochemical analyses, and botanical surveys to demonstrate that trace gas oxidisers are the early colonizers in volcanic deposits and potentially promote plant development (Gomez-Alvarez et al., 2007; King, 2003; King et al., 2008; King & Weber, 2008). Through integration of cutting-edge culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches, there is now much potential to holistically understand the dynamics of succession and especially how functional traits impact successional trajectories. Each technique is limited in its own capacity, and synergising approaches across different scales facilitates more advanced and comprehensive discoveries (Greening et al., 2019). Mechanistic understanding of the ecological processes shaping microbial colonization in successional ecosystems is minimal. Four processes ultimately determine the composition and function of communities: dispersal, selection, drift, and diversification (Vellend, 2010). Previous work has suggested that the importance of these ecological drivers shifts during successional stages: dispersal dominates during initial stages and selection progressively increases thereafter (Dini-Andreote et al., 2015). Yet with respect to dispersal, the source of dispersing microorganisms remains undetermined. It is assumed that most microbes that colonize terrestrial substrates, for example volcanic lava flows, mine tailings, and glacier forelands, are dispersed from the atmosphere and sometimes via rainwater. However, this remains to be proven in part due to our limited knowledge of the microbial ecology of the atmosphere (Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2022). Likewise, although atmospheric dispersal is often thought to be a strictly neutral (stochastic) process, certain microorganisms are likely better adapted to be transported into and survive within the atmosphere (Šantl-Temkiv et al., 2018). Ultimately, side-by-side profiling of the nature, traits, and activities of microorganisms is required in successional ecosystems compared to the surrounding atmosphere and other potential sources (e.g., glacial ice and sub-glacial soils in glacier forelands). In addition, little is understood about functional traits that dictate whether microorganisms live or die during different successional stages. Strong environmental selection will control initial succession, though this selection can either weaken or strengthen over time depending on whether activities of pioneer microbes generate favourable conditions (e.g., through nitrogen fixation in glacier foreland soils [Strauss et al., 2012]) or unfavourable conditions (e.g., through acidification of mine tailings [Mielke et al., 2003]). Generally, it can be expected that resource competition and other antagonistic interactions will intensify during later successional stages as both microbial community diversity and environmental niche heterogeneity increase, which in turn increasingly favours habitat specialists over generalists. We predict that the first colonizers in terrestrial environments are self-sufficient habitat generalists. These microbes will have a range of adaptation strategies that allow them to colonize barren environments: metabolic strategies to acquire nutrients from atmospheric and mineral sources, dormant forms to withstand resource limitation, homeostatic mechanisms to survive physicochemical stresses, and potentially the capacity to mediate adhesion, weathering, and biofilm formation. Recent findings suggest that in oligotrophic ecosystems, trace gas oxidisers are the strongest candidates for the first colonizers (Mielke et al., 2003; Ortiz et al., 2021). As recently reviewed, these bacteria use trace (including sub-atmospheric) concentrations of hydrogen and carbon monoxide to conserve energy through aerobic respiration and, in some cases, generate biomass through chemosynthetic carbon dioxide fixation (Greening & Grinter, 2022). It is also proposed that metabolic water production by hydrogen oxidisers enhances water availability in desiccated environments (Ortiz et al., 2021). Many of these microbes are also predicted to use the energy derived from trace gas oxidation to acquire other nutrients, including bioavailable nitrogen through nitrogen fixation. Trace gas oxidisers span at least eight different bacterial phyla and are dominant in many extreme environments, including Antarctic desert soils, the aphotic ocean, and acidic mine drainage (Islam et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2017; Martínez-Pérez et al., 2022). Trace gas oxidisers are also reported to occur in successional volcanic soil ecosystems (Gomez-Alvarez et al., 2007; Hernández et al., 2020; King, 2003; King & Weber, 2008). Ultimately, by initially relying on energy sources from the ubiquitous atmosphere rather than less accessible minerals embedded in the colonized substrate, pioneer microbes can maintain viability and generate nutrients relatively independently of the physicochemical restraints of the environments they colonize. Nevertheless, the exact composition and traits of the first colonizers is likely to be modulated by the physical properties, chemical composition, and climatic conditions of the environments colonized. For example, meteorites vary greatly in physicochemical properties, with some being far more reduced than any surface environment on Earth and others being comparatively oxidized and rich in organic compounds. We predict that, whereas meteorites containing only inorganic material will be colonized primarily by gas-scavenging lithoautotrophs that gradually produce organic carbon, carbonaceous chondrites may also initially sustain lithoheterotrophs and organoheterotrophs that rely on extraterrestrial organic compounds (Abdulla, 2009; Tait et al., 2017). It can be expected that, over time, microbial communities will increase in biomass and diversity, and become more abundant, diverse, and specialized as other species are recruited. For example, the synthesis of organic carbon by lithoautotrophic trace gas oxidisers on meteorites may stimulate further microbial growth and biofilm formation. Organic carbon in the form of exudates and necromass are favourable carbon and energy sources for succeeding heterotrophic community members. In addition, biofilm-mediated changes in the surface chemistry or electrochemistry (bioweathering) accelerates the weathering of minerals (Abdulla, 2009; Angell, 1999; Palacios et al., 2019). Such changes may facilitate the succession of more specialist microbes that grow through iron- and sulfide-dependent chemolithoautotrophy. Some metabolically flexible microorganisms may even modulate their energetic strategies during different successional stages; for example, in acid mine drainage, pioneering microorganisms such as Acidithiobacillus may shift from an initial hydrogen-fuelled colonization and acid production towards more specialized iron- and sulfide-based metabolism (Islam et al., 2020; Mielke et al., 2003). In contrast, keystone microbial colonizers in alpine regions or glacier forelands create a more hospitable soil environment, achieved by physically altering the soil texture while chemically transforming major elements into more bioavailable forms (e.g., nitrogen fixation, carbon fixation or the solubilization and mineralization of the soil phosphorus pool) (Richardson & Simpson, 2011). This in turn, can make conditions favourable for the eventual colonization of plant populations, as well as their bacterial and fungal symbionts (Franzetti et al., 2020). A more comprehensive understanding of microbial primary succession has significant implications for our insights into and predictions of how ecosystems initially establish, develop, and are altered by climate change. One important implication for the near future is that rapidly expanding glacier forelands, brought about by widespread glacial retreat, create substantial deglaciated areas in which early ecosystems may carry out different biogeochemical functions than older, established soil ecosystems. In the future, this may impact biogeochemical cycling and global biodiversity on an increasingly broad scale (Stibal et al., 2020). Furthermore, climate and microclimate variation, in addition to topographic, fluvial, or aeolian disturbances, may alter the ability of first colonizer species to inhabit new foreland terrains and may drive a shift in the composition of the early ecosystems (Wojcik et al., 2021). Using knowledge of microbial primary succession, we may better predict patterns of new ecosystem establishment and how this might impact global processes. As primary succession requires microbes to establish a new community under 'bare minimum' conditions, their metabolic processes and survival strategies may give some insights into how life evolved on Earth (abiogenesis) and potentially other planets (exobiology). Indeed, the genesis of life on, or transport to, another planet represents primary succession in an extreme context (Michalski et al., 2018; Tomkins et al., 2020). Our understanding of this process on Earth is likely to inform our conceptualisation of the origin of life elsewhere. For example, it has been suggested that abiotic interactions between iron-containing minerals catalysed the synthesis of organic molecules on the early Earth (White et al., 2015). Furthermore, this research can yield valuable lessons for the biological protection of other planets. Microbial primary colonizers are likely to be highly resilient and adaptable, as they may need to survive atmospheric transport and must establish communities in environments with minimal nutrients: such organisms may be capable of colonizing terrains visited by spacecraft or rovers. For example, halophilic bacteria and archaea may be capable of surviving on Mars by coupling the oxidation of the high concentrations of atmospheric carbon monoxide with the reduction of terrestrial perchlorate (King, 2015). Sterilization procedures may even select for extremophiles that are well suited as primary colonizers (Ghosh et al., 2010). Even terraforming strategies, the practicality and ethics of which have been long debated (McKay et al., 1991), may therefore be informed and potentially mediated by the activities of microbial first colonizers. Much remains uncertain surrounding the functions, metabolic strategies, and impacts of microbial first colonizers in the process of primary succession. Rapid and continuing technological advances in culture-dependent and culture-independent methods provide opportunities to integrate techniques and make significant breakthroughs. This will allow scientists to address long-standing questions surrounding how these organisms survive, how their activities shape their environment to enable colonization by successive organisms, how this varies across different environments, and the original sources of these pioneers. Given most ecological theory of succession developed through studies of plant communities, rather than the earlier microbial pioneers with much broader niche range, there is much potential to test and refine theory. In turn, this may provide clues for how life evolved on Earth and can better inform the search for extraterrestrial life.

Asynarchus larvae predominate in temporary wetlands and are aggressive intraguild predators on Limnephilus larvae, which only predominate in permanent basins with salamanders. We first conducted a field experiment in mesocosms (cattle tanks) to quantify the predatory effects of different life stages of salamanders on the two caddisfly species. Two life stages of the salamanders (larvae and paedomorphs) preferentially preyed on Asynarchus relative to Limnephilus. Subsequent laboratory experiments revealed that high Asynarchus activity rates and relatively ineffective antipredatory behaviors led to higher salamander detection and attack rates compared to Limnephilus. In a second field experiment (full factorial for presence and absence of each of the three species), we found that salamander predation on Asynarchus had an indirect positive effect on Limnephilus: survival was higher in the presence of salamanders + Asynarchus than with just Asynarchus. In the laboratory we compared the predatory effects of salamanders with and without their mouths sewn shut and found the observed indirect positive effect on Limnephilus survival to be mainly the result of reduced numbers of Asynarchus rather than salamander-induced changes in Asynarchus behavior. We argue that indirect effects of predator–predator interactions on shared prey will be mainly density-mediated and not trait-mediated when one of the predators (in this case, Asynarchus) is under strong selection for rapid growth and therefore does not modify foraging behaviors in response to the other predator. The reciprocal dominance of Limnephilus and Asynarchus in habitats with and without salamanders probably reflects a trade-off between competitive superiority and vulnerability to predation. The high activity levels and aggressiveness that enable Asynarchus to complete development in temporary habitats result in strong asymmetric competition (via intraguild predation) with Limnephilus. In permanent habitats these same behaviors increase Asynarchus vulnerability to salamander predation, which indirectly benefits Limnephilus. This and previous work implicate salamanders as keystone predators that exert a major influence on the composition of benthic and planktonic assemblages in subalpine wetlands.",https://openalex.org/W2008976596,2cd76c19c7b9f9783efb8239b9c38f350bf8dbbb,0,True,0.9868465662002563,0
https://doi.org/10.1071/bt07150,Plant trait - environmental linkages among contrasting landscapes and climate regimes in temperate eucalypt woodlands,"Ecological sorting of species along climate and landscape gradients is a fundamental global pattern. However, the extent to which functional traits reflect floristic turnover in response to interactions between climate and landscape gradients is rarely assessed. We tested whether floristic variation among sites within a bioregion was more strongly correlated with soil fertility or climate. We then examined the relationship between floristic composition, environment and the co-variation of selected vegetative and regenerative functional traits. This allowed us to assess the ecological sorting of species along soil fertility and rainfall gradients and to detect any resource compensation effects via interactions between these factors. Floristic differences were equally associated with soil fertility and climate contrasts but species’ trait patterns were more strongly associated with soil fertility than rainfall. No interactive effects, which would suggest resource compensation, were detected. Instead, more fertile sites consistently had more forbs, annuals and grasses in comparison with less fertile sites which were dominated by woody species and had a higher abundance of graminoids. Three broad mechanisms for sorting of species based on trait patterns are proposed (1) differences in the fundamental regenerative and growth niche, (2) resource competition during establishment and (3) disturbance-mediated sorting.",https://openalex.org/W2161049907,80384dd5dda3fe66a3debb6d2b9f447c2df701b4,0,True,0.9896279573440552,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.14042,Diet quality and conspecific larval density predict functional trait variation and performance in a polyphagous frugivorous fly,"Abstract Diet quality and the presence and abundance of conspecifics feeding on the same food resource are critical factors that affect functional traits of many animal species and influence ecological processes. We hypothesized that in insects whose larvae live in groups of varying sizes in ephemeral and nutritionally variable environments, extreme macronutrient content in the feeding substrate is a barrier for optimal performance that can be overcome by the collective feeding behaviour of large numbers of larvae. We experimentally examined how multiple immature and adult traits of the polyphagous tephritid fruit fly, Anastrepha ludens, vary as a function of the quality of its larval diet (protein + carbohydrate [P + C] content of 8.0%–12.6% w/w, and protein‐to‐carbohydrate [P/C] ratio of 1.8–0.11) across extreme levels of conspecific larval densities (60–600 larvae/60 g of diet). Overall, we found positive effects on survival of immature and adult stages, the duration of the larval stage, pupal weight and adult emergence of flies, as dietary P + C content increased, followed by negative effects when the diet had extremely high carbohydrate‐biased macronutrient content. Larval density had positive, negative and curvilinear effects depending on the macronutrient composition of the food, resulting in a range of fly responses through a continuous scale of macronutrient content and larval density combinations. Optimal performance of A. ludens, in terms of larval development time, body weight and survival to adulthood, was found when the diet consisted of low P + C content and high P/C ratios, and low larval densities. Our findings point to a diet‐mediated relationship between density and survival to the adult stage, suggesting that large numbers (up to a point) of larvae can balance negative effects of conspecific competition when food is characterised by high macronutrient content and low P/C ratios. We conclude that diet quality and conspecific density interact in complex ways to shape trait expression and performance in a frugivorous fly. Addressing this interaction is key to advance the understanding of the mechanisms behind changes in population dynamics in insect species living in groups confined in isolated and ephemeral resources.

https://doi.org/10.1890/10-2071.1,The community effects of phenotypic and genetic variation within a predator population,"Natural populations are heterogeneous mixtures of individuals differing in physiology, morphology, and behavior. Despite the ubiquity of phenotypic variation within natural populations, its effects on the dynamics of ecological communities are not well understood. Here, we use a quantitative genetics framework to examine how phenotypic variation in a predator affects the outcome of apparent competition between its two prey species. Classical apparent competition theory predicts that prey have reciprocally negative effects on each other. The addition of phenotypic trait variation in predation can marginalize these negative effects, mediate coexistence, or generate positive indirect effects between the prey species. Long-term coexistence or facilitation, however, can be preceded by long transients of extinction risk whenever the heritability of phenotypic variation is low. Greater heritability can circumvent these ecological transients but also can generate oscillatory and chaotic dynamics. These dramatic changes in ecological outcomes, in the sign of indirect effects, and in stability suggest that studies which ignore intraspecific trait variation may reach fundamentally incorrect conclusions regarding ecological dynamics.",https://openalex.org/W2107810237,c97369ad632340b7be5762d93d6cb836d2055670,0,True,0.9612467885017395,0

Understanding the environmental context and species traits that give rise to these divergent outcomes is a major challenge to the generality of both theoretical and applied ecology. In aquatic systems, nutrient-mediated eutrophication has led to major declines in species diversity, motivating us to seek terrestrial analogues using a large-mammal system across 598 000 km 2 of the Canadian boreal forest. These forests are undergoing some of the most rapid rates of land-use change on Earth and are home to declining caribou ( Rangifer tarandus caribou ) populations. Using satellite-derived estimates of primary productivity, coupled with estimates of moose ( Alces alces ) and wolf ( Canis lupus ) abundance, we used path analyses to discriminate among hypotheses explaining how habitat alteration can affect caribou population growth. Hypotheses included food limitation, resource dominance by moose over caribou, and apparent competition with predators shared between moose and caribou. Results support apparent competition and yield estimates of wolf densities (1.8 individuals 1000 km −2 ) above which caribou populations decline. Our multi-trophic analysis provides insight into the cascading effects of habitat alteration from forest cutting that destabilize terrestrial predator–prey dynamics. Finally, the path analysis highlights why conservation actions directed at the proximate cause of caribou decline have been more successful in the near term than those directed further along the trophic chain.",https://openalex.org/W3122952408,2eb292d5549e1aa6b1a5d59e71a8d5fda358326a,0,True,0.96736079454422,0

Predation, for example, can be stronger at lower latitudes, while competition can intensify at later stages of assembly due to resource limitation. Since biotic filters act upon functional traits of organisms, we explored trait-mediated community assembly in diverse marine assemblages from four regions along the Pacific coast of North and Central America. Using predator exclusion experiments and two assembly stages, we tested the hypotheses that non-random trait patterns would emerge during late assembly at all regions due to competition and at lower latitude regions regardless of assembly stage due to predation. As expected, trait divergence occurred in late assembly but only at higher latitude regions, while in tropical Panama, relaxed predation caused trait divergence during late assembly. Moreover, colonizing trait strategies were common during early assembly while competitive strategies were favoured during late assembly at higher latitude regions. Predation-resistant traits were only favoured in Panama during both assembly stages. Our large-scale manipulative study demonstrates that different biotic interactions across time and latitude can have important consequences for trait assembly.",https://openalex.org/W4313279032,0b1b88cdf20ca66859eec1b9d8f8b08138980548,0,True,0.9765257835388184,0
https://doi.org/10.1890/07-1131.1,REVISITING THE CLASSICS: CONSIDERING NONCONSUMPTIVE EFFECTS IN TEXTBOOK EXAMPLES OF PREDATOR–PREY INTERACTIONS,"Predator effects on prey dynamics are conventionally studied by measuring changes in prey abundance attributed to consumption by predators. We revisit four classic examples of predator-prey systems often cited in textbooks and incorporate subsequent studies of nonconsumptive effects of predators (NCE), defined as changes in prey traits (e.g., behavior, growth, development) measured on an ecological time scale. Our review revealed that NCE were integral to explaining lynx-hare population dynamics in boreal forests, cascading effects of top predators in Wisconsin lakes, and cascading effects of killer whales and sea otters on kelp forests in nearshore marine habitats. The relative roles of consumption and NCE of wolves on moose and consequent indirect effects on plant communities of Isle Royale depended on climate oscillations. Nonconsumptive effects have not been explicitly tested to explain the link between planktonic alewives and the size structure of the zooplankton, nor have they been invoked to attribute keystone predator status in intertidal communities or elsewhere. We argue that both consumption and intimidation contribute to the total effects of keystone predators, and that characteristics of keystone consumers may differ from those of predators having predominantly NCE. Nonconsumptive effects are often considered as an afterthought to explain observations inconsistent with consumption-based theory. Consequently, NCE with the same sign as consumptive effects may be overlooked, even though they can affect the magnitude, rate, or scale of a prey response to predation and can have important management or conservation implications. Nonconsumptive effects may underlie other classic paradigms in ecology, such as delayed density dependence and predator-mediated prey coexistence. Revisiting classic studies enriches our understanding of predator-prey dynamics and provides compelling rationale for ramping up efforts to consider how NCE affect traditional predator-prey models based on consumption, and to compare the relative magnitude of consumptive and NCE of predators.",https://openalex.org/W2166153649,71cb2c58a3df1fc445f7ebfe9b6e5b750e3f2982,0,True,0.961578369140625,0
https://doi.org/10.1086/303415,Character Shifts of Prey Species That Share Predators,"This article uses several models to explore the potential indirect evolutionary interaction between two prey species that share one or more predator species. It asks how the antipredator adaptations of a focal prey species are likely to evolve following the introduction of a second prey species that shares one or more of the same predator species. The interactions are represented by differential equation models of homogeneous populations, and evolutionary change occurs in a single quantitative trait within each prey species. Models differ in assumptions about the number of predator types, the costs of antipredator traits, and in how predator and prey traits combine to determine a per capita capture rate. Parallel change in the antipredator characteristics of two species usually occurs when the general risk of predation is changed by the introduction of the second prey. This may be a parallel increase or decrease, depending on whether the ecological interaction is apparent competition or apparent mutualism. Divergence in trait values is most often associated with the presence of two or more distinct types of predators with some form of trade‐off in the prey's ability to avoid different predators. Divergence may also occur with a single predator type, when two or more strategies exist for reducing predation risk. Convergence is a possible outcome when there are two or more predator types.

Where it has been examined, the effects of overfishing have cascaded down the food chain. In an intensively fished area on the western Scotian Shelf, Northwest Atlantic, the biomass of prey species increased exponentially (doubling time of 11 years) even though the aggregate biomass of their predators remained stable over 38 years. Concomitant reductions in herbivorous zooplankton and increases in phytoplankton were also evident. This anomalous trophic pattern led us to examine how declines in predator body size (approx. 60% in body mass since the early 1970s) and climatic regime influenced lower trophic levels. The increase in prey biomass was associated primarily with declines in predator body size and secondarily to an increase in stratification. Sea surface temperature and predator biomass had no influence. A regression model explained 65 per cent of prey biomass variability. Trait-mediated effects, namely a reduction in predator size, resulted in a weakening of top predation pressure. Increased stratification may have enhanced growing conditions for prey fish. Size-selective harvesting under changing climatic conditions initiated a trophic restructuring of the food chain, the effects of which may have influenced three trophic levels.",https://openalex.org/W2133966170,121e66e0f589660036867734020980a794e84f2f,0,True,0.9926695227622986,0

Theory predicts that divergence arises because natural selection favors individuals that are phenotypically dissimilar from their competitors. Yet, there are few conclusive tests of this key prediction. Drawing on data from both natural populations and a controlled experiment, this paper presents such a test in tadpoles of two species of spadefoot toads (Spea bombifrons and S. multiplicata). These two species show exaggerated divergence in trophic morphology where they are found together (mixed-species ponds) but not where each is found alone (pure-species ponds), suggesting that they have undergone ecological character displacement. Moreover, in pure-species ponds, both species exhibit resource polymorphism. Using body size as a proxy for fitness, we found that in pure-species ponds disruptive selection favors extreme trophic phenotypes in both species, suggesting that intraspecific competition for food promotes resource polymorphism. In mixed-species ponds, by contrast, we found that trophic morphology was subject to stabilizing selection in S. multiplicata and directional selection in S. bombifrons. A controlled experiment revealed that the more similar an S. multiplicata was to its S. bombifrons tankmate in resource use, the worse was its performance. These results indicate that S. multiplicata individuals that differ from S. bombifrons would be selectively favored in competition. Our data therefore demonstrate how resource competition between phenotypically similar individuals can drive divergence between them. Moreover, our results indicate that how competition contributes to such divergence may be influenced not only by the degree to which competitors overlap in resource use, but also by the abundance and quality of resources. Finally, our finding that competitively mediated disruptive selection may promote resource polymorphism has potentially important implications for understanding how populations evolve in response to heterospecific competitors. In particular, once a population evolves resource polymorphism, it may be more prone to undergo ecological character displacement.",https://openalex.org/W1957116440,c82b91d57a5400c2b29b5bef8fbb6cece1ca4ed5,0,True,0.9886295199394226,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jeb.13684,Direct and indirect selection on mate choice during pollen competition: Effects of male and female sexual traits on offspring performance following two‐donor crosses,"Mate choice in plants is poorly understood, in particular its indirect genetic benefits, but also the direct benefits of avoiding harmful matings. In the herb Collinsia heterophylla, delayed stigma receptivity has been suggested to enhance pollen competition, potentially functioning as a female mate choice trait. Previous studies show that this trait can mitigate the cost of early fertilization caused by pollen, thus providing a direct benefit. We performed two-donor pollinations during successive floral stages to assess how this stigma receptivity trait and two pollen traits known to affect siring success influence indirect benefits in terms of offspring performance. We also investigated differential resource allocation by studying the influence of sibling performance in the same capsule. Offspring performance in terms of flower number was mainly affected by parental identities and differential resource allocation. Offspring seed production showed some influence of resource allocation, but was also affected by pollen donor identity and varied positively with late stigma receptivity. However, the effect of late stigma receptivity on offspring seed production was weakened in matings with pollen that advanced stigma receptivity. In conclusion, delayed stigma receptivity may be selected through both direct and indirect fitness effects in C. heterophylla, where pollen-based delay on stigma receptivity might act as a cue for mate choice. However, selection may also be counteracted by antagonistic selection on pollen to advance stigma receptivity. Our results highlight the challenges of studying indirect genetic benefits and other factors that influence mate choice in plants.",https://openalex.org/W3046049304,fe6009bb0e888334387fe0554bebc1d3858a5a60,0,True,0.9178414344787598,0

In this study, we coupled field observations with experiments to ask if the degree of character displacement reflects the intensity of competition between two closely related spadefoot toads (Spea bombifrons and S. multiplicata). Tadpoles of both species develop into either a small-headed omnivorous morph, which feeds mostly on detritus, or a large-headed carnivorous morph, which specializes on and whose phenotype is induced by fairy shrimp. Previously, we found that S. multiplicata are inferior competitors for fairy shrimp and are less likely to develop into carnivores in sympatry with S. bombifrons. We compared four key trophic characters in S. multiplicata across natural ponds where the frequency of S. bombifrons varied. We found that S. multiplicata became increasingly more omnivore-like as the relative abundance of S. bombifrons increased. Moreover, in controlled laboratory populations, S. multiplicata became increasingly more omnivore-like and S. bombifrons became increasingly more carnivore-like as we increased the relative abundance of the other species. Phenotypic plasticity helped mediate this divergence: S. multiplicata became increasingly less likely to eat shrimp and develop into carnivores in the presence of S. bombifrons, a superior predator on shrimp. However, divergence also reflected differences in canalized traits: When reared under common conditions, S. multiplicata tadpoles became increasingly less likely to produce carnivores as their natal pond decreased in elevation. Presumably, this pattern reflected selection against carnivores in lower-elevation ponds, because S. bombifrons became increasingly more common with decreasing elevation. Local genetic adaptation to the presence of S. bombifrons was remarkably fine grained, with differences in carnivore production detected between populations a few kilometers apart. Our results suggest that the degree of character displacement potentially reflects the intensity of competition between interacting species and that both phenotypic plasticity and fine-scale genetic differentiation can mediate this response. Moreover, these results provide causal evidence linking resource competition to species divergence.",https://openalex.org/W2173311449,1f54495702a69ebc60021b0e20f84648fb98356e,0,True,0.9810291528701782,0

In many systems, the fear of being eaten causes trait-mediated cascades whose strength can rival or exceed that of more widely recognized density-mediated cascades transmitted by predators that consume their prey. Despite this progress it is only beginning to be understood how the influence of predation risk is shaped by environmental context and whether it can exert an important influence on ecosystem-level processes. This study used a factorial mesocosm experiment that manipulated basal-resource identity (either barnacles, Semibalanus balanoides, or mussels, Mytilus edulis) to determine how resources modify the influence of predation risk, cascade strength, and the efficiency of energy transfer in two, tritrophic, rocky-shore food chains containing the predatory green crab (Carcinus maenas) and an intermediate consumer (the snail, Nucella lapillus). The effect of predation risk and the strength of trait-mediated cascades (both in absolute and relative terms) were much stronger in the barnacle than in the mussel food chain. Moreover, predation risk strongly diminished the efficiency of energy transfer in the barnacle food chain but had no significant effect in the mussel food chain. The influence of resource identity on indirect-effect strength and energy transfer was likely caused by differences in how each resource shapes the degree of risk perceived by prey. We suggest that our understanding of the connection between trophic dynamics and ecosystem functioning will improve considerably once the effects of predation risk on individual behavior and physiology are considered.",https://openalex.org/W1974807310,b34186101454f4a9f943ff138761fa93df4b0830,0,True,0.9268249869346619,0

Thus, bird nestlings are highly dependent on antibodies received from their mother (in the eggs) during their rapid early growth period. The relationship between maternal immunity and the development of neonates’ own immunity has been poorly studied. It has been suggested that immune function plays an important part in mediating resource competition between different life‐history traits, e.g. growth and reproduction. Maternal investment of antibodies has potentially permanent effects on offspring phenotype. Thus, the trade‐offs between the immune function and other important life‐history traits in the offspring will also affect the fitness of the mother. Our supplemental feeding experiment in the magpie Pica pica indicates that the immunoglobulin levels of offspring at hatching are dependent on a mother's nutritional condition. In addition, the amount of maternal immunoglobulins transferred to offspring increases along the laying order within a nest. We also found that at the age of 8–10 days the immunoglobulin production of the offspring has already begun. Furthermore, the maternal immunoglobulin levels of the offspring at hatching were positively related to their immunoglobulin levels on day 10. Maternal immunoglobulins did not significantly affect offspring growth, but there was a negative relationship between self‐produced immunoglobulins and growth over the first 10 days, indicating a trade‐off between these traits. Nestlings’ weight, however, had a positive relationship with immunoglobulin production suggesting that the observed trade‐off between growth and immunoglobulin production is due to catch‐up growth of nestlings with a low hatching weight. We found that within nests nestlings with higher maternal antibody levels had higher survival rate until day 20, but between nests there was an opposite relationship. Evidently, there is a trade‐off, in magpies, between maternal resources, immune function and growth, shaping the evolution of maternal investment in offspring immunity.",https://openalex.org/W1747288921,1b64e5f306ebe5398c72c295a6463b065848eaeb,0,True,0.9184644818305969,0

Such fitness costs impact in the ecology and evolutionary trajectory of resistant populations. 2 Neighbourhood experiments were performed to quantify competitive effects and responses between herbicide-susceptible (S) and resistant (R) Lolium rigidum individuals in which resistance is due to enhanced herbicide metabolism mediated by cytochrome P450. 3 In two-way competitive interactions between the S and R phenotypes, individuals of the S phenotype were the stronger effect competitors on both a per capita and per unit-size basis. The S phenotype also exhibited a stronger competitive response to wheat plants than did the R phenotype, displaying significantly greater (30%) above-ground biomass at the vegetative stage. When subjected to competition from wheat, R individuals produced significantly fewer reproductive tillers and allocated fewer resources to reproductive traits than individuals of the S phenotype. 4 The role of potential mechanisms underlying this resistance cost driven by traits such as plant size and tolerance to low resource availability, as well as the evolutionary implications of the results are discussed. 5 Synthesis. Evolved herbicide resistance due to enhanced-herbicide metabolism mediated by cytochrome-P450 in L. rigidum has been shown to be accompanied with an impaired ability to compete for resources.

We performed a whole-lake experiment by stocking a non-native top predator (pikeperch (Sander lucioperca)) to two residential piscivores (Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) and northern pike (Esox lucius)). By analyzing spatial distribution, diet composition, growth, and consumption rates of the piscivores before and after pikeperch introduction, we tested how both density-dependent and trait-mediated responses affected interactions between the three predators. Total piscivore biomass increased 1.5 times and annual consumption by the piscivores increased 1.7 times after stocking, attributable to the stocked pikeperch and increased northern pike abundances. Abundance, distribution, and consumption data indicated that northern pike was hardly affected by pikeperch stocking and even increased its biomass, whereas piscivorous perch shifted its habitat use towards the littoral lake areas in response to competition with pikeperch. Furthermore, all piscivores increasingly fed on small perch. The forced habitat shift of piscivorous perch in combination with increased predation on small perch led to a decreased abundance of large perch, attributable to the compensatory effects of intraguild predation and cannibalism.",https://openalex.org/W2104930916,cafbc3653b6d538b4063a31a27db55dc59ae117d,0,True,0.9945521354675293,0

Aggregation among heterospecific individuals may require particular during‐life traits, for example, traits limiting competition for space or resources. But is aggregation also facilitated by after‐life traits accelerating decomposition of plant litters, notably through synergy among co‐decomposing litters? We investigated the role of leaf traits, litter traits and litter‐mixture decomposition in the spatial aggregation of individuals of pairs of grassland species in a long‐term mesocosm experiment. We related aggregation between pairs of species to mean and dissimilarity in (a) during‐life traits related to resource‐acquisition and clonal dispersal, (b) after‐life traits related to decomposition and (c) rate and synergy of decomposition. In most years, aggregation of heterospecific individuals strongly increased with means of (a) during‐life clonal traits reducing competition for space, and (b) after‐life traits increasing litter decomposition. Trait dissimilarities had comparatively less influence. Interestingly, in the last year, synergistic decomposition among litters improved species aggregation. Overall, after‐life interactions due to fast and synergistic decomposition appear to increase during‐life aggregation between individuals of different plant species. We introduce the concept of ‘associational decomposition’, equivalent to associational resistance, but mediated via decomposers rather than enemies.

https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2014.1952,Prey state shapes the effects of temporal variation in predation risk,"The ecological impacts of predation risk are influenced by how prey allocate foraging effort across periods of safety and danger. Foraging decisions depend on current danger, but also on the larger temporal, spatial or energetic context in which prey manage their risks of predation and starvation. Using a rocky intertidal food chain, we examined the responses of starved and fed prey (Nucella lapillus dogwhelks) to different temporal patterns of risk from predatory crabs (Carcinus maenas). Prey foraging activity declined during periods of danger, but as dangerous periods became longer, prey state altered the magnitude of risk effects on prey foraging and growth, with likely consequences for community structure (trait-mediated indirect effects on basal resources, Mytilus edulis mussels), prey fitness and trophic energy transfer. Because risk is inherently variable over time and space, our results suggest that non-consumptive predator effects may be most pronounced in productive systems where prey can build energy reserves during periods of safety and then burn these reserves as 'trophic heat' during extended periods of danger. Understanding the interaction between behavioural (energy gain) and physiological (energy use) responses to risk may illuminate the context dependency of trait-mediated trophic cascades and help explain variation in food chain length.",https://openalex.org/W2032709850,b5883fc8648fce5ae845ed0ed71bc888c6ae367a,0,True,0.990456223487854,0

Trait‐mediated interactions between predator and prey result from non‐consumptive predator effects changing behavioural and/or life history traits of prey. However, in biological control the occurrence of trait‐mediated interactions between predators, prey and plants has been largely ignored. Here, we show that non‐consumptive predator effects on prey cascade down to the plant in an agro‐ecological food chain. The study system consisted of the predatory mites P. persimilis and N. californicus, the herbivorous non‐target prey western flower thrips F. occidentalis and the host plant bean. Irrespective of predator species and risk posed to prey, the presence of predator eggs led to increased ambulation, increased mortality and decreased oviposition of thrips. Furthermore, the presence of predator eggs reduced leaf damage caused by thrips.

Multiple‐strain infections lead to intraspecific interactions and may have important ecological and evolutionary effects on both hosts and parasites. However, experimental evidence on intraspecific competition or facilitation in infections has been scarce because of the technical challenges of distinguishing and tracking individual co‐infecting strains. To overcome this limitation, we engineered transgenic strains of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, the causal agent of human African sleeping sickness. Different strains were transfected with fluorescence genes of different colors to make them visually distinguishable in order to investigate the effects of multiple‐strain infections on parasite population dynamics and host fitness. We infected mice either with each strain alone or with mixes of two strains. Our results show a strong mutual competitive suppression of co‐infecting T. brucei strains very early in infection. This mutual suppression changes within‐host parasite dynamics and alleviates the effects of infection on the host. The strength of suppression depends on the density of the co‐infecting strain, and differences in life‐history traits between the strains determine the consequences of strain–strain competition for the host. Unexpectedly, co‐infection with a less virulent strain significantly enhances host survival (+15%). Analysis of the strain dynamics reveals that this is due to the suppression of the density of the more virulent strain (−33%), whose degree of impact ultimately determines the physical condition of the host. The competitive suppression is likely caused by allelopathic interference or by apparent competition mediated by strain‐specific immune responses. These findings highlight the importance of intraspecific variation for parasite−parasite and parasite−host interactions. To fully understand parasite and disease dynamics, the genetic diversity of infections must be taken into account. Through changes in parasite dynamics, intraspecific variation may further affect transmission dynamics and select for increased virulence of each strain. The precise mechanisms underlying mutual suppression are not yet understood but may be exploitable to fight this devastating parasite. Our results are therefore not only of basic ecological interest investigating an important form of intraspecific competition, but may also have applied relevance for public health.",https://openalex.org/W2142726382,0fb66e1c3cc37adffa140cd2a936b637e99c79ec,0,True,0.9529981017112732,0

Here we tested the effects of biotic and abiotic factors, on the morphology of two contrasting Muridae species (Chinese white-bellied rats Niviventer confucianus [n = 565; 57.1 g] and Edwards's long-tailed giant rats Leopoldamys edwardsi [n = 45; 459.5 g]) in relation to Bergmann's, Allen's, Hesse's and Geist's eco-geographical rules along a 2900-m elevational gradient. Specifically, we tested the ""body size threshold"" theory, which posits that animals heavier than 0.16 kg are more likely to follow Bergmann's rule. We measured body length and mass, appendage lengths and heart mass for 610 adult specimens from 115 localities, and used principal components analysis to quantify food resource availability. Linear mixed models were employed to test these eco-geographical rules, along with the effects of associated biotic and abiotic factors. We found that for N. confucianus (< 0.16 kg), colder temperatures were associated with smaller body-size, contrary to Bergmann's rule, and with greater interspecific competition and food abundance (supporting Geist's rule). There was no support for Allen's rule, except for a contrary effect on snout length among females; however, greater intraspecific competition and lesser food abundance were associated with shorter snout length, supporting Geist's rule. Heart size increased with colder temperatures, but only among females, partly supporting Hesse's rule, and decreased with greater intraspecific competition for both sexes. L. edwardsi (> 0.16 kg) did not conform with any eco-geographic rules, and so we found no support for the ""body size threshold"" theory. Our study proposes that food resource abundance and inter- and intraspecific competition mediated variations in morphological traits in these rodent species to a greater extent than any reduction in temperature alone, giving little support for ecogeographical rule effects. We interpret that where food supply can meet energetic demands, even under colder conditions, then any selective pressure for thermal/energy efficiency through larger body size and shorter appendages will be alleviated.

Predation is a well-known driver of community diversity and composition, yet the role of functionally diverse predator communities in filtering prey community traits has received less attention. We examined functionally diverse communities of predators (fishes) and prey (epifaunal crustaceans) in eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds in two northern California estuaries to evaluate the filtering effects of predator traits on community assembly and how filters acting on predators influence their ability to mediate prey community assembly. Fish traits related to bottom orientation were correlated with more clustered epifauna communities, and epifauna were generally overdispersed while fishes were clustered, suggesting prey may be pushed to disparate areas of trait space to avoid capture by benthic sit-and-wait predators. We also found correlations between the trait dispersions of predator and prey communities that strengthened after accounting for the effects of habitat filters on predator dispersion, suggesting that habitat filtering effects on predator species pools may hinder their ability to affect prey community assembly. Our results present compelling observational evidence that specific predator traits have measurable impacts on the community assembly of prey, inviting experimental tests of predator trait means on community assembly and explicit comparisons of how the relative effects of habitat filters and intraguild competition on predators impact their ability to affect prey community assembly.

Yet, little is known about the proximate mechanisms that mediate such rapid evolutionary transitions. Here, we investigated the role of diet-induced, cryptic genetic variation in facilitating the evolution of novel resource-use traits that are associated with a new feeding strategy—carnivory—in tadpoles of spadefoot toads (genus Spea ). We specifically asked whether such variation in trophic morphology and fitness is present in Scaphiopus couchii, a species that serves as a proxy for ancestral Spea. We also asked whether corticosterone, a vertebrate hormone produced in response to environmental signals, mediates the expression of this variation. Specifically, we compared broad-sense heritabilities of tadpoles fed different diets or treated with exogenous corticosterone, and found that novel diets can expose cryptic genetic variation to selection, and that diet-induced hormones may play a role in revealing this variation. Our results therefore suggest that cryptic genetic variation may have enabled the evolutionary transition to carnivory in Spea tadpoles, and that such variation might generally facilitate rapid evolutionary transitions to novel diets.",https://openalex.org/W2115499015,e5d09fbcfaccc17f33b0bf50333d7f7badb6f2b0,0,True,0.9657473564147949,0

Although it has been proposed that taxonomic diversity and functional traits mediate this relationship, how several facets of community structure affect the delivery of key ecosystem services remains to be explored. In this study, we investigated how abundance, taxonomic richness as well as the shape of biomass distribution in predator communities affect biological pest control services in vineyard landscapes. Our analyses were based on a dataset combining samples of arthropod predators, measures of predation rates of grape pests and characterization of environmental covariables for 42 fields located in South‐Western France. We found that beside the abundance or the taxonomic richness of predators, the shape of biomass distribution (mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis of the distribution) influences the level of biological control. Predator communities largely dominated by low biomass species provided the bulk of biological control services. Lower levels of predation resulted from increased proportions of large biomass species and more evenly distributed biomass values in the communities. Our results indicate that the top‐down control provided by low biomass species decreases as the relative proportion of large biomass species increases in the predator community. This suggests that biological control may be affected by negative interactions (e.g. intraguild predation, behavioural interactions) between predators arising from the recruitment of large individuals in the community. Our study revealed that the shape of biomass distribution is a major aspect of functional diversity in predator communities providing insights into the mechanisms that link biodiversity and ecosystem services. While our study focuses on biomass, considering other traits involved in trophic interactions may increase our ability to predict the level of biological control in ecosystems.

Here, we present adaptive dynamics, a powerful tool of evolutionary invasion analysis that explores how quantitative traits undergo incremental evolution, to exploring the emergence of multi‐species networks through coevolution. Specifically, we exemplify the feasibility of using adaptive dynamics to investigate trait evolution in 4 ecological networks, driven, respectively, by resource competition, trophic interactions, as well as bipartite mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. We use a set of ordinary differential equations to describe, at different paces, the population dynamics and trait dynamics of involved species assemblages. Through computing ecological equilibrium, invasion fitness, selection gradient and evolutionary singularity, and testing for evolutionary stability and the coexistence criterion of mutual invasibility, we illustrate the typical evolutionary dynamics and the criteria of evolutionary stability and branching in these ecological networks. Results highlight the importance of the form of trait‐mediated interaction kernel (ie, interaction strength as a function of trait difference) to adaptive diversification in these coevolutionary systems.

Resource availability is a particularly dynamic and potent environmental driver of within‐host infection dynamics (temporal patterns of growth, reproduction, parasite production and survival). We developed, parameterised and validated a model for resource‐explicit infection dynamics by incorporating a parasitism module into dynamic energy budget theory. The model mechanistically explained the dynamic multivariate responses of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni and its intermediate host snail to variation in resources and host density. At the population level, feedbacks mediated by resource competition could create a unimodal relationship between snail density and human risk of exposure to schistosomes. Consequently, weak snail control could backfire if reductions in snail density release remaining hosts from resource competition. If resource competition is strong and relevant to schistosome production in nature, it could inform control strategies.",https://openalex.org/W2793588632,26b3209ee5d397c426ab238a824088614e1f3de5,0,True,0.9142988324165344,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/rra.3396,"The three Rs of river ecosystem resilience: Resources, recruitment, and refugia","Abstract Resilience in river ecosystems requires that organisms must persist in the face of highly dynamic hydrological and geomorphological variations. Disturbance events such as floods and droughts are postulated to shape life history traits that support resilience, but river management and conservation would benefit from greater understanding of the emergent effects in communities of river organisms. We unify current knowledge of taxonomic‐, phylogenetic‐, and trait‐based aspects of river communities that might aid the identification and quantification of resilience mechanisms. Temporal variations in river productivity, physical connectivity, and environmental heterogeneity resulting from floods and droughts are highlighted as key characteristics that promote resilience in these dynamic ecosystems. Three community‐wide mechanisms that underlie resilience are (a) partitioning (competition/facilitation) of dynamically varying resources, (b) dispersal, recolonization, and recruitment promoted by connectivity, and (c) functional redundancy in communities promoted by resource heterogeneity and refugia. Along with taxonomic and phylogenetic identity, biological traits related to feeding specialization, dispersal ability, and habitat specialization mediate organism responses to disturbance. Measures of these factors might also enable assessment of the relative contributions of different mechanisms to community resilience. Interactions between abiotic drivers and biotic aspects of resource use, dispersal, and persistence have clear implications for river conservation and management. To support these management needs, we propose a set of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and life‐history trait metrics that might be used to measure resilience mechanisms. By identifying such indicators, our proposed framework can enable targeted management strategies to adapt river ecosystems to global change.",https://openalex.org/W2913341700,4822418811e2256da5a898f5748a5eab7583bb2b,0,True,0.9806590676307678,0

By using long-term data on tree growth and survival for coexisting Inga (Fabaceae, Mimosoideae) congeners, we tested two mechanisms thought to underlie negative density dependence (NDD): competition for resources and attack by herbivores. We quantified the similarity of neighbors in terms of key ecological traits that mediate these interactions, as well as the similarity of herbivore communities. We show that phytochemical similarity and shared herbivore communities are associated with decreased growth and survival at the sapling stage, a key bottleneck in the life cycle of tropical trees. None of the traits associated with resource acquisition affect plant performance, indicating that competition between neighbors may not shape local tree diversity. These results suggest that herbivore pressure is the primary mechanism driving NDD at the sapling stage.",https://openalex.org/W2921121381,7798c03cafa9bfbb11500d17b9682d26f2a55558,0,True,0.9858313798904419,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.13244,Leaf trait variation in grassland plant species in response to soil phosphorus,"Abstract Questions Increased soil phosphorus (P) availability in fertilized grasslands can drive both community degradation and delayed community recovery upon agricultural abandonment. Beyond describing grassland community patterns along gradients in P availability, it remains unclear how individual species with different strategies respond to increasing phosphorus. Here we studied intraspecific variability of leaf functional traits in response to soil phosphorus, for species with contrasting resource‐use strategies. Methods We set up a pot experiment with communities containing four species, assembled from a pool of 20 mesotrophic grassland species growing along a soil P gradient. Species selection included various growth forms (grasses vs forbs) and resource‐use strategies (acquisitive vs conservative resource use). We measured three variables characterizing the (a)biotic environmental context: bioavailable soil P concentration, total community biomass as a proxy for the intensity of competition, and the proportional biomass of a species in the community as a proxy for its competitive dominance. We investigated the effect of this environmental context on the expression of two leaf traits, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC). Results We found an acquisitive trait expression within species (increase in SLA and decrease in LDMC) in response to increased soil P supply and a conservative trait expression (decrease in SLA and increase in LDMC) in response to an increase in total community biomass. Importantly, the trait responses to the environmental context were generally consistent for species representing very different resource‐use strategies and growth forms. Conclusions Species responded with a shift from an acquisitive to a conservative trait expression in response to limited resources; i.e., driven by a decrease in soil phosphorus concentration or an increase in total community biomass. Unexpectedly, the intraspecific variability in response to the changing environmental conditions was not clearly mediated by the species’ strategy. These findings show that plant ecological strategies are probably not the main driver for intraspecific trait variability in an experimental grassland community.",https://openalex.org/W4392653617,d8e3c0d5c7ba1d8dbdc4cb2115efe8911b506679,0,True,0.9723681807518005,0

We studied top-down effects of (sub-) adult wolf spiders (Lycosidae) on arthropods in a meadow. We compared risk effects with the overall top-down effect (including consumption) by gluing the chelicers of wolf spiders to prevent them from killing the prey. In a field experiment, we created three treatments that included either: (i) intact ('predation') wolf spiders; (ii) wolf spiders with glued chelicers ('risk spiders'); or (iii) no (sub-) adult wolf spiders. Young wolf spiders were reduced by their (sub-) adult congeners. Densities of sheetweb spiders (Linyphiidae), a known intraguild prey of wolf spiders, were equally reduced by the presence of risk and predation wolf spiders. Plant- and leafhoppers (Auchenorrhyncha) showed the inverse pattern of higher densities in the presence of both risk and predation wolf spiders. We conclude that (sub-) adult wolf spiders acted as top predators, which reduced densities of intermediate predators and thereby enhanced herbivores. Complementary to earlier studies that found trait-mediated herbivore suppression, our results demonstrate that herbivores can be enhanced through cascading risk effects by top predators.",https://openalex.org/W2117138466,d20253a490674f9dbe28e023d5bccb723ceaaa8d,0,True,0.9911733865737915,0

Condition-specific competition, wherein competitive superiority varies with the abiotic environmental gradient, has been proposed as the major structuring force behind such distributions. However, few studies have elucidated the underlying mechanisms, such as behavioral and demographic processes. We conducted laboratory experiments to examine the effects of temperature on interspecific competition between two stream salmonid fishes, Salvelinus malma and S. leucomaenis. The two species have a largely allopatric altitudinal distribution on Hokkaido Island, Japan, proposed to be the result of temperature-mediated competition. We tested predictions that at a higher temperature (12°C), S. leucomaenis would dominate over S. malma in aggressive interactions, foraging performance, growth, and survival, but become subordinate at a lower temperature (6°C). Indeed, S. leucomaenis initiated a greater number of aggressive acts, attained greater food intake and greater growth, and finally excluded S. malma at the higher temperature. Although the two species initiated a similar number of aggressive acts and foraged equally well at the lower temperature, S. leucomaenis achieved a higher growth rate than S. malma; however, the latter eventually became numerically dominant. Clear competitive release in allopatry occurred for S. malma only at the higher temperature, providing direct evidence of condition-specific asymmetric competition. The lower distribution boundary of S. malma in Hokkaido streams may therefore be determined by temperature-mediated condition-specific competition. However, mechanisms determining the upper distribution boundary of S. leucomaenis could not be fully explained by the competitive results at lower temperature, but required an understanding of how effects of competition interacted with species-specific physiological traits. Thus, species distributions along an environmental gradient cannot be solely explained by a simple model of condition-specific competition without considering mechanistic linkages among behavioral and physiological responses to the environment, resource use, and demographic processes.",https://openalex.org/W2072147251,209bb24d4917978a92c1d3e36821899959b33359,0,True,0.9298284649848938,0

While such emergent predator effects are ubiquitous in natural communities, the strength of these effects varies among studies and systems, making it difficult to predict a priory how changes in predator diversity influence prey suppression. Thus, identifying general scaling rules which can explain this variation of non-independent effects is vital for modelling natural communities and how they respond to biodiversity loss. Body size is a key trait determining the nature and strength of ecological interactions. While great progress has been made using allometric relationships to predict the interaction strength of predator-prey pairs, it is unknown whether similar relationships explain variation in the strength of NCEs, and how they are related to consumptive effects. Here, we experimentally manipulate the relative size difference of multiple predators to determine whether NCEs follow general allometric scaling relationships in an aquatic multi-predator system. Results demonstrate that the presence and strength of NCEs can vary dramatically across predator combinations. However, this variation scaled predictably with the size ratio of predators, increasing the size difference among predators increased NCEs. This pattern was driven by a size-mediated shift in 'food web motif' from competition to intraguild predation and a positive correlation of NCEs and intraguild predation rate. Results indicate that models which assume that consumers have independent effects are particularly likely to make erroneous predictions when predators differ substantially in size, but simple allometric relationships of NCEs could be used to correct this bias.",https://openalex.org/W2146516835,a207b919d66154f7a5546db1bd6370d830cb4e21,0,True,0.9906715750694275,0

Mutualisms, particularly, are known to influence species' population dynamics and their invasive ability (e.g., mycorrhizal fungi with partner plants). Yet, while modeling coinvasion, their role in mediating coexistence is overlooked. Here, we build a spatially explicit model of coinvasion of two competing plant species with a shared fungal mutualist to study how mutualism and competition interact to shape the local and regional coexistence of competitors. We observe four main results. First, mutualist presence generates regional coexistence between competitors even when local coexistence between them is impossible. Second, increasing partner mutualist dispersal leads to abrupt changes in competitor coexistence outcomes. Third, differences in mutualist partner dependence and competitive ability interact to produce a variety of local and regional coexistence outcomes. Fourth, asymmetry in the dispersal ability arising from dependence‐dispersal trade‐offs leads to greater exclusion of species less dependent on mutualist partners for growth. In toto, incorporating mutualism‐specific trait trade‐offs and dispersal asymmetries into coinvasion models offers new insights into regional coexistence and invasive species distributions.",https://openalex.org/W4407908292,f14b0dd3d54eded3b876083986fa574080bdb6e9,0,True,0.9372382760047913,0

Recent findings suggest that epigenetic modifications are important mediators of such plasticity. However, empirical studies have, so far, mainly focused on plasticity in response to abiotic factors, overlooking the response to competition. We tested for within‐generation and transgenerational phenotypic plasticity triggered by plant–plant competition intensity, and we tested whether it was mediated via DNA methylation, using the perennial, apomictic herb Taraxacum brevicorniculatum in four coordinated experiments. We then tested the consequences of transgenerational plasticity affecting competitive interactions of the offspring and ecosystem processes, such as decomposition. We found that, by promoting differences in DNA methylation, offspring of plants under stronger competition developed faster and presented more resource‐conservative phenotypes. Further, these adjustments associated with less degradable leaves, which have the potential to reduce nutrient turnover and might, in turn, favour plants with more conservative traits. Greater parental competition enhanced competitive abilities of the offspring, by triggering adaptive phenotypic plasticity, and decreased offspring leaf decomposability. Our results suggest that competition‐induced transgenerational effects could promote rapid adaptations and species coexistence and feed back on biodiversity assembly and nutrient cycling.",https://openalex.org/W3094948797,880647bcc951344f5d6d6ae7beb830838e0aff06,0,True,0.9479575157165527,0

Patch structures have been interpreted as a result of the prevalence of facilitation phenomena in highly stressful environments. Several mechanisms have been proposed in order to explain the factors that control the existence of these clumped structures. However, they have not been evaluated in these mountains. Our hypothesis is that patchy structure in high mountain Mediterranean vegetation is a consequence of facilitative and competitive interactions in a very harsh environment which ultimately involve strong localized effects on soil properties. Our results show that levels of soil nutrients were higher under vegetation patches than in bare ground areas, confirming the hypothesis of an amelioration of soil resources under canopies. Pairwise associations and repulsions suggest the existence of two contrasting composition stages. Contrasting models relating patch species composition (cover and biomass) and soil resources indicated a weak relationship between species features and soil nutrient levels. Finally, structural modeling showed that patch size has a relevant but indirect effect on soil resource levels through grass and total biomass. We conclude that patch structure and dynamics in high Mediterranean mountain communities may be partly controlled by an endogenous process involving facilitation and competition for soil key resources. These interactions may operate through some community traits related to patch size but not to composition.",https://openalex.org/W2173071604,cd7dcbeb1ecfd106fb91a2824ca3b9641df450ca,0,True,0.9641591906547546,0
https://doi.org/10.1086/695832,Evolution as a Coexistence Mechanism: Does Genetic Architecture Matter?,"Species sharing a prey or a predator species may go extinct due to exploitative or apparent competition. We examine whether evolution of the shared species acts as a coexistence mechanism and to what extent the answer depends on the genetic architecture underlying trait evolution. In our models of exploitative and apparent competition, the shared species evolves its defense or prey use. Evolving species are either haploid or diploid. A single locus pleiotropically determines prey nutritional quality and predator attack rates. When pleiotropy is sufficiently antagonistic (e.g. nutritional prey are harder to capture), eco-evolutionary assembly culminates in one of two stable states supporting only two species. When pleiotropy is weakly antagonistic or synergistic, assembly is intransitive: species-genotype pairs are cyclically displaced by rare invasions of the missing genotypes or species. This intransitivity allows for coexistence if, along its equilibria, the geometric mean of recovery rates exceeds the geometric mean of loss rates of the rare genotypes or species. By affecting these rates, synergistic pleiotropy can mediate coexistence, while antagonistic pleiotropy does not. For diploid populations experiencing weak antagonistic pleiotropy, superadditive allelic contributions to fitness can mitigate coexistence via an eco-evolutionary storage effect. Density-dependence and mutations also promote coexistence. These results highlight how the efficacy of evolution as a coexistence mechanism may depend on the underlying genetic architecture.",https://openalex.org/W2521695164,b9ef356e5fe5842de69d18e06939c4cb89d90d47,0,True,0.9847310185432434,0

While plant competition for light has received considerable attention, the facilitative effect that shading can have on plants and the role of species‐specific adaptations in mediating this phenomenon are still poorly understood. Evidence is accumulating, however, that positive interactions can play as important a role in community structuring as has been shown for competition. 2. We examined interspecific variation in growth responses to shade using 46 temperate grassland species grown for 10 weeks in a common garden under identical soil conditions but at different levels of shading. The importance of morphological plasticity and habitat preference as species traits determining the net effect of shading on plant growth was tested. 3. Moderate shade (50% daylight) had, on average, a net facilitative effect on plant mass. Plant growth in the 25% daylight treatment was not significantly different from that in full daylight, and it was only when 90% of natural light was made unavailable that shaded plants attained a significantly lower dry mass than plants in full daylight. 4. Species that exhibited the most pronounced reduction in specific leaf area and increased allocation to roots in full compared with 50% daylight were least facilitated by shading. This finding supports the hypothesis that morphological plasticity is an important trait determining the strength of facilitative interactions. 5. The growth response to shade was also dependent on species’ ecological optima, with species characteristic of nutrient‐poor or dry habitats most facilitated by shade. Greater growth enhancement by shade in grassland stress‐tolerant plants is surprising because such species frequently occupy unproductive vegetation with little shade and should therefore be adapted to high irradiance. This result calls into question the notion that a positive effect of shade on growth always reflects stress amelioration. 6. Synthesis. Our study demonstrates a widespread ability of plant species to decouple growth from resource availability and challenges our understanding of the processes determining plant productivity.",https://openalex.org/W1566296928,0aba22aca3745f21b449501d5fface568b4818fe,0,True,0.9037984013557434,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.1536,Chemical similarity and local community assembly in the species rich tropical genus <i>Piper</i>,"Community ecologists have strived to find mechanisms that mediate the assembly of natural communities. Recent evidence suggests that natural enemies could play an important role in the assembly of hyper-diverse tropical plant systems. Classic ecological theory predicts that in order for coexistence to occur, species differences must be maximized across biologically important niche dimensions. For plant-herbivore interactions, it has been recently suggested that, within a particular community, plant species that maximize the difference in chemical defense profiles compared to neighboring taxa will have a relative competitive advantage. Here we tested the hypothesis that plant chemical diversity can affect local community composition in the hyper-diverse genus Piper at a lowland wet forest location in Costa Rica. We first characterized the chemical composition of 27 of the most locally abundant species of Piper. We then tested whether species with different chemical compositions were more likely to coexist. Finally, we assessed the degree to which Piper phylogenetic relationships are related to differences in secondary chemical composition and community assembly. We found that, on average, co-occurring species were more likely to differ in chemical composition than expected by chance. Contrary to expectations, there was no phylogenetic signal for overall secondary chemical composition. In addition we found that species in local communities were, on average, more phylogenetically closely related than expected by chance, suggesting that functional traits other than those measured here also influence local assembly. We propose that selection by herbivores for divergent chemistries between closely related species facilitates the coexistence of a high diversity of congeneric taxa via apparent competition.",https://openalex.org/W2478088704,941d0eae0f2d7257e4d3c8189b3e9698d445b0c1,0,True,0.9942384362220764,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2009.01673.x,Adaptive foragers and community ecology: linking individuals to communities and ecosystems,"Thirteen years ago, the journal Evolutionary Ecology ran a special issue commemorating 30 years of the influence of foraging theory on population and community ecology (Schmitz 1997). This era began with the classic foraging theories of MacArthur & Pianka (1966), Emlen (1966)Fretwell & Lucas (1969), and Charnov (1976a,b), and was followed by the seminal contributions of Pyke, Pulliam & Charnov (1977), Schoener (1971, 1973, 1976, 1983, 1987), Belovsky (1978) and Stephens & Krebs (1986). These contributions are noteworthy for their emphasis on making predictions about diet choice, habitat selection and territory size, as well as the degree of consumer specialization and generalism. Subsequently, a bout of empirical and theoretical work reinforced the notion that foraging behaviour, and more generally adaptive behaviour, is critical to understanding the structure of ecological communities and the dynamics of the populations within them (Schoener 1971, 1973, 1976, 1983, 1986, 1987, 1989; Holt 1983; Belovsky 1986a,b; Fryxell & Lundberg 1994). It is now well established that animals adaptively choose their diets, shift their habitat use and alter their morphology in response to temporal and spatial variation in resource availability, as well as the presence of predators and parasites. Optimal foraging remains the central theory linking resource and consumer traits to patterns of resource selection. Yet, even after 40 years of development, there are precious few advances towards truly synthesizing the connections between individuals, populations and large interconnected food webs (Schoener 1989; Schmitz 1997; Abrams 2008). Nevertheless, we suggest that food web biology will emerge in the next 10 years as a new focal point for understanding the interplay between adaptive behaviour, population dynamics and the complexity and structure of ecosystems. Food webs, the networks of feeding links between species, are central to our understanding of ecosystem structure, stability and function. Studies of food webs have informed us on issues ranging from how the loss of species may initiate cascades of extinctions to the types of structural regularities that may promote population and community stability. Moreover, the use of foraging rules and optimization in various large-scale models of food web structure and dynamics is growing again (Williams & Martinez 2000; Kondoh 2003, 2006, 2007; Loeuille & Loreau 2005; Beckerman, Petchey & Warren 2006; Brose, Williams & Martinez 2006b; Brose et al. 2006a; Loeuille et al. 2007; Petchey et al. 2008), perhaps inspired by the contributions in Evolutionary Ecology 13 years ago (Schmitz 1997). Despite this optimism, the typical empirical food web analysis today still falls into one of two categories, each with its own limitations. The first, the static category, aims to answer questions such as who eats whom, how many trophic links are there, and what are the patterns of trophic links? The second, the dynamics category, aims to address questions such as what happens when one species eats another species and, more generally, what are the effects of particular patterns of trophic interactions on population dynamics, stability and community structure (e.g. Gross et al. 2009). This static/dynamic dichotomy remains the norm and has contributed many insights into the structure and dynamics of real communities. However, through this Special Feature, we hope to reinforce that foraging behaviours, and the associated, broadly defined set of individual traits that make up behaviours of individuals, represent one of the most fundamental links between the static and dynamic approaches. To begin, we provide a general framework that draws together – and provides motivating conceptual links between – individual traits, adaptive behaviour, food-web structure, population dynamics, and community stability. Our rationale for proposing that adaptive foraging (traits/behaviour) and food webs must be linked is that foraging traits form the interface between selection pressures and population dynamics (Fig. 1). There is no linear way to present the dynamic feedback between biotic selection pressures on particular organisms, the traits of those organisms, the ensuing dynamics of both the traits and the populations, and the consequences for the complexity and structure of a community or ecosystem. Figure 1 does, however, present the key concept that phenotypes are both subject to natural selection and determine patterns of consumption, population growth and population dynamics. Food web properties rely on and are influenced by individual and species-specific traits. Traits are the phenotype that both undergo natural selection and underpin patterns of consumption, population growth and population dynamics. We highlight here a research programme that is enhancing links between selection, individuals' traits and community structure, that sits at the confluence of ecological and evolutionary research. Resources ultimately drive patterns of physiology, morphology, behaviour, and life history, and thus generate strong and weak interactions among competitors and predators (Fig. 1, middle). Consumers generate comparable changes in prey/resource behaviour, morphology and life history that further affect interactions among the prey, competitors, and their own natural enemies (Fig. 1, middle). Here, we classify these changes in physiology, morphology, behaviour, and life history under the general concept of adaptive behaviour, where behaviour can be defined at multiple scales. These changes in resource and consumer traits simultaneously alter the pattern of who eats whom and the dynamics that result from the interactions (Fig. 1, middle to right). Evolution, driven via selection pressures, changes these traits. Yet is important to realize that the interactions per se and the dynamics that result from them are selection pressures (Fig. 1, left and right to middle). This simplified illustration of different levels of ecological organization (individual fitness, adaptively defined traits, species interactions, and community structure) underscores how and why traits related to foraging and eating are central to our understanding of food webs. Figure 2 expands this perspective to highlight various groups of traits that have played and continue to play an important role in food-web research. The left-hand column emphasizes the need for a broad definition of adaptive behaviour across three hierarchical scales – individuals, populations and small community modules and up to entire food-web networks and ecosystems. The techniques, theories and models for assessing the role of traits have been varied. Most techniques centre around integrating various concepts from optimal foraging theory, while some have leveraged generic optimization methods to explore the evolutionary ecology implications of embedding traits directly in dynamic models (e.g.Ives & Dobson 1987). A perspective on groups of traits that have and continue to play an important role in food-web research. The performance of individuals, the dynamics of populations, the structure of networks, and the dynamics of ecosystems are influenced by these various traits and the focus of large bodies of theoretical and empirical research. The research we highlight here suggests that enhancing this link between traits, theory and small and large networks will be very productive at providing a mechanistic explanation of stability, complexity and ecosystem structure. Perhaps most importantly, a few common channels of creativity are recognizable in the figure. Body size continues to feature heavily throughout research at different scales. It is represented even more often when one considers allometry as a specific focus on the ecological implications of body size (Schoener 1989; Cohen et al. 1993; Belovsky 1997; Jennings & Warr 2003; Berlow et al. 2004; Emmerson & Raffaelli 2004; Loeuille & Loreau 2005; Brose et al. 2006a; Petchey et al. 2008). Body size is further implicated in understanding the role of growth and ontogeny (e.g. life history) and in creating temporal, spatial and morphological refuges (e.g. species interaction traits) (Werner & Hall 1977; Sih 1982b, 1987; Werner 1992; Werner & Anholt 1993; Anholt & Werner 1995). These examples complement classical representations of habitat selection as a behaviour (Emlen 1966; MacArthur & Pianka 1966). Recent advances in understanding information quality and detection has stimulated productive lines of research into perception, signalling and learning as traits potentially influencing interactions and dynamics. However, all but a handful of this research stops at the foraging, habitat-selection and/or mate-choice scale, and does not extend to population dynamics and larger food webs. For example, there is a growing interest in how different types of information are accumulated (Valone 2006) and how this information affects habitat selection and the expression of defensive traits (Alonzo 2002; Luttbeg 2002; Stamps & Davis 2006; Turner, Turner & Lappi 2006). Further examples include the role and quality of alarm signals with respect to predation (Beauchamp & Ruxton 2007; Rowland et al. 2008; Chittka, Skorupski & Raine 2009; Higginson & Ruxton 2009). A notable exception is work by Luttbeg, which extends questions about information quality to dynamics games of more than two species (Luttbeg & Schmitz 2000; Luttbeg, Rowe & Mangel 2003). As Sih, Hanser & McHugh (2009) indicate in their recent perspective on linking social network theory to behavioural ecology, the links between network science, behavioural ecology and food webs can only grow. Interaction strengths, once a source of major debate (and perhaps still so, see Paine 1992; Laska & Wootton 1998; Abrams 2001a; Berlow et al. 2004) have emerged as a cornerstone of defining and measuring dynamics incorporating both species identity and more importantly, species traits (Paine 1992; Wootton 1997; Berlow et al. 1999, 2004; Ings et al. 2009). There is a long history of including various species traits in models of competition and predation (and disease), frequently inspired and motivated by optimal foraging theory (Schoener 1973, 1976; Sih 1981, 1982a; Holt 1983; Schoener 1983, 1986; Abrams 1987a, b; Schoener 1987, 1989; Sih 1987; Fryxell & Lundberg 1993, 1994). And not at all disconnected from this is the current challenge of partitioning direct and indirect effects, of varying strength, in food webs of varying size, to the categories of density or trait-mediated indirect effect (Schmitz, Beckerman & O'Brien 1997; Schmitz 1998; Peacor & Werner 2001; Schmitz, Krivan & Ovadia 2004; Bolnick & Preisser 2005; Preisser, Bolnick & Benard 2005; Abrams 2008). However, the large-scale food-web research programme has not embraced traits in the same way that research on smaller communities has. It should be no surprise to many people that, historically, the majority of this trait-inspired research on food webs and populations dynamics has been restricted to simple interactions between individuals within a single species or among fewer than four species, i.e. in small networks (see also Ives & Dobson 1987; Abrams 1996; Abrams & Matsuda 1996; Abrams 2000; Kokko & Ruxton 2000; Abrams 2001b). With a few exceptions, the focus of this research has been on understanding the role of traits in the stability and persistence of these small communities (but see Kondoh 2003; Loeuille & Loreau 2005). Even the briefest look at Fig. 2 confirms that only a handful of specific traits have been linked to large network/food-web questions (see below), despite the more general consideration of traits in small-scale food webs. One of the most encouraging patterns in the past 5 years is that two of the newest aspects of food web biology – binary-network analysis and the large-scale evolutionary–dynamic analysis – are increasingly making use of one of the oldest motivating theories in behavioural, population and community ecology: that of adaptive behaviour/optimal foraging. The cascade model (Cohen & Newman 1985), the niche model (Williams & Martinez 2000) and subsequent alterations of the niche model (Cattin et al. 2004) use probabilistic rules to encode established empirical and theoretical rules about foraging. The dynamic and evolutionary models of Kondoh (2003, 2006) and Loeuille and Loreau (2005) use simple rules of energy gain to add adaptive trait dynamics to explorations of stability and complexity in large communities. Our own work (Beckerman, Petchey & Warren 2006; Petchey et al. 2008) uses the contingency model of optimal foraging and allometry to predict both the complexity and structure of observed food webs. Where to now? With all of this history, do we really need a new vision? We think so. 1, 2 illustrate that a great deal of effort has been made to integrate traits into what we consider small-scale food webs. We advocate three over-arching objectives for the future. First, we must better synthesize and begin to capture generalities from across trait types among the small network studies (see Abrams 2009; Stouffer 2009). Second, we must further extend the use of traits and theories successful at providing insight at the small scale to the larger, network-size food webs (see Brose 2009; Kondoh 2009; Loeuille 2009 and Stouffer 2009). Finally, we must also recognize the opportunity to link advances from small-scale dynamics involving traits to the larger networks, understanding that the small, tractable communities are what network biologists know as modules or motifs in the larger networks (see Stouffer 2009). In essence, we expect that the details from the work at small scales will provide node-specific and biologically relevant information to advance the current phenomenological focus of networks (Proulx, Promislow & Phillips 2005; Bianconi, Pin & Marsili 2009; Sih, Hanser & McHugh 2009). There are currently precious few examples of these efforts. This Special Feature contains five papers that together support a vision for the future of food-web research centred on adaptive behaviour. They are authored by people who might be considered grand masters of the field as well as people just entering academia. Importantly, they provide perspective and insight while stimulating thought about the use and importance of traits across various scales. It is this emphasis that we champion and we hope it will lead towards a synthetic definition of food-web biology in which traits, dynamics and structure are linked together. The feature begins with a remarkable and notable piece of work by Peter Abrams (2009), who for the first time provides a review of his contribution to understanding the stability, dynamics and contingency of simple models of a few species. One of the core features of Abrams' work over the past decades has been a reliance on what we all consider to be simple models and always clear assumptions. His attempts to include traits associated with foraging and trade-offs in the models have continued to develop our understanding of how traits matter a great deal and how dynamics, persistence and stability are contingent upon model assumptions. His overview provides insight into five over-arching themes and questions that drive all of his research. The article by Nicolas Loeuille (Loeuille 2009) provides another overview, this time from the perspective of large-scale population dynamics. Loeuille's research with Michel Loreau is a fundamental contribution to understanding how evolution of foraging traits and constraint on species' diets can shape the complexity, structure and dynamics of food webs (see also Kondoh 2003). His more recent forays into metacommunity ecology maintain the focus at a large scale, and his paper here helps draw together methods and insights that come from defining traits among many species at these large scales. The works by Uli Brose (Brose 2009) and by Michio Kondoh (Kondoh 2009) bring us directly to one of the most common traits used in food-web biology: size. Brose reviews the increasing body of empirical evidence about the allometry of foraging traits, such as handling times, maximum ingestion rates and attack rates, while highlighting some of the gaps. For example, there is relatively little information about how the shape of a consumer's functional response (Type I, Type II, Type III, or somewhere in amongst these) is influenced by the size of prey and predator. Despite the need for more and better empirical information (as always!), Brose reviews models of how individual foraging behaviour, expressed both in prey to predator mass ratios and the distribution of trophic interactions, can resolve one of the longest standing puzzles in ecology: how very diverse and complex ecosystem can be dynamically stable. Although overall body size is of great importance for foraging behaviour, considerable variation around allometric relationships indicates the potential for other traits to have strong effects. Michio Kondoh presents an analysis investigating how cognitive capacity and the ability and rate at which organisms can adapt behaviourally (e.g. learning) can influence the relationship between predator and prey. In particular, Kondoh's contribution documents an intriguing relationship that suggest predator–prey pairs (i.e. diet choice) are determined not only by overall organismal size, but also on relative brain sizes. While the underlying causes of these relationships remain open to speculation, he proposes that arms races in the cognitive ability of prey and predator are a possibility. Such arms races have the potential to strongly influence population dynamics and community structure. Finally, the work of Daniel Stouffer (Stouffer 2009) offers a critical review of many of the phenomenological and population-level models of food webs, with an eye towards asking two fundamental questions: do we need the population-level models and, if we do, do the small sets and patterns (motifs) of interactions among species (e.g. Abrams 2009) offer sufficient insight into patterns at the large scale captured more often by phenomenological models. Stouffer's own research on motifs in food webs offers an intriguing link between small and large food-web networks, and this question of scale is critical to future empirical research and attempts to manage natural resources and communities. This collection of papers aims to build on the exciting recent progress in food-web biology by integrating research in behavioural ecology, allometry, population ecology and community ecology. The authors explore the extent to which the structure and dynamics of populations and communities can be understood by including aspects of individual behaviour. The papers report on foraging decisions, cognitive ability and body size in models of and experiments at small and large scales, across a breadth of different systems, and by observational, experimental and theoretical approaches. The papers will hopefully acquaint ecologists with the current state of knowledge regarding scaling adaptive behaviour to community and ecosystem patterns and motivate the next decade of research linking behaviour to food webs. The articles in this special feature arise from a Special Symposium at the 92nd Annual Meeting of the Ecological Society of America in San Jose CA.

https://doi.org/10.3732/ajb.1300064,Water‐use efficiency and relative growth rate mediate competitive interactions in Sonoran Desert winter annual plants,"• Premise of the study: A functional approach to investigating competitive interactions can provide a mechanistic understanding of processes driving population dynamics, community assembly, and the maintenance of biodiversity. In Sonoran Desert annual plants, a trade‐off between relative growth rate (RGR) and water‐use efficiency (WUE) contributes to species differences in population dynamics that promote long‐term coexistence. Traits underlying this trade‐off explain variation in demographic responses to precipitation as well as life history and phenological patterns. Here, we ask how these traits mediate competitive interactions. • Methods: We conducted competition trials for three species occupying different positions along the RGR–WUE trade‐off axis and compared the effects of competition at high and low soil moisture. We compared competitive effect (ability to suppress neighbors) and competitive response (ability to withstand competition from neighbors) among species. • Key results: The RGR–WUE trade‐off predicted shifts in competitive responses at different soil moistures. The high‐RGR species was more resistant to competition in high water conditions, while the opposite was true for the high‐WUE species. The intermediate RGR species tended to have the strongest impact on all neighbors, so competitive effects did not scale directly with differences in RGR and WUE among competitors. • Conclusions: Our results reveal mechanisms underlying long‐term variation in fitness: high‐RGR species perform better in years with large, frequent rain events and can better withstand competition under wetter conditions. The opposite is true for high‐WUE species. Such resource‐dependent responses strongly influence community dynamics and can promote coexistence in variable environments.",https://openalex.org/W2065818477,87629046a20f382fa457569382ca6fe419a1045b,0,True,0.952149510383606,0

We investigated the role of specificity, relative virulence and relative dose in determining the competitive outcome of multiple infections in the Daphnia magna-Pasteuria ramosa host-parasite system. We found that infections by P. ramosa clones (single genotype) were less virulent and produced more spores than infections by P. ramosa isolates (possibly containing multiple genotypes). We also found that two similarly virulent isolates of P. ramosa differed considerably in their within-host competitiveness and their effects on host offspring production when faced with coinfecting P. ramosa isolates and clones. Although the relative virulence of a P. ramosa isolate/clone appears to be a good indicator of its competitiveness during multiple infections, the relative dose may alter the competitive outcome. Moreover, spore counts on day 20 post-infection indicate that the competitive outcome is largely decided early in the parasite’s growth phase, possibly mediated by direct interference or apparent competition. Our results emphasize the importance of epidemiology as well as of various parasite traits in determining the outcome of within-host competition. Incorporating realistic epidemiological and ecological conditions when testing theoretical models of multiple infections, as well as using a wider range of host and parasite genotypes, will enable us to better understand the course of virulence evolution.",https://openalex.org/W1978931157,5c92e6bccd050b8c2f54433ec2e967c7aa729006,0,True,0.9423215985298157,0
https://doi.org/10.1890/06-1095.1,"TRITROPHIC EFFECTS OF BIRDS AND ANTS ON A CANOPY FOOD WEB, TREE GROWTH, AND PHYTOCHEMISTRY","Insectivorous birds and ants co-occur in most terrestrial communities, and theory predicts that emergent properties (i.e., nonadditive effects) can determine their combined influence on arthropods and plants. In a three-year factorial experiment, I investigated whether the effects of birds on pine and its arthropods differed based on the presence of ants that were predators of most arthropods, but mutualists with tended aphid species. Birds and ants reduced the abundance of most herbivorous and carnivorous arthropods in an additive fashion, with the effects of ants being stronger than those of birds. In sharp contrast, the opposing influences of birds and ants on tended aphid species interacted strongly; ants only increased tended aphid abundance in the absence of birds, while birds only reduced their abundance in the presence of ants. This interaction was mirrored in total herbivore abundance because tended aphids dominated the herbivore community. I develop a novel lexicon to discuss the emergent properties from these effects of opposing sign (predation, mutualism). Despite having emergent effects on herbivores, birds indirectly increased pine wood and foliage growth to a similar extent whether or not ants were present, while ants had no detectable effects. Birds also indirectly increased the abundance of some pine phloem monoterpenes, but these effects differed based on the presence or absence of ants. Thus, I report on a novel yet possibly widespread indirect interaction between intraguild predators, herbivore mutualists, and plant traits (growth, secondary chemistry) mediated through a species-rich community of arthropods.",https://openalex.org/W2146078060,d8484d6053cb93c401bf5ef5fd36b0b5e1f75333,0,True,0.9571544528007507,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.12010,"Linking ecological niche, community ecology and biogeography: insights from a mechanistic niche model","Abstract Aim We present a mechanistic niche model that integrates the demography of competing plant species in a metabolic, stochastic framework. In order to explore the model's ability to generate multiple species and community patterns, we assessed trait composition, richness gradients and spatial distributions of species ranges and abundances of simulated communities. Location Hypothetical, sloped plane. Methods Stage‐structured populations of species differing in traits and habitat requirements competed for space in a grid‐based model. Demographic processes (recruitment, reproduction, mortality, dispersal) and resource competition were explicitly simulated. Demographic rates and carrying capacity followed metabolic constraints. We simulated 50 species pools until reaching stable communities. Species pools were initialized with 400 species that had random traits and habitat requirements. The habitat requirements generated potential distributions of richness, range and abundance, whereas the simulations yielded realized distributions. Results The communities assembled in the simulations consisted of species spread non‐randomly within trait space. Potential species richness peaked at mid‐elevations, whereas realized richness was slightly shifted towards higher elevations. For 11% of all species, the highest local abundances were found not in the most suitable habitat, but in suboptimal conditions. 53% of all species could not fill the climatically determined potential range. The ability to fill the potential range was significantly influenced by species traits (e.g. body mass and Allee effects) and species richness. Main conclusions Spatial and trait properties of surviving species and of equilibrium communities diverged from the potential distributions. Realized richness gradients were consistent both with patterns observed in nature and those expected from null models based on geometrical constraints. However, the divergences between potential and realized patterns of richness, ranges and abundances indicate the importance of demography and biotic interaction for generating patterns at species and community levels. Consequently, bias in correlative habitat models and single‐species mechanistic models may arise if competition and demography are neglected. Additionally, competitive exclusion provides a mechanistic explanation for the low transferability of single‐species niche models. These results confirm the usefulness of mechanistic niche models for guiding further research integrating ecological niche, community ecology and biogeography.",https://openalex.org/W2105322043,120618092fe72099145179876a569be63ffdcb48,0,True,0.955646812915802,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.03458,The negative effects of pathogen‐infected prey on predators: a meta‐analysis,"Intra‐guild predation (IGP) – where a top predator (IG Pred ) consumes both a basal resource and a competitor for that resource (IG Prey ) – has become a fundamental part of understanding species interactions and community dynamics. IGP communities composed of intraguild predators and prey have been well studied; however, we know less about IGP communities composed of predators, pathogens, and resources. Resource quality plays an important role in community dynamics and may influence IGP dynamics as well. We conducted a meta‐analysis on predator–pathogen–resource communities to determine whether resource quality mediated by the pathogen affected predator life‐history traits and if these effects met the theoretical constraints of IGP communities. To do this, we summarized results from studies that investigated the use of predators and pathogens to control insect pests. In these systems, the predators are the IG Pred and pathogens are the IG Prey. We found that consumer longevity, fecundity, and survival decreased by 26%, 31% and 13% respectively, when predators consumed pathogen‐infected prey, making the infected prey a low quality resource. Predators also significantly preferred healthy prey over infected prey. When we divided consumers by enemy type, strict predators (e.g. wolf spiders) had no preference while parasitoids preferred healthy prey. Our results suggest that communities containing parasitoids and pathogens may rarely exhibit intraguild predation; whereas, communities composed of strict predators and pathogens are more likely dominated by IGP dynamics. In these latter communities, the consumption of low and high quality resources suggests that IGP communities composed of strict predators, pathogens and prey should naturally persist, supporting IGP theory. Synthesis We investigated how consuming pathogen‐infected prey influence important life‐history parameters of insect predators. Pathogens are used in a variety of biocontrol programs, especially to control crop pests. We found that true predators (i.e. wolf spiders) have no preference for healthy or infected prey and have reduced fecundity, survival and longevity consuming infected prey. However, parasitoids avoided infected prey when possible. In biocontrol programs with multiple control agents, parasitoids and pathogens would do a better job controlling pests as predators would reduce the amount of pathogen available and have reduced fitness from consuming infected prey. However, theory suggests that true predators, prey and pathogens may coexist long term.",https://openalex.org/W2322152281,75286b8caf7eec39b4cfc00030511ebdf084300d,0,True,0.9610962867736816,0
https://doi.org/10.1890/07-0659.1,GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION IN RESOURCE DOMINANCE–DISCOVERY IN BRAZILIAN ANT COMMUNITIES,"A predictive framework for the ecology of species invasions requires that we learn what limits successful invaders in their native range. The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) is invasive in the United States, Puerto Rico, Australia, New Zealand, and China. Solenopsis invicta appears to be a superior competitor in its introduced range, where it can cause the local extirpation of native species, but little is known about its competitive ability in its native range in South America. Here we examine the competitive ability of S. invicta for food resources in three widely separated Brazilian ant communities. Each of these communities contains 20-40 ant species, 8-10 of which were common and frequently interacted with S. invicta. S. invicta at all three sites was attacked by several species-specific phorid parasitoids, and at one site, two other species were attacked by their own specialized parasitoids. We examined interactions in these local communities for evidence that trade-offs among ant species between resource dominance and resource discovery, and between resource dominance and parasitoid vulnerability facilitate local coexistence. The trade-off between resource dominance and resource discovery was strong and significant only at Santa Genebra, where parasitoids had no effect on the outcome of confrontations at resources. At Bonito, parasitoids significantly reduced the ability of S. invicta, which was the top-ranked behavioral dominant, from defending and usurping food resources from subordinate species. In the Pantanal, S. invicta ranked behind three other ant species in a linear hierarchy of behavioral dominance, and lost the majority of its interactions with a fourth more subordinate species, Paratrechina fulva, another invasive species. Parasitoids of S. invicta were uncommon in the Pantanal, and did not affect its low position in the hierarchy relative to the other two sites. Parasitoids, however, did affect the ability of Linepithema angulatum, the top-ranked behavioral dominant in this community, from defending and usurping resources from behavioral subordinates. These results indicate that both interspecific competition and trait-mediated indirect effects of phorid parasitoids affect the ecological success of the red imported fire ant in its native range, but that the relative importance of these factors varies geographically.",https://openalex.org/W2106362457,2109beac1cc60e4fcf44de53f76d9a6dddba501d,0,True,0.993934154510498,0

Here, we offer an alternative framework where virulent immune‐provoking behaviours and enhanced immune resistance are joint tactics of invading pathogens to eliminate resident competitors (transferring resources from resident to invading pathogen). The pathogen wins by creating a novel immunological challenge to which it is already adapted. We analyse a general ecological model of ‘proactive invasion’ where invaders not adapted to a local environment can succeed by changing it to one where they are better adapted than residents. However, the two‐trait nature of the ‘proactive’ strategy (provocation of, and adaptation to environmental change) presents an evolutionary conundrum, as neither trait alone is favoured in a homogenous host population. We show that this conundrum can be resolved by allowing for host heterogeneity. We relate our model to emerging empirical findings on immunological mediation of parasite competition.",https://openalex.org/W1998263965,e34b6aa506a2b708acd53876f38f7358e45fa6ab,0,True,0.9921417236328125,0

Yet, differences between these two mechanisms may lead to different cascading impacts on lower trophic levels. Using a crab‐snail‐barnacle rocky intertidal food chain, we tested the effects of predation risk from crabs (top predators) on intraspecific competition among snails (intermediate consumers) and emergent indirect effects on the density of and competition among barnacles (basal resources). The per capita foraging and growth rates of snails declined with high conspecific density. Predation risk from crabs, which caused even larger reductions in snail foraging and growth, weakened competition among snails, whereas a 45% increase in barnacle density had no detectable effect on snail competition. Intraspecific competition between barnacles, however, depended on the interactive effects of barnacle density, snail density, and crab predation risk. Barnacles developed hummocking morphologies as they grew and competed for space. Hummock formation (a proxy for competition) increased as a result of either greater initial barnacle density or reduced snail foraging pressure, but these effects depended on predation risk. The effects of crab predation risk on snail foraging behavior weakened an otherwise strong relationship between barnacle density and hummock development: hummocking increased with barnacle density in the absence of crabs but remained relatively high when crabs were present. In communities with similar final barnacle densities, hummocking was more common in those with crabs than those without crabs. The extent to which predators can drive trophic cascades by suppressing the foraging rates of their prey is highly context‐dependent: the positive trait‐mediated indirect effect of predators on basal resource abundance is stronger when many prey respond simultaneously to the threat of predation. However, our results demonstrate that top predators can also enhance competition among basal resources even when their indirect effect on resource abundance is relatively weak. Hence, the cascading effects of predators on competition within lower trophic levels may play an important but under‐appreciated role in the dynamics of basal resource populations and the communities they support.

Generally, divergence is assumed to occur when selection acts on the same, continuously varying trait in both species. However, selection might target multiple traits, and even closely related heterospecifics involved in character displacement might differ in selective targets. We investigated the targets of selection in a species of spadefoot toad, Spea multiplicata, during experimentally imposed competition with a congener, S. bombifrons. When examining traits separately, we found significant selection acting on multiple resource-acquisition traits. Yet, controlling for the independent effects of these traits in a multiple regression revealed that direct selection on a single trait might have contributed toward indirect selection on other correlated traits. Moreover, although we found evidence for plasticity in most traits, competition with S. bombifrons imposed selection on morphology and not on plasticity. Additional experiments suggest that the selective targets during character displacement might differ between the two species involved in this one instance of character displacement. Identifying the targets of competitively mediated selection is crucial, because whether and how character displacement ultimately unfolds depends on the nature of these targets and correlations among them.",https://openalex.org/W1882042664,630db8a71a3f75648629f6f645f0ea88d952d50b,0,True,0.9872004985809326,0

Crops are often colonised by aphids having different life‐history traits, and the aphids and their offspring compete for the shared resource. The intraspecific competition and dispersal characteristics of two strains (A and B) of the cotton aphid Aphis gossypii on cucumber were examined in a greenhouse study. Strain A normally feeds on cucumber, whereas strain B originated from melon but develops on cucumber. Both strains reproduce exclusively via parthenogenesis and can be discriminated using molecular markers. 2. The strains were released at the same time on different plants in a greenhouse. Total density and their dispersion within and between plants were recorded through time, and the frequency of each strain was assessed using DNA fingerprinting. The Lotka–Volterra competition model was used to test for inter‐strain competition and to estimate its intensity. 3. Strain A had the highest rate of increase and carrying capacity, and became the most frequent strain, nearly displacing strain B. Strain B was the most common only on the plants it infested first. The competition was unbalanced as strain B was affected strongly by strain A, but strain A was only affected minimally by strain B. This asymmetrical relationship for strain B was not due only to competition for the shared resource. 4. Such competition may in part explain the reduction of genetic polymorphism observed by others in the field where colonising strains coming from different hosts compete and some are eliminated. Polymorphism in A. gossypii populations in nature is thought to be maintained by heterogeneous patches of hosts differentially favourable for different clones.",https://openalex.org/W1962220962,dd4c914d4caf1cd115404f9df9b0180e9774f842,0,True,0.9867861270904541,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8229,Exploring multitrophic interactions in oilseed rape fields reveals the prevailing role of Carabidae,"In cropped fields, birds are often at the highest position in the food chain, feeding on pest arthropods and their intermediate predators in a process known as intraguild predation. The net effects of bird predation on phytophagous insect populations (feeding on plants) are difficult to predict without comprehensively describing prey-predator communities and their complex interplay. We sampled bird and arthropod communities in 30 oilseed rape fields in the spring of 2019 and 2020 in France. To assess the top-down control of arthropods by birds, we used a vertebrate exclusion experiment. Using a taxonomic and functional trait-based approach, we determined the direct and indirect influences of birds on arthropod predators and phytophagous insect populations in arable crops. We observed a negative relationship between the abundance of Carabidae and phytophagous insects but not with the other predator group suggesting the key role of Carabidae on phytophagous insects in agroecosystem. We found no statistical evidence of intraguild predation from birds toward intermediate predators. Despite the lack of overall effect of predator functional diversity on their prey, we highlighted the negative relationship between the functional complementarity (through functional evenness) of Carabidae and the abundance of phytophagous insects. This result suggests that functional complementarity between Carabidae species could help to reduce phytophagous insect populations. We analyzed the effect of agricultural practices on these multitrophic interactions, showing that pesticide intensity only had detrimental effects on Carabidae abundance, while the frequency of tillage did not affect the studied communities. Complementary indices used to depict communities are helpful to better understand the mechanisms underlying trophic relationships.",https://openalex.org/W3206575524,9ba77cb1fe41f2ad0f4e064cfe82e6bca8e86620,0,True,0.9727040529251099,0

While non‐consumptive predator effects have been mostly studied in three‐level food chains, we lack evidence for the propagation of non‐consumptive indirect effects of apex predators in four level food‐webs, notably in terrestrial ecosystems. In experimental mesocosms, we manipulated a four‐level food chain including top‐predator cues (snakes), mesopredators (lizards), herbivores (crickets), and primary producers (plants). The strength of the trophic cascade induced by mesopredators through the consumption of herbivores decreased in the presence of top‐predator cues. Specifically, primary production was higher in mesocosms where mesopredators were present relative to mesocosms with herbivores only, and this difference was reduced in presence of top‐predator cues, probably through a trait‐mediated effect on lizard foraging. Our study demonstrates that non‐consumptive effects of predation risk can cascade down to affect both herbivores and plants in a four‐level terrestrial food chain and emphasises the need to quantify the importance of such indirect effects in natural communities.",https://openalex.org/W2048307119,987dd36f0577e5539a5aad84b1f24ada089f01be,0,True,0.9905790686607361,0

Two different evolutionary responses that remove a disadvantageous heterozygote phenotype from the population are the evolution of strictly assortative mate choice, and that of a modifier making one of the two alleles completely dominant. We derive invasion fitness of mutants introducing dominance or assortative mate choice in a randomly mating population with a genetic polymorphism for an ecological trait. Mutations with small effects as well as mutants introducing complete dominance or perfect assorting are considered. Using adaptive dynamics techniques, we are able to calculate the ratio of fitness gradients for the effects of a dominance modifier and a mate choice locus, near evolutionary branching points. With equal resident allele frequencies, selection for mate choice is always stronger. Dominance is more strongly selected than assortative mating when the resident (common) alleles have very unequal frequencies at equilibrium. With female mate choice the difference in frequencies where dominance is more strongly selected is smaller than when mutants of both sexes can choose without costs. A symmetric resource-competition model illustrates the results.",https://openalex.org/W2057090582,75c9ac0d5cdd31e9a74a2f5ef40718685a0400b2,0,True,0.9796841740608215,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13785,Eco‐evolutionary feedbacks between prey densities and linkage disequilibrium in the predator maintain diversity,"Diversity occurs at multiple scales. Within a single population, there is diversity in genotypes and phenotypes. At a larger scale, within ecological communities, there is diversity in species. A number of studies have investigated how diversity at these two scales influence each other through what has been termed eco‐evolutionary feedbacks. Here we study a three‐species ecological module called apparent competition, in which the predator is evolving in a trait that determines its interaction with two prey species. Unlike previous studies on apparent competition, which employed evolutionary frameworks with very simple genetics, we study an eco‐evolutionary model in which the predator's trait is determined by two recombining diallelic loci, so that its mean and variance can evolve, as well as associations (linkage disequilibrium) between the loci. We ask how eco‐evolutionary feedbacks with these two loci affect the coexistence of the prey species and the maintenance of polymorphisms within the predator species. We uncover a novel eco‐evolutionary feedback between the prey densities and the linkage disequilibrium between the predator's loci. Through a stability analysis, we demonstrate how these feedbacks affect polymorphisms at both loci and, among others, may generate stable cycling.",https://openalex.org/W2950984107,5c1f5eee4236efd0386a6133a849a9af121aeafb,0,True,0.9952742457389832,0

These two fish species have quite different predation strategies and energetic requirements. Periphyton in the Galaxias streams formed relatively low biomass (indicative of high invertebrate grazing), whereas periphyton in two of the three trout streams formed relatively high biomass (indicative of lower grazing pressure). Periphyton biomass response to inorganic nutrient enrichment varied by fish type. Invertebrate densities on artificial substrates were higher in the Galaxias streams, with the exception of chironomids. Nutrient enrichment of periphyton led to increases in total invertebrate densities, but these increases were greater in the Galaxias streams where invertebrate predation was thought to be lower. Our results suggest that the specific feeding behavior traits of the consumers should be considered when investigating trophic cascades or predicting effects of bottom-up nutrient enrichment on autotrophy.",https://openalex.org/W2018839133,19f3e77ecc7322b5ab832f3a09ba4d9fc9b92a95,0,True,0.9851536154747009,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01554.x,Disentangling multiple predator effects in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning research,"M. O’Connor & J. Bruno (2009) Predator richness has no effect in a diverse marine food web. Journal of Animal Ecology, 78, 732–740. Disentangling the effects of predator loss can be complex as predators exert a suite of direct and indirect effects in ecosystems. O’Connor & Bruno manipulated predator abundance, richness, and composition in experiments with and without prey dispersal in an estuarine ecosystem. They observed effects of predator presence and composition on prey assemblages, particularly in experiments without prey dispersal, but they found no effect of predator richness on prey assemblage. Here, we discuss the role of non-additive, antagonistic, and spatial effects of predators in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning experiments, with a particular focus on the results of O’Connor & Bruno. Predators are disproportionately threatened by human activities relative to other trophic groups (Pauly et al. 1998; Duffy 2003) and predator extinctions can have cascading effects in ecosystems (e.g. Terborgh et al. 2001; Duffy 2003). The strength of these effects varies among ecosystems (Shurin et al. 2002) and depends on the assemblage of predators present (Bruno & Cardinale 2008). Given current rates of biodiversity loss, there is a sense of urgency to develop a better understanding of the functional consequences of biodiversity loss in different ecosystems. Most biodiversity and ecosystem functioning studies, however, focus on sessile organisms because mobile organisms, like predators, are much more difficult to control, like herbaceaus plants (Duffy et al. 2007). Studies that investigate the effects of predators in ecosystems usually focus on the direct effects of a single predator species on prey and the subsequent indirect or cascading effects on producers (Hairston, Smith, & Slobodkin 1960; Oksanen et al. 1981; Carpenter, Kitchell, & Hodgson 1985). A growing number of studies are now investigating the effects of predator richness in ecosystems (reviewed in Duffy et al. 2007), but these studies are often limited to small spatial scales and few species. Natural ecosystems are complex (Polis & Strong 1996) and presently, we have resolved the complete web of trophic interactions in only a few cases. Consequently, we currently lack a synthetic understanding of the multiple effects of predators in ecosystems (Fig. 1). In this issue of the Journal of Animal Ecology, O’Connor & Bruno (2009) designed field and mesocosm experiments to disentangle the effects of predator abundance, diversity, and composition on diverse prey assemblages in a subtidal estuarine food web in Bogue Sound, North Carolina, USA. Conceptual diagram of the multiple effects of predators in ecosystems. Consumptive effects are represented with solid lines, nonconsumptive effects are represented with dashed lines, and spatial effects are represented with dotted lines. 1, Direct consumption; 2, trait-mediated, nonlethal interactions; 3, omnivory; 4, trophic cascades; 5, nutrient recycling; 6, intraspecific interference; 7, intraguild predation; 8, competition; and 9, spatial subsidies. O’Connor & Bruno (2009) measured direct consumption (1) and partially controlled for intraguild predation (7). O’Connor & Bruno's (2009) study system is ideal for experimental manipulation because it harbours a diverse predator assemblage (10 species) and a high diversity of amphipod, isopod, and gastropod prey species (52), which have rapid demographic responses to changes in predation and habitat quality. O’Connor & Bruno (2009) designed two field experiments where prey species were able to disperse and one mesocosm experiment that was closed to prey dispersal. Their study is one of the few experiments to vary prey dispersal and predator diversity and composition simultaneously, although they did not control prey dispersal. Predator presence reduced prey density by at least half and reduced prey richness by one to six species but both effects depended on the predator species present. Overall, shrimp presence had the strongest effects on prey density and richness. In two of the experiments predator presence also significantly shifted prey composition. For example, in the presence of shrimp the relative abundance of the amphipod, Elasmopus levis, more than doubled whereas the relative abundance of the isopod, Paracerceis caudata, decreased by threefold. These effects were strongest in the mesocosm experiment, where prey dispersal did not occur. This suggests that prey dispersal may dampen the effects of multiple predators on prey, although these results are confounded by the fact that prey diversity was also lowest in the mesocosm experiment. O’Connor & Bruno (2009) did not find a significant effect of predator richness on prey density, richness, or composition. Here we explore two potential reasons why O’Connor & Bruno (2009) did not observe an effect of predator richness on prey assemblages: (i) non-additive, antagonistic interactions between predators, and (ii) spatial effects. Sih, Englund, & Wooster (1998) defined three categories of multiple-predator effects: linear (i.e. substitutable and additive), risk enhancing (i.e. synergistic) or risk reducing (i.e. antagonistic). Non-additive, antagonistic interactions between predators are frequent (Finke & Denno 2005; Schmitz 2007; Bruno & Cardinale 2008), and theory demonstrates that these interactions can decrease the per capita capture rates of predator species and dampen the effects of multiple predators on prey assemblages (Ives, Cardinale, & Snyder 2005; Casula, Wilby & Thomas 2006). Interference, intraguild predation, and nonlethal interactions are common non-additive, antagonistic interactions (Schmitz 2007). For example, Finke & Denno (2005) observed that intraguild predation dampened the effects of predators (i.e. spiders, beetles) on herbivores (i.e. planthoppers) and producers (i.e. cordgrass) in a salt-marsh mesocosm study. O’Connor & Bruno (2009) held predator density constant in all their experiments and to limit the effects of intraguild predation, they checked each enclosure at least twice during the experiments and replaced missing predators. They were able to estimate the potential magnitude of density-mediated intraguild predation but they were not able to quantify the trait-mediated, nonlethal effects of intraguild predators in experimental cages. Shrimps were the most common victim of intraguild predation but they also had the strongest, negative effects on prey density relative to other predators in monoculture and they significantly reduced prey richness, evenness, and composition as described above. As a result, intraguild predation on shrimps may have played the same role as an additional trophic level controlling the most efficient consumers in this system, i.e., it generated a negative selection effect that opposed any complementarity effect among predators (Loreau & Hector 2001; Thébault & Loreau 2003). Furthermore, predators can have both density- and trait-mediated effects on prey species (e.g. Schmitz 2003); therefore, we should expect that the presence of an intraguild predator may also have the potential to cause trait-mediated indirect effects on the predators they consume. The presence of nonlethal interactions between predators in the O’Connor & Bruno (2009) experiments, however, may have been limited because prey did not have access to refuge area. Conversely, the potential for intraguild predation to dampen the effects of predator richness on prey assemblages appears to be strong in this ecosystem. The flow of energy, material, and organisms across ecosystems, most commonly referred to as allochthonous inputs or spatial subsidies, is ubiquitous (Polis, Anderson & Holt 1997; Loreau, Mouquet & Holt 2003). Theory and experiments that incorporate spatial flows can be complex but offer new insights into the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. For example, McCann, Rasmussen, & Umbanhowar (2005) provided empirical data and theoretical analysis to demonstrate that mobile predators can couple distinct patches and stabilize complex ecosystems. Similarly, Nakano & Murakami (2001) demonstrated a strong reliance of aquatic (i.e. fish) and terrestrial (i.e. birds) consumers on subsidies during different times of the year. O’Connor & Bruno (2009) found limited differences between the experiments that allowed prey dispersal and the one that did not. In the field experiments, prey were able to disperse to and from the regional species pool; therefore, we would expect dampened effects of caged predators because of quick replacement of lost prey within the inclusion cages. A thorough understanding of who eats whom, who affects whom in other ways, and the dispersal abilities of different species is critical to predicting the effects of diversity in natural ecosystems, particularly for the top of the food chain where indirect effects are common (Fig. 1). O’Connor & Bruno (2009) is part of a group of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning studies that have manipulated predator diversity. Results from these studies demonstrate that multiple predators may have null, additive, antagonistic, or synergistic effects on prey assemblages (Cardinale et al. 2006; Duffy et al. 2007; Bruno & Cardinale 2008). The habitat domain of predator and prey (i.e. spatial movement) and hunting mode of the predator interact to shape the outcome of multiple-predator effects in ecosystems (Schmitz 2007). O’Connor & Bruno's (2009) experiments are limited because they artificially reduced the habitat domain of the predators by preventing predator dispersal. Experiments with spatially constrained designs, such as small enclosures, may facilitate antagonistic effects between predators because predators in constrained habitats may hunt each other (Schmitz 2007). Predator dispersal may create spatial heterogeneity in predator–prey dynamics because predators will be able to actively select areas with preferred food and abandon areas with undesirable food (France & Duffy 2006). This will also enable intraguild prey to find spatial refuges. Densities of prey in these refuge areas may decrease as a result of increased predation pressure (e.g. Schmitz 2003). Natural ecosystems are open to spatial flows at all trophic levels, therefore, future experiments should explicitly test for the effects of predator mobility on prey assemblages. To incorporate predator mobility effectively, the spatial extent of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning experiments will likely have to increase to accommodate the larger foraging spectrum of most predators. Diverse predator assemblages are becoming increasingly rare both on land and at sea. Biodiversity loss at the top of food chains can have strong cascading effects but we still have a rudimentary understanding of these effects in diverse, spatially extended ecosystems. Future studies on the effects of predator diversity in ecosystems should simultaneously consider non-additive and nontrophic interactions and spatial effects of predators in addition to their direct trophic effects through local prey consumption. Schmitz (2007) provides a theoretical framework for incorporating multiple-predator effects in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning experiments. A more thorough understanding of the multiple effects of predator in ecosystems is required to inform conservation and management of biodiversity in our rapidly changing world. We thank C.

https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13219,Spillover of an alien parasite reduces expression of costly behaviour in native host species,"Abstract Understanding the effects of invasive alien species (IAS) on native host–parasite relationships is of importance for enhancing ecological theory and IAS management. When IAS and their parasite(s) invade a guild, the effects of interspecific resource competition and/or parasite‐mediated competition can alter existing native host–parasite relationships and the dependent biological traits such as native species' behaviour. We used a natural experiment of populations of native red squirrels Sciurus vulgaris that were colonized by the alien grey squirrel Sciurus carolinensis, comparing repeated measurements of red squirrel parasite infection and personality with those taken in sites where only the native species occurred. We explored two alternative hypotheses: (a) individual differences in personality traits (activity and/or sociability) of native red squirrel positively affect the probability of macroparasite spillover and thus the likelihood to acquire the alien's parasitic helminth Strongyloides robustus ; (b) the combined effects of grey squirrel presence and parasite infection result in a reduction of costly personality traits (activity and/or exploration). Using data from 323 arena tests across three experimental (native species and IAS) and three control sites (only native species), we found negative correlations between native species' activity and infection with S. robustus in the sites invaded by the alien species. Activity was also negatively correlated with infection by its native helminth Trypanoxyuris sciuri but only when grey squirrels were present, while in the red‐only sites there was no relationship of T. sciuri infection with any of the personality traits. Moreover, individuals that acquired S. robustus during the study reduced their activity after infection, while this was not the case for animals that remained uninfected. Our results show that parasite‐mediated competition is costly, reducing activity in individuals of the native species, and altering the native host–native parasite relationships.",https://openalex.org/W3016233474,a2daa8581a3d839b4ab139c2ccde74f4cfefd47f,0,True,0.981473445892334,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1749-4877.12543,Palatability and profitability of co‐occurring seeds alter indirect interactions among rodent‐dispersed trees,"Beyond direct species interactions, seed dispersal is potentially affected by indirect seed-seed interactions among co-occurring nut-bearing trees which are mediated by scatter-hoarding animals as shared seed dispersers. A relevant question in such systems is to what extent different functional traits related to food palatability and profitability affect the kinds of indirect interactions that occur among co-occurring seeds, and the consequences for seed dispersal. We used field experiments to track seed dispersal with individually tagged seeds in both monospecific and mixed seed communities. We measured indirect effects based on 3 seed-seed species pairs from the family Fagaceae with contrasting seed size, tannin level, and dormancy in a subtropical forest in Southwest China. When all else was equal, the presence of adjacently placed seeds with contrasting seed traits created different indirect effects measured through a variety of dispersal-related indicators. Apparent mutualism was reciprocal due to increasing seed dispersal in mixed seed patches with mixed differences in seed tannins and dormancy. However, differences in either seed size or dormancy in co-occurring adjacently placed seeds caused apparent competition with reduced seed removal or seed dispersal (distance) in at least one species. Our study supports the hypothesis that different functional traits related to food palatability and profitability in co-occurring seeds modify foraging decisions of scatter-hoarding animals, and subsequently cause indirect effects on seed dispersal among rodent-dispersed trees. We conclude that such indirect effects mediated by shared seed dispersers may act as an important determinant of seed dispersal for co-fruiting animal-dispersed trees in many natural forests.",https://openalex.org/W3156834625,31faca2b2a087e6f8928de7a290a2d35d28f09bb,0,True,0.9892236590385437,0

We studied the interactions among the herb Ruellia nudiflora, a seed predator, and its parasitoids using 14 maternal plant families grown in a common garden. By fertilizing half of the plants of each family and subsequently recording fruit number, seed predator number, and parasitoid number per plant, we sought to compare the strength of plant genetic effects with those of soil fertility, and determine if these factors interactively shape tri‐trophic interactions. Furthermore, we evaluated if these bottom–up factors influenced higher trophic levels through changes in abundance across trophic levels (density‐mediated) or changes in the function of species interactions (trait‐mediated). Plant genetic effects on seed predators and parasitoids were stronger than fertilization effects. Moreover, we did not find plant genetic variation for fertilization effects on fruit, seed predator, or parasitoid abundance, showing that each factor acted independently on plant resources and higher trophic levels. Both bottom–up forces were transmitted via density‐mediated effects where increased fruit number from fertilization and plant genetic effects increased seed predator and parasitoid abundance; however, seed predator attack was density‐dependent, while parasitoid attack was density‐independent. Importantly, there was evidence (marginally significant in one case) that fertilization modified the function of plant‐seed predator and seed predator–parasitoid interactions by increasing the number of seed predators per fruit and decreasing the number of parasitoids per seed predator, respectively. These findings show that plant genetic and soil fertility effects cascaded up this simple food chain, that plant genetic effects were stronger across all trophic levels, and that these effects were transmitted independently and through contrasting mechanisms.",https://openalex.org/W2124078035,072576f83dd041c1f30f82d9b3a39e25abe571b9,0,True,0.97081059217453,0
https://doi.org/10.1890/09-0979.1,Dietary flexibility aids Asian earthworm invasion in North American forests,"On a local scale, invasiveness of introduced species and invasibility of habitats together determine invasion success. A key issue in invasion ecology has been how to quantify the contribution of species invasiveness and habitat invasibility separately. Conventional approaches, such as comparing the differences in traits and/or impacts of species between native and/or invaded ranges, do not determine the extent to which the performance of invaders is due to either the effects of species traits or habitat characteristics. Here we explore the interaction between two of the most widespread earthworm invaders in the world (Asian Amynthas agrestis and European Lumbricus rubellus ) and study the effects of species invasiveness and habitat invasibility separately through an alternative approach of “third habitat” in Tennessee, USA. We propose that feeding behaviors of earthworms will be critical to invasion success because trophic ecology of invasive animals plays a key role in the invasion process. We found that (1) the biomass and isotopic abundances (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) of A. agrestis were not impacted by either direct effects of L. rubellus competition or indirect effects of L. rubellus ‐preconditioned habitat; (2) A. agrestis disrupted the relationship between L. rubellus and soil microorganisms and consequently hindered litter consumption by L. rubellus ; and (3) compared to L. rubellus, A. agrestis shifted its diet more readily to consume more litter, more soil gram‐positive (G+) bacteria (which may be important for litter digestion), and more non‐microbial soil fauna when soil microorganisms were depleted. In conclusion, A. agrestis showed strong invasiveness through its dietary flexibility through diet shifting and superior feeding behavior and its indirectly negative effect of habitat invasibility on L. rubellus via changes in the soil microorganism community. In such context, our results expand on the resource fluctuation hypothesis and support the superior competitor hypothesis. This work presents additional approaches in invasion ecology, provides some new dimensions for further research, and contributes to a greater understanding of the importance of interactions between multiple invading species.",https://openalex.org/W2135194816,25aa79f2640a5ac2dcac659e9b6b629afbc532fd,0,True,0.988605260848999,0

Higher-order ecological effects beyond pairwise interactions may be key to complex ecosystems, but mechanisms to produce these effects remain poorly understood. Here we model microbial growth and competition to show that higher-order effects can arise from variation in multiple microbial growth traits, such as lag times and growth rates, on a single limiting resource with no other interactions. These effects produce a range of ecological phenomena: an unlimited number of strains can exhibit multistability and neutral coexistence, potentially with a single keystone strain; strains that coexist in pairs do not coexist all together; and a strain that wins all pairwise competitions can go extinct in a mixed competition. Since variation in multiple growth traits is ubiquitous in microbial populations, our results indicate these higher-order effects may also be widespread, especially in laboratory ecology and evolution experiments.",https://openalex.org/W3100236633,2c00165cc717678ca3cfa47016791380206e1a60,0,True,0.934320867061615,0

Among the most striking examples are resource polymorphisms, where alternative morphs that utilize different resources evolve within a population. An underappreciated aspect of their evolution is that the same conditions that favor resource polymorphism-competition and ecological opportunity-might foster additional rounds of diversification within already existing morphs. We examined these issues in spadefoot toad tadpoles that develop into either a generalist ""omnivore"" or a specialist ""carnivore"" morph. Specifically, we assessed the morphological diversity of tadpoles from natural ponds and experimentally induced carnivores reared on alternative diets. We also surveyed natural ponds to determine if the strength of intramorph competition and the diversity and abundance of dietary resources (measures of ecological opportunity) influenced the diversity of within-morph variation. We found that five omnivore and four carnivore types were present in natural ponds; alternative diets led to shape differences, some of which mirrored variation in the wild; and both competition and ecological opportunity were associated with enhanced morphological diversity in natural ponds. Such fine-scale intraspecific variation might represent an underappreciated form of biodiversity and might constitute a crucible of evolutionary innovation and diversification.",https://openalex.org/W2750206028,95ee207638c103fce4cbb4faacc16340399bedbd,0,True,0.9407746195793152,0

This interest seems to have originally stemmed from models suggesting that host-parasite interactions might explain previously anomalous features of the natural world, such as sexual reproduction (Hamilton 1980), female mate choice (Hamilton and Zuk 1982), the maintenance of genetic diversity (Haldane 1949), and the regulation of host populations (Anderson and May 1979; May and Anderson 1979). The interest was further increased by early theory on the evolution of parasite virulence (May and Anderson 1983) as well as by concerns regarding the emergence of infectious diseases. Here we present a short list of interesting open questions for future research. The questions are based on an American Society of Naturalists Symposium in 2013 entitled, ""Disease Ecology, Evolution, and Coevolution."" Our list is not meant to be exhaustive, as many important questions remain, but we hope that it will encourage additional work in these areas.Figure 1.

Some theoretical work suggests that host genetic diversity by itself should not affect disease spread (Springbett et al. 2003; Yates et al. 2006; Nath et al. 2008), but it could reduce the severity of epidemics if they occur (Springbett et al. 2003). Another model suggests, in contrast, that R0 should be inversely proportional to the genetic variation for resistance in the host population (Lively 2010). The difference in results comes from different assumptions regarding the nature of the variation in the host and parasite populations. It would seem, at present, that genetic variation in susceptibility (where all hosts are susceptible to some degree) does not have a large effect on R0 (Springbett et al. 2003; Yates et al. 2006; Nath et al. 2008), while genetic variation among hosts for their self/nonself recognition systems could reduce R0, provided different parasite strains infect different host genotypes (Lively 2010).Hence, whether or not host genetic diversity reduces the risk of infection will depend heavily on the answer to a related question: what is the genetic basis for disease resistance? Highly polymorphic genetic systems that require some kind of phenotypic match (or molecular mimicry) by the parasite for successful infection would be the most likely to reduce R0. Much remains to be discovered, but recent data suggest that such polymorphic systems do exist, even for organisms that do not have the sophisticated immune responses of vertebrate animals (e.g., Tian et al. 2002; Mitta et al. 2012; Thrall et al. 2012; Drayman et al. 2013; Barribeau et al. 2014). Detailed information from a broader array of organisms would be highly valued.There is also a need for more field and laboratory studies that experimentally examine the notion that genetic diversity can reduce disease prevalence and R0. The idea has support from agricultural systems (Zhu et al. 2000; Mundt 2002), but experiments involving natural populations are rare (reviewed in King and Lively 2012). Some exceptional work in support of the idea has been published on the diseases of Daphnia (Altermatt and Ebert 2008; Ganz and Ebert 2010) and bees (Schmid-Hempel 1998), but more experimental studies on a greater variety of natural systems is needed.Question 2: How Is Host/Parasite Genetic Diversity Maintained?This is one of the longest-standing questions in the ecology and evolution of infectious disease, but much still remains to be discovered regarding the generality and the relative importance of various evolutionary mechanisms. Perhaps Haldane (1949) was correct to think that the advantage of possessing rare resistance genotypes leads naturally to the maintenance of genetic diversity, but the evidence from natural populations is restricted to just a few study systems (e.g., Antonovics and Ellstrand 1984; Koskella and Lively 2009; Wolinska and Spaak 2009; Thrall et al. 2012). Moreover, if parasite-mediated selection can favor rare host genotypes, can it also favor cross-fertilization over self-fertilization and parthenogenesis, as originally suggested by Hamilton (1980), Levin (1975), and Jaenike (1978), and as studied by Vergara et al. (2014) in this symposium issue?Recent work in ecoimmunology has proposed an additional (but not mutually exclusive) explanation for the maintenance of genetic diversity in hosts. These relate specifically to trade-offs in host immunity (Sheldon and Verhulst 1996; Demas and Nelson 2012). For example, given experimental evidence that resistance against parasites can deplete the host's energetic reserves (e.g., Martin et al. 2007) and cause collateral damage to the host's own tissues (e.g., Clatworthy et al. 2007), costs of immunity have the potential to reduce survival or fecundity of resistant hosts in nature. When the risk of exposure is low, costs of immunity may even outweigh the costs of parasitism. Indeed, the cost-benefit ratio for resistance alleles that confer strong immune responses is expected to fluctuate with risk of exposure (Viney et al. 2005). Natural selection is therefore expected to maintain susceptibility alleles in host populations. Furthermore, there are costs as well as benefits to immunological specificity, perhaps mediated by mutual inhibition among T cell subsets (Zhu and Paul 2010; van den Ham et al. 2013), which can prohibit simultaneous resistance against the diverse infections circulating in natural populations (see question 4 below). There is accruing empirical evidence in support of the idea that host diversity is maintained by such costs, even in natural populations of mammals (e.g., Graham et al. 2010). However, much remains to be done to determine the generality of costs of immunity as diversity drivers in natural systems and whether feedbacks with epidemiological dynamics act to maintain resistance variation in nature (as discussed in this symposium issue by Hayward et al. 2014).Indeed, these research areas remain rich veins for future work, and they also open further questions. For example, when and how do the hypothesized mechanisms operate jointly? When might natural selection calibrate the magnitude of resistance independent of its specificity? When might life-history trade-offs (e.g., imposed by survival benefits vs. fecundity costs of resistance) slow Red Queen dynamics? Might we be more likely to detect life-history trade-offs than Ghost-by-Gparasite interactions as causes of host heterogeneity in genetically complex host-parasite systems? Such a unified evolutionary theory of defense (Jokela et al. 2000) remains to be tested empirically.Question 3: What Are the Effects of External Biotic and Abiotic Factors on Virulence and the Risk of Infection?Most of our current understanding of host-parasite dynamics stems from variations on classical susceptible-infected (SI) models (Kermack and McKendrick 1927; Anderson and May 1982, 1991; Hudson et al. 2002). These models generally view the host-parasite interaction as a two-way interaction and assume that virulence, parasite transmission, and host resistance/tolerance are fully controlled by host and parasite (reviewed in Restif and Koella 2003). However, environmental variables, both abiotic and biotic, can dramatically alter these traits. For example, variables such as temperature and diet have been shown to strongly alter parasite growth, transmission, and virulence (Agnew and Koella 1999; Brown et al. 2000; Thomas and Blanford 2003; Mitchell et al. 2005; Wolinska and King 2009; Lefèvre et al. 2013; Howick and Lazzaro 2014). In addition, virulence, as measured under laboratory or greenhouse conditions, may vastly underestimate the fitness effects of infection in the wild, especially when virulence increases with increasing host density (i.e., when virulence is density dependent; Lively 2006; Donnelly et al. 2012). At present there are only a few studies that experimentally examine this possibility under natural conditions (e.g., Lively et al. 1995; Bell et al. 2006). Finally, as discussed below, hosts and parasites are members of larger communities of interacting species, which creates additional challenges for measuring parasite fitness and virulence in the wild. Meeting these challenges, however, seems essential to fully understand the evolution of host-parasite interactions.Community effects on host-parasite dynamics can occur through both density- and trait-mediated effects. Many studies to date have shown that a third species can have density-mediated indirect effects by changing the absolute or relative abundance of host species and thereby altering disease prevalence and severity (Mitchell et al. 2002; LoGiudice et al. 2003; Keesing et al. 2006; Johnson et al. 2008, 2013; Borer et al. 2009). Trait-mediated indirect effects are also becoming increasingly apparent (Raffel et al. 2008; 2010). For example, studies have shown that predatory midges can enhance parasite transmission by tearing apart parasite-filled waterfleas (Cáceres et al. 2009; Auld et al. 2014), that predators can suppress the immunity of a herbivorous beetle to its parasites (Ramirez and Snyder 2009), and that aphids can increase the virulence of monarch butterfly parasites by reducing the defensive chemistry of shared food plants (de Roode et al. 2011). Trait-mediated indirect effects are especially pervasive in tritrophic interactions between plants, herbivorous animals and their parasites, where virulence, transmission, and host defenses are regularly altered by plant defensive chemistry and nutrition (Cory and Hoover 2006).Environmental and community effects on host-parasite interactions are not necessarily passive effects. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly clear that hosts may employ specific behaviors to increase their protection against parasites, thereby reducing parasite virulence and transmission. Such behaviors may focus on abiotic factors such as temperature, as demonstrated by infected locusts that seek out higher temperatures to reduce fungal pathogen growth (Elliot et al. 2002), or they may focus on natural products or living species. For example, wood ants and bees incorporate conifer resin into their nests, which reduces microbial growth (Chapuisat et al. 2007; Simone et al. 2009). Moreover, a wide variety of animal species, from apes to woolly bear caterpillars, specifically consume antiparasite plants in response to active infection or risk of disease (Huffman 2001; Singer et al. 2009; de Roode et al. 2013). However, it is once again important to recognize that the host-parasite interaction is embedded in a larger food web and that, in some cases, strategies used to reduce the risk of attack by one natural enemy might increase vulnerability to another (e.g., Ramirez and Snyder 2009; Duffy et al. 2011).The fact that abiotic and biotic factors can alter host-parasite interactions—and that animals may specifically use these factors to reduce infection and virulence—may have important consequences for disease ecology and evolution. Although some insights have been gained, especially with regard to the relationship between relative host abundance and parasite infection and virulence (Johnson et al. 2013), many other questions remain. For example, environmental conditions—whether abiotic or biotic—generally vary strongly across host habitat. Thus, hosts across a population will rarely all experience the same environment. Instead, host populations may be better viewed as inhabiting an environmental mosaic in which environmental conditions and ecological communities vary (Thompson 1994). Such environmental heterogeneity may contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation in hosts and parasites (Wolinska and King 2009) and is likely to influence the severity of disease outbreaks (e.g., Duffy et al. 2012). Environmental heterogeneity may also affect the evolution of virulence. As shown in this issue, the passaging of parasites through immune-suppressed hosts can lead to the evolution of more virulent parasites strains (Barclay et al. 2014). Hence, a geographic mosaic that contains pockets of immune-suppressed individuals could lead to the evolution and spread of more virulent forms of disease.Environmental and community effects may also be crucial to our understanding of host and/or parasite local adaptation. Natural selection is generally expected to lead to parasite populations that are more infective to their local host populations (Gandon and Michalakis 2002). However, many studies have looked for, but not found, such adaptation (reviewed in Greischar and Koskella 2007; Hoeksema and Forde 2008). One potential reason for the lack of local adaptation is that many of these studies are based on lab experiments in which hosts and parasites from multiple populations are exposed to each other under laboratory conditions. These studies would capture any specific genetic adaptations but would miss any effects of the local environment or ecological community (e.g., Sternberg et al. 2013). Therefore, adaptations that rely on interactions with the environment, or other interacting species, would be detected only when replicating those factors (Cory and Myers 2004; Lazzaro et al. 2008; Sternberg and Thomas 2014). Finally, depending on the study system, allowing hosts to display their natural behavior in the wild could be crucial, as hosts may evolve resistance through behaviors such as medication (Choisy and de Roode 2014). Laboratory studies of local adaptation can nonetheless generate valuable information, and they can be used to more precisely dissect the rates of evolutionary change, as shown by two articles in this symposium issue (Koskella 2014; Morran et al. 2014).Question 4: Are Lessons Learned from Single Host-Parasite Pairings Generalizable to the Multihost-Multiparasite Networks That Dominate in Nature?Most hosts are infected by multiple parasite species, and most parasites can infect multiple host species. However, while such multihost-multiparasite interactions are the norm in nature, they have received relatively little empirical study (Fenton and Pedersen 2005; Rigaud et al. 2010). In the most simplistic (and unrealistic) scenario, a system would be composed of a single parasite genotype and a single host genotype. In reality, communities are composed of many host and parasite species, each of which contains many genotypes. What fundamental differences emerge when this complexity is added? The addition of diversity within species is likely to be important, as discussed in question 1 above. Here, we focus on the addition of interspecific diversity. Can the outcomes of multihost-multiparasite interaction networks be predicted by studies of the individual components?In some cases, the presence of multiple species will fundamentally alter the outcomes of host-parasite interactions. For example, because of impacts on the immune system (e.g., mutual inhibition among the T cell subsets required to clear ""worms"" versus those that clear ""germs""; Zhu and Paul 2010; van den Ham et al. 2013), multiparasite dynamics might differ from those predicted from studies of single host and parasite species (Lello et al. 2004; Ezenwa et al. 2010). In this case, adding species may be fundamentally different from adding additional genotypes of the same species. Either way, within-host community ecology can be conceptualized as a tritrophic system in which parasites must compete for resources and evade predation by the immune system (Pedersen and Fenton 2007). Such a framework has proven predictive of the outcome of multispecies infections in both lab (Graham 2008) and field (Pedersen and Antonovics 2013). Indeed, trait-mediated indirect effects due to within-host tritrophic interactions may be as pervasive as those due to external tritrophic interactions (highlighted under question 3, above). Furthermore, theoretical studies of evolution of multihost parasites suggest that the presence of multiple host species can lead to initially unexpected outcomes, such as decreased parasite virulence with increased host mortality in certain scenarios (Gandon 2004; Rigaud et al. 2010).In other cases, lessons learned from studies of intraspecific diversity might be instructive for studies of networks of species. For example, negative frequency-dependent selection by parasites can drive cycling among host genotypes (Jokela et al. 2009; Thrall et al. 2012). For multihost parasites, in many cases, we expect parasites to specialize on different host species (Gandon 2004). In these cases, can negative frequency-dependent selection by parasites drive cycling of host species? This idea has been explored in some depth within microbial communities, where bacteriophages are known to alter apparent competition among their hosts (reviewed in Fuhrman and Schwalbach 2003; Koskella and Brockhurst 2014), but is rarely addressed in eukaryotic systems.Question 5: What Is the Role of Host Microbiota in Shaping Disease Ecology and Evolution?Recent interest in the influence of host microbiota (communities of microorganisms living in and on eukaryotic hosts) on organismal fitness has uncovered a key role of these commensals in mediating susceptibility to disease. For example, the gut microbiota of bumblebees was shown to have a stronger effect on susceptibility to the parasite Crithidia bombi than did the host genotype (Koch and Schmid-Hempel 2012). Similarly, the gut microbiota of humans and mice are known to influence susceptibility to intestinal pathogens (reviewed in Buffie and Pamer 2013), there is evidence suggesting human vaginal microbiota confer protection against HIV infection (Petrova et al. 2013), and skin-associated microbial communities are known to act as a first line of defense against pathogen colonization and infection (Harris et al. 2009; Gallo and Nakatsuji 2011; Naik et al. 2012). Given the known competitive, cooperative, and even spiteful interactions among microbial organisms, any disease protection mediated by the microbiota could be conferred either directly via microbe-microbe interactions or indirectly via the host immune system (Kamada et al. 2013). Unlocking this complexity will be central to predicting when and how immunity is conferred.Although it is now clear that host microbiota can alter susceptibility to disease, it remains an open question as to how important this might be relative to host genetics and environment, and how generalizable the current evidence will prove to be. After all, there are clear cases where particular loci in the host genome are known to be directly involved in disease resistance (Mackey et al. 2002), but it is unknown whether and how the microbiota might interact with host genetics to influence disease. In relation to question 1 above, there is also a good possibility that the variation among hosts with regard to the microbiota they harbor will increase the effective host diversity in a population. For example, even when two hosts share the same suite of alleles conferring resistance, the outcome of infection may well differ depending on the composition of the microbial communities they harbor. On the other hand, host genotype could play a key role in shaping the microbiota, which could in turn affect disease resistance (Spor et al. 2011; Olivares et al. 2013). Disentangling the complex interactions between host genetics, environmental factors, and microbiota on shaping disease susceptibility is likely to be a large feat, requiring a multidisciplinary approach.Microbial communities, including those living in or on eukaryotic hosts, are highly dynamic over time, and we might therefore expect variation in disease susceptibility over the course of a host's lifetime. Drivers of change in microbial communities over time include colonization and evolution, for example, in response to bacteriophage viruses. The human gut microbiota are known to host a high prevalence of phages (Stern et al. 2012), and the leaves of horse-chestnut trees harbor phages that are remarkably well adapted to their local bacterial hosts (Koskella 2014). When such shifts in the microbiota lead to dysbiosis, the results can be both harmful and difficult to reverse. For example, alterations to the gut microbiota can render human hosts more likely to develop high densities of pathogenic Clostridium difficile in their gut. Treatment with traditional antibiotic therapy often fails, but treatments that alter the gut microbiota via fecal transplants have been remarkably successful (Taur and Pamer 2014). However, there is also new evidence that a mismatch between host genotype and the gut microbiota can contribute to the development of cancer (Kodaman et al. 2014) showing that there is still much to be learned about interactions between hosts (including humans) and their microbiomes. It will be of great interest moving forward to monitor the success of ""cross-fostering"" treatments (such as fecal transplants), as they will no doubt uncover the importance of host genetics in shaping the taxonomic composition and host protective effect of the microbial community. Furthermore, it will be important to determine how coevolution between the host and the microbiota influences any protection provided (Bäckhed et al. 2005). Finally, a better understanding of which microbial organisms are the key players in shaping disease susceptibility is required before we can make predictions regarding disease spread in a population or further the development of any specific ""probiotic"" treatments for alleviating or preventing disease.ConclusionsThe surge of interest in the ecology and evolution of host-parasite interactions (fig. 1) has led to some important findings but also to new questions and new ways to conceptualize older questions. One of the major themes running through questions considered here is that the development of new study systems would be very valuable, especially where natural populations can be used in laboratory experiments and/or where experimental studies can be conducted in the wild. One of the difficulties for the future may stem from the great variety of ways in which host and parasites interact in nature and the context in which the interaction takes place. While this variety of systems may prevent sweeping generalizations (at least in the short term), it also seems essential to understand in order to make headway on both basic and applied questions in disease biology (e.g., Rudge et al. 2013). Taken together, it seems likely that this emerging field of study will continue to expand.AcknowledgmentsWe thank the American Society of Naturalist for sponsoring our symposium, ""Disease Ecology, Evolution, and Coevolution,"" held in Snowbird, Utah, in 2013.

https://doi.org/10.1086/bblv223n2p167,Community Ecology and the Evolution of Molecules of Keystone Significance,"Molecules of keystone significance are vital in structuring ecological communities. Select bioactive compounds can cause disproportionately large effects by connecting such seemingly disparate processes as microbial loop dynamics and apex predation. Here, we develop a general theory and propose mechanisms that could lead to the evolution of keystone molecules. Introduced into a respective community by one, or only a few, autotrophic or microbial species, these compounds often originate as chemical defenses. When co-opted by resistant consumer species, however, they are used either in chemical defense against higher-order predators or as chemosensory cues that elicit courtship and mating, alarm, and predatory search. Requisite to these multifunctional properties, biosynthetic capacity evolves along with mechanisms for resistance and/or toxin storage in primary producers. Subsequently, consumers acquire resistances or tolerances, and the toxins are transferred through food webs via trophic interactions. In consumers, mechanisms eventually evolve for recognizing toxins as feeding cues and, ultimately, as signals or pheromones in chemical communication within or between species. One, or a few, active compounds can thus mediate a vast array of physiological traits, expressed differentially across many species in a given community. Through convergent evolution, molecules of keystone significance provide critical information to phylogenetically diverse species, initiate major trophic cascades, and structure communities within terrestrial, freshwater, coastal-ocean and open-ocean habitats.",https://openalex.org/W2105523233,e55c584d0f4edeccae1a066530a4b87056b6c7f3,0,True,0.9907702803611755,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/een.12436,The roles of history: age and prior exploitation in aquatic container habitats have immediate and carry‐over effects on mosquito life history,"1. Per‐capita resource availability in aquatic habitats is influenced directly by consumer density via resource competition and indirectly via delayed resource competition when temporally non‐overlapping cohorts of larvae exploit the same resources. In detritus‐based systems, resources are likely to be influenced by the age of the aquatic habitat, as detritus changes in quality over time and may be replenished by new inputs. 2. For aquatic insects that exploit detritus‐based habitats, feeding conditions experienced during immature stages can influence fitness directly via effects on development and survivorship, but also indirectly by influencing adult traits such as fecundity and longevity. 3. Larval habitat age and prior resource exploitation were manipulated in a field experiment using the container mosquito Aedes triseriatus. 4. It was found that A. triseriatus from older habitats had greater larval survival, faster development and greater adult longevity. Exploitation of larval habitats by a prior cohort of larvae had a significant negative effect on subsequent cohorts of larvae by delaying development. 5. It is suggested that extended conditioning of detritus probably resulted in conversion of recalcitrant resources to more available forms which improved the quality of the habitat. 6. In a parallel study, evidence was found of carry‐over effects of habitat age and prior exploitation on adult longevity for A. triseriatus and Aedes japonicus collected from unmanipulated aquatic habitats. 7. These results indicate the importance of detritus dynamics and the discontinuous nature of resource competition in these mosquito‐dominated aquatic systems.",https://openalex.org/W2728121544,1e6d474df510d8b1e9901c293acc7278df851286,0,True,0.9925884008407593,0
https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2015.1279,Dynamic resource allocation between pre- and postcopulatory episodes of sexual selection determines competitive fertilization success,"In polyandrous mating systems, male reproductive success depends on both mate-acquisition traits (precopulatory) and sperm competitive abilities (postcopulatory). Empirical data on the interaction between these traits are inconsistent; revealing positive, negative or no relationships. It is generally expected that the investment in pre- and postcopulatory traits is mediated by environmental conditions. To test how dietary resource availability affects sexual ornamentation, sperm quality and their interrelationship in three-spined sticklebacks ( Gasterosteus aculeatus ), full-sibling groups were raised under three conditions differing in food quantity and/or quality (i.e. carotenoid content): (i) high-quantity/high-quality, (ii) high-quantity/low-quality or (iii) low-quantity/low-quality. After 1 year of feeding, food-restricted males developed a more intense breeding coloration and faster sperm compared with their well-fed brothers, indicating that they allocated relatively more in pre- and postcopulatory traits. Moreover, they outcompeted their well-fed, carotenoid-supplemented brothers in sperm competition trials with equal numbers of competing sperm, suggesting that food-restricted males maximize their present reproductive success. This may result in reduced future reproductive opportunities as food-restricted males suffered from a higher mortality, had an overall reduced body size, and sperm number available for fertilization. In accordance with theory, a trade-off between the investment in pre- and postcopulatory traits was observed in food-restricted males, whereas well-fed males were able to allocate to both traits resulting in a significantly positive relationship.",https://openalex.org/W2227402218,6cd854c3e9ecdfbbeb8815a228be74010df223ec,0,True,0.9673606157302856,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2744,An experimental test of how parasites of predators can influence trophic cascades and ecosystem functioning,"Abstract Parasites can shape the structure and function of ecosystems by influencing both the density and traits of their hosts. Such changes in ecosystems are particularly likely when the host is a predator that mediates the dynamics of trophic cascades. Here, we experimentally tested how parasite load of a small predatory fish, the threespine stickleback, can affect the occurrence and strength of trophic cascades and ecosystem functioning. In a factorial mesocosm experiment, we manipulated the density of stickleback (low vs. high), and the level of parasite load (natural vs. reduced). In addition, we used two stickleback populations from different lineages: an eastern European lineage with a more pelagic phenotype (Lake Constance) and a western European lineage with a more benthic phenotype (Lake Geneva). We found that stickleback caused trophic cascades in the pelagic but not the benthic food chain. Evidence for pelagic trophic cascades was stronger in treatments where parasite load of stickleback was reduced with an antihelmintic medication, and where fish originated from Lake Constance (i.e., the more pelagic lineage). A structural equation model revealed that differences in stickleback lineage and parasite load were most likely to impact trophic cascades via changes in the composition, rather than overall biomass, of zooplankton communities. Overall, our results provide experimental evidence that parasites of predators can influence the cascading effects of fish on lower trophic levels with consequences on ecosystem functioning.",https://openalex.org/W2947555453,3fd7657b911e040c87a0e877ff49941130ba921b,0,True,0.9908548593521118,0

In response, marine reserves can be used to protect exploited species and conserve biodiversity. The increased abundance of predatory species in marine reserves may cause indirect effects along chains of multi-trophic interactions. These trophic cascades can arise through direct predation, density-mediated indirect interactions (DMIIs), or indirect behavioural effects, termed trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs). The extent of algal cover and the abundance of 4 primary consumers were determined in Lough Hyne, which was designated Europe’s first marine nature reserve in 1981. The primary consumers were the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, the topshell Gibbula cineraria, the oyster Anomia ephippium, and the scallop Chlamys varia. The abundances of 3 starfish species (Marthasterias glacialis, Asterias rubens, and Asterina gibbosa) were also determined, as were 2 potential crustacean predators, Necora puber and Carcinus maenas. These data were compared with historical data from a 1962 (prey) and a 1963 (predator) survey to determine the nature of community interactions over adjacent trophic levels. The present study reveals a breakdown in population structure of the 4 surveyed prey species. Marine reserve designation has led to an increase in predatory crabs and M. glacialis, a subsequent decrease in primary consumers, ­especially the herbivore P. lividus, and an increase in macroalgal cover which is indicative of a trophic cascade.

https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.06651,Pollinator competition and the structure of floral resources,"The mutualism between plants and pollinators is built upon the trophic ecology of flowers and florivores. Yet the ecology of flowers‐as‐food is left implicit in most studies of plant–pollinator ecology, and it has been largely neglected in mainstream trophic ecology. This deficit is especially evident in an emerging issue of basic and applied significance: competition between pollinators for floral resources. In this synthesis, we start by exploring the notion of floral resource limitation upon which most studies concerning competition between pollinators are tacitly predicated. Both theoretical and empirical lines of evidence indicate that floral resource limitation must be understood as a complex ecological contingency; the question is not simply whether but when, where and in what regions of floral trait space resources are limiting. Based on this premise, we propose a framework for understanding floral resource availability in terms of temporal, spatial and functional structure. While this framework is conceptually intuitive, it is empirically and analytically demanding. We review existing methods for measuring and summarizing the multi‐dimensional structure of floral resources, highlight their strengths and weaknesses, and identify opportunities for future methods development. We then discuss the causal relationships linking floral resource structure to species coexistence, plant–pollinator community dynamics, and exogenous drivers like climate, land use, and episodic disturbances. In its role as both cause and effect, floral resource structure mediates the relationship between behavioral ecology, landscape ecology, and coexistence theory with respect to flowers and florivores. Establishing floral resource structure as an object of study and application will both shed light on basic questions of coexistence and guide management decisions concerning contentious issues such as the compatibility of apiculture with wild pollinator conservation and the appropriate use of floral enhancements in agri‐environment schemes.",https://openalex.org/W4383816818,2ad3d02883d16d38404fc95e044dd72aa616222f,0,True,0.9688196182250977,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jeb.12381,Interactive effects of competition and social environment on the expression of sexual dimorphism,"Abstract The expression of sexual dimorphism is expected to be influenced by the acquisition of resources available to allocate to trait growth, combined with sex‐specific patterns of resource allocation. Resource acquisition in the wild may be mediated by a variety of ecological factors, such as the density of interspecific competitors. Allocation may in turn depend on social contexts, such as sex ratio, that alter the pay‐off for investment in sexual traits. How these factors interact to promote or constrain the expression and evolution of sexual dimorphism is poorly understood. We manipulated sex ratio and interspecific resource competition over the growing season of red‐spotted newts ( Notophthalmus viridescens ) in artificial ponds. Fish competitors had a stronger effect on female than male growth, which effectively eliminated the expression of sexual size dimorphism. In addition, newt sex ratio influenced fish growth, leading to reduction in fish mass with an increase in female newt frequency. Fish also reduced the expression of male tail height, a sexually selected trait, but only in tanks with a female‐biased sex ratio. This suggests males alter their resource allocation pattern in response to the strength of sexual selection. Our results demonstrate that ecologically and socially mediated interactions between sex‐specific resource acquisition and allocation can contribute to variation in the expression of sexual dimorphism.",https://openalex.org/W2156928578,f989fa88354772ecae806da7184042edeeafb7c3,0,True,0.9446123838424683,0
https://doi.org/10.1086/661926,Determinants of Northerly Range Limits along the Himalayan Bird Diversity Gradient,"The primary explanation for the latitudinal gradient in species diversity must lie in why species fail to expand ranges across different climatic regimes. Theories of species gradients based in niche conservatism assume that whole clades are confined to particular climatic regimes because the traits they share limit adaptation to alternative regimes. We assess these theories in an analysis of the twofold decline in bird species richness along the Himalayas from the southeast to the northwest. The presence of fewer species in the northwest is entirely due to a steep decline in the number of forest species; species occupying more open habitats show a reversed gradient. Forest species numbers are exceptionally high at midelevations (1,000-2,000 m) in the southeast, which experience a warm, wet climate not present in the northwest, and a high proportion of these species fail to expand their range to the northwest. Despite this, many species do have populations or close relatives that straddle different climatic regimes along altitudinal gradients and/or the regional gradient, implying that climate-based niche conservatism per se does not strongly constrain range limits. We argue that climate- and competition-mediated resource distributions are important in setting northerly range limits and show that one measure of forest resources (foliage density) is lower in the northwest.",https://openalex.org/W1975586176,c3f75b8948076bda5b711f8fae8fe6efe2472e7d,0,True,0.9436394572257996,0
https://doi.org/10.2307/3546993,Interspecific Competition between Two Stream Insect Grazers Mediated by Non-Feeding Predatory Fish,"Two periphyton-grazing stream insects, a baetid mayfly and a glossosomatid caddisfly, were found to be strong exploitative competitors. The presence of predatory fish was found to alter the foraging activities of the baetid. but not of the glossosomatid. We investigated the local distribution of Baetis thermicus and Glossosoma sp. to examine the potential for competition between the two grazers in a northern Japanese stream. Further, we carried our a laboratory experiment to test the hypothesis that the freshwater sculpin Cottus nozawae, when not allowed to attack prey, mediates the resource-limited competitive influences of Baetly on the growth of Glossosoma, but not the reverse. We found a negative correlation between the densities of Baetis and Glossosoma in the stream, suggesting the strong potential for resource-limiting competitive interactions to occur between the grazers. Using a laboratory channel experiment employing a target-neighbor design, neither the presence of sculpin nor the density of the two grazers altered any life-history traits measured for the grazers. However, the proportion of Baetis individuals positioned on the upper surface of a ceramic plate substrate (with greater periphyton biomass) largely decreased in the presence of sculpin, with only a minor behavioral shift being detected in Glossasoma. This difference in behavioral shift resulted in greater growth suppression in Baetis than in Glossosoma. In the absence of sculpin, growth of both target grazers was lowered by experimentally increasing the density of neighboring competitors. In partial contradiction to the above hypothesis, the growth of not only Glossosoma but also Baetis was never influenced by the density of neighbor competitors when sculpin were present. The biomass of periphyton in the presence of sculpin was greater than when sculpin were absent, and was lower with higher densities of either grazer. Predator-avoidance behavioral modifications in both grazers may be the mechanism responsible for mediation of their exploitative competition.",https://openalex.org/W2094194527,9e32e71c362c248080ece942274758836312c27a,0,True,0.9834142327308655,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.6648,Differences in prey personality mediate trophic cascades,"Abstract Functional trait approaches in ecology chiefly assume the mean trait value of a population adequately predicts the outcome of species interactions. Yet this assumption ignores substantial trait variation among individuals within a population, which can have a profound effect on community structure and function. We explored individual trait variation through the lens of animal personality to test whether among‐individual variation in prey behavior mediates trophic interactions. We quantified the structure of personalities within a population of generalist grasshoppers and examined, through a number of field and laboratory‐based experiments, how personality types could impact tri‐trophic interactions in a food chain. Unlike other studies of this nature, we used spatial habitat domains to evaluate how personality types mechanistically map to behaviors relevant in predator–prey dynamics and found shy and bold individuals differed in both their habitat use and foraging strategy under predation risk by a sit‐and‐wait spider predator. In the field‐based mesocosm portion of our study, we found experimental populations of personality types differed in their trophic impact, demonstrating that prey personality can mediate trophic cascades. We found no differences in respiration rates or body size between personality types used in the mesocosm experiment, indicating relative differences in trophic impact were not due to variation in prey physiology but rather variation in behavioral strategies. Our work demonstrates how embracing the complexity of individual trait variation can offer mechanistically richer understanding of the processes underlying trophic interactions.",https://openalex.org/W3049278712,216086285209e38b6976357b630832bdf75ab817,0,True,0.9979962706565857,0

Compounding effects of urbanization and introduced species on native bees are, however, unclear. Here, we investigated how honey bee abundance and foraging patterns related to those of native bee abundance and diversity in residential gardens and native vegetation remnants for 2 years in urbanized areas of the Southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot and assessed how niche overlap influenced these relationships. Honey bees did not overtly suppress native bee abundance; however, complex relationships emerged when analysing these relationships according to body size, time of day and floral resource levels. Native bee richness was positively correlated with overall honeybee abundance in the first year, but negatively correlated in the second year, and varied with body size. Native bees that had higher resource overlap with honey bees were negatively associated with honey bee abundance, and resource overlap between honey bees and native bees was higher in residential gardens. Relationships with honey bees varied between native bee taxa, reflecting adaptations to different flora, plus specialization. Thus, competition with introduced bees varies by species and location, mediated by dietary breadth and overlap and by other life-history traits of individual bee species.",https://openalex.org/W3144372724,b9fbe6b9bb823369f41fd85fcbbd833bc3d28513,0,True,0.9902270436286926,0
https://doi.org/10.1086/670821,Heterospecific Aggression and Dominance in a Guild of Coral-Feeding Fishes: The Roles of Dietary Ecology and Phylogeny,"Interspecific competition mediates biodiversity maintenance and is an important selective pressure for evolution. Competition is often conceptualized as being exploitative (indirect) or involving direct interference. However, most empirical studies are phenomenological, focusing on quantifying effects of density manipulations, and most competition theory has characterized exploitation competition systems. The effects on resource use of traits associated with direct, interference competition has received far less attention. Here we examine the relationships of dietary ecology and phylogeny to heterospecific aggression in a guild of corallivorous reef fishes. We find that, among chaetodontids (butterflyfishes), heterospecific aggression depends on a synergistic interaction of dietary overlap and specialization: aggression increases with dietary overlap for interactions between specialists but not for interactions involving generalists. Moreover, behavioral dominance is a monotonically increasing function of dietary specialization. The strong, positive relationship of dominance to specialization suggests that heterospecific aggression may contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity where it promotes resource partitioning. Additionally, we find strong phylogenetic signals in dietary overlap and specialization but not behavioral dominance. Our results support the use of phylogeny as a proxy for ecological similarity among butterflyfishes, but we find that direct measures of dietary overlap and specialization predict heterospecific agression much better than phylogeny.",https://openalex.org/W2025759680,4a9447cbd6713a0a8e2ff3531c504f178f9cd4a2,0,True,0.9797353148460388,0

To explore effects of habitat patchiness and variation in perceived risk of predation on food-web dynamics, we conducted a factorial experiment in a model aquatic food chain of predator−prey−resource using 2 contrasting predators (adult blue crab Callinectes sapidus and toad fish Opsanus tau), juvenile blue crab as prey, and mussel Geukensia demissa as resource. Both predator presence and habitat patchiness influenced the prey's preference for consuming resources at patch edges instead of interiors. The preference of prey for consuming resources at habitat edges was 4 times stronger in continuous oyster reef habitat than in smaller habitat patches. This suggests that interior resources in continuous habitat experience a refuge from consumption, but this refuge is largely lost in patchy habitat. The mere presence of predators reduced the prey's preference for consuming resources at habitat edges. This BMIE was significant for the ambush predator (toadfish) and the treatment containing both predators, but not for the actively hunting predator (adult blue crab). We conclude that habitat patchiness and predator presence can jointly affect resource distribution by inducing shifts in prey foraging behavior, revealing a need to incorporate BMIEs into habitat fragmentation studies. This conclusion has broad and growing relevance as anthropogenic factors increasingly modify predator abundances and fragment coastal habitats.

https://doi.org/10.3390/f10080609,Interactions between Climate and Nutrient Cycles on Forest Response to Global Change: The Role of Mixed Forests,"Forest ecosystems are undergoing unprecedented changes in environmental conditions due to global change impacts. Modification of global biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen, and the subsequent climate change are affecting forest functions at different scales, from physiology and growth of individual trees to cycling of nutrients. This review summarizes the present knowledge regarding the impact of global change on forest functioning not only with respect to climate change, which is the focus of most studies, but also the influence of altered nitrogen cycle and the interactions among them. The carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization effect on tree growth is expected to be constrained by nutrient imbalances resulting from high N deposition rates and the counteractive effect of increasing water deficit, which interact in a complex way. At the community level, responses to global change are modified by species interactions that may lead to competition for resources and/or relaxation due to facilitation and resource partitioning processes. Thus, some species mixtures can be more resistant to drought than their respective pure forests, albeit it depends on environmental conditions and species’ functional traits. Climate change and nitrogen deposition have additional impacts on litterfall dynamics, and subsequent decomposition and nutrient mineralization processes. Elemental ratios (i.e., stoichiometry) are associated with important ecosystem traits, including trees’ adaptability to stress or decomposition rates. As stoichiometry of different ecosystem components are also influenced by global change, nutrient cycling in forests will be altered too. Therefore, a re-assessment of traditional forest management is needed in order to cope with global change. Proposed silvicultural systems emphasize the key role of diversity to assure multiple ecosystem services, and special attention has been paid to mixed-species forests. Finally, a summary of the patterns and underlying mechanisms governing the relationships between diversity and different ecosystems functions, such as productivity and stability, is provided.",https://openalex.org/W2964016571,2d645df681aa29c9ba71ec7e78f0525bbf720555,0,True,0.976518452167511,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/imt2.194,Long‐term nitrogen input reduces soil bacterial network complexity by shifts in life history strategy in temperate grassland,"We investigated soil bacterial and fungal communities, constructed co-occurrence networks, and estimated bacterial traits along a gradient of nitrogen (N) input. The results showed that soil bacterial co-occurrence networks complexity decreased with increasing N input. The ratio of negative to positive cohesion decreased with increasing N input, suggesting the declined competitive but strengthened cooperative interactions. However, soil fungal network complexity did not change under N enrichment. In addition, N input stimulated the copiotroph/oligotroph ratio, ribosomal RNA operon (rrn) copy number, and guanine-cytosine (GC) content of soil bacteria, shifting bacterial life history strategy toward copiotroph with increased r-/K-strategy ratio. Piecewise structural equation modeling results further revealed that the reduction in bacterial co-occurrence network complexity was directly regulated by the increased bacterial r-/K-strategy ratio, rather than reduced bacterial richness. Our study reveals the mechanisms through which microbial traits regulate interactions and shape co-occurrence networks under global changes. Nitrogen (N) deposition induced by the emission of nitrogenous compounds from the combustion of fossil fuels and the application of N fertilizers has risen by 200% and is projected to double by 2050 in various regions worldwide [1]. The subsequent N enrichment poses serious threats to plant diversity, community, and the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, particularly grasslands [2]. Ecosystem function is associated with not only changes in plants but also the dynamics of soil microbes in response to N input [3]. Alterations in microbial populations can trigger changes in interactions among microorganisms, which play an important role in maintaining microbial network complexity, stability, and function [4]. Thus, understanding microbial co-occurrence and interaction is essential in the prediction of ecosystem processes and function in response to N enrichment in grassland ecosystems. Microbial interaction comprises cooperative and competitive components and generally links to richness. However, a few recent studies of N enrichment on microbial interactions have produced mixed results, irrespective of changes in microbial richness [5-7]. Specifically, some studies reported an increase in soil bacterial interactions and network complexity following N application, attributing to an increased number of keystone taxa [6]. Conversely, an investigation of a 150-year manipulative N application showed a significant reduction in the complexity of soil bacterial networks, coupling with a decline in cooperative relationships within communities [5]. Furthermore, one multilevel N application study indicated higher bacterial network complexity under lower N input but diminished complexity under higher N input with the same trend of cooperative relationships [7]. Across those studies, the responses of cooperative relationships to N input were found to align with alterations in bacterial network complexity. Different from the regulatory effect of cooperation on microbial network complexity, some community ecologists have proposed that the existence of competitive interaction facilitates high-order interaction and consequently enhances the complexity and stability of co-occurrence networks [4]. That said, the enhancement of competitive interactions contributes to microbial network complexity. Accordingly, the above observations of declined cooperation with simplified network complexity seem contradictory to this theoretical coexistence conceptual statement between positive (negative) interactions and complexity. Therefore, despite extensive investigations into microbial diversity and communities in grassland ecosystems globally, there is still a severe lack of information regarding how microbial interactions and network complexity respond to N enrichment and their underlying mechanisms. Here, we investigate microbial co-occurrence networks along a gradient of manipulative N input in a temperate grassland in China. This study aims to explore how soil microbial interactions respond to N input and elucidate the potential driving factors and mechanisms. We will address the following questions: (1) Whether the reduced microbial richness will lead to the diminution in microbial network complexity under N enrichment? (2) How do cooperative (competitive) interactions change in microbial network complexity in response to N enrichment? (3) Given that soil fungi are more closely connected to plants, will N input exert a more pronounced impact on fungal network complexity? The experimental site is located in the semiarid grassland of Duolun County, Inner Mongolia, China. A Latin square design was utilized since 2003, comprising a total 8 N application levels (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 g N m−2 y−1). Soil samples were collected in August 2016 and used for sequencing and chemical analyses (see Supporting Information: Methods). With increasing N input, there was a pronounced diminishing trend in the number of nodes and edges, average degree, clustering coefficient, and the first axis of principal component analysis (PC1) of bacterial network characteristics (Figure 1A,B and S1). Similar to topological parameters, the total, positive, negative cohesion, and negative/positive value of bacterial communities decreased with increasing N input (Figure 1C). However, N input did not alter soil fungal network complexity (Figure S2). The copiotroph/oligotroph ratio, ribosomal RNA operon (rrn) copy number, guanine-cytosine (GC) content, and the PC1 value representing the overall bacterial r-/K-strategy ratio gradually increased with the elevated N input (Figure 2A). Total cohesion exhibited a positive correlation with bacterial richness but a negative correlation with the r-/K-strategy ratio (Figure 2B). Piecewise structural equation modeling (SEM) results showed that N input, by increasing soil dissolved inorganic N content (DIN) and decreasing soil pH, altered the bacterial r-/K-strategy ratio. The bacterial r-/K-strategy ratio negatively affected bacterial richness. Total bacterial cohesion had a direct negative association with the r-/K-strategy ratio but had no association with bacterial richness (Figure 2C). In line with greater rrn copy number under high N conditions [8], we found that N input stimulated soil DIN and increased bacterial rrn copy number toward the copiotrophic community (Figure S3). We further found that GC content increased by N application. According to the rule of molecular biosynthesis, each GC at base pairs requires 8 N atoms while adenine-thymine (AT) at base pairs requires only 7 N atoms [9]. Therefore, the ""resource-driven selection"" theory proposes that N limitation is a strong selective force that causes the relatively low GC content [10, 11]. Consequently, the greater soil N would result in nucleotide sequences with G+C bias by alleviating N limitation. Different from the previous reports that GC content positively correlated with soil pH at a regional scale [11], GC content negatively related to soil pH in our study (Figure S4). This may be due to a decrease in soil pH caused by extra N application. Overall, a higher bacterial r-/K-strategy ratio indicates that bacterial life history strategy tends toward r-selection strategy. The stimulated r-/K-strategy ratio supports ""resource-driven selection"" in bacterial communities in response to N enrichment in the temperate grassland. The reduced bacterial network complexity under high N input was accompanied by a reduction in richness which was found in our previous work [12] and exhibited a positive correlation (Figure 2B). Note that we found that reduced richness was ascribed to the loss of oligotrophic taxa (Figure S5), which resulted in a shift in life history strategy. When controlling for the r-/K-strategy ratio, the partial correlation of total cohesion with richness is no longer significant (Figure 2B). Furthermore, the SEM results also revealed that bacterial community complexity was negatively associated with the r-/K-strategy ratio, implying that the tightness of bacterial connections was driven by life history strategies rather than bacterial richness (Figure 2B,C and S6). Oligotrophic taxa generally acquire nutrients or energy from various complex recalcitrant matter [13]. This acquisition process consists of multiple metabolic pathways involving various microorganisms, establishing more effective and stronger complex connections among microbial taxa [8]. However, N input stimulates plant growth and consequent fresh carbon inputs (Figure S7), producing sufficient energy supply and labile substrates [14]. The excessive N as well as substrate application facilitates copiotroph and promotes bacterial independence, weakening the complex connections and leading to less connectivity [5], thus simplifying co-occurrence networks. This finding that the r-/K-strategy ratio mediates bacterial co-occurrence network complexity points out the regulatory role of bacterial genetic and coding traits in taxa co-occurrence. We speculated that the reduced cohesion would be linked to the deconstruction of high-order interaction in a community. Interaction chains refer to the indirect impacts of one species on another through changes in the abundance of a third species beyond the pairwise interactions [15]. These emerged interaction chains can produce high-order interactions obtaining more diverse pairwise relationships and maintaining complex and robust co-occurrence networks [4]. The reduced cohesion and simplified bacterial co-occurrence network, in turn, to some degree, suggest the deconstruction of high-order interactions as well as a shift toward low-order interactions under N enrichment. The ratio between negative and positive cohesion represents the changes in competitive or cooperative strength. A higher ratio indicates greater competition among taxa within the community. Opposite to the increased negative/positive ratio in typical grassland [7], our results showed a decreased negative/positive cohesion ratio with increasing N input. This indicates a diminishment of competition and reinforcement of cooperation within the community. Specifically, extra N input directly alleviates the competition for nutrients and could weaken the competitive interactions [6]. In addition, the fast growth and metabolism within diverse taxa will produce metabolites to facilitate the exchange of energy and materials among taxa called cross-feeding to enhance cooperation [16]. Correspondingly, we found enhanced cooperation with an increased bacterial r-/K-strategy ratio (Figure S8). Moreover, certain competition can promote coexistence by equalizing the fitness of the other taxa within the community [17]. The loss of such competitors may lead to the subsequent loss of others and a simplified co-occurrence network [15]. The concurrent decreasing competitive interaction and simplified network emphasize the role of competition in maintaining species coexistence. The finding of unchanged soil fungal co-occurrence network complexity did not support our third hypothesis that soil fungi would be more responsive to N input. The unchanged co-occurrence network could be attributed to the physiological and morphological properties of soil fungi. Soil fungi generally have a great capacity to mineralize complex organic compounds for N [18]. Moreover, they also have high N use efficiency in biomass accumulation and a high C/N ratio [19]. Those two characteristics facilitate soil fungal growth under low N conditions with less dependence on extra N input, manifesting insensitive to N input. Furthermore, the thick cell walls and intrinsic spores exhibit high tolerance to soil acidification and metal toxicity [18], remaining stable under N enrichment. The feature of fungal mycelium enables it to penetrate and spread underground to establish a hyphal network [20]. Consequently, soil fungal hyphal network can extend over a wider spatial distribution and is therefore resistant to environmental change. In conclusion, our study demonstrates distinct patterns of changes in bacterial and fungal networks and interactions along the gradient of increasing N input in a temperate steppe. As N input increased, bacterial network complexity exhibited a downward trend, accompanied by a decline in the negative/positive cohesion ratio, while the network complexity of fungal communities remained unaltered. We further found that the decline in bacterial network complexity was driven by the increase in bacterial r-/K-strategy ratio under N enrichment. It is worth noting that this result is derived from a study over a decade of N input. Given the cumulative effect of N application over time, the temporal dynamics of soil bacterial network complexity in response to N input should be considered when extrapolating. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first empirical report that the reduced bacterial complexity is predominantly ascribed to the changes in bacterial life history strategy traits under N enrichment in grassland ecosystems. This finding provides insights into a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which microbial traits modulate co-occurrence networks and interactions in response to environmental changes.

We used nonlinear regression in a hypothesis-driven framework to quantify survival probability as a function of tree size, crown morphology, intraspecific competition and a growing season water balance. Extant spruce trees that persisted through the outbreak were spatially clustered, suggesting that survival was a non-random process. Larger diameter trees were more susceptible to bark beetles, reflecting either life history tradeoffs or a dynamic interaction between defense capacity and insect aggregation behavior. Competition had a strong negative effect on survival, presumably through resource limitation. Trees with more extensive crowns were buffered against bark beetles, ostensibly by a more robust photosynthetic capability and greater carbon reserves. The outbreak spanned a warming trend and conditions of anomalous aridity. Sustained water limitation during this period amplified the consequences of other factors, rendering even smaller trees vulnerable to colonization by insects. Our results are in agreement with prior research indicating that climate change has the potential to intensify bark beetle activity. However, forest outcomes will depend on complex cross-scale interactions between global climate trends and tree-level trait factors, as well as feedback effects associated with landscape patterns of stand structural diversity.",https://openalex.org/W4281761255,1a5aa643dc354fe90b110608fe19eafd24686831,0,True,0.9824569225311279,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.03165,Resource levels and prey state influence antipredator behavior and the strength of nonconsumptive predator effects,"The risk of predation can drive trophic cascades by causing prey to engage in antipredator behavior (e.g. reduced feeding), but these behaviors can be energetically costly for prey. The effects of predation risk on prey (nonconsumptive effects, NCEs) and emergent indirect effects on basal resources should therefore depend on the ecological context (e.g. resource abundance, prey state) in which prey manage growth/predation risk tradeoffs. Despite an abundance of behavioral research and theory examining state‐dependent responses to risk, there is a lack of empirical data on state‐dependent NCEs and their impact on community‐level processes. We used a rocky intertidal food chain to test model predictions for how resources levels and prey state (age/size) shape the magnitude of NCEs. Risk cues from predatory crabs Carcinus maenas caused juvenile and sub‐adult snails Nucella lapillus to increase their use of refuge habitats and decrease their growth and per capita foraging rates on barnacles Semibalanus balanoides. Increasing resource levels (high barnacle density) and prey state (sub‐adults) enhanced the strength of NCEs. Our results support predictions that NCEs will be stronger in resource‐rich systems that enhance prey state and suggest that the demographic composition of prey populations will influence the role of NCEs in trophic cascades. Contrary to theory, however, we found that resources and prey state had little to no effect on snails in the presence of predation risk. Rather, increases in NCE strength arose because of the strong positive effects of resources and prey state on prey foraging rates in the absence of risk. Hence, a common approach to estimating NCE strength – integrating measurements of prey traits with and without predation risk into a single metric – may mask the underlying mechanisms driving variation in the strength and relative importance of NCEs in ecological communities.",https://openalex.org/W2270179032,813d09e9c89cee9a421c39204a34a856e477cc7c,0,True,0.9858723878860474,0

There were no significant temporal peaks in the number of adult males or amplexed females observed along an 81-m transect of a small creek throughout a 3-mo study period. The nightly sex ratio was highly male biased. Over the study period, the distribution pattern of males showed a significant tendency toward clumping at oviposition sites (represented as oviposition sections of the creek where females laid eggs). During the nights, males usually showed a nonclumped distribution pattern along the transect, probably due to male-male interactions mediated through vocalization and physical combat, including vigorous biting. The calling sites of males were considered as breeding territories and sites of oviposition. Larger males often changed their nightly position along the transect, whereas smaller males remained at the same sites over the study period. The number of different oviposition sections in which each male was present over the study period ranged from 0–11 and was positively correlated with male body size. The number of matings by each male ranged from 0–9, and 42% of the males mated at least once. Male mating success was positively correlated with six male traits that included body size and the number of nights present. However, multivariate analysis revealed that a direct factor determining male mating success was the number of different oviposition sites which a male visited. This study also demonstrated that large-male mating advantage in L. kuhlii occurred indirectly through the size-dependent spatial movement pattern. A large body size in male L. kuhlii seems to have evolved through intrasexual selection (male-male competition by physical combat) in the context of a resource-defense polygyny mating system.",https://openalex.org/W2042869304,622113efd9063114a0b7fe1a76ee137ae134f4a5,0,True,0.9949287176132202,0

In particular, the effects of multiple fish predators on food webs are difficult to predict due to the prevalence of omnivory and intraguild predation. At the same time, many ecosystems experience high nutrient loads that fuel food webs from the bottom up. To test the combined effects of both multiple predators and nutrient enrichment on food web composition, we created monocultures of perch, roach, and stickleback as well as mixed assemblages of all 3 species at 3 different density levels using an additive design, and induced nutrient enrichment in half of the cages. The biomass of invertebrate herbivores and algae was measured. Stomach analyses of predators were used to detect prey switching. Herbivore biomass depended mainly on predator identity, while top-down effects on algae were mediated by predator density and nutrient enrichment. Specifically, perch strongly reduced amphipods and isopods, and roach mainly reduced gastropods but also isopods, while stickleback had weak overall effects on herbivores. These species-specific effects were attenuated in the mixed fish assemblages, probably due to prey switching. Algal growth strongly increased under high fish density and nutrient enrichment, but was not affected by predator-induced changes in the herbivore composition. This study shows that identity effects from predators in isolation are attenuated in multiple predator assemblages, probably due to increasing interference among the predators. Algal biomass was enhanced by nutrient enrichment and high predator density, which affected algae probably through non-lethal effects, such as reduced activity of the herbivores.

Resource availability can influence the structure of animal communities by mediating competitive interactions. An underappreciated aspect of resource ecology is how functional traits are built from particular sets of nutrients and thus are underexpressed when those nutrients are scarce. 2. One idea linking resource availability to competition is the metabolic fuel hypothesis, which posits that access to carbohydrate‐rich resources favours high activity rates that increase competitive prowess. One prediction of this hypothesis is that an increase in dietary carbohydrate richness will lead to an increase in consumer metabolic rate (MR). An alternative prediction is that carbohydrate‐rich diets will affect biochemical storage. 3. We tested these predictions by examining the effect of dietary protein : carbohydrate (P : C) ratio on the feeding behaviour, demography, physiology and MR of colonies of Ectatomma ruidum, a common tropical ant. We found that rearing colonies for 6 weeks on different P : C diets altered colony demography and worker storage biochemistry, but higher carbohydrate intake did not result in an increase in whole‐colony MR. 4. Our results suggest that dietary carbohydrates may increase colony dominance through changes in colony composition and individual worker longevity rather than changes in worker activity rates. More generally, they illustrate how the identity of scarce nutrients can have particular effects on traits that impact ecological interactions.",https://openalex.org/W1691639883,7e1878ef5524d9eca8b5aedbd0448780d08d5466,0,True,0.9915737509727478,0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029487,Selection against Accumulating Mutations in Niche-Preference Genes Can Drive Speciation,"Our current understanding of sympatric speciation is that it occurs primarily through disruptive selection on ecological genes driven by competition, followed by reproductive isolation through reinforcement-like selection against inferior intermediates/heterozygotes. Our evolutionary model of selection on resource recognition and preference traits suggests a new mechanism for sympatric speciation. We find speciation can occur in three phases. First a polymorphism of functionally different phenotypes is established through evolution of specialization. On the gene level, regulatory functions have evolved in which some alleles are conditionally switched off (i.e. are silent). These alleles accumulate harmful mutations that potentially may be expressed in offspring through recombination. Second mating associated with resource preference invades because harmful mutations in parents are not expressed in the offspring when mating assortatively, thereby dividing the population into two pre-zygotically isolated resource-specialist lineages. Third, silent alleles that evolved in phase one now accumulate deleterious mutations over the following generations in a Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller fashion, establishing a post-zygotic barrier to hybridization.",https://openalex.org/W2115242058,0e25a18b01af535f7a0fb2621719700201751362,0,True,0.9805545210838318,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.03157,Associational resistance or susceptibility: the indirect interaction between chemically‐defended and non‐defended herbivore prey via a shared predator,"Many organisms possess chemical defences against their natural enemies, which render them unpalatable or toxic when attacked or consumed. These chemically‐defended organisms commonly occur in communities with non‐ or less‐defended prey, leading to indirect interactions between prey species, mediated by natural enemies. Although the importance of enemy‐mediated indirect interactions have been well documented (e.g. apparent competition), how the presence of prey chemical defences may affect predation of non‐defended prey in terrestrial communities remains unclear. Here, an experimental approach was used to study the predator‐mediated indirect interaction between a chemically‐defended and non‐defended pest aphid species. Using laboratory‐based mesocosms, aphid community composition was manipulated to include chemically‐defended (CD) aphids Brevicoryne brassicae, non‐defended (ND) aphids Myzus persicae or a mixed assemblage of both species, on Brassica oleracea cabbage plants, in the presence or absence of a shared predator ( Chrysoperla carnea larvae). Aphid population growth rates, aphid distributions on host plants and predator growth rates were measured. In single‐species treatments, C. carnea reduced M. persicae population growth rate, but had no significant impact on B. brassicae population growth rate, suggesting B. brassicae chemical defences are effective against C. carnea. Chrysoperla carnea had no significant impact on either aphid species population growth rate in mixed‐species treatments. Myzus persicae (ND) therefore experienced reduced predation in the presence of B. brassicae (CD) through a predator‐mediated indirect effect. Moreover, predator growth rates were significantly higher in the M. persicae‐ only treatments than in either the B. brassicae‐ only or mixed‐species treatments, suggesting predation was impaired in the presence of B. brassicae (CD). A trait‐mediated indirect interaction is proposed, consistent with associational resistance, in which the predator, upon incidental consumption of chemically‐defended aphids is deterred from feeding, releasing non‐defended aphids from predatory control.",https://openalex.org/W2339739142,abf65e95003853c048d12910944671c3cfddb93f,0,True,0.9626783132553101,0
https://doi.org/10.1890/09-1912.1,Swimming performance trade-offs across a gradient in community composition in Trinidadian killifish (Rivulus hartii),"The impacts of predation and competition on life history, behavioral, and morphological traits are well established for many organisms, but effects on locomotor performance have received relatively little attention. We examined variation in sprint speed and critical swimming speed (Ucrit, a measure of stamina) in the Trinidadian killifish (Rivulus hartii) across a gradient of ecological communities. R. hartii are located in (1) ""high-predation"" sites with large, piscine piscivores, (2) ""Rivulus–guppy"" sites with guppies, and (3) ""Rivulus-only"" sites with only R. hartii. R. hartii suffer higher mortality in high-predation sites. In Rivulus–guppy sites, population densities are reduced and growth rates increased compared with Rivulus-only sites, which likely represent indirect effects of guppy predation on young R. hartii. We show a significant negative relationship, suggesting a trade-off, between sprint speed and endurance; Rivulus from high-predation sites were faster sprinters but had reduced critical swimming speeds. This trade-off was also apparent in correlations of the nine population means. At the individual level, the correlation was weaker and only significantly negative when all nine populations (three from each site) were pooled and values were not corrected for body size. Sex had a significant effect on Ucrit, with females having a lower Ucrit, but sexes did not differ in sprint speed. Fish from high-predation sites also exhibited increased tail lengths and fineness ratios compared to sites without large predators. The two low-predation sites showed no statistical differences in locomotor performance or morphology.",https://openalex.org/W2067819937,8873b0248987b996f848e628bf101882b527dd74,0,True,0.9896520376205444,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12592,New insights into plants co‐existence in species‐rich communities: The pollination interaction perspective,"Abstract Questions In animal‐mediated pollination, pollinators can be regarded as a limiting resource for which entomophilous plant species might interact to assure pollination, an event pivotal for their reproduction and population maintenance. At community level, spatially aggregated co‐flowering species can thus be expected to exhibit suitable suites of traits to avoid competition and ensure pollination. We explored the problem by answering the following questions: (1) are co‐flowering species specialized on different guilds of pollinators; (2) do co‐flowering pollinator‐sharing species segregate spatially; and (3) do co‐flowering pollinator‐sharing species that diverge in anther position spatially aggregate more than those that converge in anther position? Study Site Euganean Hills, NE Italy. Methods Plant composition, flowering phenology and interactions between each entomophilous plant species and pollinating insects were monitored every 15 days in 40 permanent plots placed in an area of 16 ha. We quantified the degree of flowering synchrony, pollinator‐sharing and spatial aggregation between each pair of entomophilous species. We then tested the relationship between the degree of co‐flowering, pollinator‐sharing and spatial aggregation, and between spatial aggregation and anther position. Results Entomophilous species converged, at least partially in flowering time, and the phenological synchronization of flowering was significantly associated with the sharing of pollinator guilds. Co‐flowering pollinator‐sharing species segregated spatially. Furthermore, co‐flowering pollinator‐sharing species that diverged in anther position aggregated more than those that converged in anther position. Conclusions Reproductive traits that facilitate the co‐existence of co‐flowering species include specialization on different pollinator guilds and a phenological displacement of the flowering time. Furthermore, in circumstances of increased competition due to phenological synchronization, pollinator‐sharing and spatial aggregation, the chance of effective pollination might depend on differences in anther position, resulting in a divergent pollen placement on pollinator bodies. One of the most interesting results we obtained is that the presence of one mechanism does not preclude the operation of others, and each plant species can simultaneously exhibit different strategies. Although more studies are needed, our results can provide additional information about plant–plant interactions and provide new insights into mechanisms allowing the co‐existence of a high number of plant species in local communities.",https://openalex.org/W2769050574,1d170d70531e12e5d937ada44ff61fe6e8a6fe72,0,True,0.9221890568733215,0
https://doi.org/10.1038/srep24369,Fine-scale behavioural differences distinguish resource use by ecomorphs in a closed ecosystem,"Temporal differences in habitat use and foraging specialisms between ecomorphs represent aspects of behavioural phenotype that are poorly understood with regard to the origin and maintenance of ecological diversity. We tested the role of behaviour in resource use divergence of two Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) phenotypes, a slim, putatively pelagic-dwelling morph and a robust, putatively littoral-dwelling generalist morph, over an annual cycle, using biotelemetry and stable isotopes. Pelagic morph charr exhibited significantly greater δC(13) depletion, concordant with increased zooplanktivory, than for the Littoral morph. Although three-dimensional space-use of the morphs strongly overlapped, on average, the Littoral morph used that habitat 19.3% more than the Pelagic morph. Pelagic morph fish were significantly more active, further from the lake bed and at greater depth than Littoral fish (annual means respectively, Pelagic, 0.069 BL s(-1), 8.21 m and 14.11 m; Littoral, 0.047 BL s(-1), 5.87 m and 10.47 m). Patterns of habitat use differed between ecomorphs at key times, such as during autumn and at ice break, likely related to spawning and resumption of intensive foraging respectively. Extensive space-use overlap, but fine-scale differences in habitat use between charr ecomorphs, suggests the importance of competition for generating and maintaining polymorphism, and its potential for promoting reproductive isolation and evolution in sympatry.",https://openalex.org/W2341967576,04aea2d671ba70122f0c2e0dde8c95e54b84608a,0,True,0.988627552986145,0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0055100,Restricting Prey Dispersal Can Overestimate the Importance of Predation in Trophic Cascades,"Predators can affect prey populations and, via trophic cascades, predators can indirectly impact resource populations (2 trophic levels below the predator) through consumption of prey (density-mediated indirect effects; DMIEs) and by inducing predator-avoidance behavior in prey (trait-mediated indirect effects; TMIEs). Prey often employ multiple predator-avoidance behaviors, such as dispersal or reduced foraging activity, but estimates of TMIEs are usually on individual behaviors. We assessed direct and indirect predator effects in a mesocosm experiment using a marine food chain consisting of a predator (toadfish--Opsanus tau), prey (mud crab--Panopeus herbstii) and resource (ribbed musse--Geukensia demissa). We measured dispersal and foraging activity of prey separately by manipulating both the presence and absence of the predator, and whether prey could or could not disperse into a predator-free area. Consumption of prey was 9 times greater when prey could not disperse, probably because mesocosm boundaries increased predator capture success. Although predator presence did not significantly affect the number of crabs that emigrated, the presence of a predator decreased resource consumption by prey, which resulted in fewer resources consumed for each prey that emigrated in the presence of a predator, and reduced the overall TMIE. When prey were unable to disperse, TMIEs on mussel survival were 3 times higher than the DMIEs. When prey were allowed to disperse, the TMIEs on resource survival increased to 11-times the DMIEs. We found that restricting the ability of prey to disperse, or focusing on only one predator-avoidance behavior, may be underestimating TMIEs. Our results indicate that the relative contribution of behavior and consumption in food chain dynamics will depend on which predator-avoidance behaviors are allowed to occur and measured.",https://openalex.org/W2035447577,66c7ab9ee7847ff0c5ce6704551cd33d7dc8afe6,0,True,0.9849004745483398,0
https://doi.org/10.1038/srep24021,Determinants of emigration and their impact on survival during dispersal in fox and jackal populations,"Abstract Animals disperse in response to poor resource conditions as a strategy of escaping harsh competition and stress, but may also disperse under good resource conditions, as these provide better chances of surviving dispersal and gaining fitness benefits such as avoiding kin competition and inbreeding. Individual traits should mediate the effect of resources, yielding a complex condition-dependent dispersal response. We investigated how experimental food reductions in a food-rich environment around poultry-growing villages interact with individual-traits (age, gender, body-mass) in two sympatric canids, red foxes and golden jackals, to jointly affect emigration propensity and survival during dispersal. Sub-adult foxes emigrated more frequently from the food-rich habitat than from the pristine, food-limited habitat, while adult foxes showed the opposite trend. During dispersal, adults exhibited lower survival while sub-adults did not experience additional mortality costs. Although fox mortality rates increased in response to food reduction, dispersal remained unchanged, while jackals showed strong dispersal response in two of the three repetitions. Jackal survival under food reduction was lowest for the dispersing individuals. While resources are an important dispersal determinant, different age classes and species experience the same resource environment differently and consequently have different motivations, yielding different dispersal responses and consequences.",https://openalex.org/W2316097479,38fcf6c1c4e6dbd1ef281434623a21e1bf901c95,0,True,0.9859412908554077,0
https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2007.1713,CD4 <sup>+</sup> T cells do not mediate within-host competition between genetically diverse malaria parasites,"Ecological interactions between microparasite populations in the same host are an important source of selection on pathogen traits such as virulence and drug resistance. In the rodent malaria model Plasmodium chabaudi in laboratory mice, parasites that are more virulent can competitively suppress less virulent parasites in mixed infections. There is evidence that some of this suppression is due to immune-mediated apparent competition, where an immune response elicited by one parasite population suppress the population density of another. This raises the question whether enhanced immunity following vaccination would intensify competitive interactions, thus strengthening selection for virulence in Plasmodium populations. Using the P. chabaudi model, we studied mixed infections of virulent and avirulent genotypes in CD4 + T cell-depleted mice. Enhanced efficacy of CD4 + T cell-dependent responses is the aim of several candidate malaria vaccines. We hypothesized that if immune-mediated interactions were involved in competition, removal of the CD4 + T cells would alleviate competitive suppression of the avirulent parasite. Instead, we found no alleviation of competition in the acute phase, and significant enhancement of competitive suppression after parasite densities had peaked. Thus, the host immune response may actually be alleviating other forms of competition, such as that over red blood cells. Our results suggest that the CD4 + -dependent immune response, and mechanisms that act to enhance it such as vaccination, may not have the undesirable affect of exacerbating within-host competition and hence the strength of this source of selection for virulence.",https://openalex.org/W1985950787,b4c6554fae236c260ee8ff8a0c08e0c59d39e649,0,True,0.9829645752906799,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.14770,"Tree, sex and size: Ecological determinants of male vs. female fecundity in three<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>stands","Abstract Interindividual variation in fecundities has major consequences on population evolutionary potential, through genetic drift and selection. Using two spatially explicit mating models that analyse the genotypes of seeds and seedlings, we investigated the variation of male and female fecundities within and among three European beech ( Fagus sylvatica ) stands situated along an altitudinal gradient. Female and male individual fecundity distributions were both skewed in this monoecious species, and we found a higher variance in female as compared to male fecundities. Both female and male fecundities increased with tree size and decreased with density and competition in the neighbourhood, the details of these effects suggesting sex‐specific strategies to deal with the impact of limited resource on fecundity. The studied populations were functionally male‐biased. Among‐individual variations in functional gender were not driven by tree size but by density and competition in the neighbourhood. Femaleness decreased under limited resource availability, an expected consequence of the higher cost of female reproduction. Considering the variation of gene flow and genetic drift across elevation, our results suggest that the adaptive potential could be enhanced by low genetic drift at low elevation, and by high pollen‐mediated gene flow at high elevation. Finally, this study predicts a more efficient response to selection for traits related to male vs. female fitness, for a given selection intensity.",https://openalex.org/W2841023601,49c1390f4001537dd9c1116be9018f1909b3f900,0,True,0.9749014973640442,0

In this review, we synthesize how the assembly and life-history composition of soil microbial communities influence the production of necromass and by-products that become SOM. Since SOM is the repository for SOC, we primarily discuss SOM but address SOM and SOC throughout. Recent insights into SOM chemistry via spectroscopy and microbial assembly via molecular analyses—much of which are context specific—have not been well integrated. We argue that it is essential to better merge these areas of research in order to guide cohesive development in SOC research. At a time of unprecedented global change, it is critical to have a solid conceptual basis upon which we can predict SOC responses to different global change scenarios. Fundamentally, microbial SOM formation is an outcome of microbial growth, which is frequently represented by growth rate and efficiency. Whole soil growth efficiency is primarily modeled as the proportion of C that is incorporated into biomass versus respiration (i.e., C use efficiency), with this value ranging between <0.1 and >0.9 for individual organisms and typically between 0.25 and 0.8 for whole communities depending on community structure, substrate type, and environmental conditions.25Manzoni S.

https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13935,Some neighbours are better than others: Variation in associational effects among plants in an old field community,"Abstract Consumer‐resource interactions are often influenced by other species in the community, such as when neighbouring plants increase or reduce herbivory to a focal plant species (known as associational effects). The many studies on associational effects between a focal plant and some neighbour have shown that these effects can vary greatly in strength and direction. But because almost all of these studies measure associational effects from only one or two neighbour species, we know little about the actual range of associational effects that a plant species might encounter in a natural setting. This makes it difficult to determine how important effects of neighbours are in real field settings, and how associational effects might interact with competition and other processes to influence plant community composition. In this study, we used a field experiment with a focal species, Solanum carolinense, and 11 common neighbour species to investigate how associational effects vary among many co‐occurring neighbour species and to test whether factors such as neighbour plant apparency, phylogenetic proximity to the focal species, or effects on focal plant defence traits help to explain interspecific variation in associational effect strength. We found that some neighbour species affected S. carolinense damage and attack by specialist herbivores, but associational effects of most neighbours were weak. Associational effects increased herbivore attack on average earlier in the season (associational susceptibility) and reduced herbivore attack on average later in the season (associational resistance) relative to S. carolinense in monoculture. We found some evidence that a neighbour's associational effect was related to its biomass and phylogenetic proximity to the focal species. While neighbour species differed in their effects on physical leaf traits of focal plants (trichome density, specific leaf area, and leaf toughness), these traits did not appear to mediate the effects of neighbours on focal plant herbivory. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the distribution of associational effect strengths in natural communities are similar to those observed for other interaction types, and that multiple mechanisms are likely acting simultaneously to shape associational effects of different neighbour species.",https://openalex.org/W4281624773,6873ec4c3e157bd89abd6f7810dc863436ab4ce0,0,True,0.9832955598831177,0
https://doi.org/10.1890/es15-00055.1,Color mimicry of empty seeds influences the probability of predation by birds,"Seeds are under strong pressure from seed predators. Therefore any physical seed trait increasing the chances of the seed's survival should undergo positive selection. Seed color polymorphism, varying from pale to dark seeds, occurs in Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris ), a keystone species of coniferous forests in Eurasia. This phenomenon can be explained by the production of large quantities of empty, always pale colored, seeds, with the opportunity for mimicry of these worthless seeds to avoid predation. Here, we investigated how the color of empty seeds may influence the foraging choices of the most common visual seed predator in temperate forests, the Chaffinch ( Fringilla coelebs ). We show, from field experiments, that different colored seed had different probabilities of predation by the chaffinch, and that predation was highest for dark seeds and lowest for pale empty seeds. Thus, the occurrence of empty seeds might benefit full seeds which mimic their coloration, even for those which are highly visible on the ground.

https://doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.21995,Ecological Interactions Involving Feral Horses and Predators: Review with Implications for Biodiversity Conservation,"ABSTRACT For many ecosystems, feral horses are increasingly becoming an important if not dominant component of ungulate biomass and hence influence on community dynamics. Yet we still know little of how horses contribute to key ecological interactions including predator‐prey and indirect competitive relationships at a community level. Notably, feral species like horses can exhibit life‐history traits that differ from that of native (mainly artiodactyl) herbivore competitors. Artificial selection for traits like increased, early, or extended reproduction that have yet to be reversed by natural selection, coupled with naturally selected differences in anatomy and behavior, in addition to unique management objectives for horses compared to other species, means that the dynamics of feral horse populations are not likely to align with what might be expected of other large herbivores. Unexpected population dynamics and inherent biological asymmetries between native ungulates and feral horses may therefore influence the former via direct competition for shared resources and through enemy‐mediated interactions like apparent competition. In several localities feral horses now co‐exist with multiple native prey species, some of which are in decline or are species at risk. Compounding risks to native species from direct or indirect competitive exclusion by horses is the unique nature and socio‐political context of feral horse management, which tends towards allowing horse populations to be limited largely by natural, density‐dependent factors. We summarize the inherent asymmetries between feral horse biology and that of other ungulate prey species with consequences for conservation, focusing on predator‐prey and emerging indirect interactions in multi‐prey systems, and highlight future directions to address key knowledge gaps in our understanding of how feral horses may now be contributing to the (re)structuring of food webs. Observations of patterns of rapid growth and decline, and associated skews in sex ratios of feral horse populations, indicate a heightened potential for indirect interactions among large ungulate prey species, where there is a prevalence of feral horses as preferred prey, particularly where native prey are declining. In places like western North America, we expect predator‐prey interactions involving feral horses to become an increasingly important factor in the conservation of wildlife. This applies not only to economically or culturally important game species but also at‐risk species, both predators (e.g., wolves [ Canis lupus ], grizzly bears [ Ursus arctos ]) and prey (e.g., woodland caribou [ Rangifer tarandus caribou ]), necessitating an ecological understanding of the role of horses in natural environments that goes beyond that of population control. © 2021 The Wildlife Society.",https://openalex.org/W3129160062,215afa1b006a0d6784ef7e370c68285ec2844b4a,0,True,0.990638256072998,0
https://doi.org/10.1890/07-1066.1,SEX-SPECIFIC EFFECTS OF ALBUMEN REMOVAL AND NEST ENVIRONMENT MANIPULATION ON BARN SWALLOW NESTLINGS,"In avian species, maternal provisioning to the eggs is predicted to be more valuable for the offspring under adverse environmental conditions and intense sibling competition. However, studies manipulating both the amount of maternal pre-hatching resources and the harshness of post-hatching environment have seldom been performed to date. In this experimental study of Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) nestlings, we tested the consequences of a reduction in the albumen content of the eggs for fitness-related offspring traits, while performing an unbalanced partial cross-fostering soon after hatching, either increasing or decreasing brood size by one nestling. By molecular sexing of the chicks, we additionally tested for sex-specific sensitivity of individual nestlings to experimental treatments and to sex ratio variation in nestmates. We predicted that chicks hatching from albumen-deprived eggs should suffer more than control chicks from the harsher rearing conditions of enlarged broods. However, although albumen removal depressed chick body mass, chicks hatching from control eggs did not fare better than those hatching from eggs with reduced albumen content in enlarged vs. reduced broods. Albumen removal had sex-specific effects on immunity, with males, but not females, hatching from eggs with reduced albumen content showing a lower T-cell-mediated immune response than controls, suggesting that the two sexes were differentially susceptible to resource deprivation during early ontogeny. In addition, both immune response and chick body mass at age 7 days, when maximum growth rate is attained, declined with an increasing proportion of male nestmates. The effect of brood size manipulation on chick body mass at age 12 days, when peak body mass is attained, was also found to depend on brood sex composition, in that an increase in the proportion of male nestmates depressed offspring body mass in reduced broods, while the reverse was true in enlarged broods. On the whole, these findings suggest that sex differences may exist in environmental sensitivity and patterns of resource allocation among different body functions, and that brood size variation and sex composition may affect offspring fitness-related traits.",https://openalex.org/W1970590127,d3c6d30687ec906726211d5841b27da9b955ecd7,0,True,0.9244107007980347,0

This study aims to understand the functional diversity of tree reproductive traits of sacred forest patches in an altered landscape. Twenty-five sacred groves in Palakkad region, Kerala, India, were chosen to assess the distribution of five reproductive traits – pollination mechanism, fruit size, seed number, seed size and dispersal mechanism – among the tree populations. The data matrix was analysed for overall trait-state distribution, functional diversity assessment and its relation to environmental parameters and disturbance in the area. A total of 87 woody species was documented with a fairly homogenized distribution of fruit and seed characters, with ≥50% of the recorded trait states in each grove in comparison to control plot. Pollination and dispersal mechanisms are dominated by a single guild. e.g. insects and birds, often generalist in nature. Functional richness had a strong correlation with Shannon's index and disturbance, but evenness and divergence were weakly related with others. Comparative assessment with null model showed no significant deviations from expected results indicating apparent lack of habitat filtering or resource competition among sacred groves. The trait homogenization and overall simplification of the grove biota is perhaps an outcome of rapid land-use change and its consequences on specialist members. This study shows sacred groves are important for maintaining a plethora of functional traits in the altered landscape. However, the prevalence of generalist mediators indicates maintenance of basic ecological functions in the landscape without support for specialist ones.",https://openalex.org/W2774492164,26f8fac2e01de8310fcce12af0a612a275ebf4a9,0,True,0.9389111995697021,0
https://doi.org/10.1086/700094,"Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics in Metacommunities: Ecological Inheritance, Helping within Species, and Harming between Species","Understanding selection on intra- and interspecific interactions that take place in dispersal-limited communities is a challenge for ecology and evolutionary biology. The problem is that local demographic stochasticity generates eco-evolutionary dynamics that are generally too complicated to make tractable analytical investigations. Here we circumvent this problem by approximating the selection gradient on a quantitative trait that influences local community dynamics, assuming that such dynamics are deterministic with a stable fixed point. The model nonetheless captures unavoidable kin selection effects arising from demographic stochasticity. Our approximation reveals that selection depends on how an individual expressing a trait change influences (1) its own fitness and the fitness of its current relatives and (2) the fitness of its downstream relatives through modifications of local ecological conditions (i.e., through ecological inheritance). Mathematically, the effects of ecological inheritance on selection are captured by dispersal-limited versions of press perturbations of community ecology. We use our approximation to investigate the evolution of helping within species and harming between species when these behaviors influence demography. We find that altruistic helping evolves more readily when intraspecific competition is for material resources rather than for space, because in this case the costs of kin competition tend to be paid by downstream relatives. Similarly, altruistic harming between species evolves when it alleviates downstream relatives from interspecific competition. Beyond these examples, our approximation can help better understand the influence of ecological inheritance on a variety of eco-evolutionary dynamics in metacommunities, from consumer-resource and predator-prey coevolution to selection on mating systems with demographic feedbacks.",https://openalex.org/W2950346381,445a60dea56420df4908ab75eddf3afcff8779d6,0,True,0.9423131942749023,0

These differences can result from interspecies competition leading to character shifts, a process referred to as character displacement. While character displacement is often interpreted as a consequence of genetically fixed trait differences between species, it can also be mediated by phenotypic plasticity in response to the presence of another species. Here, we test whether phenotypic plasticity leads to a shift in proteome allocation during co-occurrence of two bacterial species from the abundant, leaf-colonizing families Sphingomonadaceae and Rhizobiaceae in their natural habitat. Upon mono-colonizing of the phyllosphere, both species exhibit specific and shared protein functions indicating a niche overlap. During co-colonization, quantitative differences in the protein repertoire of both bacterial populations occur as a result of bacterial coexistence in planta. Specifically, the Sphingomonas strain produces enzymes for the metabolization of xylan, while the Rhizobium strain reprograms its metabolism to beta-oxidation of fatty acids fueled via the glyoxylate cycle and adapts its biotin acquisition. We demonstrate the conditional relevance of cross-species facilitation by mutagenesis leading to loss of fitness in competition in planta. Our results show that dynamic character displacement and niche facilitation mediated by phenotypic plasticity can contribute to species coexistence.",https://openalex.org/W4280488178,0250d8de5a0511b8e5f8f4625211ed02b4a6fbdc,0,True,0.9499406814575195,0

Such ecological specialization can promote the evolution of alternative ecomorphs-distinct phenotypes adapted for particular resources. Elucidating whether and how this process is influenced by sexual selection is crucial for understanding how ecological specialization promotes the evolution of novel traits and, potentially, speciation between ecomorphs. We evaluated the population-level effects of sexual selection (as mediated by mate choice) on ecological specialization in spadefoot toad tadpoles that express alternative ecomorphs. We manipulated whether sexual selection was present or reversed by mating females to their preferred versus non-preferred males, respectively. We then exposed their tadpoles to resource competition in experimental mesocosms. The resulting distribution of ecomorphs was similar between treatments, but sexual selection generated poorer trait integration in, and lower fitness of, the more specialized carnivore morph. Moreover, disruptive and directional natural selection were weaker in the sexual selection present treatment. Nevertheless, this effect on disruptive selection was smaller than previously documented effects of ecological opportunity and competitor density. Thus, sexual selection can inhibit adaptation to resource competition and thereby hinder ecological specialization, particularly when females obtain fitness benefits from mate choice that offset the cost of producing competitively inferior offspring.",https://openalex.org/W2050802356,f2195b9f7a4709140e6cefeb83d51b1269f9381d,0,True,0.988606870174408,0

However, it is not yet understood whether niche packing is facilitated by higher specialization and reduced niche overlap or, rather, by diffuse competition and increased niche overlap. We combined highly resolved bird-plant interaction networks, bird phylogenies, and plant functional traits to compare dietary niche overlap and foraging frequencies among frugivorous birds at seven sites in the tropical Andes. We quantified niche overlap on the basis of the traits of the plants used by each bird and related it to the degree of niche packing at the different sites. Niche complementarity decreased with increasing niche packing, suggesting that increasingly dense niche packing is facilitated by increased niche overlap. Pairwise niche overlap was mediated by shifts in foraging frequencies away from shared resources, and it decreased with decreasing phylogenetic relatedness and increasing dependence on fruit as resource. Our findings suggest that foraging choices are a key axis of diversification in frugivorous birds and that differences in resource use frequencies are already sufficient to reduce potential competition between ecologically similar species and facilitate niche packing, especially if species differ in their dependence on particular resources.",https://openalex.org/W4200039699,3d2cf3292a563761899a0c484869b72885bbecb0,0,True,0.9544066190719604,0

We investigated the effects of competition regime on the uptake of different N forms by two hygrophytes, Carex thunbergii and Polygonum criopolitanum, by conducting a hydroponic test of excised roots and an in situ experiment in a subtropical wetland ecosystem. The two species were grown either in monocultures or mixtures with various neighbor densities. Root functional traits and N uptake rates of different N forms were measured. Our results showed that N uptake was mainly determined by N form, rather than species identity. Both species were able to use organic N sources, but they took up relatively more N supplied as NO <mml:math xmlns:mml="" id=""INEQ1""><mml:msubsup><mml:mi /><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:math> than as NH <mml:math xmlns:mml="" id=""INEQ2""><mml:msubsup><mml:mi /><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:math> or glycine, irrespective of competition treatments.

The hydroponic test suggested that these divergences in N acquisition between two species might be partially explained by different root functional traits. To be specific, N uptake rates were significantly positively correlated with root N concentration and specific root length, but negatively correlated with root dry matter content. Our results implicated that C. thunbergii has a competitive advantage with relatively more stable N acquisition strategy despite a lower N recovery than P. criopolitanum, whereas P. criopolitanum could avoid competition with C. thunbergii via a better access to organic N sources, partly mediated by competition regimes.",https://openalex.org/W3112242358,1ca37a2a3ff3da1199d17847f1bca294d50c90e1,0,True,0.9141696095466614,0

However, it is still unclear how invasions may interact with local abiotic stressors, which are expected to increase as global change intensifies. Furthermore, we know little about the response to biological invasions of insects, despite their disproportionate contribution to global animal biodiversity. The aim of the present work is to investigate the impact of an invasive aquatic insect on the co‐occurrence patterns of native species of insects along a salinity gradient, and determine which assembly rules are driving these patterns. First, we characterised the habitat specialisation and functional niches of each species from physiological and biological traits, respectively, and their degree of overlap. Second, we used field data to compare the co‐occurrence patterns of native and invasive species in invaded and non‐invaded areas of southern Iberia and northern Morocco. Finally, we tested if habitat filtering or niche differentiation assembly rules mediate their co‐occurrence. In non‐invaded areas, habitat filtering drives habitat segregation of species along the salinity gradient, with a lower contribution of niche differentiation. The presence of the invasive insect modifies the distribution and co‐occurrence patterns of native species. In invaded areas, niche differentiation seems to be the main mechanism to avoid competition among the invasive and native species, enabling coexistence and resource partitioning. The combined study of functional niche similarity and abiotic stressor tolerance of invasive and native species can improve our understanding of the effects of invasive species along abiotic stress gradients. This approach may increase our capacity to predict the outcomes of biological invasion in a global change context.

https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.4145,Not attackable or not crackable—How pre‐ and post‐attack defenses with different competition costs affect prey coexistence and population dynamics,"It is well-known that prey species often face trade-offs between defense against predation and competitiveness, enabling predator-mediated coexistence. However, we lack an understanding of how the large variety of different defense traits with different competition costs affects coexistence and population dynamics. Our study focusses on two general defense mechanisms, that is, pre-attack (e.g., camouflage) and post-attack defenses (e.g., weaponry) that act at different phases of the predator-prey interaction. We consider a food web model with one predator, two prey types and one resource. One prey type is undefended, while the other one is pre- or post-attack defended paying costs either by a higher half-saturation constant for resource uptake or a lower maximum growth rate. We show that post-attack defenses promote prey coexistence and stabilize the population dynamics more strongly than pre-attack defenses by interfering with the predator's functional response: Because the predator spends time handling ""noncrackable"" prey, the undefended prey is indirectly facilitated. A high half-saturation constant as defense costs promotes coexistence more and stabilizes the dynamics less than a low maximum growth rate. The former imposes high costs at low resource concentrations but allows for temporally high growth rates at predator-induced resource peaks preventing the extinction of the defended prey. We evaluate the effects of the different defense mechanisms and costs on coexistence under different enrichment levels in order to vary the importance of bottom-up and top-down control of the prey community.",https://openalex.org/W2808591369,bea47f077d74ff393efb0f398b5af02f31ca75e8,0,True,0.9008795022964478,0

With their activity diazotrophs support biological production by fixing about 100–200 Tg N/year and turning otherwise unavailable dinitrogen into bioavailable nitrogen (N), an essential limiting nutrient. Despite their important role, the factors that control the distribution of diazotrophs and their ability to fix N 2 are not fully elucidated. We discuss insights that can be gained from the emerging picture of a wide geographical distribution of marine diazotrophs and provide a critical assessment of environmental (bottom-up) versus trophic (top-down) controls. We expand a simplified theoretical framework to understand how top-down control affects competition for resources that determine ecological niches. Selective mortality, mediated by grazing or viral-lysis, on non-fixing phytoplankton is identified as a critical process that can broaden the ability of diazotrophs to compete for resources in top-down controlled systems and explain an expanded ecological niche for diazotrophs. Our simplified analysis predicts a larger importance of top-down control on competition patterns as resource levels increase. As grazing controls the faster growing phytoplankton, coexistence of the slower growing diazotrophs can be established. However, these predictions require corroboration by experimental and field data, together with the identification of specific traits of organisms and associated trade-offs related to selective top-down control. Elucidation of these factors could greatly improve our predictive capability for patterns and rates of marine N 2 fixation. The susceptibility of this key biogeochemical process to future changes may not only be determined by changes in environmental conditions but also via changes in the ecological interactions.",https://openalex.org/W3195391895,a596052b50bf8d418112e228dc407db4057eea06,0,True,0.9266619086265564,0

Interactions between plants vary in space, over time and with organisational complexity. Yet it is challenging to quantify temporal, spatial and functional determinants of different types of interactions between long‐lived perennial plant species and their effect on lifetime fecundity. We studied how plant–plant, pollinator‐ and seed predator‐mediated interactions affect year‐to‐year variation in three fecundity components (cone production, seed set and seed survival) during post‐fire recovery. Age‐stratified data on the three fecundity components were collected in 19 even‐aged communities comprising 20 serotinous Protea shrub species in the South African Fynbos. We analyse data on these fecundity components with neighbourhood models to infer the sign and strength of interactions throughout post‐disturbance recovery, the neighbour plant traits that shape them and the spatial scale at which interactions take place. For each fecundity component, these models describe how neighbourhood effects change over time and with spatial distance between plants. We then predicted neighbourhood effects on individual fecundity components and cumulative reproductive output at different post‐fire stand ages for each focal plant. Competitive effects on cone production and seed set increased with post‐fire stand age as biomass and floral resources for pollinators build up. In contrast, neighbourhood effects on seed survival were weak throughout post‐disturbance recovery. Plant–plant interactions were shaped by neighbour traits related to resource acquisition, whereas animal‐mediated interactions depended on neighbour traits related to resource availability for pollinators and seed predators. The spatial scale of the interactions increased from plant–plant over predator‐mediated to pollinator‐mediated interactions. The joint effect of these interactions on cumulative reproductive output caused the proportion of focal plants experiencing competition to increase with time since fire. Synthesis. We show that temporal changes in biotic interactions throughout post‐disturbance recovery of perennial plant communities depend on functional traits and can be integrated into neighbourhood effects on lifetime fecundity. Studying the temporal, spatial and functional determinants of neighbourhood effects on lifetime fecundity is important for predicting not only individual plant fitness but also population and community dynamics in changing environments.",https://openalex.org/W4306407789,c49bf90644418fb49572a8c04da4fb4637c3150f,0,True,0.9545591473579407,0

A key mediator of trophic cascades is body mass, as it both strongly influences and evolves in response to predator–prey interactions. Here, we use Gillespie eco-evolutionary models to explore EETCs resulting from top predator loss and mediated by body mass evolution. Our four-trophic-level food chain model uses allometric scaling to link body mass to different functions (ecological pleiotropy) and is realistically parameterized from the FORAGE database to mimic the parameter space of a typical freshwater system. To track real-time changes in selective pressures, we also calculated fitness gradients for each trophic level. As predicted, top predator loss generated alternating shifts in abundance across trophic levels, and, depending on the nature and strength in changes to fitness gradients, also altered trajectories of body mass evolution. Although more distantly linked, changes in the abundance of top predators still affected the eco-evolutionary dynamics of the basal producers, in part because of their relatively short generation times. Overall, our results suggest that impacts on top predators can set off transient EETCs with the potential for widespread indirect impacts on food webs.",https://openalex.org/W3097257102,d5a70511cc73c4baae1421ac3d83a0a5fad6c34f,0,True,0.9955147504806519,0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090507,Biophysical Interactions Control the Size and Abundance of Large Phytoplankton Chains at the Ushant Tidal Front,"Phytoplankton blooms are usually dominated by chain-forming diatom species that can alter food pathways from primary producers to predators by reducing the interactions between intermediate trophic levels. The food-web modifications are determined by the length of the chains; however, the estimation is biased because traditional sampling strategies damage the chains and, therefore, change the phytoplankton size structure. Sedimentological studies around oceanic fronts have shown high concentrations of giant diatom mats (>1 cm in length), suggesting that the size of diatom chains is underestimated in the pelagic realm. Here, we investigate the variability in size and abundance of phytoplankton chains at the Ushant tidal front (NW France) using the Video Fluorescence Analyzer (VFA), a novel and non-invasive system. CTD and Scanfish profiling characterized a strong temperature and chlorophyll front, separating mixed coastal waters from the oceanic-stratified domain. In order to elucidate spring-neap variations in the front, vertical microstructure profiler was used to estimate the turbulence and vertical nitrate flux. Key findings were: (1) the VFA system recorded large diatom chains up to 10.7 mm in length; (2) chains were mainly distributed in the frontal region, with maximum values above the pycnocline in coincidence with the maximum chlorophyll; (3) the diapycnal fluxes of nitrate enabled the maintenance of the bloom in the frontal area throughout the spring-neap tidal cycle; (4) from spring to neap tide the chains length was significantly reduced; (5) during neap tide, the less intense vertical diffusion of nutrients, as well as the lower turbulence around the chains, intensified nutrient-depleted conditions and, thus, very large chains became disadvantageous. To explain this pattern, we suggest that size plasticity is an important ecological trait driving phytoplankton species competition.

The wide range of natural enemies of aphids, that are commercially available, is not a guarantee for successful control but rather an indication that this problem is difficult to tackle. Strategies for control vary among organic growers and it is still not known which natural enemy complexes give the best results. When releasing natural enemies for aphid control, it is important to consider the possible interactions with other pest species and natural enemies present. Within man-made natural enemy communities for multiple pest control, direct and indirect interactions occur which can enhance or disrupt biological control, such as predators eating other predators, behavioural changes, plant responses or apparent competition. Here we investigated the effects of the generalist predatory bugs Orius laevigatus and Orius majusculus on biological control of green peach aphids, Myzus persicae, by the predatory midge Aphidoletes aphidimyza in the absence or presence of thrips. Our results showed that intraguild predation of aphidophageous midges by generalist predatory bugs is a realistic phenomenon, but the risk of disruption of aphid control seems to be limited. The addition of thrips and O. majusculus to predatory midges even enhanced the suppression of aphids. We conclude that a broad system view with predator-prey complexes is required for identifying successful natural enemy complexes for aphid control. INTRODUCTION Aphids are the most destructive pest species in organically grown sweet peppers. The green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), especially the red phenotype, is notorious for its fast reproduction and tendency to colonize flowers and young leaves. This behaviour directly results in reduction in growth of the plant and fruit production. Moreover, the honeydew secreted by these aphids pollutes leaves and fruit, which consequently facilitates growth of sooty mould. Another damaging aphid species in sweet pepper is the foxglove aphid, Aulacorthum solani (Kaltenbach). This species typically induces strong plant responses such as yellow necrotic spots and leaf deformation, which can occur at low aphid densities. At higher densities, aphid-induced damage can result in leaf drop. Biological control of these aphids is mainly based on weekly releases of the parasitoids, Aphidius colemani Viereck and Aphidius ervi Haliday, and the predatory midge, Aphidoletes aphidimyza (Rondani). Additionally, growers release the slower reproducing wasps Aphelinus abdominalis (Dalman) and chrysopid, syrphid or coccinellid predators. Despite releases of mulitple natural enemies, biocontrol programs often do not succeed. One reason could be that these natural enemies interact with biocontrol agents that are released to control other pest species, such as generalist predatory mites and predatory bugs for the control of thrips. We recently showed that predatory mites strongly disrupt the biological control of aphids using the predatory midge, A. aphidimyza, because of hyperpredation of the midge eggs (Messelink et al., a Gerben.messelink@wur.nl Proc. First IC on Organic Greenhouse Hort. Eds.: M. Dorais and S.D. Bishop Acta Hort. 915, ISHS 2011 172 2011). Another threat for predatory midges could be the predation by generalist Orius bugs, which are mainly used for controlling thrips. These predators are known to feed not only on thrips, but also on aphids and the aphidophagous predator A. aphidimyza (Christensen et al., 2002). Such interactions have been referred to as intraguild predation (Fig. 1), which occurs when one predator species (the intraguild predator) kills and eats another predator species (the intraguild prey) with whom it also competes for shared prey (Polis et al., 1989; Holt and Polis, 1997). In theory, intraguild predation can disrupt biological control (Rosenheim et al., 1995), but in practice, results are mixed (Janssen et al., 2006, 2007; Vance-Chalcraft et al., 2007). Here we examine the effects of Orius laevigatus (Fieber) and Orius majusculus (Reuter) on the biological control of aphids with predatory midges in the presence of thrips as an alternative prey for Orius. Furthermore, we discuss the role of species interactions in developing management strategies for aphid control in sweet pepper. MATERIALS AND METHODS Rearing Sweet pepper plants, Capsicum annuum L. ‘Ferrari’ (Enza Zaden), were grown in rockwool blocks in a greenhouse compartment. We used the red phenotype of the green peach aphid, M. persicae, which was cultured on sweet pepper plants. Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), were cultured on flowering chrysanthemum plants, ‘Mirimar’. The predatory midge, A. aphidimyza, and predatory bug, O. laevigatus (Fieber), were obtained from Koppert Biological Systems (Berkel en Rodenrijs, The Netherlands), whereas the predatory bug, O. majusculus, was obtained from Biobest NV (Westerlo, Belgium). Greenhouse Experiment A cage experiment was carried out to assess the effects of predatory bugs on the suppression of aphids, in the presence of the predatory midge A. aphidimyza. Thrips were introduced to a subset of cages to provide an alternative prey for the predatory bugs. Individual flowering sweet pepper plants, ca. height 30 cm with 15–17 leaves, were put into a single cage (diameter 30 cm, height 40 cm, top with side-openings covered with insect gauze). Cages were placed on tables and maintained, at an average of 21°C, in one greenhouse compartment. The lower plant stem and roots in rockwool extended through a sealed hole at the bottom of the cages in order to allow automatic supply of a standard nutrient solution with an ebb-and-flow system. There were 8 treatments, with 4 replicates per treatment: (1) aphids only, (2) aphids + O. laevigatus + thrips, (3) aphids + O. majusculus + thrips, (4) aphids + A. aphidimyza, (5) aphids + A. aphidimyza + O. laevigatus, (6) aphids + A. aphidimyza + O. majusculus, (7) aphids + A. aphidimyza + O. laevigatus + thrips and (8) aphids + A. aphidimyza + O. majusculus + thrips. Each plant was infected with 20 aphids of mixed age, which were collected with a fine brush from the culture on sweet pepper. Adult thrips were introduced three times in the destined treatments in densities of 20, 20 and 40 females per plant after 1, 11 and 23 days post aphid release, respectively. Repeated releases of thrips were necessary because thrips proved to be controlled effectively. The predatory midge A. aphidimyza was introduced 10 days after aphid release by adding 10 pupae per cage in humid vermiculite. The adult midges emerged within 4 to 7 days, and no mortality of pupae was observed. Ten adult female predatory bugs were introduced 17 days after aphid release in each cage. The densities of all insects were assessed once, 28 days after aphid release, by checking all parts of each plant under a stereomicroscope (40x). For statistical analyses, we performed a standard ANOVA on the log transformed densities of insects. Differences among treatments were tested at the 5% level using Fisher’s Least Significant Difference (LSD) method.",https://openalex.org/W1597064921,a780e384f86b9acfbda972119bbe26d99fbe996a,0,True,0.9280621409416199,0

However, few microbial ecological models address this trait, particularly concerning multiple enzyme functional groups that regulate complex biogeochemical processes. Here, we aim to fill this gap by developing a COmpetitive Dynamic Enzyme ALlocation (CODEAL) scheme for six enzyme groups that act as indicators of inorganic nitrogen (N) transformations in the Microbial-ENzyme Decomposition (MEND) model. This allocation scheme employs time-variant allocation coefficients for each enzyme group, fostering mutual competition among the multiple groups. We show that the principle of enzyme cost minimization is achieved by using the substrate's saturation level as the factor for enzyme allocation, resulting in an enzyme-efficient pathway with minimal enzyme cost per unit metabolic flux. It suggests that the relative substrate availability affects the trade-off between enzyme production and metabolic flux. Our research has the potential to give insights into the nuanced dynamics of the N cycle and inspire the evolving landscape of enzyme-mediated biogeochemical processes in microbial ecological modeling, which is gaining increasing attention.",https://openalex.org/W4388821973,36b82a6cb9432c6a09c727a4ff606d3e16673c37,0,True,0.9315507411956787,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9599,Can diet niche partitioning enhance sexual dimorphism?,"Classic evolutionary theory suggests that sexual dimorphism evolves primarily via sexual and fecundity selection. However, theory and evidence are beginning to accumulate suggesting that resource competition can drive the evolution of sexual dimorphism, via ecological character displacement between sexes. A key prediction of this hypothesis is that the extent of ecological divergence between sexes will be associated with the extent of sexual dimorphism. As the stable isotope ratios of animal tissues provide a quantitative measure of various aspects of ecology, we carried out a meta-analysis examining associations between the extent of isotopic divergence between sexes and the extent of body size dimorphism. Our models demonstrate that large amounts of between-study variation in isotopic (ecological) divergence between sexes is nonrandom and may be associated with the traits of study subjects. We, therefore, completed meta-regressions to examine whether the extent of isotopic divergence between sexes is associated with the extent of sexual size dimorphism. We found modest but significantly positive associations across species between size dimorphism and ecological differences between sexes, that increased in strength when the ecological opportunity for dietary divergence between sexes was greatest. Our results, therefore, provide further evidence that ecologically mediated selection, not directly related to reproduction, can contribute to the evolution of sexual dimorphism.",https://openalex.org/W4311874724,bfcedba3b5206806d8309c4b206d4cfa408a0c0c,0,True,0.9885498285293579,0

Competitive species must partition their ecological niches for sympatry, while the extent of niche overlaps is mediated by either the ecological traits (e.g., body size differences) or environmental features. We aimed to elucidate the patterns of spatial and temporal niche overlaps in mesocarnivore guilds, which are mediated by their ecological traits, regional environments, and anthropogenic disturbances. We investigated the spatial occurrence and diel activities of six mesocarnivore species and estimated their spatial and temporal overlap indices in various landscapes with different anthropogenic disturbances in central Bulgaria. Statistical modeling demonstrated that spatial overlap among mesocarnivores declined when mesocarnivore pairs were within the same family and when large carnivores (particularly wolves, Canis lupus) were present. Furthermore, we found that the extent of their temporal overlaps was associated with taxonomic and body size differences in mesocarnivore pairs as well as their trophic competitions. Our findings indicated that the intensity of interferences among mesocarnivore species was key for the decline of spatial or temporal niche overlap to relax antagonistic interactions.",https://openalex.org/W4407108510,3003361b35e6ec7695f569a88a2848e7f2de1a17,0,True,0.9901580810546875,0
https://doi.org/10.1163/156853907779947328,Carotenoid-based plumage coloration and aggression during molt in male house finches,"Abstract Birds often use colorful traits to mediate resource competitions, and typically individuals with bright or large patches of color are more competitive than or dominant to those with drab or small color patches. Male House Finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) are an exception, however, as drab males tend to be more aggressive than bright males during the breeding season and in winter. One hypothesis for this 'negatively correlated handicap' is that drab male house finches, being comparatively sexually unattractive and in poor health and condition, have more to gain by elevating aggression and increasing access to food and pursuit of (especially extra-pair) mates. It would seem important then to test this hypothesis during the period of molt, when birds are actively acquiring the foods and carotenoid pigments that make them colorful and a time in which there is a clear link between plumage color and nutrition/health in this species. We conducted two captive dominance experiments with male House Finches from the southwestern United States (their native range) to examine the relationship between carotenoid-based plumage coloration and aggression during molt. In the first experiment, where birds exhibited their natural, currently growing plumage color, we found that drab males were significantly more aggressive than bright males. However, when plumage colors were manipulated with art markers in a second experiment, color display was no longer significantly predictive of agonistic outcomes. These results suggest that: (1) drab male dominance is not an artifact in eastern US populations and instead is a conserved property of native and non-native House Finches, (2) like in our previous studies in winter, plumage color is correlated with dominance but does not serve as a visual signal of social status in this species, and (3) drab males should have a competitive advantage over access to important carotenoid-rich foods during molt, but apparently do not become as colorful because they do not adequately locate carotenoid-rich foods or do not use them efficiently for energetic or health reasons, which are perhaps exacerbated by elevated testosterone levels.",https://openalex.org/W2130091591,346c43aaf985528c038508e7cdf3b8de06e6d8b7,0,True,0.9747002720832825,0

For example, genetic variation in an herbivore could alter plant responses that then influence other plant‐associated arthropods. However, few systems have experimentally tested the ecological consequences of genetic variation as mediated through other species, especially within the same trophic community context. I studied how evolution of feeding preference in the willow leaf beetle ( P lagiodera versicolora ), which occurs under selection in a herbivore community context, feeds back to an arthropod community through plant‐mediated indirect interactions. Previous studies show beetle populations locally adapt distinct preferences ranging from the gourmet‐type, which feeds exclusively on new leaves of willows, to the no‐preference (no‐pref) type, which displays non‐preferential feeding on leaves of different ages. I conducted field experiments at two sites that mimicked evolutionary changes in the feeding preference of the leaf beetle. I manipulated the composition of leaf beetle feeding types for 6 days in spring and then investigated subsequent development of arthropod communities. I found that initial herbivory by a higher proportion of gourmet‐type beetles led to lower subsequent abundance of conspecific beetle larvae. In contrast, a higher proportion of gourmet‐type beetles resulted in higher abundance of aphids. Aphid‐tending ants also increased with the increasing abundance of aphids. As a result, species diversity of arthropod communities decreased with the proportion of gourmet‐type beetles in the initial beetle treatment. Community assembly dynamics were significantly influenced by interactive effects between the initial beetle treatment and subsequent colonizer species identities. Thus, beetle genetic variation had long‐lasting effects through a temporal chain of indirect interactions likely mediated through induced plant responses and the abundance of aphids. Synthesis. Evolutionary changes in feeding traits within an herbivore species had profound but predictable impact on local arthropod communities. Because the feeding evolution of herbivores nearly always occurs in a community context, plant‐mediated feedback loops between the evolution and ecological community of arthropods may be widespread in nature.",https://openalex.org/W1964110385,3796d5ae5bb4c2158a024acbcd1c2c6889d8bbab,0,True,0.9948727488517761,0

Spotless starling males ( Sturnus unicolor ) carry green plants into their nests before egg laying, and recent studies have shown that this behaviour is related to female breeding decisions and the production of male‐biased broods. Although the functional implications of this effect on females are not yet clear, data suggest that it could be mediated by female circulating hormones. Additionally, females may show higher androgen levels as a consequence of the increased female–female competition generated by the increase in male attractiveness. We tested this hypothesis using the same manipulation of green nesting material that has been previously shown to result in an increase of male attractiveness in male spotless starlings. We found that females in experimental nests increased their circulating testosterone levels during the laying period. In addition, there was an increase of social interferences in the experimental nests because of the addition of green plants. We hypothesise that testosterone may allow females to maintain their mating status when competing with other females for the preferred males. Addition of green plants also increased the variance in the levels of circulating testosterone, suggesting plasticity between females in their response to the manipulation. We propose that there is a functional link between high testosterone levels, male‐biased sex ratios and female resource‐holding potential in intra‐sexual competition in this species.",https://openalex.org/W2153913015,8af867ffbb9a20ec6bc2ba82abeff3b70883c07c,0,True,0.9011948704719543,0

Utilizing morphological, genetic, and stable isotope techniques, we found no evidence of discrete trophic morphotypes as previously described, but instead found evidence for an ontogenetic diet shift. Carbon and nitrogen isotope data indicate a 40% decrease in the proportion of benthic feeding and an increase of one trophic position over the size and age ranges of adult kokanee, corresponding to a diet shift from consumption of macroinvertebrates in smaller individuals to piscivory in larger individuals. This novel piscivory in kokanee may result from predatory and competitive freedom resulting from the lack of limnetic predators in Jo-Jo Lake. Piscivorous feeding despite a phenotype–environment mismatch has resulted in large, piscivorous kokanee having up to 70% of their gill rakers damaged. Observed reductions in gill raker number relative to the putative ancestral population are convergent with expectations for piscivorous fishes, despite a presumed lack of standing genetic variation for piscivory in the sockeye salmon – kokanee species complex. Jo-Jo Lake kokanee are a distinctive example of adaptation in salmonids in response to ecological release.

IMPLICATIONS FOR LOCAL COEXISTENCE,"Flowering time in plants is a highly variable trait that influences species' resource use and exchange of pollen with con- and heterospecifics. Levin (2009) suggested that habitat shifts within species might cause plastic shifts in flowering phenology, reducing pollen exchange across habitats. Coupled with divergent selection across habitats, diverged flowering time might thus pave the way towards ecological speciation. Some of these ideas may apply across species as well. If close heterospecific relatives share phylogenetically conserved flowering times and negatively affect each other's fitness, habitat shifts to microallopatry might provide a means for local coexistence by close relatives by reducing resource competition, shared enemies, or negative interactions via pollination. Habitat shifts might also select for diverged flowering time, or cause flowering time divergence, if phylogenetically conserved cues arrive at different times across habitats. Here, we ask if flowering phenology is phylogenetically conserved for 208 species at our coastal field site in northern California, whether flowering phenology differs systematically across habitat types, and whether habitat shifts are associated with phenological separation, especially in congeners. Because annuality and perenniality have been shown to be associated with habitat traits and flowering time, we included life history in our analyses as well. We also explore the frequency of habitat shifts between congener and noncongener pairs. We use both field observations and data from Jepson eFlora/Jepson Manual 2 (Baldwin et al. 2012) to explore patterns in flowering phenology. The two data sources were well-correlated across 59 species. Phylogeny, habitat, and life history all influenced flowering time, and habitat and life history were also phylogenetically conserved across 208 spp. Congeners differed in habitat more often than noncongener pairs, and also overlapped more in flowering time. Habitat shifts were not associated with shifts in flowering time in congeners, despite mean peak flowering time differences across habitats, and phylogenetic conservatism in habitat use. Congeners that differed in both habitat use and life history, however, did have the greatest difference in peak flowering dates. Habitat shifts likely play a role in local coexistence of close relatives, but our data do not support habitat-mediated changes in phenology as a possible mechanism. Experimental approaches may elucidate the role of phenology, resource competition, pollinators, and other associates in mediating coexistence of congeners at our coastal California field site.",https://openalex.org/W4200399770,38e1588b45ff3bda460c93b6effe6136ede84c06,0,True,0.9603861570358276,0

However, empirical evidence for this trade-off is mixed, raising questions about the extent to which it shapes diverse ecological communities. Here, we outline a framework that can be used to improve empirical tests of the competition-colonization trade-off. We argue that tests of the competition-colonization trade-off have been diverted into unproductive paths when dispersal mode and/or competition type have been inadequately defined. To generate comparative predictions of associations between dispersal and competitive performance, we develop a conceptual trait-based framework that clarifies how dispersal mode and type of competitor shape this trade-off at the stage of dispersal and establishment in a variety of systems. Our framework suggests that competition-colonization trade-offs may be less common for passively dispersing organisms when competitive dominants are those best able to withstand resource depletion (competitive response), and for active dispersers when traits for dispersal performance are positively associated with resource pre-emption (competitive effect). The framework presented here is designed to provide common ground for researchers working in different systems in order to prompt more effective assessment of this performance trade-off and its role in shaping community structure. By delineating key system properties that mediate the trade-off between competitive and colonization performance and their relationship to individual-level traits, researchers in disparate systems can structure their predictions about this trade-off more effectively and compare across systems more clearly.",https://openalex.org/W4309244382,df3f179616fd405d7dd7f7758bec040eb7c1e49d,0,True,0.9775630235671997,0

To examine factors affecting the stability of the classic tri-trophic oyster reef cascade within a different context, configurations of three predators, including the Gulf toadfish, Gulf stone crab, and oystershell mud crab, were manipulated together with either oyster shell or limestone gravel substrate within a multiple predator effects (MPE) experiment. Additionally, a complimentary set of trait-mediated-indirect interaction (TMII) experiments examined the inhibition of oyster consumption relative to mud-crab size and top predator identity in the absence of other cues and factors. The classic tri-trophic cascade formed by the toadfish-mud crab-oyster configuration was potentially weakened by several interactions within the MPE experiment. Consumption of oysters and mud crabs by the intraguild stone crab was undeterred by the presence of toadfish. Although mud crab feeding was inhibited in the presence of both toadfish and stone crabs, estimated non-consumptive effects (NCEs) were weaker for stone crabs in the MPE experiment. Consequently, the total effect was destabilizing when all three predator species were together. Inhibition of mud crab feeding was inversely related to direct predation on mud crabs within the MPE experiment. Complimentary TMII experiments revealed greater inhibition of mud crab feeding in response to stone crabs under sparse conditions. TMII experiments also implied that inhibition of mud crab feeding could have largely accounted for NCEs relative to oysters within the MPE experiment, as opposed to interference by other mud crabs or top predators. An inverse relationship between mud crab size and NCE strength in the TMII experiment disclosed another potentially destabilizing influence on the tri-trophic-cascade. Finally, although habitat complexity generally dampened the consumption of oysters across MPE treatments, complex habitat promoted mud crab feeding in the presence of toadfish alone. This study underscores how ecological interactions can mediate trophic cascades and provides some additional insights into the trophic dynamics of oyster reefs for further testing under natural conditions.",https://openalex.org/W3113191423,426698084b0f34c6914d4067197e7ac6d8eb7a8c,0,True,0.9978657960891724,0

This may favor the evolution of defective traits that are harmful to the species population as a whole, and that may lead to its dilution or even to its extinction (the tragedy of the commons). Here, we show that this phenomenon can be circumvented by cooperation plasticity, in which an individual decides, based on environmental conditions, whether to cooperate or to defect. Specifically, we analyze the evolution of density-dependent cooperation. In our model, the population is spatially subdivided, periodically remixed, and comprises several species. We find that evolution pushes individuals to be more cooperative when their own species is at lower densities, and we show that not only could this cooperation prevent the tragedy of the commons, but it could also facilitate coexistence between many species that compete for the same resource.",https://openalex.org/W1854240259,41bf964504205dac7849e63bf1e654eb8d9438b4,0,True,0.9404155611991882,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2007.01978.x,Fungal endophytes of grasses: hybrids rescued by vertical transmission? An evolutionary perspective,"Neotyphodium species are asexual ascomycetes growing as endophytes in cool-season grasses (Poaceae). They do not induce symptoms, and sporulate sparsely or not at all on their hosts; they are vertically transmitted through plant seeds (Fig. 1; cycle A). Neotyphodium spp. constitute fascinating symbiotic models offering various benefits to the host plants. In addition to accumulating toxic alkaloids (Bush et al., 1997) protecting against grazers and herbivorous insects (Omacini et al., 2001; Clay et al., 2005), Neotyphodium spp. also improve plant mineral nutrition (Lyons et al., 1990), tolerance to water-deficit stress (Elmi & West, 1995) and toxic soil compounds (Monnet et al., 2001; reviewed by Clay & Schardl, 2002). This symbiosis profoundly affects ecological performances of host plants and trophic webs, for example phytophagous insects (Omacini et al., 2001) or litter-degradation microbes (Lemons et al., 2005). Costs entailed in American and Australian pastures by endophytes of tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum = Festuca arundinacea), that strongly reduce livestock performance, have been largely popularized (Ball et al., 1993). Several recent studies suggest that a continuum between purely mutualistic and pathogenic (i.e. detrimental to the host plant) associations might exist (Faeth & Sullivan, 2003; Müller & Kraus, 2005). An intriguing feature is the genomic origin of Neotyphodium endophytes. They are most often hybrids between pathogenic fungal species, and some have even undergone at least two successive hybridization events (Moon et al., 2004). Here, we focus on this unexpected evolutionary origin of Neotyphodium spp. We (1) briefly summarize evidence that they are often hybrids between pathogenic fungal species; (2) propose new explanations accounting for the unexpectedly high frequency of hybrids among the asexual Neotyphodium endophytes; and (3) tentatively describe a biological scenario where such hybridizations could occur. Our model emphasizes the role and consequences of hybridization in fungal evolution, and may apply to a much wider range of fungi. Epichloë spp. can reproduce asexually by invading their host's seeds (A), through a sexual cycle where ascospores are formed (B) on a stroma or 'choke' (inset picture) that destroys the inflorescence, and more rarely through asexual spores (C). Transmission is thus vertical (A) or horizontal (B, C). Neotyphodium species, endophytes derived from Epichloë spp., mostly carry out asexual reproduction through seeds (A), resulting in a dominant or exclusive vertical transmission. Conceivably, rare horizontal transmission could occur via asexual spores (C), but has never been demonstrated. Neotyphodium is a form genus representing the mitotic state of ascomycetes related to the Clavicipitaceae, an order including the ergot fungus Claviceps purpurea. Strictly asexual Neotyphodium spp. arose repeatedly from the sexual genus Epichloë, which causes 'choke' disease of grasses (Moon et al., 2004; Gentile et al., 2005). Epichloë spp. colonize grass tissues biotrophically (Fig. 1). Their sexual stage arrests development of the plant inflorescence (White et al., 1991) by producing a 'choke', namely a stroma surrounding the arrested inflorescence. Haploid conidia acting as male gametes are produced by the young stroma, but heterothallism does not allow any selfing. Following reception of compatible conidia from another thallus, plasmogamy takes place in the stroma, followed by formation of mature fruiting structures (perithecia) containing sacs (asci) of meiotic spores. These ascospores are forcibly ejected to infect new host plants (horizontal transmission, Fig. 1, cycle B). Conceivably, conidia formed on stromata or the epiphytic hyphae sometimes observed (White et al., 1996) might very rarely allow an asexual horizontal transmission (Fig. 1, cycle C). Depending on the host–fungus combination, stromata may occur on all inflorescences (thus annihilating seed production), or on a limited number of tillers, allowing some seed production (Pan & Clay, 2002). In the latter case, vertical transmission usually occurs as well, since fungal hyphae invade the seeds (Fig. 1, cycle A). At the opposite extreme, asexual Neotyphodium spp. cause little or (typically) no choke, and mostly transmit vertically through seeds and stolons (Fig. 1, cycle A). They thus do not cause symptoms and are nonpathogenic. Phylogenetic analyses of the genes tub2 (for beta-tubulin), act1 (for actin) and tef1 (for transcription elongation factor 1-alpha) have revealed an unexpected feature: most asexual Neotyphodium spp. display several gene copies with different phylogenetic origins among Epichloë spp. (Craven et al., 2001; Moon et al., 2004; Gentile et al., 2005; Fig. 2). They thus are interspecific polyploids (= allopolyploids) arising from two parental Epichloë spp., or more. From the 59 endophytes isolated by Moon et al. (2004) and Gentile et al. (2005), 44 were hybrids. In some Neotyphodium spp., different numbers of gene copies of divergent origin are found from one locus to another, indicating that the hybrids subsequently lost some redundant gene copies. Hybrid origin and heteroploidy (polyploidy and aneuploidy) have been confirmed in many endophytes by allozyme studies (Leuchtmann & Clay, 1990), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) studies (Tredway et al., 1999) and microsatellite analysis (Moon et al., 2004). Evolutionary dynamic of the Neotyphodium–Epichloë complex. Asexual Neotyphodium can arise directly from haploid Epichloë strains (on the left). Other asexual Neotyphodium spp. are hybrids that can be converted into heteroploids (= aneuploids); the diagram depicts a possible scenario for their origin (on the right). Up to now, hybridization has been suggested to occur in strains that would have first lost the ability to form stromata and thus transmit vertically and asexually. Hybrids would be secondarily selected for several reasons (Moon et al., 2002, 2004). First, hybridization would help mask or reverse effects of Muller's ratchet, that is, the irreversible accumulation of deleterious mutations that cannot be purged by recombination in clonal species. However, many biotrophic or pathogenic asexual ascomycetes are not hybrids, demonstrating that parasitic fungi can survive asexually, without hybridization (Taylor et al., 1999). Second, hybridization allows accumulation of genes for alkaloid production, a defence that improves the host's fitness and, owing to vertical transmission, the fungal fitness itself. Actually, more toxins or higher toxin levels improve the deterrent or toxic effect on herbivores (Wilkinson et al., 2000; Tanaka et al., 2005). However, the occurrence of true haploid strains among Neotyphodium spp. (Brem & Leuchtmann, 2003; Moon et al., 2002) suggests that hybridization is not necessary for emergence and survival of vertically transmitted, mutualistic endophytes. We do not ignore the fact that hybridization contributes to evolution of fungi and symbiosis. However, we suggest that answering the reverse question (next) provides a more convincing explanation of the apparent correlation between hybridization and mutualism + vertical transmission. Because interspecific hybrids with such features obviously have better fitness! Hybrids are both male- and female-infertile (Moon et al., 2004) and cannot produce ascospores (Schardl & Leuchtmann, 1999), perhaps because correct chromosome pairing for meiosis is not possible as a result of heteroploidy (Fig. 1, cycle B). If a hybrid still produces stromata, it can neither produce ascospores nor survive through seeds because of arrested development of the inflorescence. Since there is no evidence that conidia from stromata can infect new hosts, it does not reproduce. Any chromosome doubling to restore meiotic fertility would be useless, since diploid vegetative nuclei are unstable in ascomycetes (leading to the parasexual cycle, see later). Investment in stroma formation is thus counter-selected, as it decreases the fungal fitness. In other words, inability to form stromata is an evolutionarily stable strategy for hybrids. Once strict vertical transmission is achieved, the two partners' fitnesses are linked, that is (1) any increase of the plant fitness (stolon and/or seed production) in turn increases the fungal fitness, and (2) once the fungus is beneficial to its host, any increase of the fungal fitness also profits the plant. Selection for mutualism by vertical transmission has been already discussed (Ewald, 1987). The very diverse positive effects of Neotyphodium spp. on hosts reported so far, ranging from growth traits to nutrition and protection (already discussed), can be viewed as evolutionary 'bricolages', recruiting any mechanism to increase plant fitness. Recent works, mostly in Festuca arizonica, suggest that some seed-transmitted Neotyphodium spp. might not be mutualistic. Several differences between partners might account for this. (1) It is conceivable that horizontal transmission can occur owing to conidia formation on vegetative hyphae (White et al., 2001; Fig. 1, cycle C), although such a transmission route is far from demonstrated in Neotyphodium spp. (Latch & Christensen, 1985). (2) Whereas the fungal fitness directly depends on seeds (and thus, ovule) production, the fitness of plant genes depends on both ovule and pollen production (Faeth, 2002); pollen production diverts resources from ovule production and therefore from fungal reproduction. These two factors (1) and (2) can subtly dissociate host and fungal fitness. (3) Plant sexual reproduction leads to new allele combinations at each generation, whereas the asexual fungal genome remains identical; changing genome of each partner at each generation might limit the evolution of mutualism (Faeth et al., 2004). Therefore, although many Neotyphodium endophytes are mutualistic (Fig. 2), antagonism can be selected. Our scenario (hybridization followed by selection for vertical transmission and mutualism) is not the only one leading to asexual Neotyphodium spp., but explains why all hybrids are asymptomatic and often mutualistic. Some haploid, apparently nonhybrid strains also occur among mutualistic, vertically transmitted Neotyphodium spp. (Moon et al., 2002), so that direct selection from haploid Epichloë spp. can occur (Fig. 2). For example, Neotyphodium lolii is clearly a derivative of Epichloë festucae, as indicated by multigene phylogenetic analyses (Moon et al., 2004). Might cryptic hybrids exist among these 'haploid'Neotyphodium spp.? Indeed, heteroploid hybrids might undergo a progressive loss of chromosomes (or chromosome fragments) by drift, to eventually produce haploid nuclei – at this step, chromosome loss is counter-selected since there is no more genetic redundancy. This is the parasexual cycle described within ascomycete species by Pontecorvo (1956) and recently rediscovered in the human pathogenic ascomycete Candida albicans (Bennett & Johnson, 2003): haploid nuclei are produced after a vegetative karyogamy, via transient aneuploid states. If interspecific hybrids of Epichloë spp. subsequently haploidize, how can such secondary haploids be identified? Indirect controls of ploidy might exist: in hybrids, hyphae still produce conidia (Fig. 1, cycle C) whose size is larger than that of conidia from true haploid strains (Kuldau et al., 1999; Craven et al., 2001). Molecular markers provide easier testing methods; however, the probability that such haploids would go undetected can be calculated as follows. During gene loss, the probability of retaining the gene copy from a given parent for a given locus is 0.5, assuming random loss. For n genetically independent loci, the probability of looking exactly as one parent is thus 0.5n. As there are two parents, the probability, P, of looking genetically identical to one of them at n loci is thus P = 2 × 0.5n = 0.5n−1. If we assume no interchromosomic recombination, then each chromosome behaves as a single locus and, since Epichloë species tend to have five or six chromosomes (Kuldau et al., 1999), P is at best 6.25%. If interchromosomic recombination occurs, as in true parasexual cycle, then all markers behave independently and P is 25% for three loci and only 0.1024% for 10 loci. This risk is underestimated if there is little polymorphism between the two ancestral species, but so far, Epichloë species have been readily distinguishable by molecular polymorphism. Several loci are thus required to assess that an apparently haploid strain is not a secondarily haploidized hybrid. Typical analyses of Epichloë and Neotyphodium genotypes involve two or three sequenced loci, plus at least three and as many as eight multisatellite or isozyme loci (Schardl et al., 1994; Moon et al., 2004). It is remarkable that, despite the large number of interspecific heteroploid hybrids detected to date, there has never been any evidence of a haploidized hybrid. We can conclude either that haploidization rarely occurs, or that it involves selective loss of genetic material from one parent only. So, why are there so many hybrids among seed-transmitted Neotyphodium endophytes? Our scenario also predicts why hybrids predominate, although hybridization is not a parsimonious mechanism. Haploid endophytes directly evolved from Epichloe spp. might revert to form stromata and transmit horizontally (Fig. 2) because their euploidy allows meiosis and ascospore formation. Conversely, hybrids cannot, because they are heteroploid, and are thus more stable as vertically transmitted endophytes. Finally, as previously mentioned, hybrids produce more diverse and abundant alkaloids than sexual species, most of which produce low or undetectable amounts of alkaloids (Leuchtmann et al., 2000). Confined to a vertical transmission, hybrids can thus profit their hosts, and improve their host's fitness more easily than haploid endophytes. Does hybridization occur at the fungal vegetative state or during mating? Vegetative hybridization would involve hyphal fusion followed by nuclear fusion during endophytic growth. By contrast, sexual hybridization would first require exchange of conidia between stromata. For sexual Epichloë spp., flies of the genus Botanophila generally mediate this exchange. These flies are not strictly specific (Bultman & Leuchtmann, 2003), and may sometimes facilitate illegitimate interspecific matings, but this rarely if ever leads to ascospore production (Schardl & Leuchtmann, 1999). It is unknown whether such matings abort before or after formation of a diploid nucleus. Even if a diploid hybrid nucleus forms, it is unclear how to convert the diploid cell (that usually undergoes meiosis; Fig. 1) into a vegetative hypha. Out of a very large number of experimental mating attempts between all described Epichloë species, only one generated hybrids (Schardl & Leuchtmann, 1999). Furthermore, these sexual hybrids did not produce heteroploid Neotyphodium spp. because the progeny were haploid recombinants, and they had to be rescued from the stroma since ascospores did not eject (Schardl & Leuchtmann, 1999). Sexual hybridization between different Epichloë spp. thus appears problematic. A more likely scenario for hybrid origin is a vegetative nuclear fusion between two Epichloë spp. growing within a single host. Hyphal fusion is common among ascomycetes (Glass et al., 2004) including Epichloë spp. (Christensen et al., 2000). Hyphal fusions can lead to a heterokaryotic condition, whereby the two parental nuclei coexist in the same hypha. Although vegetative incompatibility barriers make heterokaryons between distantly related strains or different species unlikely in most ascomycetes, experimental evidence supports the ability of different Epichloë species to form heterokaryons, at least in culture (Chung et al., 1997). A vegetative event is further supported by the fact that some hybrids have three, not just two, parents (Moon et al., 2004), that is, one of the ancestors was already a hybrid. Considering that no hybrid has been observed to be male fertile (in test matings to their ancestral species) or to produce stromata (a prerequisite for female fertility), it is very unlikely that a hybrid could generate sexual hybrids. It follows that such an event must have occurred vegetatively, on a plant harbouring a hybrid that was super-infected by a second Epichloë species, likely via ascospore (Fig. 1). Whether such super-infections favour hybridization needs to be experimentally tested. Coinfection of individual plants with two endophyte species has been achieved experimentally, but competitive exclusion in tillers tends to eliminate one or the other (Wille et al., 1999; Christensen et al., 2000). Therefore, hybridization events must occur shortly after coinfection or in rare instances of long-term coinfection. The former scenario seems more likely, since no naturally occurring grass plants simultaneously bearing two species of the Neotyphodium/Epichloë complex were observed. An intriguing observation is that many hybrids live in grass species that are quite distantly related to all of their parents' known hosts (Chung et al., 1997; Moon et al., 2004; Gentile et al., 2005). Furthermore, endophytes can cause a defence response if introduced into nonhost species, sometimes leading to spontaneous endophyte extinction after inoculation (Koga et al., 1993; Christensen, 1995; Christensen et al., 2000). To account for these observations, we propose that most hybridizations occur soon after a rare event of dual colonization of an 'unusual' host (i.e. a novel host) species (Fig. 2) by the two parental strains. Maladaptation of parental strains to that host could reduce competition and thus allow coexistence, hyphal fusion and survival of the resulting hybrid. Hybrids may be more fit and finally competitively exclude parental strains. Indeed, a 'genomic shock', including a transposon burst and new genetic regulations, arises when genomes of different species coexist in allopolyploids (Comai et al., 2003), producing new phenotypes (Osborn et al., 2003). Such changes make hybrids a good substrate for selection of genetic combinations more adapted to the unusual host. Indeed, a simple meiosis was shown to modify epistasis between genes and reveal new host compatibilities in offspring compared with their parents (Chung et al., 1997). Moreover, living on an unusual host might also impede the parents from forming stromata, allow seed formation and select for vertical transmission of the hybrid. An intriguing variation on this scenario is that an endophyte might actually colonize a new host by vertical transmission. Interspecific hybridization is a common and dramatic evolutionary process in plants that occurs very commonly under the form of allopolyploidy in grasses (Gaut, 2002; Levy & Feldman, 2002). Such a situation might challenge the survival of endophytes issuing from the mother species by vertical transmission. Superinfection by horizontally transmitted ascospores from another Epichloë species may then allow hybridization and formation of a new genomic combination more adapted to the 'new' host: the likelihood and role of this process await further experimental testing but may account for several observations. For example, the hexaploid grass Lolium arundinaceum is a hybrid of Lolium pratense (= Festuca pratense) and a tetraploid L. arundinaceum, but the endophytes of L. pratense and L. arundinaceum are unstable in each other's host (Christensen, 1995). Thus, it is particularly fascinating that: (1) ancestors of Neotyphodium coenophialum, a hybrid common on L. arundinaceum, has genomes closely related to those of hybrid and non-hybrid endophytes in related Lolium and Festuca spp.; and (2), conversely, the polyploid series of grasses related to L. arundinaceum hosts many different hybrid species of endophyte (Tsai et al., 1994; C. L. Schardl, unpublished). It should also be noted that host hybridization is the only way for hybrid Neotyphodium to colonize a 'new' host (if it transfers strictly vertically) and thus, the exclusive way to undergo secondary hybridization. To summarize, hybrids might be selected as a way of evolving greater compatibility with an unusual host plant. Whatever the scenario, experimental coinoculations could test for hybrid formation and competition with parental strains on host and nonhost grass species, to better understand the origins of hybrid Neotyphodium spp. We suggest evolutionary trajectories (Fig. 2) that account for the emergence of hybrid Neotyphodium spp. and await experimental tests. A genomic shock of hybridization on plants that are unusual hosts for the parental species provides raw material from which adaptation to the new host can arise, while meiotic sterility selects for vertical transmission and therefore mutualism. Is this evolution only relevant for clavicipitaceous endophytes of cool-season grasses? We feel that it might be only the tip of an iceberg. First, many endophytic fungi play important physiological roles for their hosts (Arnold et al., 2003), and their diversity is overlooked (Arnold et al., 2000). Several well-known fungi previously considered as saprophytes were recently reported as asymptomatic endophytes, such as Xylariaceae (Davis et al., 2003) or the Helotiales Tricladium and Tetracladium spp. (Abadie et al., 2006). Second, in many saprobic and pathogenic species, asymptomatic endophytism may result from genetic or phenotypic plasticity (Schulz & Boyle, 2005). For example, a single mutation can convert a pathogenic strain of Colletotrichum magna into an endophytic, protective mutualist (Freeman & Rodriguez, 1993). Conversely, a single mutation can change a mutualistic Neotyphodium strain into a pathogen (Tanaka et al., 2006). Endophytic mutualists may thus often reversibly arise from pathogens. How many of these endophytes are vertically transmitted? Does hybridization contribute to the rise of vertically transmitted fungal variants, by destroying the usual ways of sporulation? Does vertical transmission of these endophytes favour selection of mutualistic relationships? Further studies may clarify to what extent Neotyphodium endophytes from cool-season grasses provide a general model for endophytism evolution among fungi. To A.

https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/art069,Prey handling performance facilitates competitive dominance of an invasive over native keystone ant,"Studies of species coexistence in ant communities often suggest that competitive interactions are mediated by behavioral trade-offs between resource discovery and dominance. However, these studies have always measured foraging at artificial, static baits that omit traits of living prey items and potential coevolutionary predator–prey relationships. In a series of lab experiments, we compare the ability of ants to harvest live termites (Reticulitermes virginicus) in nests varying in defensive ability. Moreover, we compare foraging performance of 2 co-occurring ant species—the North American native Aphaenogaster rudis and the invasive Pachycondyla chinensis—differing in their evolutionary experience hunting R. virginicus. Our results show how the invasive P. chinensis may displace the native keystone A. rudis by directly killing A. rudis workers and reducing termite prey available for A. rudis. Specifically, P. chinensis is more sensitive to novel termite prey than the native A. rudis and then destroys termite colonies—even if they are highly defended by soldiers or nest architecture. Our results further show how whole colony behavioral dominance by P. chinensis is mediated by behavioral interactions among individual workers. More generally, our experimental approach using live prey to study interspecific competition can integrate evolutionary dynamics into studies of proximate behavioral factors governing species coexistence.",https://openalex.org/W2143843862,60a146cdb8d3edeefbb701ba8e68a42467b8664f,0,True,0.9562001824378967,0

Here, in order to examine whether competition mechanisms can affect the foraging behaviour of wild Salmo trutta with respect to active-bottom, benthic-drift or surface-drift foraging, three neighbouring populations under different levels of fish density (high, intermediate and low) were studied. We analysed the foraging behaviour of each population according to niche breadth, prey preferences, the modified Costello graphical method and prey trait analysis. The results revealed a remarkable similarity in the feeding behaviour among these feral fish populations, suggesting a foraging behaviour convergence in response to site-specific prey accessibility. A generalist foraging behaviour was the prevailing feeding strategy, independent of fish density. Hence, this study offered evidence for the occurrence of density-independent individual foraging behaviour when food is abundant and available; however, density-dependent foraging behaviour might occur when resource limitation exists. Studies under natural conditions like the present study are needed to increase ecological realism, and indeed this study opens promising research directions for future feeding studies in territorial fish species.",https://openalex.org/W2004044438,d9cac459c49c4f69317802d3e1bb88c94f9c5ef2,0,True,0.981870710849762,0
https://doi.org/10.1655/herpetologica-d-14-00031,Stream Salamanders Accurately Assess Size-Dependent Predation Threats,"Individual size is an important determinant of the outcomes of inter- and intraspecific interactions. Different-sized members of a guild might represent prey, competitors, or predators. Although direct predation rates might be low, trait-mediated indirect effects of predators on prey can yield altered activity, microhabitat use, survival, and growth. If individuals respond to all sizes of a predator regardless of the predation threat, antipredator behaviors might incur costs for prey as they forgo foraging opportunities or experience predation by other predators. Accurate assessment of predation risk would minimize costs resulting from antipredator behavior. We evaluated the ability of larval salamanders to assess predation risk and alter their habitat selection in response to intraguild competitors and predators. Specifically, we assessed behavioral responses to the presence of a conspecific, a similarly sized heterospecific, and a small or large individual of a predatory species. We predicted that larval salamanders would select habitat differently in the presence of a large predatory heterospecific, but not in the presence of similarly sized heterospecifics or conspecifics. The focal species occupied habitat 29 ± 0.02% farther from a large heterospecific predator than from small heterospecifics, even if the heterospecifics were smaller individuals of the predatory species. The focal species also exhibited escape behaviors only in the presence of the large members of the predatory species. These data indicate that salamander larvae can assess size-specific predation threats, minimizing predation risk through use of antipredator behaviors.",https://openalex.org/W2201100592,db95c11d631ba9238010478f475fb222f211f04e,0,True,0.9877157211303711,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-4598.2012.00225.x,Landscape and local effects on multiparasitoid coexistence,"Abstract When resources are spatially fragmented, strength of competition between species is diminished by alternative patterns of resource use and parasitoids of the same host species become potential competitors. The coexistence of competing species in spatially fragmented habitats may be achieved, however, due to niche partitioning and alternative responses to patch characteristics. To evaluate responses to resource patterns facilitating coexistence, we examined the resource use patterns of four parasitoid species ( O rthopelma mediator, P teromalus bedeguaris, T orymus bedeguaris and G lyphomerus stigma ) of the gall inducer D iplolepis rosae at both landscape and local scales. Parasitoid species of rose gall communities behave differently at landscape and local scales. Parasitism rates and parasitoid incidence showed correlations with local characteristics in some cases, with landscape characteristics in others and, in some other cases with both. Species responses to the examined characteristics depend rather on life history traits of parasitoids than on their frequency within the community. The examined parasitoids responded differently to landscape and local characteristics, while their phenology corresponded with their responses. Species emerging earlier in spring ( O. mediator and P. bedeguaris) responded only to local variations, while later emerging species ( T. bedeguaris and G. stigma ) were sensitive to landscape characteristics as well. Differences between species‐specific and overall responses highlight the importance of species characteristics when considering multiparasitoid communities, and support both fine and coarse partitioning between different species coexisting in the community.",https://openalex.org/W2157608172,c3bcd6e4154d2724c7ea93b0e5a3339dd88db756,0,True,0.9927632808685303,0
https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.14277,Changes in ecological conditions may influence intraguild competition: inferring interaction patterns of snow leopard with co-predators,"Background Large-scale changes in habitat conditions due to human modifications and climate change require management practices to consider how species communities can alter amidst these changes. Understanding species interactions across the gradient of space, anthropogenic pressure, and season provide the opportunity to anticipate possible dynamics in the changing scenarios. We studied the interspecific interactions of carnivore species in a high-altitude ecosystem over seasonal (summer and winter) and resource gradients (livestock grazing) to assess the impact of changing abiotic and biotic settings on coexistence. Methods The study was conducted in the Upper Bhagirathi basin, Western Himalaya, India. We analyzed around 4 years of camera trap monitoring data to understand seasonal spatial and temporal interactions of the snow leopard with common leopard and woolly wolf were assessed in the greater and trans-Himalayan habitats, respectively. We used two species occupancy models to assess spatial interactions, and circadian activity patterns were used to assess seasonal temporal overlap amongst carnivores. In addition, we examined scats to understand the commonalities in prey selection. Results The result showed that although snow leopard and wolves depend on the same limited prey species and show high temporal overlap, habitat heterogeneity and differential habitat use facilitate co-occurrence between these two predators. Snow leopard and common leopard were spatially independent in the summer. Conversely, the common leopard negatively influences the space use of snow leopard in the winter. Limited prey resources (lack of livestock), restricted space (due to snow cover), and similar activity patterns in winter might result in strong competition, causing these species to avoid each other on a spatial scale. The study showed that in addition to species traits and size, ecological settings also play a significant role in deciding the intensity of competition between large carnivores. Climate change and habitat shifts are predicted to increase the spatial overlap between snow leopard and co-predators in the future. In such scenarios, wolves and snow leopards may coexist in a topographically diverse environment, provided sufficient prey are available. However, shifts in tree line might lead to severe competition between common leopards and snow leopards, which could be detrimental to the latter. Further monitoring of resource use across abiotic and biotic environments may improve our understanding of how changing ecological conditions can affect resource partitioning between snow leopards and predators.",https://openalex.org/W4307245106,09c5772d4b7ec9fd4197fec073d81aee2d00380b,0,True,0.9883849620819092,0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2020.566964,Nocturnal Bees Feed on Diurnal Leftovers and Pay the Price of Day – Night Lifestyle Transition,"1. Bees exemplify flights under bright sunlight. A few species across bee families have evolved nocturnality, displaying remarkable adaptations to overcome limitations of their daylight-suited apposition eyes. Phase inversion to nocturnality in a minority of bees that co-exist with diurnal bees provide a unique opportunity to study ecological benefits that mediate total temporal niche shifts. While floral traits and sensory modalities associated with the evolution of classical nocturnal pollination syndromes, e.g. by bats and moths, are well-studied, nocturnality in bees represent a poorly understood, recently invaded, extreme niche. 2. To test the competitive release hypothesis, we examine how nocturnality shapes foraging by comparing pollen loads, nest pollen and flower visitation of sympatric nocturnal and diurnal carpenter bees. We predicted that nocturnal bees primarily use night-blooming flowers, show little/no resource overlap with diurnal species and competitive release favours night-time pollen collection for provisioning. 3. Contrarily, we found substantial resource overlap between nocturnal and diurnal bees. Flower opening times, floral longevity and plant abundance did not define nocturnal flower use. Smaller pollen loads on nocturnal foragers suggests subsistence on resource leftovers largely from diurnal flowers. Greater pollen types/diversity on nocturnal foragers indicates lower floral constancy compared to diurnal congenerics. Reduced activity during new moon compared to full moon suggests constraints to nocturnal foraging. 4. Invasion and sustenance within the nocturnal niche is characterised by: i)opportunistic foraging on residual resources as indicated by smaller pollen loads, extensive utilisation of day-blooming flowers and substantial overlap with diurnal bees, ii)generalisation at two levels – between and within foraging trips as indicated by lower floral constancy, iii)reduced foraging on darker nights, indicating visual constraints despite sensitive optics. This together with smaller populations and univoltine breeding in nocturnal compared to multivoltine diurnal counterparts, suggest that nocturnality imposes substantial fitness costs. 5. In conclusion, the evolution of nocturnality in bees is accompanied by resource generalisation instead of specialisation. Reduced floral constancy suggests differences in foraging strategies of nocturnal and diurnal bees which merits further investigation. The relative roles of competition, floral rewards and predators should be examined to fully understand the evolution and maintenance of nocturnality in bees.",https://openalex.org/W3096976254,a458f8ed2a5edf7a2282fa308ce372c672156d77,0,True,0.9792998433113098,0
https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1461-9563.2002.00165.x,Are the ecological concepts of assembly and function of biodiversity useful frameworks for understanding natural pest control?,"At a time when biodiversity is being lost at an unprecedented rate due to human activity, much research effort has been spent on assessment of the importance of biodiversity for the functioning and stability of ecosystems and for the delivery of ecosystem services. Pest control has been identified on numerous occasions as a valuable ecosystem service delivered by biodiversity (Mooney et al., 1995a, b; Naeem et al., 1999; Schläpfer et al., 1999), and one that is at risk from human activity (Naylor & Ehrlich, 1997). There is considerable evidence that as agricultural production systems are intensified by increased use of external inputs to increase yield, they tend to lose biodiversity and become destabilized, with increased frequency and extent of pest outbreaks (Altieri, 1991; Swift et al., 1996). However, we know relatively little about the ecological mechanisms that result in this destabilization, or how important natural enemy diversity is in maintaining pest-control functioning. Numerous studies exist which consider the ecological or theoretical basis of biological control (e.g. see Hawkins & Cornell, 1999) but relatively little attention has been given to understanding pest control as a natural ecosystem function and how changes in agricultural practice may affect function through impacts on biodiversity. This applies particularly to the non-equilibrium conditions that exist in short duration or seasonal cropping systems. As such, and whilst some notable exceptions exist, it can generally be argued that patterns of pest emergence remain poorly explained and attempts to improve natural pest control through modifications to management practices have limited ecological foundation. The aim of this paper is to explore how current ecological thinking can help to improve on this situation and to propose some ecological frameworks that may facilitate investigation of the importance of biodiversity and the impact of management practices on it. Characterization of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has been a major research goal of ecology over the past decade. Numerous theoretical and empirical studies have been undertaken on many ecosystem properties, including biomass production (producers, consumers and decomposers), nutrient uptake and retention, decomposition, soil pH, soil water and organic matter content and community respiration (Schläpfer & Schmid, 1999), although little has been published on the importance of diversity in natural enemy assemblages for pest control functioning (but see Rodríguez & Hawkins, 2000). The majority of these studies have observed a saturating positive relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning (Schwartz et al., 2000). One mechanism whereby species diversity influences ecosystem functioning is resource-use complementarity. That is, different species occupy different niches allowing complementary functioning of species in heterogeneous or temporally variable environments. The slope of the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem functioning is partly dependent on the extent to which species overlap functionally, with respect to the particular ecosystem process of concern. If all species have an equal and non-overlapping effect on a particular process (perfect complementarity), then a linear reduction in the rate of the process would occur as species richness decreased (Fig. 1). At the other extreme, if there is no complementarity (species are 'redundant' with respect to the function concerned, see Walker, 1992; Lawton & Brown, 1993), then remaining species would be able to compensate for lost species and a sudden and complete loss of functioning would occur as the final functional species was lost. Hypothesized response of ecosystem function to decrease in species richness. If species are redundant then the response exhibits threshold behaviour in which significant reductions in functioning occur suddenly as the threshold is reached. By contrast, if species are complementary, each having non-overlapping roles, the response is a gradual loss of function with species loss. If species identity is important then the response can follow a broad range of trajectories (represented by the shaded region) depending on the order of species loss. Another mechanism resulting in a positive relationship between species diversity and ecosystem functioning has been termed the 'sampling effect' (Aarssen, 1997; Huston, 1997). This effect occurs if the probability of including a species with a strong influence on ecosystem functioning increases as species diversity increases. The sampling effect is viewed by some as a true diversity effect (Tilman et al., 1997), but by others as an experimental artefact, because its expression is dependent on the probability of inclusion of species, which are under the control of the experimenter and usually do not reflect natural probabilities. The sampling effect is one expression of species composition effects, i.e. effects that arise from the fact that species differ in their functional capacity. More generally, compositional effects are expressed as variance in the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning (Hooper & Vitousek, 1997; Hooper, 1998; Petchey, 2000). In the extreme, a single species may have a much greater impact on process rate than other species (e.g. a keystone species). In such a scenario, the observed relationship between diversity and function would be idiosyncratic (Lawton, 1994), i.e. it could take any trajectory within a broad envelope of response (Fig. 1), depending on the order of species loss (Sala et al., 1996). Thus, strong species composition effects mean that function cannot be predicted from species diversity alone. Key attributes of a system determining important characteristics of the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem functioning are therefore the extent to which the functioning of species complement each other, and the extent to which species are unequal in their impact on a particular process. In order to predict the response of a particular ecosystem process to reductions in species diversity, we must understand the ecological mechanisms behind complementarity and species composition effects. To answer the broader question of what are the impacts of human activity on the ecosystem process of interest (in our case natural pest control), we must additionally understand how and at what rate human activities have an impact on diversity. In ecological terms, this means the linked study of both the assembly and function of diversity in human-impacted ecosystems. A conceptual framework for linking diversity assembly and function can be made by identifying the traits of species that govern their membership to functional response groups and functional effect groups (Catovsky, 1998) (Fig. 2). In other words, by bringing together the traits we know govern response to management with those that are important for function we can formulate hypotheses concerning the effect of management on functioning. The way in which this linkage is made is somewhat dependent on the relative importance of diversity and composition effects in driving function. For example, if species composition effects do not strongly influence functioning, then we have extensive overlap between effect and response groups. That is, as species identity is not important, all species remaining after management are likely to have functional significance. If species are complementary in function, then any reduction in species diversity will reduce the functional capacity of the community, as each species functions uniquely to some extent. Alternatively, in a system with extensive redundancy among species, reduction in the size of the overlap between response and effect groups will have little impact on function. Where there are strong species composition effects, the amount of overlap between response and effect groups is reduced considerably and we must focus on the traits determining joint membership of response and effect groups. Conceptual scheme linking management effects to their functional consequences. Identification of the traits governing species membership to functional response groups and those governing membership to functional effect groups, allows logical connection between the impact of human activities and their functional significance. Clearly then, as a starting point for implementing these ideas in the context of impacts on pest control of changes in biodiversity, a key issue to understand is the extent to which species composition or diversity effects predominate in determining function. To examine this issue further, we draw on a recent study concerning the effect of pest life-history characteristics and their influence on natural enemy complementarity and species composition effects via the influence on food web structure (Wilby & Thomas, 2002). It is known that major life-history characteristics of an insect herbivore, such as whether development mode is hemi- or holometabolous, can have a major influence on the number and diversity of natural enemies in the herbivore's natural enemy assemblage (Fig. 3). Endopterygote insects (holometabolous development) undergo dramatic morphological and behavioural changes between egg, larva, pupa and adult, and these life stages often play very different ecological roles, utilizing different food and occupying different sites. By contrast, exopterygote insects (hemimetabolous development) undergo relatively gradual changes between life stages, which often occupy similar sites and utilize similar food. As a consequence of these differences, we expect differences in the structure of linkages between these insect types and their natural enemies. The natural enemy complex interacting with endopterygote insects should be largely segregated into groups attacking particular life stages of the herbivore; most of those enemies feeding on adults would not be expected to also feed on larvae or pupae (e.g. see Waloff, 1968; Barrion et al., 1991; Mills, 1994; Oatman, 1995a, b; Luna & Sánches, 1999). On the other hand, due to the similarity in site occupancy and behaviour, natural enemies feeding on exopterygote insects are expected to feed on both nymphs and adults. Hence, because of the life-cycle structure, the natural enemy complex feeding on endopterygote insects should exhibit more complementarity among species compared with that feeding on exopterygote insects. Simulation studies have shown that the higher complementarity among natural enemies of endopterygote insects may result in gradual loss of pest control functioning with decreasing natural enemy species diversity, whereas control of exopterygotes should be relatively resistant, with a sudden loss of pest control functioning occurring only after extreme loss of natural enemy diversity. These predictions appear to be consistent with pest emergence patterns during intensification of Asian rice production systems (Wilby & Thomas, 2002). Life history characteristics of herbivorous insects and their hypothesized influence on the interacting natural enemy complex. (a) A simplified endopterygote insect, (b) a simplified exopterygote insect, (c) morphological or behavioural concealment, and (d) shortened life span. Other aspects of herbivore life history are likely to influence the richness or characteristics of the natural enemy complex, with implications for pest control functioning. For example, morphological or behavioural concealment tends to promote tight linkage of population dynamics between the herbivore and natural enemy (Fig. 3c). Thus, with concealed herbivores, specialist parasitoids increase in importance compared with relatively generalist predators (Memmott et al., 2000), although some concealed herbivores may be attacked by relatively more species of generalist parasitoid than specialist parasitoid (Hawkins, 1990; Hawkins et al., 1992). In essence, tight linkages between specialist natural enemies and pests inflate the importance of species composition effects and increase the uncertainty about response to random species loss. This predication is supported by simulation studies, which indicate that control of concealed pests should be relatively sensitive to natural enemy species loss, and that responses should be highly variable due to strong composition effects. These predictions are also borne out along intensification gradients in Asian rice (Wilby & Thomas, 2002). The previous discussion shows that attributes of the basic life-history characteristics of the organisms involved can lead to different predictions about the relative importance of diversity and species composition in determining pest control functioning. This allows us to move beyond arguments of whether species composition or diversity is the most important attribute of the natural enemy community, to a position where we can predict which types of pest are likely to require particular natural enemy types for control, and which are likely to be better controlled by a diverse assemblage of natural enemies. The characteristics discussed serve as examples of general widespread life-history characteristics that are hypothesized to influence the relationship between diversity and pest control. The list is by no means exhaustive, and other traits are immediately apparent. For example, herbivore life span is also likely to have important consequences for the richness and characteristics of the natural enemy complex. The shorter the life span of a herbivorous species, the smaller the number of natural enemy species that overlap phenologically with the herbivore (Cornell & Hawkins, 1993). Consequently, control of a pest with a shorter life span should depend on a group of natural enemies with less redundancy, either across the life cycle in the case of exopterygote insects, or within life-cycle stages in the case of endopterygote insects. In either case, and with all else being equal, control of short-lived insects should decrease earlier, on average, in response to natural enemy species loss. The above examples show how herbivore characteristics may influence the relative importance of natural enemy species diversity and composition and the types of natural enemies likely to be important, where composition effects are likely. The next step to facilitate prediction of the effects of agricultural management on pest control functioning is to link these arguments with management effects on diversity and composition. One approach to understanding the effects of agricultural management on arthropod diversity is to consider management impacts in the context of arthropod community assembly. Assembly rules have a long history in community ecology, where the objective has been to predict which species will occur in a particular habitat (Keddy, 1992). Although many authors reserve the term 'assembly rule' for the processes of species interaction which limit inclusion of species in a community (e.g. Belyea & Lancaster, 1999), we prefer to take a broad definition that includes processes of dispersal and colonization in addition to interspecific interactions. We follow Roughgarden & Diamond (1986) in identifying three types of filtration that govern which species from the set of all species in the region can occupy a site (Fig. 4). We also make considerable use of the terminology of Kelt et al. (1995) and Belyea & Lancaster (1999), although we present the species filtration process in a sequential fashion, relating to the order, and scale at which species negotiate the filters. Community assembly encompassing dispersal, environmental filtering and internal community dynamics. Agroecosystem management can modify each of these processes. In order for a species to be present at a particular site, it must first be capable of arriving at the site. Dispersal constraints govern which species from the regional species pool are included in the local species pool, i.e. those species that are able to disperse to the site in question. Of those species in the local species pool, only those species that are able to overcome environmental constraints imposed by abiotic filters at the site occupy the ecological species pool. Finally, internal community dynamics (or biotic filters), including intra- and interspecific processes govern composition of the actual species pool. In addition to governing presence of species in communities, these processes also influence species abundance. This allows the framework to be used to describe the important processes driving species diversity and composition. The importance of this framework with respect to management effects on natural pest control derives from its description of the full range of ecological influences (at scales below continental and regional level processes) that can influence a species' abundance in a particular site. Although this may be somewhat heuristic, rather than explicitly mechanistic, its usefulness derives from the potential for generalizations to be made connecting the filters of the assembly process to particular biological traits likely to be most sensitive to changes in these filters. We can also relate particular management practices to the filters and to the biological traits that they are likely to affect. Dispersal constraints, for example, are largely influenced by structural alterations in the landscape that occur as a result of land-use change. It is known that the way in which insects respond to fragmentation is related to several traits. Body size, for instance, has been shown to affect the spatial scale of fragmentation to which populations of parasitoids are sensitive (Roland & Taylor, 1997). Larger parasitoids tend to be more mobile and have populations extending over large areas. Thus, as a habitat is fragmented, the larger parasitoids are affected first and as a result we may expect to find changes in the size distribution of natural enemies. If this extends to predators, then this is likely to be functionally significant, given the constraints of size on prey selection. Continuing with this theme, there is a large body of literature concerning the effect of fragmentation on insect communities. Generally, fragmentation of habitats has a greater effect on the abundance and species richness of higher trophic levels, and parasitoids in general are known to be particularly susceptible (Kruess & Tscharntke, 1994; Zabel & Tscharntke, 1998; Tscharntke & Kruess, 1999). However, considerable complexity arises as dispersal constraints interact with abiotic and biotic constraints to determine how species respond to fragmentation. For example, agricultural development tends to result in an increase in crop area relative to non-crop area. We may expect therefore that species specializing on the crop habitat will respond in a different fashion to those specializing in non-crop habitats. For natural enemies, this may mean promotion of species specializing on crop pests and a decrease in the relative abundance of more generalist species. Referring to our earlier discussion, an emergent prediction from this is that control of endophagous pest species may be facilitated by increases in crop area, whereas control of external feeders, particularly endopterygotes, may be reduced. Of course, this prediction is based on the assumption that specialist natural enemies are able to persist in a crop habitat. It is known that many parasitoid species require alternative food sources such as nectar and pollen (Landis & Menalled, 1998) and may be sensitive to practices such as tillage during fallow periods (e.g. Nilsson, 1985). In this case, control of endophagous pests will only be sustained following increases in crop area if nectar sources are available and if tillage is asynchronously applied across the landscape so that natural enemies are able to re-colonize from adjacent undisturbed patches. In addition, the spatial scale at which management is synchronized will have a major influence on the ability of natural enemies to re-colonize, and this re-colonization is likely to be related to their body size due to its relationship with mobility. Similarly, although we may expect generalist natural enemies to be reduced with increased scale and uniformity of crop environment, in practice, even limited non-crop areas adjacent to crops have been shown to help maintain natural enemy abundance and diversity within the crop by providing alternative food sources and refuges from disturbance (e.g. Risch et al., 1983; Altieri & Schmidt, 1986; Andow, 1991a; Thomas et al., 1991, 1992; Dennis et al., 1994; Wratten & van Emden, 1995; Thies & Tscharntke, 1999). Moving down the assembly hierarchy, we can also identify agricultural management practices that act as abiotic filters. Insecticides, for example, generally have a broad impact across arthropod communities. The extent to which they act as a filter to alter diversity and abundance between the local and ecological species pools depends on the differential impact on individual taxa; some species may be physiologically or ecologically resistant, whereas others may be susceptible. The implications for pest-control functioning depend in particular on differential effects on herbivore and natural enemy types. Where herbivores show greater resistance and/or higher recovery rates than natural enemies, we might expect pesticide-induced resurgence. Indeed, pest resurgence following insecticide use has been recorded in many types of pests (Hardin et al., 1995). However, set in the context of our framework for the role of natural enemy diversity in pest control functioning, the effects of insecticides on control of external feeding exopterygotes are expected to be particularly striking. For these pests, we predict that control can be maintained even where there is minimal natural enemy diversity. Nonetheless, control will be lost if diversity and abundance are reduced too far. Thus, insects such as the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) may be controlled adequately by natural enemies even under intensive rice production systems in South-east Asia, but when insecticides are applied, it can become a devastating pest (Reissig et al., 1982; Heinrichs & Mochida, 1984; Kenmore et al., 1984; Heong, 1991). The mechanism for this phenomenon has been well elucidated and it seems that they key is the near complete removal of a guild of generalist predators which impose considerable mortality on planthopper populations and are sustained by alternative prey, such as detritivorous insects, at times when N. lugens is scarce (Settle et al., 1996). Nilaparvata lugens is able to escape control partly because its eggs can survive insecticide treatment, because it is highly dispersive and can recolonize rice fields quickly, and because it has a high population growth rate (Heinrichs & Mochida, 1984). In contrast, the key complex of generalist predators have no protected stages and show slow recovery because they are, on the whole, less dispersive. As important, the build-up and/or maintenance of generalist predators is greatly hampered by the insecticide-induced reductions in alternative prey populations. Again, this illustrates the interaction between mechanisms acting at different points in the assembly process. Here, pesticides act as an abiotic constraint but their significance is mediated by biotic interactions and the differential response of predators and herbivores (and crop-associated detritivores), which is determined in part by colonization processes that link back to dispersal constraints and aspects of habitat heterogeneity (over space and/or time). Finally, agricultural management also has an impact on internal community dynamics, the third filter of our assembly framework. The abundance of weeds within a crop, for example, influences the diversity and composition of natural enemy assemblages. Generally, the change from relatively diverse vegetation to virtual monoculture, which occurs with increased weed management, is associated with a decrease in diversity of natural enemy species (although not necessarily abundance) and a decrease in the relative abundance of generalist predators (Andow, 1991b; Tonhasca & Byrne, 1994). Thus, weed management may be expected to reduce levels of control of pests attacked by generalist predators and also, perhaps, those concealed species controlled by parasitoids that require alternative food sources. Similarly, returning to another example from rice production systems, management of crop residues and levels of organic matter in the soil have been demonstrated to influence the abundance of detritivores, which play an essential role in supporting early season build-up of generalist natural enemies (Settle et al., 1996). It is these natural enemies that keep later successional species such as brown planthopper in check, unless disrupted through insecticide treatment (see above). The aim of this paper was to explore whether ecological concepts developed during the study of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and community assembly, could provide insights into the impact of agricultural intensification on pest control. Although what we present here is very much a first step in addressing this issue, we believe that making an explicit link between community response to management with potential functional implications of this response represents a valuable advance towards the ability to predict and perhaps mitigate pest emergence with agricultural intensification. Our mechanistic approach to considering the relationship between natural enemy community composition and pest control functioning reveals a number of testable predictions which appear consistent with patterns reported in the literature. We are confident that further generalizations can be made concerning the relationship between natural enemy community composition and pest control functioning. Our assembly framework for examining community response also provides us with certain testable predictions. However, it is clear that interactions and feedback between processes at different points along the assembly chain make generalizations difficult. This highlights a need for further research to identify traits that govern species' response to the major elements of agricultural intensification. In this, the assembly framework provides a heuristic model for structuring the research questions, which has received little attention in the agricultural context. Already, for example, it is apparent that dispersal constraints may be extremely important to the effects of management because, as well as determining the response to changes in landscape structure, they also govern the ability of species to recover from transient environmental pressures such as insecticide treatment or soil tillage. Moreover, one recent study showed that agri-environment schemes, which tend to focus on mitigating abiotic and biotic constraints at the local scale, were ineffective at protecting biodiversity because diversity was limited by dispersal constraints at a higher level (Kleijn et al., 2001). Perhaps with more studies and a greater appreciation of the mechanisms that underpin the assembly process, useful generalizations concerning species' response to particular agricultural practices will emerge and more effective management strategies (either pest management or biodiversity management for conservation) can be developed.

The braconid Cotesia marginiventris, which parasitizes young caterpillars, is guided by herbivore-induced plant volatiles to an infested plant. On the plant, the female wasp searches for further chemical residues (kairomones) originating directly from the host. We showed that caterpillars leave minute amounts of treacherous chemical footprints while walking over a plant surface. Female wasps are able to detect these residues for up to two days after their hosts have left the site. Analyses of the caterpillar footprints revealed that these consisted of linear and monomethyl-branched alkanes as well as few minor unidentified compounds. A reconstructed blend of the major footprint compounds, consisting of linear C(21)-C(32) alkanes, induced characteristic antennation behavior. However, the artificial blend was less attractive than the original one suggesting a role for additional minor compounds in recognizing former caterpillar presence. Previous investigations using wax mutants of barley showed that the physico-chemical traits of the epicuticular leaf wax can modulate the parasitoids' response to host footprints. We hypothesize that long-chain hydrocarbons of insect and plant cuticular origin are important mediators of insect-plant interactions and believe that their role in modulating trophic cascades still awaits full appreciation.",https://openalex.org/W2046621092,7f9f07abb20049195bc2029c5c30fdbc9adf759c,0,True,0.9786697626113892,0
https://doi.org/10.3732/ajb.1600265,Here come the commensals,"Metagenomic approaches to understanding microbial symbiont communities, the microbiome, have provided an unprecedented window into the diversity of microbial organisms associated with virtually all eukaryotic hosts. However, our ignorance of what these symbionts do has been illuminated as well. Nowhere is the contrast between what we know, and what we do not know, more starkly realized than in the Kingdom Fungi with descriptions of less than 5% of the estimated 1.5 to 5 million taxa (Blackwell, 2011). While there is delight in discovery, and fortitude in the face of the cryptic nature of fungal symbioses, understanding the diversity of ecological functions for fungal symbionts remains a formidable challenge. Here, I use endophytic fungi to draw attention to the particular conundrum of commensal symbionts, symbionts that seem to do little but likely make up most of the microbial communities occupying plant and animal hosts. Endophytic fungi are those symbionts living within healthy living tissues of plants (Wilson, 1995) and thus, in terms of their interactions with the host, are best considered commensals. H. Anton de Bary in 1878 put commensals squarely in the middle of the continuum of symbioses between beneficial mutualists and detrimental parasites because commensals have few apparent direct effects on their hosts (translation by Oulhen et al., 2016). Others have argued against typecasting commensal symbioses as those in which nothing happens (Hirsh and Fujishige, 2008) or those for which we do not know what happens (Zapalski, 2011). Here, I advocate for the perspective that the commensal symbiotic habit is critical to study because commensalism enables the evolution and maintenance of tremendous diversity in ecological functions. The pervasive assumption that microbiome symbionts, including endophytic fungi, must benefit the host echoes the ""balance of nature"" perspectives found in early theoretical and conceptual models for parasites and for microbiomes. For parasites, virulence was thought maladaptive because the host on which the microbe depends is damaged and evolution toward low virulence states was predicted (reviewed by Ewald, 1983). For the human microbiome, Henderson and Wilson (1998, p. 1680) posited that diverse microbial communities ""evolved cytokine-modulating molecules to live in harmony with host mucosal surfaces"" and envisioned the microbiome as a communistic collective. In contrast, modern theory predicts that competition for host resources among multiple infecting symbionts should drive the evolution of greater virulence toward the host (reviewed by Alizon et al., 2013). Limits to virulence arise from a trade-off between parasite reproduction and parasite-induced host mortality (Anderson and May, 1982). Still, with the explosion of research on the microbiome, the concept that the ""holobiont"" (host plus microbes) evolves as a superorganism has been strongly forwarded (Bordenstein and Theis, 2015) and actively debated (Moran and Sloan, 2015). One way out of this conceptual mess may come from results that suggest a very dynamic nature of microbiome communities (Burns et al., 2016) with relatively few taxa comprising a ""core microbiome"" (Douglas and Werren, 2016). Employing evolutionary models that bring in ""third party"" interactions, we might then predict that the ever-changing landscape of microbial symbionts drives the evolution of traits such as antagonism against microbial competitors. Further, if ecological outcomes are conditional on population history and the identity of interacting species, as seems to be the case for endophytic fungi (Busby et al., 2016b), tremendous variation in traits that affect these interactions can be maintained species-wide (Bronstein, 1994; Gomulkiewicz et al., 2003). For now, we might best assume that most symbiotic species of the microbiome muddle along, pulled in different directions by the ever-changing ecological context set up by the nature of the commensal habit. Occasionally, but importantly, commensals ""escape"" and evolve more extreme symbiotic modes toward the host—mutualism and parasitism. Although somewhat hampered by an apparent publication bias toward reporting beneficial effects, a recent review on endophytic fungi suggests that these symbionts harbor extensive variation in ecological functions, including facilitation, antagonism, and neutral effects on plant parasites (Busby et al., 2016b). To think about how such variation evolves while the commensal state is stable, consider first the results of a key paper that used uing ancestral state reconstruction to trace the evolution of trophic modes in ascomycete fungi (Arnold et al., 2009). One of the most interesting results of this work is the stability and prevalence of the endophytic and endolichenic (occupying lichens) trophic modes across the phylogeny. Of the relatively few transitions accounted, shifts between parasitic and endophytic/endolichenic states are most frequent, results echoing the early predictions of Carroll (1988). What then of the mutualistic functions for endophytes so often assumed in the literature? When we focus on traits for interactions with the enemies of plants, we find several lines of evidence suggesting that the endophytic fungi actually vary considerably in their effects on plant parasites and that these effects depend on the ecological context. For example, results for well-studied taxa such as Fusarium species have demonstrated variation within species and among closely related species in their effects on plant hosts, including commensalism, parasitism, defensive mutualism, and parasite facilitation (e.g., Kaldau and Yates, 2000). Recent experimental ecological studies reveal variation within and between endophytic taxa for antagonistic and facilitative effects on a pathogen, and surprisingly, many endophytic strains have no statistically discernable phenotype (Fig. 1; Busby et al., 2016a). While endophytic fungi provide novel sources of disease control for agriculture (Ledford, 2015), the emerging picture is that endophytic fungi are commensal with respect to direct effects on their host, while harboring tremendous genetic variation for ecological functions such as interactions with other symbionts. Fungi isolated as endophytes demonstrate varying effects on the disease severity caused by a fungal rust pathogen in poplar. Approximately half of the endophytes have no apparent effect (gray), a quarter increase disease severity (facilitation, blue), and a quarter decrease severity (antagonism, orange). Isolates within individual genera vary in their effects as illustrated here for Cladosporium, Alternaria, and Penicillium (adapted from results in fig. 2 of Busby et al., 2016a). To understand the evolution and maintenance of variation for symbiont interaction traits, we might productively consider an axis of symbiont function that is distinct from the traditional continuum from parasite to mutualist. Perhaps Henderson and Wilson (1998) had it right in their emphasis on the importance of community ecological context—the direct and indirect interactions among the ever-changing members of the symbiont community are a strong force in the maintenance of the commensal state and of genetic variation within populations for interactions among symbionts (May and Nelson, 2014). How might we move forward to address these questions? The dizzying array of -omic tools has allowed extraordinary assessment of what is there, and of their genomic functions, but also raised a thicket of data that may actually obscure our view of the evolutionary process. For example, while the number of sequence reads on tiny bits of the genome is broadly acknowledged as a poor estimator of a species' abundance, no other measures using metagenomics data alone are available. Rather than being consumed with the task of building bioinformatics pipelines to nowhere, we join with Peay (2014) in calling for research addressing the basic biology of organisms. In particular, reproduction is fundamental to both ecological and evolutionary models. However, sometimes we do not even know where symbiotic organisms reproduce and for cryptic microorganisms, life history traits can be difficult, but not impossible to estimate (Bruns et al., 2014). There is hope—many fungi are culturable with effort, and there is increasing interest in maintaining microbial culture collections as a basis for experimentation and taxonomic description (Bai et al., 2015). Consequently, the door is opening for experimental study of interactions among diverse organisms that can provide quantitative results for phenotypic variation in ecological and symbiotic functions (Busby et al., 2016a). Together with demographic and population genetic studies (Oono et al., 2014), such studies will illuminate evolutionary processes generating and maintaining variation for interactions among symbionts and between symbionts and their hosts.

This study aimed to elucidate how seed traits influence infestation dynamics and species interactions, focusing on acorn weevils infesting Quercus mongolica. Species identification and clarification of their evolutionary relationships within the Curculio genus were performed through phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene sequences. The seed infestation patterns were assessed by comparing the infestation rates across various seed size classes. Furthermore, the correlations between the seed morphological traits (length, width, aspect ratio, and weight) and weevil abundance were analyzed. The phylogenetic results revealed well-supported monophyletic clades corresponding to Curculio arakawai and Curculio sikkimensis. This confirmed the clear genetic separation between these two distinct weevil species, thereby substantiating the divergence observed in weevil populations correlated with different seed hosts. The infestation patterns revealed the association of weevil species-specific preferences with seed size: C. arakawai predominantly infested larger acorn seeds, whereas C. sikkimensis predominantly infested smaller acorn seeds. C. sikkimensis favored smaller ones. Both species exhibited positive correlations between abundance and seed length and width in larger seeds; however, the seed weight displayed no significant effect. These results indicate niche differentiation mediated by seed size and morphology, which likely reduced interspecific competition and facilitated coexistence. This study elucidates species-specific host selection patterns in acorn weevils and highlights acorn traits as crucial factors shaping seed predator assemblages. The findings provide valuable insights for developing targeted pest management strategies and supporting sustainable oak forest regeneration.",https://openalex.org/W4411351047,07808f9ca2a186d5d649471839944b8f2ca81202,0,True,0.9715970754623413,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/een.12667,Pay it forward: refuse dump from leaf‐cutting ants promotes caterpillar digestive performance by increasing plant nitrogen content,"1. The activity of soil‐disturbing animals that increase soil nutrients can affect the carbon : nitrogen (C : N) ratio of plants, which, in turn, may determine the transfer of energy and nutrients through higher trophic levels. However, the strength and sign of this indirect effect depend on whether enhanced nutrient substrates increase plant foliar nutrients and/or plant defensive traits. 2. We investigated how the nutrient‐rich refuse dumps of the leaf‐cutting ant Acromyrmex lobicornis, as a result of their direct effects on thistles, indirectly impact the growth rate and digestive performance of a generalist chewing herbivore. We also included the application of commercial fertilisers to test whether the enhanced soil nutrients comprises the mechanism behind the impact of refuse dumps on the upward cascade effects. 3. Thistles growing on nutrient‐rich substrates (i.e. ant refuse dumps and fertilised soil) had more and larger leaves, up to 80% lower C : N ratios, and higher physical defences compared to plants growing on steppe soil. Caterpillars showed an enhanced digestive performance and growth rate when feed on nutrient‐rich plants and were able to adjust the C : N ratio of their excretion to regulate the relative acquisition of nutrients. 4. The positive effect of nutrient‐rich substrates on caterpillar feeding efficiency suggest that the enhanced nutritional quality of the thistles could compensate for the negative effects of the increased physical defences. The results of the present study indicate how organisms that increase soil nutrient availability may diminish the stoichiometric constraints at the base of food chains, enhancing the development and growth rate of herbivores and, thus, indirectly mediating plant–herbivore interactions.",https://openalex.org/W2885504066,32b56d4d8881ee073002050d2e3a4303309e3f7f,0,True,0.9632174968719482,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/bes2.1766,Ghosts of Competition and Predation Past: Why Ecologists Value Negative Over Positive Interactions,"In this lake, where competitions are fierce and continuous beyond any parallel in the worst periods of human history; […]; where robbery and murder and the deadly tyranny of strength over weakness are the unvarying rule; where what we call wrong-doing is always triumphant, and what we call goodness would be immediately fatal to its possessor, – even here, out of these hard conditions, an order has been evolved which is the best conceivable without a total change in the conditions themselves; an equilibrium has been reached and is steadily maintained that actually accomplishes for all the parties involved the greatest good which the circumstances will at all permit. In a system where life is the universal good, but the destruction of life the well nigh universal occupation, an order has spontaneously risen which constantly tends to maintain life at the highest limit, – a limit far higher, in fact, with respect to both quality and quantity, than would be possible in the absence of this destructive conflict. (Forbes 1887:87.) Phenomena in ecology are diverse. One would expect diverse phenomena to be investigated from diverse theoretical perspectives, but there are only a few dominant perspectives in modern ecology. Both negative and positive interactions occur in nature, and the importance and impact of both vary in time and space. It is not true, for instance, that competition and predation are the major forces affecting the fates of all communities and populations (cf. Hairston 1989). Nevertheless, ecologists have shown more interest in negative than in positive interactions. Let us consider how diverse phenomena have been explained in terms of competition or predation. Examples include the diversity and structure of communities (Paine 1966, Diamond 1975, Menge and Sutherland 1976), latitudinal gradients in body size (McNab 1971), the evolution of body size (Dawkins and Krebs 1979), the latitudinal diversity gradient (Dobzhansky 1950, Menge and Sutherland 1976), the diversity–stability rule (Lehman and Tilman 2000), trait evolution (Brown and Wilson 1956), and many phenomena about insular or isolated populations and communities (Grant 1966, Lomolino 1985). There is no list of phenomena explained in terms of positive interactions that is close in diversity to those ecologists have explained in terms of negative interactions. Positive interactions refer to cooperation (+/+), symbiosis (+/+) or (+/0), mutualism (+/+), and commensalism (+/0), in which at least one participant (an organism, population, or species) receives positive effects from the interaction without negatively affecting the other participant. In the case of negative or antagonistic interactions such as competition (−/−) or predation (+/−), at least one participant negatively affects the other. I conducted a preliminary analysis by searching for the hits of six common interaction terms from articles published in journals (n = 11). The terms in question were the same as those given below. I used the publisher's web pages, if available, or JSTOR (searching titles, abstract, and keywords for all available years). Table 1 and the graphic depiction in Fig. 1 report the data: Across different journals, competition and predation dominate in terms of numbers of published articles making reference to them vis-à-vis positive interactions. Aggregate data on numbers of hits for search terms in journals, as shown in Table 1, are not informative about dominance and its reasons. It reveals nothing about the relative frequencies of the search terms as research topics. It is also silent on the issue of whether the dominance has changed over time. Data were collected from five journals via JSTOR. I searched for hits for the following six interaction terms from articles published in journals: ""competition,"" ""predation,"" ""cooperation,"" ""symbiosis,"" ""mutualism,"" and ""commensalism."" The dataset contains more than 50,000 published articles searched for the above six search terms, covering a period of publication history ranging from 60 to 100 years. I chose a 10-year period as the interval for the collection and comparison of data. The search covered the abstracts, titles, and key words of all the articles published in the journal in question. These data were collected and recorded as hits for each search term, and in other words, the number of articles published in the journal within a certain period that made explicit reference to a search term. The resulting data are recorded in Tables 2–6 for each journal. Given that the number of articles published in journals varies over time, the number of hits for a search term in a specific journal during a certain period (data in Tables 2–6) does not in itself give the right sort of information about its relative prevalence, currently or previously, in that journal. The numbers of articles making reference to search terms were converted into estimations of relative frequencies (i.e., the number articles that count as hits for the search term/the number of all published articles in the journal). These relative frequencies, expressed as percentages, are recorded in Tables 2–6. The reason for making this conversion was to obtain dimensionless numbers that could be compared, which facilitated comparison of the relative importance or centrality of search terms qua research topics in different journals and different periods. The requirements for a journal to be counted as a data source included having a relative long history of data available online (at least from the year 1950), most of the articles being in English, and allowing estimation of the number of all published articles within a certain period for the whole period under investigation. Quite a few journals fulfilled these requirements, including those listed in Table 1, such as Plant Ecology. Two journals that are general in scope and three that are more specific were chosen as data sources. The choice of Oikos and Ecology as the general-focus journals related partly to the fact that the former is published by an American and the latter by a European ecological society: Any differences between European and American ecology should become visible when the data are compared. As a note, Ecology, established in 1920, was originally entitled Plant World. The focus in the new journal, at least during the first decade, was on the ecology of plants. Two plant journals, the Journal of Ecology and the American Journal of Botany, and one animal journal, the Journal of Animal Ecology, were chosen as additional sources. The data obtained could be compared both among these three journals and to data from the general-focus journals. Moreover, plant and animal journals typically have long publication histories. I give another reason for choosing journals specializing in plant and animal ecology in the Discussion. Not all the interaction terms were included in the search, as I decided to concentrate on the most common. Amensalism (−/0) and parasitism (+/−) were left out, for instance. Of the search terms used, ""cooperation"" is probably the most unreliable. Not only it is an umbrella term that could cover several specific positive interactions, it is likely that not all the hits reported in the tables refer to cooperation as a biological phenomenon (see Table 6 and the next section). Thus, the numbers of hits could be inflated. The opposite is true of ""predation."" The term does not capture all instances of the phenomenon, and thus, the number of hits could be deflated (see Table 2 and the next section). ""Symbiosis"" is another umbrella term, which I included among positive interactions. There is a close connection between symbiosis and mutualism/commensalism, albeit certain authors include parasitism and even predation under symbiotic interactions (Sapp 2004, Martin and Schwab 2013). No consensus exists as to its definition, save that symbiotic interactions take place in proximity and/or are persistent. To calculate the relative frequencies of the search terms, it was necessary to estimate the total number of articles published in journals during each period included in the search. There is no generally accepted method for estimating these numbers, apart from counting all the journal articles. This would be too onerous and as prone to errors as alternative methods. Nor was it possible to obtain these data online for all the periods under investigation, and therefore, I used other methods. In certain cases, I chose a year that represented the average annual number of issues/page numbers over a decade, counted the number of articles published that year, and multiplied that number by 10. In certain other cases, it was necessary to count the number of articles from a certain year as representative of two or three years (and to multiply accordingly), then to count the number of articles published in another year as representative of other years during that period (and to multiply that number accordingly), and finally to add the numbers. In the 20th century, there was substantial variance in the journals in terms of issue, page, and article numbers. In certain journals, the number of published articles per issue increased a great deal during the time period, whereas the increase was more moderate in others. In fact, in some cases there was a decrease, despite an increase in page numbers in the issues (the articles are longer). Thus, the total numbers of articles published in a journal during a 10-year period are estimations and are reported in the last column of Tables 2–6. I may have over- or underestimated them. Note that an over- or underestimation would similarly bias all the calculated values based on these estimations within that period, that is, percentages in Tables 2–6. Over- or underestimation of the total number of articles would affect the calculated percentages unevenly, however: The higher the calculated percentage based on an over- or underestimation, the further the calculated value is from the real value. The variance in the percentages, over- or underestimated by 10%, is between circa ±5% and ±3% for the highest calculated percentages reported below, and between circa ±2% and ±0% percent for the calculated percentages under 20 reported below. I investigated several journals to guard against over- and underestimation errors. Given that the data points to consistent trends among the terms searched in different journals and across different periods, I doubt there are serious errors as far as estimation bias is concerned. Many of the results I discuss are robust, based on data from different journals. Nevertheless, the percentage calculations are based on estimations. Accordingly, the percentages in Tables 2–6 should be considered indicative of general trends rather than exact and accurate values. The numbers of hits for the search terms and their percentages (Tables 2–6) within a given period in a journal are not additive: One article could count as a hit for any number of search terms. It was beyond the scope of the present study to investigate any tendency for certain search terms to occur together, even though the data indicate that many articles make reference to both competition and predation. The data collected show how competition and predation have dominated ecology. The numbers and percentages of published articles referring to negative interactions rose up until the 1980s or 1990s. During these two decades, between 50% and 60% of all articles published in journals made reference to competition and/or predation, whereas the corresponding numbers for positive interactions were clearly much lower (generally <10%). Even though the respective percentages have recently gone down, competition and predation still dominate vis-à-vis positive interaction in terms of numbers and percentages (Tables 2–6, Figs. 2-6). The results reported should not be interpreted as indicating that the high percentages for competition and predation are indicative of the truth or evidential support. It is quite likely that many of the articles that count as hits are critical, questioning or finding no data to support these theories. What the results do indicate, however, is where the main research interests and foci in ecology have been, and what are marginal phenomena. The main finding is that there has been bias in ecology favoring negative over positive interactions in published articles, and there still is. Just a cursory glance at the tables reveals that even if a search term had the highest number of hits during one of the investigated periods in a particular journal, it does not mean that the relative frequency was the highest during that period. For example, although ""competition"" typically had the highest number of hits in the last period of investigation for each journal, the relative frequency tended to decrease. Let us compare Table 3. The highest number of hits for competition in Oikos (1,592) occurs between 2000 and 2009. Because the total number of published articles in the journal rose from 1,840 (in 1990–1999) to 2,600 (in 2000–2009), the number of articles referring to competition (i.e., hits) also rose. However, the number of articles referring to competition fell in percentage terms from 67 (in 1990–1999) to 61 (in 2000–2009). It is the relative frequency of search terms (percentages) rather than the numbers of hits that is the most relevant. Data on numbers of hits alone might give misleading information about the relative frequency or importance of search terms qua research topics. The top three percentages for competition are 67 (in Oikos and the Journal of Ecology, Tables 3, 5), 61 (in Ecology, Table 2), and 53 (in the Journal of Animal Ecology, Table 4); and for predation are 55 (in Oikos, Table 3), 52 (in the Journal of Animal Ecology, Table 4), and 39 (in Ecology, Table 2). The respective percentages for positive interactions are nowhere near these levels. Negative interactions dominate (see Figs. 2-6, which visualize the data from Tables 2–6). This is especially clear in the Journal of Animal Ecology, with high percentages for both predation and competition and low percentages for positive interactions (Table 4, Fig. 4). The trends are similar in Ecology (Table 2, Fig. 2), Oikos (Table 3, Fig. 3), and the Journal of Ecology, with high percentages for competition in certain periods and relatively moderate percentages for predation (Table 5, Fig. 5), and high percentages for competition during certain periods in the American Journal of Botany (Table 6, Fig. 6). Either competition or predation dominate almost consistently throughout the investigated periods in both the numbers of published articles and percentages (Tables 2–6, Figs. 2-6). The time-series data show an interesting pattern of dominance. The percentages (but not always the numbers) of articles making reference to competition and predation tended to drop (Figs. 7, 8). This trend began in the 1980s or 1990s in all the journals except the Journal of Ecology, which may have been a ""late bloomer."" There was an almost monotonic increase in percentage hits for competition and predation in practically all the journals investigated, beginning from the 1950s or 1960s and ending in the 1980s or 1990s. Since then, the percentages have come down (e.g., in Ecology the highest percentage for competition was 61 in the 1980s, and 46 in the latest period covered; the respective numbers for predation are 39 and 26 (Table 2). The difference is less steep but clear enough in other journals: cf. 67% and 61%, respectively, in Oikos for competition, and 55% and 49% for predation (Table 3). It is thus possible that the same pattern is unfolding in the Journal of Ecology: Given that no data were available for the years 2010–2019, it was not possible to verify whether the percentage hits for competition and predation kept on rising, leveled off, or reduced. Nevertheless, the latest percentage for competition (67) in the Journal of Ecology is very high, although the highest percentage for predation (21) remains moderate (Table 5). The highest percentages for positive interactions lag far behind those for negative interactions, the highest being for cooperation (e.g., 21% and 16% in Ecology, see Table 2). The numbers and percentages could be overinflated in this case and in general. For instance, ""cooperation"" yielded 84 (1920–1929) and 102 (1930–1939) hits in the American Journal of Botany (Table 6). These numbers appeared to be too high. Having checked the hits, I found out that 70–80% had nothing to do with cooperation as a biological phenomenon. Consequently, these were removed and the corrected numbers were 25 (1920–1929) and 37 (1930–1939). In this case, the uncorrected percentages for cooperation would have been 19 (1920–1929) and 14 (1930–1939). The corrected percentages are 5% in both cases. The second highest percentages for positive interactions are for mutualism: 13 in Ecology (Table 2), 9 in Oikos (Table 3), and 8 in the Journal of Ecology (Table 5). With regard to symbiosis the highest percentages are 5 in the Journal of Ecology (Table 5), 4 in Ecology (Table 2) and the American Journal of Botany (Table 6), and 3 in Oikos (Table 3). Commensalism has been a marginally investigated phenomenon, with a highest hit rate of 2% (Ecology, Table 2). In general, it is mentioned in less than 1% of all articles published in the journals. The low numbers are curious, given that commensalism could be considered the rule rather than the exception in nature. Many ecologists believed that negative interactions are important and deserve more attention than other interactions, since they give structure to communities (see Introduction for references). The idea was debated and contested, for instance, in the context of null models/hypotheses (see Epistemic values). Moreover, evidence for the idea is equivocal (Connell 1983, Hairston 1989). Even if the idea of negative interactions giving structure to communities was generally true, commensalistic interactions play major roles in sustaining and maintaining communities (e.g., detritivory and the oxygen production by green plants). There are thus no reasons to treat commensalistic interactions less prevalent nor less important in functions or effects than other interactions. The time-series trend for positive interactions differs from that for negative interactions. Both the numbers of articles making reference to and the percentages for positive interactions are currently rising in the journals investigated, more clearly in some than in others. Cooperation shows the least clear trend in this regard, but at least in three journals there is a small rising percentage trajectory (see Fig. 9; the numbers in Ecology vary too much). With regard to symbiosis (Fig. 10) and mutualism (Fig. 11), there is a clear recent trend toward higher percentages in all the journals investigated, with the exception of the Journal of Animal Ecology with regard to symbiosis. Another exception is commensalism (no trend, see Fig. 12), which I will exclude from discussion from this point. The trend toward higher percentage hits for positive interactions (and higher numbers of articles making reference to them) seems to have begun in the 1970s or 1980s. Even in a journal that appears to be most obviously favoring negative interactions, namely the Journal of Animal Ecology, in which there is the least steep recent percentage reduction for competition and predation as well (from 53 to 50 for competition and from 52 to 45 for predation), the positive interactions are on the rise in terms of both numbers and percentages of published articles (Table 4, Fig. 4). The only partial exception is the Journal of Ecology, in which there has been a recent percentage rise for both negative and positive interactions (Fig. 5). The study period covers 60–100 years of publication history in the journals concerned. There is almost no period in which competition, at least, was not dominant. In some journals, both competition and predation are dominant (Figs. 2-4), whereas in others it is just competition (Figs. 5, 6). There are two exceptions. The first, the dominance of cooperation, could be an apparent exception, attributable to the methods used. The second, a lesser dominance of competition and/or predation in the plant journals, is probably real and indicative of the reasons for the dominance of negative interactions. In Ecology, from 1920 to 1959 (Table 2, Fig. 2), the percentages for cooperation are higher than those for predation. Similarly in the American Journal of Botany, cooperation dominates competition early on (1920–1949), and predation up until the 1980s (Table 6, Fig. 6). This exception could be a spurious result of the methodology used: The hits for ""cooperation"" could be overinflated (as explained above) and the hits for ""predation"" might be underrepresented in both cases. As for the latter, there are no hits for ""predation"" for the years 1920–1929 in Ecology, for instance, despite the fact that the phenomenon was a featured topic in the articles published during the period (Table 2). It may be that the term became popular later on. To remain consistent in my searches and results, I will continue to use ""predation"" with reference to all the journals and periods, even if it results in a somewhat underestimated representation of the phenomenon in the published articles. It is worth noting that even if the reported numbers and percentages for ""predation"" are underestimated and the reported numbers and percentages for ""cooperation"" are overestimated, the main result is reinforced: Competition and predation dominate in ecology more than my data indicate. The second exception, as mentioned, concerns the low percentages for both competition and predation in the American Journal of Botany up until the 1970s or 1980s (Table 6, Fig. 6). Negative interactions were not clearly dominant in the journal before this period: In fact, they are clearly less dominant in this journal than in any other (Fig. 13). Moreover, there is no clear dominance of predation in this journal. I doubt that this is an artifact; the period is too long, and the pattern is too consistent. Moreover, the percentages for positive interactions are not exceptionally low. The pattern is similar in another plant journal, the Journal of Ecology, although it is not as clear (Table 5, Fig. 5). Competition seems to dominate, although the percentages are relatively low up until the two or three latest decades. Moreover, the percentages for predation also remain consistently low. There is a contrast here between the plant journals and the animal journal, the Journal of Animal Ecology, in which the percentages for competition and predation are consistently high and those for positive interactions are low (Fig. 4). Thus, there seems to be some pattern in the dominance of negative interactions: It is more pronounced in certain journals than in others. It is generally assumed that the reason for the dominance of theories should lie in their epistemic (or cognitive) values (cf. Douglas 2011). Epistemically, valuable theories are supported by and fit to diverse data, unify phenomena, provide good explanations and accurate predictions, are simple and fruitful, and so on. These advantages, which many ecologists also think of as epistemic virtues or values (see Marquet et al. 2014), could constitute valid scientific reasons for the dominance of competition and predation theories. Simplicity is a notoriously difficult concept to define. Moreover, simplicity of a theory could be a virtue for different reasons. I doubt there is much in competition or predation theories to be defended in terms of simplicity. Change the sign of one or two of the parameters in a competition or predation model and the result is a model for mutualism or commensalism. This model is, according to most definitions of simplicity, as simple as the original one. In fact, models of negative interactions have become more complex over time. As one learns about the conditions under which competition models, for instance, do not hold in nature (luxury competition, environmental heterogeneity, intermediate disturbances, and so on), more and more conditions and assumptions are added to cover these instances. Even if it were the case that competition and predation theories were simpler than alternative theories, simplicity is not necessarily a truth-conductive virtue of a theory. Nature may be complex. In general, ecology has a moderate historical record in making accurate predictions (cf. Hall 1988, Peters 1991, Doak et al. 2008, Houlahan et al. 2017). The above holds for competition and predation theories as well. Hutchinson's (1961) ""The Paradox of the Plankton"" is illustrative. The paradox is, as the plankton case showed, that exactly the opposite of what competition theory predicted should be true was true: a high diversity of species with similar niches coexisting in a habitat in which resources are very limiting and limited. Yet, competition theory was not discarded. On the contrary: Hutchison tried to save it on the grounds of environmental heterogeneity. Had ecologists treated the plankton case as a crucial experiment, the data should have falsified the theory. Undoubtedly, the main reason for its non-rejection was that it was already treated as dominant. It is unquestionable that there are more empirical data on competition and predation than on positive interactions. The amount of data alone provides no justification for the dominance, however. In the first place, this could be the consequence of dominance rather than the cause. Second, it is not true that data unequivocally support these theories, as more and more apparently disconfirming evidence has accumulated. Thus, it is debatable whether these theories are better supported by data than alternative theories. It is possible, for instance, that the majority of articles reported as hits for competition and predation in my dataset turn out to concern cases that were devoid of supporting data, or even had data disconfirming these theories. Nor it is true that competition and predation theory fit data about phenomena better than alternative theories. As the null model/hypothesis debate has shown, phenomena that competition theory have been used to account for could equally well be explained by alternative theories that have nothing do with competition (cf. Connor and Simberloff 1979, Strong et al. 1979, Hastings 1987). In other words, alternative theories fit the same data equally well. Competition and predation theories appear to be fruitful, having been applied to diverse phenomena. They therefore unify many phenomena within a few theoretical perspectives. However, potential fruitfulness and unificatory power are not proper epistemic values. Non- and pseudo-scientific theories may be extremely fruitful and potentially unifying. Moreover, the real fruitfulness and unificatory power of competition and predation theories is questionable. In the case of phenomena given as examples in the Introduction, it was discovered later on that many of the explanations derived from such theories were not correct and other theories were needed to arrive at better or more plausible explanations. Finally, it is possible that the apparent fruitfulness of competition and predation theories in explaining and unifying diverse phenomena is the consequence of theoretical dominance in the first place, rather than the cause. The above should not be understood as criticism of competition or predation theories. If there is criticism of them in this article, it is the following comparative claim: These theories dominate despite there being obvious epistemic reasons for the dominance vis-à-vis alternative theories. Moreover, if this is true, some other, non-scientific factors might explain the dominance. I will now introduce a neglected aspect and explanation: Dominance can be attributed to accidental historical facts. My alternative hypothesis is that competition and predation theories have dominated in ecology at least partly because of the predominance of male researchers in the past. To support this hypothesis one would need data about the history of ecology and especially on the roles and fates of female ecologists in the last century. In what follows, I rely on data collected by Langenheim (1988, 1996), which mainly concerns American women ecologists in the 20th century. I was unable to find comparable data from Europe. For this reason, I focus on general trends and assume that they are generalizable (cf. Figs. 2, 3: no major differences in the research topics in terms of data or emphasis between American and European journals for the years the two can be compared). Among those obtaining a PhD in ecology or a related discipline during 1900–1920, a large percentage were women, particularly in certain universities/departments in the United States. The numbers and percentages declined during 1930–1950. Following the women's liberation and environmental movements of the 1960s and, especially, the 1970s, the numbers of women with a PhD and other degrees began to rise considerably. Yet, it was not until the 1990s that there was rough gender equality among members of the Ecological Society of America aged under 25 years. Most of the women who were awarded a PhD before the 1960s were not given research positions. With a few notable exceptions, women with a PhD or any other degree became teachers or research assistants, notably to their husbands. Thus, throughout over half of the existence of modern ecology, most of those who published articles and worked as researchers were men. To get some data, I checked the authors' gender in articles published in Ecology: Not a single author could be identified as a woman in 1920 (four authors remained unidentified as to gender), and in 1950, there were four women authors (f",https://openalex.org/W3081141055,8f5881484d8baca647d190908df71d60f7ef75ae,0,True,0.9938395023345947,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12398,Co‐evolution of foraging behaviour in herbivores and their natural enemies predicts multifunctionality of herbivore‐induced plant volatiles,"Summary Herbivorous arthropods often induce phenotypic changes in plants of terrestrial systems, which include increased direct resistance to herbivores. In addition, infested plants release quantitatively and qualitatively different volatiles from those of uninfested plants, which are so‐called herbivore‐induced plant volatiles ( HIPV s). Due to HIPV s, plants are more conspicuous to herbivorous arthropods and their natural enemies (carnivorous arthropods) than uninfested plants, thus acting as foraging cues in tri‐trophic systems. Intriguingly, herbivore and natural enemy responses to HIPV s are highly diverse. Whether they are attracted or repelled by HIPV s depend on the plant–herbivore–natural enemy species combination, suggesting a HIPV multifunctionality. We hypothesized that co‐evolutionary diversification of foraging strategies in herbivores and natural enemies, where arthropods adapted to diverse plant ecological traits, served to explain HIPV multifunctionality. We developed a food chain model of plant–herbivore–natural enemy to test our hypothesis, where plants exhibited three different states and different apparency (uninfested &lt; lightly infested &lt; highly infested) and quality (lightly infested &gt; highly infested). The shifts between plant states were mediated by herbivore life cycle, interactions among herbivores, natural enemies and plant reproduction. The natural enemy evolutionary stable strategy ( ESS ) was predicted to choose the lightly and heavily infested plants in broad ranges of induced direct resistance and plant apparency ( HIPV levels), implying that HIPV s acted as the induced indirect resistance. The corresponding herbivore ESS was to choose (or avoid) HIPV s when HIPV levels were low (or high). When the induced direct resistance was very high and thus herbivore quality was low, natural enemies tended to avoid increased HIPV s with increasing herbivory levels. This was associated with herbivore ESS choice for HIPV s, leading to intraspecific enemy‐free space. These predicted ESS diversities explained observed herbivore and natural enemy responses to HIPV s in several contrasting plant systems, including willow trees, lima bean and wild tobacco. Our findings suggest that non‐lethal herbivory and variations in induced plant responses are key mechanisms for evolutionary diversification of animal foraging behaviour and thus structure of ecological networks.",https://openalex.org/W1997053148,8aaa84a93355d80ef3586fecc49c6b59ccf78b40,0,True,0.972164511680603,0
https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9792,Life history and habitat do not mediate temporal changes in body size due to climate warming in rodents,"Temporal changes in body size have been documented in a number of vertebrate species, with different contested drivers being suggested to explain these changes. Among these are climate warming, resource availability, competition, predation risk, human population density, island effects and others. Both life history traits (intrinsic factors such as lifespan and reproductive rate) and habitat (extrinsic factors such as vegetation type, latitude and elevation) are expected to mediate the existence of a significant temporal response of body size to climate warming but neither have been widely investigated. Using examples of rodents, we predicted that both life history traits and habitat might explain the probability of temporal response using two tests of this hypothesis. Firstly, taking advantage of new data from museum collections spanning the last 106 years, we investigated geographical and temporal variation in cranial size (a proxy for body size) in six African rodent species of two murid subfamilies (Murinae and Gerbillinae) of varying life history, degree of commensality, range size, and habitat. Two species, the commensal Mastomys natalensis, and the non-commensal Otomys unisulcatus showed significant temporal changes in body size, with the former increasing and the latter decreasing, in relation with climate warming. Commensalism could explain the increase in size with time due to steadily increasing food availability through increased agricultural production. Apart from this, we found no general life history or habitat predictors of a temporal response in African rodents. Secondly, in order to further test this hypothesis, we incorporated our data into a meta-analysis based on published literature on temporal responses in rodents, resulting in a combined dataset for 50 species from seven families worldwide; among these, 29 species showed no significant change, eight showed a significant increase in size, and 13 showed a decline in size. Using a binomial logistic regression model for these metadata, we found that none of our chosen life history or habitat predictors could significantly explain the probability of a temporal response to climate warming, reinforcing our conclusion based on the more detailed data from the six African species.",https://openalex.org/W3087766078,4399fcf6da6546e6c28af32b1c14e138b96ec2e5,0,True,0.9595338106155396,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2904,Disturbance size and frequency mediate the coexistence of benthic spatial competitors,"Disturbance plays a key role in structuring community dynamics and is central to conservation and natural resource management. However, ecologists continue to debate the importance of disturbance for species coexistence and biodiversity. Such disagreements may arise in part because few studies have examined variation across multiple dimensions of disturbance (e.g., size, frequency) and how the effects of disturbance may depend on species attributes (e.g., competitiveness, dispersal ability). In light of this gap in understanding and accelerating changes to disturbance regimes worldwide, we used spatial population models to explore how disturbance size and frequency interact with species attributes to affect coexistence between seagrass (Zostera marina) and colonial burrowing shrimp (Neotrypaea californiensis) that compete for benthic space in estuaries throughout the west coast of North America. By simulating population dynamics under a range of ecologically relevant disturbance regimes, we discovered that intermediate disturbance (approximately 9-23% of landscape area per year) to short-dispersing, competitively dominant seagrass can foster long-term stable coexistence with broad-dispersing, competitively inferior burrowing shrimp via the spatial storage effect. When holding the total extent of disturbance constant, the individual size and annual frequency of disturbance altered landscape spatial patterns and mediated the dominance and evenness of competitors. Many small disturbances favored short-dispersing seagrass by hastening recolonization, whereas fewer large disturbances benefited rapidly colonizing burrowing shrimp by creating temporary refugia from competition. As a result, large, infrequent disturbances generally improved the strength and stability of coexistence relative to small, frequent disturbances. Regardless of disturbance size or frequency, the dispersal ability of the superior competitor (seagrass), the competitive ability of the inferior competitor (burrowing shrimp), and the reproduction and survival of both species strongly influenced population abundances and coexistence. Our results show that disturbance size and frequency can promote or constrain coexistence by altering the duration of time over which inferior competitors can escape competitive exclusion, particularly when colonization depends on the spatial pattern of disturbance due to dispersal traits. For coastal managers and conservation practitioners, our findings indicate that reducing particularly large disturbances may help conserve globally imperiled seagrass meadows and control burrowing shrimp colonies that can threaten the viability of oyster aquaculture.",https://openalex.org/W2975996018,e7d0fd3c13b253fd4ccede50698faf6505e2505a,0,True,0.982232391834259,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.14298,Towards closer integration between ecology and evolution,"Developing deeper links between ecology and evolution is not a new idea and has been advocating since at least the 1950s (Futuyma, 1986), but most 20th-century attempts can be considered more as rapprochement than actual integration (Huneman, 2019 for a detailed historical review). However, based on early isolated insights (e.g. Antonovics, 1976; Pimentel, 1961), the idea has been revivified over the last two decades, around the concepts of eco-evolutionary dynamics and feedbacks (Hendry, 2017). Significant efforts have indeed been made to percolate concepts and ideas between the two fields, especially across biodiversity levels (e.g. Hendry, 2017; Leibold & Chase, 2017; Loreau, 2010; Vellend, 2016), even if (i) more has been done at the population to community level than for higher levels of ecological organization (e.g. including ecosystem functioning) and (ii) analyses of reciprocal feedbacks remain rare compared to mainstream research in either field. The number of studies claiming to be ‘eco–evo’ has risen sharply (Bassar et al., 2021), even if most of these studies actually represent classical ‘eco’ or ‘evo’ approaches, raising the question of what eco–evo really is. The definition proposed by Bassar et al. (2021; see also Hendry, 2017, chapter 1) may serve as a baseline, built on the assumption that ecological and evolutionary processes occur at the same timescales because this allows for true eco-evolutionary dynamics (EED) and feedbacks. Fast global change (e.g. temperature increase; IPCC, 2023) leading to enhanced selective pressure is certainly a good reason for considering such EED, highlighting the fact that fast evolutionary dynamics can match fast environmental change (and fast biodiversity loss; Diaz & Malhi, 2022). From this definition, the debate can (and must) develop to integrate concepts, ideas and practices of ecology and evolution into EED, and this is what is proposed in this special issue (general outline in Figure 1), revivifying this debate by considering several themes: the first relies on biodiversity itself, with the idea of including all biodiversity levels (from molecule to biomes), all branches of the tree of life, and some overlooked aspects of variability. The other themes are concerned with extending the temporal (and implicitly spatial) frame in which biodiversity unfolds, considering the full range of forces and processes acting on biodiversity, and lastly revisiting concepts and extending models. Rather than commenting sequentially on each paper in this special issue, we have chosen a summary to gather the ideas and suggestions presented around these themes—all the more so as several articles contribute to multiple themes (Figure 1). They are not presented in order of importance, although some papers offer more general perspectives than others. Of course, this special issue does not exhaust the field of possibilities. Each paper suggests several avenues for further research, and we also mention (Conclusion) some additional research directions that are not considered here, but worth exploring. Biodiversity is classically considered hierarchically from molecules to ecosystems (or even biomes). While somewhat of a caricature, there is some truth in the view that the penetrance of evolutionary theory is much stronger at the level of the smallest entities (genes, populations), while ecological theories are generally more concerned with more complex entities (communities, ecosystems) (see the top left part in Figure 1). However, biodiversity levels are connected by multifarious links (e.g. selection, predation, variable environments), and EED can play a role at all levels with feedback between levels (Hendry, 2017; Loreau, 2010). This is a strong incentive to consider these dynamics across biodiversity levels. A first entry is proposed in this special issue by Yamamichi, Letten, and Schreiber (2023) who conduct an analysis of models in population genetics and community ecology following the general approach advocated by Vellend (2016): there are indeed clear parallels between, for example, selection and competition or gene flow and dispersal. They focus on the critical role of temporally fluctuating environments in maintaining variation both within and among species through fast EED. Drawing on Chesson (2000)'s theory of coexistence, they begin from a simple lottery model used in both fields to explore how the temporal storage effect affects both genetic and species diversity, incrementally complexifying this model to account for ‘reality’. This pedagogic approach may certainly be open beyond the storage effect to consider for example the respective role of genetic and ecological drift (Yamamichi, Letten, & Schreiber, 2023). The second entry, proposed by Calcagno et al. (2023), is to consider several biodiversity levels simultaneously through trophic chains. What constrains their complexity, and especially their length, is a central issue in ecology (Calcagno et al., 2011) and can be envisaged as a tension between top-down (e.g. predation) and habitat-selection effects in a metacommunity context, space being critical to account for their maintenance (Calcagno et al., 2011). Calcagno et al. (2023) introduce an ounce of evolution in this perspective, considering that dispersal rates can evolve under mutation pressure; this leads in general to longer food chains, depending on, for example, the competition-colonization trade-off among species. However, the benefit of evolution decreases when considering increasingly higher levels in food chains. Here, only dispersal evolves, and Calcagno et al. (2023) consider several worthy perspectives, such as for instance more complex descriptions of individual phenotypes than mean trait value. How dispersal evolution itself may affect the perturbation regime may also be worth taking into account for EED. A second aspect is to reconsider how the tree of life is dealt with in EED studies as well as in both ecology and evolution in general (Figure 1). To put it bluntly, microbes are overlooked, although they represent the bulk of biodiversity, and most studies are conducted on multicellular organisms (Loreau et al., 2023; Martiny et al., 2023). The point is not just that this is ‘unfair’, but that looking at the world from a microbial perspective drastically changes the meaning of eco-evolutionary dynamics. Indeed, let us imagine what the theories of ecology and evolution would have been if they had been written before the rise of multicellular organisms: disentangling ecology from evolution is difficult in the microbial realm if it even has any meaning. Indeed, the species concept poorly applies, and horizontal gene transfers are common, even if microbial Operational Taxonomic Units within communities are separated by much larger distances than in macro-organisms (Martiny et al., 2023). The fundamental differences made in macro-organisms between changes in species abundance and in genotype frequencies are therefore blurred. Microbes, no less than macro-organisms, can respond to environmental change with solutions going from rapid evolution to broad-scale community shifts, going up to those biogeochemical processes governing ecosystem functioning and dynamics, which implies a strong potential to lead to EED (Martiny et al., 2023). However, they are not indistinct players collectively expressing functional redundancy, and we should now dig deeper into their ecology and evolution in natural environments to fully make sense of their role. Recent work has shown that it is for example possible to quantify dispersal and evaluate its impact on decomposition processes in soils (Martiny et al., 2023). The last aspect regarding biodiversity is some facets of variability, within and among species, that have been overlooked in EED (Figure 1). Variability is needed for evolution to proceed, and its maintenance is a central issue in both evolution and ecology, in particular as a resilience mechanism under unpredictable environmental conditions. Variance is certainly a key concept in ecological studies above the species level but has been essentially considered among species (Violle et al., 2012). Yet, we are not short of studies analysing trait variance within species in population biology. However, studies assessing rates of phenotypic change focus on population mean trait values, while their variance might be as significant for EED. Contributing to filling this gap is the goal of Sanderson et al. (2023), based on a compilation of both trait means and variances measured in context of environmental changes. Means and variances are globally positively correlated, and the distribution of genetic and phenotypic variances is also very similar. No general patterns for phenotypic variance emerge among different types of environmental changes, or traits, rendering prediction of future phenotypic trends difficult. Sanderson et al. (2023) conclude that much has still to be done to build more ambitious datasets on a wide range of organisms, but also to link this variance to environmental variance, a pre-requisite to EED studies. Part of this variance is due to phenotypic plasticity, and here again, a plethora of studies have been conducted (Pfennig, 2021). However, how phenotypic plasticity can contribute to EED through propagating effects in ecological networks remains to be evaluated. Gómez et al. (2023) explore more specifically in this special issue how plasticity contributes to expand or shift the interaction niche, or even cause the colonization of new niches. This may lead to the topology of ecological networks being rewired, an aspect that is open to empirical evaluation through metrics such as nestedness or modularity. That individual plasticity may percolate to affect various key characteristics of networks confronted with environmental perturbations, such as resistance to invasions, is an interesting perspective (Gómez et al., 2023). Whether plasticity may be defined at network scale and submitted to selection is more contentious. A full analysis should also specify how plasticity may drive EED in actual cases. Perhaps, more ambitious is the idea of considering stoichiometry as a key part of variability (El-Sabaawi et al., 2023)—ecological stoichiometry studies how the relative supply and demand of essential elements, such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, influence biological interactions (Elser et al., 2000). It contributed largely to our understanding of ecosystem functioning (Van de Waal et al., 2018), but not so much to EED. Here, El-Sabaawi et al. (2023) propose to develop organismal stoichiometry to access an understudied aspect of the phenotype. This ‘elemental phenotype’ integrates body elemental content, and how these elements are acquired, assimilated, allocated or released and exhibits much intraspecific variation, leading to selective pressures. Beyond providing a direct link between population biology and fluxes of matter in ecosystems, this idea opens connections to the notion of functional traits (Loranger et al. 2016), also considered integrators between ecological and evolutionary processes (Hendry, 2017), as well as to a whole body of evolutionary theory on resource allocation (Charnov, 1993; Stearns, 1992). The ‘elemental phenotype’ perspective includes connections with species interactions as well, and therefore, a wide range of ecological processes through cascading effects in trophic chains. Bassar et al. (2021) argued that genuine eco-evo dynamics can only unfold when ecology and evolution proceed at the same timescale. However, they implicitly assumed that both were fast because they focused on ongoing processes. Fronhofer et al. (2023) enlarge the picture by extending the idea to any timescale and considering the dynamics of biological systems in a two-dimensional space—the two axes representing respectively the speed of ecology and evolution (Figure 1). In this framework, ecology and evolution sensu stricto can be redefined by their relative speed with regard to evolution and ecology respectively (Figure 1). More importantly, this means that change of states in Figure 1 can occur whenever modulators modify ecological and evolutionary rates—such modulators can be factors external to the biological systems (e.g. environmental temperature) or internal to them (e.g. new genetic variation, itself influenced by external factors). EED may therefore emerge when rate modulators synchronize the speed of ecology and evolution. This framework also extends Hutchinson (1965)'s analogy (the ecological theatre and the evolutionary play): time is the theatre in which ecology and evolution are two interacting players. Fronhofer et al. (2023)'s proposal undermines the usual ‘slow evolution/fast ecology' wisdom that served for decades as a ‘good reason’ for not considering ecology and evolution together. It also calls for reconsidering the ‘time-scale separation’ classically used in EED models based, for example, on the adaptive dynamics approach (see Calcagno et al., 2023). This approach considers weak selection on traits and assumes that evolution is much slower than ecology in order to facilitate model analysis (Calcagno et al., 2023; Lion et al., 2023; Yamamichi, Letten, & Schreiber, 2023). The new approach to trait modelling—oligomorphic dynamics—by Lion et al. (2023, detailed below) is a way of overcoming this problem while addressing the question of eco–evo prediction at temporal scales beyond the few generations that quantitative genetics can offer. A significant contribution, no doubt, to predicting EED under a regime of rapid environmental change. Yamamichi, Ellner, and Hairston (2023) argue that evolution in EED studies has too often focused on a reduced set of forces (i.e. strong selection, negligible phenotypic variances, large genetic effects on ecological variables; see Bassar et al., 2021). They discuss several aspects that should be deepened, insisting on the role of mutation and genetic drift. For example, we know that deleterious mutations can drive populations to extinction (mutational meltdown; Lynch et al., 1995), but the role of genetic drift remains to be sorted out to fully understand how ‘evolution may save’ populations when environmental variation drives down demography (evolutionary rescue). Yamamichi, Ellner, and Hairston (2023) also point out that too much emphasis has been put on directional and balancing selection (Figure 1), and not enough on disruptive selection (see also Lion et al., 2023). Assuming similar speeds for evolution and ecology, an open question is how lineage diversification (or even fusing after diversification) is affected by disruptive selection, both in the short- and long-term, providing a link between microevolution and macroevolution (see also Fronhofer et al., 2023). As mentioned above, temporal variation (and the storage effect; Yamamichi, Letten, & Schreiber, 2023) and phenotypic plasticity (Gómez et al., 2023) are also critical processes to be considered. The modulators of ecological and evolutionary rates introduced by Fronhofer et al. (2023) provide a general umbrella term to account for the fact that we should consider not only those forces and processes but also the speed at which they may change. In this approach to EDD through forces and processes (Figure 1), Kim et al. (2023) propose another, more applied, angle of attack, based on an arguably contentious issue, that is, the use of gene drive technology to introduce genes of interest into natural populations. The argument is simple: the spread of genes should be so fast that it can occur over timescales similar to many ecological processes, as in situations where there is strong selection. Kim et al. (2023) describe the key forces and processes that should be accounted for in future studies, for example, population structure or the rise of gene drive in other species on the evolutionary side and environmental variation on the ecological side. The strong economic pressure to release these technologies from the laboratory into the field certainly calls for an EED approach to better understand and manage the associated risks. Considering other forces and processes in the previous section (Yamamichi, Ellner, & Hairston, 2023) is certainly a call to develop new models of EED. We already saw the conceptual gain derived from considering the possibility that the colonization rate can evolve in models of food-chain length (Calcagno et al., 2023), and how models can be derived from analogous forces at both the population and community levels to account for the temporal storage effect (Yamamichi, Letten, & Schreiber, 2023). What Lion et al. (2023) propose is perhaps even more ambitious by opening a door to integrate the two major theoretical approaches used to model traits and their evolution, namely adaptive dynamics (AD) and quantitative genetics (QG). In a simplified presentation, QG assumes that traits have a normal distribution, and AD often results in bivariate distributions. To get rid of the Gaussian straitjacket and drawing on Sasaki and Dieckmann (2011), Lion et al. (2023) introduce ‘oligomorphic dynamics’—the basic idea is to decompose a multimodal trait distribution into a sum of narrow unimodal distributions, each peak corresponding to a morph and being characterized by its frequency and statistical moments (Figure 1). This elegant approach, developed here using simple models, displays several advantages, among others the possibility to consider EED at much larger timescale than QG or to account for the dynamical nature of genetic variance. It can also take into account population regulation through frequency- and density-dependent selection induced by environmental change (see also Yamamichi, Letten, & Schreiber, 2023). Lion et al. (2023) also suggest that this approach should facilitate a much tighter integration between eco-evolutionary theory and empirical data. Much exciting work in perspective! Advances in the eco-evolutionary field could also come from the judicious extension of concepts from ecology and evolution. For example, Nosil et al. (2021)) suggested that resilience, a concept borrowed from ecosystem studies (Holling, 1973), can fruitfully be used to analyse the stability of evolutionary systems. Here, Loreau et al. (2023) go the other way around by showing that adaptation, a concept typically associated with evolutionary theory, could be considered above the species level (Figure 1). The idea is to generalize adaptation to any process that results in improved performance as a response to environmental change in a multilevel hierarchical perspective. Loreau et al. (2023) consider facets of this certainly contentious idea, such as how to measure performance (fitness in evolutionary parlance) and its connection with group and multi-level selection. Perhaps, the idea might be even more relevant to unicellular organisms, given the blurred boundaries between their ecology and evolution (Loreau et al., 2023; Martiny et al., 2023). The border between ecology and evolution is a vast domain, and this special issue of course did not explore it fully. Here, we sketch out a few further directions and themes that could fruitfully be pursued. First, technological tools (e.g. omics and environmental sensors/probes) used by evolutionary biologists and ecologists are serving as common objects for a dialogue between the two communities. Although they were not covered explicitly here, the idea runs through most papers of the special issue. Second, fitness is the currency used in evolutionary biology and energy that is used by the most functional parts of ecology. Rather abstract frameworks have been proposed to link fitness and energy (entropy) in evolutionary biology (e.g. Frank, 2009). The approach of Brown et al. (2018), connecting energy use, traits and environment, is open to empirical evaluation, and might be pursued for understanding EED. Third, micro-organisms represent interactive interfaces between macro-organisms and their environment, which is encapsulated in the holobiont concept (Simon et al., 2019). Both evolutionary and ecological paradigms are required to make sense of holobiont dynamics with echoes here in the contributions of Loreau et al. (2010) and Martiny et al. (2023), for example, on the notion of transmission units. Last, but not least, biodiversity management in a world of very fast and deleterious environmental changes should harness an eco-evolutionary framework and perspective (Sarrazin & Leconte, 2016), not only to manage the current problems but also to offer some hope for the future.

https://doi.org/10.3390/ani13071264,Factor in Fear: Interference Competition in Polymorphic Spadefoot Toad Tadpoles and Its Potential Role in Disruptive Selection,"Disruptive selection arises when extreme phenotypes have a fitness advantage compared to more-intermediate phenotypes. Theory and evidence suggest that intraspecific resource competition is a key driver of disruptive selection. However, while competition can be indirect (exploitative) or direct (interference), the role of interference competition in disruptive selection has not been tested, and most models of disruptive selection assume exploitative competition. We experimentally investigated whether the type of competition affects the outcome of competitive interactions using a system where disruptive selection is common: Mexican spadefoot toads (Spea multiplicata). Spea tadpoles develop into alternative resource-use phenotypes: carnivores, which consume fairy shrimp and other tadpoles, and omnivores, which feed on algae and detritus. Tadpoles intermediate in phenotype have low fitness when competition is intense, as they are outcompeted by the specialized tadpoles. Our experiments revealed that the presence of carnivores significantly decreased foraging behavior in intermediate tadpoles, and that intermediate tadpoles had significantly lower growth rates in interference competition treatments with carnivores but not with omnivores. Interference competition may therefore be important in driving disruptive selection. As carnivore tadpoles are also cannibalistic, the 'fear' effect may have a greater impact on intermediate tadpoles than exploitative competition alone, similarly to non-consumptive effects in predator-prey or intraguild relationships.",https://openalex.org/W4362669251,b5ac8daef6d22fbbfe15215579c037fa58f7e5c7,0,True,0.9853305816650391,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.1507,The evolution of invasiveness: a mechanistic view of trade‐offs involving defenses,"The question of why some introduced species become invasive has captivated ecologists for more than 60 years (Elton, 1958). Many factors might contribute to invasiveness, but one of the most long-standing and persistently compelling hypotheses is that invaders benefit from escaping their enemies (Keane and Crawley, 2002). Human-mediated species introductions are inherently long-distance dispersal events, and we know that only some components of a source community are established in new locations. The species that do establish will necessarily experience a novel set of biotic interactions (Mitchell et al., 2006). If these novel interactions result in reduced fitness losses to enemies, then an incipient invader would benefit immediately, and the resulting patterns of selection could also favor evolutionary reallocation of resources away from defenses and into traits that increase reproduction and/or spread, further increasing invasiveness (Fig. 1) (Blossey and Nötzold, 1995; Joshi and Vrieling, 2005). Whether an evolutionary reduction in defenses has led to an increase in invasiveness has remained an open question in the field of invasion biology, despite many challenges and mixed support. The hypothesis was first articulated as the evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA), which combined enemy escape with optimal defense theory to predict that plant invaders will evolve increased allocation to vegetative growth or reproduction (whichever maximizes fitness in the new environment) in the absence of herbivores in their recipient communities (Blossey and Nötzold, 1995). The EICA hypothesis has since been expanded to include a broader array of enemies and greater complexity of defense interactions, but the core concept of invaders evolving increased competitive ability at the cost of defenses has remained (Joshi and Vrieling, 2005; Mitchell et al., 2006). A number of individual studies have found evidence that supports predictions of EICA, but others have not, and meta-analyses of these studies have themselves come to different conclusions about the degree of support for EICA (e.g., Chun et al., 2010; Felker-Quinn et al., 2013; Rotter and Holeski, 2018). In this essay, we argue that to test the compelling evolutionary hypotheses underlying EICA, we will be better served by reconsidering what we are measuring and how the evolution of defense traits and subsequent trade-offs can be expected to contribute to invasiveness. When Blossey and Nötzhold (1995) first proposed the EICA, they used the term ""competitive ability"" but noted that ""competitive abilities can be maximized by increasing vegetative growth or reproductive efforts depending on which is more important for success in a new environment"" (p. 887). It is essential to realize that this description, particularly by including reproduction, is really about the traits that contribute to fitness (""success"") of a lineage, not about traits that maximize competitive abilities in terms of contests between individual plants (e.g., competition coefficients). This distinction is critical for how we test the ideas underlying EICA and for how we identify invasiveness and its evolution. While invasive plants were originally characterized as species that succeed by outcompeting other plants (Elton, 1958), no doubt leading to the choice of terms in EICA, we now recognize that invasions can be the product of a variety of niche opportunities in a recipient community, which may or may not involve an important role for competitive abilities (Shea and Chesson, 2002). From the standpoint of understanding which species establish, rise to high abundance, and spread (the stages of invasion), what we should be most concerned with is not competitive ability per se but fitness traits more generally (i.e., traits related to survival and reproduction) in the new environment (Fig. 2). Reproduction (sexual or asexual) might be especially important for invasiveness, due to its relationship with both population growth and spread (Jelbert et al., 2019). Notably, in the most recent meta-analysis of EICA-type studies, Rotter and Holeski (2018) found that invading plant populations showed evidence of evolutionary increases in several growth and reproductive traits along with loss of defenses, but that these differences were strongest for reproductive traits. In seeking to test whether invasiveness has evolved as a result of enemy escape, EICA was predicated upon a simple trade-off between growth/reproduction and defense traits (Blossey and Nötzold, 1995). The regulatory mechanisms that govern plant resource use and development are being elucidated in increasing detail, and these studies generally do support the existence of deeply conserved trade-offs between these functions (Huot et al., 2014). Defense responses mediated by signalling pathways involving salicylic acid (SA), jasmonate (JA), and pathogen-associated molecular-pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) have been studied in detail and observed to result in inhibition of growth hormones and growth pathways, involving changes in transcription, translation, protein secretion, and/or the movement of carbon and nitrogen resources. This regulatory crosstalk means that even in the absence of resource limitation, defense functions can come at the cost of growth. For example, recent work has shown that JA inhibition of growth in Arabidopsis is eliminated in a mutant lacking a suite of transcriptional repressors and the photoreceptor phyB, indicating that a conserved transcriptional network and not resource limitation is responsible for growth inhibition (Campos et al., 2016). While many patterns of growth–defense trade-offs have been clearly demonstrated, less clear is how this crosstalk will scale up to whole-plant investments in defense vs. growth and fitness traits in a natural environment (Smakowska et al., 2016). A primary reason that we might not observe evolutionary changes associated with a simple trade-off between growth and defense is that plants possess many different types of defenses against their enemies, including resistance in the form of structural traits, constitutive and inducible chemical compounds, and tolerance in the form of regrowth strategies, all with the potential to operate differently in different tissues (Smakowska et al., 2016). The multifaceted nature of defense means that different defense investments could be shifted independently toward growth without a generalized loss of ""defense"" in an invasion (Joshi and Vrieling, 2005). Often, these defense investments co-occur within the same plant and are expected to trade-off against one another (Strauss et al., 2002). A comprehensive meta-analysis of multiple types of plant resistance found no overall negative association between multiple defensive traits in a plant (Koricheva et al., 2004), however, highlighting a need for a mechanistic understanding of how plants apportion resources among multiple defense investments. For example, a trade-off has classically been predicted to occur between plant tolerance (regrowth) and resistance chemistry (Leimu and Koricheva, 2006). Meta-analyses have failed to detect a negative association between tolerance and resistance (Leimu and Koricheva, 2006), however, and recent work on the mechanistic basis of tolerance has reiterated that we should revise our expectations of how tolerance and resistance can be related (Mesa et al., 2017). Specifically, some plants rapidly compensate for tissue loss through increases in the ploidy of regrowing tissues (endoreduplication), which facilitates an increase in the expression of genes and pathways that promote rapid regrowth following herbivory (Paige, 2018). Critically, recent studies in Arabidopsis thaliana have found that plant tolerance and resistance are positively correlated, because resources for both endoreduplication and secondary metabolites are produced within the same pathway (Mesa et al., 2017). Under this mechanism, a potential invader would be constrained to alter investments in both defenses concurrently, even if one was no longer needed in a given context. A recent study of invasive vines found that plant tolerance was better than resistance as a predictor of invasiveness (Ashton and Lerdau, 2007), suggesting that the relationship between these different investments could be important for invaders specifically. Colautti and Lau (2015) noted that one reason that invaders might adapt very rapidly to new locations could be that the different types of biotic interactions are simplified. By escaping some enemies, invaders might experience fewer antagonistic sources of selection and respond efficiently to the resulting directional selection, particularly if different types of defense are mechanistically coupled but experience different directions of selection in the source environment. Regardless, understanding how defense investments evolve in invaders is likely to shed light on long-standing questions about how plants evolve defense strategies under complex ecological conditions (Strauss et al., 2002) and about the conditions that favor the evolution of increased invasiveness (Fig. 2). Uncovering how defense traits are mechanistically related will be essential for generating predictions for invader evolution. Tests are needed to determine how different types of defenses trade-off against one another and against growth and fitness (Fig. 2). Understanding these more complex allocation networks within plants will allow us to more appropriately test whether changes in enemy communities do indeed create opportunities for evolutionary changes that facilitate invasion.

https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13182,Towards a mechanistic understanding of global change ecology,"The 21st century is, by most metrics, a great time to be a human. Relative to other periods in human history, life expectancies, living standards and educational levels are the highest they have ever been. But these advances in human welfare have come at great cost to the nonhuman cohabitants of our planet. CO2 levels continue to increase, as do global temperatures, altering global rainfall patterns, fire frequencies and many other aspects of the environment that directly affect communities and ecosystems. Our changing climate currently receives extensive attention in the media and in the ecological literature, but it is just one of the many ways that humans influence communities and ecosystems. Human land-use (Figure 1), resulting in habitat destruction, fragmentation and urbanization, is one of the most significant, probably the most significant, causes of biodiversity loss globally (Haddad et al., 2015; Newbold et al., 2015). Other human-mediated changes to communities, such as the introduction of novel species (Powell, Chase, & Knight, 2013), high inputs of nitrogen (Bobbink et al., 2010), agricultural intensification (Fahrig et al., 2011) and interactions among these, have dramatically changed patterns of biodiversity and ecological processes on our planet. To understand how organisms, communities and ecosystems are responding, and will respond, to the array environmental changes caused by human modification of the planet, researchers have taken a variety of approaches. One approach is to model relationships between climatic variation and current or past species distributions and extrapolate from these models to predict how populations and communities will change under different climate change scenarios. But scenario-driven forecasts of this type take decades to test and are limited to predicting how climatic niches and large-scale habitat distributions will change in response to climate (Franklin, Serra-Diaz, Syphard, & Regan, 2016). Predicting how global change will affect individual species, biodiversity within ecosystems, and the services those ecosystems provide, requires understanding of the specific mechanisms by which human-caused ecological changes influence ecological interactions that affect ecosystem function. In this issue of Functional Ecology, we present a collection of review and perspective papers that examine the mechanisms underlying how organisms, communities and ecosystems respond to a variety of global changes. This special feature grew out of a symposium held at the annual meeting of the British Ecological Society in Liverpool, UK, in December 2016. That symposium, a celebration of Functional Ecology's 30th anniversary as a journal and the publication of volume 30 of the journal, brought together members of the Functional Ecology editorial board to discuss current issues in global change ecology (these presentations are available online at The nine papers in this special feature—contributions from members of our editorial board that participated in that symposium, plus a few that could not attend the event—have the collective goal of moving us closer to a mechanistic understanding of how ecological patterns and processes are, and will be, affected by global change. Our special feature begins with an exploration of the effects of changing climate on species distributions. Although species distributions have always changed over time due to natural ecological processes, the rate and direction of change observed today in response to climate change is unprecedented (Chen, Hill, Ohlemüller, Roy, & Thomas, 2011). Diamond (2018) starts off our special feature by exploring the extent to which evolutionary history (phylogeny) predicts range shifts in response to climate change, and what this phylogenetic signal can teach us about how and why species ranges expand or contract. Of course, traits that influence an organism's ability to tolerate environmental conditions at the edges of their range are not static—they can be phenotypically plastic within generations and evolve across generations. Diamond thus explores the influences of phenotypic plasticity in stress tolerance on range shifts, focusing on thermal tolerance, a variable that has been demonstrated to explain variation in the distributions of many species. She finds that species with low plasticity in thermal tolerance exhibit much greater shifts in their ranges with climate change (at the leading edge of their expansion), suggesting that the range edges for these species largely track local climates. In contrast, species that are more plastic in thermal tolerance were less likely to experience a range shift in response to climate change, suggesting that their range limits were determined by other environmental variables. One specific category of species ranges that has fascinated ecologists for generations is that of tree lines, the latitudinal and altitudinal boundaries beyond which trees are unable to survive. Because mean soil temperatures are commonly predictive of tree line locations, global warming is expected to cause tree line shifts. Although tree lines do often shift as predicted, there are many cases in which tree lines do not shift as predicted, suggesting that other variables mediate seedling establishment and limit tree line shifts (Harsch, Hulme, McGlone, & Duncan, 2009). In this issue, Lett and Dorrepaal (2018) review our understanding of how environmental factors influence alpine and arctic tree lines, and perform a meta-analysis exploring the relative influences of temperature, water availability, nutrients, light and surrounding vegetation (among other variables) on tree seedling establishment at the tree line. They find that temperature can limit seed germination and seedling growth, but such effects vary widely across species and stages of development. Other environmental factors likewise had variable effects across species, with interactions common. Together, the studies reviewed by Lett and Dorrepaal (2018) demonstrate that temperature, although an important contributor to seedling establishment at tree lines, is just one of many important variables influencing tree line location. Changes in species distributions, either through natural range expansions or introductions to new areas (species invasions), influence the composition of communities, interactions among species and patterns of biodiversity. We lead off our reviews exploring the community-level biodiversity consequences of global change with a paper by Paine, Deasey, and Duthie (2018) that discusses techniques for predicting changes in community dynamics over time frames during which anthropogenic changes likely influence most communities. Paine et al. (2018) review how modern coexistence theory based on the estimation of demographic parameters can be used to predict community dynamics. They suggest that considering ""hard"" functional traits (those most predictive of vital rates) and physiological tolerances can improve predictions of community dynamics in a wide variety of ecosystems. We continue exploring how global change influences biodiversity within communities with two studies that consider interactions between plants and their herbivores. First, Pellissier et al. (2018) consider how herbivory helps maintain plant functional diversity in the face of climate change affecting alpine plant communities. Combining a mathematical model with a case study comparing populations along an elevational gradient in the Swiss Alps, they suggest that trade-offs between traits—those that mediate resistance to herbivory, responses to temperature and competition among species—will facilitate species coexistence and maintain high functional diversity in alpine communities as the climate changes. In the next paper, Koricheva and Hayes (2018) flip the direction of causality and explore how diversity in plant communities affects arthropod diversity at higher trophic levels. Rather than examining species diversity, they examine genetic variation within plant species. Loss of genetic variation within populations is common following human disturbance, such as when populations are fragmented or reduced in size. Genetic diversity can be especially impoverished in human-managed communities, for example, when communities are monocultures, such as in agricultural and urban settings. Yet only recently has genetic diversity within populations been recognized to affect ecological dynamics (e.g. Bailey et al., 2009). Koricheva and Hayes explore how such declines in genetic diversity within plant species can influence biodiversity in arthropods, focusing on herbivores and their natural enemies. They find that within-species genetic diversity can indeed influence biodiversity at higher trophic levels—higher plant genetic diversity begets higher arthropod richness and abundance—with effects of genetic diversity being of similar magnitude to effects of species diversity for some diversity metrics (e.g. arthropod species richness). Food webs are, of course, much more complicated than just herbivores eating plants. They are complex networks of interactions among organisms. Thus, any environmental perturbation that impacts individual species, or interactions among species, can have effects that cascade throughout the community. In her contribution, El-Sabaawi (2018) examines the effects of one particularly large set of perturbations caused by humans—urbanization. Urbanization changes climate (such as temperature, water and light availability), habitat structure (by increasing fragmentation), species composition and the presence of environmental contaminants, all of which can affect individual species, ecological interactions and food web structure (Hahs & Evans, 2015). El-Sabaawi finds that food webs are fundamentally changed by urbanization, with specialists and apex predators generally performing poorly and omnivores (species with flexible diets) often flourishing. But her review also highlights many exceptions to these general patterns, and thus a need for community-level studies that go beyond examining single species, simple interactions or describing food web topology in urban habitats. While urbanization can dramatically alter large regions of the planet over short time periods, few events can alter a landscape as rapidly as wildfire. Having spent many of my formative years as a scientist in the western United States where fires are an annual occurrence, and having witnessed a large-scale wildfire that required evacuation of my research laboratory, I have first-hand appreciation for the speed and extent to which fires alter communities. Wildfires have always occurred naturally, but global climate change and habitat alteration have increased the frequency, size and severity of fires. Davis, Higuera, and Sala (2018) tackle the question of how our changing climate will influence postfire vegetation dynamics, which in turn influences future fire activity. They provide an overview of the demographic filters that influence how forests will respond to changes in climate and wildfires, using western North American forests for illustration. Their model identifies the types of species that should be winners or losers as fire frequency and severity increase, making clear predictions for how communities impacted by fire will change over time. Our final two papers turn to the topic of how alterations in the availability of two essential resources, water and nitrogen, affect community composition and ecosystem function. Griffin-Nolan et al. (2018) use a response–effect trait framework to identify potential explanations for the observed (poor) relationships between plant traits and water availability. They conclude that commonly measured plant traits that predict plant growth and NPP dynamics are not suitable for predicting species responses to changing water availability; instead, traits that more directly relate to hydraulic transport and water-use efficiency are more promising for predicting community and ecosystem responses to changes in water availability. Human activities have elevated nitrogen deposition globally, with the effects greatest in areas with the largest human population densities. Our special feature concludes with Stevens, David, and Storkey (2018) exploring how N deposition affects communities, both at the primary producer level and at less-well understood higher trophic levels. Similar to the conclusions of El-Sabaawi for the effects of urbanization discussed above, Stevens and colleagues predict that species using a more limited range of food sources will be more greatly impacted by N deposition. Negative effects of nitrogen on these species can be caused by changes in resource quality, abundance and phenology. However, they note that clear gaps in the literature limit our ability to predict responses of many taxa, notably large herbivores and pollinators, despite the respective conservation and agricultural significance of those groups. Understanding the mechanisms underlying organism, community and ecosystem responses to global change is one of the most pressing problems, and fastest growing areas, in modern ecology. It is clearly impossible in just nine manuscripts to capture the wide diversity of important environmental changes and ecological interactions influenced by human activities. But I hope these nine manuscripts highlight some of the advances being made, and types of problems being addressed, by studies that take mechanistic approaches to understanding global change ecology. Enabling a mechanistic understanding of ecological pattern and process has defined the scope of Functional Ecology for its first 30 years as a scientific journal and will continue to do so in the Anthropocene. My hope, as a scientist honoured to edit Functional Ecology, is that exciting new research developments, and syntheses of important problems in global change ecology, will continue to populate the pages of this journal in the future. For it is only through understanding that we can hope to solve the problems facing our planet today and tomorrow. I thank the British Ecological Society for supporting the 2016 symposium that gave rise to this special feature. That symposium was co-organized with Emilie Aimé, Managing Editor of Functional Ecology.

https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12790,Carnivore identity mediates the effects of light and nutrients on aquatic food‐chain efficiency,"Summary Food chain efficiency ( FCE ), the proportion of primary production converted to production of the top trophic level, can influence several ecosystem services as well as the biodiversity and productivity of each trophic level. Aquatic FCE is affected by light and nutrient supply, largely via effects on primary producer stoichiometry that propagate to herbivores and then carnivores. Here, we test the hypothesis that the identity of the top carnivore mediates FCE responses to changes in light and nutrient supply. We conducted a large‐scale, 6‐week mesocosm experiment in which we manipulated light and nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) supply and the identity of the carnivore in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design. We quantified the response of FCE and the biomass and productivity of each trophic level (phytoplankton, zooplankton, and carnivore). We used an invertebrate, Chaoborus americanus, and a vertebrate, bluegill sunfish ( Lepomis macrochirus ), as the two carnivores in this study because of the large difference in phosphorus requirements between these taxa. We predicted that bluegill would be more likely to experience P‐limitation due to higher P requirements, and hence that FCE would be lower in the bluegill treatments than in the Chaoborus treatments. We also expected the interactive effect of light and nutrients to be stronger in the bluegill treatments. Within a carnivore treatment, we predicted highest FCE under low light and high nutrient supply, as these conditions would produce high‐quality (low C:nutrient) algal resources. In contrast, if food quantity had a stronger effect on carnivore production than food quality, carnivore production would increase proportionally with primary production, thus FCE would be similar across light and nutrient treatments. Carnivore identity mediated the effects of light and nutrients on FCE, and as predicted FCE was higher in food chains with Chaoborus than with bluegill. Also as predicted, FCE in Chaoborus treatments was higher under low light. However, FCE in bluegill treatments was higher at high light supply, opposite to our predictions. In addition, bluegill production increased proportionally with primary production, while Chaoborus production was not correlated with primary production, suggesting that bluegill responded more strongly to food quantity than to food quality. These carnivore taxa differ in traits other than body stoichiometry, for example, feeding selectivity, which may have contributed to the observed differences in FCE between carnivores. Comparison of our results with those from previous experiments showed that FCE responds similarly to light and nutrients in food chains with Chaoborus and larval fish (gizzard shad: Clupeidae), but very differently in food chains with bluegill. These findings warrant further investigation into the mechanisms related to carnivore identity (e.g., developmental stage, feeding selectivity) underlying these responses, and highlight the importance of considering both top‐down and bottom‐up effects when evaluating food chain responses to changing light and nutrient conditions.",https://openalex.org/W2466611595,5970dbec52808f21a3874c99cd31a6d8655747f1,0,True,0.9791667461395264,0
https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.1999.00359.x,Systemic acquired resistance: available information and open ecological questions,"1 How widespread is SAR within the plant kingdom? 2 Does SAR fit into the framework provided by established theories on plant (anti-herbivore) defence? 3 What are the allocation costs and ultimately the fitness costs of SAR? 4 Why is SAR an inducible and not a constitutive defence? 5 What is the advantage of a defence induced systemically by a single pathogen, which then gives resistance against many others that are not yet causing any problems and which probably may never challenge the regarded plant? 6 Are there any functional or physiological relations between SAR and other biological interactions, for example mutualisms between plants and micro-organisms? 7 Do plants exist in nature that are older than seedlings that have not already been induced? The many excellent reviews on the molecular aspects of SAR include those by Ryals et al. (1994), Hunt & Ryals (1996), Hunt et al. (1996), Ryals et al. (1996) and Schneider et al. (1996), and only a short overview is given here, before considering the ecological possibilities. Indeed, simply applying established ecological theories and models to the phenomenon (for example, examining SAR within the concept of fitness costs) may shed new light on this important type of plant defence. Infection by bacteria, viruses or fungi, induces many plant species to synthesize a signal at the site of infection, which then spreads systemically throughout the plant. This leads to the expression of a broad-spectrum, long-lasting immunity in both infected and non-infected plant parts. Initially, this phenomenon was thought to be ubiquitous, and resistance was thought to be equally effective against many different pathogens (Ryals et al. 1994; Jackson & Taylor 1996 and literature cited therein), but more recent studies suggest intra-and interspecific variability (see later). The systemic reaction involves the production of chitinases, β-(1,3)-glucanases, lysozyme, permatins, and at least two more classes of so-called pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins (Ryals et al. 1996; Schneider et al. 1996) which may protect against further infections. Chitinases are particularly effective against several pathogenic fungi (Boller et al. 1983; Schlumbaum et al. 1986; Sahai & Manocha 1993), and the efficacy of SAR against a variety of bacteria, viruses and fungi has also been demonstrated convincingly (Boller et al. 1983; Hoffland et al. 1996; Anfoka & Buchenauer 1997; further literature cited in Schneider et al. 1996). A main characteristic of SAR is that the induced defence does not depend directly on the type of inducing pathogen. For example, pretreatment with bacteria (Pseudomonas fluorescens strain WCS417) protected radish (Raphanus sativus, Brassicaceae) against a fungal root pathogen as well as a bacterial and two different fungal leaf pathogens (Hoffland et al. 1996), and inoculation of tomato plants with tobacco necrosis virus elicited resistance against the fungus Phytophthora infestans (Oomyceta) (Anfoka & Buchenauer 1997). The PR proteins produced in response to pathogens can also be induced by the plant hormone ethylene (Linthorst et al. 1996), or by stress, including mechanical wounding (Ignatius et al. 1994). SAR can also be induced experimentally by the application of certain chemicals, most notably salicylic acid (SA) and benzothiadiazole (Friedrich et al. 1996; Görlach et al. 1996; Lawton et al. 1996). Although the induction of chitinases and β-(1,3)-glucanases by the stress hormone ethylene has been shown in several plant species (Boller et al. 1983; Vierheilig et al. 1994 and literature cited therein), the pathway leading from a first and locally restricted infection to the systemic response is not yet well understood. SA seems to be involved in this transduction (Malamy et al. 1990; Métraux et al. 1990; Delaney et al. 1994; Hunt et al. 1996; Thulke & Conrath 1998) but it may not be the primary transported signal (Rasmussen et al. 1991; Vernooij et al. 1994; Willits & Ryals 1998), although SA can indeed be synthesized in one leaf and translocated to the next (Shualev et al. 1995; Mölders et al. 1996). It has also been shown to inhibit catalase activity, and elevated levels of H2O2 could thus function as the second messenger (Chen et al. 1993). However, the absence of any increase of H2O2 in uninfected leaves at the onset of SAR gene activation, and the phytotoxic levels needed for SAR induction (Hunt et al. 1996; discussed in Schneider et al. 1996), together with the high reactivity of H2O2, make it rather improbable that this component is translocated over large distances. Although parts of the signalling pathway seem to be highly conserved in evolution, and thus occur in all plant species so far investigated (e.g. in Arabidopsis as well as in tobacco), the type, amount and time–course of the response depends on the precise identity of both partners (Schneider & Ullrich 1994; Schneider et al. 1996; Botha et al. 1998). Thus SAR gene expression was first detected in tobacco about 6 days after inoculation (Ryals et al. 1994), but as early as 7 hours after a primary infection in cucumber (Schneider et al. 1996): in both species, patterns in the activity of the various hydrolytic enzymes depended on the inducer (Schneider & Ullrich 1994). Variation occurs in particular with respect to the efficacy of defence. For example, Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes vary in their resistance to cauliflower mosaic virus (Callaway et al. 1996), and nim 1 mutants (non-inducible immunity) differ in PR-1 production, while eds (enhanced disease susceptibility) mutants have distinguishable phenotypes with respect to the susceptibility to pathogenic bacteria. Some lines of barley differ in their ability to produce chitinases and glucanases (Ignatius et al. 1994; Hunt & Ryals 1996; Hunt et al. 1997; Rogers & Ausubel 1997; Ryals et al. 1997; Shah et al. 1997). The various chitinases that occur within the same species may differ in location, activity, chitin-binding property and catalytic mechanism, and thus allow the plant to match many different requirements (Sahai & Manocha 1993; Iseli et al. 1996). β-(1,3)-glucanase, ribosome-inactivating proteins and permatins may also occur in the form of several isozymes (Darnetty et al. 1993). Genes for some proteins belonging to the PR-1 subfamily may be expressed continuously, at least in shoot meristems and trichomes (Tornero et al. 1997). As shoot meristems are especially valuable and vulnerable, whereas trichomes in most plants are involved in defence mechanisms, this finding may be interpreted as a hint on relevant costs of SAR (see below). Of 45 research articles or meeting abstracts on SAR published during 1996 and 1997, 24 were conducted using Arabidopsis or tobacco as the model organism, another 13 referred to cucumber, potato or tomato, and only eight presented data derived from other species; the 25 earlier papers listed by Schneider et al. (1996) describe a total of 17 plant species. A similarly restricted picture is apparent from the literature on chitinase (overviewed by Sahai & Manocha 1993). The vast majority of these species are short-lived and fast-growing annuals, but known SAR markers, direct measurements of enzyme activities, or bioassays could be used to investigate the frequency of SAR in a wide range of species. So far, predominantly chitinase activity has been demonstrated for plants with other life histories, e.g. Urtica dioca (a chitinase of stinging nettle was characterized genetically by Lerner & Raikhel 1992), the rubber-tree Hevea brasiliensis (van Parijs et al. 1991) or poplar Populus sp. (Clarke et al. 1998). Information is needed on the time taken to establish SAR as well as the production and persistence of SAR-related mRNA and proteins after a single challenging infection. Data from a few annual species are insufficient to evaluate the adaptivity and ecological importance of SAR, or to determine whether plants with different life histories (e.g. annuals compared to long-lived trees) differ in their response. SAR is studied mainly in the context of plant–pathogen interactions, but may also be relevant to mutualistic interactions. Recent papers reported an induction of SAR by non-pathogenic root-colonizing bacteria (Pieterse et al. 1996; Raupach et al. 1996; van Wees et al. 1997), although the establishment of vesicular-arbuscular (VA)-mycorrhizas seems not to induce systemic reactions in host-plants (Vierheilig et al. 1994; Lange et al. 1996). SAR in cucumber and Arabidopsis has also been reported to be induced by compost and compost water extracts, an effect destroyed by autoclaving the compost mix and therefore most probably caused by soil-living micro-organisms (Zhang et al. 1998). This observation in particular leads to the question of whether any plant does exist in nature that has not already been induced by the influence of either abiotic or biotic agents. Mutual symbioses with endophytic fungi that have evolved in several grasses and trees participate in the plants' anti-herbivore defence by providing secondary metabolites, especially neurotoxic alkaloids (Clay 1990). However, little is known about the interactions between the defence mechanisms established during SAR and mutualistic endosymbionts, but it is likely that the considerable indirect cost of SAR will result from its antagonistic effects on mutualistic organisms. Can intra- and interspecific patterns in type, extent and time-course of SAR be accounted for by existing theories of chemical defence in plants, which in most cases are formulated as an anti-herbivore response? In contrast to the human immune system in which specific antibodies are produced as a reaction to each distinct antigen, SAR – once induced by a single pathogen – provides protection against a range of different pathogenic organisms. It is difficult to understand, given the evidence for continuous PR gene expression (Tornero et al. 1997), why a first – and probably severe – infection is required rather than systemic resistance being constitutive. A model proposed by Karban et al. (1997) points out that induced chemical defence may be more effective against herbivores than constitutive resistance. Small amounts of toxin may hardly reduce the herbivore's benefit from feeding on plant tissue, but increasing toxin levels may cause a progressively greater decrease in benefit at higher levels. The authors demonstrated mathematically that, in this case, variable toxin levels will lead to a lower benefit for the herbivore than the continuous presence of the corresponding mean level. Plants differ in their level of constitutive and inducible defence against pathogens (Keen 1992), and the applicability of this model to SAR could therefore be tested by quantifying the effects on the fitness of both plants and pathogens for host-plant species with different levels of inducible defence. Most theories on plant defence, however, assume that there will be a cost to fitness resulting from the production of defence chemicals or structures, which at least must be balanced by the resulting benefit. Inducible defence may thus reduce the overall costs by producing chemicals only when their function is actually required. Ecological costs should ideally be measured as reduction in fitness, i.e. fewer offspring will be produced because of the operation of the trait considered (Simms & Rausher 1987; Marquis 1991; Sagers & Coley 1995). Although, at least in long-lived species, fitness costs are hard to quantify directly (Chapin 1989), several studies have demonstrated that fitness costs may be estimated by measuring reduction in growth rates (Coley 1986; Sagers & Coley 1995; Steinberg 1995 for empirical studies; Skogsmyr & Fagerström 1992 for a theoretical model). Because resources invested in one distinct trait are no longer available for other functions such as reproduction, fitness costs may be estimated in terms of allocation costs, for example by calculating energy and construction costs (Penning de Vries et al. 1974; Gulmon & Mooney 1986; Skogsmyr & Fagerström 1992; Gershenzon 1994; Griffin 1994; Simms & Triplett 1994) or simply by quantifying the allocation of limited resources such as nitrogen (Evans & Black 1993). To my knowledge, only three studies have so far been published that attempt to quantify the costs of resistance against pathogens, and their results do not allow any generalization about the possible costs of SAR. Simms & Triplett (1994) were not able to detect fitness costs of resistance of Ipomoea spp. to anthracnose, nor could Simms & Vision (1995) prove direct allocation costs of localized resistance of young Ipomoea plants. In an attempt to use reduction in germination success to quantify the costs of anti-fungal resistance to different Avena fatua lines, Burdon & Müller (1987) obtained contradictory results from their greenhouse and field studies. However, SAR can be induced chemically in wheat by application of BION® (benzo (1,2,3) thiadiazole-7-thio-carbonic acid S-methyl ester; NOVARTIS, Basel, Switzerland) (Friedrich et al. 1996; Görlach et al. 1996; Lawton et al. 1996), and preliminary results from field studies (M. Heil, personal observations) show that treatment of plants with BION reduced the number of seeds produced. Data from several Macaranga species, which have evolved obligate or facultative mutualisms with ants to protect them continuously and very effectively against herbivory and secondary infections (Fiala et al. 1989, 1994), offer similar hints as to the costs of SAR. Chitinase activities were lower in three Macaranga species than in species from other genera that show no mutualistic interactions with ants. Macaranga plants thus seem to have a remarkably low ability to produce at least one class of PR proteins, and no costs are incurred by the production of compounds that are not required in these plants due to the effective anti-herbivore and anti-fungal defence provided by the ants (Heil et al. 1999). The 'optimal defence' hypothesis (Rhoades 1979) assumes that defence is most important and thus should be most intensive in those parts that are most valuable to the plant, such as young leaves and shoot meristems. In contrast, the 'growth-differentiation balance' hypothesis (Herms & Mattson 1992) assumes a metabolic competition between processes involved in plant growth and 'differentiation' processes necessary for, for example, the synthesis of defence chemicals. This competition should reduce the resources available to defend still growing tissues, and young leaves and shoot meristems should therefore be the least defended parts of a plant. The production of SAR-related proteins instead of proteins that are relevant for growth, the diversion of products of the shikimic acid pathway (Schneider & Ullrich 1994) to synthesize anti-bacterial phenolic compounds rather than aromatic amino acids, and enhanced lignification as reported by Hammerschmidt & Kuc (1982) and Barber et al. (1989), suggest that SAR may incur costs in terms of competition for limited resources. The clear set of physiological data given by Herbers et al. (1996) allows the two theories to be evaluated. The induction of PR protein transcripts in tobacco leaf discs floated on solutions of different sugars depended strongly on leaf developmental stage. Older leaves were highly inducible, while the same concentration of sugars failed to elicit a clear response in leaves that were not yet fully unfolded. It is difficult to use source–sink relationships to explain why only those leaves that produce high amounts of sugars by photosynthesis should be able to use these sugars as signal molecules, but according to the hypothesis of Herms & Mattson (1992) young, still growing, leaves may just be unable to produce PR proteins simply because their whole metabolic apparatus is needed for the biosynthesis of growth-relevant proteins. At least for this example, the 'optimal defence' hypothesis, which would predict high defence levels especially in the young leaves, can be discounted. Further studies using different inductors and comparing their efficacy in dependence on leaf age and developmental stage are needed, however. Unlike SAR, studies on chemical anti-herbivore defence have so far mainly focused on ecological problems and cost–benefit models rather than signalling pathways and resulting gene activities (Hammerschmidt 1993). However, the signalling pathway of SAR, and the octadecanoid pathway (Doares et al. 1995) which is involved in induced resistance against herbivores, may interact. Jasmonic acid, a central signal of the octadecanoid pathway, is produced within a few minutes after insect feeding (Blechert et al. 1995) and leads to an activation of several defence genes (Doares et al. 1995). The application of jasmonic acid also induces the production of PR proteins and therefore resistance against phytopathogens (Cohen et al. 1993; Schweizer et al. 1993). Although salicylic acid can lead to enhanced resistance of cotton to both insects and phytopathogens (Khoshkhoo et al. 1993), Bi et al. (1997) failed to identify SA as a signal in the anti-herbivore defence of this species, and Korth & Dixon (1997) also demonstrated that pathways leading to anti-herbivore defence are not activated by abiotic damage. In this case, an ecological point of view can again provide a framework for understanding the physiological findings. In nature, herbivore attack or mechanical wounding often leads to secondary pathogen attack, and using primary wounding as a signal for the induction of SAR enables the plant to be prepared for probable secondary pathogen attacks. On the other hand, herbivores seldom use heavily infected plant parts as a food source, and induction of anti-herbivore defence by signals derived from pathogen attack would therefore probably lead to the synthesis of superfluous defence molecules. Progress in ecology essentially needs testable theories as well as pluralism and diversity in new approaches (Weiner 1995). The application of specialized theories to a broader spectrum of findings often paves the way for rapid scientific developments, and the combination of formerly separated scientific disciplines can also result in new insights. Integration of SAR into ecological field research should thus provide the possibility for successful further research. I wish to thank my supervisor, K.E. Linsenmair, University of Würzburg, for allowing the time necessary to spend on the literature search and on conducting the field studies on SAR. Many thanks also to K.E. Linsenmair, B. Fiala, W.

https://doi.org/10.1093/ismeco/ycae148,Distinct phytoplankton size classes respond differently to biotic and abiotic factors,"Abstract The interplay between abiotic (resource supply, temperature) and biotic (grazing) factors determines growth and loss processes in phytoplankton through resource competition and trophic interactions, which are mediated by morphological traits like size. Here, we study the relative importance of grazers, water physics, and chemistry on the daily net accumulation rates (ARs) of individual phytoplankton from natural communities, grouped into six size classes from circa 10 to 500 μm. Using a Random Forest modelling approach and 4 years of daily data from a lake, we find that water temperature is generally a pivotal control of all phytoplankton ARs. At the same time, nutrients and light are important for the smallest and the largest classes. Mesozooplankton abundance is a key predictor of the AR for small phytoplankton, with microzooplankton being important for the middle-size range. In our data, large and small phytoplankton have different (seasonal) blooming patterns: small forms are favoured by low temperature and grazing, and high phosphorus levels. Larger forms show positive ARs at high temperatures and low phosphorus (being relatively insensitive to zooplankton grazing). These results help us understand the opportunities and limitations of using size to explain and model phytoplankton responses to biotic and abiotic environmental change.",https://openalex.org/W4407269118,5962b975451e1735bb1d7225f46dcc399c118301,0,True,0.9684449434280396,0
https://doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2019-0067,"Growth, developmental, and size structure responses in tadpole prey under increasing threat from gape-limited newts","Size variability within a cohort can have profound effects on community ecology and evolution. Although competition for resources generally increases size variability, the effect of (non-consumptive) predation on this demographic trait remains relatively poorly understood. Existing models suggest a positive correlation between growth rate (mediated by resource level) and expression of size variability (as measured by the coefficient of variation) in prey cohorts. We tested this prediction by exposing the tadpoles of the Japanese Forest Green Treefrog (Rhacophorus arboreus (Okada and Kawano, 1924) = Zhangixalus arboreus (Okada and Kawano, 1924)) to the non-lethal presence of gape-limited Japanese Fire-bellied Newts (Cynops pyrrhogaster (Boie, 1826)) at low and high predator densities in an outdoor mesocosm experiment. Tadpole growth rates and periphyton biomass increased with newt density. But in contrast to prediction, elevated growth rates did not increase but, reversely, decreased cohort size variability in the tadpoles. We discuss two potential mechanisms behind this outcome. First, increased resource availability mediated by predator feeding may have reduced the strength of competition, ultimately leading to more evenly distributed resource gains among individuals; second, if smaller individuals grew relatively faster than larger individuals, as to quicken entry to a size refuge against the gape-limited predator, then inter-individual size differences could diminish over time.",https://openalex.org/W2980131246,b2b634684c7e21170ec9cccfa927703ae121a2ae,0,True,0.9934020638465881,0
https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1461-9563.2001.00083.x,"Out of sight, out of mind: the impacts of root‐feeding insects in natural and managed systems","Data from diverse ecosystems indicate that more than 50% of net primary production is commonly allocated to below-ground plant parts (Coleman, 1976), and values for particular plant species approach 90% (Andersen, 1987). Root biomass can typically vary from under 300 g/m2 to over 4000 g/m2 of soil surface (Rickleffs, 1973) and, however, you look at it, that's a lot of biomass. Although the nutritional value of root tissue is generally lower than that of foliar tissue, we shouldn't be surprised that many species of herbivore, including insects, exploit the roots of plants. What is surprising, however, is the extreme paucity of information on the distribution, abundance and effects of root-feeding insects on plants in natural and managed systems. If we as entomologists were to use our peer-reviewed literature as an indication of the relative allocation by plants to foliage and roots, we would get a shockingly biased picture. Over the last 5 years, for example, Ecological Entomology (5 years) and Agricultural and Forest Entomology (1 year) have published a combined four articles on root-feeding insects in comparison to 288 articles on insects that feed on above-ground plant parts. With this apparent bias in effort, it's little wonder that even basic information on the distribution and abundance of root-feeding insects is missing for most ecosystems (Morón-Ríos et al. 1997). Yet below-ground insect herbivores are known to influence the diversity of plant communities, the rate and direction of succession, competitive interactions among plants, their allocation to different functions, the susceptibility of plants to other herbivores and pathogens and, ultimately, the yield of agricultural and forest systems (below). This paper considers what we do know about the effects of root-feeding insects on plants, and where our major knowledge gaps remain. Its intent is to stimulate discussion and an increase in research efforts on the ecology and management of below-ground insect herbivores. For purposes of brevity, 'root-feeding' is used here as shorthand for consumption of all below-ground tissues, including roots, rhizomes and other storage organs. Removal of root tissue by insect herbivores can result in a diversity of responses in their host plants, varying from changes in root : shoot ratios, through changes in subsequent carbon and nitrogen allocation, to death of the plants. Of course, the effects of root herbivory on plants are not restricted to loss of root tissue. In mixed-grass prairie, for example, root-feeding can reduce annual net primary productivity by 16 times more than is actually consumed (Ingham & Detling, 1990). In both agricultural (Latin & Reed, 1985) and forest (Klepzig et al. 1996) systems, root-feeding insects can introduce plant pathogens that affect survival and yield. There is no clear consensus as to whether loss of biomass from root or shoot tissue has the greatest deleterious effects on plant performance but, in at least one study, removal of root tissue had a greater effect on plant performance than did removal of shoot tissue (Reichman & Smith, 1991). Root herbivores may cause losses in protein from the tap root, a reduction in non-structural carbohydrate root reserves and, subsequently, plant mortality (Godfrey et al. 1987; Dintenfass & Brown, 1988a,1b). However, plants infested by root-feeding insects may also exhibit increases in root nitrogen content and a concomitant reduction in foliar N content, reflecting a redirection of nitrogen to the stronger sink (Steinger & Müller-Schärer, 1992). It would seem important that future studies direct attention to whether differences in experimental results (i.e. increases or decreases in root nitrogen content) reflect differences in the plants under study, the identity of the root herbivores, or other ecological variables. This is the kind of basic information that is still lacking. It seems likely, however, that lumping all root-feeding insects together into a single functional group and expecting them to have similar effects on their host plants may be a considerable oversimplification. In the same way that plants respond differentially to attack by different species or guilds of insect herbivores above ground (Hunter, 2000a) so we should expect differential effects of below-ground herbivores on plant performance. This was aptly demonstrated by Steinger & Müller-Schärer, (1992), who found that root-feeding by the moth Agapeta zoegana on Centaurea maculosa seedlings had no effect on shoot or root mass. By contrast, feeding by the weevil Cyphocleomus achates on the same plant greatly reduced shoot biomass. At least some plants can tolerate significant levels of root herbivory, even under water stress (Dunn & Frommelt, 1998), with compensatory growth replacing root biomass (Schmid et al. 1990). In legumes, there can be compensation for nodule damage by insect herbivores (Quinn & Hall, 1992), although the compensatory mechanisms may be insufficient to prevent reductions in the nitrogen concentrations of tissue. In the legume Medicago sativa, compensatory responses are strong and denodulated plants recover nodule number and nodule biomass within 15 and 22 days, respectively (Quinn & Hall, 1996). Indeed, many plants appear to be adept at re-growing lost root tissue and, as a side note, this may lead us to underestimate the impacts of below-ground herbivores. However, compensation for root loss is not without cost and compensatory root growth in response to below-ground herbivory may often occur at the expense of above-ground net primary production (Andersen, 1987). Losses in above-ground biomass appear to be a common response to root damage by insects. For example, root herbivory on white clover by Sitona flavescens reduces foliar biomass, total nitrogen and carbon contents, and impairs nitrogen fixation (Murray et al. 1996). Likewise, feeding by Cerotoma arcuata larvae on bean roots and nodules reduces plant growth and subsequent yield (Teixeira et al. 1996). As Goldson et al. (1988) point out, compensation is associated with increased respiration rates and depleted carbohydrate reserves within the plant as assimilates from shoot reserves are diverted to satisfy the increased demands of the root system. Moreover, even when vegetative recovery seems to be high, compensation for root damage does not necessarily mean that subsequent reproductive output, competitive ability and nutrient or water uptake will be as high as those of undamaged plants (Detling et al. 1980). At least some of the deleterious effects on plants of root damage are likely to be expressed indirectly through interactions with other organisms and the environment (see below). Given that compensatory root growth may lead us to underestimate the densities and activities of root-feeding insects, we may be most likely to recognize their effects post mortem. For example, root-feeding insects are associated with pine seedling mortality in the south-eastern United States (Mitchell et al. 1991) and Eucalyptus seedling mortality in plantations in India (Nair & Varma, 1985). In a spectacular example, ghost moth caterpillars can cause up to 41% mortality in bush lupine stands in California (Strong et al. 1995) and appear to contribute to the long-term dynamics of lupine populations. However, entomopathogenic nematodes can greatly reduce populations of ghost moth caterpillars and the ultimate effect of root-feeding on bush lupine populations probably reflects complex interactions among many ecological players (Strong et al. 1996, 1999). Interestingly, the fecundity of bush lupines can take 3 years to respond to suppression of below-ground herbivory (Maron, 1998), suggesting that short-term experiments may again underestimate the impact of root-feeding insects on plant populations. Unless root-feeding insects cause substantial crop mortality, or directly attack plant parts that are harvested for economic gain, their impacts on financial yield can be difficult to assess. Nonetheless, some root-feeding insects have been shown to have dramatic effects upon production systems. During the 1990s, black pine weevil, Otiorhynchus sulcatus, progressively became the most serious pest in European ornamental nursery stock and soft fruit production (Labuschagne, 1999). Larvae feed on both roots and crown and the devastating nature of the pest means that the threshold for control may be very low. Its pest status is exacerbated by life-history traits that include a wide range of alternative hosts (weeds and non-crop plants) and a fecundity of between 500 and 1200 eggs per female per season. Like many root-feeding pests, O. sulcatus is difficult to detect during the early stages of outbreak and its densities are hard to monitor. They are also difficult to detect before or during the transportation of soil or nursery stock. Nodule-feeding insects that attack nitrogen-fixing legumes can also be serious pests. Although well-recognized as pests of pulse crops such as peas and beans (O'Keefe et al. 1984), they can also cause economic problems in other production systems. For example, low input grassland systems managed for grazing usually require nitrogen-fixing legumes such as clover (Murray & Clements, 1999) that are useful both as a nitrogen source for the soil and as forage for livestock. Many agricultural soils are also enriched by the planting of legumes as 'green manure' (P. F. Hendrix, personal communication). Weevils in the genus Sitona seem to be particularly important pests in such systems as a consequence of nodule feeding by young larvae and root-feeding by older larvae. In fact, Sitona lineatus, distributed throughout Europe and in the western United States, is responsible for serious losses in yield to both edible legumes and forage legumes (Jackson, 1920; Oschmann, 1984). Again, estimates of yield losses may often be underestimated because of the difficulties associated with measuring damage by larvae. In addition to such well-known pests as corn rootworm and cabbage root fly, root-feeding insects influence many other production systems. These include the turf grass industry, where both yield and aesthetic quality affect economic value (Crutchfield & Potter, 1995), and apple, orchards where root-feeding aphids can reduce tree growth and the number and weight of fruit per tree (Brown et al. 1995). Given the ability of some below-ground herbivores to depress plant growth and reproduction, it is not surprising that they are often evaluated as potential biological control agents of weed pests (Müller-Schärer, 1991; Blossey, 1993; Sheppard et al. 1995; Harris & Clapperton, 1997; Schwarzlaender, 1997). In a well-studied example, control of Senecio jacobaea in California has been maintained over the long-term by the combined activities of a defoliating moth and a root-feeding flea beetle (Pemberton & Turner, 1990). Control of root-feeding insects in production systems is hampered, in part, by the difficulties of detection and access. Simply put, it is difficult to know when intervention is required and even more difficult to target a substantial proportion of the pest population with the chosen method of control. Some measure of success against the black pine weevil has been achieved using glue-coated barriers and trap cropping with favoured plant species (Labuschagne, 1999). Biological control of this and other root pests using entomopathogenic nematodes may provide the most promise (Kakouli et al. 1997), given that they may be specific to the pest and can be applied through a variety of measures including irrigation systems. Entomopathogenic nematodes also appear to be important mortality agents in some natural systems (Strong et al. 1996, 1999), suggesting that their life-histories are well-suited for exploitation as agents of control. The jury is still out on the effectiveness of general predators as biological control agents of root-feeding insects. Carabid ground beetles would appear to have significant potential as control agents, but their reported impact on pests such as the cabbage root fly (Hughes, 1959; Coaker & Williams, 1963) may have been overestimated (Finch & Elliot, 1999). Recent studies have indicated that the efficacy of beetle predators is directly related to the relative size of beetle and prey (Finch, 1996), which may aid in the selection of potential control agents. As studies by Finch & Elliott, (1999) make clear, beetle predators are much more effective when the life stages of the pest are directly accessible on the soil surface, and even thin layers of soil covering the prey items can prevent the successful suppression of prey populations. Of course, selection of appropriate generalist predators for biological control is predicated upon knowing what they consume and in what proportion. Prey-specific monoclonal antibodies appear to have considerable potential as indicators of diet breadth in generalists such as carabids (Harwood et al. 1999; Symondson & Glen, 1999). Once again, however, we are limited by a basic lack of knowledge of both pest and predator ecology. Chemical control of root-feeding insects has been the most common intervention strategy. However, there are concerns with the safety of commonly used products such as Chlorpyrifos (Dursban), which provides only a few weeks of control in its standard formulation. The extended release formulation of Chlorpyrifos (suScon Green) lasts longer in the environment, but is more expensive and less likely to come into contact with individual root pests. Both formulations can kill natural enemies and other soil fauna. Given that Bt-transgenic corn can release biologically active Bt into the rhizosphere in root exudates (Saxena et al. 1999), there exists the potential to develop transgenic crops modified specifically to defend themselves against root-feeding insects. Of course, the continuing controversy surrounding the development and use of genetically modified crops (Hunter, 2000b) may limit the exploitation of transgenic plants for use against root-feeding insects. Such crops would, however, solve the problem of access by ensuring contact between pest populations and the mechanism of control. Cultural control methods also have potential to reduce economic losses imposed by below-ground insect herbivores (Potter et al. 1996). For example, seasonal draining of rice fields can reduce oviposition by rice water weevil (Hesler et al. 1992). Likewise, traditional plant breeding programmes may be able to select for crops that are either tolerant or resistant to damage by root-feeding insects. In one of the few studies to address the issue, Houle & Simard 1996) found that compensatory responses (tolerance) of willow plants to simulated root herbivory did not vary among willow genotypes. The apparent lack of genetic variation in tolerance to root herbivory requires further investigation, given that genetic variation for resistance has been observed in several other systems (Powell et al. 1983; Byers et al. 1996; Strong et al. 1996). Indeed, the entire issue of genetically based resistance and tolerance to below-ground herbivores requires much more exploration in combination with mechanistic studies of root defence. One of the most striking gaps in our understanding of below-ground herbivory is the degree to which below-ground structures (roots, rhizomes, etc.) gain protection from herbivory through chemical defence. There is little doubt that some below-ground plant organs contain high concentrations of toxins (e.g. the potent alkaloids in the rhizomes of bloodroot, Sanguinaria canadensis). However, the standard bioassays and measurements of insect performance, so prevalent in studies of above-ground insect herbivory, are generally lacking in below-ground systems. For example, although the presence of phenylpropanoid-derived metabolites in some plant roots is well established (Graham, 1991), their effects on insect herbivores have received little attention. Likewise, fine roots of forest trees often contain astringent phenolics and their concentrations generally increase as soil fertility declines (Muller et al. 1989). However, the degree to which astringent phenolics deter root-feeding insects is presently unclear. Studies of defence induction in roots are also in their infancy. Although both synthesis and concentrations of some plant defences are known to be high in roots (Baldwin, 1989; Tallamy & McCloud, 1991), comparatively little work has examined the effects of induced defences in roots on root-feeding insects. The few studies to date suggest that, as in above-ground tissues, defence induction in roots may be a common phenomenon. Grape (Vitis vinifera) roots can respond to attack by Phylloxera vastatrix aphids by producing a local necrotic zone around each aphid that isolates attackers from healthy tissue (Karban & Baldwin, 1997). Roots of wild parsnip, Pastinaca sativa, respond to damage by increases in their concentrations of furanocoumarins (Zangerl & Rutledge, 1996). In a compelling example, damage to spinach roots induces phytoecdysteroids (analogues of insect moulting hormones), whereas infection by fungal pathogens does not (Schmelz et al. 1998, 1999). Given that foliar concentrations of phytoecdysteroids are unaffected by root damage, this provides evidence of an evolved defence in spinach roots directed at below-ground insect herbivores. However, the effects of insect herbivores on the induction of defences in roots may be complex. For example, damage by turnip root fly, Delia floralis, causes a linear increase in only one of 14 glucosinolates in swede roots. An apparent balance between increases in aromatic glucosinolates and decreases in aliphatic glucosinolates results in overall glucosinolate concentration being unaffected by root damage (Hopkins et al. 1998). There are, of course, methodological difficulties associated with assessing putative chemical defences and their effects on insect herbivores below ground. In vitro root culture techniques may prove useful in future studies of root defence against herbivores (Wu et al. 1999). It would be naïve to expect that interactions between root-feeding insects and their host plants occur in isolation from other species in the community or are unaffected by interactions with the abiotic environment. Below-ground insect herbivores are members of complex food webs and participate in both community-level and ecosystem-level processes. Consequently, both biotic and abiotic forces interact with below-ground herbivory to dictate plant performance (Godfrey & Yeargan, 1985). For example, the effects of root-feeding on Vicia establishment vary with both soil fertility and levels of mycorrhizal infection (Ganade & Brown, 1997). Likewise, compensation by Centaurea maculosa for weevil herbivory on its roots is greatly compromised by nutrient deficiency (Steinger & Müller-Schärer (1992). In a fascinating multi-trophic interaction, fungal endophytes (Acremonium spp.) associated with fescue grasses increase the susceptibility of root-feeding Japanese beetle larvae to the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (Grewal et al. 1995). Competition among plants can overwhelm the effect of root herbivory in some systems (Müller-Schärer, 1991), but not in others (Noetzold et al. 1997). It seems likely then that interactions among root feeding and other ecological factors will prove to be complex and context-dependent in many systems. Studies by Val Brown and colleagues have been instrumental in highlighting the effects of below-ground herbivores on plant diversity. At the community level, insect herbivory below ground can reduce plant species richness and alter patterns of succession in European old fields (Brown & Gange, 1989). Specifically, root-feeding insects can accelerate succession by reducing forb persistence and colonization (Brown & Gange, 1992) with the application of soil insecticide increasing plant species richness, vegetative cover and plant size (Masters & Brown, 1997). In short-grass prairie, even infrequent outbreaks of insect herbivores below ground can have long-term effects on plant community dynamics and recovery from disturbance (Coffin et al. 1998). Of course, the effects of below-ground herbivory on plant biomass and species diversity can vary both seasonally and with the plant species under investigation (Wardle & Barker, 1997). At the ecosystem level, low levels of below-ground herbivory can increase nitrogen flux from plants to soil, increase soil microbial activity, and increase the rates of nitrogen recycling in grassland ecosystems (Bardgett et al. 1999). In tallgrass prairie, the emergence of annual cicadas can represent a significant flux of non-gaseous nitrogen from below-to above-ground (Callaham et al. 2000). Mycorrhizae, as a result of their intimate associations with root systems, may influence feeding by below-ground herbivores by changing the quality or the quantity of root resources (Gange, 1999). If studies of root–insect herbivore interactions are relatively rare, those that consider mycorrhizae are positively endangered! The data that do exist suggest that colonization of plant roots by arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) has a negative impact on root-feeding insects. For example, Gange et al. (1994) demonstrated that the survival and biomass of black pine weevil larvae feeding on the roots of Taraxacum officinale were halved by the presence of the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae. When Gange (1996) repeated the experiment using strawberry as a host-plant, root colonization by a single species of AM again reduced the performance of weevil larvae. However, when roots were colonized by two AM species simultaneously, the negative effects on the root-feeding insect disappeared. Extrapolating from a single study is dangerous, but it suggests that any resistance factor(s) conferred on roots by their association with mycorrhizae may be compromised if multiple infection takes place. Given that mycorrhizal colonization generally increases the biomass of roots (Smith & Read, 1997), their putative effects upon root resistance to herbivores is more likely to be mediated by changes in root quality than root quantity (Gange, 1999). As studies of below-ground herbivory become more common, complex interactions among community members both above- and below-ground are likely to emerge. For example, foliage removal by a leaf-chewing insects can result in reduced mycorrhizal colonization of plant roots (Gehring & Whitham, 1991; Gange & Bower, 1997). Given that mycorrhizal colonization can confer resistance to root feeders (Gange et al. 1994; Gange, 1996), above-ground defoliation has the potential to increase the susceptibility of roots to their herbivores. However, most studies seem to suggest that the opposite is true; stem- and leaf-feeding insects appear to reduce the performance of root-feeding insects. For example, Moran & Whitham, (1990) demonstrated that leaf galling by aphids on Chenopodium can lead to a large reduction in the populations of root-feeding aphids. Conversely, below-ground damage by insect herbivores is generally thought to increase the quality of plant tissues for above-ground herbivores (Gange & Brown, 1989; Masters et al. 1993). These complex interactions between below- and above-ground herbivores are potentially very important. When we observe high densities of insect herbivores feeding upon the leaves and shoots of our agricultural and timber crops, we rarely consider the possibility that the severity of their depredations may result, in part, from high densities of root-feeding insects. Likewise, yield increases following the successful control of above-ground insect pests may be compromised by subsequent increases in the densities of root-feeding herbivores. It may be early to speak of generalities when so few data are available, but the current consensus appears to be that the patterns described by Moran & Whitham, (1990) and Gange & Brown, (1989) may be common; above-ground herbivory has a negative effect on root-feeders, whereas below-ground herbivory has a positive effect on foliar feeders (Masters et al. 1993; Masters, 1999). The evidence for such contramensal interactions (Arthur & Mitchell, 1989) comes from both laboratory and field studies. For example, root-feeding aphid populations on Cardamine are significantly reduced in the presence of shoot-feeding aphids (Salt et al. 1996). Similarly, the growth rates of chafer larvae feeding upon the roots of Sonchus oleraceus are reduced when leaves are concurrently mined by Agromyzid larvae (Masters & Brown, 1992). By contrast, the pupal weights of leaf miners are higher in the presence of chafers. Other guilds of above-ground herbivores (leaf-chewers, phloem-feeders) also respond positively to chafer damage in this system (Masters, 1999) while simultaneously depressing chafer growth rates. Field experiments employing soil insecticides (Masters, 1995b; Masters & Brown, 1997) and artificial root damage (Foggo & Speight, 1993; Foggo et al. 1994) support the view that below-ground herbivores facilitate population growth of insect herbivores above ground. Interactions between above- and below-ground herbivores appear to be mediated primarily by increases in soluble nitrogen and sugar contents in above-ground tissues (root-feeders increase foliage quality) and decreases in root biomass below-ground (aerial herbivores depress root growth) (Holland & Detling, 1990; Masters, 1995a). More detailed investigations of mechanism are, however, desperately needed in such systems, including the potential induction or suppression of defences (Seastedt et al. 1988; Karban & Baldwin, 1997) and the signalling pathways responsible for both defensive and 'civilian' plant responses to damage (Hunter, 2000a). Such investigations may help to explain why some studies do not conform to established patterns. For example, above-ground grazing by vertebrates can increase the densities of root-feeding insects (Roberts & Morton, 1985; Seastedt et al. 1988), and artificial defoliation of bunchgrass, Muhlenbergia quadridentata, has no effect on root-feeding Phyllophaga larvae in Mexico (Morón-Ríos et al. 1997). Given the importance of damage-specific signal cascades to the defensive response of plants (Hunter, 2000a), we should not be surprised that vertebrate grazing, artificial damage and foliar-feeding insects generate different responses by plants and their below-ground herbivores. In terms of relative biomass and productivity, below-ground plant parts represent a substantial fraction of the resources available to terrestrial herbivores. In terms of relative effort by insect ecologists, root-feeding insects have been greatly understudied. There are several areas of endeavour that would appear to require considerable work. First, we need detailed mechanistic studies of root defences. How variable are the physical and chemical defences of roots? Do they have a significant impact upon the populations of root-feeding insects? What signalling pathways are expressed during the induction of root defences and how are they affected by environmental variables? Second, we need to explore genetic variation in the tolerance and resistance of plant roots to their insect herbivores. An understanding of that genetic variation, and the role of the environment in its expression, will allow us to better comprehend the evolution of root defences and the potential to select for resistant and tolerant crop varieties. Third, we should explore the potential of genetically modified crops with tissue-specific root defences against root-feeding insects. Problems of applying control measures below ground may make transgenic plants a suitable option for reducing the depredations of below-ground crop pests. Of course, a detailed understanding of rhizosphere ecology and impacts on non-target organisms will also be required. Fourth, increased exploitation of entomopathogenic nematodes as control agents of root-feeding insects should be explored. They appear to have dramatic impacts in both natural and managed systems and are of great potential benefit to biological control programmes. Finally, studies of root herbivore–mycorrhizal interactions are considerably improving our understanding of soil ecology and their number should be greatly increased. Insect ecologists are not generally reluctant to get their hands dirty, and the paucity of studies of below-ground herbivores may reflect methodological difficulties rather than lack of interest. It might be time for the funding agencies to develop financial incentives to encourage researchers to solve methodological limitations and to redress the imbalance that currently favours research on insects above ground. In any case, we have clearly had our heads in the sand on the issue of root-feeding insects. Unfortunately, most of us appear to have had our eyes shut at the time. I would like to thank the US Department of Agriculture (Grant 00-35101-9283) for supporting our work on root herbivores.",https://openalex.org/W1971573803,8b3d2797140207bab00cf025a5120780c9564dd2,0,True,0.9469349980354309,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4950,Competition between mixo‐ and heterotrophic ciliates under dynamic resource supply,"Abstract The outcome of species competition strongly depends on the traits of the competitors and associated trade‐offs, as well as on environmental variability. Here, we investigate the relevance of consumer trait variation for species coexistence in a ciliate consumer–microalgal prey system under fluctuating regimes of resource supply. We focus on consumer competition and feeding traits, and specifically on the consumer's ability to overcome periods of resource limitation by mixotrophy, that is, the ability of photosynthetic carbon fixation via algal symbionts in addition to phagotrophy. In a 48‐day chemostat experiment, we investigated competitive interactions of different heterotrophic and mixotrophic ciliates of the genera Euplotes and Coleps under different resource regimes, providing prey either continuously or in pulses under constant or fluctuating light, entailing periods of resource depletion in fluctuating environments, but overall providing the same amount of prey and light. Although ultimate competition results remained unaffected, population dynamics of mixotrophic and heterotrophic ciliates were significantly altered by resource supply mode. However, the effects differed among species combinations and changed over time. Whether mixotrophs or heterotrophs dominated in competition strongly depended on the genera of the competing species and thus, species‐specific differences in the minimum resource requirements that are associated with feeding on shared prey, nutrient uptake, light harvesting, and access to additional resources such as bacteria. Potential differences in the curvature of the species' resource‐dependent growth functions may have further mediated the species‐specific responses to the different resource supply modes. Overall, our study demonstrates that genus‐ or species‐specific traits other than that related to nutritional mode may override the relevance of acquired phototrophy by heterotrophs in competitive interactions, and that the potential advantage of photosynthetic carbon fixation of symbiont‐bearing mixotrophs in competition with pure heterotrophs may differ greatly among different mixotrophs, playing out under different environmental conditions and depending on the specific requirements of the species. Complex trophic interactions determine the outcome of competition, which can only be understood by taking on a multidimensional trait perspective.",https://openalex.org/W4400672496,283cf8989c67d0c0c4e81a1f19e954fe939f24af,0,True,0.9901108145713806,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.14122,Resource supply and organismal dominance are associated with high secondary production in temperate agricultural streams,"Abstract Agricultural land‐use affects the environmental and biological characteristics of stream ecosystems through multiple pathways including nutrient and pesticide contamination, riparian clear‐cutting and hydromorphological degradation. These changes in the abiotic environment can have a direct effect on the productivity of macroinvertebrate communities through environmental filtering and via altered resource conditions encompassing a shift from allochthonous to autochthonous primary production and changes in elemental stoichiometry and food quality. Additionally, macroinvertebrate productivity can be affected indirectly via biological mechanisms, such as changes in species interactions, richness, competition, and predation. We studied the effects of agriculture on structural and functional descriptors of macroinvertebrate communities by assessing environmental characteristics and macroinvertebrate secondary production (MSP), biomass and density in two forested and two agricultural streams and investigated underlying biotic mechanisms. On average, MSP was 1.6–3.6, biomass 2.8–6.2 and density 5–13 times higher in agricultural than in forested streams. This pattern was associated with higher nutrient concentrations, standing crops of riparian herbaceous vegetation, suspended particulate organic carbon, quantity and quality of epilithic biofilms and chlorophyll‐a concentrations in seston and biofilm of the agricultural streams. Species richness and evenness were significantly lower in agricultural than in forested streams. A negative relationship between MSP and species richness and evenness indicated that density compensation and trait dominance were the prevalent mechanisms facilitating higher MSP in agricultural streams. Our findings suggest that the loss of riparian canopy and excess nutrient conditions are the major environmental drivers contributing to homogenization of ecological niches and dominance of highly productive non‐insect generalist species. This study highlights the importance of an ecosystem approach to understanding how complex aggregate stressors affect the regulation of consumer–resource interactions. There is an urgent need to preserve or restore natural riparian vegetation, fostering habitat and resource diversity and limiting nutrient contamination to stream ecosystems.

Understanding the role of species as drivers of ecosystem processes is imperative to preserve, utilize, and sustain ecosystems globally. Addition of species through invasion and loss of species through extirpation or extinction can have profound effects on ecosystem structure and function (Zavaleta et al. 2009). This is especially true for freshwater ecosystems in which a preponderance of native species are threatened with extinction and where nonnative species are frequently introduced (Dudgeon and Smith 2006). Commonly, anthropogenic activities result in the loss of biodiversity and enhance the ability of exotic species to invade and persist in novel habitats (Dudgeon and Smith 2006). Because these activities are expected to increase through time, advances in understanding the consequences of species loss and addition on ecosystem function are needed to guide appropriate management and conservation decisions. The loss and addition of organisms may render habitats functionally impaired (Covich et al. 2004); therefore, understanding the consequences of such change is imperative to manage, mitigate, and restore freshwater ecosystems. We organized this oral session to examine experimental and theoretical work from studies of the addition of species and the loss of species from freshwater ecosystems. The overarching goal of this session was to begin designing a framework to quantify the effect of organisms on ecosystem processes among species and across systems. As a whole, the speakers addressed the following questions in a broad range of freshwater ecosystems: 1. What patterns emerge from studies examining changes in ecosystem function after species invasion and species loss? 2. Are these patterns consistent across study sites and study organisms? 3. Are there specific traits that make a species more apt to be an important driver of ecosystem function? The session focused on the effects of aquatic organisms on community structure and trophic relationships, primary productivity, organic matter processing, and nutrient dynamics. Several presentations highlighted the context-dependent nature of ecosystem change in response to species addition or loss in the face of anthropogenic pressures such as drought and eutrophication. During the session we also discussed how species-specific traits can be incorporated into unifying ways to understand and predict the effects of species gain and species loss on ecosystem processes among species and across freshwater ecosystems. The loss or invasion of a species in one habitat can change fluxes of materials and organisms within habitats and to adjacent or distant habitats, with consequences for food webs and ecosystem processes (Baxter et al. 2005, Mineau et al. 2012). Kate Boersma and colleagues documented decreased trophic trait diversity, specifically, the disappearance of top predators, in arid river systems in response to habitat fragmentation. She used experimental manipulations to test the effects of a top predator, Abedus herberti (Hemiptera: Belostomatidae), removal on community structure and basal food resources. In her experiment, the removal of Abedus instigated a trophic cascade and reduced algal fluorescence, likely caused by the release of the algae-grazing mayfly Callibaetis from Abedus predation. Top predator removal also changed the detritivore community by significantly reducing the abundance of the dominant consumer of coarse particulate organic matter, the caddisfly Phylloicus. Boersma's results documented that species loss alters biotic relationships and can be a strong driver of ecosystem change. In his presentation, Colden Baxter and colleagues summarized changes in between-habitat fluxes of materials and organisms using data collected from invading fish species on two continents. In Japan, he showed that invading rainbow trout triggered changes in feeding behavior of native char, which subsequently decreased aquatic insect emergence and riparian spider abundance (Baxter et al. 2004). Similarly, in western U.S. streams, Baxter and his coauthors addressed the question, “Is a trout a trout”? They demonstrated that invading brook trout, characterized by higher productivity and different trophic traits than native cutthroat trout, reduced the flux of emerging insects and riparian spider abundance relative to the native species. Baxter and others provided evidence that strong cross-habitat effects of species additions or losses can be caused by species with novel functional traits, trophic mismatches between invaders and native food webs, and relatively subtle differences in behavior of invasive species vs. the natives they replace. Native and introduced organisms can affect net ecosystem production through both direct and indirect pathways, potentially giving rise to interesting feedbacks between primary and secondary production (McIntyre et al. 2006) and decomposition (Rugenski et al. 2012). Work by Peter McIntyre and colleagues in Lake Tanganyika, East Africa, documented the effects of fishes in a species-rich system characterized by low ambient nutrients and high primary productivity. He used a coupled observational and experimental approach to understand how native grazing fish density and diversity influenced benthic algal productivity directly via consumption and indirectly via nutrient recycling. Grazers often suppress primary productivity by reducing algal biomass, though they can also stimulate new growth and select for vigorous algae (McIntyre et al. 2006). When nutrients are scarce, primary productivity can also be enhanced when grazers or higher-level consumers are recycling nutrients in readily available forms (McIntyre et al. 2006). McIntyre and his coauthors demonstrated that grazer density had strong positive effects on algal metabolism by mediating nutrient availability, and these effects exceeded direct negative effects of grazing on algal productivity. Overall, they documented how shifts in both community composition and fish density can affect ecosystem productivity, with a strong potential for positive feedbacks of grazing fishes. McIntyre and others concluded the gain or loss of grazing species from freshwater systems can have profound repercussions for productivity, and if positive effects predominate, then there is the potential for positive feedbacks between primary and secondary productivity that could give rise to highly productive systems despite nutrient scarcity. Two talks highlighted changes in organic matter processing rates after species addition or loss from aquatic ecosystems. Initially, Colden Baxter and colleagues described how the invasion of western U.S. riparian areas by Russian olive has altered stream organic matter budgets and nutrient dynamics. They suggested these changes were due to the ability of the invader to fix nitrogen, and because Russian olive produces low-quality leaf litter which decomposes slowly and is underutilized by native stream animals (Mineau et al. 2012). Conversely, Weston Nowlin and colleagues documented increased leaf litter decomposition rates in the presence of an invasive armored catfish, Hypostomus, in Texas rivers. Increased leaf litter decomposition rates were likely a result of increased mechanical disturbance of litter by Hypostomus during their movements and foraging activities. In both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, organisms directly affect nutrient storage and cycling by sequestering nutrients through growth and remineralizing nutrients via excretion and egestion (Vanni 2002). Although many studies have documented the effects of organisms on nutrient dynamics, there has not been a synthesis examining the effects of species losses and additions across systems. To understand the potential effects of the addition or loss of species on nutrient dynamics, many of the talks featured in the session summarized the influence of organisms on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) storage and cycling after species were added to or removed from freshwater ecosystems. Holistically, the presentations addressed a variety of species in diverse ecosystems. For example, presentations by Carla Atkinson and Amanda Rugenski and their collaborators highlighted the important functional role aquatic organisms can play in nutrient dynamics using three case studies: two assemblages of native species (freshwater mussels in Oklahoma and tadpoles in Panama) threatened with local extinction, and an invasive species (armored catfish in Mexico). Collectively, these case studies indicated the roles of animals in nutrient dynamics are species-specific, context-dependent, and biomass or density-dependent. For example, areal excretion and nutrient storage rates for native mussels was substantial among nine sample sites in Oklahoma. Among-site variation in this system was due to differences in densities and species composition of mussel communities. Similarly, in the Chacamax River in southern Mexico, introduced armored catfish attain an areal biomass that is two orders of magnitude greater than native fishes, thereby dominating the fluxes of nutrients through remineralization and the pools of nutrients stored in body tissues. Conversely, the substantial influence on nutrient cycling and storage by native tadpoles in Panama was primarily density-dependent. Coupled with the effects of urbanization, eutrophication, and water extraction, the effects of species addition and species loss on ecosystem function can be magnified (Covich et al. 2004, Zavaleta et al. 2009). Climate change and water withdrawals in arid regions are causing once-perennial streams to fragment or dry completely (Jackson et al. 2001). Several talks highlighted the potential and realized threat that water extraction will play on the loss of organisms from freshwater habitats and the subsequent changes in ecosystem function. For example, Caryn Vaughn quantified the influence of drought and water extraction on the functional roles of freshwater mussels in Oklahoma rivers. Freshwater mussels are large, long-lived suspension feeders that provide important ecosystem services in rivers such as biofiltration, nutrient recycling, and nutrient storage (Vaughn and Hakenkamp 2001). At the whole-river scale, extensive mussel loss led to major changes in nutrient dynamics and biofiltration. Vaughn highlighted that many of the changes in ecosystem function could have been prevented had water been released from an upstream tributary to alleviate high water temperatures, which exceeded 40°C in some locations. Drought in this region is predicted to become both more frequent and more severe with climate change, as human population grows and uses more water. Two speakers in the session highlighted potential interactions between eutrophication and the effects of invasive organisms on ecosystem function in freshwaters. Cayelan Carey and colleagues presented work on the influence of lake trophic status and cyanobacterial blooms in the northeastern United States. Cyanobacterial blooms have large effects on community structure and ecosystem processes (Smith 2003), and are predicted to increase in aquatic systems worldwide due to eutrophication (Brookes and Carey 2011). Many studies have demonstrated that cyanobacteria have inhibitory effects on other plankton; however, most of this work has been conducted under high ambient nutrient conditions. Carey and coauthors examined how the trophic state of a lake could mediate relationships between cyanobacterial blooms, food web ecology, and nutrient dynamics. They found that at low ambient nutrient levels, the effect of emergent cyanobacteria had a stimulatory effect on the growth and diversity of other phytoplankton because the cyanobacteria increased water column nutrient concentrations. However, in high ambient nutrient concentrations, these effects were reversed. Predicting when and where nonnative species become established and whether these species become invasive is poorly understood, but may vary with environmental conditions such as ambient chemistry. Armored catfishes (Loricariidae) have invaded aquatic systems throughout the world and are of concern because they affect trophic and nutrient dynamics (Pound et al. 2011). Weston Nowlin and colleagues presented the results of a study examining the relationship between the growth and impacts of an introduced loricariid and nutrient enrichment in a replicated stream channel experiment. Nowlin and others found the effects of catfish were largely independent from those of nutrients, indicating that nutrient enrichment may have a limited role in mediating or exacerbating the impacts of catfishes. However, the body condition (lipid concentration and biomass) of loricariids was enhanced in the presence of increased nutrients. The work by Carey, Nowlin and their coauthors highlights the context dependence of the effects of species invasion and loss on community structure and ecosystem function. Moreover, their data suggests that the synergistic effects of multiple environmental stressors may alter the effect of species addition or loss on ecosystem dynamics in unexpected ways. One of the great challenges to understanding general patterns in functional changes in ecosystems after species invasion or extirpation is to be able to compare disparate species among study sites. Two of the speakers, Moore and Rugenski, focused their talks on understanding some of these general patterns. Anthropogenic environmental change is driving community disassembly through simultaneous declines of native species coupled with increases in nonnative species. Previous studies suggest that community disassembly is somewhat predictable, and species traits determine whether or not an organism is a successful invader or is sensitive to anthropogenic change (Zavaleta et al. 2009). Similarly, there is an increased understanding that the ecosystem consequences of community change will be influenced by the traits of species that compose the novel community. However, there is still a need to integrate patterns of community change with subsequent ecosystem consequences (Zavaleta et al. 2009). In their presentation, Jonathan Moore and coauthor examined two connected questions: First, how have communities fallen apart and how are they being put back together? Second, given the pattern of community disassembly, what are the predicted changes to ecosystem processes? To address these questions, they used existing data sets of fishes in >5000 sites in the United States to quantify spatial patterns of community disassembly across gradients of urbanization. Moore and coauthor quantified patterns of community disassembly in fishes across the United States, and they found that varying biological and ecological traits among species determined their inferred vulnerabilities to anthropogenic habitat modification. For example, some ecosystem processes were governed by allometric rules, such as nutrient excretion. Thus, distinctive vulnerabilities of differently sized taxa will drive nonlinear ecosystem consequences. Alternatively, other ecosystem processes appeared not to be linked to vulnerability. Together, these results were used to parameterize realistic extinction scenarios. The simulations revealed that habitat alteration can decrease ecosystem processes. Thus, insights into community disassembly rules can shed light on the ecosystem consequences of human-induced environmental change. Amanda Rugenski and coauthors identified patterns of changes in consumer-driver nutrient remineralization after species addition or loss across study sites and organisms. They attempted to determine what specific-species traits make organisms more apt to be drivers of ecosystem function in freshwater systems. Rugenski and coauthors proposed using volumetric excretion (Ev) (McIntyre et al. 2008) as a unifying method to assess the impacts of species additions and losses in lotic ecosystems under different environmental conditions and spatial scales. They used the three examples presented in Carla Atkinson's talk (see above) to highlight the roles of animals and their potential impact on nutrient cycling. Rugenski and others modeled Ev for ammonium (N) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) for several organisms. In the three case studies they presented, aquatic organisms had profound effects on nutrient dynamics in freshwater ecosystems. Species functional traits, such as stoichiometry and feeding behavior, were important in determining the spatial extent of an organisms' influence on nutrient dynamics. Moreover, Rugenski and others suggested the physiochemical characteristics of the environment, including nutrient limitation, discharge, temperature, and the biophysical traits of the organism (e.g., trophic state, biomass and density), were all important factors in predicting the role of organisms in nutrient dynamics. The results from their presentations highlight that uniform methods can be used to express species-specific effects on nutrient dynamics across freshwater ecosystems. In order to appropriately legislate, manage, and conserve freshwater ecosystems, it is imperative to pursue cross-habitat and cross-species comparisons to describe the functional roles of aquatic organisms in ecosystem processes. The work presented in this session and subsequent discussions highlighted that species addition and loss from freshwater ecosystems frequently results in changes in ecosystem function. Comprehensively, the presentations suggested novel functional traits, such as body and dietary stoichiometry, trophic mismatches between invaders and native food webs, and differences in behavior among species challenge the concept of functional redundancy. Altogether, presentations in the session indicate that the addition or loss of a keystone or dominant species or group of organisms from freshwaters will typically result in changes in ecosystem structure and function. Future studies should generate and utilize unifying metrics that would allow scientists and managers to compare effects of species addition and species loss across taxa and ecosystems. These metrics should be measured in conjunction with other environmental parameters such as urbanization, eutrophication, and water extraction to elucidate potentially unexpected conflicting or synergistic effects of multiple anthropogenic activities in freshwater habitats and watersheds. Part of the motivation for understanding the effects of species addition and loss is to develop management strategies that would enable human populations to utilize natural resources while sustaining natural systems and preserving the functions that are both ecologically and economically valuable. Furthermore, a great challenge that ecologists face is to quantify these changes and the subsequent losses of ecosystem services and make them relevant to the public. For example, in her discussion of freshwater mussel loss in Oklahoma rivers, Caryn Vaughn highlighted that drought in the south-central United States is predicted to become both more frequent and more severe with climate change, and water consumption will increase with population growth. Vaughn pointed out that while the frequency and severity of droughts cannot be controlled in the short term, the management of water resources can be effectively administered to maintain healthy populations of freshwater mussels and the ecosystem services they provide. Through her presentation, she emphasized the importance of quantifying ecosystem services provided by species to support conservation efforts on their behalf. There is a pressing need for scientists to quantify changes in ecosystem function into economically valued ecosystem services that can be incorporated into management and conservation efforts. We would like to acknowledge all of the coauthors of the presented talks for their contribution to these ideas and the people who attended the session.",https://openalex.org/W1995165202,1b368b94e97f7b290a570f453748c4372d388d3a,0,True,0.9519076943397522,0

Thousands of practitioners in hundreds of institutions around the world make idiosyncratic decisions about which questions to study, which organisms to use, and for how long, guided by a combination of individual predilection, inspiration from journals and books, and exchanges of progress reports and discussion at professional meetings. No synod of presbyters sets priorities, and no court of sagacious elders adjudicates disputes over which theory is the better explanation for a collection of data. From this swirling mix, principles form and a body of knowledge emerges. These are then collected into monographs and textbooks whose consistency might seem little short of miraculous, given the process. As in many academic disciplines, the epistemic basis of ecology and evolutionary biology, the set of principles and facts that we believe to be true, is the cumulative result of a remarkable self‐organizing process.Ecology and evolutionary biology are not focused on the uniform behavior of fundamental particles but on fundamental processes that unfold in a variety of contexts from a variety of histories. In that light, the most critical decision in the inquiry portion of our science is the match of question to organism (or system). That is, within this self‐organizing enterprise, how do we choose which organisms to employ to answer a question or, conversely, which questions to ask of a specific organism? If our epistemic basis is the cumulative result of these choices, then the principles and facts that emerge will be only as reliable as our choices have been wise.Here I explore how the decision to match organism to question influences what we believe to be so. In the first section, I take the pragmatic perspective of a working scientist and describe how we make the match. In the next section, I take a more formal perspective, following in part the work of Burian (1993), and describe how we should make the match; that is, I outline the criteria that ought to guide our decisions. In the final section, I explore how closely what we actually do approaches what we should do and discuss whether certain facets of our discipline warrant closer attention to the process by which we match organism to question and, thereby, derive what we believe to be so.How Do We Match Question and Organism?For many scientists, the organism leads to the question. This path is most likely when we observe some of nature's most striking phenomena, such as the synchronous mass flowering of south Asian bamboo (Keeley and Bond 1999) or the curious jugular location of the anus in pirate perch, Aphredoderus sayanus (Fletcher et al. 2004). We ask why something out of the ordinary has emerged; when we encounter mass flowering in bamboo, our first thought is not ""I wonder what the specific leaf area of these plants might be,"" nor do we observe pirate perch and wonder immediately whether the population's superoxide dismutase gene shows extensive variation.Many of us work from organism to question in more routine contexts. That is, we make an observation that interests us and then direct our questions to it. Followed faithfully, this approach usually leads to research that crosses lines between subdisciplines and often leads to some striking discoveries about the organism. For example, the work that my colleagues, students, and I performed on sailfin mollies Poecilia latipinna began when Jim Farr and I noticed that molly populations varied widely in their body size distributions and that closely adjacent populations sometimes had extremely different distributions (fig. 1). We were not the first to notice this pattern, of course (see Kilby 1955; Hubbs 1964; Snelson 1985), but we were the most tenacious in our desire to explain it. Our subsequent studies embraced behavior (Farr et al. 1986; Farr and Travis 1986; Travis and Woodward 1989; Ptacek and Travis 1996), life history (Farr and Travis 1989; Travis et al. 1989; Trexler and Travis 1990; Trexler et al. 1990), demography (Trexler et al. 1992, 1994), population genetics (Trexler 1988), reproductive biology (Trexler 1985; Travis 1989), mating system (Travis et al. 1990; Sumner et al. 1994; Ptacek and Travis 1997; Trexler et al. 1997), and physiological ecology (McManus and Travis 1998). The work revealed several striking phenomena, including facultative matrotrophy (Trexler 1985), spontaneous ovarian cycling (Travis 1989), an olfactory cue for female receptivity (Sumner et al. 1994), and Y‐linked inheritance of male body size (Travis 1994).Figure 1: Some of the animals, plants, and places involved in my own research.

Hypotheses for even the most striking observations are usually guided by theory; Janzen's 1976 essay is a masterful application of existing life‐history theory to the mass flowering of bamboo. In fact, organism‐inspired research often leads to new theory; with the passage of time, mass flowering turned out to be but one example of a broader phenomenon of synchronous reproduction, and theory aimed at that phenomenon followed accordingly (review in Ims 1990). In our molly work, although the initial question might appear agnostic to theory except in its broadest sense, the theory of local adaptation, many of the individual investigations relied heavily on existing mathematical theory for developing specific, testable hypotheses (Reznick and Travis 2001).Alternatively, the question can lead to the organism, in any of three ways. First, we may choose to employ a model system, such as Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Zea mays, or Arabidopsis thaliana, to study a problem. Model systems may be the only practical choice for problems such as mutation accumulation (Mukai et al. 1972; Fry et al. 1999; Shaw et al. 2000; Baer et al. 2005), and they are often a convenient choice for a novel approach to a conceptual question (Travisano et al. 1995; Joshi et al. 2003). Model systems offer a faster and more forgiving path for an intricate study of a general problem that can be addressed in any of many systems—at least in principle—but can be addressed more quickly or more extensively with the model system. Several excellent programs have taken this path; among them are Mueller's studies of evolution in response to density (Mueller et al. 2000), the scrutiny of the genetic response to selection on a quantitative trait conducted by Mackay and colleagues (Mackay 2001), and the exploration of adaptation to thermal regimes led by Lenski and Bennett (Cullum et al. 2001).Model systems reveal what can happen in nature but not necessarily what does happen. In this light, studies with model systems guide those of us who work with natural populations to consider what might have happened in nature and what the alternative happenings might have been. Studies with model systems have also facilitated the development of methods and techniques that can be applied to natural populations so that we can better understand what does happen in nature. This ""technology transfer"" has been especially fruitful for large‐scale evolutionary studies with Drosophila that have helped us learn not just from model systems but also about them. Examples include the scrutiny of variation in life history (Coyne and Beecham 1987), morphology (Mezey and Houle 2005), physiology (David and Bocquet 1975; Gilchrist and Huey 2004), biochemistry (Oakeshott et al. 1982), host‐pathogen relationships (Jaenike and Perlman 2002), convergent evolution (Balanyà et al. 2003), isolating mechanisms (Coyne and Orr 1997; Noor 1997), and genetic responses to global climate change (Etges and Levitan 2004; Umina et al. 2005).The second path from question to organism emerges when a sound test of theory requires a system whose features match important theoretical assumptions and a scientist with a strong natural‐history background recognizes the propriety of a particular organism or system. The work of Wilbur (1972) and Morin (1983, 1986) with amphibians on the interaction of predation and resource competition in community ecology is a clear example. Their deep knowledge of natural history is implicit in this work and was vital to its success; not only did they recognize the propriety of the systems, but they were adept at creating realistic experimental conditions in which the organisms could grow and develop as they do in nature.The third way in which the question leads to the organism occurs when a particular theory unifies seemingly disparate phenomena and, in effect, tells us to look more widely for patterns that we would not otherwise have sought. Charnov's work on the evolution of sex allocation (synthesized in Charnov 1982) is an excellent example. Charnov offered a general theory that applied to sex ratios in gonochoristic animals, the circumstances under which hermaphrodites could displace gonochores, the allocation to male and female function in simultaneous hermaphrodites, and the way optimal allocation to gender function in sequential hermaphrodites should vary with age or size. This work helped inspire a host of empirical studies in a diversity of systems (e.g., Ashman and Baker 1992; Peterson and Fischer 1996; Roy et al. 2003), and sex allocation theory remains a vibrant topic (see, e.g., Pen and Weissing 1999; Sakai 2000; Cadet et al. 2004).Finally, as individual careers progress, some of us change the questions we ask of the organisms we study, and some of us change the organisms we use to address a particular question. We do so, as Burian (1993) describes, when our curiosity about an organism leads us to new questions or when we approach the limits to an organism's utility for a particular question. Bradshaw's work on pitcher‐plant mosquitoes Wyeomyia smithii traces an arc from his early studies of mutualism between arthropods and pitcher plants (Bradshaw and Creelman 1984) through studies of life history (Bradshaw 1986) to his recent work on hourglass timers and the regulation of circadian and annual rhythms (Bradshaw et al. 2003). Conversely, Huey's work on thermal ecology and the evolution of thermal response moved from a focus on lizards (Huey and Bennett 1987) to the employment of a model system, Drosophila melanogaster (Gilchrist et al. 1997), to a scrutiny of thermal effects on adaptation in natural populations of Drosophila subobscura (Gilchrist and Huey 2004).In rare cases, some of us take the opportunity late in our careers to return to particular questions about specific organisms on which we focused years before, in order to resolve the outstanding issues. Sometimes this return is facilitated by new technology or methods and sometimes by altered personal circumstances. Perhaps the best example is Hairston's remarkable studies of how competition and predation affect the distribution and abundance of plethodontid salamanders; the experimental studies in the latter part of his career (Hairston 1980a, 1980b, 1983, 1986) were separated from the observational studies of his early years (Hairston 1949, 1951) by a rich vein of diverse ecological work (Hairston 1958, 1959, 1967, 1969; Hairston et al. 1960; Hairston and Kellerman 1964, 1965; among many others).How Should We Match Question to Organism?Two general considerations ought to dictate how we choose our organisms, that is, how we match question to organism. First, we should choose on the basis of ""suitability,"" which describes the quality of the reciprocal match of question and organism (Burian 1993). Second, we should take into account that, to borrow again from Burian (1993), the fundamental epistemology of ecology and evolutionary biology is comparative. That is, we can discover what is general only from a broad set of comparisons, and we can often understand the special case only through its relationship to the general pattern. I explore each of these considerations in turn.SuitabilityFollowing Burian (1993), we claim that a specific organism or study system is suitable for a particular question if it fulfills two requirements. First, the organism or system must be tractable for the question; that is, we must be able actually to find it and work with it. This requirement is familiar to every practicing ecologist or evolutionary biologist, and we often take great pains to assure reviewers of grant proposals that indeed we can work with a particular organism. Model systems are created when an extremely tractable organism is discovered to have peculiar but interesting properties; many organisms are easy to raise in the laboratory, but the ability to identify and delineate cell lineages made C. elegans the nematode of choice.The second requirement is that the question actually be relevant for the organism. Burian (1993, p. 353) states it slightly differently, asking ""whether the model [here the organism or system] is faithful in relevant ways to that for which it is supposed to serve as a model."" In the simplest case, we can ask whether the organism or system meets the assumptions of the theory or concept under consideration; for example, Morin (1983, 1986) selected his anuran prey and their predators because they exhibited the properties that the theory under scrutiny took as fundamental assumptions, so his system was suitable for his purpose. In a deeper case, we can ask directly whether the question itself applies to the organism. For example, the interpretation of an experimental study of the adaptive significance of cannibalism in an animal is open to question if no evidence suggests that the animal engages in cannibalism in nature. We could raise this question in many other contexts, from mate copying (Is the mating system such that copying is possible?) to predator functional responses (Do predators or parasitoids show density‐dependent attack rates in the natural range of densities?); Gunzburger and Travis (2005) have questioned the interpretation of many reports of unpalatability of tadpoles because the tadpoles were offered to predators that rarely, if ever, encounter them in nature.In a subtle variation, we can ask whether the experimental treatments employed to test a concept create a misleading result; that is, the question may apply, but the design and execution of the experiment may create artificial conditions that can bias the outcome in a particular direction. Expressed yet another way, the question applies but the experiment does not. For example, Jaeger and Walls (1989) criticized experimental studies of anuran populations and communities conducted in enclosures or mesocosms (large tanks set up as artificial ponds) because, among other reasons, the experiments up to that time had employed densities far higher than were measured in nature. The concern was that such experiments could not help but implicate an important role for biotic interactions in this system, a role that may not be fulfilled at lower, presumably more natural densities. Subsequent experiments at much lower densities (e.g., Warner et al. 1991, 1993; Gascon and Travis 1992) revealed the same effects seen in the earlier studies but found, indeed, that the strength of the biotic effects had previously been overestimated.Suitability of an organism has two important features. First, suitability can be specific to a particular context (Zallen 1993). Sailfin mollies in north Florida have proved suitable for studies of sexual selection and mating‐system variation but not for numerical dynamics; the effects of tidal fluctuations in salt marshes and the physical structure of these habitats precluded reliable sampling for population densities. Working in the Everglades, however, Trexler and his colleagues have found sailfin mollies quite suitable subjects for studying numerical dynamics, among other topics (Trexler et al. 2002).Second, the suitability of a system for a question may change as other questions are addressed and answered in the system. For example, the genetic control of pattern variation in Papilio dardanus offers important insights into the origin of mimicry, but the full utility of this system became apparent only after Nijhout's work on the developmental biology of lepidopteran wings (Nijhout 2002, 2003). The value of protein variation within many fish species for studying the genetic basis of adaptive variation improved dramatically when sophisticated methods for determining protein structure at a very fine scale were developed, along with the ability to determine the detailed sequence and structure of the genes involved (see Hochachka and Somero 2002). Suitability need not always improve; the discovery of reciprocal chromosome translocations in Oenothera lamarckiana compromised its suitability as a system for illustrating the constraints on the response to selection on quantitative traits (Provine 1971).Recognizing the Comparative Nature of Our EpistemologyThe comparative nature of our epistemology dictates three principles that ought to guide our collective choice of organisms.A well‐sampled spectrum is necessary for understanding diversity and defining generalities. To be specific, a well‐sampled spectrum serves to define the most common patterns and processes and identify the circumstances through which less common patterns and outcomes emerge. Of course, morphologists have known and applied this principle for centuries; understanding peculiar anatomical variations such as the fangs of venomous snakes or the toothless gape of egg‐eating specialist snakes requires appreciating a spectrum of ophidian skull morphology (Gans 1974). The principle is becoming well appreciated in ""molecular morphology"" as well; the spectrum of variation in the structure of the antifreeze glycoproteins in fish, when combined with genomic information in a phylogenetic context, reveals an astounding story of convergence and idiosyncrasy in adaptation (Fletcher et al. 2001).New discoveries can change tentative generalities. Although the scientific process stimulates a continuous refinement of our epistemic basis, from time to time new discoveries overturn a paradigm completely. Not all cases are historical; a recent example is the change in our view of life‐history evolution in the desmognathine salamanders. The traditional view was that direct development, the loss of the aquatic larval stage, was a recently derived life history, a sensible view in light of how few directly developing desmognathines were known and how extremely limited were their geographic and habitat distributions. However, the discovery in the 1960s of the directly developing species Phaeognathus hubrichti, a more complete understanding of species' distributions and ecology, and the employment of sophisticated molecular methods for testing phylogenetic hypotheses have combined to indicate that direct development is the ancestral condition (Chippindale et al. 2004; Mueller et al. 2004).We can identify other recent examples in which new discoveries, empirical or theoretical, called existing paradigms into question. Polis's (1991) detailed description of omnivory in a desert food web, following Paine's (1988) critique of food web theory, helped redirect that theory. Reznick et al.'s (1997) documentation of rapid evolution of guppy life histories helped usher in a new perspective on the likelihood of very rapid evolution (Kinnison and Hendry 2001; Reznick and Ghalambor 2001; Frankham and Kingsolver 2004). Spichtig and Kawecki's (2004) examination of multilocus soft selection in a subdivided population revealed that, in general, such soft selection does not protect extensive genetic variation; the impression to the contrary has been cultivated by generalization from the earliest single‐locus models of the process, and the generalization appears to have been misleading.Robust inference requires horizontal comparisons and vertical integration. Our modern emphasis on process biology puts high value on horizontal comparisons, the examination of the same question at the same level in a variety of systems. Horizontal comparisons have revealed general processes, such as the reciprocal‐yield and 3/2 thinning laws in plants (Harper 1977), trophic cascades (Carpenter and Kitchell 1993), and the preference of females for male signals associated with size or vigor (MacLaren et al. 2004). When horizontal comparisons are synthesized quantitatively, larger generalities often emerge; the patterns of biogeography are an excellent example (Brown 1984; Harte et al. 1999; Hubbell 2001).A truly robust epistemic basis for ecology and evolutionary biology also requires vertical integration, the study of many ecological and evolutionary processes as they unfold in a single species or system. Indeed, one might argue that the great challenge of biology in this century will be to connect our understanding across different levels of organization. Many of us are devoting more effort toward such integration; indeed, a number of species and systems have emerged as ""natural models"" for the study of an integrated ecology and evolutionary biology, including animals such as Poecilia reticulata and Gasterosteus aculeatus and plants such as Silene latifolia and Trifolium repens. A sampling of recent literature devoted to S. latifolia includes studies of genetic population structure (Giraud 2004; Ingvarsson 2004; Tellier et al. 2005), molecular evolution (Sugiyama et al. 2003; Ingvarsson 2004; Lengerova et al. 2004; Filatov 2005), floral genetics (Delph et al. 2004a; Meagher et al. 2005) and development (Ageez et al. 2003; Delph et al. 2004b; Matsunaga et al. 2004), nectar production and composition (Gehring et al. 2004; Dotterl et al. 2005), and invasion biology (Wolfe et al. 2004). The value of integrated knowledge is aptly illustrated in the studies by Brakefield and his colleagues on the evolution and ecology of the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana (Fischer et al. 2003, 2004; Molleman et al. 2004; Zijlstra et al. 2004; Frankino et al. 2005; Saccheri et al. 2005; Steigenga et al. 2005; van't Hof et al. 2005).Does Our Self‐Organizing System Enforce Suitability and Encourage a Comparative Epistemology?Without doubt, our system encourages one aspect of suitability, that the organism be tractable for the question. Proposals to funding agencies rarely trumpet that the proposed study organism is sparsely distributed, occurs in low numbers, is difficult to find and impossible to maintain, has critical features that cannot be measured, or is otherwise intractable for careful observation or deployment in powerful experiments. One cannot imagine a phylogenetics proposal that points out that the group to be studied has no informative characters or that the only genes that can be sequenced evolve at rates that cannot resolve the relationships among the member taxa.Whether we give sufficient encouragement to considering whether the question applies to the organism is another issue. If the literature includes declarations of prey unpalatability diagnosed from predators that do not encounter the prey (Gunzburger and Travis 2005), then it probably holds many examples of inappropriately directed questions that are less easily recognized by readers without extensive familiarity with the organism. In these cases, the organisms are being used, in effect, as analog simulations of an interesting ecological or evolutionary process. If this is the real idea behind such work, genuine digital simulations would seem a much wiser choice (see, e.g., Yedid and Bell 2001; Chow et al. 2004).Our best‐known systems, both model systems and ""natural models,"" are not random samples of their larger groups. Our model systems are, by and large, human commensals that have probably experienced rapid population growth in the last several thousand years. Although we can argue over which genetic or genomic properties might be biased by this history, expecting no bias would be naive. For example, the chiasma frequencies of domesticated mammals are not representative of those in mammals as a whole (Burt and Bell 1987). Many of our emerging ""natural models"" are cosmopolitan taxa usually found at high densities (Poecilia reticulata is an obvious exception to the cosmopolitan attribute). This is not to claim that these systems offer idiosyncratic results but to argue that we will not recognize which results are idiosyncratic without a wider foundation of comparative investigation.Whether the conclusions we draw from our horizontal comparisons are sufficiently robust depends on whether we have sampled taxonomic and character diversity properly. Although practitioners of meta‐analyses or comparative studies worry explicitly about their sampling of taxa or characters, we may not worry enough about the sampling of our examples when we attempt a synthesis or seek generalizations. We sometimes make premature generalizations or fail to appreciate fully that a particular generalization might not be robust because it emerges from a circumscribed sample of systems, a limited range of diversity, or a peculiar set of experiments. For example, the earliest studies of biochemical variation were motivated in part by the possibility that generalizations about the ubiquity of adaptive genetic variation might be overly influenced by their emergence from studies of visible polymorphisms (Lewontin 1974). In another arena, ecologists argue whether trophic cascades are a general or a circumscribed phenomenon, and one part of this argument seems, at least to me, to maintain that their apparent prominence was a premature generalization from marine and aquatic systems (Polis and Strong 1996; Oksanen and Oksanen 2000).Even less clear is that we wrestle with the sampling of taxonomic, character, and system diversity when we conceive and design our original empirical work. We often let the organism lead to the question or find the most tractable organism for a question rather than seeking an organism or system whose attributes place it in an especially critical position for understanding the broad issue at hand. Reznick's study of the life‐history diversity in female poeciliid fishes illustrates how, ideally, we would approach these problems (Reznick and Miles 1989; Reznick et al. 1992, 2002; Arias and Reznick 2000); his initial survey isolated critical questions and critical taxa, and his subsequent efforts have been focused accordingly. Of course, ""ideal"" is not always possible or practical, and most of the time the best we can do may be to build our generalities and principles gradually from the organisms and systems that are available and suitable.An emerging issue is whether we apply the criteria of suitability when we embark on meta‐analyses or other exploitations of preexisting data. Obviously, we employ the first criterion of suitability, which is tractability; the data are available, so we use them. Whether those data are faithful, in relevant ways, to the question for which they will be exploited, even though they were collected for another purpose, is the critical issue.This issue is central to an already large and still‐burgeoning literature in ecology and evolutionary biology that exploits preexisting data of one sort or another. For example, the ecomorphological community studies of Ricklefs and Travis (Ricklefs and Travis 1980; Travis and Ricklefs 1983) are based on measurements of museum specimens—one type of preexisting data—and their validity relies on the assumption that those specimens are representative samples of the morphological variation in those species in those areas. Museum or herbarium specimens have been used to approach a wide variety of topics in ecology and evolutionary biology (see recent articles by McGlynn [1999], Simberloff et al. [2000], and Knouft [2003]); some conclusions are more likely than others to be robust to collection biases.The use of tabulated and archived data in meta‐analyses and synthetic analyses carries its own risks of inadvertent bias. In some cases, such as studies of numerical dynamics, the data are being used for the same purpose for which they were collected (e.g., Kendall et al. 1998), but in others, data collected for one purpose are exploited for a different one, and in these cases the potential for bias is an important issue. For example, many early quantitative analyses of food webs exploited data that were collected as by‐products of other work (Cohen et al. 1993), and substantial biases were present (Paine 1988).The biases can arise in many ways. For example, Jeff Leips and I published a study of numerical dynamics in Heterandria formosa that included density estimates of many other species (Leips and Travis 1999).

https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01938.x,Co‐infections and the third trophic level,"The proverb ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’ is axiomatic in community ecology and the study of tri-trophic interactions. This is particularly relevant for studies of plant–herbivore–parasitoid interactions. Parasitoid wasps eavesdrop on plant volatiles emitted after plants are attacked by herbivores (De Moraes et al. 1998). This facilitates host finding by parasitoids, attack by parasitoids reduces population size of herbivore hosts (Rosenheim 1998), and the plants and parasitoids each benefit by the interaction (van Loon et al. 2000). One takes for granted the observation that most plant secondary compounds likely evolved as plant defences against natural enemies, but this was formally proposed as a mechanism only 52 years ago (Frankel 1959). Similarly, plant–insect herbivore–parasitoid interactions are key to understanding plant population dynamics and community ecology, although the conceptual framework for this is also relatively new (Karban et al. 1999). A closer look at life in the tangled bank reveals highly complex ecological interactions and evolutionary outcomes among plants, insect herbivores and the third trophic level. Taking just the case of plant–insect–parasitoid interactions, one finds that most plants are attacked by many herbivore species (co-infections), which are in turn attacked by many parasitoid species, which are attacked by hyperparasitoids, and so on. When examined in detail, such interactions can be driven by complex, unimaginable mechanisms—for example, a phage virus toxin encoded in the genomes of bacterial symbionts of aphids renders hosts resistant to parasitoid wasps (Oliver et al. 2009). Such a complex (and wonderful) ecological and evolutionary milieu might be viewed as an intellectually intractable morass. For example, two herbivorous insect species using a common host plant may compete with or facilitate one another, or may not affect the other’s fitness at all—and—the direction and strength of such interactions are likely to be highly context-dependent. Can we build a robust framework for predicting the direction and strength of plant–herbivore–parasitoid interactions in real ecological communities? Advances in network theory and competition theory are likely to be helpful in understanding how such systems work from an ecological perspective, and potentially how they evolve (Chesson & Kuang 2008; Guimarães et al. 2011). But are there more fundamental traits of plants that can be leveraged to gain insight into the direction and strength of ecological interactions within these complex communities? In this issue of Functional Ecology, Soler et al. (2012) provide fresh insight into how co-infections robustly modulate plant defence signalling, and then tests whether this influences tri-trophic interactions in a natural ecological community. Widespread signalling cross talk, primarily via the three plant hormones jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene (ET), allows plants to coordinate and fine-tune their defences against the diversity of potential natural enemies. Plants deploy distinct, but often overlapping defence strategies against biotrophic microbes, phloem-feeding insects and leaf-chewing herbivores (Stout et al. 2006). Numerous studies have examined the physiological and molecular genetic basis of plant signalling and cross talk, mostly in model plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, tomato and tobacco). Herbivores and many fungi typically induce the JA pathway and many bacterial and some fungal pathogens the SA pathway, and ET seems to be modulator of cross talk between the two pathways. While extremely insightful, these studies have led to some typological thinking—that herbivores induce the JA pathway and that bacteria induce the SA pathway. This hazard is apparent when one considers that the causative agent of bacteria speck disease (the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas syringae) in plant leaves will induce either the JA pathway or the SA depending on the presence or absence of single avirulence or virulence genes (Cui et al. 2005). This indicates that it may well be difficult to make predictions about how particular natural enemies induce plant defences, and whether this scales up the trophic cascade to predators. Nonetheless, there are widespread, repeatable and ecologically relevant cross-talk phenotypes present across host plant taxa. For example, the SA pathway and JA pathway are largely mutually antagonistic in plants. How such antagonism affects the their trophic level, as well as interactions among co-infecting natural enemies is relatively unknown, but clearly likely to be extremely important ecologically and evolutionarily (Thaler 1999). Only a handful of elegant studies (e.g. (Rodriguez-Saona et al. 2005)) have examined how plant defence hormone signalling is affected by attack from multiple herbivore species, and how this translates into effects on the herbivores and their parasitoids in the third trophic level. Soler et al. (2012) provide an important step forward by studying co-infection of Brassica oleracea plants by a leaf-chewing herbivore and a phloem-feeding herbivore. The authors cast the effects of each herbivore in terms of how their influences on plant hormone defence signalling affect two specialized parasitoid species. The principle hypotheses tested are that previous or simultaneous infection of plants with one species, from one feeding guild, influences susceptibility (performance) towards species from other feeding guilds, and that this difference in performance translates up to predators in the next trophic level. The main ecological idea is that there is fine-tuning, trade-offs and constraints faced by plants when attacked by very different natural enemies. Clever experiments allowed ecological dissection of the strength and direction of ecological interactions between each player, across two feeding guilds and to the third trophic level, through the channel of plant defence signalling. Two ecologically distinct mustard-specialist herbivore species, the caterpillar Pieris brassicae and nymphs and adults of the aphid Brevicoryne brassicae were forced to either singly, doubly or sequentially attacked a single host individual. Plant defence signalling metabolic and gene expression readouts, as well as herbivore performance and parasitoids performance data, were collected and analysed in an integrative framework. Results showed, interestingly, a susceptibility phenotype in both directions during sequential and simultaneous co-infections—which the authors interpreted as ecological facilitation. Aphids were stronger inducers of susceptibility to caterpillars than caterpillars were to aphids. This was not likely to be mediated by SA–JA antagonism, because SA levels remained relatively constant throughout the experiment. An unknown mechanism is repressing JA-levels, which were significantly lower in aphid-infested plants, and likely to be causing the increase in P. brassicae performance. The nature of the elicitor or effector causing JA suppression is unknown. The performance of both parasitoids increased during co-infections, but perhaps the most intriguing finding was that although caterpillars only affected aphid development early in their life cycle, this subtle effect translated into a positive effect on aphid parasitoid performance, which was subtle at the herbivore level. This suggests that effects from herbivore co-infection on the third trophic level may be cryptic more generally. As Soler et al. (2012) rightly point out, this is the first step in dissecting how co-infections influence ecological interactions in this model ecological system. Because the host plant is closely related to the plant genetic model A. thaliana, there is promise that functional genetic studies on plant defence mechanisms mediating the phenotypes can be identified. This manuscript also provides an excellent context for re-examining assumptions and typological paradigms in this field. For example, while competition is viewed as the most common type of ecological interaction between herbivores, this study shows that for interguild interactions, co-infections are likely to lead to facilitation. The authors also show that although co-infections may directly benefit individuals from each herbivore guild, they are a boon for parasitoids. Host plants are probably getting the last laugh after all, because bigger parasitoids likely translate into higher parasitoid fitness and with it, plant fitness. Perhaps the enemy of my enemy is a plant’s friend, but what about the enemy of its enemy’s enemy?",https://openalex.org/W2121141244,a1193193913523018f47a37db27420aece3699f1,0,True,0.9972453713417053,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13775,Quality over quantity: Trophic cascades in a warming world,"Climate change threatens all ecosystems and the organisms within them. Freshwater habitats, in particular, appear to be experiencing rapid environmental change (Almond et al., 2020; Knouft & Ficklin, 2017). Over the last decade, there has been a growing interest in the effects of warming on freshwater populations, which includes changes in abundance, body size, reproductive success and survival of a range of organisms (e.g. Hovel et al., 2017; Ledger et al., 2013; Velthuis et al., 2017; Yvon-Durocher et al., 2011). For instance, research in a natural warming experiment in Iceland has found that elevated temperatures increase the abundance of diatoms, with implications for secondary production (Junker et al. 2020; O'Gorman et al. 2017). All of this research has contributed to our knowledge that the effects of warming can be both direct and indirect. Even if there are no direct consequences of warming on a consumer population, they may suffer cascading consequences due to a change in resource availability. These 'trophic cascades' have been documented in the ecological literature for decades, from Stephen Carpenter's seminal work on fish–zooplankton–algal cascades in lakes (Carpenter et al., 1985), to more recent work on how they are altered under global change (Jackson et al., 2017; Murphy et al., 2020). For instance, warming can enhance the cascading effects of fish on zooplankton (and, subsequently, phytoplankton) by elevating feeding rates (Kratina et al., 2012). Alternatively, warming can also result in phenological mismatch, where fish fry emerges earlier in spring before zooplankton prey peaks, causing a bottom-up trophic cascade where loss of prey reduces consumer survival (Jonsson & Setzer, 2015). Importantly, research investigating the effects of warming on trophic cascades usually quantifies changes in abundance or biomass, rarely considering more subtle effects. For instance, warming can alter individual respiration rates (Cloyed et al., 2019), feeding selectivity (Gordon et al., 2018), behaviour (Kua et al., 2020) and food quality—all with consequences for other trophic levels. For instance, algae often produce less polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in warmer conditions (Fuschino et al., 2011; Von Elert & Fink, 2018), which can have implications for consumers, such as the herbivorous grazer Daphnia. This filter-feeding crustacean is incapable of de novo synthesis of long-chained PUFAs, like most other arthropods (Harrison, 1990; but see Kabeya et al., 2018), and therefore such PUFAs must be derived directly from diet. PUFAs have two main functions: they help maintain membrane fluidity, especially at low temperatures (homeoviscous adaptation; Hazel, 1995) while the long-chain PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5ω3) and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4ω6) serve as precursors for eicosanoids, a family of hormone-like substances which play an important role in animal reproduction (Heckmann et al., 2008; Stanley-Samuelson, 1994). Therefore, at low PUFA availability, Daphnia can experience performance limitations in terms of decreased growth and reproduction (Müller-Navarra, 1995; Ravet et al., 2003; Wacker & Von Elert, 2001). In other words, resource quality can be just as, or more, important than resource quantity for Daphnia and other arthropods. In this current issue of Functional Ecology, Tseng et al., investigated if changes in resource quality due to warming had consequences for higher trophic levels through trophic interactions. The authors discovered that, although algae produced more total PUFAs under warming, due to declines in cell size there was no net difference with the ambient treatment. However, the cold-reared algae produced more neutral lipids (i.e. fat content) than warm-reared algae. Somewhat surprisingly, these changes in lipid content had little cascading consequences for higher trophic levels. While Daphnia at ambient temperatures and fed cold-reared algae had higher abundance than those fed warm-reared algae, this positive effect was lost when Daphnia were kept at higher temperatures, and there were no cascading effects on the next trophic level (Chaoborus). One of the explanations Tseng et al. give for this finding is that Daphnia require less PUFAs at warmer temperatures because their role in the maintenance of membrane fluidity declines with warming (Hazel, 1995). Similar results have been observed in several other studies (Masclaux et al., 2009; Schlechtriem et al., 2006). For instance, Martin-Creuzburg et al. (2012) showed that the effect of food quality (i.e. PUFA availability) on population growth of Daphnia magna was strongest at low temperatures. Addition of single PUFAs (ARA, EPA) had a consistent positive effect on the number of viable offspring, which showed a hump-shaped temperature dependency. However, juvenile somatic growth was less affected by food quality, indicating an important role of life stage. In response to warming, food quality is not only expected to change due to altered PUFA content per algal cell but also due to changes in community composition (Ahlgren et al., 1997), as the content of essential PUFAs is taxon-specific (Ahlgren et al., 1990; Lang et al., 2011). At high temperatures and nutrient availability, bloom-forming cyanobacteria are favoured (Lürling et al., 2017; Pearl & Hiusman, 2008), which are a low-quality food as they lack essential PUFAs and sterols (Martin-Creuzburg et al., 2005; Von Elert et al., 2003). Furthermore, intraspecific and interspecific variation in consumer physiological and life-history traits might further shape their overall response to warming (Geerts et al., 2015; Vanvelk et al., 2020). For example, naturally coexisting Daphnia longispina genotypes were shown to differ in their susceptibility to PUFA limitations (Ilić et al., 2021) while Werner et al. (2019) found pronounced differences in heat tolerance within a natural population of Daphnia magna. Therefore, future studies should investigate the effects of temperature on natural communities, and monitor population dynamics and compositional changes (and thus potential food quality alterations in the phytoplankton) over time periods long enough to allow for potential evolutionary changes. Other factors not considered by Tseng et al., such as encounter rate, body size and development time of the prey, play an important role in prey–predator interactions (Pastorok, 1981). These factors are expected to be affected by warming, either directly via changes in metabolic rates, or indirectly via changes in food quality (Giebelhausen & Lampert, 2001; Lampert, 2006). Tseng et al., found that the population size of Daphnia decreased with temperature, indicating that food quantity and encounter rate for Chaoborus will also decline while neckteeth induction is expected to increase, potentially increasing handling time (Tollrian et al., 2015). Additionally, Chaoborus is a gape-limited predator (Tollrian, 1995), and therefore lower growth rates in Daphnia will result in longer time spent in the vulnerable size spectrum (Pastorok, 1981). Tseng et al.'s work highlights the need to consider quality, as well as quantity, in trophic interactions in a warming world. Moving forward, network approaches should be used to understand how stressor effects on resource quality ripple through the food web. In our rapid changing world, it is also important to consider how warming will interact with other stressors (Jackson et al., 2016), which may mitigate or amplify one another's effects on food quality with implications for cascading interactions.",https://openalex.org/W3150738946,23338c25e9f2d64d17fb145d08d88433039c5941,0,True,0.9590855836868286,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.14974,"Introduction: Special issue on species interactions, ecological networks and community dynamics – Untangling the entangled bank using molecular techniques","""It is interesting to contemplate a tangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us."" (Darwin, 1859) In the last paragraph of the Origin of Species, Darwin (1859) marvels at the diversity of life forms, the complexity of links between them and the forces creating this ""tangled bank."" In this text, we may see the origins of community ecology—today defined as ""the study of the interactions that determine the distribution and abundance of organisms"" (Krebs, 2009). To capture and quantify the key elements of this concept of community structure, we may conveniently describe communities as ecological networks (Hagen et al., 2012). In such networks, the nodes are formed by species (or other taxonomic units) and the links by their interactions (Gravel et al., 2018). Modern molecular methods offer unique opportunities for describing both elements of community structure (Roslin & Majaneva, 2016) and how they change in time and space (""community dynamics""). The last few years have seen a revolution in both sampling and sequencing technologies. For this reason, it is time to provide a sequel to the seminal Special Issue on the ""Molecular Detection of Trophic Interactions"" edited five years ago by Symondson and Harwood (2014). Building on the previous Special Issue, the current one continues the quest of ""Unpicking the Tangled Bank"" (Symondson & Harwood, 2014). Yet, where the previous compilation focused on a specific type of ecological interactions (i.e., species feeding on each other), here we have endeavoured to provide a wider community and ecosystem relevant focus. Thus, the Special Issue of 2014 was prepared by attendees at a meeting on Molecular Detection of Trophic Interactions, but the current issue reflects the collaboration between this audience and ecologists with a wider interest in ecological networks—regardless of the tools applied. Hence, the current volume is the result of synergistic back-to-back events organized at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, in September 2017: the 3rd Symposium on Molecular Detection of Trophic Interactions and the 3rd Symposium on Ecological Networks, enhanced via further networking. Many of the papers included in this volume were presented at one of these meetings, but others were added later to increase the scope and breadth of the Special Issue. The resulting issue offers a suite of studies applying molecular tools to resolving questions focused on ecological interaction networks and their dynamics. The papers included also comprise studies offering broad-ranging technical solutions for dealing with large and diverse communities, as well as reviews and summaries identifying the limits and caveats associated with quantifying community and interaction structure by molecular means. When including research with a methodological focus, we have carefully looked for particularly important and impactful studies, where the results clearly transcend the specific system studied, that is, where the methodological improvements achieved are likely to be useful for a wider range of future studies. In all other papers included in the Special Issue, the focus is on the ecology. In other words, these works deliver significant ecological findings obtained by molecular approaches. By including a blend of papers studying multiple types of interactions, taxa and realms (both aquatic and terrestrial), we hope to provide, in a single issue of Molecular Ecology, a comprehensive glimpse of the state of the art in this rapidly developing field. In particular, we hope that this issue will serve as a stimulus and catalyst for ecologists contemplating the use of molecular tools for community dissection (see also Bohan et al., 2017). Individual papers reveal how molecular tools are being fruitfully applied to many types of nodes and links, and the many types of networks formed from such elements. As an arguably thought-provoking perspective, they also show molecular techniques can be applied to describe full communities rather than their parts simultaneously—that is, to resolve multiple types of links among multiple kingdoms of taxa (Clare et al., 2019), thus opening new vistas on ""networks of networks."" Out of necessity, such initiatives so far have had to be built from multiple data sources (Pocock, Evans, & Memmott, 2012; Wirta et al., 2015). In terms of the types of interactions addressed, this Special Issue shows how molecular techniques can be applied to resolving mutualistic interactions such as pollen transport (Bell et al., 2019; Tiusanen et al., 2019) and seed dispersal (González-Varo et al., 2019), antagonistic interactions including predator–prey interactions (Deagle et al., 2019; Eitzinger et al., 2019; Mata et al., 2019; Sint, Kaufmann, Mayer, & Traugott, 2019; Verschut, Strandmark, Esparza-Salas, & Hambäck 2019 Walters et al., 2019), predator–prey-and-detritus interactions (Siegenthaler, Wangensteen, Benvenuto, Campos, & Mariani, 2019), host–parasitoid interactions (Gariepy et al., 2019; Kitson et al., 2019), host–symbiont interactions (Doña, Proctor, et al., 2019; Doña, Serrano, Mironov, Montesinos-Navarro, & Jovani, 2019), plant–herbivore interactions (Bhattacharyya, Dawson, Hipperson, & Ishtiaq, 2019), plant–fungus interactions (Schröter et al., 2019; Sepp et al., 2019), plant–prey interactions (Littlefair, Zander, de Sena Costa, & Clare, 2019), fungus–fungivore interactions (Koskinen et al., 2019) and multifaceted interactions (Clare et al., 2019). As a specific insight, the study by Doña, Proctor, et al. (2019) reveals how the application of molecular tools can even force us to re-evaluate previous concepts of the type of specific interactions. Using evidence from both light microscopy and metabarcoding, these authors show that vane-dwelling feather mites share a commensalistic–mutualistic association with their bird hosts, by feeding on fungi, microbes and detritus in the plumage. In fact, the authors find no evidence of feather mites feeding upon bird resources such as blood or skin. Consequently, the mites are recast as commensal organisms likely causing no harm but offering clear benefits to their hosts. Emphasizing the message from previous reviews (from Symondson & Harwood, 2014 to Roslin & Majaneva, 2016), the featured case studies also reveal just how much power molecular tools add by resolving ""hidden"" and hard-to-observe ecological interactions (Wirta et al., 2014). By allowing us to pinpoint associations between organisms which liquefy their prey (Eitzinger et al., 2019; Littlefair et al., 2019; Sint et al., 2019; Verschut, Strandmark, Esparza-Salas, & Hambäck 2019), hide within their hosts (Gariepy et al., 2019; Kitson et al., 2019), lack all diagnostic characters as larvae (Gariepy et al., 2019; Kitson et al., 2019; Koskinen et al., 2019), hunt at night (Mata et al., 2019) or are simply too small and similar to describe by any other means (Jones & Hallin, 2019; Walters et al., 2019), they reveal new aspects of community organization. Importantly, this is not a question of adding fine nuance to main colour, but of repainting the whole picture. Since these types of interactions form the majority of all interactions on the globe, they will profoundly affect our understanding of not only specific communities (Wirta et al., 2014), but of how communities in general are assembled and work. The findings regarding particular interactions range from insight into emergent features such as levels of specialization in ecological interaction networks (Clare et al., 2019; Doña, Proctor, et al., 2019; Doña, Serrano, et al., 2019; Koskinen et al., 2019; Sepp et al., 2019) to the role of individual seed dispersers in seed dispersal networks. As a case in point, González-Varo, Arroyo, and Jordano (2019) are able to show how much of an ecological function (seed dispersal) is concentrated to particular species at particular points in time. Migratory bird species may only be passing through an area, but still be main agents of seed dispersal for particular plants. This emphasizes the need for resolving variation in network structure through time, for which molecular techniques are ideally placed (González-Varo et al., 2019). In a similar vein, molecular diet analysis sheds new light on the trophic position of individual species within larger communities and interaction networks. Siegenthaler et al. (2019) use metabarcoding of gut contents to establish the diet of the brown shrimp, Crangon crangon, in six European estuaries. The species turns out to be an extreme generalist, feeding on hundreds of taxa, with its overall diet dominated by crustaceans, polychaetes and fish. Substantial variation in diet at both regional and local scales adds to the impression of extreme flexibility in this common species (Siegenthaler et al., 2019), but also reveals the potential for bottom-dwelling marine generalists to harvest the ""environmental DNA"" (Bohmann et al., 2014; Creer et al., 2016; Deiner et al., 2017) signal of broader fish communities for biomonitoring purposes. Where Siegenthaler et al. (2019) use molecular techniques to identify what the shrimp feeds on, Tiusanen et al., (2019) apply them to the opposite task of identifying which arthropods visit the flowers of several arctic Dryas species (all known as mountain avens). Targeting multiple sites around the Arctic, they too find an astonishing taxonomic range and richness, in this case of literally thousands of arthropod species sharing this common floral resource. Resolving such taxonomic diversity across large scales would be next to impossible with morphology-based identification approaches. Much of community ecology to date has assumed that each particular interaction is a fixed feature: If two species interact at one point in space, then they are expected to do so wherever they meet. However, recent research forces us to revisit this assumption, and add emphasis on just why interactions vary (Gravel et al., 2018; Pellissier et al., 2017; Poisot, Stouffer, & Gravel, 2015). Two papers in this issue show how molecular tools can reveal where, and under what circumstances, specific interactions occur. Bhattacharyya et al. (2019) analyse the plant contents of faecal pellets of Royle's pika (Ochotona roylei), a lagomorph endemic to the Himalayas. They show how the diet of the pika varies with elevation and with habitat structure, likely reflecting constraints and preferences during foraging (Bhattacharyya et al., 2019). Eitzinger et al. (2019) focus on a very different predator, the wolf spider Pardosa glacialis in the High Arctic. By describing the communities of both available and consumed prey along an elevational gradient, these authors demonstrate that spiders tend to prey on the same taxa—when available—regardless of their environment. However, the environment has a strong impact on available prey, and so the effect of current Arctic change will likely act indirectly, by changing what prey species are available, rather than directly modifying what is preferred (Eitzinger et al., 2019). Among predators of a different type, Littlefair et al. (2019) find an imprint of elevation on the prey community of carnivorous Sarracenia pitcher plants. Sites more different in elevation are also characterized by more different contents of the plants' pitchers. Since other studies have shown differences in free-living arthropod communities with elevation, this pattern may reflect differences in available prey rather than in realized interactions, but distinguishing between these is challenging—attesting to the need to resolve nodes and links separately in ecological interaction networks. In further evidence of the power of molecular data in resolving spatiotemporal patterning in ecological interaction networks, Jones and Hallin (2019) target communities of microbes linked by ecological function. Where nitrification pathways tend to consist of separate steps in which bacterial or archaeal communities first oxidize ammonia to nitrite, and bacterial communities then further oxidize nitrite to nitrate, little is known about how these functionally coupled organism groups co-occur in space. Here, Jones and Hallin (2019) are able to discern distinct modules of co-occurring groups of microbes associated with the two steps: Modules which occur in disparate areas are dominated by different lineages and are associated with different edaphic factors. Thus, this microbial ecology example reveals new dimensions in the structuring of ecological interaction networks: Species groups can be linked by one group preparing the metabolic substrate for another, a concept perhaps less familiar to those of us working with macroscopic taxa. Verschut et al. (2019) address how local interactions may be affected by not just one environment, but by the flow of individuals and matter between neighboring realms. Targeting terrestrial spiders living on the sea shore, these authors show how spider diets change from predominantly terrestrial prey in early summer to predominantly marine prey (non-biting midges) in late summer and autumn. Such cross-realm subsidies may prop up local population densities and expose prey to higher predator densities than if they persisted on local resources alone. The current issue shows how molecular data can reveal processes shaping communities. Tiusanen et al. (2019) study flower-visiting communities across the Arctic. By comparing patterns of phylogenetic diversity with those previously observed in plants, and by matching pairwise patterns of floristic and faunistic similarity across Arctic sites, they show that plants and arthropods have likely used similar expansion routes across the Arctic from shared refugia. This reveals a strong imprint of geological history on current patterns of community structure, beyond imprints of current climate such as precipitation and temperature (Tiusanen et al., 2019). Sint et al. (2019) describe how arthropod communities assemble once soil is exposed in front of re-treating glaciers. By revealing who feeds on what in replicate valleys of similar age, they are able to reconstruct how food webs are formed. Their findings suggest that the young food chains of glacier forelands are based on on-site processes rather than on resources blown in from other, more advanced communities. Schröter et al. (2019) compare the composition of root-associated fungi across more than a hundred temperate forest sites and find that the relative impact of different structuring forces differs across spatial scales. At local scales, forest management and tree selection have a clearer impact, but at larger scales, environmental cues and host resource traits are the most prevalent forces. From a net perspective, communities still end up very similar in terms of their trophic composition, with highly similar proportions of symbiotrophic, ectomycorrhizal, saprotrophic, endotrophic and pathotrophic fungi. Community assembly processes thus seem to secure functional resilience under the current range of climatic and edaphic conditions. Sepp et al. (2019) examine how root-colonizing fungi forming arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) are structured within a homogeneous plot of dry calcareous grassland. They find a significant imprint of host plant species, abundance and functional group on the richness and community composition of AM fungi with which they partner. Grasses host more fungal partners and appear more generalist in partner selection than do forbs. Moreover, plant species characterized by obligate rather than facultative mycorrhizal associations appear less specialized in terms of their fungal partners, as do locally more abundant plant species. Doña, Serrano, et al. (2019) take an evolutionary perspective by examining the evidence for host shifts among symbionts presumed to be highly host-specific. Building on extensive DNA metabarcoding, these authors study associations between nodes consisting of feather mite species and host bird species, finding much more variation in link structure than previously assumed. Yet, mites showed predictable fidelity in terms of host body size, and overall, the association network proved modular (i.e., some groups of bird and mite species tended to be more associated between them than with the other groups). Mites detected on unexpected hosts seemed to be there as more than just accidental tourists, with mite populations on rare hosts showing signs of both reproduction and some level of population differentiation. Overall, these patterns identify host-switching as a frequent phenomenon shaped by ecological filters such as host traits, painting a dynamic picture of the co-evolution between symbionts and their hosts. Overall, these insights regarding how communities form in space and time would be unachievable without the current molecular workflows, offering clues on both trophic position, taxonomic placement and internal relatedness. The Special Issue compiled five years ago (Symondson & Harwood, 2014) featured several papers pondering whether sequence read numbers may or may not be used to quantify the relative abundance of community members, in that case focusing on communities of prey in samples of predator diet. The papers pointed out several biases and also approaches that can adjust for them (e.g., Greenstone, Payton, Weber, & Simmons, 2014). Contributions to the current Special Issue identify the issue of what we can and cannot quantify from sequence data as a still-vibrant and partly contentious field of research. Individual papers approach this from multiple perspectives. Deagle et al. (2019) return to the issue at the heart of the previous Special Issue on dietary samples. Drawing on both critical literature analysis and simulations, Deagle et al. (2019) compare the approach of focusing on the frequency of occurrence of different food taxa across samples versus the use of relative number of sequence reads per sample. They stress that while the former approach is often advanced as more conservative than the latter, the latter may actually provide a more accurate view of population-level diet under many circumstances. Both approaches become less accurate with a higher diversity of food taxa in the samples. Bell et al. (2019) turn to mixes of pollen grains, taking an empirical approach to examining the quantitative evidence provided by controlled blends of pollen from disparate taxonomic sources. These authors demonstrate that metabarcoding is largely robust for determining pollen presence/absence, but discourage the use of sequence reads to infer relative abundance of pollen grains. Piñol, Senar, and Symondson (2019) approach related questions in silico, pointing to the fact that some experimental studies tend to report quantitative metabarcoding results, whereas similar numbers fail to do so. Hence, the question of whether metabarcoding is quantitative should actually be rephrased as when, and under what circumstances, the technique can be expected to be quantitative. They stress that ""universal primers"" will always come with more or fewer mismatches with heterogeneous sources of target template DNA, and thus focus on the number of primer–template mismatches as a metric of key interest. They show that quantitativity can be expected to vary with the primer pair used and on the characteristics of the mixture analysed, but, inspiring hope, that quantification can oftentimes be reasonably good. Lamb et al. (2019) present an empirical meta-analysis of studies published to date. Focusing on the extent to which proportions of sequence reads correspond to the original proportions of species in the community to be quantified, they find a weak quantitative relationship (slope = 0.52 ± 0.34). Yet, for a substantial fraction of studies, no quantitative relationship is detected, and neither sequencing platform type, the number of species used in a trial, or the source of DNA can account for the large variance between studies. Together, these papers point to the issue of what can, versus cannot, be inferred from sequence data as a still-vibrant and partly contentious field of research. When combined, they draw a perhaps more optimistic picture of the information value included in the read counts than contributions to the Special Issue four years ago (cf. Bell et al., 2019). Yet, each stress that for a balanced view, all sources of bias need to be considered and the methods used should be justified (Deagle et al., 2019; Piñol et al., 2019; Lamb et al., 2019). Stronger biases at particular steps of sample preparation, PCR and DNA sequencing will still blur correlations between original sample and relative sequence contents (Bell et al., 2019; Lamb et al., 2019). Using molecular tools to spot interactions between species allows us to identify potential biological control agents against invasive species. Two papers use molecular tools to scout out potential and realized enemies of invasive species. Targeting the invasive pentatomid bug Halyomorpha halys, Gariepy et al. (2019) look for links between native bugs, their parasitoids and the newcomer. Molecular analysis of egg masses reveals high parasitism rates, but the invasive species was significantly less likely to be parasitized than native confamilial species. Some parasitoid species unable to develop on the eggs of the invasive species still try to exploit them under field conditions. How this translates into parasitism in the new range is now an active field of research. Kitson et al. (2019) use nested-tagging DNA metabarcoding for exploring the parasitoid community of the oak processionary moth (Thaumetopoea processionea), an invasive species recently established in the UK. Overall, they are able to identify the main parasitoid of the late larval stages of T. processionea as Carcelia iliaca—at the same time creating the tools for describing all life stages of the oak processionary moth and the tag set needed to process massive ecological samples at the individual level. However, applications clearly do not stop at identifying the enemies of economically important species. At the community level, Hooper et al. (2019) aim to identify quantitatively dominant species in the skin microbiome of the killer whale. By describing microbial communities associated with poor and better skin health, this research may lead us to novel insights into the determinants of skin health among both larger and smaller species. All this they achieve by intensively and carefully re-analysing shotgun sequence data from hard-to-come by samples of skin biopsies of killer whales, originally taken for population genomic studies. This shows the extreme potential for extracting more biodiversity information from extant samples of rare or elusive species, even at the community level. Community ecologists tend to deal with—or at least crave for—massive data featuring both nodes and links. Perhaps, the most striking feature of the papers in this Special Issue is the large numbers involved. Here, we are not (only) referring to the high numbers of sequence reads. Sequencing power is currently increasing at a massive speed, and there is as yet no attenuation of that development in sight; quite the contrary (e.g., Loman et al., 2012). This development increases the information value generated from a single sequencing run, resulting in ever-improved resolution and precision in terms of tabulating the nodes present in the sample. Yet, equally importantly, we refer to the potential for handling and individual tagging (Kitson et al., 2019) of large numbers of samples, allowing the simultaneous characterization of massive numbers of ecological samples and taxa. In evidence of these claims, Doña, Proctor, et al. (2019) use high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and DNA metabarcoding to determine gut contents from 1,833 individual mites of 18 species inhabiting 18 bird species, whereas Doña, Serrano, et al. (2019) report findings from 25,540 individual mites (representing 64 species) from 1,130 birds (representing 71 species). Tiusanen et al. (2019) sampled 31,345 arthropods, of which they individually sequenced 13,681 individuals, detecting 1,360 barcoding BINs in the process. Schröter et al. (2019) deal with root-associated mycobiomes encompassing a total of 5,955 different operational taxonomic units across spatial scales of over 1,000 km in more than 100 temperate forest plots. Clare et al. (2019) tabulate 3,304 interactions between 762 nodes of 8 trophic functions, thus encompassing parasitic, mutualistic and predatory interactions. And the list goes on. What these figures attest to is a quantum leap in community description. By building on the tools now available for community description, we can sample very many sites in a short time, thus bypassing phenological change and other types of shift in time complicating commensurability among samples when taken sequentially rather than simultaneously. They also circumvent the taxonomic impediment by automatic species delimitation and recognition. Overall, these numbers herald a new era in community ecology, allowing us to finally view the bigger ecological picture. Together, the papers contributed to this Special Issue thus point to a fascinating development for all community ecologists: the scope for generating more relevant data in higher quantities on the key components of communities, that is, the nodes and the links of which they are built. In terms of the links, molecular data offer unrivalled benefits. Where there are multiple modes of describing the species content of a community, direct data on link occurrence are often unachievable by other means (Roslin & Majaneva, 2016). In particular, DNA metabarcoding based on nested tagging offers unique opportunities for constructing large, highly resolved species interaction networks (Kitson et al., 2019). Generation of data on species associations without rearing the organisms involved to morphologically identifiable stages bypasses both important biases and highly laborious stages of work (Kitson et al., 2019; Koskinen et al., 2019). These methods open new horizons for molecular analyses of both how communities are currently structured and how they change over time. Clare et al. (2019) point to particularly fascinating perspectives—and to particularly strong challenges ahead. What this paper proposes is this: Given that we can now delimit both nodes and links by molecular data, may we not base our full description of communities and interaction networks on such data, thus curtailing the reliance on traditional approaches? And might not such approaches prove immediate, deep insights into systems where traditional data are limited or missing, such as many tropical and/or marine environments? This is a most stimulating perspective, but also one fraught with difficulties. A key step in making sense of communities is namely to connect lists of their members with what these members are: their life cycles, size and other traits. Thus, naming a node connects it to everything that we know about what they are, what they do and how they live their lives. It is also the basis for grouping nodes into more and less similar blocks within webs, and for comparing the roles of such similar blocks among regions (e.g., ""the role of blowflies in different ecosystems""). Mapping nodes (be they defined by any criteria, morphology or DNA) onto some concept of phylogeny will significantly increase our understanding of network/community structure (Tiusanen et al., 2019), and mapping them onto known taxonomy (most papers in this Special Issue) is perhaps the easiest way to go. For each of these endeavours, we need to maintain a link between molecular barcoding, MOTUs and some aspects of traditional taxonomy (Hebert, Cywinska, & Ball, 2003; Hebert & Gregory, 2005). Whether these taxa are then named by Latin binomials or some other designations (cf. Hebert et al., 2016; Ratnasingham & Hebert, 2013) is of secondary importance, as long as we know which particular node the name refers to, and this name stays constant across community networks. Only the latter criterion will allow us to compare the role of the same node across networks (Cirtwill et al., 2018). To stress this point, we may consider contrasting scenarios. As a perhaps worst-case outcome of molecularly based food web reconstruction, we may end up dealing with unnamed MOTUs of unknown life cycle and unknown affinity to each other, with the numbers and connections between nodes varying with the similarity threshold that we use to define them and with the context of other species present in the community. Under such a scenario, molecular description of communities will contribute little insight into the ""true"" composition of the network or how it relates to other networks. But as a best-case scenario, molecular characterization of communities allows us to rapidly generate concepts of the nodes present, descriptions of who links to whom, with firm anchors in taxonomic position and what is known about the same or related species. If such approaches allow us to describe the structure of, say, a hundred replicate communities and to relate variation in their structure to, for example, variation in their functioning, then that is indeed a fantastic development. Where we are at present on the scale between these extremes is for anyone to judge, but where we should be aiming is well evident. We hope that this Special Issue showcases the true power of contemporary molecular approaches for determining ecological interactions and provides inspiration to the ecological community for the future investigation of biodiversity–ecosystem relationships.

https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00685.x,The many faces of plant carbon relations: forging an ecophysiological identity in the age of human influence,"In 1972, Hal Mooney published a seminal paper that laid the foundation for the emerging field of plant physiological ecology and its focus on carbon assimilation (Mooney, 1972). Mooney argued that environmental and evolutionary constraints on plant growth could be best understood within the context of tradeoffs in the allocation of a limited supply of C among a variety of competing functions. To this day, concepts such as allocation tradeoffs, optimization, resource-use efficiency, marginal gain, storage and other econometrics that describe resource-use patterns have dominated ecophysiology. However, now, wider issues have come to the forefront and are driving change. In this issue of New Phytologist, three Tansley reviews are presented which, together, provide a window on the synthesis that has been going on between the more traditional, theory-based side of the discipline which was reflected in the econometric analogies of the 1960s−1980s, and the newer, societal-based side of the discipline that has emerged from the need to address major environmental issues since the 1980s. ‘For plant ecophysiology, the intellectual core represented by plant carbon relations still stands as a powerful organizing principle’ Ecophysiologists, with their focus on the assimilation and allocation of C, were ideally suited to lead some of the most important studies of environmental issues during the final decades of the 20th century: these included the ecological effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and the elevated concentration of pollutant oxidants, such as ozone (O3). Key symposium proceedings were published in the early 1980s (e.g. Miller, 1980; Lemon, 1983), defining the nexus between plant function and chemical changes in the atmosphere, with the list of invited contributors reflecting the most prominent leaders in the field of plant ecophysiology at that time. Now, 20 yr later, plant ecophysiologists represent a large portion of the intellectual leadership in the disciplines that cover biosphere–atmosphere interactions and the ecological effects of anthropogenic perturbations (DeLucia et al., 2001; Norby et al., 2001). This new, applied version of ecophysiology still rests firmly on its foundation of plant C relations, providing the basis for truly mechanistic perspectives on some of the hard environmental issues facing society today. Plants produce a variety of secondary compounds primarily for the purpose of protection from biotic and environmental stresses. When oxidized in the lower atmosphere, these volatile organic compounds (VOCs) exert primary photochemical controls over tropospheric chemistry (Monson & Holland, 2001; Monson, 2002). There is reason to believe that fundamental connections exist between evolutionary constraints on C allocation and the emission rate of some compounds (e.g. monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) and environmental constraints on C assimilation and the emission rate of other compounds (e.g. isoprene and methylbutenol). Such connections should facilitate the coupling of mechanistic photosynthesis models and growth/differentiation tradeoff models to the boundary processes that frame atmospheric chemistry models. The potential of this approach is profoundly synthetic in that it brings together communities of scientists from markedly disparate disciplinary perspectives, and expands C assimilation/allocation theory into a realm that includes issues such as tropospheric ozone production, the lifetime of radiatively active trace gases such as methane, and the production and transport of organic nitrate compounds such as peroxyacetyl nitrate. In a review of the most relevant biological issues on this topic, Lerdau & Gray (pp. 199–211) make clear the differences between VOCs that leak from stored reservoirs of herbivore-deterrent, secondary compounds, and VOCs that volatilize from primary metabolic processes. In physiological terms, these can be categorized as light-independent and light-dependent emissions, respectively. The authors discuss the implications of these different processes to the development of mechanistic emission models, emphasizing the fact that light-independent emissions must be simulated from biophysical processes involving compound solubility and diffusive potential, whereas light-dependent emissions must be simulated from biochemical processes associated with primary biosynthetic pathways; light-independent emissions are separated in time from their biosynthetic origins, whereas light-dependent emissions are tightly coupled in time to their biosynthetic origins. In this analysis, the independent functional ramifications and time constants of C allocation vs C assimilation are clear. Of particular note in the review is the evolutionary perspective on the distribution of certain types of emission, especially those involving methylbutenol, a recently discovered light-dependent VOC emission from certain North American pine species. Using new information on the distribution of methylbutenol emissions, the authors highlight the complex, discontinuous pattern of expression among existing pine clades, leading to the conclusion of numerous independent origins or losses; the phylogenetic situation is similar for the case of isoprene emissions, the dominant form of light-dependent VOC emission found in a broad spectrum of plant taxa, ranging from mosses to angiosperms. They highlight the recent breakthroughs in sequencing terpene synthases, including isoprene synthase, and the potential to add insight into phylogenetic patterns. This is clearly an area for exploitation in the future. One of the big questions remaining in regard to the ecophysiological significance of VOC emissions is the reason for their existence, adaptive or otherwise. One theory that has gained some acceptance in the community involves the possible thermal protective properties of short-chain hydrocarbons that partition into lipid membranes (Sharkey & Yeh, 2001). By stabilizing critical proteins in the photosynthetic apparatus or in other membranes, VOCs such as isoprene may enhance thermal tolerance. Other theories exist to explain these emissions, however, and to date, no single theory has completely captured the discipline (Kreuzwieser et al., 2002; Penuelas & Llusia, 2002; Rennenberg & Schnitzler, 2002). Sometime between the early and late Carboniferous period, at least 450 million years ago, terrestrial plants faced a reckoning with the atmosphere – CO2 concentrations were depleted to the point where photorespiration became a significant C cost and stomata were forced to open to the point where photosynthetic water-use efficiency emerged as a dominant selective agent (Drake, 2001; Medlyn et al., 2001; Morison, 2001). Using the econometric analogies alluded to already, this was the ‘ultimate financial depression’, a time when previously evolved C investment and allocation strategies were put to the true test. Following the decreases in CO2 concentration, and during subsequent secondary decreases, novel mechanisms of C assimilation and allocation evolved, including C4 photosynthesis and active phloem loading (Turgeon, 1996; Sage, 1999; Pataki, 2002). In modern times, the potential fortunes for plants have changed again, with the earth's atmosphere returning toward a state of more abundant CO2. In the recent world, marked by profligate fossil fuel combustion and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations, many plants stand to benefit. The obvious question arises, which plants will benefit the most? In other words, what will determine the winners and losers in the competition to capitalize on the sudden increased availability of atmospheric C? In the review by Poorter and Navas (pp. 175–198), the highly successful method of growth analysis that was pioneered by Poorter and coworkers to address the question ‘why do some plants grow faster than others?’ is now applied to the question ‘why do some plants grow faster in elevated CO2 than others’. In many ways, this top-down approach defies the tendencies that developed immediately following Mooney's 1972 paper (i.e. the tendency to focus on processes on the basis of a unit of ‘leaf’, rather than a unit of ‘whole plant’). Poorter & Navas take the latter approach (Saxe et al., 2001; Jablonski et al., 2002). Using a meta-analysis of 350 experiments in which plant responses to elevated CO2 were studied, Poorter & Navas try to explain high-CO2 growth enhancement that ranges from 30% to 300%. Only 18% of the total variance in this response could be explained using species as a random factor – in other words, 82% of the total variance was due to factors other than interspecific variability. Using statistically based models, they show that a large portion of the variance is due to plant-to-plant variation in relative growth rate (i.e. intraspecific variation). There is an important experimental message here – the sampling protocols of most past studies have been inadequate to characterize the true species mean. However, there is also a more fundamental message – intraspecific variability in growth rate is relatively unexplored as an important component in the ecophysiological response of plants to their environment. Clear patterns emerged from the Poorter & Navas analysis with regard to functional groups, and certain traits appeared to correlate more strongly with an enhanced growth response to elevated CO2. In general, C4 plants exhibit less of a growth response to elevated CO2 than C3 plants; this conclusion has been lodged in the ecophysiological conventional wisdom for some time now, but Poorter & Navas provide synthetic validation across an unprecedented number of independent studies. The trait most able to predict a species’ growth response to elevated CO2, whether present in herbaceous or woody species, is the inherent relative growth rate (i.e. species with the highest growth rates in normal CO2 exhibited the strongest growth response to elevated CO2). Presumably, genetic controls over traits such as short cell-cycle time, which underlie rapid growth rates, also facilitate maximum capacities for utilizing increased C assimilation rates. With the correlational framework provided by the Poorter & Navas study, the stage is set for mechanistic probes into the underlying causes of differences in relative growth rate, and thus differences in the response to elevated CO2. The oxidative power of the lower atmosphere is ultimately determined by the tropospheric O3 concentration. It is tropospheric O3 that photolyzes in the presence of UV-B radiation, causing the production of oxidative radical species, such as the hydroxyl radical and hydroperoxide radical, which ultimately drive oxidative photochemistry to form more O3. Basically, ‘it takes a little O3 to make a lot more O3’. The tropospheric O3 concentration has been increasing for several decades (Brasseur et al., 1999). This trend is traceable to human activities, particularly the emission of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides during the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass burning. The increase in tropospheric O3 has caused significant detriment to the primary productivity of agricultural and natural ecosystems (Furher, 2002). In a review that emphasizes physiological processes, Andersen (pp. 213–228) makes clear the fact that O3 disrupts the assimilation of C in leaves, as a primary effect, and thus decreases the supply of C to roots, as a secondary effect. In leaves, O3 is known to cause reductions in stomatal conductance and to damage photosynthetic membranes and proteins. In causing secondary leaf responses, O3 damage induces the increased use of carbohydrates to repair damage, synthesize antioxidant compounds and compensate for tissue loss (O3 is also known to inhibit phloem transport, although the causal mechanisms are still unclear). The net result of O3-induced inhibition to these leaf-focused processes is to reduce the rate of carbohydrate transport to below-ground tissues, causing concomitant reductions in root biomass and root carbohydrate storage pools. Andersen spends a considerable portion of his review discussing the potential ramifications of decreased carbohydrate transport to roots on higher–order below-ground interactions, including infection by mycorrhizal fungi, decomposition of leaf litter and integrated connections in soil food webs. Very little research has actually been done on the effects of O3 on these interactions, so Andersen takes the approach of synthesizing fundamental research on the processes that compose the interactions, with clearly articulated hypotheses about the anticipated effect of elevated O3 concentrations. Basic principles underlying C allocation and source–sink dynamics can be used as a predictive framework in this regard, providing the basis for broadly synthetic predictions with wide-ranging ecophysiological effects. It is clear from Andersen's review that synthetic approaches, founded on the economics of C relations, are likely to yield large dividends in the study of the effects of O3, a field that has been hampered by disparate results with few central organizing principles. As an example, consider the issue as to how the formation of mycorrhizas is influenced by, and in turn influences, plant responses to elevated O3. Intuitively, decreases in the rate by which carbohydrates are transported to roots should, in turn, decrease the potential for infection by mycorrhizal fungi. However, Andersen points out that numerous studies have shown an increase in mycorrhizas under O3 stress, although it tends to be a transitory increase. Andersen offers the hypothesis that the transient increase is due to a short-term pulse in the availability of root carbohydrate reserves to mycorrhizal fungi immediately after initiation of the O3 stress. According to the hypothesis, this pulse is an expected response if decreased carbohydrate transport to roots causes the down-regulation of hexose metabolism genes in roots, but the mobilization of root carbohydrate reserves remains constant, or increases. This example makes clear the potential for integrated plant C relations to explain what might otherwise appear to be distinct O3-induced processes (inhibition of photosynthesis and stimulation of mycorrhizas) mitigated by separate above- and below-ground responses. As biology becomes more complex and fractured into subdisciplines, synthetic approaches are all the more needed and appreciated. No field has grown and fractured more than plant ecophysiology – in the mere 30 yr since its emergence from a core of concepts involving plant C and water relations, the field finds itself now as a sphere of widely displaced boundaries, often with little semblance of a core. Ecophysiologists have diffused upward in large numbers to fill mechanistic needs in the fields of biogeochemistry and global earth systems, and downwards to explain the functional significance of sequenced and mapped genes in the fields of genomics and molecular systematics. The societal needs in these areas are immense and pressing, leading to unprecedented funding opportunities for scientists in all disciplines. The intellectual domain of a discipline, however, is only capable of stretching so far as these opportunities are pursued. In the case of plant ecophysiology, the intellectual core represented by plant C relations still stands as a powerful organizing principle, capable of stimulating well articulated foundations upon which some of the most recent, state-of-the-art syntheses can occur. Future progress in deciphering the mechanistic underpinnings of earth processes and their relationship to human-driven change will no doubt receive considerable benefit from intuitive, well-tested concepts that were pioneered during the formative phases of plant ecophysiology.",https://openalex.org/W2077960986,ac10c351607c67dcfb2965d645a2b235557f0b87,0,True,0.9546359777450562,0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2023.11.006,Non-additive effects of multiple predators alter the biological control of the coffee leaf miner (Leucoptera coffeella),"Although most prey are attacked by multiple predators, much ecological theory on prey suppression focuses on the effects of a single predator. The presence of multiple predators can lead to complex effects such as trait-mediated interactions (TMIIs) and intraguild predation which can influence the suppression of pest populations. Here we explore the effect of two predators, a native anole lizard species Anolis cristatellus (Squamata: Dactyloidae) and a non-native ant species Wasmannia auropunctata (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), on the coffee leaf miner, Leucoptera coffeella (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae) (CLM). In a laboratory experiment we examined the effects of these two predators in isolation and when co-occurring. Our results show that when each predator is alone, they are able to consume the CLM in a comparable way. However, when they are together, their effect is not greater than when alone. This indicates that there is a negative effect when both predators co-occur. The results from this experiment have practical implications since both predators are present in coffee agroecosystems in Puerto Rico, where the CLM is considered the main insect pest. Furthermore, these results demonstrate the potential dynamics among several predators in agroecosystems and the potential implications for herbivore regulation.",https://openalex.org/W4388948536,e49b4f5adadb46b509ae1e5cd5339280741bed6c,0,True,0.9941703081130981,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.1809,Farmers' delivery of floral resources: to “bee” or not to “bee”,"Agriculture is the most widespread use of land on Earth and one of the greatest drivers of biodiversity loss (Green et al., 2019). In the contiguous United States, over half of the land is devoted to agricultural production (NASS, 2021). Globally, simplified and intensively managed agricultural landscapes have replaced diverse farming systems, reducing biodiversity and ecosystem services essential to agricultural production such as pollination, pest control, and soil health (Le Provost et al., 2020). Understanding how land use can optimize both biodiversity and food security is essential to halting the negative environmental impacts of increasingly intensive use of agricultural land. To address this challenge, we propose a research approach that integrates landscape-scale remotely sensed data with trait information of wild and crop plants. This integrative framework generates multiscalar (field to landscape) depictions of agroecological outcomes (yield and biodiversity) associated with a particular land-use context. We apply this approach (Box 1 and Figure 1) to pollinators, providers of vital ecosystem services to both crops and wild plants (Kremen et al., 2007), by linking land use to both pollinator health and crop yield. 1. Define study area: Using open-source rasterized land use data, such as the USDA CropScape data set, identify the type of land-use in the region of interest (e.g., specific crops, semi-natural and natural habitat). 2(A). Quantify floral resources in the field: Collect field data from randomly sampled transects across the agricultural landscape by measuring traits on a plant such as nectar volume and sucrose concentration on a sample of flowers, quantify the number of flowers on a plant across the season to provide a temporal component, then determine biomass and density of plants. 2(B). Quantify indicators of environmental health: Sample response variables (abundance and diversity of pollinators) of each land-use patch using randomized standard sampling methods. These samples are taken simultaneously with sampling of floral resources (2A). 3. Geospatially anchor floral resource information to generate the floral resource landscape: Number of flowers are typically highly correlated with the size of the plant. Plant biomass combined with plant density can then be used to predict caloric resources on higher scales (e.g., plots in a field, fields, and landscapes within a given radius of the sample). Thus, for each land-use category, generate a distribution of plant density based on observed field observations. From plant density, project anticipated floral resources on each pixel based on relationships derived from field observations. The floral resources landscape is predicted through regression analyses: temporal and spatial distribution of floral resources = measurements of individual plants across the flowering phenology (number of flowers) and floral resources (nectar, pollen) weighted by crop or wild plant densities. Floral resource information (nectar volume and sugar concentration) for plant and crop species is also accessible from large-scale open-source data sets (e.g., Kattge et al., 2020). 4. Link agroecological outcomes to the floral resource landscape: Link response variables (crop yield, wild-plant seed production, pollinators) to the floral resource landscape. Estimate wild and crop yield based on fertile seed count from a random sample of focal individuals within each land-use type or this information can be accessed by yield estimations from county-wide U.S. Department of Agriculture yield data (if available for the region) or by remotely sensed vegetative proxies (Brogi et al., 2020). Thus, for every point in the landscape, one can predict (using regression approaches) the relationship between floral resources and agroecological outcomes based on survey information of floral resources provided by different plants and their densities and the agroecological parameters of interests. 5. Simulate optimized landscapes: How might land-use reconfiguration shift outcomes based on the estimated parameters? Link spatiotemporal composition and distribution of floral resources in an agricultural landscape with landscape indicators of biodiversity (Koh et al., 2016) and county-scale yield data. Thus, policy makers can identify scenarios of land-use composition and configuration at the landscape scale that minimize biodiversity loss while supporting agricultural and wildflower production (1B). Agriculture reconfigures the spatiotemporal distribution of wild and crop plants, that affects important ecological drivers of agricultural production: pollinator services and pollinator health (Hellerstein et al., 2017). Quantifying the distribution and composition of floral resources in agricultural landscapes allows us to understand the interactions between agricultural land use, pollinator health, and agricultural outcomes. Depending on the distribution and availability of floral resources across the landscape, pollinator diversity and abundance is promoted or depressed (Schulte et al., 2017). Thus, we focus on the resources (or interaction currencies that mediate pollinator–plant interactions, Kissling et al., 2012) directly related to the energetic requirements of pollinators (Heinrich and Raven, 1972), that is, the density of sugar resources or kilocalories per hectare. By classifying the landscape based on resources available to pollinators, we can reduce complexities such as plant species composition, competition, or facilitation among pollinators and or plants into a single parameter that has great explanatory power for community-level processes (Nottebrock et al., 2017). Reducing the landscape to a map of available resources may more easily contribute to land-use decisions that both improve pollinator nutrition and enhance pollination services to agricultural systems. As depicted in Figure 1 and Box 1, we generate floral resource maps by linking field measurements of floral resources such as nectar and pollen with land-use categories derived yearly for the continental United States from remotely sensed data that is compiled into matrices (rasters) of pixels where each pixel value represents a land-use category (e.g., USDA CropScape). Land-use categories correspond to land planted with different crops (e.g., corn, soybean, fallow) or non-crops (e.g., herbaceous wetlands, grasslands) and are georeferenced satellite imagery with moderate resolution (30–50 m) and extensive agricultural ground truthing. Floral resource maps should reflect the composition of crops, field margins, and non-crop areas. CropScape does not provide species composition for non-crop areas that consist of native and non-native plants. Thus, the density of floral resources that specific non-crop plants provide need to be quantified within each locale. The quantity of floral resources provided by each land-use category for pollinators can then be assigned simplified energetic resource values (kcal/ha). Each land-use type at a geospatial location is also linked with field measurements of agroecological outcomes, e.g., crop yields and pollinator diversity and abundance. By linking the different categories of land use to the amount of floral rewards for each land use collected from field surveys, we can estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of floral resources on the landscape. We can then link this distribution of land-use types with key agroecological outcomes (i.e., crop yield and pollinator health) across landscapes covered by different combinations of crop, natural and semi natural environments. Because we are integrating across individuals to generate predictions of pollinator resources (ecosystem function) at a given scale, we call this individual trait surface a floral resource landscape. Landscape-level analyses matter not only for ecological outcomes but also for the formulation of best farming practices. For example, Stiles et al. (2021) demonstrated that increased landscape diversity (measured as Shannon's diversity index with land use quantified in CropScape) in the South Dakota Prairie Coteau (a roughly 50,000-km2 plateau that rises from the flat prairies of western Minnesota and eastern South Dakota) resulted in higher pollinator diversity and higher yield in experimental plots of the new oil crop, Brassica carinata. Thus, landscape-level management that increases pollinator diversity could increase farmers' net profitability by replacing costs associated with inputs such as tillage and neonicotinoid seed treatments. Similarly, analyses at the national level find that more diverse agricultural landscapes are associated with significantly higher yields of the major crops (Nelson and Burchfield, 2021). While there are an increasing number of studies demonstrating that both ecological outcomes and the economic interests of farmers can be simultaneously optimized (e.g., Dainese et al., 2019), the resource landscape approach may enhance our mechanistic understanding of how shifts in land-use composition and configuration iteratively alter key coupled agricultural and ecological outcomes. The floral resource landscape approach can generate the necessary information about where and how we need to improve the availability and distribution of floral resources in the agricultural landscape to improve pollinator services and environmental health. Since pollinator health is correlated to landscape attributes that generally enhance biodiversity (Kremen et al., 2007), our landscape resource approach may reveal the relationship between landscape use and other biodiversity driven ecosystem services. We acknowledge that diverse resources are also important to sustain the biodiversity of pollinators, in addition to our proposal of the simple measure of kilocalories per hectare. Different pollinators do not necessarily forage on the same plants, and different plant species produce pollen and nectar of different nutritive values that can differentially affect pollinator health. We suggest that plant diversity, including crop and non-crop species, may be used as a proxy for resource diversity. Since pollinator services to crops depend on pollinator access to natural habitat for foraging and nesting (Kremen et al., 2007), models to assess pollinator services to crops should also assess aspects of landscape diversity and plant diversity, including the contribution of natural areas. However, the novelty and advantage of quantifying floral resources is that this approach reduces a complex landscape to a relatively easily measurable parameter that can be compared across spatial and temporal scales and plays an intuitively important role in pollinator health. For example, in our studies of pollinators communities found in remnant grasslands of the Prairie Coteau, landscape composition surrounding the sampling sites did predict pollinator diversity, but the sugar resources at the site were a better predictor of pollinator diversity and plant–pollinator interactions (Vilella-Arnizaut et al., 2021 [Preprint]). Since landscape use and their policy drivers are so important, we suggest that the floral resource landscape is, at the very least, a valuable informative parameter in addition to other measures of landscape diversity that have been previously studied. Because humans are directly responsible for the composition of agricultural and surrounding semi-natural landscapes (i.e., humans as keystone species; Moll et al., 2021), increasing the sustainability of these landscapes requires further understanding of the underlying political and economic factors that shape land-use decisions. The research approach described here can be used by policy makers to optimize biodiversity and food security. For example, in the United States, land use is strongly influenced by U.S. agricultural policy, particularly the U.S. Farm Bill, which is the major policy mechanism driving how and where food is produced and how land is used in the United States (Spangler et al., 2020). Federally subsidized crop insurance reduces the risk of bringing new, predominantly marginal land into production (Lark et al., 2015), which has contributed to declines in agrobiodiversity (Aguilar et al., 2015) and ecological health (West and Six, 2007), causing concern for the sustainability and viability of crop production. Sustainable landscapes can then become additional targets for policy changes to enhance regenerative farming practices and ecosystem services that include maintaining pollinator diversity and abundances. The individual-trait-based landscape approach that we advocate can be used to optimize the construction of sustainable landscapes by quantifying how land use affects the configuration and complexity of floral resources. Changes as simple as increasing the number of crops eligible for crop insurance, including native grasses for biofuels in the crop insurance program, or increasing funding per acre of land transferred to the Conservation Reserve Program would make for a more sustainable agricultural landscape. Furthermore, the social factors, such as adherence to different measures of the U.S. Farm Bill at a county or finer scale, can be overlaid on the previous geospatial data to directly relate social behaviors with land use and ecosystem function and services. To summarize, the novelty and advantage of quantifying floral resources is that they can be integrated with other landscape descriptors, including landscape composition, diversity, and configuration, and related to agricultural policy driving human choices to provide a roadmap to environmental sustainability.

https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01865.x,"Bergmann’s rule, natural selection and the end of the Panglossian paradigm in ecogeographical analyses","Geographic patterns of population differentiation have traditionally been at the centre of debate about the relative magnitudes of various evolutionary and ecological mechanisms, especially the association between phenotypic variation, climate and speciation dynamics. This is exemplified by the classical debate between R. A. Fisher, E. B. Ford and S. Wright about the deterministic and stochastic mechanisms structuring phenotypic variation in British populations of the butterfly Panaxia dominula during the 1940s, which, in part, contributed to the establishment of the foundations of ecological genetics (Provine, 1986). More recently, however, the development and increasing use of molecular markers seems to have created a shift of interest in the analysis of population differentiation to a focus on neutral processes of isolation of genetic lineages and their correspondence across multiple taxa, in a phylogeographic context (see Riddle & Hafner, 2004). On the other hand, morphological variation has been analysed in an explicit biogeographical framework since the 19th century (see Lomolino et al., 2006). One among other ecogeographical rules, Bergmann’s rule states that, within warm-blooded vertebrate species, organisms living at higher latitudes or altitudes (colder climates) are generally larger than those living in warmer regions and at lower altitudes (Meiri & Dayan, 2003; Rodríguez et al., 2006). The current interest in this pattern is reflected by the numerous recent papers evaluating its generality in mammals, birds and many other organisms, including ectotherms (see Gaston et al., 2007, for a recent account of the multiple methodological strategies used). The existence of long-distance clines in body size within and among species has been attributed to natural selection. These patterns are usually evaluated by simple correlations between body-size measurements and climate, but the existence of these correlations does not rule out other confounding factors that could also explain the same clines. Although more complex methods of spatial and comparative analyses could be used to distinguish between alternative scenarios of phenotypic evolution along clines, they are hardly used. Diniz-Filho et al. (2007) developed a methodology to distinguish between historical non-adaptive components and current climatic factors generating Bergmannian clines. They showed that the unique intraspecific component of body-size variation in European mammals is significantly correlated with the magnitude of Bergmann’s patterns within each species, and that body-size evolution within each species is independently correlated with climatic factors (mainly temperature). This reinforces the role of natural selection in shaping these clines and indicates that Bergmann’s rule can be better understood as an adaptive process caused by a response to current climatic factors rather than as a consequence of historical non-adaptive factors associated, for example, with faunal turnover. Adaptive processes are indeed the best candidates for explaining multiple Bergmann’s clines across several species, although the physiological and ecological mechanisms underlying these clines deserve further investigation (see Rodríguez et al., 2006). However, the practice of assuming adaptive processes without considering other possibilities is now usually a sign of ‘bad science’ and reflects a somewhat dogmatic position reminiscent of what Gould & Lewontin (1978) termed ‘the Panglossian paradigm’ in evolutionary biology. Following the tradition of R. A. Wallace and A. Weissman (but not Darwin), the hyperselectionist approach states the omnipotence of natural selection in forging biological design and claims it to be‘…so powerful and the constraints upon it so few that direct adaptation through its operation becomes the primary cause of nearly all organic form, function and behavior’ (Gould & Lewontin, 1978). Following Darwin’s original pluralistic spirit, however, it is necessary to consider alternative models of evolutionary dynamics to better understand the origin and maintenance of body-size clines and other ecogeographical patterns. Analyses integrating genetic markers (which allow expected patterns to be established under neutral processes of population differentiation) and phenotypic variation along climatic gradients could be a powerful way to disentangle the multiple factors that may be involved in Bergmannian clines. These factors may include natural selection and adaptation (to climatic conditions), genetic drift after isolation, hybridization among closely related species, and character displacement by competition. Guillaumet et al. (2007) have taken a valuable step towards such an analysis by using molecular markers and an individual-based approach to investigate the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms driving body-size clines in larks of the genus Galerida in Morocco. Guillaumet et al. (2007) analysed in detail three partially sympatric species of Galerida (G. theklae, G. cristata and G. randonii) across altitudinal gradients. Galerida theklae is the most widespread species, and in the north-western part of its range it is sympatric with G. cristata, whereas in the south-eastern part it is sympatric with G. randonii. These distributional patterns imply that, beyond Bergmann’s effects (which, in turn, could be explained by alternative mechanistic models based on environmental conditions), body-size clines in these species could be affected by competition (mainly between G. theklae and the two other species) and by hybridization (between G. cristata and G. randonii, which form a hybrid zone). Body size was defined as the first principal component of six morphological traits (in log scale), explaining about 70% of the covariance among them. Guillaumet et al. (2007) used an ingenious method to include these two processes (hybridization and competition) in the models of body size for a given ‘focal’ species, analogous to generating an autoregressive term for a logistic regression analysis. They created geographically structured variables by assigning to each locality, as new predictors, the value of average body size of the other individuals of other species (which could potentially compete or hybridize with the focal species) in the neighbouring area, using two different spatial functions. RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) of the cytochrome b gene of mitochondrial DNA was used to classify individuals and create the hybridization variable used to test for hybridization between species. An information theoretical approach of model selection (using the Akaike information criterion) was then performed to establish minimum adequate models explaining body size in each species, based on the effects of temperature and aridity, altitude, position as regards the Atlas Mountain chains (a surrogate for isolation), sex, hybridization and competition. Spatial autocorrelation was taken into account, using simultaneous autoregressive models (SAR), when necessary. Notice that the unit of analysis in the study is the body size of individuals from different species, creating an additional level in Gaston et al.'s (2007) recently proposed framework for dealing with ecogeographical rules. Sexual dimorphism appears as a strong component of the models, for all species, indicating that differences between males and females are relatively large when compared with other intraspecific components of body-size variation. However, after taking this into account, Bergmann’s rule was supported by G. theklae and G. randonii, since altitude (used here as a surrogate for temperature) emerged as part of the minimum models for these two species. These minimum models include other combinations of predictors, however, showing that complex ecological and evolutionary processes drive body-size variation in each species. In short, for G. theklae, the most widespread species, individual body size is affected by sex, altitude (and its quadratic expansion), position along the Atlas chain, and aridity. This shows that, beyond adaptive processes, allopatric differentiation caused by elevation patterns explains part of the variation in the species, as may primary productivity (inversely correlated with aridity). For G. cristata and G. randonii, hybridization (but not competition) appears as a significant component of body-size variation. For G. cristata, aridity also appears as a significant predictor, suggesting that primary productivity is an important factor driving body-size variation. Although further experimental studies could provide more detailed answers concerning the relative roles of these ecological factors (and concerning the genetic component underlying body-size variation necessary for adaptive explanations), the methodological approach used by Guillaumet et al. (2007) illustrates the robustness of classical ecogeographical interpretation. Even when these classical adaptive explanations are supported, however, the innovative aspect of the study is to evaluate its robustness when other confounding effects are taken into account, thus avoiding the pitfalls of the Panglossian paradigm. In its first phase, macroecology was concerned with looking for general patterns at broad geographical and evolutionary scales, so that a renewed interest in ecogeographical patterns (such as Bergmann’s rule) emerged. More recently, more sophisticated methods and new data have been used to test the generality of these rules for multiple species, taxonomic groups, biogeographical regions, and environmental conditions (see Ashton, 2002). Given that generality was established (at least partially) by these initial exploratory studies, it is now time to move on and start investigating in more detail the potential mechanistic processes underlying these patterns. Although experimental studies are usually difficult to perform (and are sometimes unfeasible) at macroscales, the methodological approach proposed by Guillaumet et al. (2007) can be expanded and generalized to include a multiplicity of factors, providing a powerful means to establish relationships between processes and patterns based on observational data. Conceptually, escaping from the Panglossian paradigm and taking into account other confounding factors is a good way to create a conceptual shift in ecogeographical analyses, moving from a purely descriptive and observational approach towards a more theoretically and methodologically oriented science.

https://doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10391,Whales and cephalopods in a deep‐sea arms race,"Millions of predator–prey interactions between deep-diving toothed whales and cephalopods occur daily in the dark deep sea. While predatory whales developed traits to detect and hunt their prey, cephalopods had to expand their anti-predatory strategies specialized for visual predators, to counteract acoustic predators. Since toothed whale-cephalopod interactions have never been directly observed in the deep sea, it remains unknown what selective pressures and traits evolved from this arms race. Combining current knowledge, we formalize four hypotheses and associated research approaches that will guide future investigation on oceanic predator–prey systems. We identify whale echolocation as an unprecedented armament to hunt distant prey and propose that deep-sea squids avoid acoustic predators by (1) reducing their acoustic cross-section through body shape and posture, (2) deep-sea migration, and (3) not schooling. Toothed whale predation emerges as a potential driver of the cephalopod live-fast-die-young strategy—which may now leave cephalopods at competitive advantage under global change. The pelagic deep sea is an enormous three-dimensional space that poses unique selective pressures. In absence of sun light, the dominant forms of communication are bioluminescence and sound. Diverse, abundant taxa inhabit the pelagic deep sea (water column >200 m). These taxa range from microplankton to meganekton, which may aggregate and migrate, resulting in a dynamic system with patches of high biomass—and rich hunting grounds for oceanic predators. Toothed whales are mammalian top predators that occur in all oceans. Many of these, including beaked and sperm whales, hunt for deep-sea cephalopods, in particular squids (Clarke 2006) (Fig. 1). They have evolved a range of morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits enabling prolonged breath-hold dives to 100 or 1000s of meters (Kooyman 2009). Deep-diving toothed whales (i.e., odontocetes routinely foraging deeper than 200 m) are efficient, often generalist predators, daily capturing hundreds of prey (Visser et al. 2021). Most cephalopods are fast-growing, relatively short-lived predators with a single reproductive cycle followed by death (semelparity), a life history adaptation that is possibly driven by a massive increase in predation pressure subsequent to the evolutionary loss of the external shell (Amodio et al. 2019). Their size and high gonadal investment makes them nutritious prey (Boyle and Rodhouse 2005). The evolution of cephalopod avoidance strategies is strongly rooted in their response to predominantly visual predators. Cephalopods have co-existed with their main predators, fishes, for 530 million years (Jaitly et al. 2022). The much more recent entry of mammals into the marine realm and ensuing evolution of predatory toothed whale echolocation (34 million years ago), created strongly different selective pressures on cephalopod adaptive strategies to avoid predation—this time by acoustic predators. The resulting evolutionary arms race in predator–prey adaptations has shaped the cephalopods and toothed whales into the organisms roaming our modern oceans. Their interactions, however, remain unobserved, and unknown. Have pelagic cephalopods succeeded in eluding large, warm-blooded predators geared for long-range detection of prey? Which traits drive the deep-sea arms race between toothed whales and cephalopods? Here, we combine the current knowledge on deep-diving toothed whale predators and their cephalopod prey (focused on oegopsid squids) to reconstruct their sequence of predatory interactions, from search to selection and capture. In the light of current ecological concepts, we form four testable hypotheses supported by research approaches, advancing to a scientific framework that will help understand the selective pressures shaping deep-sea predator–prey systems. Cephalopods can sense vibrations using a system analogous to the lateral line system of fishes, and rely on advanced visual capabilities to detect their predators (Jaitly et al. 2022). The unusually large eyes of giant squid allow detection of the bioluminescent trail stimulated by approaching whales (Nilsson et al. 2012). Histioteuthids, a dominant prey for many toothed whales, have dimorphic eyes. Oriented obliquely in the water column, the large upward-looking eye is likely used to detect prey, and predator silhouettes. The smaller downward-oriented eye visualizes bioluminescent point sources (Thomas et al. 2017). Marine species avoid predators via various strategies, including gigantism, speed, external defensive structures, crypsis, and schooling. Cephalopod gigantism, as found in giant squid Architeuthis sp. and colossal squid Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni, is exceptional. Most oceanic squids have mantle lengths <500 mm (Jereb and Roper 2010). Although many squids are agile and powerful swimmers (e.g., Gonatidae, Ommastrephidae, Octopoteuthidae), certain taxa have limited escape responses (e.g., Histioteuthidae, Chiroteuthidae). Cephalopod oxygen-binding protein (hemocyanin) is less efficient than the myoglobin of their mammalian predators, leaving them at physiological disadvantage (Seibel 2016). The absence of an external shell limits the capacity for physical confrontation. Instead, cephalopod primary defense is to avoid detection, through physical and behavioral crypsis (Jaitly et al. 2022). To hide in a featureless epipelagic and mesopelagic environment where some light still penetrates, some cephalopods use their mantle for cryptic cover (e.g., Japetella heathi and Onychoteuthis banksi) (Zylinski and Johnsen 2011). They can effectively switch between varying degrees of mantle pigmentation, counterillumination, shape and sometimes transparency, to optimize their camouflage to fluctuating light conditions (reviewed in Jaitly et al. 2022) and hide from visually attuned predators. To avoid predation in the only, and critical reproductive phase, many deep-sea squids (e.g., Cranchiidae, Gonatidae, Histioteuthidae) perform ontogenetic migration (Boyle and Rodhouse 2005), resulting in larger individuals occurring deeper, or close to the seafloor. This ontogenetic migration poses a constraint for the mammalian predators, as per their need for oxygen. Once detected, cephalopods may startle or confuse predators, through inking, bioluminescent flashes, retaliation with beaks and armature, or even autotomy (Jaitly et al. 2022). In the absence of light, toothed whales detect prey using echolocation (e.g., Jensen et al. 2018). Irrespective of body size, species have converged on a relatively narrow acoustic beam (the sensory field of view) and hyperallometric investment into sound production structures. Combined, this suggests a strong selective pressure for a sensory system optimized for long-range (i.e., high power), high-resolution detection of individual or patchily distributed prey (Jensen et al. 2018). It creates an especially powerful long-range sense, with an estimated detection distance of 100 s of meters for the larger toothed whales (Fais et al. 2015; Jensen et al. 2018) (Fig. 2). Hunting whales thereby, have a rapid, detailed, and unobstructed overview over large water volumes. In comparison, elephant seals (Mirounga sp.), large nonecholocating marine mammals targeting the deep scattering layer, have a prey detection range of 7–17 m and require foraging trips of more than 100 km to detect sufficient prey (Chevallay et al. 2023). Teuthophagous toothed whales use sonar frequencies that have strong energy in the 10–40 kHz band, which is also where some cephalopod species reflect sound most strongly (Benoit-Bird and Lawson 2016; Jensen et al. 2018). Conversely, provided they share the same general auditory anatomy as their shallow-water relatives, deep-sea cephalopod prey are likely ""deaf"" toward the echolocation frequencies and remain unaware of remote, approaching whale predators (Wilson et al. 2007). The cephalopod will only sense its predator at close range (tens of meters; Fig. 2), visually, or due to particle displacement. Deep-diving toothed whales are fast, agile swimmers, sized ~3–18 m, and therefore are larger than terrestrial top predators. A larger body volume enables higher relative oxygen stores and resilience to temperature gradients—larger animals can dive deeper, for longer (Kooyman 2009). In the cold deep sea, the homeothermic predators can maintain endurance and fast swimming, providing significant advantage over their poikilothermic prey. These physical and physiological advantages do come at high metabolic costs, demanding many, or large prey (Kooyman 2009). Most deep-diving toothed whale species lack functional teeth for feeding and likely ingest complete prey through suction. This puts an upper limit on prey size, exemplified by individuals dying following ingestion of large cephalopods (MacLeod et al. 2006; Fernández et al. 2017). With some exceptions, toothed whales feed on small prey, 1–5% of their own length, thus depending on the presence of numerous prey (MacLeod et al. 2006). When a toothed whale searches for and approaches a squid, the interaction between predator and prey takes different shape as a function of distance and mutual capability of detection (Fig. 2). The primary anti-predatory behaviors evolved in cephalopods against visually hunting fish (Jaitly et al. 2022) do not suffice for pelagic deep-sea squids eluding echolocating toothed whales. The main sensory systems employed by toothed whales and squids for remote detection, respectively, biosonar and vision, provide a strong advantage for the predatory toothed whale. Their long-range acoustic detection of squids is up to an order of magnitude higher than the presumed maximum visual detection range (e.g., disturbances in the bioluminescent field) of giant squid, which have the largest eyes of all cephalopods (Nilsson et al. 2012). Hence, cephalopods are likely under strong selective pressure to avoid remote acoustic detection. Hypothesis 1.Prey modulate body posture to reduce remote detection. Cephalopods may be able to reduce the possibility of remote detection by minimizing their acoustic cross-section (reflective surface). Similar to fish, many deep-sea squids, have elongated body shapes (Boyle and Rodhouse 2005; Jereb and Roper 2010) (Fig. 1). While this shape reduces drag, it also results in a small visual silhouette when animals position themselves vertically in the water column, a cryptic position for visual predators that come from above or below (e.g., Miller et al. 2014). At the same time, it may be a yet unrecognized defense mechanism in cephalopods against the probability for remote detection by a foraging whale descending from the surface. A vertical position also reduces the acoustic cross-section (detectability), and possibly leads predators to underestimate detected prey size. The role of deep-sea squid body posture in reducing remote acoustic detection during the search phase could be tested using an acoustic model estimating squid detectability (i.e., reflecting signal strength) by whale echolocation under varying squid acoustic cross sections and geometry of predator or prey. Given the typically steep dive descents of the acoustic predators, we predict detectability to be significantly reduced in oblique vs. horizontally-oriented squids, when ensonified remotely from above. Hypothesis 2.Prey downregulate density to reduce remote detection. While some cephalopods occur in aggregations (e.g., ommastrephids, some species in the deep scattering layer; Benoit-Bird et al. 2017), or as mating pairs (Hoving and Vecchione 2012), surprisingly, the vast majority of deep-sea cephalopods are observed as single individuals (Hoving et al. 2012; Vecchione 2019). Biologging records of toothed whale hunting behavior also support non schooling prey. Prey is typically captured during a transitory movement, with capture attempts spaced apart in time and space while the predator moves through its prospect foraging zone. With few exceptions, there is no indication of circling or other movements indicative of backtracking the same area, to target a school (e.g., Fais et al. 2015; Aguilar de Soto et al. 2020). Limited food availability may be an explanation for low prey densities in the deep sea. Single, non schooling individuals, however, are unexpected in a featureless environment, given the apparent evolutionary advantage of group-formation across terrestrial and marine prey taxa, in predator defense (e.g., flocks, schools and herds) (Krause and Ruxton 2002). However, schooling may only be an effective strategy against visual, but not acoustic marine predators. Toothed whale foraging decisions are likely strongly driven by prey density, and particularly so as the predators rely on numerous, relatively small prey (MacLeod et al. 2006). Schooling will result in enhanced local density and likely enhanced long-range detectability. The high plasticity of the echolocation system allows for high-resolution tracking of single targets (Jensen et al. 2018). Hence, schooling could prove detrimental for the pelagic cephalopods. Instead, dispersed individuals may remain below the density threshold and escape pursuit. In this light, it becomes apparent that mating in deep-sea cephalopods might be dangerous, possibly explaining brief, nonselective mating behavior in some (Hoving et al. 2012) and sperm storage in most deep-sea squids (Hoving et al. 2012; Hoving and Vecchione 2012; Vecchione 2019). Increased acoustic backscatter from the benthos, limiting the detection by acoustic predators, may have selected for close occurrence and mating near the seafloor (e.g., Pholidoteuthis adami) (Hoving and Vecchione 2012). A disadvantage of occurring closer to the seafloor is that escape directions are reduced. We propose that the evolution of long-range acoustic predators shifted predator–prey trade-offs in the deep sea. Schooling posed increased risk to squids, resulting in common occurrence of single individuals. Whether dispersal vs. schooling reduces acoustic detection can be assessed through modeling the acoustic detectability of remote dispersed vs. schooling individuals. Cephalopod schooling strategies, that is, whether schooling is modulated as a function of acoustic predator presence, can be tested in field experiments and observations that consider squid schooling behavior preceding known toothed whale predatory interactions. Echo sounders placed close to the prey field, can simultaneously record squids and their cetacean predators, and identify predatory interactions (e.g., Urmy and Benoit-Bird 2021). Combining echo sounders with hydrophones will allow the analysis of schooling behavior during predator presence and absence and also during predator search phases with and without ensuing approach and pursuit. Finally, this approach allows analysis of schooling behavior under high vs. low predation pressure. We predict that, if squid dispersal is driven by predation (opposed to environmental drivers), prior to being located, most deep-sea squids will be dispersed (non schooling), and respond to a first cue of an approaching predator presence by further dispersion. We also expect a positive relation between the local level of acoustic predation pressure and the degree of cephalopod dispersion. Hypothesis 3.Predators synchronize and separate to enhance detection of dispersed prey. If deep-sea cephalopods do not school, how do their mammalian predators maintain efficient foraging on small, remote, and dispersed prey? Deep-diving toothed whales are typically social (24 out of ~26 species), living in cohesive groups. Near-surface spatial proximity is broken, however, during foraging (e.g., Visser et al. 2014 for pilot whales, Globicephala macrorhynchus)—contrasting the adaptive coordinated hunting of social shallow-diving toothed whales (e.g., Pitman and Durban 2012 for killer whales, Orcinus orca). For the nine species of deep-diving toothed whales for which foraging strategy has been described, tightly spaced social groups at the surface will spread out over hundreds of meters and hunt synchronously, but individually, at depth. This becomes apparent from (1) the significant increase in inter-individual distance either at surface, or during the dive descent (e.g., Whitehead 1989; Aguilar de Soto et al. 2020) and (2) from the echolocation signals and movement patterns during foraging dives. These show individual searching and hunting patterns (while other foraging group members can be heard), and no evidence of, for example, joint corralling of prey (e.g., Fais et al. 2015 for sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus; Aguilar de Soto et al. 2020 for beaked whales). Synchronization of the foraging effort between group members, recorded across the different deep-diving toothed whale genera, suggests that this is an adaptive strategy that may facilitate detection of prey. This may be achieved through information sharing (reviewed by Hansen et al. 2023), and possibly by cover reduction of disturbed cephalopods through behavioral response to another detected predator. Particulate feeding on small prey is a rare foraging strategy in vertebrate social foragers, which typically hunt on individual large, or small schooling prey (Hansen et al. 2023). The ratio of predator : prey size predicts the strategy of herding or condensing of prey for deep-diving toothed whales, as observed for, for example, herring-feeding killer whales (Hansen et al. 2023). Instead, we propose that a non schooling predator response in cephalopods leads social toothed whales to adopt synchronized, yet individual hunting. We predict that coordinated searching and social information transfer between individual predators will increase the energetic efficiency of hunting non schooling deep-sea prey. This can be tested using high-resolution, multisensor tags, or moorings equipped with echo sounders and multihydrophone arrays, which track the positions, acoustic behavior, number of nearby conspecifics and foraging performance of multiple foraging group members (Aguilar de Soto et al. 2020; Jang et al. 2023), in relation to the prey field (Chevallay et al. 2023). We predict that foraging return is higher in individuals that forage in spatiotemporal synchrony than in individuals foraging alone. If foraging-decisions are not socially enhanced, but driven primarily by environmental factors, foraging return will be independent of group size, or reduced, due to competition. Hypothesis 4.Prey have limited escape-potential when acoustic predator closes in for capture. If the predators coordinate their search efforts to overcome cephalopod crypsis, how do cephalopods avoid predation? Given their investment in large, complex eyes, at moderate range (tens of meters) perhaps there is still an option for eluding detection or pursuit, for example, by sensing disturbed conspecifics, adapting orientation, or by exiting the acoustic beam (Fig. 2). However, this may render the individual cephalopod vulnerable for detection by other, nearby-hunting whales. In final pursuit, whales strongly accelerate their biosonar repetition rate and widen their echolocation beam, enabling tracking of rapidly moving nearby targets (Jensen et al. 2018). Overall high apparent capture rates (~90%), short sprints and onsets of final approach at only 1–2 predator body lengths (Fais et al. 2015; Tønnesen et al. 2020; Visser et al. 2022), suggest that, once pursued, prey has little chance of escape. Testing this hypothesis requires the documentation of the exact interaction between cephalopod and toothed whale just before capture. To date, these interactions remain unobserved. Escape responses can be studied using whale-mimicking robotics programmed to identify, approach, and follow mesopelagic squids, as has been done for hydromedusae (Yoerger et al. 2018). The predatory interaction and potential for escape (or predator success rate), can be studied using high-resolution, multisensor tags which record predator foraging behavior and success, together with the prey field (Chevallay et al. 2023) and squid behavior while under attack (Aoki et al. 2015). We expect that escape responses include dynamic swimming, inking and bioluminescent displays and that these responses are generally not successful to avoid the acoustic predator. The whale-cephalopod system involves interaction between two cognitively advanced animal groups, characterized by apparently strong sensory and physiological advantages for the mammalian predator. Under the unique conditions of the deep ocean environment, the selective pressures that have shaped their adaptive traits differentiate from those in other, well-studied habitats. Specifically, deep-sea cephalopods hunted by whales cannot rely on physical protection or agility and may not find safety in numbers, by schooling. Cephalopod principal ""dis-armament"" in the foraging interaction with acoustic predators can explain their ""live fast die young"" strategy (semelparity), highly abundant populations (r-selection), sometimes rapid, nonselective mating behavior, and propensity to seek refuge at large depths (ontogenetic migration). These traits may now allow cephalopods to become increasingly successful in changing oceans with overexploited finfish stocks and rapid warming (Doubleday et al. 2016). Whether in response to, or driving whale exceptional sensory capacity and uncommon social foraging strategies, it exemplifies that deep-sea predatory interactions differ from those in better known systems, such as shallow-water and terrestrial systems, and require direct observation to understand their dynamics. We take a critical step in our understanding of deep-sea ecosystem dynamics through identification of predation by whales as a key driver of the life history patterns and density distribution of the abundant and diverse deep-sea cephalopods and advocate a research strategy that considers the selective pressures of the habitat and the well-developed senses of the species.

https://doi.org/10.33730/2310-4678.4.2023.292721,THE ROLE OF SNAKE VENOM IN THE BIOTIC INTERACTION,"It is highlighted the ecological significance of biotic interactions. Biotic relationships can be intra- or interspecific, positive or negative and cover a wide range of interactions, including predation, commensalism, mutualism, competition and parasitism. It is indicated that snake venoms, which are the best studied, attract the greatest attention of researchers. The role of predators in the formation of the structure and functioning of ecosystems is analyzed. It has been established that the predator–prey ecological interaction causes mutual physiological, morphological and behavioral adaptations at the individual, intra- and inter-species levels. It is noted that toxins are important adaptation that arose due to evolution. Representatives of venomous animals are present in every ecosystem, more than 250,000 species of animals use their venom for predation, as well as for defense and survival. Іnformation about the types of poisonous and venomous animals is summarized in the article. The composition of animal venoms and the pathological consequences of their influence are presented. It is noted that the lost of habitats, climate change and biological invasions pose a threat to ecological processes that are associated with the interaction between species. The importance of snakes for ecosystems, their significance for trophic network and regulating pests is highlighted. It was found that from an ecological point of view, snake venom is an important functional trait that mediates biotic interaction between several organisms.

https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.13746,Competitive interactions affect introgression and population viability amidst maladaptive hybridization,"The deliberate release of captive-bred individuals, the accidental escape of domesticated strains, or the invasion of closely related conspecifics into wild populations can all lead to introgressive hybridization, which poses a challenge for conservation and wildlife management. Rates of introgression and the magnitude of associated demographic impacts vary widely across ecological contexts. However, the reasons for this variation remain poorly understood. One rarely considered phenomenon in this context is soft selection, wherein relative trait values determine success in intraspecific competition for a limiting resource. Here we develop an eco-genetic model explicitly focussed on understanding the influence of such competitive interactions on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of wild populations experiencing an influx of foreign/domesticated individuals. The model is applicable to any taxon that experiences natural or human-mediated inputs of locally maladapted genotypes ('intrusion'), in addition to phenotype-dependent competition for a limiting resource (e.g. breeding sites, feeding territories). The effects of both acute and chronic intrusion depended strongly on the relative competitiveness of intruders versus locals. When intruders were competitively inferior, density-dependent regulation limited their reproductive success (ability to compete for limited spawning sites), which prevented strong introgression or population declines from occurring. In contrast, when intruders were competitively superior, this amplified introgression and led to increased maladaptation of the admixed population. This had negative consequences for population size and population viability. The results were sensitive to the intrusion level, the magnitude of reproductive excess, trait heritability and the extent to which intruders were maladapted relative to locals. Our findings draw attention to under-appreciated interactions between phenotype-dependent competitive interactions and maladaptive hybridization, which may be critical to determining the impact captive breeding programmes and domesticated escapees can have on otherwise self-sustaining wild populations.",https://openalex.org/W4400258445,26d2ebe06be830fb622c83a09b21bef76271feae,0,True,0.988706111907959,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/rec.14354,The role of habitat in predator–prey dynamics with applications to restoration,"Habitat is a powerful force in ecosystems, and the quantity and quality of habitat can shape ecosystem structure and function. Among the many important roles that habitat plays is as a mediator of ecological interactions, including predator–prey dynamics. In the context of ecosystem restoration, there is great potential to better understand how predator–prey dynamics are influenced by habitat and whether this has implications for how ecosystems are managed. We consider the ways in which habitat serves as an important mediator of interactions between predators and their prey and present four ways in which habitat acts as an intermediary that enhances or diminishes this relationship. We found that habitat provides refuge from predators and shapes the physical traits of prey as they use their surroundings to protect themselves. We also discuss how habitat creates physical resistance and sets the cost of predation for predators and how habitat facilitates apparent competition within a community context. These roles of habitat are well established in ecology, but we believe they are underdeveloped from an applied perspective. We conclude that habitat must be appropriately considered in the context of how it mediates predation. Given the ways that habitat influences predation, restoration efforts should consider if and how physical measures may positively or negatively affect species interactions and whether this could lead to success or failure of overall programs.",https://openalex.org/W4406755848,a24cbe048fd85dc274ed701906e7687fdce86e28,0,True,0.989788293838501,0
https://doi.org/10.3732/ajb.90.6.960,Plant ecology textbooks: a new contender,"In their new text, The Ecology of Plants, Gurevitch et al. have produced a unique and valuable resource for plant ecologists. As a tool for teaching, this book is an improvement over existing plant ecology texts, due to its comprehensive scope, its rich illustration, and the level at which material is presented. The Ecology of Plants covers ecophysiology, soils, evolution, population biology, life history, community structure and dynamics, ecosystems, landscapes, climate, biomes, paleoecology, and global change. As we present in detail below, the primary weakness of the text is its organization. However, because of its strengths, this text is in use at the University of Montana as we write and will be used by some or all of us in the future. Below we have organized our detailed comments and opinion on The Ecology of Plants by the order of the general sections used by the authors. Gurevitch et al. begin with a short chapter on ecology as a science. This section will be appreciated by those teaching at the undergraduate level in particular. The presentation is clear, the authors do not fall into the trap of Popperian dogmatism, nor do they simply insist that ecology is more than environmentalism. Instead, we are provided with a broad perspective on scientific epistemology, the value of experimentation, and a brief history of ecology. This is a nice opening to the section that follows, although the leap from Darwin and Haeckel to John Harper left some of us wondering where Warming, Schimper, Clements, and Gleason had been placed. We found Clements and Gleason in wonderful detail in Chapter 12. The first meaty section is the unit titled “The Individual and its Environment.” This section deals with aspects of plant physiological ecology and is divided into chapters on light and photosynthesis, water relations and energy balance, and soils, mineral nutrition, and belowground interactions. Within each chapter, the authors chose a traditional descriptive approach in which a great deal of useful information is provided. However, we thought that a more contemporary approach, perhaps emphasizing how plant physiological responses under different environments relate to overall plant strategies within population, community, and ecosystem contexts might be more beneficial for students of plant ecology. Overall, there is a lack of conceptual integration in this section of the book, and the information does not always follow the most logical structure. There is also little emphasis on the integration of responses at different time (from short-term to evolutionary responses) and spatial scales (from cells to entire plant responses). The student ends up with an excellent source of ecophysiological information, but little appreciation that plants deal with numerous physiological and biophysical constraints that impose important trade-offs that prevent plants from excelling in each of their main functional outcomes (e.g., growth, stress tolerance, defense against consumers, reproduction). There is little development in this unit of the historical progression of the field, and there is insufficient reference to classical work. Given the traditional approach taken by the authors in Part I, it is surprising that there is no stand-alone treatment of plant responses to temperature (there's a little in Chapter 22). After all, temperature and water availability are the two most influential factors on productivity and distribution. While the authors include an energy balance section within the water relations chapter, there is no mention of responses to low and high temperature. We thought that an initial section on energy would have provided a stronger general framework for the following sections on carbon, water, and nutrient relations. This organization would also emphasize the role of plants as primary drivers of energy flow within ecosystems and provide a clear tie to Parts IV and V. Chapter 2, “Photosynthesis and the Light Environment,” does not emphasize the concept that assimilated carbon is partitioned into many competing functions and that overall carbon allocation strategies have important consequences on productivity, growth rates, reproductive potential, stress tolerance, and competitive interactions. While not crucial, this omission is likely to cause physiology-challenged ecologists a little reorganizational heartburn. Without reorganization, students may not fully appreciate that overall biomass accumulation may be substantially limited by respiration costs, which in turn are regulated by growth and allocation strategies as well as the environment (e.g., temperature). A more comprehensive chapter on carbon relations would provide this perspective. As it is, the chapter quickly moves to explanations of the light and dark reactions of photosynthesis without providing an overall conceptual overview of the function of these two important phases and their interdependence from the onset. While there is substantial detail on light harvesting, the conceptual understanding of how solar energy is used to synthesize ATP in the chloroplast is not clear (Fig. 2.2 may be misleading). The dark reactions are described in one short paragraph with no mention on how the products of the light reactions are used in the dark reactions. There is no mention at this point that actual carbon “fixation” and reduction occur during this phase. This is unfortunate as it is this initial reduction by plants that allows energy transfer through trophic levels within ecosystems. The dual affinity of rubisco to CO2 and O2 and the consequent photorespiratory cycle are not brought up until the discussion on photosynthetic pathways. Adding to the organizational confusion, the chapter moves into a discussion of the effects of light and carbon uptake limitations prior to a more in-depth description of the dark reactions; these are included in an explanation of the different photosynthetic pathways. The chapter includes strong sections on evolutionary aspects of photosynthetic pathways, geographic distribution, habitat preferences, and adaptations to the light environment. However, the last section should be titled “Plant Responses” because it includes both adaptation and acclimation. The information is excellent, but we believe the chapter would be improved if the light and dark reactions in C3 plants were presented in sufficient conceptual detail first, and afterwards the chapter proceeded to the “problem” of rubisco and photorespiration in C3 plants and the evolution of alternative photosynthetic pathways with consequent costs and benefits. With this organization, the progression to the responses of plants with different pathways to light, water, and temperature, the relationship of pathways to habitat preference and geographic distribution, and general ecological strategies would flow naturally. Links between this chapter and others could be made by emphasizing the links between photosynthetic traits and plant life history traits (e.g., fast- vs. slow-growing plants, early vs. late successional species). The chapter on water relations suffers from the same lack of integration and cohesive structure. The abundant information is often scattered (e.g., responses to flooding or drought) or missing all together (e.g., there is no mention of the concept of water-use efficiency or the importance of xylem structure in water relations). Students and instructors without strong ecophysiological backgrounds would benefit from a simple discussion of why plants lose so much water, the main compartments that water moves through in the plant (introducing here the concept of the relative role of these compartments to maintain a functional homeostasis with respect to water transport), and then a clear explanation of water potential as the driving force for water movement. In the discussion of water potential the authors make a minor but common mistake by portraying matric potential as an independent component of the total water potential. Matric potential is actually a combination of osmotic and hydrostatic pressures and should be omitted from the equation. A more linear explanation of the water potential components along the overall plant–atmosphere continuum could logically lead to an explanation of why xylem water potential is such a good indicator of overall plant water status and a variable commonly measured by plant ecologists. (Fig. 4.10 in the soil chapter would be much more relevant here.) The sections on strategies for coping with water availability are quite unorganized. The student should be provided with a clearer understanding that plants exhibit a variety of phenological, structural, anatomical, and physiological responses to variation in water availability and that these responses may operate at different times (short-term to evolutionary time scales) and spatial scales (from cells to entire plants). The “strategies” employed by plants to cope with water stress are presented more as a list and could have been divided into groups—for example, species that “avoid” any activity during water stress (drought escape) vs. plants that remain more or less active during drought (drought resistance). Perhaps it is reasonable for a general text on plant ecology to omit some important strategies for drought resistance, but increased water transport and storage tissues in woody plants and increased resistance to xylem cavitation are missing and hydraulic lift (which should probably be generalized to “hydraulic redistribution”) by roots comes later in the soil chapter. Of the three chapters in Part I, the chapter on soil and mineral nutrition is the most deficient. The chapter starts with a great deal of descriptive detail on soil composition and structure without an initial discussion of why these details are important to plants. There is no emphasis on the importance of plant mineral nutrition or its effect on functional strategies and ecosystem properties. While the chapter goes into great detail on soil properties it does not explore in a logical order the many strategies plants employ to deal with limiting nutrients (mycorrhizae and nitrogen fixation are in independent sections) and the trade-offs associated with these strategies. Not including these potential trade-offs is not crucial, but they would offer a great opportunity to link this chapter to the carbon and water relations chapters and to subsequent chapters on ecological strategies and plant–animal interactions. The chapter omits fundamental concepts such as nutrient-use efficiency, nutrient residence time (or life span), nutrient recycling, and the relationship of these traits to growth forms (e.g., a distinction between evergreen and deciduous species, etc.). There is little or no emphasis on how mineral nutrition feeds back to soil properties (including microbes) and the implications for community and ecosystem dynamics. In much the same way as we would like to see for the water relations chapter, why not start with an exploration of why mineral nutrients are needed for plant growth and how soil properties affect nutrient availability and end with a clear overview of how plants respond to variation in soil fertility and physical characteristics? Like much of the rest of the text, the population biology section (Chapters 7–9, or 5–9 if you include the two chapters on evolution) is comprehensive, but the organization is somewhat obscure. The section begins with a general discussion of evolutionary processes (Chapters 5 and 6), followed by population growth (Chapter 7), individual growth (Chapter 8), and life history theory (Chapter 9). We agreed that for teaching plant ecology, we would almost certainly present the material in a different order than in the text—at a minimum, by putting individual growth before population growth and after evolution, which has traditionally been approached by plant ecologists from an individual perspective (for example, estimating fitness from individual survival and fecundity, rather than by projecting genotype-specific lambdas). Yet Gurevitch et al. should be commended for including chapters on evolutionary processes in their book, as these important topics are missing from many plant ecology texts. Indeed, with the growing interest among ecologists in rapid evolution and the role of evolutionary processes in plant invasions, there is ample scope for even broader coverage and integration of ecology with evolution in textbooks. The material covered in the subsequent chapters on population biology was also presented in a somewhat haphazard manner. For example, the chapter on population growth only briefly mentions dispersal and density dependence, and almost entirely focuses on age- or stage-structured transition matrices, with an extensive discussion of matrix modeling methods, including calculation of sensitivity, elasticity, reproductive value, as well as methods for incorporating environmental stochasticity. In our experience, undergraduates would benefit from a more complete discussion of basic (i.e., unstructured) population models before moving so quickly into a detailed discussion of matrix projections. Gurevitch et al.'s emphasis may well reflect the state of the art in plant demography, but our sense is that the groundwork for this material isn't adequate. For example, there is only a brief discussion of life tables, but no real discussion of the elements of a life table or different approaches to collecting data for life tables (i.e., cohort, partial cohort, or static analyses), or how one integrates life table statistics into projection matrices. Although the authors cite a few alternative methods to transition matrices, alternative mechanisms of population growth are scattered among other chapters. For example, clonal spread is discussed in detail in Chapter 8, without reference to methods for inferring population growth and spread from clonal tillering, which is, in our opinion, an approach much more naturally suited to rhizomatous herbaceous perennials than transition matrices. Density-dependent population growth models are presented in the context of r vs. K selection in Chapter 9, but only discussed qualitatively in the population growth chapter. Metapopulation models and source–sink dynamics appear in Chapter 17 (landscape ecology), creating the impression that spatial dynamics and population dynamics describe different processes, rather than acting as ends of a continuum of population structures. Interspecific competition is presented in Chapter 10, but the relationship to density-dependent population growth is not clear from the text alone; it would need to be made by a course instructor. Similarly, Chapter 8 combines basic plant morphology; a generalized life cycle; clonal growth, foraging, and reproduction (awkwardly split into two disjunct sections); a large section on pollination biology; and a discussion of seed dispersal and seed banks. There is no real synthesis of the different methods; e.g., comparison of “dispersal” by branching, ramets, pollen, or seeds. Neither is it clear why dispersal belongs with individual growth, rather than population growth. In the discussion of clonal growth, as in other places throughout the book, those whom we perceive as movers and shakers in the field (de Kroon and van Groenendael [1997], Cain [1994], and Alpert [1991], for example) were not mentioned. This chapter would have been better split into three; one dealing with modularity and clonal growth, the second discussing reproduction, pollination ecology, and pollination syndromes, and the third discussing frugivory, seed dispersal, and seed predation. We found the section on the ecology of fruits and seeds in Chapter 8 particularly frustrating, as the coverage of frugivory, seed dispersal and predation, and seed dormancy was rudimentary at best, although granivory is covered in more detail in Chapter 11. The chapter on life history (Chapter 9) includes a general discussion of life history strategies (annual vs. perennial; semelparous vs. iteroparous; seed dormancy and germination requirements), seed size vs. seed number trade-offs, phenology, and a brief section on using demographic models to quantify life history trade-offs. The demography section is a bit repetitive with Chapter 7; for example, the justification for why geometric mean population growth is the appropriate measure of fitness and long-term population growth is given in both, though in slightly different words. We believe that these sections would also be greatly improved by tighter links among chapters; for example it is almost—but not quite—clear that matrix models are central to life history theory because genotype-specific population growth rates are estimates of fitness. A brief appendix is presented to discuss simple statistics, with description of simple statistics like mean and variance, and verbal explanations of statistical tests and P values. The combination of the very basic and general appendix with the detailed section on matrix calculations in Chapter 7 seems targeted to different audiences. We were impressed by the effort to explain to readers how to do calculations for population models; it can be frustrating when texts mention that models exist and provide nifty results, but do not explain relevant calculations. Criticisms stated, we agree that The Ecology of Plants is the text we would choose if population biology was the emphasis in an ecology course. As for other sections, our opinion was swayed by the impressive breadth of engaging material. Following Part III, “From Populations to Communities,” the text springs immediately into competition. The community context comes in Chapter 12 in a rather traditional discussion of Clements and Gleason. The chapter on competition is strong, but is missing or only perfunctorily addresses current advances in indirect interactions, allelopathy, and, to the chagrin of at least one of our reviewing crew, facilitation. Competitive hierarchies are mentioned, but the fascinating implications of nontransitive competitive webs (indirect interactions among competitors á la Thomas Miller [1994] and Jonathan Levine [1999] are not explored). One of us thought that this was the most serious oversight in the text. Positive interactions among plants (Callaway, 1995) are mentioned in a later chapter in the obligatory discussion of the mechanisms driving succession, but are otherwise ignored. Allelopathy is written off in the standard manner of the 1980s with the added twist of misinterpreting a recent paper written by one of our review group (Callaway and Aschehoug, 2000). For a general text, the sections on modeling competition are clearly written and nicely comparative, and the section on competition along abiotic gradients is up to date and excellent. This chapter may be improved moderately by incorporating classic statements by John Harper (1961) on distinguishing competition for resources from other forms of interference. Herbivory and pathogens are treated in the same chapter, appropriately in our opinion, and this chapter includes a short but highly effective consideration of biological control of exotic plants by insects, but with no mention of pathogens as biocontrols. The subsections in the chapter “Effects of Herbivory on the Community Level” begin with the consequences of herbivore behavior, move smartly through subsections on introduced and native herbivores and on to a too-small portion of “generality.” One glaring hole in this section is the omission of a discussion on McNaughton's (1983) classic work in Africa and on Richard Root's (1996) work on the community impacts of herbivores feeding on goldenrod. However, the section on plant defenses is top-notch and thorough, although a clear treatment of the controversy on the costs of defense would have rounded this section out and possibly provided a tie to earlier chapters on carbon allocation. Following this are two pages on “evolutionary consequences” of herbivory that are not connected in any way to communities. Ecology teachers beware; if your goal is a clear organizational picture of plant ecology for relatively naive students, you will have to reorganize. The pathogen section is a quick mention of some cool ecological tidbits, but is not tied to the previous text on herbivory at all. Chapter 12, on community properties, comes without apology or comment after the chapters on competition and consumers. We think that this organizational strategy could have worked, but it would have taken some clear explanation of how the stuff just digested on interactions leads in some way to the properties of communities. One approach to bridging chapters on competition and herbivory to the community properties material might have been to include a chapter explicitly dealing with food webs. Rich topics such as trophic cascades, keystone species (Power et al., 1996), subsidies, and subsidized food webs are mostly ignored in The Ecology of Plants, and inclusion of these topics would have made for engaging reading. In this section the enormous body of work describing plant communities is limited to species richness, diversity, dominance, and basic sampling strategies—multivariate ordination and classification come four chapters later in an entirely different section, a chapter titled “Communities in Landscapes” in Part IV, “From Ecosystems to Landscapes.” Chapter 13, on succession, is standard but strong. Students will come away with a clear understanding of succession and why it is important to plant communities. Missing however, is any mention of cyclic or shifting mosaic dynamics, and the subsection on primary section follows sub-subsections on volcanoes, fire, colonization, and others, but no parallel subsection on secondary succession. This is also one of the only chapters that simply does not include enough current literature on succession. Chapter 14 is a peach, and here Gurevitch et al. have made a significant stride in teaching ecology. By thoughtfully probing dominance, abundance, and rarity, and including theory developed by Deborah Goldberg and colleagues, David Tilman, MacArthurian distribution curves, and niche theory, this chapter in The Ecology of Plants will provide advanced students and most professors with stimulating thoughts and new directions. These concepts are blended smoothly with a following section on invasives that will no doubt help make the material more relevant to undergraduates. In our opinion, however, the treatment of invasives could have been bolstered by both a clear explanation of the natural enemies hypothesis as the primary hypothesis for invasive success and a broader inclusion of the processes driving invasion such as presented by Richard Mack and colleagues (2000). More generally, inclusion of neutral community theory such as that promoted by Steven Hubbell (2001) would have fit well in the discussion of abundance and dominance. The Ecology of Plants leaves communities and proceeds to ecosystems cleanly. “Processes” in Chapter 15 are nutrient cycling, carbon flow, and productivity, but nowhere is the movement of energy explicitly and clearly explained as a crucial ecosystem process. This chapter includes two very nice subsections on nitrogen and phosphorus in ecosystems, interrupted oddly by an equivalent subsection titled “Ecosystem Nutrient Cycling and Plant Diversity,” after which puzzled readers will find processes described for other elements. A simple move of the diversity section to the end would solve the problem. Chapter 16 probably comprises the most unusual large-scale organizational choice of all. We could find no connection between “communities in landscapes” and ecosystems. On the other hand, multivariate ordination is just skipped by many instructors, and this may be easier to do when it is hiding in an ecosystems unit. This said, The Ecology of Plants deals with the messy issues of ordination and classification quite nicely. Direct and indirect ordination are clearly contrasted, several modern techniques are presented, and this is all followed by a connection with remote sensing. This chapter is followed by a nice chapter on landscape ecology, which combines the explanation of remote techniques with island biogeography and metapopulations theory. The latter two bodies of theory link perfectly, but these were not tied to remote landscape analysis. Part V, “Global Patterns and Processes,” is one of the best. Beginning with a superb unit on basic global climate that should be read just for fun, the transition to biome physiognomy in the last sections and the following chapter (Chapter 19) is smooth. Chapter 20 on regional and global diversity is a unique and brilliant follow-up to the biome chapters, the ideas are stimulating, and the way that both old and new material are integrated ought to change some syllabi. Although none of the review team can claim paleological expertise, this short but nicely placed chapter is almost as good a read as the unit on global climate. Our one recommendation is that this chapter could be better connected with the section on communities. Global change issues such as global warming, nitrogen deposition, invasive species, and habitat fragmentation are presented in well-organized detail in the concluding chapter of The Ecology of Plants. These topics are increasingly an important component of ecology that have traditionally been given short shrift in texts. Global warming is clearly tied to Chapter 2 on carbon uptake and Chapter 15 on the carbon cycle and productivity. Increasing atmospheric CO2 is explained, and these effects on plants are separated clearly from the cascading effects of CO2 on temperature and the effects of temperature on plants. The fluxes in the carbon cycle figure correspond reasonably well with those in Houghton et al. (1995); however, the section would be improved by a simple layman's explanation of how greenhouse molecules comprising a tiny fraction of the atmosphere can force global warming. We were told to go to Chapter 2 for comments on the effects of CO2 on temperature, but this didn't help much. We would have loved to have seen the Croll-Milancovič theory for long-term climate change integrated with their presentation of the greenhouse-gas forcing theory for global warming. To one of us, Chapter 22 did not express reasonable (read “any”) skepticism for the predictive global change scenarios presented and took on a decidedly biased political tone when discussing fossil fuel combustion. However, these opinions should not be taken as reasons to dismiss a very good final chapter in an excellent Part V. Our complaints about the organization of The Ecology of Plants should not be taken as a dismissal of the book as a high-quality text. On the contrary, even with its organizational shortcomings, this book provides the most comprehensive, well-integrated, and accessible treatment of plant ecology available and is perfectly suited for undergraduate teaching. Gurevitch et al. use pictures, graphs, and diagrams liberally. They use box insets frequently and effectively. A wonderful aspect of the book is the sprinkling of names and pictures of many ecologists that are cited in the text. All of these features make for an engaging text that should provide stimulating reading for undergraduates and a useful reference for more advanced students.",https://openalex.org/W2128567102,6d5a19578a6d9b11ff00738f1b00e641248895ae,0,True,0.9817138910293579,0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013245,Evolution of foraging behaviour induces variable complexity-stability relationships in mutualist-exploiter-predator communities,"Early ecological theory predicts that complex ecological networks are unstable and are unlikely to persist, despite many empirical studies of such complexity in nature. This inconsistency has fascinated ecologists for decades. To resolve the complexity-stability debate, coupling population dynamics and trait dynamics is considered to be an important way to understand the long-term stability of ecological community assemblages. However, we still do not know how eco-evolutionary feedbacks affect the relationship between complexity and stability in ecologically realistic networks with both antagonistic and mutualistic interactions. Here, we explored an adaptive network model to evaluate how the evolution of foraging preference to determine the relationship between network complexity (i.e., connectance) and stability (i.e., community persistence at steady state) in mutualist-exploiter-predator communities (MEST). Our theoretical results showed: (i) adaptive foraging of the top predator contributes to the stability of mutualism and intermediate intensity of foraging adaptations can lead to chaotic dynamics in a four-species MEST community; (ii) the complexity-stability relationship may show positive monotonic, negative monotonic, peaked and double-peaked patterns in general MEST communities, while the double-peaked pattern is only obtained when both the adaptation intensity and interspecific competition are high. Furthermore, model predictions may be consistent with both the negative monotonic pattern revealed in freshwater communities and the peaked pattern revealed in marine communities. Finally, we infer that foraging adaptations of the top predator may alter positive or/and negative feedback loops (trait-mediated indirect effects) to affect the stability of general MEST communities. Our adaptive network framework may provide an effective way to address the complexity-stability debate in real ecosystems.",https://openalex.org/W4412124513,0e76d546d355fe15e230cae355a0ac49bc386933,0,True,0.9951774477958679,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.14451,Fitness differences override variation‐dependent coexistence mechanisms in California grasslands,"Abstract While most studies of species coexistence focus on the mechanisms that maintain coexistence, it is equally important to understand the mechanisms that structure failed coexistence. For example, California annual grasslands are heavily invaded ecosystems, where non‐native annuals have largely dominated and replaced native communities. These systems are also highly variable, with a high degree of rainfall seasonality and interannual rainfall variability—a quality implicated in the coexistence of functionally distinct species. Yet, despite the apparent strength of this variation, coexistence between native and non‐native annuals in this system has faltered. To test how variation‐dependent coexistence mechanisms modulate failed coexistence, we implemented a competition experiment between two previously common native forbs and three now‐dominant non‐native annual grasses spanning a conservative‐acquisitive range of traits. We grew individuals from each species under varying densities of all other species as competitors, under either wetter or drier early season rainfall treatments. Using subsequent seed production, we parameterized competition models, assessed the potential for coexistence among species pairs and quantified the relative influence of variation‐dependent coexistence mechanisms. As expected, we found little potential for coexistence. Competition was dominated by the non‐native grass Avena fatua, while native forbs were unable to invade non‐native grasses. Mutual competitive exclusion was common across almost all species and often contingent on rainfall, suggesting rainfall‐mediated priority effects. Among variation‐dependent mechanisms, the temporal storage effect had a moderate stabilizing effect for four of five species when averaged across competitors, while relative nonlinearity in competition was largely destabilizing, except for the most conservative non‐native grass, which benefited from a competitive release under dry conditions. Synthesis : Our findings suggest that rainfall variability does little to mitigate the fitness differences that underlie widespread annual grass invasion in California, but that it influences coexistence dynamics among the now‐dominant non‐native grasses.",https://openalex.org/W4404641610,4422a6651fdcc1a5a0eaa332e89cb5dcc948fea7,0,True,0.9939050078392029,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.10596,Selection for domestication favored taxa characterized by fast growth and tolerance of high intraspecific density,"Societal Impact Statement To understand why certain plants have been domesticated into crops, we need to recognize that the environmental conditions plants experience in wild populations are totally different from those of agricultural fields. In this study, we investigated whether the characteristics that promote growth and survival in these different environments may have influenced domestication. Our results revealed that ancestral crops were selected because they developed better than other plants in dense single‐species stands, with selection for increased yield likely occurring after domestication. These insights shed light on the origins of agriculture and offer valuable guidance for future crop breeding efforts. Summary In spite of a large history of research, it is still unclear which functional traits may have mediated plant domestication. Solving this problem requires consideration of the ecological and demographic disparities between natural plant populations and cultivated fields. Since population density tends to be higher in the latter, we hypothesized that traits facilitating growth and survival in dense, monospecific populations might have been relevant for initial domestication. We investigated whether functional traits that respond to population density varied across three different domestication stages: undomesticated crop wild relatives, natural populations of crop progenitors, and landraces. To do this, we compared traits influencing competition (lodging; growth rate), resource acquisition (plant height; total aerial and root biomass) and yield (fruit number) in three annual legume crops—lentil, grasspea, and vetch—grown without resource limitation at three different densities. Our results showed clear differences among species, likely reflective of the distinct uses of the crops and their domestication pathways. Nevertheless, undomesticated relatives consistently differed from crop progenitors and landraces, producing smaller, slower‐growing plants that were more prostrate and allocated less biomass to roots. The effect of selection under domestication on these vegetative traits appeared to be largely negligible. Conversely, landraces produced more fruits. We conclude that early agriculturalists selected for domestication wild legumes that performed well in dense monocultures and were more effective in resource capture. Later domestication and breeding efforts likely had more significant effects on reproductive traits, such as fruit and seed production.",https://openalex.org/W4403550386,90d80a7d98dd5d87d31190acc24a70b49a53f494,0,True,0.980925977230072,0
https://doi.org/10.25932/publishup-47941,Using individual-based modeling to understand grassland diversity and resilience in the Anthropocene,"The world’s grassland systems are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic change. Susceptible to a variety of different stressors, from land-use intensification to climate change, understanding the mechanisms driving the maintenance of these systems’ biodiversity and stability, and how these mechanisms may shift under human-mediated disturbance, is thus critical for successfully navigating the next century. Within this dissertation, I use an individual-based and spatially-explicit model of grassland community assembly (IBC-grass) to examine several processes, thought key to understanding their biodiversity and stability and how it changes under stress. In the first chapter of my thesis, I examine the conditions under which intraspecific trait variation influences the diversity of simulated grassland communities. In the second and third chapters of my thesis, I shift focus towards understanding how belowground herbivores influence the stability of these grassland systems to either a disturbance that results in increased, stochastic, plant mortality, or eutrophication. Intraspecific trait variation (ITV), or variation in trait values between individuals of the same species, is fundamental to the structure of ecological communities. However, because it has historically been difficult to incorporate into theoretical and statistical models, it has remained largely overlooked in community-level analyses. This reality is quickly shifting, however, as a consensus of research suggests that it may compose a sizeable proportion of the total variation within an ecological community and that it may play a critical role in determining if species coexist. Despite this increasing awareness that ITV matters, there is little consensus of the magnitude and direction of its influence. Therefore, to better understand how ITV changes the assembly of grassland communities, in the first chapter of my thesis, I incorporate it into an established, individual-based grassland community model, simulating both pairwise invasion experiments as well as the assembly of communities with varying initial diversities. By varying the amount of ITV in these species’ functional traits, I examine the magnitude and direction of ITV’s influence on pairwise invasibility and community coexistence. During pairwise invasion, ITV enables the weakest species to more frequently invade the competitively superior species, however, this influence does not generally scale to the community level. Indeed, unless the community has low alpha- and beta- diversity, there will be little effect of ITV in bolstering diversity. In these situations, since the trait axis is sparsely filled, the competitively inferior may suffer less competition and therefore ITV may buffer the persistence and abundance of these species for some time. In the second and third chapters of my thesis, I model how one of the most ubiquitous trophic interactions within grasslands, herbivory belowground, influences their diversity and stability. Until recently, the fundamental difficulty in studying a process within the soil has left belowground herbivory “out of sight, out of mind.” This dilemma presents an opportunity for simulation models to explore how this understudied process may alter community dynamics. In the second chapter of my thesis, I implement belowground herbivory – represented by the weekly removal of plant biomass – into IBC-grass. Then, by introducing a pulse disturbance, modelled as the stochastic mortality of some percentage of the plant community, I observe how the presence of belowground herbivores influences the resistance and recovery of Shannon diversity in these communities. I find that high resource, low diversity, communities are significantly more destabilized by the presence of belowground herbivores after disturbance. Depending on the timing of the disturbance and whether the grassland’s seed bank persists for more than one season, the impact of the disturbance – and subsequently the influence of the herbivores – can be greatly reduced. However, because human-mediated eutrophication increases the amount of resources in the soil, thus pressuring grassland systems, our results suggest that the influence of these herbivores may become more important over time. In the third chapter of my thesis, I delve further into understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of belowground herbivores on the diversity of grasslands by replicating an empirical mesocosm experiment that crosses the presence of herbivores above- and below-ground with eutrophication. I show that while aboveground herbivory, as predicted by theory and frequently observed in experiments, mitigates the impact of eutrophication on species diversity, belowground herbivores counterintuitively reduce biodiversity. Indeed, this influence positively interacts with the eutrophication process, amplifying its negative impact on diversity. I discovered the mechanism underlying this surprising pattern to be that, as the herbivores consume roots, they increase the proportion of root resources to root biomass. Because root competition is often symmetric, herbivory fails to mitigate any asymmetries in the plants’ competitive dynamics. However, since the remaining roots have more abundant access to resources, the plants’ competition shifts aboveground, towards asymmetric competition for light. This leads the community towards a low-diversity state, composed of mostly high-performance, large plant species. We further argue that this pattern will emerge unless the plants’ root competition is asymmetric, in which case, like its counterpart aboveground, belowground herbivory may buffer diversity by reducing this asymmetry between the competitively superior and inferior plants. I conclude my dissertation by discussing the implications of my research on the state of the art in intraspecific trait variation and belowground herbivory, with emphasis on the necessity of more diverse theory development in the study of these fundamental interactions. My results suggest that the influence of these processes on the biodiversity and stability of grassland systems is underappreciated and multidimensional, and must be thoroughly explored if researchers wish to predict how the world’s grasslands will respond to anthropogenic change. Further, should researchers myopically focus on understanding central ecological interactions through only mathematically tractable analyses, they may miss entire suites of potential coexistence mechanisms that can increase the coviability of species, potentially leading to coexistence over ecologically-significant timespans. Individual-based modelling, therefore, with its focus on individual interactions, will prove a critical tool in the coming decades for understanding how local interactions scale to larger contexts, and how these interactions shape ecological communities and further predicting how these systems will change under human-mediated stress.",https://openalex.org/W3154438755,ea3ad0d7899f608ee0ea0442a051ef59bad056c2,0,True,0.9563785791397095,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.14416,In Memoriam: Barry Sinervo 1961–2021,"In March 2021, evolutionary biologist and ecologist Professor Barry Sinervo at University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) passed away at the age of 60, after a brave struggle with cancer (Fig. 1). Barry is mourned by his wife of 32 years Jeanie Vogelzang, his son Ari Sinervo, and other family members. His premature death has also caused much sorrow among his departmental colleagues at UCSC, scientific collaborators around the world, and former students and postdocs, including the authors of the current piece. Here, we summarize Barry's scientific achievements, discuss his legacy, and provide some personal memories of our interactions with him when carrying out research in his laboratory. Those of us writing this article are former postdocs and PhD students who all spent considerable time in Barry's laboratory, and we wish to share some of the intellectual excitement we experienced during these formative years of our academic careers. Together, our team covers a large time span of Barry's faculty career, and the authors of this piece include Barry's first PhD student (R.C.), his first European postdoc (E.I.S), his last PhD student (P.B.) as well as his co-workers, students, and laboratory members in between these periods (A.M.A., L.L., and S.C.M.), from 1997 and onwards. Barry started his scientific career by earning a B.Sc. in biology and mathematics at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. He then joined the Department of Zoology at Washington University, under the supervision of Professor Raymond Huey. It was during these early formative years that Barry developed the classical experimental protocols that would subsequently establish him as a young and rising star in evolutionary biology: experimental techniques to manipulate egg and offspring size, that he termed “allometric engineering.” By experimentally removing part of the yolk from eggs of two species of sea urchins (Strongolycentrotus) and later also Western Fence Lizards (Scleroporos occidentalis) and side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana), Barry and his colleagues explored the fitness and performance consequences of maternal effects and early developmental history on offspring (Fig. 1B). This pioneering experimental work resulted in a series of classic and highly influential papers published in Evolution and Science (Sinervo and McEdward 1988; Sinervo 1990; Sinervo and Huey 1990; Sinervo et al. 1992). Barry's early work illustrates his interest in both development and ecology, and how a knowledge of both fields is crucial to understand evolution. Barry was an early pioneer in linking ecology to development and evolution, well before the later rapid growth of evolutionary developmental biology (“evo-devo”) as an emerging and increasingly popular research topic. Barry's experimental manipulations of offspring size revealed the mechanistic links between size and offspring performance, including how ecologically important traits like sprint speed are important for lizards to escape predators and the general importance of allometric size-performance relationships. These classical experimental phenotypic manipulations also revealed the importance of early environmental effects and offspring development, which many biologists nowadays appreciate as being fundamental to understand both ecological and evolutionary dynamics of natural populations. It provided the foundation that established him as a truly integrative evolutionary biologist. This work also earned him the Society for the Study of Evolution's (SSE) Theodosius Dobzhansky Prize in 1992, and a Young Investigator Award from the American Society of Naturalists. Interestingly, Barry's advisor Ray Huey did not believe that these experimental manipulations would work and advised him against doing them, but he was happy to be proven wrong when they turned out successful (R. Huey, pers. commun.). This episode underscores that PhD students should not always follow the advice of senior supervisors and that pushing through ideas you really believe in can lead to scientific innovations. After defending his PhD in Seattle, Barry subsequently moved to UC Berkeley, where he obtained the prestigious Miller postdoctoral fellowship, working with the endocrinologist Professor Paul Licht. During this time in Berkeley, Barry developed his interests in the mechanistic and developmental basis of life-history variation. He designed experimental endocrinological manipulations on female side-blotched lizards with the aim of understanding the trade-off between egg quantity and egg quality. By experimentally manipulating circulating levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in females, he showed in a paper in Journal of Experimental Zoology that this hormone had pleiotropic effects on both traits: it simultaneously increased egg number and decreased egg size as a correlated effect (Sinervo and Licht 1991a). This was a groundbreaking experiment that resulted in a paper in Science (Sinervo and Licht 1991b) and which established a concrete and mechanistic proof-of-principle of the theory that life-history trade-offs were likely to emerge as a result of antagonistic pleiotropy of genes with effects on several different traits, as discussed in a later publication by Barry in American Naturalist (Sinervo 1999). After obtaining faculty positions as professor, first in Bloomington at Indiana University and subsequently at UCSC, Barry continued to study side-blotched lizards in an individually marked field population at Los Baños (Merced County) in California (Fig. 1C). He chose this study location after driving around a large part of California, scouting out different sites that would be suitable for a long-term population study of marked individuals. Once Barry had settled on the field site at Los Baños, he continued to use his experimental techniques and applied them in the field, aiming to understand how natural selection shaped life-history evolution in a realistic ecological setting. The landscape at Los Baños is characterized by dry, grassy areas and rolling hills, where enormous numbers of lizards live in high density on semi-isolated rocky outcroppings (Fig. 1C). Although these little animals are fleet of foot (Barry would have called them “wiley”), he had mastered the art of capture and routinely captured and processed more than 100 individuals per day. Those of us who participated in the field work at Los Baños often participated in daily competition with Barry to catch as many lizards as he did, but he was typically able to catch more than the rest of the team combined during a whole day, which says a lot about his outstanding skills as a field biologist. It was after several years of field work at Los Baños that Barry discovered and described the evolutionary and social dynamics leading to perhaps his most famous paper in Nature in 1996: “The rock-paper-scissors game and the evolution of alternative male strategies” (Sinervo and Lively 1996) (Fig. 1D). Together with his colleague Curtis Lively (still at Indiana University), they described three heritable male throat color morphs that persist in this population, while fluctuating in their relative frequencies every generation (Sinervo and Lively 1996). Based on field data and game theoretical modeling, Barry and Curt argued that this polymorphism was maintained by a particular form of negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS), namely a rock-paper-scissor game (RPS), in which the different morphs showed intransitive fitnesses, each morph having its own strengths and weaknesses in intrasexual selection and competition over access to females and mating opportunities (Maynard Smith 1996). RPS had previously been a theoretical idea, explored by the evolutionary theorist John Maynard Smith, but here was a possible case of its operation and existence in a natural population in the wild. It is fair to say that the RPS-paper was met with some skepticism by many evolutionary biologists and the idea does not seem to have had a big impact on the field of behavioral ecology. However, outside of behavioral ecology, intransitive fitnesses in general, and the RPS-paper in particular, have had a huge impact in fields like theoretical evolutionary biology, biodiversity, adaptive radiations, community ecology, evolutionary genetics, and microbial experimental evolution (Rainey and Travisano 1998; Palumbi 1999; Czárán et al. 2002; Kerr et al. 2002; Zhang et al. 2013; Arnold 2020). We strongly suspect one reason why behavioral ecologists have not fully embraced the concept of intransitive fitnesses and the RPS is a cultural barrier: in the behavioral ecology tradition, there is often a strong focus on evolutionary endpoints and optima, rather than on the dynamics of the evolutionary process. To be fair, Barry had a tendency to oversell the RPS, and the dynamical complexity within Barry's conceptual evolutionary models sometimes became intractable. Barry strongly rejected simpler concepts such as indirect genetic effects (IGE) arising from social and parental interactions (Wolf et al. 2001) that could potentially explain the observed patterns. Barry claimed that these more simplified approaches sacrificed mechanistic insight to tractability at the cost of understanding. This position reflects Barry's integrative approach, which aimed to merge genetics, development, physiology, and mathematics to understand the evolutionary process. Barry therefore did not shrink from complexity and attempted to understand rather than minimize its impact. The last words about the RPS and the male color polymorphism have probably not been said, but we strongly suspect that Barry got the major picture right about how this and other forms of enigmatic behavioral polymorphisms are maintained. In 1998, interested in studying dispersal in the side-blotched lizards, Barry visited Jean Clobert in Paris. Barry and Jean immediately had passionate discussions about how dispersal could be linked with the three color morph system. Barry visited Jean's captive common lizards at Foljuif (south of Paris) and to Jean's surprise they discovered that female common lizards also displayed some color morphs. From this first encounter, a long-term collaboration between Barry and Jean was established primarily focused on color morphs, the role of corticosterone, and the effects of climate change. In common with many of us, Jean has data and experiments that he carried out with Barry that are still to be published. Jean treasures Barry's personality and will forever remember the intense scientific discussions they had over the years. A common theme in all our memories of Barry is that he was certainly one of the rare people with whom we have had such rich scientific exchanges. Several of us in the group shared Barry's strong interests in maternal effects, and particularly the idea that maternal physiology could be a powerful way to translate social dynamics into offspring developmental trajectories. This work led to a series of papers on the role of early environmental and maternal effects and the effects on phenotypic integration, including how egg size and maternal hormone investment can trigger changes in phenotype to successfully integrate each mating type with effective antipredator strategies (Lancaster et al. 2007, 2010; Paranjpe et al. 2013). This work was strongly facilitated by Barry's curiosity-driven research efforts, aiming to link social environments with physiology and with the aim to understand the complexity of dynamic evolutionary processes. In addition to his papers, Barry also leaves behind a global network of scientists grateful for their time spent interacting with him and others in the vibrant environment he created in his laboratory. The authors of the current piece all spent some of our formative years in Barry's laboratory. The insights we gained by interacting with Barry and other members of the laboratory were instrumental for us in our subsequent research careers. Below, we include some personal anecdotes to provide a general flavor of the unique and extremely creative research environment that we experienced in Barry's laboratory. One of us (E.I.S.) joined Barry's laboratory as a postdoc at UCSC in 1997, when Barry was a young faculty member (36 years) and had just started his position. E.I.S. was Barry's first postdoc, and came from Sweden where he had mainly been exposed to classical behavioral ecology during his PhD. It was somewhat of a cultural and scientific shock being exposed to a new way of thinking in Barry's laboratory, where population genetics, development, and big questions in evolutionary biology were discussed during laboratory meetings and during commutes to the field site at Los Baños. Initially, E.I.S. found himself in doubt over the basic story about the lizard throat color polymorphism and the causes of its evolutionary maintenance, and he was not alone in the laboratory in these feelings. Working with Barry in the field, compiling data and performing experimental investigations gradually convinced E.I.S. that this polymorphism was indeed a real phenomenon in demand of explanation. Together with Barry and several other colleagues in the laboratory, including A.M.A., we also explored the dynamics of the color polymorphism in females, its fitness consequences and genetic background, and documented striking genetic correlations between color, immune function, and life-history traits (Sinervo et al. 2000; Sinervo and Svensson 2002; Svensson et al. 2009). Another one of us (S.C.M.) met Barry while he was in Finland as the external examiner of a PhD thesis in 2002, was encouraged to apply for funding, and would go on to visit his laboratory every spring for 4 years from 2003 to 2006. One year, together with L.T.L. and Donald Miles, we decided to investigate proximate mechanisms behind the behavioral, physiological, and morphological differences of the different color morphs. In true Barry style, we carried out a natural selection experiment in the field, investigating selection on suites of hormone-mediated traits. Rather than manipulating testosterone (T) and corticosterone, Barry was enthusiastic to look at the upstream gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) that regulate T to highlight endocrine cascades. Through manipulations of LH and FSH, whose natural expression is thought to be under genetic control, we also showed that the responses to hormones in the different color morphs were at least partly adaptive. For example, the yellow-throated male morph is more plastic and can upregulate these hormones opportunistically, whereas the other morphs lack such plasticity (Mills et al. 2008). Despite the scale of these projects, the laboratory was a well-oiled machine with lizards in multiple coolers arriving to be processed and then returning to the field. Even when S.C.M was isolated at home with TB (which Barry diagnosed in 5 minutes though it had baffled doctors for months), the coolers kept on coming, the doorbell would ring and the cooler would be left there on the doorstep! When P.B. (Barry's last PhD student) told her then herpetology professor, Dr. Jim Archie at Cal State Long Beach that she had been accepted into Barry's laboratory, he dropped everything to give her a huge hug in his excitement for her to enter into the laboratory of one of the greats. Barry's influential RPS work, textbook material in her undergraduate courses, left P.B. feeling slightly intimidated to join a laboratory with such a big name. Although Barry was a big name with big ideas, he had an equally big heart. Barry lived and breathed for the lizards, so much so that even in the trenches of his fight with cancer and in the worst of the COVID pandemic, to preserve the work and isolate himself he lived in an old trailer on the field site itself so he did not have to make the long drives to and from his home. His dedication was admirable. Barry certainly never thought small, and it was exciting to be involved in his large ideas. We try to continue this legacy today and encourage our students not to shy away from whole-organismal performance experiments. We also repeat more trivial but amusing day to day quotes from Barry, such as the five Ps: Prior Planning Prevents Poor Performance, an important classic as Lizard land was a couple of hours drive away from the laboratory. Barry also leapt at any occasion to teach, such as the time one of us (S.C.M) chose a rock to sit on whilst filling in field notes. The rock was hiding a rattlesnake coming out of hibernation which soon let us know of its presence, but unaccustomed to this sound, it took Barry's shout of RUN! to get S.C.M. moving. Once scattered field notes had been retrieved and Barry's laughter had subsided, he proceeded with a short, but detailed and interesting description of how that rattle would forever be embedded in her amygdala and hippocampus. The formative years in Barry's laboratory stimulated our interests in correlational selection (selection for different character combinations), genetic and phenotypic polymorphisms, adaptive landscape theory and its various applications. Our interests in adaptive landscape theory and applications were also partly stimulated by the physical landscape of the dry, rolling grassy hills at Los Baños and “Lizard Land.” Indeed, Barry would often wax poetic on the long drives to California's great Central Valley, comparing the rugged landscapes of the Diablo range to Sewall Wright's adaptation heuristic. These long drives were an important resource for all of us, as they provided rare opportunities to gain uninterrupted access to Barry, whose pace of work (both physical and intellectual) were so intense that he was otherwise tough to pin down. We drove to the field site together each day, riding in Barry's filthy 1986 Toyota 4runner. Whoever sat up front with Barry on the ride home had nearly 2 hours of private audience to chat, while the others, exhausted from a long day under the hot Valley sun, would sleep in a pile in the backseat. Barry was just as happy to talk about science and natural history, as he was to recount stories of his metaphysical experiences with a crow in the desert, but in the background, his mind was always turning over the problem of natural selection acting on the lizards with those brightly colored throats. As a result of the vibrant intellectual atmosphere in Barry's laboratory, E.I.S. and R.C. (who was one of Barry's first PhD students) some years later edited a joint volume about adaptive landscapes together (Svensson and Calsbeek 2012). L.T.L. later across the Atlantic to Sweden became a postdoc in the laboratory of E.I.S., eventually establishing herself as faculty member at University of Aberdeen in the UK. Barry was half-Finnish and thanks to his mother was fluent in Finnish. In 2004 in Jyväskylä (Finland), Barry astonished the audience, and delighted the Finns, at the 10th Jubilee Congress of the International Society for Behavioral Ecology (ISBE), by starting his plenary in Finnish. One half of the audience was certainly shocked as 5 minutes into his talk, Barry was still speaking in Finnish! Otherwise, Barry was never very fond of going to international conferences but he traveled extensively and had a huge international network of collaborators all over the world. His laboratory was surely an intellectually very stimulating and international arena, where many long-term friendships and close collaborations were initiated, with or without his active involvement. We are very grateful for this indirect influence that Barry had on our research careers and that emerged more or less spontaneously in the stimulating but also challenging environment that his laboratory constituted with many brilliant and creative minds flourishing and joining from different parts of North America, Europe, and many other parts of the world. E.I.S. and L.T.L also remember being introduced by Barry to some classics in evolutionary biology, such as William Provine (1971), Richard Levins (1968), and Richard Lewontin, in particular The Dialectical Biologist (Levins and Lewontin 1985). Barry had a remarkable breadth of knowledge in the history of ecology and evolutionary biology, including philosophy and dialectical thinking. This knowledge base clearly influenced the way he thought about science, carried out his research, and supervised his students and postdocs. During the last part of Barry's career, from 2008 and until his premature death in March 2021, his research efforts were mainly directed toward problems of ongoing climate change and its potentially disastrous consequences in terms of increased extinction risks of animal populations. Barry and a large team of collaborators from all over the world published a highly cited paper in Science in 2010, where they highlighted and described the risks of altered thermal niches and elevated extinction risks of lizards in the face of rapid climate change and global warming (Sinervo et al. 2010). Barry also co-authored another influential study documenting the collapse of desert bird communities in the Californian Sonoran desert, which was also attributed to climate change (Riddell et al. 2019). Although the lizard study was later criticized by other researchers who questioned the alarming conclusions that 39% of lizard populations and 20% of species would go extinct by 2080 (Clusella-Trullas and Chown 2011), Barry and his colleagues responded to these criticisms and maintained their pessimistic message (Sinervo et al. 2011). Only time will tell whether Barry and his colleagues were correct, but there are other worrying studies indicating that climate-mediated extinctions might already be happening in taxa other than lizards (Wiens 2016; Lister and Garcia 2018). Barry's worry and engagement with the threats from climate change were sincere. Whether one agrees or disagrees with his pessimism about a forthcoming and dramatic wave of climate-mediated extinctions of lizards, his family members encourage all those who want to honor Barry's memory and work to donate to the climate movement and organization “350 Org” ( which fights for a sustainable future and for a transition to a better future free of fossil fuels. Finally, it might be worth reflecting about how Barry saw his research on climate-mediated extinction risks being related—if at all—to his earlier work in more basic science in life-history evolution, sexual selection, game theory, and color polymorphisms. We have also asked ourselves this question, and are quite confident that he did not view these lines of research as being separate lines of inquiry, but rather as reflecting his general curiosity in understanding our natural world and life on this fragile planet. His later work on how temperature conditions and early environmental effects interacted with lizard throat colour exemplifies such integrative science, spanning climate change research, sexual selection, and life-history evolution (Paranjpe et al. 2013). Barry was unfortunately unable to complete his research and provide a general summary of his different research themes, but he was thinking deeply about how to apply game theory to accelerate the transition from a world dominated by fossil fuels to a more sustainable future. He was also thinking about how to apply RPS-related ideas to understand the universe at large, plans that he mentioned to E.I.S. in their last physical meeting in Santa Cruz in January 2020. We finish this obituary by noting that there is a growing research interest and attention to how climate change and temperature can affect sexual selection, sexual conflict, and the evolution of color polymorphisms (Lancaster et al. 2017; García-Roa et al. 2020; Svensson et al. 2020). We are sure that Barry would have been delighted and excited by these recent developments. E.I.S. wrote the first draft of this manuscript based on discussions and with input from all the other co-authors. P.B., R.C., L.T.L., A.M.A., and S.C.M. all contributed to subsequent additions, rewriting, and finalizing of the manuscript. The authors declare no conflict of interest. Associate Editor: D.

https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.70051,Local‐ and Regional‐Scale Climate Variability Drives Complex Patterns of Growth Synchrony and Asynchrony in Deep‐Sea Snappers Across the Indo‐Pacific,"ABSTRACT Climatic variation can play a critical role in driving synchronous and asynchronous patterns in the expression of life history characteristics across vast spatiotemporal scales. The synchronisation of traits, such as an individual's growth rate, under environmental stress may indicate a loss of phenotypic diversity and thus increased population vulnerability to stochastic deleterious events. In contrast, synchronous growth under favourable ecological conditions and asynchrony during unfavourable conditions may help population resilience and buffer against the negative implications of future environmental variability. Despite the significant implications of growth synchrony and asynchrony to population productivity and persistence, little is known about its causes and consequences either within or among fish populations. This is especially true for long‐lived deep‐sea species that inhabit environments characterised by large‐scale interannual and decadal changes, which could propagate growth synchrony across vast distances. We developed otolith growth chronologies for three deep‐sea fishes ( Etelis spp.) over 65° of longitude and 20° of latitude across the Indo‐Pacific region. Using reconstructed time series of interannual growth from six distinct Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), we assessed the level of spatial synchrony at the individual‐, population‐ and species‐scale. Across five decades of data, complex patterns of synchronous and asynchronous growth were apparent for adult populations within and among EEZs of the Pacific Ocean, mediated by shifts in oceanographic phenomena such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Overall, our results indicate that the degree of synchrony in biological traits at depth depends on life history stage, spatiotemporal scales of environmental variability and the influence of ecological factors such as competition and dispersal. By determining the magnitude and timing of spatially synchronous growth at depth and its links to environmental variability, we can better understand fluctuations in deep‐sea productivity and its vulnerability to future environmental stressors, which are key considerations for sustainability.",https://openalex.org/W4407150852,a2ea6c7720e3d6ee5e0bd33991772d755aeba80b,0,True,0.949474036693573,0

Anyone wishing to contribute articles or reviews to this section should contact him at the Department of Natural Sciences, University of St. Francis, 500 N. Wilcox, Joliet, IL 60435, (815) 740–3467, E-mail: wbromer@stfrancis.edu. Understanding basic concepts such as community structure, species diversity, and succession, as well as the possible causes of variation in species distribution and dispersion, is fundamental to undergraduate ecology courses. Given that determining species diversity or successional patterns requires knowledge of species abundances, it is important that students are also familiar with sampling theory, specifically how to draw an impartial sample of individuals from a community. Although outdoor exercises allow students to gain valuable experience in community ecology through sampling living communities, in large introductory courses, in winter-term courses, or in courses that survey a wide array of ecological topics, there are often too few laboratory periods to include outdoor exercises. We developed a web-based learning object, EcoSampler 〈 to provide Bucknell University majors in biology, animal behavior, and environmental studies with virtual experience sampling communities while facilitating their learning about community structure, species diversity, and succession. Here we offer an overview of EcoSampler and describe how we use this web-based simulation model in a sophomore-level Population and Community Biology (BIOL 208) course. Our students, paired on computers, use EcoSampler during one 3-hour laboratory session. Students interpret EcoSampler's output and prepare a written report, which is due at the following week's laboratory meeting. EcoSampler, which is freely available via the Web, also can be used in other ways, including as a homework assignment to supplement lecture materials or as an exercise that is part of an online course. Regardless of how EcoSampler is used, our experience suggests that it provides students with a strong conceptual and methodical background, and that it is very effective when coupled with a subsequent or concurrent field trip that involves community sampling. Instructions for EcoSampler are included online, so this article is intended to provide an overview of our learning object and to describe how we use it in our Bucknell University course. EcoSampler analyzes two digitized Pennsylvania old-growth forests using either area (quadrat) or distance (point-quarter) sampling methods with haphazard, random, or systematic sample-selection protocols. Because EcoSampler estimates the amount of field time necessary for each methodology, students discover that the efficiencies of sampling methods vary. In addition, they learn that sample bias differs among haphazard, random, and systematic sampling protocols, and that species differ in their spatial distributions. EcoSampler's summary of basal diameter size-class distributions facilitates predictions about the successional trends in the sampled communities, and its calculation of species richness and diversity enables comparison of the community structures of the two virtual forests. An obvious advantage of this learning object is that large numbers of students can simultaneously sample and analyze forest community data using several sampling criteria and methodologies, and they can gain appreciation of fundamental ecological concepts as they interpret their results. We use the 18 questions included with EcoSampler to guide our students' interpretation of results and frame their written reports. The objectives of EcoSampler include: (1) understanding sampling theory as applied to community ecology; (2) gaining understanding of area and distance-sampling methods and contrasting their advantages and disadvantages; (3) comparing sample bias with haphazard, random, and systematic sampling protocols; (4) learning about the measurement of species abundance (e.g., density, dominance, frequency), species dispersion, and community structure; (5) gaining understanding of ecological succession and species replacement; and (6) communicating results and conclusions via a written report. The Mohn Mill virtual forest is based on tree density, dominance, and frequency results from Abrahamson and Gohn's (2004) field study (Fig. 1). This species-rich virtual forest is particularly useful to explore sampling protocols as well as species dispersion and the effects of disturbance in bringing about successional change. Located in central Pennsylvania, the 154-ha Mohn Mill site (41°4′ N, 77°8′ W) includes bottomlands as well as gentle to steep slopes. Elevations range from 420 to 570 m above mean sea level. The area's sandstone-derived soils include loams, sandy loams, and stony to very stony loams. The Mohn Mill area was logged between 1904 and 1912 during the period identified as the “clear-cut or hemlock-chemical wood” era but the area has not experienced timber extraction since. Chestnut blight eliminated the American chestnut from the site's canopy during the 1930s, which likely facilitated additional dominance by oaks. The site experienced gypsy moth outbreaks from 1979 to 1982 and during 1996, and severe windstorms as well as ice and wet snow events have impacted the forest's canopy. Currently, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus browsing is inhibiting oak regeneration, and acid precipitation may be influencing the acidic soils and plant performance (Abrahamson and Gohn 2004). Selection of the virtual forest to sample involves an interface that also facilitates control of the appearance of the simulation model. The Mohn Mill area is a Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources proposed wild-plant sanctuary in part because of the presence of the federally endangered northeastern bulrush (Scirpus ancistrochaetus Schuyler). The small, seasonal ponds that harbor northeastern bulrush occur within an oak-canopied forest matrix that is likely crucial to the long-term survival of this plant. Although the Mohn Mill site is protected from logging, Abrahamson and Gohn (2004) showed that the site is experiencing a replacement of white, chestnut, red, and black oaks by more shade-tolerant red maple and eastern hemlock. As the overstory oaks age and die, oaks are replaced disproportionately by red maple and eastern hemlock depending on microsite conditions. This transition will have major implications for understory plants, including the persistence of the northeastern bulrush, because of reduced available light. EcoSampler's tree size-class histograms help students understand such species replacements and the consequences of succession. The Snyder-Middleswarth virtual forest is based on tree density, dominance, and frequency results from a field study by Zawadzkas and Abrahamson (2003: Fig. 1). This virtual forest has limited tree-species diversity, which offers a useful contrast to the Mohn Mill forest. Because it has marked topographic variety, this forest is useful to explore the patterns of species occurrence and dispersion in relation to spatial variation and edaphic conditions. The Snyder-Middleswarth Natural Area (40°48′ N, 77°19′ W) in central Pennsylvania is among the largest of the few old-growth eastern hemlock–yellow birch forests remaining in Pennsylvania. Thanks originally to inaccessibility and in 1965 to its designation as a National Natural Landmark, a 135-ha portion of this forest has never been logged. The Snyder-Middleswarth forest is located in a narrow and steep ravine between two east- and westrunning ridges, and as a consequence the ravine has well-developed north-facing and south-facing slopes as well as a bottomland and ridge-top community. Slopes vary in steepness up to 68% with elevations ranging from 450 to 550 m. The soils are extremely stony and sandy well-drained loams that have weathered from Tuscarora sandstone. These soils have low to moderate available water capacity and have virtually no pH buffering capacity. As a consequence, acid precipitation is further acidifying the already acidic soils, which is likely impacting on plant performance. While there are recurrent natural disturbances within this forest including windstorms, especially those associated with snow or ice events, disturbance from acid precipitation and hemlock woolly adelgid are the most serious threats (Zawadzkas and Abrahamson 2003). The latter threatens the continued domination of the old-growth forest by eastern hemlock. Gypsy moth outbreaks since the mid-1970s have impacted the oak canopies of the south-facing slope and ridge tops during multiple growing seasons, and browsing by white-tailed deer is limiting tree regeneration. Sampling the Snyder-Middleswarth virtual forest facilitates student examination of species dispersion and distribution and the consequences of disturbances to succession. The reliabilities of haphazard, random, and systematic sampling protocols. Students learn that haphazard sampling introduces bias and that systematic or random protocols avoid bias much better. The efficiencies of area and distance sampling protocols. Students discover that one protocol may be a better choice than the other depending on the community. Succession and the spatial-occurrence patterns of forest trees. Students examine the successional status of individual forest species and use life-history attributes of species to consider why a given species has its specific distributions within a forest mosaic. Community structure. Students recognize that diversity indices are dependent on both species richness and species evenness and that both measures are important to understanding community structure. Patterns of species occurrence and abundance due to spatial variation in topography and/or edaphic conditions. Students discover that north-facing and south-facing slopes as well as ridge tops and bottomlands have different species composition and abundance. They also realize that forest trees are differentially adapted to environmental conditions. Assignment 1: Haphazard, Random, and Systematic Sampling Protocols.—This assignment investigates sampling bias among haphazard, random, and systematic sampling protocols with the Mohn Mill mixed oak–red maple virtual forest. Students are presented an aerial “community view” of the Mohn Mill forest and sample to determine the abundances of the tree species within the community (Fig. 2). Without prior discussion of sampling bias, samples are almost inevitably drawn disproportionately from the center portion of the community. Because of the nonuniform distributions of species, such repeated sampling of a limited portion of the virtual forest generates a biased sample in which some species are oversampled while others are undersampled. Next we have our students draw their samples using random and then systematic sampling protocols. Students compare species-abundance estimates obtained with each protocol to the community's actual abundance measures, which enables them to gain an understanding of strengths and weaknesses of each protocol (Fig. 3). Community and Quadrat views of the Mohn Mill virtual forest. Colored symbols indicate the identity, size, and location of individual trees. The virtual forest can be sampled with or without an overlaid grid of quadrats or points that can be sampled haphazardly, randomly, or systematically. Community view showing sampled quadrats (quadrats with Xs), topographical view option, and point-quarter sampling view along with example output for the Snyder-Middleswarth Natural Area. During each assignment, students must determine when the virtual community is adequately sampled by examining a graph of the cumulative number of species sampled vs. the number or area of samples taken. Species–area graphs generated by our model provide students with a semi-objective means to determine the area or number of plots to sample (Fig. 2). Each assignment is accompanied by a set of questions designed to guide the students' interpretation of results and evaluate their understanding. In assignment 1 these questions examine the reliabilities of haphazard, random, and systematic sampling by comparing the estimated values based on sampling to actual values. Students conclude that haphazard sampling can introduce bias. Students are then asked to reflect on the efficiencies of random versus systematic sampling in the field using the estimates of time commitment for each sampling (Fig. 3). Students recognize the tradeoff of collecting many samples to gain accuracy in measures of rarer species versus the time and cost of obtaining numerous samples. Students then compare the accuracy of their estimated abundance measures for common versus rare species against actual values. They discover that estimates for rare species are less reliable than those for common species. A final component of assignment 1 asks students to describe the population structure for the most common species by examining its density, dominance, frequency, and importance. Using histograms of tree sizes (Fig. 3), they can determine whether a given species is invading or dropping out of the sampled community or whether its population is stable. Information about the species' natural history, available within EcoSampler, helps connect the virtual forest trees with tree life-history traits (Fig. 2). Assignment 2: Area vs. Distance Sampling Protocols.—The second assignment uses point-quarter sampling of the Mohn Mill virtual forest and compares the results to those from assignment 1, which employs area sampling. Students learn that the point-quarter method is well suited for sampling widely spaced individuals or large individuals (e.g., trees). Assignment 2 questions focus on (1) when area vs. distance sampling would be preferred; (2) whether equal numbers of quadrats and points provide the same reliability for abundance measures; (3) species richness and its meaning; and (4) the meaning of importance values and how two species could have identical importance values yet quite different abundance measures. Assignment 3: Dispersion and Succession.—Species dispersion, using the Morisita Index of Dispersion (Morisita 1959, Brower et al. 1998), and secondary succession are explored using the Mohn Mill virtual forest. Questions direct students to interpret the dispersion indices of species, most of which are aggregated. Using the life-history information that is available for each species (Fig. 2), students make connections between life-history traits and patterns of dispersion (e.g., clonal propagation of trees and their consequent clumped distribution). The second component of this assignment has students explore the relationship of the Morisita Index and frequency. They find that the two measures are inversely related, and furthermore that frequency, when considered along with density, offers insight into spatial occurrence. Students soon appreciate that frequency, density, and dominance each express different key aspects of population structure. A third component of assignment 3 investigates succession via an examination of species recruitment with size-class distributions of tree basal areas (Fig. 3). Although tree sizes do not precisely represent tree ages, tree-size data do provide considerable insight into a species' successional status (Skowno et al. 1999). Our questions ask students to predict the future success of dominant trees in the Mohn Mill virtual forest via a comparison of the size-class histograms generated from samples with expected sizeclass distributions for hypothetical species with stable, successfully invading, unsuccessful or episodic invasion, and senile size-class structures (Fig. 4). A fourth component of assignment 3 is for students to recognize that the size-class distributions at Mohn Mill show little recruitment of oaks but substantial recruitment of red maple, suggesting that the forest is undergoing successional change as oaks are replaced by red maples. Expected size-class distributions for trees showing stable, successfully invading, unsuccessful or episodic invasion, and senile, dropping-out populations. Assignment 4: Community Structure.—While dispersion is a characteristic of populations, measures of species richness and species diversity are characteristics of communities that help assess community structure. To calculate species diversity in the virtual forests, EcoSampler uses the popular Shannon-Wiener Index. In this assignment, students sample the Snyder-Middleswarth eastern hemlock–yellow birch virtual forest and compare the species richness and diversity of this forest to these values for the Mohn Mill virtual forest sampled in the previous assignments. They find that Snyder-Middleswarth virtual forest has less species richness and diversity. Students also compare the size-class distributions for sampled eastern hemlock and yellow birch to theoretical expectations (Fig. 4) and find that both species have stable size-class distributions. Thus, they predict that both species are likely to continue dominance at the site unless disturbances such as hemlock woolly adelgids and/or acid precipitation alter the conditions that favor these species. However, when the size-class distributions of sweet (black) birch are examined, students discover a distribution that suggests an unsuccessful or episodic invasion (Fig. 4) based on limited current recruitment. When available life-history information is considered, students conclude that sweet birch has this size-class distribution because it experiences episodic recruitment due to its dependence on disturbance-generated canopy gaps that enable light levels that support its colonization and establishment. Assignment 5: Topographic and Edaphic Influences on Plant Distribution.—This assignment examines the variation in species distributions due to topographic and edaphic factors by comparing the northfacing and south-facing slopes as well as the bottomland and ridge top in the Snyder-Middleswarth virtual forest. At the latitude of central Pennsylvania, a 20° south-facing slope receives an average of 40% more midday insolation than a 20° north-facing slope. This difference has a striking effect on the heat budgets and available soil moistures of the two slopes; south-facing slopes are warmer, their evaporation rate is typically 50% higher, and their available soil moisture is lower (Smith and Smith 2001). Systematic sampling is used to locate quadrats within four of the five labeled subsets of the virtual forest: southern and northern ridge tops, north-facing and south-facing slopes, and bottomland. Students first compare the bottomland, which is dominated by eastern hemlock and yellow birch, to a ridge top, which is covered by red and striped maple, chestnut oak, and sweet birch. The more xeric and higher wind-damaged ridge-top conditions are more suitable for shorter-lived and colonizing species. Next students compare the more xeric south-facing with the more mesic north-facing slope. They find that the south-facing slope has more chestnut oak and red maple, while the north-facing slope has more eastern hemlock, white pine, and sweet birch. Finally, students describe the population structure of chestnut oak on the south-facing slope. The learning outcome of EcoSampler exercises can be assessed in a variety of ways. One option is to conduct a pre-lab assessment in order to help prepare students to use EcoSampler. Students read the available online introduction, background, and assignments sections before coming to lab. We begin our lab with 30–35 minutes of introduction of relevant concepts (e.g., community structure, succession) because our EcoSampler lab exercise comes prior to discussions of community ecology in lecture. (Community ecology is covered in our spring course lectures in the latter portion of the semester when our labs involve field exercises.) We have found that our students need to understand the following points before beginning the EcoSampler exercise: (1) a community is an assemblage of interacting populations of species that occupy a given area; (2) a community is characterized by both a physical and biological structure; (3) the mix of species that make up a community defines its biological structure; (4) population interactions such as competition, predation, parasitism, and mutualism influence community organization; (5) the biological structure of a community can be defined, in part, by the density, frequency, and dominance of each of the species that compose the community; (6) spatial variation is part of community structure; and (7) succession of species occurs in communities over time. In order for the exercise to be most effective, students must understand why it is necessary for ecologists to know what species compose a community, how abundant those species are, and if some species are increasing in abundance while others are decreasing over time. At the conclusion of the introduction to the EcoSampler exercise, students could be asked to write a two- or three-minute paper on any misconceptions that they held about key points prior to the lab presentation (Sacchi 2006). Even with a moderately detailed introductory presentation, we have found that our students comfortably complete all five assignments within a three-hour lab period. Instructors who adopt EcoSampler can select specific assignments or use all five assignments depending on their audience and time available. Alternatively, instructors can develop their own assignments using EcoSampler's virtual forests and sampling capabilities. We evaluate our students via written reports (submitted electronically) that are due at the following week's laboratory. Reports are graded using a key and guidelines to standardize evaluation. We would be happy to make this key available to adopting instructors, upon request. We encourage our students to consider concepts and issues that lie beyond the scope of the assigned exercises. Discussions in lecture or subsequent labs provide an excellent way to engage students. For example, students can be asked to ponder the value of having measures of species abundances within a community that are taken at different times along a timeline (i.e., having a baseline against which future measures of species abundances within that community can be compared). They should consider the types of questions that can be answered with such timelines to understand species change and succession, impacts of land-management plans, development of conservation plans for natural areas, or recovery plans for threatened or endangered species. Alternatively, a discussion of the reasons why plants show clumped distributions can challenge students to consider life-history traits. Such discussions help students understand that environmental gradients are the rule in nature, so that a site that is good for one individual of a given species is likely to be good for other individuals of that species. Students might also realize that there are forces in nature that counteract clumping. Competition among individuals for water in deserts or light in forests can favor regular spacing, as can damage done by plant antagonists such as herbivores or pathogens that more easily find clumped host plants (Barbour et al. 1999). We have found that conversations about community structure and species diversity can probe the degree of student understanding of the complexity of trophic interactions within communities of differing species diversity. For example, communities with high species diversity may have more complex and varied interactions (e.g., energy transfer, predation, competition) among species than communities of low diversity. A final example is especially pertinent for “pre-med” majors: it involves a discussion of the importance of statistically valid sampling methods in determining the efficacy of new medicines and the responses of cells to various treatments. EcoSampler is hosted on a web server at Bucknell University. The client side runs well on either a Windows-platform PC running Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox or a Macintosh computer running Safari or Internet Explorer. Cookies and JavaScript must be enabled. The preferred screen resolution is 1280 × 1024, but should be at least 1024 × 768 in order to view pages. DSL/Cable Modem or higher is the preferred connection because EcoSampler is graphically rich. The simulation model is implemented using Active Server Pages (ASP)/VBScript via Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0. Community data are stored in a Microsoft Access database, and EcoSampler's code makes extensive uses of IIS session variables for storing data as the community is sampled. Output is standard HTML, with tables used to format various views of the community. The HTML includes a limited use of JavaScript, primarily to prevent problems from using the Back button. In addition to the basic functionality, EcoSampler includes several “administrative” scripts for generating community data. Introductory ecology courses include discussions of community structure, species diversity, and succession. Appreciation of sampling theory is essential to student understanding of these and other ecological concepts. Using data from two Pennsylvania forests, an old-growth eastern hemlock/yellow birch community and a mixed oak/red maple community uncut since the early 1900s, web-based EcoSampler's virtual forests facilitate student investigation of sampling theory, community structure, and succession. The model employs area (quadrat) or distance (point-quarter) methods, with haphazard, random, or systematic sampling protocols. Students learn how to recognize when they have adequately sampled a community and a “time/effort” function permits students to assess the labor trade-offs of sampling protocols. Output from EcoSampler includes absolute and relative measures of species density, frequency, dominance, and importance, size-class distributions, and dispersion, as well as species diversity and natural history information about each species. EcoSampler's five assignments examine (1) potential for bias in haphazard, random, and systematic sampling protocols; (2) area vs. distance sampling procedures; (3) species dispersion and successional trends based on analysis of size-class distributions; (4) community structure via species diversity; and (5) variation in species distribution due to topographic and edaphic factors. EcoSampler is freely available using high-speed, internet-connected Windows or Macintosh computers as we described above, as homework assignments, or projects for an online course. We thank Steve Jordan, Matt McTammany, Catherine Blair, and Harold Ornes for their insightful comments and suggestions.

https://doi.org/10.1155/2024/9040431,Predictive Role of Species Diversity on Aboveground Carbon via Functional Diversity and Dominance in the Moist Afromontane Forest: Implications for Conservation Policies,"The moist Afromontane forest of Ethiopia plays a crucial role in carbon storage and mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To guide effective conservation policies, it is essential to understand the relationship between species diversity and carbon storage in this unique ecosystem. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the response of aboveground carbon (AGC) to species and functional diversity and their effects on AGC in the Yayu Coffee Forest Biosphere Reserve (YCFBR). Using different plot sizes, we collected vegetation data from the core, buffer, and transitional zones of the reserve. We selected traits related to plant‐life strategy, competition ability, response to disturbances, and climate change. Structural equation models (SEMs) were employed to assess the effects of species diversity, functional diversity, and functional dominance on AGC. Data analysis was conducted using R software. Our results revealed that the effects of species richness on AGC were mediated through functional diversity and functional dominance, as demonstrated by both the full mediation and partial mediation models. This suggests that the selection effects and niche complementarity are mutually exclusive yet equally important for predicting AGC. The findings further indicate that functional diversity and functional dominance together accounted for significant predictors of the AGC by 21% in the YCFBR. From a practical standpoint, findings highlight the importance of conserving species diversity as a means to maintain higher AGC in the tropical moist Afromontane forests. In conclusion, this research significantly contributes to the scientific literature by providing valuable insights into the complex relationship between species diversity and carbon storage. The results emphasize the crucial role of functional diversity and dominance in predicting AGC, underscoring the importance of biodiversity conservation for climate mitigation efforts. These findings have practical implications for the development of effective conservation policies tailored to protect and sustain the carbon storage potential of this unique ecosystem.",https://openalex.org/W4401666813,22abec31a313ba9e3afc571f6bab5b8c1ec882c8,0,True,0.9950581789016724,0
https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1584652.v1,Response of fish biota to dams in the Lower Colorado River Basin: empirical findings and utility for predicting responses to climate and water use change,"Over the past century, development of the Colorado River Basin for water resources changed a dynamic river into a managed system. Seasonality in flow, temperature, and turbidity is reduced, and formerly riverine habitats are now reservoirs. These changes have played out in the fish fauna. Native species have declined and non-natives have increased. The key alteration, relative to the past, is increased competition and predation, especially at juvenile stages, which is likely mediated by more stable flow and resource regimes. A dataset (SONFISHES) assembled by W. L. Minckley and covering 150 years of fish occurrence in the Lower Colorado River (below Glen Canyon Dam) has provided insight into patterns in extirpation among native fishes and range expansion among non-native fishes. Several studies have combined these data with measures of extinction risk to explain how range fragmentation and species’ traits correlate with observed extinctions or threats in native species. Another study analyzed range shifts within a strategy space of potential fish life histories (originally introduced by K. O. Winemiller and K. A. Rose) to understand how human activity has created and removed ecological niches. Together, these studies support a causal link between environmental and faunal change. This strongly suggests that continuing the status quo will result in further extirpation and extinction of native fishes. I argue, however, that current knowledge is not yet sufficient to quantitatively forecast the magnitude and timescale of the response in fish biodiversity to any projected future environment. Such forecasting requires a model that quantitatively relates the environment to persistence in the strategy-space of fish life histories. Unfortunately, we do not need such a model to make the qualitative prediction: threatened “big-river” fishes will eventually go extinct without intervention.",https://openalex.org/W2258441801,36cfb1b19546e48df9ca93b49ceffb61a794592d,0,True,0.9799970388412476,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.71466,Effect of Resource Abundance on Woodland Rodents' Demography at Latitudinal Extremes in Europe,"Climate change effects on primary productivity are especially evident along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. Some of the species with a fast reproductive cycle strategy and relying on primary productivity may rapidly respond to such changes with alterations to demographic parameters. However, how these bottom-up effects may emerge in systems with different population dynamics has not been elucidated. We aimed to assess the role of food availability on rodent demography in populations characterised by different dynamics, that is multiannual cycles in Northern European populations and mast-driven outbreaks in Southern European populations, both driven by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We live-trapped woodland rodents at these latitudinal extremes in two study systems (Norway, Italy) while deploying control/treatment designs of food manipulation providing ad libitum trophic resource availability, albeit not reflecting the natural resource fluctuations. We applied a multistate open robust design model to estimate population patterns and survival rates while controlling for seasonal variation, intrinsic traits, and co-occurrence of sympatric species. Yellow-necked and wood mouse (Apodemus spp.) were sympatric with bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) in Italy, while only the latter was trapped in Norway. Food provisioning increased both survival and population size of bank vole in Norway, where temperatures are harsher and snow cover persists in winter. In milder Italian habitats, the wood mouse abundance was boosted by food availability, increasing also survival rates (but only in females), whereas the bank vole showed a decrease in both parameters across sexes. We speculate that overabundant food resources may trigger some forms of competition between sympatric wood mouse and bank vole, although other types of interactions, such as predation and parasitism, may also contribute. By manipulating food availability in two systems where rodents have different population dynamics, we showed how resource availability exerted bottom-up effects on rodent demography, especially in the context of climate change, although being mediated by other intrinsic and extrinsic factors.",https://openalex.org/W4411007675,1639ff2351a63e233b9d163e7c2cadf5c1d82cbf,0,True,0.9829335808753967,0
https://doi.org/10.3732/ajb.90.4.658,Understanding feedback between ecological systems requires feedback among scientists,"On a global scale, ecologists have long recognized the importance of feedback between aboveground and belowground ecological systems. In our general ecology classes, we teach that major world biomes are characterized by distinctive vegetation types, which are influenced both by climate and soil types. Soils, in turn, are a product of the mineral composition of the bedrock, the particular soil weathering action caused by that climate, and the physical and chemical characteristics of the organic matter returned to the soil by the vegetation. Soils and vegetation, students learn, are inextricably connected with each defining the identity of the other. In Communities and Ecosystems, Linking the Aboveground and Belowground Components, David Wardle examines how aboveground biological communities and ecosystems are linked to those in the soil at spatial scales smaller than a biome. He articulates his primary goal as considering terrestrial communities and ecosystems from a combined aboveground–belowground perspective in order to identify feedback between the two systems and to interpret how such feedback influences ecosystem functions such as carbon and nitrogen cycling. Wardle convincingly argues that understanding the linkages is important for predicting how changes in the components, including those caused by anthropogenic activity, affect ecosystem functions. Most linkages between aboveground and belowground ecological systems directly or indirectly involve plants, and thus a consideration of how plants interact with other organisms serves as a major, but unstated, theme of this book. Plants earn this level of attention because input of plant litter is the primary resource for decomposer food chains in the soil, and by the nature of a vascular plant's existence it extends simultaneously above- and belowground. If interactions with other organisms in either system affect plant performance, repercussions are likely to occur in the other system simply because the plant exists there as well. Although plants serve as a logical focal point, Wardle's task is still an enormous one. The goals he sets out for himself require that he consider nearly all terrestrial organisms—starting with the invertebrate and microbial components of decomposer soil food webs and including a consideration of the intraspecific and interspecific variation in plant traits that influence interactions with herbivores and the decomposers. By his inclusive definition of aboveground–belowground linkages, he must also consider the actions of all organisms that feed on or parasitize plants or interact with them in a beneficial fashion either above- or belowground. Even animals that feed at higher trophic levels cannot be ignored as their excretory wastes and decaying carcasses are sources of nutrient input into the soil. Most of us work with only one or a few components of these systems; we may not think about each system in its entirety, let alone all the connections between the systems. … there have been few attempts to bring together the widely dispersed literature on aboveground and belowground communities or to interpret this in an ecosystem context. This is because aboveground and belowground ecology have traditionally developed largely independently of one another; the two subdisciplines usually publish in different journals or bodies of literature. In this light it is perhaps not surprising that often a finding that has been hailed as a breakthrough in one subdiscipline has long been common knowledge to the other. The breadth of information Wardle covers in connecting these subdisciplines is, in fact, impressive. As a plant ecologist with little prior knowledge of soil fauna, I learned a great deal, for example, about the diversity and interactions of soil invertebrates. Wardle presents this literature by addressing the question of whether decomposer food webs are regulated by “top-down” predators or “bottom-up” resource availability. Understanding the nature of the controls is important to interpreting how these systems respond to changes in the quantity and quality of plant litter. This example serves as a nice illustration of why we must understand how a system operates before we can understand how a linkage to another system affects it. Still, no one person can be an expert on the diverse subjects addressed here, and I think that a collaborative effort among aboveground and belowground ecologists would have been a more productive approach. A collaborative effort among experts in the disparate fields—perhaps beginning with a workshop—could have increased the level of information synthesis and served as a forum stimulating conversation between soil scientists and aboveground ecologists who, according to Wardle, have traditionally not talked to one another. Wardle himself has published extensively and broadly in the area of aboveground–belowground interactions and thus is as qualified as any single individual to write a book of this scope. Nevertheless, the quality of the synthesis and the readability of the material varies greatly, seemingly dependent on his familiarity with the literature. Wardle devotes considerable attention to the questions of whether increased plant species diversity begets either increased net primary productivity or increased community or ecosystem stability. He has contributed previously to the literature debates these questions have generated, and he justifies their inclusion here because primary productivity ultimately determines the quantity of litter available to soil biota and because the diversity of plants and the diversity of soil organisms are potentially related. Central to both questions is whether an increase in the number of plant species generally represents either an increase in the number of plant functional types, with species exhibiting low overlap in niche space and greater resource partitioning, or an increase in positive interactions among species. Such phenomena are necessary to link productivity or stability to species diversity directly (Tilman et al., 1996, 1997). An alternative explanation, especially for studies that vary diversity experimentally by drawing different numbers of species at random from the same species pool, is based on purely statistical grounds. More diverse systems can be more productive or more stable simply because an increase in the number of species increases the probability that key productive (or resilient) species are included in a particular experimental plot (Aarssen, 1997; Huston, 1997). Wardle's strong preference for the latter explanation is apparent in his analysis of the literature. Wardle does not give other potentially controversial topics as much attention. For example, he mentions the possibility that plants share carbon through mycorrhizal hyphae and cites but does not discuss studies pointing out the difficulties in demonstrating its functional importance (Fitter et al., 1998; Newbery et al., 2000). Still, he says, if fungal hyphae reduce competition then “fungal-regulated positive interactions might not be uncommon in plant communities.” An examination of evidence that could shed light on whether hyphal connections among plants are common and biologically important to the plants (or the fungi) would have been welcome. Could we draw relevant information from the plant competition literature? Are the combined effects of competition between roots and any facilitation that might occur through fungal hyphal connections likely to result in net positive belowground interactions between neighboring plants? Just how common IS facilitation through belowground interactions, even if the mechanism cannot be identified? The reduced level of synthesis applied to some subjects also made for dry reading. Again, I expect this reflects the fact that Wardle is less familiar with these particular subjects and not that the information is inherently less interesting or controversial. For example, the chapter “Belowground Consequences of Aboveground Foodwebs” mostly summarizes how herbivory varies with particular leaf traits and how these same leaf traits affect the quality of leaf litter returned to the soil, with little interpretation of the information. He makes a secondary point related to the “not-so-novel” idea that dung and urine impact soil resources, explaining that the animals making these deposits may travel over considerable distances and into different habitats, potentially impacting communities beyond the one in which they fed. While linkages between aboveground and belowground ecological systems are indeed numerous and some of them complex, many can be collapsed into the framework of what is often called plant–soil feedback in the current literature. In this context, ecologists are particularly interested in how plants affect the abundance and diversity of soil organisms with which they interact and how these organisms, in turn, affect the performance of different plant species. The relevant soil organisms include root herbivores and both free-living microbes and those forming associations with plants, such as nitrogen-fixing bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi. Wardle includes several examples. Plant–soil feedback is either characterized as positive, whereby a particular plant species propagates an associated biota that improves the performance of that species relative to other plants, or negative, whereby the associated biota reduce plant performance. Beneficial effects of microbes include increased levels of nutrient mineralization, nitrogen fixation, suppression of pathogens, and production of substances promoting plant growth. Negative feedback can be expressed through the action of host-specific pathogens or mechanisms by which plants and microbes compete for nutrients. Negative feedback may even involve mutualists, such as mycorrhizal fungi, if they differ in their level of host specificity or confer different levels of benefit to different hosts (Bever et al., 2002). Such phenomena have clear implications for the maintenance of species diversity in both the soil and plant communities. Wardle mentions “a vast agronomic and biotechnological literature” about how several types of interactions with microbes affect the growth of crop plants, but he limits his discussion to ecological studies that have dealt with nutrient transformations, pathogens, and mycorrhizae and refers the reader to several reviews of the agricultural literature. I think it likely that many findings of agricultural studies could be applicable to ecological systems, and including some discussion of them here might have suggested new lines of research to ecologists. In the introduction, Wardle discusses why studies of the soil biota are so challenging, making soil communities still a largely unexplored frontier: (1) The physical and chemical structure of the soil is complex, and it is difficult to study even macroorganisms in situ within such a complex, opaque matrix. (This explains, for example, why we know many times more about the activity and consequences of aboveground herbivores than about those operating strictly belowground.) (2) Soil communities generally contain far more species than aboveground communities occupying comparable space, perhaps because the microhabitats are more diverse and complex. (3) Countless species of soil organisms remain unidentified. It is estimated that less than 0.1% of soil microbial species and 10% of the soil microarthopods (André et al., 2002) have been described. Considering Wardle's broad statements about our limited knowledge of the underground biological world, I find it surprising that he omits coverage of recent technological advances that seem to be revolutionizing the ecological study of soil microbes, moving the field beyond traditional culturing techniques that have failed to capture so many species. One approach characterizes microbial communities based on phylogenetically relevant variation in important biological molecules such as nucleic acids or phospholipid fatty acids (Hill et al., 2000). Microbial genes can be extracted directly from the soil and their sequences compared with those of known organisms, and fluorescently labeled taxon-specific oligoncleotide probes can be used to identify taxonomic groups within their natural microenvironments. Analyses of cell wall fatty acids are informative because unique fatty acids serve as signature molecules in specific groups of microorganisms. Additionally, because cell walls rapidly degrade upon cell death, phospholipids prove useful as a measure of active microbial biomass. Still another approach examines microbial diversity through the physiological capabilities of community constituents (Hill et al., 2000; Waldrop et al., 2000). These profiles are often based on the activity of specific enzymes involved in the degradation of particular macromolecular carbon compounds, such as lignin or cellulose, or the microbes' ability to utilize a diversity of carbon-based substrates. Stable isotopes can be used as tracers to identify the role of microbes in carbon and nutrient cycling and to determine whether they compete with plants for the same pool of nutrient resources. These techniques allow researchers to examine the ecosystem functions of different microbial communities without determining their species compositions. While all of these methods have their limitations, their refinement should continue to speed progress in the exploration of the soil frontier, supplement information gained about ecosystem function from traditional experiments manipulating litter characteristics or soil inoculum (André et al., 2001), and improve our understanding of how feedback occurs between aboveground and belowground systems. Indeed, as Wardle points out, the more we learn about soil microbial communities, the more complicated their relationships with plants appear. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were once thought to be nonspecific in their choice of hosts, but now it is clear that the performance and thus the level of benefit experienced by both the plant and the fungus often depends on the identity of the partner species. The performance of a host plant may vary with the number of fungal species associated with its roots (van der Heijden et al., 1998a), and plant community diversity may be related to mycorrhizal fungal diversity (van der Heijden et al., 1998b). Recent evidence shows how plant–soil feedback can occur at microscales, as plant roots can influence the rate of nitrogen mineralization performed by bacteria in the rhizosphere (Firestone et al., 2002). The fact that plant performance and the outcome of plant competition can be greatly affected by the activity of soil microbes calls into question the ecological relevance of countless greenhouse experiments conducted over the last several decades without soil biota. These are studies where plants were grown in sterilized “soil-less” potting media, typically consisting of a mixture of ground peatmoss, vermiculite, or other inert ingredients to which inorganic nutrients were added. Wardle's last substantive chapter tackles the broad topic of how human activities are impacting ecological systems through effects on linked aboveground–belowground components. Initially, I was surprised to find so much of the book, roughly a sixth, devoted to conservation issues, but this chapter turned out to be a lucid and comprehensive explanation of how even small changes in climate or species composition can have far-reaching ecological repercussions. Within the context of aboveground–belowground linkages, it is easy to appreciate how anthropogenic perturbations can potentially alter basic ecosystem functions of carbon and nutrient cycling and feed back to affect species composition at different trophic levels. This chapter would serve as a solid synthetic review of the subject for a class reading assignment. Most of the major conservation issues are included: the introduction of exotic species, the selective removal of key ecologically important native species, large-scale and long-term changes in land use, increased nitrogen deposition, CO2 enrichment, and global climate changes caused by changes in the composition of atmospheric gases. Wardle explains very well how the introduction of invasive species can alter species interactions and interrupt normal ecosystem function, but his coverage of species extinctions or deliberate, selective removal of particular species by humans is less informative. He dwells too much on the occurrence of historical large-scale extinctions of megafauna, such as happened in North America 10 000–12 000 years ago, without much evidence for how such losses affected the ecosystem. He speculates that “these extinctions have almost certainly profoundly affected the functional composition of the vegetation” based on what has been learned from studies of contemporary systems, and he refers the reader to an earlier chapter. Better data are apparently available on the ecological consequences of species additions. Wardle not only includes examples of exotic plants and aboveground herbivores but also exotic soil organisms. Earthworms have been well studied. Important consequences of non-native earthworms include changes to the physical soil structure, the overall composition of the soil biota, the accumulation of organic matter, and nutrient supply rates. Invasive plants can alter many of these same soil factors indirectly by causing changes in the quantity or quality of plant litter, with resultant changes in the cycling of carbon and nutrients and in the species composition of the decomposers. One active area of research with invasive plants focuses on how plant–soil feedback figures in their success, i.e., to what extent changes induced belowground by the invaders hinder the reestablishment of native vegetation (Klironomos, 2002). Wardle also presents a seemingly comprehensive description of how nitrogen and CO2 enrichment are likely to affect ecosystems, primarily through their fertilization effects on plants. By increasing primary productivity they can increase the quantity of litter available to decomposers, but they can also alter the chemical constituents of leaves in ways that alter the rate of decomposition and shift the constituents of decomposer food webs. Direct effects of nitrogen deposition on soil microbes can also occur but are less predictable. Climate changes as a consequence of elevated CO2 levels are expected to involve a 3°C increase in air temperatures, more temporal variability in precipitation, and more extreme weather events in general. He reviews how these changes may affect primary productivity, the composition of the vegetation, and the geographic ranges of plant species. Understandably, the soil biota is much more likely to respond directly to changes in moisture availability than to temperature increases of the expected magnitude, although large increases are predicted in the rate of decomposition and the loss of carbon through respiration of soil organisms. I would have liked more discussion of how climate-induced changes in the composition of the vegetation may mitigate or exacerbate soil carbon loss through increased soil respiration. He mentions some exchanges on these questions in the literature but does not elaborate. Finally, I feel obligated to comment on the organizational style of the book. Although every chapter ends with a section entitled “Synthesis,” these sections are largely chapter summaries, with the amount of synthetic analysis reflecting the amount contained in the chapter itself, which varies greatly. To the extent that these sections do provide a new synthesis of the material already covered, incorporating these ideas into the chapter would have made the factual material more interesting. The final chapter, entitled “Underlying Themes,” likewise serves mainly as a summary and does little to tie the information together in new ways. Wardle does do a commendable job summarizing the different ways that aboveground and belowground ecological processes are connected. However, given his uneven development of the diverse topics included in this book, I believe that aboveground and belowground ecologists would be better informed of and inspired by the others' research if they could speak for themselves. I am reminded of the story of how several blind men give completely different descriptions of an elephant based on the small portion of the animal each is able to touch. The same concept need not apply to the descriptions of ecosystems. The latter may be a case where the “elephant” could be better described and understood by the combined efforts of several individuals, each of whom is an expert on some component but who may be unfamiliar with the rest of the “animal.”",https://openalex.org/W1990778063,1c22efbe34a5558f78a670efd2890a2ff008cc75,0,True,0.9751712679862976,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/raq.12952,Mitigating the role of aquaculture in crustacean invasions,"Aquaculture plays a critical role in alleviating malnutrition and poverty1 and stands as the world's fastest growing food sector,2 especially in developing countries.3 Global aquaculture production increased by over 600% from 1990 to 2020,4 accompanied by a diversification of farmed species, reaching 425 species in 2021.5 Notably, the number of crustacean species reared commercially has risen from 30 to at least 49 between 2017 and 2020.4, 6 Many farmed species are non-native in their farmed regions, a trend first observed in 2000 in developing countries such as Cuba, India, Philippines, Chile and Brazil, where 60%–95% of all production is non-native species.7 The growing number of farms and/or farm sizes, along with non-native species farming, increases the risk of intentional or accidental release into the wild.3 This is likely to increase propagule pressure8 as was seen with the redclaw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) which escaped from captivity or abandoned farms and established wild populations in many regions.9 Farmed species are selected for traits which exacerbate their establishment and spread in the wild10 such as rapid growth, broad diet and resistance to parasite.11 Biological invasions, involving human-related introduction, establishment, expansion and potential impact of species outside of their native ecosystem, pose a significant threat to biodiversity and ecosystem functions.12 For example, the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) introduced for aquaculture, is now a global invasive species13 which transmits diseases14 and predates on and competes with native species, thereby altering food webs and habitat structures.15 Notwithstanding biological invasions occasional benefits, they do not outweigh their massive economic impacts,16 estimated to be at least USD 423 billions in damage and management,12 also affecting aquaculture itself.17 The signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and the European green crab (Carcinus maenas), collectively inflict damages totalling US $271 million.17 We suggest that the rapid development of farms and farmed species is likely to increase the risk of biological invasion18 unless new biosecurity protocols are developed in parallel.19 While the causal links between aquaculture and biological invasions have been extensively studied for specific countries or species,20-23 substantial gaps remain not least in the case of crustaceans, which are significant both as major aquaculture species and as invaders. Therefore, we focus on farmed crustaceans, although our conclusions apply to other taxonomic groups involved in aquaculture. We show why some farmed crustaceans pose an increasing risk of biological invasions and how this risk can be mitigated. Here, we assess commercially farmed crustaceans classifying them by country (native-non-native) and invasive history (lack or presence of invasions historically). Using these classifications, we recommend biosecurity and management strategies while highlighting the gaps in our current understanding. To compile a comprehensive list of farmed crustacean species, we used the most up to date aquaculture dataset of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations24 (FAO) and supplemented it with our own literature research. For identifying the invasive crustacean species, we cross referenced multiple invasive alien species databases25-28 ensuring we removed duplicates and validated scientific names using GBIF. Our final dataset includes 63 crustacean species (Appendix S1 & S2) which have been farmed in 126 different countries globally (Table 1; Appendix S3). Here, non-native species are defined as a species outside its natural range in the country where it is farmed. Of these countries, 111 have farmed at least 1 non-native species with 64 farming exclusively non-native species and 15 that farm only native species (Table 1). The whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) is the most widely farmed species, cultivated across 54 countries (Table 2; Appendix S3). The signal crayfish has only been farmed in non-native countries whereas the giant mud crab (Scylla serrata) has been farmed only in native countries (Appendix S3). Out of the 63 farmed species, 22 are considered invasive worldwide impacting at least 77 countries (Table 1; Appendix S1 and S4). Here, we define invasive as actual or probable negative ecological or economic impact documented in at least one population worldwide. The red swamp and the spiny-cheek (Faxonius limosus) crayfishes are invasive in over 20 countries (Table 2). There are several pathways by which crustaceans have been shown to spread including ballast water, pet trade and hull fouling (Table 2). However, it is established that aquaculture is a major driver/pathway in invasion crustaceans with at least 19 of the 22 invasive species introduced through aquaculture (Table 2, Appendix S5), 14 of those affecting at least 30 countries (Table 1; Appendix S4). Causes of their introduction include unintentional escape (e.g. when used as fish food49), intentional release from crustacean aquaculture31, 51 or transfer through 'hitchhiking' on other species as was the case with the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis).42, 65, 66 It is important to note that these results are likely underestimated due to the incomplete reporting of both farming and invasions.

Human activities (infrastructure, agriculture). Ecosystem change or habitat alteration Human health Threat to or loss of native species64 These 22 invasive crustaceans farmed in aquaculture originate from diverse regions and environments including marine, brackish, and freshwater85 (Appendix S1). Their introductions into non-native regions have resulted to multiple and severe impacts (Table 2). For instance, the European green crab and Chinese mitten crab outcompete and prey on native species, leading to native population declines; consequently, they are listed among '100 of the worst invasive alien species'.67 Four of these 22 species are also listed on the European list of invasive alien species of concern, the spiny-cheek crayfish, the red swamp crayfish, the signal crayfish, and the Chinese mitten crab.68 The types of impacts and associated mechanisms of these invasive crustaceans are diverse (Table 2). Tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon) and red swamp crayfish are vectors of viral diseases such as the white spot syndrome baculovirus.69 Crayfish also transmit crayfish plague caused by the oomycete Aphanomyces astaci, listed among the 100 worst invasive alien species globally.67 Some crustaceans are considered ecosystem engineers15, 70 that can significantly impact the structure of invaded habitats, thereby affecting other species and altering ecosystem dynamics. The European green crab reduces eelgrass biomass by damaging rhizomes and plant shoots while burrowing for shelter and prey.71 Similarly, the red swamp crayfish alters water quality, increasing turbidity and reducing dissolved oxygen levels.72 These invasive crustaceans can also impact economic activities such as aquaculture, fisheries and agriculture.17 The burrowing behaviour of the common yabby (Cherax destructor) can jeopardize dam walls, thus affecting farmers.73 In Lake Naivasha, local fishermen estimated that the red swamp crayfish reduced their catch's food provisioning by up to 30% due to crayfish-induced damage to fishing nets.74 Thus, the risk on human activities results in massive economic consequences since four crabs— the blue crab, the European green crab (Carcinus maenas), the Chineese mitten crab and the blue swimmer crab (Portunus pelagicus)—and three crayfish species—the red swamp crayfish, the signal crayfish and the spiny-cheeck crayfish. —farmed in aquaculture rank among the costliest invasive crustaceans.17 Despite the acknowledged risks, there is still no global picture of the risk posed by farmed crustacean species in aquaculture. As a first step to address this gap, we propose a simple but widely applicable classification system based on two primary criteria: (1) the species documented global invasion history, and (2) whether the species is farmed outside its native regions. This system creates four possible outcomes, which we used to create a preliminary risk index ranging from limited risk (A) to high (D) (Figure 1). Species farmed in their native range are of low concern if escaped populations establish outside the farm (category A), but of medium concern if they are invasive in other (non-native) range (category B). Conversely, species farmed outside their native range and never reported as invasive (category C) have a high risk of becoming invasive if they escape and establish. The highest concern is for species farmed outside their native range and with a documented invasion history (category D). As a preliminary decision and in the absence of more in-depth risk assessments, we suggest applying appropriate management measures of the 63 farmed crustacean species based on their classification. Species with the lowest risk classifications (category A & B), which total 39 species, can continue to be farmed in their native regions, focusing biosecurity efforts on international transport. The seven species farmed in non-native countries (category C), require appropriate biosecurity and monitoring measures to prevent escapes from farms or transports. For the 17 species classified in the highest-risk category (D), farming in non-native regions must be avoided. Selecting species for aquaculture that minimize biological invasion risks while boosting economic potential is crucial. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize farming species within their native regions (A & B),10 particularly for open pond water farming. However, it is important to note that even native species can have detrimental impacts if released in large quantities.75 Farming species outside their native region may only be safe if not only species are reared in enclosed structures but also if current and future environmental conditions are unfavourable to their invasiveness. The current and future risks of establishment of non-native species can be predicted with tools such as species distribution models. Thus, conducting local or national spatial prediction analyses before establishing farms may allow the building of non-native farming while lowering the risk that species becomes invasive.76 Biosecurity and early response (following regular monitoring) are the most effective ways of managing non-native species.12, 77 The most basic approaches include: (i) farming sterile or unisex individuals, (ii) isolating farms with closed structures away from natural aquatic habitats, (iii) implementing clean-up protocols and special attire to prevent the spread of eggs and contaminants, (iv) using adequate equipment such as nets to prevent individual escape (e.g., through predation), including equipment maintenance to prevent long-term breakdowns and (v) regularly monitoring surrounding regions.78, 79 Risks are further reduced through tailored risk assessments20, 80, 81 and updating laws31 and regulations at different scales.20, 31, 82 For example, the four species in the European list of invasive alien species68 are forbidden to be farmed.83 We acknowledge that in many cases the long-term negative consequences of biological invasions may be disregarded because of the immediate social and economic benefits of aquaculture or a lack of awareness of the impacts. Our objective here was to highlight these consequences and promote responsible choices in aquaculture, such as selecting native species or implementing specific biosecurity measures, to collectively progress towards sustainable aquaculture with a reduced role in biological invasions. The classification we proposed serves this objective by informing about the risks posed by farmed aquaculture crustacean species. While based on current knowledge, it could be refined as more gaps in our understanding are addressed. Firstly, not all countries farming these crustaceans are currently present in the FAO dataset.24 Examples include Venezuela and Brazil which are not present in the FAO despite farming the tiger prawn, also invasive there.84 The efficient reporting of newly farmed species to the FAO dataset also varies, mostly by country. Secondly, there are species level gaps in the dataset, one example being the brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) which is not included in FAO as of now. Additionally, the FAO often provides information at higher taxonomic levels such as genus or family, thus complicating the identification of all farmed crustaceans, including potentially invasive ones. For instance, the Metapenaeus genus may include one of two invasive alien species of this taxonomic group. Our study may also underestimate the extent of farms located in non-native regions due to uncertainties in the native regions of some species. This is a problem particularly acute in very large countries (e.g., Australia, Brazil, Russia, USA, China) where farming is reported at the national level, whereas a species is native to specific parts of the country. For example, the smooth marron (Cherax cainii) is native to parts of Australia but invasive in others. Further, delays in detecting invasive species in the wild and in quantifying their impact hinder our ability to categorize species as invasive accurately. Finally, information on unregistered or illegal farms is lacking,9 making it difficult to assign accurate risk categories to some species. Consequently, we cannot rely solely on this dataset to assign a risk category to a given species. Our classification is presented more to illustrate our proposal, enhance understanding of invasion risks related to farmed species crustacean species, assist in prioritizing containment strategies, and inform the selection of future farming locations and species. This approach is also relevant for other farmed aquatic groups like molluscs or fish.

Tobias. “The potential and pitfalls of biofuels: how knowledge gaps may impair a comprehensive assessment.” Evaluating the ecological implications of biofuel production is an example of one way the Ecological Society of America can accomplish its mission to “ensure the appropriate use of ecological science in environmental decision making.” Despite emerging evidence that describes the potential benefits of carefully managed biofuels (e.g., Robertson et al. 2008, Tilman et al. 2009, Dale et al. 2010), the ecological community remains divided about whether or not science supports decision making that would incentivize biofuel production. In fact, the halls of the David L. Lawrence Convention Center (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvnia) echoed disapproval of biofuels this past August from some ecologists who cite scenarios of land use change and greenhouse gas emissions associated with first-generation grain-based biofuels, but are less aware of recent advances toward cellulosic fuel sources. The ecological benefits of biofuels have been debated in scientific literature, but there is much new information that suggests there are gains in ecosystem services that can be made with second-generation cellulosic feedstock crops. The population that made their way to this session were exposed to some of the most recent findings in biofuels research, beyond the first-generation perspective. The emphasis in biofuels research has indeed shifted to second-generation lignocellulosic crops (Somerville et al. 2010) because of the reduced environmental impacts relative to first-generation annual grain crops. Dr. Elya Gelfand (1) presented yet another line of evidence for the negative impacts associated with converting land to intensely managed annual grain crops. Gelfand measured terrestrial greenhouse gas (GHG) balances, using both static chambers and eddy covariance, to calculate the carbon debt associated with converting grasslands managed under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to continuous corn or corn–soybean agriculture. After conversion from CRP grassland, which formerly was a net sink of GHG, Gelfand estimated that the carbon debt was unlikely to be repaid if conventional corn–soybean agriculture were established on the same land. If no-till management were used with corn–soybean, the debt might be repaid after 18 years. These results support those previously published by others (e.g., Shapouri et al. 2003, Pimental and Patzek 2005) and underscore the importance of prioritizing research on second-generation biofuel crops. The majority of the presentations focused on second-generation cellulosic feedstocks, covering topics that ranged from the microbial communities that mediate nutrient cycling of perennial feedstock crops to the biofuel-related policies that affect forest carbon cycling. Four of the scheduled speakers presented research funded by the Energy Biosciences Institute (EBI) at the University of Illinois. EBI is the home institute for the session organizers, but it is also a leader in the field of biofuels research, housing scientists of many disciplines that collectively study the full production chain for bioenergy. Other speakers represented institutions across the United States, including the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center, another leader in bioenergy research, Michigan State University, Iowa State University, University of New Hampshire, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the Environmental Protection Agency. The session began with Dr. Marcelo Zeri (2) introducing the field experimental design that has been established by EBI in Urbana, Illinois, to resolve the carbon, nitrogen, and water biogeochemical cycles of alternative bioenergy agro-ecosystems. A replicated block design with side-by-side field trials of corn–corn–soybean rotation agriculture, high-diversity prairie communities, switchgrass, and miscanthus plots has been established (Fig. 1); each treatment is fully instrumented with separate eddy covariance towers, micro-meteorological stations, automated chambers to measure CO2 fluxes, N2O flux chambers, soil moisture and temperature probes, minirhizotron tubes, and separate tile drainage systems. The project represents the first large-scale and relatively long-term (10 years) experiment to test four bioenergy cropping systems under identical conditions. Established in 2008, data from the plots are still preliminary because the perennial grasses require three years to attain mature crop yields, but Zeri demonstrated the extensive data sets that are being compiled to account for water, C, and N cycling continuously in each cropping system. Energy Farm at the University of Illinois (Urbana, Illinois, USA) in October of 2010 after corn and soybean harvests (photo taken by Tim Mies, Energy Biosciences Institute). Beyond site-level GHG fluxes of bioenergy agro-ecosystems, there are also GHG fluxes associated with land use change that are caused by introducing new cropping systems. There is much uncertainty associated with estimates of land use change caused by biofuel crops and debates about indirect land use change especially persist in scientific literature. Dr. Kristina Anderson-Teixeira (3) introduced a concise method for calculating the GHG value of ecosystems (Anderson-Teixeira et al. 2010), an approach that could be used as a standard for estimating the impact of land conversion on climate change. Anderson-Teixeira asserts that GHG accounting should include direct fluxes, fluxes offset by the ecosystem replaced in a land use change event, and radiative forcing associated with all gas fluxes, as well as the physical properties of an ecosystem canopy. Estimates of GHG fluxes resulting from land use change will always be subject to the uncertainty in data that characterize the change. Nevertheless, standardized methods for quantification of GHG fluxes provide guidelines for measurements that are needed to resolve effects of land use change. Other speakers associated with EBI described studies on the invasiveness of miscanthus and microbial communities that mediate nutrient cycling in perennial bioenergy crops. Dr. Lauren Quinn (4) observed that traits favorable for bioenergy crops (rapid growth, pathogen resistance, high nutrient use efficiency, etc.) are also traits that are common to invasive species. Quinn introduced the invasive characteristics of Miscanthus sinensis, which has been classified as invasive in several states of the United States (USDA 2010). M. sinensis is a close relative of the sterile hybrid Miscanthus × giganteus, which has been introduced as a biofuel crop with great potential due to its high yields and low input requirements. Although M. sinensis has greater cold and drought tolerances that could be advantageous for crop success in northern sites, Quinn's results demonstrate that there would be a greater risk of invasion associated with plantations of M. sinensis relative to the sterile and self-incompatible hybrid Miscanthus × giganteus (Quinn et al. 2010). One of the perceived beneficial traits of Miscanthus × giganteus as a bioenergy feedstock is the unique microbial community associated with this crop that includes nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Davis et al. 2010), as described by Dr. Angela Kent (5). There have been an increasing number of studies that document endophytic and free-living bacteria that fix nitrogen in perennial grass species. Kent's recent work contrasts the microbial communities associated with Miscanthus spp. at different sites, both in native habitats (in Japan) and in Miscanthus agro-ecosystems in the United States. Diazotroph populations were similar among native and cultivated Miscanthus varieties, but assemblages were unique relative to other perennial grasses (e.g., switchgrass). Nitrogen-fixing bacteria were most abundant in warmer, wetter sites than in colder, drier sites. These results are indicative of the geographic variance that may exist in the sustainability of biofuel agro-ecosystems. A limitation to cultivating Miscanthus × giganteus is the need to propagate by rhizomes, as it is a sterile hybrid that does not produce seed. Rhizome planting requires wider spacing that results in less uniform coverage during establishment than seeded grasses, and therefore necessitates greater herbicide use for weed control. Dr. Emily Heaton (6) tested the hypothesis that nurse crops would increase the success of establishment and reduce the ecological impact associated with herbicide treatments. Heaton found that the benefits of this practice include soil protection, but there is a trade-off in yield losses. M. × giganteus appears to be affected by competition from the intended nurse crops. These results are a contribution to accumulating data that will eventually define best management practices for perennial biofuel crops. An emerging area of biofuel research that requires the engagement of ecologists to properly address policies and educate policy-makers is forest biomass removal. Dr. Steven Hamburg (7) presented an analysis of carbon emissions associated with harvesting biomass from forests in New England. Hamburg theorized that forests eventually reach carbon saturation, and that harvesting biomass can have lower emissions than fossil fuel burning after that point. The time required to reach carbon saturation and the subsequent break-even point with fossil fuel emissions is site specific. Hamburg also asserted that residue removal from forests already harvested for timber is a carbon-neutral source of biomass, because the residues in New England timberlands decompose quickly, releasing carbon back to the atmosphere. Matt Vadeboncoeur (8) continued the analysis of effects of biomass removal on forests by questioning the timing of nutrient limitation in harvested forests. His on-going research involves measuring macronutrient availability of forests that are subject to different frequencies and intensities of harvest. Ultimately, Vadeboncoeur's research should facilitate the identification of sustainable harvesting practices for hardwood forest in New England. The variation in biogeochemistry across sites prevents absolute estimates of sustainable harvesting, but policies are nevertheless being established to incentivize biomass removal from forests. The session concluded with research from Dr. Caroline Ridley (9) that analyzed the recent surge of scientific literature addressing biofuels. Ripley found there has been an exponential increase in the number of publications about biofuels in the last decade, with ~1500 expected in 2010. Despite the unprecedented research interest, there are key areas of research that are lacking. Most notably for the ecological community, there is a dearth of literature that addresses biodiversity responses to biofuel production. Clearly, the scientific debate about effects of land use change (e.g., Searchinger et al. 2008, Plevin et al. 2010) has implications for biodiversity, but there has been greater attention given to the effects of land conversion on GHG fluxes. To synthesize the diverse research that was represented in the topical session on biofuels, there are three emergent messages for ecologists. First-generation biofuels that use intensive conventional management practices have ecological costs that outweigh the benefits. Second-generation biofuel crops that are high yielding with low input requirements offer the ecological benefits of increased terrestrial carbon sequestration and reduced GHG emissions, but the land that is used to cultivate cellulosic feedstocks must be chosen carefully to reduce the risk of negative impacts. And finally, ecosystem research that characterizes spatial variance in biogeochemistry, biodiversity, and resilience has an important role for informing policies that incentivize biomass harvest for energy. Ecologists who are not directly engaged in bioenergy research will probably find it difficult to stay informed about all advances in the field because of the increasing volume of scientific discovery in energy biosciences. Regardless of the difficulty, the mission of ESA, as referenced in the introduction, is a call to “ensure the appropriate use of ecological science in environmental decision making,” and energy-related policies are some of the most important for ecological sustainability. The effects of emerging bioenergy production systems are not simple, and the science of ecology is a necessity in this research field. In the midst of ongoing debates about biofuels in both science and policy, opportunities for reversing the ecological impacts of fossil fuel consumption exist, and should not be overlooked.",https://openalex.org/W1993387026,866a017cd383d5a1c65fff11ab71ec4751e1b030,0,True,0.9684845805168152,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4574,Introduction: Honoring the contribution of Charles H. Peterson (1946–2020) to the field of marine ecology,"Ecological science addresses a wide variety of research questions, ranging from purely academic to narrowly applied. Major advances in ecology have occurred when fundamental ecological theories were used to formulate questions designed to address pressing practical problems, especially the impacts of human activities in natural ecosystems (e.g., Murdoch, 1994; Tilman et al., 2002; Vitousek et al., 1997). Marine ecologists have played an especially important role in assessing the ecological impacts of anthropogenic disturbances, as well as enhancing our capacity to conserve, manage, and restore marine ecosystems (e.g., Bertness et al., 2014; Jackson et al., 2001; Schmitt & Osenberg, 1996). Charles H. “Pete” Peterson (1946–2020) was a trailblazer and leader in testing, developing, and, most importantly, applying ecological theory to meet environmental challenges (Figure 1). In doing so, he made substantial contributions to ecological science and scholarship. At a time when few academic ecologists wanted to conduct applied studies, Pete performed those studies at a high level of rigor and demonstrated how ecology could be advanced through the application of theory. Pete's rigorous approach to study design, statistical analysis, and interpretation of results showed the flaws in often biased approaches that were being advanced by industry scientists. Pete passed away on October 24, 2020, at his home in Pine Knoll Shores, NC, USA. To help honor Pete's important contributions to ecology we have assembled this Special Feature of Ecosphere in which we present an impressive set of papers that report new results in applied marine ecological science that were inspired by Pete's research, teaching, and mentorship. Inspection of the history of natural science indicates that marine community ecology emerged primarily with the intent to address marine resource management challenges, initially the trophic links between marine benthic invertebrate communities and exploited demersal fish populations in northern Europe (Petersen, 1914). A deeper appreciation of that history reveals how local ecological knowledge helped Pacific Island people manage nearshore marine fisheries sustainably for over a millennium (Johannes, 1981). Yet, as recently as the 1980s, researchers working in applied marine ecology were too often labeled as industry consultants, as nonacademics. Judging from the poor quality of some applied work, the criticism was warranted. Criticism of applied ecology overlapped with a major reexamination, a critique, of ecology captured by Peters (1991). This intradisciplinary assessment followed a transition, led by Professors Joseph Connell (1961) and Robert Paine (1966), in which a qualitative natural-history-based approach, heavily reliant on correlative relationships between community patterns and environmental conditions, evolved to a more theory-driven, mechanistic, and experiment-based form of ecology (e.g., Peterson, 1982). Peters' critique in 1991 initiated the expansion of ecological synthesis science as a means to broaden the generality of research questions and seek answers to the toughest problems we face, including global-scale extinctions, habitat loss, and climate change. Out of these transformative periods emerged a greater appreciation for well-executed applied ecology. Pete Peterson was a leader in this renaissance, especially in the marine environment (e.g., Christensen et al., 1996; Lubchenco et al., 1991). Pete was an exceptionally creative and productive scientist, who made key contributions to many aspects, or subdisciplines, in ecology and marine science. He was highly interdisciplinary in his thinking and general methodological approach. Pete obtained a BA in Biology at Princeton University in 1968 before receiving an MS in Zoology (1970) and a PhD in Biology (1972) working with Professor Connell at the University of California, Santa Barbara. After a brief stint at the University of Maryland (Baltimore County), Pete moved to The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he taught, advised, and conducted research until he retired in 2019. Over the past half-century, Pete fundamentally transformed our understanding of marine ecosystems while also applying his research to solving environmental problems. He published over 200 peer-reviewed papers, and his research contributed conceptually to ecology, marine biology, environmental sciences, fisheries ecology, restoration ecology, and conservation biology. Trained as a benthic ecologist, Pete used coastal soft-sediment habitats as models to explore how key ecological processes such as competition, recruitment, and predation structure communities. He studied benthic boundary layer systems and fluid dynamics, at small and large spatial scales, to disentangle complex physical–biological processes. Pete examined how habitat created by seagrass beds, salt marshes, oyster reefs, beaches, deep-sea hydrothermal vent organisms, and Antarctic crustaceans influences marine communities and produces ecosystem services. Pete's research advanced basic ecological science, but some of his most profound contributions were in applied marine and fisheries ecology, a field he was influential in establishing. In the latter stages of his career, Pete's work touched on almost every aspect of marine conservation and restoration ecology. He recognized, long before many others, that fishing caused a plethora of ecological disturbances and worked tirelessly to develop sustainable fishing practices and management strategies (Botsford et al., 1997; Jackson et al., 2001; Lotze et al., 2006; Myers et al., 2007; Peterson et al., 1987, 2000, 2003a). He highlighted that oil spilled in coastal marine ecosystems triggers cascades of long-lasting ecological effects (Peterson et al., 2003b). Pete's exceptional capacity to integrate and synthesize ideas across disciplines led to his recognizing that restoring molluscan populations decimated by red tides in coastal North Carolina was critical to local fishers while also providing novel insights into population connectivity and recruitment limitation (Peterson et al., 1996). His work on oyster reef management and restoration ignited a major research emphasis that is now global in scale (Beck et al., 2011; Lenihan & Peterson, 1998). His many contributions to marine conservation were widely recognized and awarded, resulting in a Pew Fellowship and several prizes. Pete spent a large proportion of his career actively shaping policy and engaging in management on a range of environmental issues. He interacted well with politicians, water people, managers, program administrators, and the lay public. Pete served on numerous international and national advisory committees, including ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea), GLOBEC (Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics), NSF (National Science Foundation), and NCEAS (National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis). He was equally proud of his work on the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission, just one of the several environmental commissions in the state that Pete served on over the past several decades. North Carolina's coastal habitats and resources are more resilient thanks to Pete's tireless efforts and dedication. Above all, Pete was an educator, mentor, and naturalist. His ability to articulate difficult concepts in the classroom and in the field coupled with his enthusiasm for teaching inspired and enabled many to pursue careers in marine ecology. His passion for nature, whether fishing, birding, or walking with his friends and students, was immense and provided purpose for his scholarly pursuits. He especially liked his daily swims in North Carolinas' Bogue Sound. While rigorous, demanding, and often intense in his mentorship, Pete was always a strong advocate for his students and colleagues. Pete leaves behind a large network of former students, postdocs, and colleagues whose careers he helped shape. Many of those students, postdocs, and colleagues collaborated on this Special Feature that presents 16 papers encompassing a wide spectrum of applied marine ecological research inspired by Pete's examples. These papers are dedicated to the important legacy that Pete built over a long, very productive, and impactful career. Our Special Feature presents papers that report new and exciting results from a suite of important research topics that Pete helped to develop and promote, often with seminal and high-impact publications. Four papers focus on the ecological implications and impacts of anthropogenic disturbance in coastal ecosystems. Swinea and Fodrie (2021) examine the role sustainable fisheries play in the recovery of coastal human societies from catastrophic disturbance, in this case, the massive Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Fegley and Michel (2021) advance the way we should quantify the loss and recovery of ecosystem services on beaches degraded by oil spills. Pete played a big role in advancing beach ecology, a fact articulated by Emery et al. (2022), who report on how tides drive cyclical patterns of habitat partitioning by beach invertebrate species. Finally, Donaher et al. (2021) examine how facilitation by bivalves mediates the recovery of seagrass beds from disturbance. Another set of papers examines the role of seagrass as a coastal foundation species, but with a focus on trophic interactions, especially top-down effects on community dynamics. Namba and Nakaoka (2021) examine the influence of environmental conditions on the top-down control of eelgrass populations by herbivores in coastal Japan. Wong and Dowd (2021) explore how the functional traits of component species determine the level of secondary production in eelgrass communities. Alternatively, Geraldi et al. (2022) examine the effects of top-down control on foundation species, in this case the influence of predation on oyster abundance on subtidal oyster reefs. Pete was one of the first researchers to consider the role of landscape processes in driving marine population and community dynamics. To celebrate that research, Van Hoeck et al. (2021) develop a new technique to improve coastal management, specifically the population enhancement of target species, a model system that Pete often used to test both basic ecological theory and as a means to improve management outcomes. Linking land to sea, Gehman et al. (2021) uncover the influence that land use patterns have on estuarine ecosystems by modifying parasite–host interactions. Geissinger et al. (2022) introduce the use of stable isotopes as a technique to examine patterns of habitat use by the little-known, burrowing wrymouth that inhabit nearshore soft-sediment habitats along the US Pacific and Atlantic coasts. A final set of papers helps to advance restoration ecology, a topic of great interest and importance to Pete. Butler et al. (2021) reveal the role sponges play in helping to facilitate coral restoration. Grabowski et al. (2022) and Powers and Grabowski (2023) revisit and extend our understanding of the role that habitat structure, location, and hydrodynamics play in successful oyster restoration efforts. Paxton et al. (2022) provide a framework for better incorporating ecological principles, adaptive management, and experiments in the siting, design, construction, and evaluation of artificial reefs in the coastal ocean. To wrap up the Special Feature, Smith et al. (2022) and Lenihan et al. (2022) report on the ecological impacts of fishing and the use of marine reserves and collaborative fishery research in recovering, restoring, and managing coastal marine fisheries. In summary, the papers in our Special Feature represent a great tribute to the legacy of Charles H. Peterson and are research contributions that would have made him proud.",https://openalex.org/W4382725794,a434216004f104e38c368cf259fdce6698500f75,0,True,0.997603178024292,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/mms.13217,Depredation in Jamaica: An example of behavioral innovation in common bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>),"Behavioral innovation, which may occur through the discovery of novel information, the creation of new behavioral patterns, or the performance of established behavioral patterns in a novel context may give rise to advantageous traits in order to adjust to new environmental and social conditions (e.g., Reader & Laland, 2001; Reader & Laland, 2002). The development of more efficient foraging tactics is a form of behavioral innovation that may allow for the exploitation of food resources that are temporal or patchily distributed across large home ranges (McLean, 2001) and present in diverse ecosystems (e.g., Díaz López, 2006; Duffy-Echevarria et al., 2008; Hoese, 1971; Lewis & Schroeder, 2003; Noke & Odell, 2002; Patterson & Mann, 2011; Rossbach & Herzing, 1997; Visser, 2000). The development of novel foraging behaviors to exploit resources generated by human activities has been reported for many wild animals, including cetaceans (e.g., Noke & Odell, 2002), birds (e.g., Ducatez et al., 2013), and primates (e.g., Warren, 2008). For example, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) are particularly adept at developing innovative foraging behaviors based on the resources available in their environments, including using sponges to protect their rostra while searching for prey along the sea floor (Smolker et al., 1997) and stranding themselves on mud banks to feed on fish (Duffy-Echevarria et al., 2008). The development of new foraging behaviors by bottlenose dolphins has also been impacted by fishing practices, resulting in the development of new foraging tactics targeting the fisheries (e.g., Cantor et al., 2023; Noke & Odell, 2002). While behavioral plasticity may allow bottlenose dolphins to better adapt to changes within their environment (Brakes & Dall, 2016), it may also provide the context for human-wildlife conflict with the potential to negatively impact both humans and wildlife (Woodroffe et al., 2005). One example of a behavior associated with man-made resource exploitation, and conflict between humans and wildlife, is fishing gear depredation, that is, the removal of or damage to, captured fish or bait by marine predators (Zollett & Read, 2006). Depredation has been observed in marine predators, including sharks (e.g., MacNeil et al., 2009), pinnipeds (e.g., Ferrari et al., 2015), and cetaceans (e.g., Zollett & Read, 2006). While depredation is costly for humans, it may allow wild animals to exploit new prey items (e.g., Visser, 2000; Zollett & Read, 2006), consume preferred prey species (e.g., Noke & Odell, 2002; Rechimont et al., 2018), and develop more efficient foraging tactics (e.g., Chávez-Martínez et al., 2022; Díaz López, 2006; Zollett & Read, 2006). Depredation, however, may also come at a cost to the animals by increasing the risk of entanglement in fishing gear (Silva et al., 2002; Werner et al., 2015), the potential ingestion of fishing equipment (Ðuras Gomerčić et al., 2009), and possible retaliation by fishers (Visser, 2000). Jamaica's coastal waters are considered overfished, resulting in changes in species composition from commercially high-valued to less-valued, lower trophic level fish species, and decreases in average fish size and annual catch (Aiken & Kong, 2000; Klomp et al., 2003; Miller et al., 1996). Since at least 2000, fishers in Jamaica have reported depredation by dolphins (Aiken & Pal, 2008) as an additional impact to the fishery, noting that dolphins removed fish from fishing nets and Antillean Z-shaped fish traps (an all wooden-framed structure covered with galvanized wire mesh forming two funnel entrances [Munro et al., 1971]) (Figure 1). The perceived threat to their livelihoods has resulted in some fishers threatening to harm dolphins (Aiken & Pal, 2008; O'Sullivan personal observation). Aiken and Pal's (2008) report of this behavior, however, was based on fisher accounts and did not provide definitive evidence of the described behavior, making it difficult to develop possible mitigation measures. A recent report documenting opportunistic sightings of depredation events (Burge et al., 2023), as well as more systematic studies, may provide insight into the development of this behavior and effective mitigation measures. Here, we report underwater observations of this depredation behavior by common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in Westmoreland, Jamaica. In 2015, Antillean Z-shaped fish traps in Montego Bay, St. James and Bluefields, Westmoreland were monitored using high-definition video cameras (GoPro Hero 3+, GoPro, Inc., CA, USA) deployed by SCUBA divers. The cameras were placed adjacent to (<10 m) the traps and connected to custom-made casings containing alkaline D-cell batteries, allowing up to 20 h of continuous recording (Figure 2). Four cameras (one per trap) were deployed simultaneously every day at two sites along the coast of Jamaica: Montego Bay, St. James (May 16–19, 2015) and Bluefields, Westmoreland (May 21–30 and December 8–17, 2015) in waters with an average depth of 22 and 9 m, respectively, on either sand adjacent to reefs, seagrass beds, or both. Montego Bay, Bluefields and a third site were chosen to represent areas along the north, west, and south coasts of the island, respectively, in areas where depredation had been reported. However, poor weather at the proposed third field site prevented data collection there but allowed for a longer monitoring period in Bluefields in May. Additional data were collected in Bluefields in December in order to document additional instances of depredation. Camera deployment sites were determined after discussions with local fishers in order to identify the areas where depredation was most likely to occur. Fishers gave permission for their traps, and fishing sites, to be used (Figure 3). Video recordings (30 fps, 1920 × 720 or 1920 × 1080 pixel resolution) were visualized at either 2× or 5× the normal speed to detect the presence of dolphins and fishing gear interactions. A total of 1345.5 h of underwater video (Montego Bay: 108.5 h; Bluefields: 1237.0 h) was recorded across the two field seasons at both sites. Of these, only 704.3 h (Montego Bay: 88.5 h; Bluefields: 615.8 h) corresponded to daylight hours and were used for analysis. Technical issues with the camera equipment while monitoring in Montego Bay accounted for the reduced number of hours recorded there. The inspection of video recordings revealed one event of a bottlenose dolphin inspecting a fish trap in Montego Bay, but no depredation took place. In Bluefields, 11 depredation events were recorded, showing at least one bottlenose dolphin interfering with a fish trap. Thirteen events of bottlenose dolphins inspecting traps, without trying to extract fish, were also documented (Table 1). Single dolphins were recorded interacting with the traps in all but two of the depredation events. The other two depredation events occurred with groups of three dolphins. The depredation rate calculated for Bluefields, inclusive of the unsuccessful attempts, was estimated to be 0.011 events/trap/day in May and 0.004 events/trap/day in December. The mean duration dolphins spent with a trap during a depredation event was 165 s (32–378), and the mean amount of time spent inspecting the traps without interaction was 7 s (1–31). Nine of the 11 recorded depredation events involved one dolphin attempting to extract fish from a trap in an upright position. In one instance, one dolphin manipulated the trap into an upright position allowing all three members of the group to attempt to extract fish from the trap. In another event, a single dolphin unsuccessfully attempted to extract fish from a trap that had previously been turned by another individual earlier in the day. The two depredation events that did not require the manipulation of the trap into an upright position included a single dolphin, within a group of three, extracting a fish through the trap's mesh without changing the trap's orientation, and a single dolphin which turned a trap, with a buoy attached to it, on its side. The manipulation of the traps occurred in one of two ways. In a one-step procedure, the dolphin used its rostrum to lift the shortest edge of the trap into an upright position while thrusting its fluke (Figure 4; Video S1). In a two-step procedure, the dolphin used its rostrum to push the longest edge of the trap upwards so that the trap rested on its side, before lifting the trap upwards by pushing the shorter edge into an upright position (Figure 5, Video S2). The former method was used during six of the nine recorded attempts, while the latter method was used during the remaining three. In the case where a float had been attached to the trap, the dolphin pushed the trap on its side but did not attempt the second step. In three cases, a dolphin re-balanced a trap that was about to fall down due to wave surges (e.g., Video S1). After manipulating the trap into an upright position, dolphins swam around the trap, apparently herding the fish inside toward the trap's openings. In three cases, a dolphin re-oriented the trap by rotating it vertically by 180° in order to catch additional fish (e.g., Video S1). At the end of most of the depredation events, the traps were left upright, preventing the catch of additional fish. Unlike the fisher reports documented in Aiken and Pal (2008), no damage to the traps was observed during any of the recorded dolphin interactions, and none of the traps were rolled into deeper waters. While in some cases dolphins appeared to extract all the fish from the trap, there were instances when fish were left in the trap after depredation. Due to the distance between the camera and the fishing gear, it was impossible to confidently ascertain which fish species were extracted, or left in the trap. However, in the opportunistic reports documented in Burge et al. (2023), ocean surgeon (Acanthurus tractus) and tomtate (Haemulon aurolineatum) were observed being taken. The distance between the camera and the traps, as well as the position of the dolphin during the depredation event sometimes made it difficult to determine how the fish were obtained. In most cases, the dolphins appeared to consume the fish once they had exited the trap, either chasing the fish once they had left or grabbing them as soon as they had exited the trap. However, there were some instances where the fish might have been extracted through the mesh of the trap. In most of the depredation events, as well as the instances where dolphins only swam past and inspected the traps, it was difficult to document distinct features for most of the dolphins in order to determine how many distinct individuals had been documented feeding from the traps. One individual, however, had distinctive marks and was documented on three occasions depredating traps, as well as swimming past traps on four separate occasions. This individual was found in both groups of three dolphins and was the dolphin that extracted the fish from the trap without manipulating it, as well as the dolphin that turned the trap upright before the other two dolphins attempted to extract fish. This individual also used both the one- and two-step processes when manipulating the trap. While the quality of the videos and the absence of distinctive marks on some dolphins precluded estimating the number of observed individuals engaged in this behavior, we documented at least two animals depredating fish traps. In seven of the 11 recorded depredation events the sex of the animal engaged in depredation was determined to be male, based on visual inspection of the genital area, the absence of mammary slits, and the position of the genital and anal slits. In the other instances, the sex of the animal could not be determined based on the position of the camera, quality of the video, and the movements of the animal. Bottlenose dolphins have been known to depredate using a variety of fishing methods including gillnets, driftnets, longlines, trammel nets, crab pots, and trawling (e.g., Alexandre et al., 2022; Bonizzoni et al., 2022; Goetz et al., 2014; Noke & Odell, 2002; Pardalou & Tsikliras, 2020; Rechimont et al., 2018; Zollett & Read, 2006). The extraction of fish from Antillean Z-shaped fish traps adds to the diversity of the methods documented across the species' global distribution. Bottlenose dolphins have been reported to possess sophisticated cognitive abilities such as tool use (Smolker et al., 1997), mirror self-recognition (Reiss & Marino, 2001), the ability to understand symbols and other external representations (Herman et al., 1984; Herman & Forestell, 1985), cultural transmission (Krützen et al., 2005), and cooperation when solving a novel task (King et al., 2021; Kuczaj II et al., 2015). Bottlenose dolphin's cognitive abilities may allow them to adapt to localized environmental characteristics within their geographic range, optimizing their foraging success. These cognitive abilities may also facilitate the learning of new behaviors and their spread throughout the population (e.g., Krützen et al., 2005; Wild et al., 2020). For example, Patterson and Mann (2011) found that the use of sponges by some bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia, protected their rostra while accessing fish without swim bladders, found below rubble-laden substrates. This allowed for the improved exploitation of the resources available within their environment. In the case of the dolphins in Jamaica, we propose that the presentation of food-related stimuli, in this case prey fish, reinforced the development of this new foraging tactic. The goal-oriented manipulation exhibited by the observed dolphins indicates that they had previous experience interacting with traps and that this behavior had been learned before. The cases where dolphins re-balanced or re-rotated upright traps suggest that dolphins have a cognitive representation of how the trap should be oriented to facilitate extraction of the fish and that manipulation does not simply follow from a series of blindly executed memorized actions. Bottlenose dolphins are capable of social learning and cultural transmission of behavior, including foraging tactics (e.g., Whitehead & Rendell, 2014; Wild et al., 2020). The observation of a group of three dolphins interacting with a trap (e.g., Video S3) provides the context for social learning (Galef & Giraldeau, 2001; Galef & Laland, 2005) and social facilitation (Clayton, 1978). This suggests that the depredation behavior can be socially transmitted among individuals, has the potential to expand through the population, with patterns determined by social structure at faster rates than from individually learned behaviors (Clayton, 1978), and has a greater chance of persisting in the population (Boyd & Richerson, 1985; Whitehead et al., 2004), if environmental conditions allow for it. Individual learning opportunities also exist as dolphins explore traps in their environment, such as when dolphins encounter upright traps previously manipulated by other individuals. While the development of specialized foraging tactics may be influenced by habitat type (e.g., Patterson & Mann, 2011; Torres & Read, 2009) and the changes observed within those environments (e.g., Donaldson et al., 2012; Noke & Odell, 2002), the transmission of those tactics may occur through observation, either by vertical (mother to calf) (e.g., Krützen et al., 2005), horizontal (through conspecifics of the same generation) (e.g., Donaldson et al., 2012), or oblique transmission (through conspecifics of the different generations) (e.g., Mann et al., 2007). The sex of adult bottlenose dolphins may also determine the type of transmission seen (Mann & Sargeant, 2003). While calves of both sexes may practice foraging behaviors demonstrated by their mothers, male calves are weaned earlier than female calves (Mann & Sargeant, 2003). This may make female bottlenose dolphins more likely to employ their mothers' foraging tactics since they are more exposed to them. Conversely, mother–son associations may decline after weaning and male bottlenose dolphins may instead use foraging tactics transmitted through associations with other male conspecifics that allow them to access opportunistic or easily accessible food sources (Mann & Sargeant, 2003). The identification of single, male, bottlenose dolphins feeding from the traps in this study is consistent with this since male dolphins are more likely to travel by themselves, making it difficult to engage in cooperative foraging strategies (Adimey et al., 2014; Morales-Rincon et al., 2019; Powell & Wells, 2011). However, Burge et al. (2023) documented one instance of what may have been a mother and calf interacting with a trap, with the adult attempting to unsuccessfully turn the trap upright, with no depredation taking place. It may therefore be possible that female dolphins are also involved in depredation and that the behavior is passed on through both horizontal and vertical transmissions (Mann & Sargeant, 2003; Wild et al., 2020). Since the sex of all the animals engaged in depredation in our study could not be identified, further work to assess the sexes of the animals engaged in this behavior may help determine how this behavior is transmitted throughout the population. Observations of dolphins inspecting traps containing fish without engaging in depredation, ignoring larger fish outside of fish traps, and of dolphins abandoning traps with fish inside, suggest that they may be selecting specific fish species (Brotons et al., 2008), selecting specific fish sizes, and that traps may provide an opportunity to access preferred prey species (Rechimont et al., 2018). Overfishing in Jamaican waters has resulted in changes to species composition and fish size. Higher valued commercial species such as snappers (Lutjanidae) and groupers (Serranidae) have been replaced with lower valued commercial species such as surgeonfish (Acanthuridae), parrotfish (Scaridae), and squirrelfish (Holocentridae) (e.g., Aiken & Haughton, 1987; Miller et al., 1996), while the added selective pressure for larger individuals has resulted in decreases in the overall size of the fish on the reef leaving only smaller fish to reproduce (Klomp et al., 2003). With overfishing causing fishers to catch smaller, lower trophic level fish species, this may be placing them in direct competition with bottlenose dolphins since both the fishers and the dolphins may be targeting the same, smaller individuals, within those species. In Jamaican waters, the average total lengths of Acanthuridae and Scaridae species were 100 and 120 mm (Klomp et al., 2003), respectively, and dolphins have been seen targeting A. tractus caught in Z-shaped traps (Burge et al., 2023). The sizes of these fish are consistent with the range of prey sizes (69–640 mm) identified for bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota Bay (Barros & Wells, 1998). This may explain why some of the videos showed larger fish being ignored by the dolphins as they swam past traps. Mignucci-Giannoni et al. (2009) attributed the death of a bottlenose dolphin to asphyxiation from choking on a 492-mm-long black margate (Anisotremus surinamensis), while smaller individuals of the same species were found in its stomach. Since the diet of bottlenose dolphins in Jamaican waters is unknown, these species may be consumed by dolphins but only at smaller sizes, since the larger sizes may be difficult to swallow. The dolphins may also be attracted by the sounds made by targeted fish species. Both A. tractus and H. aurolineatum, which were identified as prey items by Burge et al. (2023), are from families whose recorded species produce sound either through swim bladders, or both pharyngeal teeth and swim bladders, respectively (Fish & Mowbray, 1970). The sounds produced by these mechanisms may help attract the dolphins to the trap through passive listening (Barros & Wells, 1998). Berens McCabe et al. (2010), for example, found that soniferous fish species were disproportionately selected as prey by bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota Bay, Florida, over non-soniferous species, with passive listening for soniferous prey potentially providing an ecological or energetic advantage for the dolphins. Alternatively, acoustic cues provided by both species may also be used by echolocating dolphins to help identify specific prey species (Au et al., 2009). Audio and video recordings documenting the species found in the traps, particularly those being consumed by the dolphins, may help to determine if particular species are being targeted. Even though trap fishing has occurred in Jamaica since the 19th century, and Z-shaped traps were introduced in the 1920s (Hardt, 2009), reports of depredation only began in the early 2000s (Aiken & Pal, 2008). A reduction of preferred prey species caused by the continued overexploitation of Jamaica's marine environment may have enhanced the development of new foraging strategies to access these resources (Powell & Wells, 2011). Depredation may also be occurring because the presence of traps within the habitat has provided dolphins with an opportunity to develop a more efficient foraging tactic allowing them to opportunistically take advantage of trapped prey (e.g., Chávez-Martínez et al., 2022; Díaz López, 2006; Noke & Odell, 2002; Zollett & Read, 2006). While it was difficult to determine the number of individuals engaged in this behavior due to a combination of factors such as water visibility, the quality of the video, the distance of the camera from the depredation event, and the orientation of their bodies with respect to the camera, it is important that further studies try to determine the number of individuals involved, and how widespread the behavior is. Even though it is not currently possible to ascertain what proportion of the population extracts fish from fishing gear, reports of depredation are island-wide (Aiken & Pal, 2008; Burge et al., 2023; O'Sullivan, personal observation). Additional studies will help determine whether the behavior is found throughout the population, or can only be attributed to a few individuals (Mann, 1999). The collection of acoustic recordings and the identification of signature whistles (Janik et al., 2013), in conjunction with the video recordings, for example, may help to determine the number of individuals engaged in depredation at the sites. Once the behavior, and its spread through the population, is better understood, it may be possible to develop mitigation measures that will help minimize the catch lost, and the economic consequences ascribed by the fishers. One possible mitigation measure that could be tested is the addition of underwater buoys to the traps. In one documented instance (Figure 6), a trap with a buoy attached was only turned on its side. Even though the dolphin was still able to extract fish from the trap, the trap began to fall back down in at least two instances, which would allow the trap to continue catching fish. Since the fishers often complain that the traps, when left upright, are unable to catch fish, the use of these buoys may help to reduce the losses they sustain. However, Burge et al. (2023) documented two bottlenose dolphins turning a trap with a rope and possible buoy attached to it. Additional research will have to be done to determine whether differences in the length of the rope or the size/position of the float used may make this method an effective mitigation measure. The use of continuous video recordings has often been used in the terrestrial environment to document the behaviors of several different species, including snakes (Clark et al., 2012), birds (Cunningham & Castro, 2011; Rutz et al., 2007), and primates (Walton et al., 2024) in their natural environments, without influencing or impeding the behaviors being expressed. However, the application of this method to document marine species in the wild has been more limited (e.g., Boom et al., 2012). The use of continuous video recordings, similar to the methods used here, may help to reduce the impacts of weather constraints on direct field observations, allow for the simultaneous monitoring of different individuals in the field, and facilitate the repeated viewing of the captured behaviors (Karnowski et al., 2016; Scheibe et al., 2008). The continued use of video monitoring in Jamaica may help provide insight into the extent to which bottlenose dolphins engage in fish trap depredation. Extended monitoring can reveal whether there is seasonality in depredation activity, if it is concentrated at particular locations, the number of individual dolphins involved, and assist in quantifying the costs to fishers. Photo-identification techniques, and the deployment of multiple cameras closer to the fish traps, may allow for the identification of the individual animals engaged in depredation events and provide insight into the patterns of spread in the population. Identifying which, if any, fish species are preferred, including their energy content and the energetic costs of depredation, may elucidate the advantages gained by fish trap depredation, while a better understanding of how the fish are extracted from the traps can lead to the development of mitigation measures that will minimize the cost to fishers. In conclusion, our observations of this bottlenose dolphin foraging behavior targeting Antillean Z-shaped fish traps support the premise that the dolphins' cognitive abilities have allowed them to exploit resources targeted by Jamaica's fishing industry. The development of this foraging tactic may also enhance their ability to exploit preferred prey species and increase foraging efficiency. While the development of a more efficient foraging tactic, and the ability to exploit an otherwise unavailable resource, or at a lower energetic cost, may prove advantageous for the dolphins (Chávez-Martínez et al., 2022), increased interactions with human activities may have detrimental effects on their population. Fishers in Jamaica routinely complain about the impacts these interactions have had on their livelihoods, with some threatening retaliation (Aiken & Pal, 2008; C. O'Sullivan, personal observation). Given the bottlenose dolphin's protected status under Jamaican law, and that their distribution and population size are unknown (Kenney et al., 2004), efforts need to be taken to better understand the impacts of this foraging tactic and reduce any perceived threats.

https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.224824,Conspecific chemical cues drive density-dependent metabolic suppression independently of resource intake,"ABSTRACT Within species, individuals of the same size can vary substantially in their metabolic rate. One source of variation in metabolism is conspecific density – individuals in denser populations may have lower metabolism than those in sparser populations. However, the mechanisms through which conspecifics drive metabolic suppression remain unclear. Although food competition is a potential driver, other density-mediated factors could act independently or in combination to drive metabolic suppression, but these drivers have rarely been investigated. We used sessile marine invertebrates to test how food availability interacts with oxygen availability, water flow and chemical cues to affect metabolism. We show that conspecific chemical cues induce metabolic suppression independently of food and this metabolic reduction is associated with the downregulation of physiological processes rather than feeding activity. Conspecific cues should be considered when predicting metabolic variation and competitive outcomes as they are an important, but underexplored, source of variation in metabolic traits. Summary: Conspecific chemical cues induce metabolic suppression independently of food, and this metabolic reduction is associated with the downregulation of physiological processes rather than feeding activity.",0c5dd6ad9fe6509c596895205ae2a66e9a3c5a5d,0c5dd6ad9fe6509c596895205ae2a66e9a3c5a5d,0,True,0.9000981450080872,0

Traits are not entirely independent, however: When trade-offs occur, selection on one trait may indirectly act on another. Here we examine how environmentally mediated selection for growth interacts with a trade-off between growth and herbivore defense in experimental aspen stands. We show that even an environmentally fixed trait trade-off can lead to real-time divergence in population genetic composition between environments. The underlying growth–defense trade-off led to an eco-evolutionary dynamic wherein high-competition environments selected for fast-growing trees and thus ultimately selected against herbivore resistance. This discovery reveals how patterns of genetic covariation, coupled with environmental variation, can link ecological and evolutionary processes. All organisms experience fundamental conflicts between divergent metabolic processes. In plants, a pivotal conflict occurs between allocation to growth, which accelerates resource acquisition, and to defense, which protects existing tissue against herbivory. Trade-offs between growth and defense traits are not universally observed, and a central prediction of plant evolutionary ecology is that context-dependence of these trade-offs contributes to the maintenance of intraspecific variation in defense [Züst and Agrawal, Annu. Rev. Plant Biol., 68, 513–534 (2017)]. This prediction has rarely been tested, however, and the evolutionary consequences of growth–defense trade-offs in different environments are poorly understood, especially in long-lived species [Cipollini et al., Annual Plant Reviews (Wiley, 2014), pp. 263–307]. Here we show that intraspecific trait trade-offs, even when fixed across divergent environments, interact with competition to drive natural selection of tree genotypes corresponding to their growth–defense phenotypes. Our results show that a functional trait trade-off, when coupled with environmental variation, causes real-time divergence in the genetic architecture of tree populations in an experimental setting. Specifically, competitive selection for faster growth resulted in dominance by fast-growing tree genotypes that were poorly defended against natural enemies. This outcome is a signature example of eco-evolutionary dynamics: Competitive interactions affected microevolutionary trajectories on a timescale relevant to subsequent ecological interactions [Brunner et al., Funct. Ecol. 33, 7–12 (2019)]. Eco-evolutionary drivers of tree growth and defense are thus critical to stand-level trait variation, which structures communities and ecosystems over expansive spatiotemporal scales.",14c9352609fd2cfb8e78eddf51613281890ad75b,14c9352609fd2cfb8e78eddf51613281890ad75b,0,True,0.970994770526886,0

Associations between phylogenetic relatedness and local community structure are particularly interesting for groups in which many species that span a gradient of phylogenetic divergence occur in potential sympatry. We explored the relationship between evolutionary relatedness and current species co-occurrence among the North American wood-warblers (Aves: Parulidae), a group of songbirds known both for its species diversity and for exhibiting high levels of sympatry at breeding sites. Species co-occurrences were derived from North American Breeding Bird Survey transects comprising 160,000 census points distributed across North America. The nested point-within-transect structure of this survey provides an unusual opportunity to remove larger-scale geographical effects on local community composition and thereby consider patterns of co-occurrence only among regionally sympatric pairs of species. We indexed evolutionary relatedness among all pairs of taxa by genetic distances based on long mitochondrial DNA protein-coding sequences. Most regionally sympatric taxon pairs rarely co-occur at local sites, and the most closely related never exhibit high local co-occurrences, as predicted if past or present competitive effects are strongest for these recently separated lineages. Quantile regression shows that, for a subset of taxa, local co-occurrence does increase with time since common ancestry, and that this apparent relaxation of competitive exclusion is strongest for distantly related species that have differentiated in fundamental ecological and behavioral traits, such as terrestrial vs. arboreal foraging. Comparisons against a null model of species co-occurrence further demonstrate that these patterns occur against a background of phylogenetic niche conservatism: across all phylogenetic distances, sympatric species co-occurred at higher rates than expected by chance, a pattern that might stem from a tendency by these species to show conservatism in their selection of similar general habitat types. Considered in concert, these analyses suggest the simultaneous mediation of local community structure by the ecological similarity of closely related species and by trait divergence among a subset of more distant lineages.",162db2984962256a753df186764f1f41a303e8a9,162db2984962256a753df186764f1f41a303e8a9,0,True,0.9274532794952393,0

In many animals immunity is not fully developed until adulthood but the young still need protection against various sets of pathogens. Thus, bird nestlings are highly dependent on antibodies received from their mother (in the eggs) during their rapid early growth period. The relationship between maternal immunity and the development of neonates' own immunity has been poorly studied. 2. It has been suggested that immune function plays an important part in mediating resource competition between different life-history traits, e.g. growth and reproduction. Maternal investment of antibodies has potentially permanent effects on offspring phenotype. Thus, the trade-offs between the immune function and other important life-history traits in the offspring will also affect the fitness of the mother. 3. Our supplemental feeding experiment in the magpie Pica pica indicates that the immunoglobulin levels of offspring at hatching are dependent on a mother's nutritional condition. In addition, the amount of maternal immunoglobulins transferred to offspring increases along the laying order within a nest. 4. We also found that at the age of 8-10 days the immunoglobulin production of the offspring has already begun. Furthermore, the maternal immunoglobulin levels of the offspring at hatching were positively related to their immunoglobulin levels on day 10. 5. Maternal immunoglobulins did not significantly affect offspring growth, but there was a negative relationship between self-produced immunoglobulins and growth over the first 10 days, indicating a trade-off between these traits. Nestlings' weight, however, had a positive relationship with immunoglobulin production suggesting that the observed trade-off between growth and immunoglobulin production is due to catch-up growth of nestlings with a low hatching weight. We found that within nests nestlings with higher maternal antibody levels had higher survival rate until day 20, but between nests there was an opposite relationship. 6. Evidently, there is a trade-off, in magpies, between maternal resources, immune function and growth, shaping the evolution of maternal investment in offspring immunity.",1b64e5f306ebe5398c72c295a6463b065848eaeb,1b64e5f306ebe5398c72c295a6463b065848eaeb,0,True,0.934723436832428,0

At Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we compiled the first food web quantifying trophic interactions between the majority of co‐occurring woody plant species and their internally feeding insect seed predators. Our study is based on more than 200 000 fruits representing 478 plant species, associated with 369 insect species. Insect host‐specificity was remarkably high: only 20% of seed predator species were associated with more than one plant species, while each tree species experienced seed predation from a median of two insect species. Phylogeny, but not plant traits, explained patterns of seed predator attack. These data suggest that seed predators are unlikely to mediate indirect interactions such as apparent competition between plant species, but are consistent with their proposed contribution to maintaining plant diversity via the Janzen–Connell mechanism.",1fd1ee06e9389ee30027956060f31f282331df01,1fd1ee06e9389ee30027956060f31f282331df01,0,True,0.9628379344940186,0

Condition-specific competition, wherein competitive superiority varies with the abiotic environmental gradient, has been proposed as the major structuring force behind such distributions. However, few studies have elucidated the underlying mechanisms, such as behavioral and demographic processes. We conducted laboratory experiments to examine the effects of temperature on interspecific competition between two stream salmonid fishes, Salvelinus malma and S. leucomaenis. The two species have a largely allopatric altitudinal distribution on Hokkaido Island, Japan, proposed to be the result of temperature-mediated competition. We tested predictions that at a higher temperature (12°C), S. leucomaenis would dominate over S. malma in aggressive interactions, foraging performance, growth, and survival, but become subordinate at a lower temperature (6°C). Indeed, S. leucomaenis initiated a greater number of aggressive acts, attained greater food intake and greater growth, and finally excluded S. malma at the higher temperature. Although the two species initiated a similar number of aggressive acts and foraged equally well at the lower temperature, S. leucomaenis achieved a higher growth rate than S. malma; however, the latter eventually became numerically dominant. Clear competitive release in allopatry occurred for S. malma only at the higher temperature, providing direct evidence of condition-specific asymmetric competition. The lower distribution boundary of S. malma in Hokkaido streams may therefore be determined by temperature-mediated condition-specific competition. However, mechanisms determining the upper distribution boundary of S. leucomaenis could not be fully explained by the competitive results at lower temperature, but required an understanding of how effects of competition interacted with species-specific physiological traits. Thus, species distributions along an environmental gradient cannot be solely explained by a simple model of condition-specific competition without considering mechanistic linkages among behavioral and physiological responses to the environment, resource use, and demographic processes.",209bb24d4917978a92c1d3e36821899959b33359,209bb24d4917978a92c1d3e36821899959b33359,0,True,0.9298284649848938,0

Here we have investigated the genetic (AFLP) and morphological (geometric morphometrics) aspects of the littoral–pelagic axis, a commonly observed resource polymorphism in freshwater fishes of postglacial lakes. We found a large degree of variation in the genetic and morphological divergence between littoral and pelagic perch and roach across Swedish lakes. Although there was evidence of assortative mating (elevated kinship values) in both species, we could not find any significant coupling of morphology and genetic divergence. Instead, there was evidence that the extent of resource polymorphism may be largely caused by phenotypic plasticity. These results suggest that assortative mating, which can lead to genetically determined adaptive divergence, does occur in these species, particularly perch, but not according to genetically fixed morphological traits. The behavioural mechanisms facilitating associative mating need to be investigated to explore the interaction between phenotypic plasticity and adaptive genetic divergence and their roles in diversification. © 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015, 114, 929–940.",26a2297bbb45fcefa48d3f633662f6b0acd23a55,26a2297bbb45fcefa48d3f633662f6b0acd23a55,0,True,0.9451233744621277,0

Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) inhabiting stream reaches with different predation regimes have rapidly evolved divergent life history traits. Here, we investigated the effects of both predation and resource availability on guppy trophic niches by evaluating their gut contents, resource standing stocks, and δ15N and δ13C stable isotopes across five streams during the wet season. We found that guppies from low predation (LP) sites had a consistently higher trophic position and proportion of invertebrates in their guts and assimilate less epilithon than guppies from high predation (HP) sites. Higher trophic position was also associated with lower benthic invertebrate availability. Our results suggest that LP guppies could be more efficient invertebrate consumers, possibly as an evolutionary response to greater intraspecific competition for higher quality food. This may be intensified by seasonality, as wet season conditions can alter resource availability, feeding rates, and the intensity of intraspecific competition. Understanding how guppy diets vary among communities is critical to elucidating the role of niche shifts in mediating the link between environmental change and the evolution of life histories.",2b6e7fade1df25e10afca55a0fc82a25c957d0db,2b6e7fade1df25e10afca55a0fc82a25c957d0db,0,True,0.9823307394981384,0

Asynarchus larvae pre- dominate in temporary wetlands and are aggressive intraguild predators on Limnephilus larvae, which only predominate in permanent basins with salamanders. We first conducted a field experiment in mesocosms (cattle tanks) to quantify the predatory effects of different life stages of salamanders on the two caddisfly species. Two life stages of the salamanders (larvae and paedomorphs) preferentially preyed on Asynarchus relative to Limnephilus. Subsequent laboratory experiments revealed that high Asynarchus activity rates and rela- tively ineffective antipredatory behaviors led to higher salamander detection and attack rates compared to Limnephilus. In a second field experiment (full factorial for presence and absence of each of the three species), we found that salamander predation on Asynarchus had an indirect positive effect on Limnephilus: survival was higher in the presence of salamanders + Asynarchus than with just Asynarchus. In the laboratory we compared the predatory effects of salamanders with and without their mouths sewn shut and found the observed indirect positive effect on Limnephilus survival to be mainly the result of reduced numbers of Asynarchus rather than salamander-induced changes in Asynarchus behavior. We argue that indirect effects of predator-predator interactions on shared prey will be mainly density-mediated and not trait-mediated when one of the predators (in this case, Asynarchus) is under strong selection for rapid growth and therefore does not modify foraging behaviors in response to the other predator. The reciprocal dominance of Lim- nephilus and Asynarchus in habitats with and without salamanders probably reflects a trade- off between competitive superiority and vulnerability to predation. The high activity levels and aggressiveness that enable Asynarchus to complete development in temporary habitats result in strong asymmetric competition (via intraguild predation) with Limnephilus. In permanent habitats these same behaviors increase Asynarchus vulnerability to salamander predation, which indirectly benefits Limnephilus. This and previous work implicate sala- manders as keystone predators that exert a major influence on the composition of benthic and planktonic assemblages in subalpine wetlands.",2cd76c19c7b9f9783efb8239b9c38f350bf8dbbb,2cd76c19c7b9f9783efb8239b9c38f350bf8dbbb,0,True,0.9834514260292053,0
https://doi.org/10.1086/408437,"The Comparative Evolutionary Biology of the Sibling Species, Drosophila melanogaster and D. Simulans","1. D. melanogaster and D. simulans are sibling species; they are morphologically almost identical and genetically very similar. Whereas their sexual behavior patterns are qualitatively similar, hybrids are rarely produced and when they are, they are sterile. 2. Although not all data are in agreement, D. melanogaster generally exhibits more chromosomal, enzyme, and protein polymorphism than does D. simulans. Utilizin this relationship, as well as arguments presented in the literature, one can argue for an association between genetic variability and level of ecological heterogeneity. This association is found for two major environmental variables, temperature and light dependence. 3. On a seasonal basis, D. melanogaster achieves large population numbers early in the summer, as D. simulans does in the autumn. The ratio of D. melanogaster to D. simulans increases with temperature and more importantly, with temperature fluctuation. Macroenvironmental temperature is an important factor involved in numerical changes within the two species. Both species from Brisbane, Queensland, are genetically heterogeneous for resistance to desiccation, with additive genetic effects and directional dominance for resistance, whereas at Melbourne, Victoria, D. melanogaster is similar, but the genetic architecture of D. simulans is additive only. Desiccation resistance in the D. simulans Melbourne population varies cyclically on an annual basis but not in the other populations-apparently different genotypes are selected differentially at different times of the year. Between-species generalizations, as in (2) above, are therefore made difficult because of variations within species. 4. From collections at a vineyard and maturation wine cellar coupled with subsequent laboratory experiments, it is clear that an environment in which D. melanogaster occurs exclusive of D. simulans is one of an alcohol-associated resource. On the other hand, in certain places D. simulans has displaced D. melanogaster, for reasons as yet unknown. 5. In the laboratory, a number of experiments at the intraspecific and interspecific levels show differences in fitness-associated traits, such as viability at different stages of the life cycle, oviposition sites, and pupation sites. The results are difficult to interpret, often being dependent upon strain, temperature, or level of competition. Studies over a series of temperatures assessing fitness parameters for many strains of both species are needed before extrapolation to the natural environment is possible. The same problem occurs when population-cage competition experiments betweeen the two species are considered, although some of these experiments have shown that competition itself is controlled by natural selection. 6. The differences between the two species are, in general, quantitative rather than qualitative, so that, with the exception of alcohol, both species use rather similar environmental resources. The potential for rapid increases in the spring suggests that both species are more r strategists than K strategists. In the wild, while some niches, such as alcohol-associated resources, can be defined, it is imperative to define the resources used in nature in order to achieve a more complete comparative evolutionary biology of the two species. The value of the two species in linking behavior, ecology, and genetics is only just now being realized after over half a century of studying them exclusively in various laboratory containers.",32f6e54727da002c8487406b2f6451d037afe676,32f6e54727da002c8487406b2f6451d037afe676,0,True,0.9850644469261169,0
https://doi.org/10.14264/7F62E8F,Testing the processes required for coexistence mediated by spatially varying environments,"One of the fundamental questions in community ecology is how diverse biological communities are able persist through time. Ultimately, the maintenance of species diversity is dependent on the relative magnitude of the mechanisms which drive local extinction and those that prevent it. Accordingly, considerable effort has been invested over several decades into understanding where, when and to what extent these mechanisms operate in different ecological systemsHowever, to date, most empirical studies of diversity maintenance have focused on processes occurring at small, environmentally homogenous spatial scales. Nevertheless, theory suggests that spatial variation in the environment occurring at larger spatial scales, a ubiquitous features of natural ecosystems, can interact with differences in species’ ecophysiology to promote coexistence when species’ growth, survival and biotic interactions respond to the spatial environment in different ways. Thus, rather than averaging across spatial variation, there is an imperative to understand whether niche differentiation across spatial heterogeneity can provide the conditions necessary for stable coexistence in biological communities. My thesis advances our understanding of diversity maintenance in natural ecosystems by empirically testing key requirements of the spatial coexistence mechanisms described in Chesson’s modern coexistence theory.The challenge of explaining how diversity is maintained in biological communities is particularly acute for plants which, as primary producers, compete for just a handful of resources including light, soil nutrients and moisture. My thesis utilises field and laboratory experimental studies to investigate key requirements of spatial coexistence in the annual plant understorey of the York gum – jam woodlands, a woodland occurring in southwest Western Australia characterized by an overstorey of York gum (Eucalyptus loxophleba) and jam (Acacia acuminata). In Chapter 1, I review the contribution of the modern coexistence theoretical framework to our present understanding of how diversity is maintained in biological communities, focusing on variation-dependent coexistence mechanisms and in particular the spatial storage effect. I then establish the motivation of my thesis by highlighting important knowledge gaps including, principally, a paucity of empirical studies testing the key requirements of coexistence mediated by spatial variation.Two of the major requirements of the spatial storage effect are that: (1) species have unique vital rate responses to their spatial environment and that, when abundant, (ii) species experience stronger competition in the environmental patches where they perform better (i.e. positive environment-competition covariance). Thus, In Chapter 2, Requirements for the spatial storage effect are weakly evident for common species in natural annual plant assemblages, I use a neighbour removal experiment in ambiently-occurring annual plant assemblages to test how 11 focal species’ fecundity in the presence and absence of competition varies across a variety of measurable environmental gradients. Species-specific fecundity responses to the environment were not strongly apparent but were found for five out of eleven focal species. In addition, despite finding strong evidence for intra-specific competition for the majority of focal species, positive covariance between the favourability of the environment and the strength of competition was only found for one species. My findings suggest that positive environment-competition covariance may not be as common as expected for abundant species, indicating that coexistence in the York gum – jam woodlands annual understorey may not be strongly regulated by the spatial storage effect, at least when mediated by fecundity alone.In addition to fecundity, annual plant demography is also strongly regulated by seed bank dynamics. Species-specific differentiation in the rate of dormancy alleviation and germination across spatial gradients may therefore promote coexistence. Thus, in Chapter 3, Variable seed bed microsite conditions and light influence germination in Australian winter annuals, I test the light requirements in vitro of seeds for twelve focal species buried for seven months in seed banks across two orthogonal environmental gradients. I hypothesized that the seed bank conditions experienced prior to the arrival of germination-inducing rainfall, the light conditions experienced in vitro and their interaction may differentiate species’ germination niche. I found that six out of the twelve focal species exhibited significant, positive germination responses to light although the magnitude of this response varied among species. Two focal species also exhibited unique germination responses to the amount of canopy cover while in the seed bank, although there was limited evidence that seed bank conditions interacted with light to influence species’ germination response. My findings suggest that species’ germination strategy, determined jointly by environmental cues experienced before and during germination, may be an axis over which niche differentiation occurs across space.In Chapter 4, Trait-mediated demographic responses to spatial heterogeneity are present but weak in a diverse annual plant community, I expand upon the findings from Chapter 2 and 3 by testing whether twelve focal species exhibit unique responses to variation in environmental patch conditions across multiple vital rates and their intrinsic growth rate in the absence of biotic interactions. To do this, I conducted a sowing experiment to test species’ responses in common gardens across environmental gradients known to influence community turnover in the York gum woodlands.  I then use the relative light requirements for germination observed in Chapter 3, among other seed and vegetative functional traits, to test whether species’ ecophysiological strategies predict the strength and magnitude of their environmental responses. Ultimately, I found limited evidence for species-specific responses to the environment, but this depended on the vital rate being investigated and whether I used an approach which implicitly or explicitly accounted for measurable gradients in the abiotic environment. The ability of functional traits to predict species’ demographic responses depended on the vital rate and the environmental gradient, but I found that the magnitude of the change in species’ probability of survival along a gradient of soil fertility was dependent on species’ position along multiple trait axes. In addition, variation in species’ intrinsic growth rate responses to soil fertility were significantly predicted by their position along a trade-off axis between high specific leaf area and high leaf dry matter content. My findings demonstrate that species’ intrinsic demographic responses to spatial heterogeneity are relatively weak which suggests that there is limited opportunity for coexistence via fluctuation-dependent mechanisms in this system. Despite limited variation in species’ demographic responses to the environment, however, I demonstrate that functional traits are a useful tool for predicting species’ fitness across spatially heterogenous landscapes. In Chapter 5, I reflect upon Chapters 2-4 by first discussing the contribution of my research to our understanding of the necessary prerequisites for coexistence in spatially varying environments. Based on my findings, I then propose a series of future research questions and elaborate on how these questions may be addressed.",337d8de8a12e8ff1bd74c25022c9256aba3ee9fd,337d8de8a12e8ff1bd74c25022c9256aba3ee9fd,0,True,0.9982998371124268,0
https://doi.org/10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.1584652.V1,Response of fish biota to dams in the Lower Colorado River Basin: empirical findings and utility for predicting responses to climate and water use change,"Over the past century, development of the Colorado River Basin for water resources changed a dynamic river into a managed system. Seasonality in flow, temperature, and turbidity is reduced, and formerly riverine habitats are now reservoirs. These changes have played out in the fish fauna. Native species have declined and non-natives have increased. The key alteration, relative to the past, is increased competition and predation, especially at juvenile stages, which is likely mediated by more stable flow and resource regimes. A dataset (SONFISHES) assembled by W. L. Minckley and covering 150 years of fish occurrence in the Lower Colorado River (below Glen Canyon Dam) has provided insight into patterns in extirpation among native fishes and range expansion among non-native fishes. Several studies have combined these data with measures of extinction risk to explain how range fragmentation and species’ traits correlate with observed extinctions or threats in native species. Another study analyzed range shifts within a strategy space of potential fish life histories (originally introduced by K. O. Winemiller and K. A. Rose) to understand how human activity has created and removed ecological niches. Together, these studies support a causal link between environmental and faunal change. This strongly suggests that continuing the status quo will result in further extirpation and extinction of native fishes. I argue, however, that current knowledge is not yet sufficient to quantitatively forecast the magnitude and timescale of the response in fish biodiversity to any projected future environment. Such forecasting requires a model that quantitatively relates the environment to persistence in the strategy-space of fish life histories. Unfortunately, we do not need such a model to make the qualitative prediction: threatened “big-river” fishes will eventually go extinct without intervention.",36cfb1b19546e48df9ca93b49ceffb61a794592d,36cfb1b19546e48df9ca93b49ceffb61a794592d,0,True,0.9799970388412476,0

In this chapter, we focus on the ecological side of nonallopatric speciation: Under what ecological conditions is speciation promoted by natural selection? What are the appropriate tools to identify speciation-prone ecological systems? For speciation to occur, a population must have the potential to become polymorphic (i.e., it must harbor heritable variation). Moreover, this variation must be under disruptive selection that favors extreme phenotypes at the cost of intermediate ones. With disruptive selection, a genetic polymorphism can be stable only if selection is frequency dependent (Pimm 1979; see Chapter 3). Some appropriate form of frequency dependence is thus an ecological prerequisite for nonallopatric speciation. Frequency-dependent selection is ubiquitous in nature. It occurs, among many other examples, in the context of resource competition (Christiansen and Loeschcke 1980; see Box 4.1), predator–prey systems (Marrow et al. 1992), multiple habitats (Levene 1953), stochastic environments (Kisdi and Meszena 1993; Chesson 1994), asymmetric competition (Maynard Smith and Brown 1986), mutualistic interactions (Law and Dieckmann 1998), and behavioral conflicts (Maynard Smith and Price 1973; Hofbauer and Sigmund 1990). The theory of adaptive dynamics is a framework devised to model the evolution of continuous traits driven by frequency-dependent selection. It can be applied to various ecological settings and is particularly suitable for incorporating ecological complexity. The adaptive dynamic analysis reveals the course of long-term evolution expected in a given ecological scenario and, in particular, shows whether, and under which conditions, a population is expected to evolve toward a state in which disruptive selection arises and promotes speciation. To achieve analytical tractability in ecologically complex models, many adaptive dynamic models (and much of this chapter) suppress genetic complexity with the assumption of clonally reproducing phenotypes (also referred to as strategies or traits). This enables the efficient identification of interesting features of the engendered selective pressures that deserve further analysis from a genetic perspective.",38075e35e63af30455d6edcab9af03e913e9f501,38075e35e63af30455d6edcab9af03e913e9f501,0,True,0.9084146618843079,0

Their ability to colonise them and thrive depends on life‐history traits including fecundity, dormancy and dispersal ability. The effects of these traits on species distribution, abundance and community assembly have been extensively studied in fragmented landscapes. However, their consequences for genetic diversity and connectivity in local populations remain largely unknown. We investigated the genetic population structure and diversity of Curculio elephas and Curculio glandium (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), two sympatric acorn weevils with contrasting life‐history strategies, in a landscape with mature oak stands and plots of new expanding forests. Using a fragment of a mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 and nuclear DNA (80 single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]), we found that gene flow between populations was significantly weaker in the poor disperser C. elephas, especially in isolated new forests. However, genetic neutrality tests did show population expansion in C. elephas, which suffers frequent population bottlenecks (probably linked to extended dormancy) and is a poor coloniser of isolated new forests. However, its greater fecundity allows it to recovery quickly if the number of reproductive individuals falls. Its populations are thus larger but genetically less diverse than those of C. glandium Within foraging guilds, the most fecund species will outcompete the others under a context of constrained dispersal. Hence, new landscapes of expanding forests represent a good opportunity for more mobile but less fecund species to colonise new habitats and so be temporarily released from competition.",3868b5c650f9875429bbf26afb8aa1301300ab72,3868b5c650f9875429bbf26afb8aa1301300ab72,0,True,0.9799367189407349,0

Tropical Tree Growth and Its Response to Climate Anomalies Is Mediated by Neighbourhood Hierarchy and Dissimilarity in Carbon‐ and Water‐Related Traits,"ABSTRACT Taxonomic diversity effects on forest productivity and response to climate extremes range from positive to negative, suggesting a key role for complex interactions among neighbouring trees. To elucidate how neutral interactions, hierarchical competition and resource partitioning between neighbours' shape tree growth and climate response in a highly diverse Amazonian forest, we combined 30 years of tree censuses with measurements of water‐ and carbon‐related traits. We modelled individual tree growth response to climate and neighbourhood to disentangle the relative effect of neighbourhood densities, trait hierarchies and dissimilarities. While neighbourhood densities consistently decreased growth, trait dissimilarity increased it, and both had the potential to influence climate response. Greater water conservatism provided a competitive advantage to focal trees in normal years, but water–spender neighbours reduced this effect in dry years. By underlining the importance of density and trait‐mediated neighbourhood interactions, our study offers a way towards improving predictions of forest dynamics.",392407c5f3c35e8063ac9c4b9aaec6a71886de98,392407c5f3c35e8063ac9c4b9aaec6a71886de98,0,True,0.9554720520973206,0

Here, various aspects of phenotypic and life-history variation of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L., brown trout Salmo trutta L., and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.) are reviewed. While many strategies and tactics are commonly used by these species, there are also differences in their ecology and population dynamics that result in a variety of interesting and diverse topics that are challenging for future research. Atlantic salmon display considerable phenotypic plasticity and variability in life-history characters ranging from fully freshwater resident forms, where females can mature at approximately 10 cm in length, to anadromous populations characterised by 3–5 sea-winter (5SW) salmon. Even within simple 1SW populations, 20 or more spawning life-history types can be identified. Juveniles in freshwater can use both fluvial and lacustrine habitats for rearing, and while most smolts migrate to sea during the spring, fall migrations occur in some populations. At sea, some salmon undertake extensive oceanic migrations while other populations stay within the geographical confines of areas such as the Baltic Sea. At the other extreme are those that reside in estuaries and return to freshwater to spawn after spending only a few months at sea. The review of information on the diversity of life-history forms is related to conservation aspects associated with Atlantic salmon populations and current trends in abundance and survival. Brown trout is indigenous to Europe, North Africa and western Asia, but was introduced into at least 24 countries outside Europe and now has a world-wide distribution. It exploits both fresh and salt waters for feeding and spawning (brackish), and populations are often partially migratory. One part of the population leaves and feeds elsewhere, while another part stays as residents. In large, complex systems, the species is polymorphic with different size morphs in the various parts of the habitat. Brown trout feed close to the surface and near shore, but large individuals may move far offshore. The species exhibits ontogenetic niche shifts partly related to size and partly to developmental rate. They switch when the amount of surplus energy available for growth becomes small with fast growers being younger and smaller fish than slow growers. Brown trout is an opportunistic carnivore, but individuals specialise at least temporarily on particular food items; insect larvae are important for the young in streams, while littoral epibenthos in lakes and fish are most important for large trout. The sexes differ in resource use and size. Females are more inclined than males to become migratory and feed in pelagic waters. Males exploit running water, near-shore and surface waters more than females. Therefore, females feed more on zooplankton and exhibit a more uniform phenotype than males. The Arctic charr is the northernmost freshwater fish on earth, with a circumpolar distribution in the Holarctic that matches the last glaciation. Recent mtDNA studies indicate that there are five phylogeographic lineages (Atlantic, Arctic, Bering, Siberian and Acadian) that may be of Pleistocene origin. Phenotypic expression and ecology are more variable in charr than in most fish. Weights at maturation range from 3 g to 12 kg. Population differences in morphology and coloration are large and can have some genetic basis. Charr live in streams, at sea and in all habitats of oligotrophic lakes, including very deep areas. Ontogenetic habitat shifts between lacustrine habitats are common. The charr feed on all major prey types of streams, lakes and near-shore marine habitats, but has high niche flexibility in competition. Cannibalism is expressed in several cases, and can be important for developing and maintaining bimodal size distributions. Anadromy is found in the northern part of its range and involves about 40, but sometimes more days in the sea. All charr overwinter in freshwater. Partial migration is common, but the degree of anadromy varies greatly among populations. The food at sea includes zooplankton and pelagic fish, but also epibenthos. Polymorphism and sympatric morphs are much studied. As a prominent fish of glaciated lakes, charr is an important species for studying ecological speciation by the combination of field studies and experiments, particularly in the fields of morphometric heterochrony and comparative behaviour.",3a07dc17129ec541c9640ee332e90083f2dc5ff4,3a07dc17129ec541c9640ee332e90083f2dc5ff4,0,True,0.9849825501441956,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/J.2007.0030-1299.15430.X,Architectural and growth traits differ in effects on performance of clonal plants: an analysis using a field-parameterized simulation model,"Individual traits are often assumed to be linked in a straightforward manner to plant performance and processes such as population growth, competition and community dynamics. However, because no trait functions in isolation in an organism, the effect of any one trait is likely to be at least somewhat contingent on other trait values. Thus, to the extent that the suite of trait values differs among species, the magnitude and even direction of correlation between values of any particular trait and performance is likely to differ among species. Working with a group of clonal plant species, we assessed the degree of this contingency and therefore the extent to which the assumption of simple and general linkages between traits and performance is valid. To do this, we parameterized a highly calibrated, spatially explicit, individual-based model of clonal plant population dynamics and then manipulated one trait at a time in the context of realistic values of other traits for each species. The model includes traits describing growth, resource allocation, response to competition, as well as architectural traits that determine spatial spread. The model was parameterized from a short-term (3 month) experiment and then validated with a separate, longer term (two year) experiment for six clonal wetland sedges, Carex lasiocarpa, Carex sterilis, Carex stricta, Cladium mariscoides, Scirpus acutus and Scirpus americanus. These plants all co-occur in fens in southeastern Michigan and represent a spectrum of clonal growth forms from strong clumpers to runners with long rhizomes. 
 
 
 
Varying growth, allocation and competition traits produced the largest and most uniform responses in population growth among species, while variation in architectural traits produced responses that were smaller and more variable among species. This is likely due to the fact that growth and competition traits directly affect mean ramet size and number of ramets, which are direct components of population biomass. In contrast, architectural and allocation traits determine spatial distribution of biomass; in the long run, this also affects population size, but its net effect is more likely to be mediated by other traits. Such differences in how traits affect plant performance are likely to have implications for interspecific interactions and community structure, as well as on the interpretation and usefulness of single trait optimality models.",4a0b2037c61bbfb5c6c6d9747adc861cb6478fd6,4a0b2037c61bbfb5c6c6d9747adc861cb6478fd6,0,True,0.9651394486427307,0
https://doi.org/10.1101/523720,Eco-Evolutionary Feedbacks Between Predator’s Linkage Disequilibrium and Prey Densities Maintain Diversity,"Diversity occurs at multiple scales. Within a single population, there is diversity in genotypes and phenotypes. At a larger scale, within ecological communities, there is diversity in species. There have been a number of studies to investigate how diversity at these two scales influence each other through what has been termed eco-evolutionary feedbacks. Here we study a three-species ecological module called apparent competition, in which the predator is evolving in a trait that determines its interaction with two prey species. Unlike previous studies on apparent competition, which employed evolutionary frameworks with greatly simplified genetics, we study a multilocus eco-evolutionary model in which the predator’s evolving trait is determined by two diallelic loci. We ask how eco-evolutionary feedbacks with these two loci affect the coexistence of the prey species and the maintenance of polymorphisms within the predator species. In doing so, we uncover a novel eco-evolutionary feedback between the prey species and the linkage disequilibrium of the two loci of the predator. Through a stability analysis, we demonstrate how these feedbacks affect polymorphisms at both loci and, among others, may generate stable cycling.",4cb1056c4a5b55c1c71f62079100286349750ab5,4cb1056c4a5b55c1c71f62079100286349750ab5,0,True,0.9960702061653137,0
https://doi.org/10.18174/466162,How plants balance competitive growth and defence : an analysis of virtual plants in dynamic interactions,"Plants grow in dynamic environments where their fitness is determined by a multitude of biotic and abiotic factors in the environment. These environments house complex webs of interactions in which plants must compete with neighbours for limited resources such as light, while having to defend against a multitude of heterotrophic organisms such as insect herbivores. Plants respond to cues related to neighbour presence and herbivore damage with a suite of induced shade avoidance and defence responses, respectively. One of the signals that interlinks these shade avoidance and defence responses is the red to far-red ratio (R:FR), which is a neighbour detection cue that induces shade avoidance responses and downregulates direct defence responses. This physiological linkage has been hypothesised as a mechanism that balances a resource allocation trade-off by promoting resource acquisition through competitive growth, at the expense of defence. However, the optimal expression of traits related to competitive growth and defence are not only dependent on biotic environmental factors, but also on interactions with the plant and herbivore communities. The aim of this thesis was to elucidate how ecological interactions shape the optimal balance between the acquisition and protection of resources. To reach this objective, I used a functional-structural plant (FSP) modelling approach to simulate physiological mechanisms that interact with the environment, how these mechanisms drive ecological interactions between plants and herbivores, and the evolutionary dynamics that arise from these interactions. In the general introduction (chapter 1), the linkage between competitive growth and defence is introduced from physiological, ecological and evolutionary perspectives, and FSP modelling is introduced as a tool to study the balance between competitive growth and defence. In this thesis, I describe and utilise two FSP models; an FSP model of Brassica nigra that focusses on detailed physiological responses and is parameterised and validated using field and greenhouse experiments, and an FSP model of a generic dicotyledon that focusses on evolutionary dynamics. In chapter 2, I outline my view on using FSP modelling to study interactions between the plant and herbivore communities and accentuate the importance of considering these interactions in a dynamic environment. In this chapter, I propose four alternative hypotheses to the origin of the physiological linkage between shade avoidance and defence responses that go beyond the perspective of resource allocation trade-offs between growth and defence. The downregulation of direct defence by a low R:FR cue may function to (i) focus defence on valuable tissues, (ii) deter specialist herbivores, (iii) control interactions within the insect herbivore community or (iv) prevent the emission of volatile cues to which neighbouring plants may respond. Chapter 3 presents an FSP model of B. nigra that combines mechanistic simulation of plant growth, shade avoidance responses and herbivore feeding, which are parameterised and validated using field and greenhouse experiments. This model is used to analyse the impact of herbivore feeding at different locations within the plant that relate to herbivore specialisation on plant fitness in a dynamic environment where plants compete for light. This analysis shows that herbivore damage had a larger effect on plant fitness when plants were competing for light and when the damage was directed at young leaves at the top of the canopy. Chapter 4 expands on the FSP model presented in chapter 3 with the addition of plant defence, and is used to analyse how the direct costs (e.g. metabolic costs) and benefits of defence as well as indirect costs and benefits of defence imposed through ecological interactions impact plant fitness. This analysis shows that ecological costs of defence imposed by inter-genotypic competition is the strongest determinant of plant fitness, amplifying size differences resulting from differences in defence investment. Additionally, the model shows that the benefit of plant defence relies on reducing herbivore damage rather than dispersing herbivore damage away from young leaves and towards older leaves that are of less value to the plant. Chapter 5 expands on the FSP model presented in chapter 4 with the addition of R:FR mediation of plant defence, to analyse the function of this physiological regulation from the perspective of simple versus competitive optimisation (e.g. mono-stands vs mixtures). The model results show that plant-level defence investment was a strong determinant of plant fitness, and that leaf-level mediation of plant defence by R:FR may provide an additional fitness benefit in high plant densities. Furthermore, the model shows that the optimal plant-level defence expression does not monotonically decrease with plant density. This indicates that R:FR mediation of defence alone is not sufficient to optimise plant-level defence between densities, as R:FR does monotonically decrease with plant density. Chapter 6 presents a new FSP model that simulates the evolutionary dynamics of a plant population, driven by competition for light and nitrogen in combination with herbivore damage. This evolutionary FSP model is used to analyse how optimal biomass allocation patterns changed with plant density, nitrogen availability and herbivore damage, and how these factors impact the optimal balance between the acquisition and protection of resources. The model results conform with the functional equilibria described by optimal partitioning theory (OPT), which predicts an increase in biomass allocation towards plant parts that partake in the acquisition of a limiting resource. The model further shows that optimal defence levels negatively correlate with nitrogen availability, and positively correlate with plant defence if an increase in plant density decreases the nitrogen availability per plant. This chapter concludes that the adaptive value of plant defence is dependent on the availability of, and competition for both above- and belowground resources. In the general discussion (chapter 7), I discuss the concepts and results presented in chapters 2-6 with respect to the main objective specified in the general introduction (chapter 1). First, I discuss how ecological interactions in a dynamic environment shape growth-defence integration and the challenges and opportunities of using FSP models to simulate these dynamic environments. To illustrate this I present additional simulations that show the effect of a variable plant density on optimal stem allocation, which indicates selection for a high density phenotype. Second, I discuss the role and viability of tolerance as an alternative to plant defence, which highlights the importance of modelling form and function when studying growth-defence integration. Third, I discuss the importance of considering herbivore community dynamics when studying growth-defence integration. To illustrate this importance I present additional simulations that show how specialist herbivores select against taxon-specific forms of defence expression, while generalist herbivores select for overexpression of taxon-specific forms of defence. Fourth, I discuss how considering multiple resources may change the optimal balance between the acquisition and protection of resources. Finally, I present my view on the future perspectives for FSP models of growth and defence, discussing the integration of multiple resources, neighbour detection cues, and dynamics resulting from a complex representation of plant and herbivore communities.",516fd7866bfdf1925d5b3e9bb1dbc7259647a3ac,516fd7866bfdf1925d5b3e9bb1dbc7259647a3ac,0,True,0.9624235033988953,0

Description This dissertation provides a four-part synopsis of the methodology, results, and conclusions of an integrated set of experiments designed to explore the ecology of inducible trophic polymorphisms (ITPs). These experiments were conducted using isogenic populations of the polymorphic freshwater hymenostome ciliate, Tetrahymena vorax Kidder, in combination with other protozoa, bacteria, algae, and micro-invertebrates. Chapter 1 addresses the autecological significance of ITPs, revealing some of their potential costs and benefits to individuals in the context of competition under varying resource regimes. Chapter 2 demonstrates how ITPs can give rise to novel trait-mediated indirect interactions that affect community structure and population dynamics. Chapter 3 elucidates the extent to which the population dynamics of species exhibiting ITPs are affected by the trophic complexity of their habitat. Chapter 4 presents a detailed review of indirect offenses, a versatile adaptive strategy that ITPs can give rise to where inducing agents are symbionts. The contents of these chapters provide unique insights into the link between ITPs and related phenomena – such as cannibalism, intraguild predation, omnivory, and expanded diet breadth – and open new avenues of inquiry regarding the importance of the genetic and functional diversity of natural communities.

https://doi.org/10.1111/plb.12635,Mutualism between co-occurring plant species in South Africa's Mediterranean climate heathland is mediated by birds.,"Interactions among plant species via pollinators vary from competitive to mutualistic and can influence the probability of stable coexistence of plant species. We aimed to determine the nature of the interaction via flower visitors between Leucospermum conocarpodendron and Mimetes fimbriifolius, two shrubs in the Proteaceae that share many ecological traits and coexist on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. To assess the extent of pollinator sharing we analysed nectar properties and recorded the pollinator fauna, their behaviour and contribution to seed set. To test for competition via interspecific pollen transfer, we recorded the movement patterns of pollinators and quantified pollen loads. To determine the effect of co-flowering on visitation rates we recorded visits in stands that varied in the density of the two species. We found that the species produce similar rewards and share pollinating Cape Sugarbirds (Promerops cafer). Interspecific pollen transfer is avoided by placing pollen on different parts of the bird. Both species are visited by nectar-thieving Orange-breasted Sunbirds (Anthobaphes violacea). Insects and autonomous self-pollination contributed little to seed set. Pollinator visits increased with conspecific density in both species, and the slope of the increase was steepest in the presence of high densities of the co-occurring plant species. Nectar thief visits also increased with conspecific density in both species, but the slope declined with increasing density of the co-occurring species. Co-occurrence enhanced pollinator visits and alleviated nectar robbing in both plant species, consistent with mutualisms. Mutualism within a trophic level is unusual, but may help to explain the stable coexistence of ecologically similar species.",58d5d2a03713c71b40d99b820b75b78f313e0755,58d5d2a03713c71b40d99b820b75b78f313e0755,0,True,0.9897891879081726,0
https://doi.org/10.7287/PEERJ.PREPRINTS.1646V1,Relationships between taxonomic and functional diversity: insights into assembly processes,"Among the potential indicators of biodiversity, those based on the functional traits of species are interesting because they measure the aspects of diversity that potentially affect community assembly and function. However, trait-based approaches are still rarely considered and little is known about the degree to which taxonomic diversity (TD) and functional diversity (FD) are correlated. Yet, this relationship is thought to depend on the extent of ecological redundancy within the assemblage, i.e. the number of taxonomically distinct species that exhibit similar ecological functions. In this study, we characterized taxonomic and functional diversity within and between two marine habitats (rocky shore vs mudflats) under human-induced disturbances. Models were also used to test whether the relationship between TD and FD differed according to the indices used to characterize them. We found little effect of human disturbance on the shape of the TD-FD relationship, whereas communities of the mudflat appeared to be less redundant than those of rocky shore. This could be explained by the assembly rules of ecosystems: biotic filtering (competition and resource partitioning) reduces redundancy by selecting for functionally dissimilar species, whereas abiotic filtering increases redundancy by selecting for similar species sharing adaptations to a particular environment. The rocky shore environment is characterized by heterogeneity that allows the formation of distinct ecological niches that can be colonized by similar species: the abiotic filtering does not limit the redundancy permitted by habitat. Conversely, in the more homogeneous environment of mudflat, the biotic filter mitigates redundancy. Trait-mediated abiotic filtering appears to play an important role in community assembly in complex habitats, whereas the relative importance of competitive exclusion appears to be greater in homogeneous habitats.",5eb27184e75eb15bacbf611aedfcb7f427853686,5eb27184e75eb15bacbf611aedfcb7f427853686,0,True,0.9749029278755188,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/9780470015902.A0021216,Nonconsumptive Effects of Predators and Trait‐Mediated Indirect Effects,"Phenotypic plasticity in species’ traits is ubiquitous across taxa and habitats. This plasticity can affect the qualitative and quantitative nature of species interactions and thereby affect food webs. Empirical work has focused on predator–prey interactions, in part because most prey respond to predator presence through a suite of traits that reduce risk. These responses can incur costs in fitness correlates (e.g. growth and survival) of the prey, i.e. are nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) of predators. Further, these responses can lead to indirect effects transmitted through the prey to other species in the food web, termed trait-mediated indirect effects (TMIEs). NCEs and TMIEs have been demonstrated in a wide range of communities and across diverse taxa. These effects can contribute substantially to the influence of predators (including through competition, trophic cascades and keystone predation), and therefore can play a critical role in the dynamics and structure of ecological communities. 
 
 
 
Key concepts 
 
 
 
Phenotypic plasticity in species traits is widespread and represented across diverse taxa and ecosystems. 
 
 
 
 
To reduce predation risk, organisms respond to predator (including herbivore) presence by modifying traits, including developmental, morphological, physiological, life historical and behavioural characteristics. 
 
 
 
 
Phenotypic responses to predators often incur a cost to prey fitness correlates such as growth rate and survival. These costs to fitness are termed nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) of the predator on its prey, to distinguish them from the consumptive effects (CEs) due to predation. 
 
 
 
 
Phenotypic responses by prey to predators alter the nature of the interactions between prey and other (third) species. The predator is said to have a trait-mediated indirect effect (TMIE) on the third species through induced changes in the intermediate species’ (prey's) traits. 
 
 
 
 
Predator-induced changes in prey traits can lead to TMIEs of the predator on prey resources (resulting in trait-mediated trophic cascades), prey competitors and other predators of the prey. 
 
 
 
 
NCEs and TMIEs can qualitatively change the nature of species interactions. For example, predator-induced changes in prey traits can reverse competitive interactions, and lead to increases in prey growth rates due to strong TMIEs on prey resources. 
 
 
 
 
NCEs and TMIEs can contribute strongly, and even dominate, the net effect of predators on prey and net indirect effect of the predator on species the prey interacts with. Thus, they can strongly affect prey population growth rates, community structure and ecosystem processes. 
 
 
 
 
Factors, such as temperature, resource growth rates, prey density and prey–competitor density, can strongly influence the magnitude of NCEs and TMIEs. 
 
 
 
 
It will be necessary to formally incorporate phenotypic responses of prey to predators into the conceptual foundations of ecology and strategies for the management of ecological systems.

https://doi.org/10.1093/BEHECO/ART069,Prey handling performance facilitates competitive dominance of an invasive over native keystone ant,"Studies of species coexistence in ant communities often suggest that competitive interactions are mediated by behavioral trade-offs between resource discovery and dominance. However, these studies have always measured foraging at artificial, static baits that omit traits of living prey items and potential coevolutionary predator–prey relationships. In a series of lab experiments, we compare the ability of ants to harvest live termites (Reticulitermes virginicus) in nests varying in defensive ability. Moreover, we compare foraging performance of 2 co-occurring ant species—the North American native Aphaenogaster rudis and the invasive Pachycondyla chinensis—differing in their evolutionary experience hunting R. virginicus. Our results show how the invasive P. chinensis may displace the native keystone A. rudis by directly killing A. rudis workers and reducing termite prey available for A. rudis. Specifically, P. chinensis is more sensitive to novel termite prey than the native A. rudis and then destroys termite colonies—even if they are highly defended by soldiers or nest architecture. Our results further show how whole colony behavioral dominance by P. chinensis is mediated by behavioral interactions among individual workers. More generally, our experimental approach using live prey to study interspecific competition can integrate evolutionary dynamics into studies of proximate behavioral factors governing species coexistence.",60a146cdb8d3edeefbb701ba8e68a42467b8664f,60a146cdb8d3edeefbb701ba8e68a42467b8664f,0,True,0.9562001824378967,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ECS2.2564,Mistletoe generates non‐trophic and trait‐mediated indirect interactions through a shared host of herbivore consumers,"Indirect interactions emerge among a wide range of herbivores sharing the same plant resource. Consumers usually belong to different trophic guilds, from folivores and sapsuckers to parasitic plants. We propose that mistletoes parasitizing pines could play a key role acting as herbivores on host pines and coming indirectly into competition with other herbivores feeding on the same host. Changes caused by mistletoes on its host have been well studied, but its effects running across trophic webs remain unrevealed. In this study, we investigate the effect of European mistletoe (Viscum album subsp. austriacum) on the host‐feeding herbivores via trait‐mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) across their shared pine host (Pinus nigra subsp. salzmannii). We performed field and laboratory experiments, and analyzed the net effect of different mistletoe parasite loads on three host‐phytophagous species: the sapsucker Cinara pini (Aphididae), the winter folivore Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Thaumetopoeidae), and the summer folivore Brachyderes sp. (Curculionidae), all being members of different functional feeding groups (FFGs). We summarize the mistletoe–host–herbivore interactions by means of a TMII, where mistletoe parasitism causes non‐trophic links and detrimental indirect interactions on pine‐feeding herbivores across its shared host, suggesting a worsening of host quality as food. These indirect interactions vary according to three parameters. First, the intensity has a non‐proportional relation with parasite load, showing an impact threshold on highly parasitized pines. Second, the movement capacity of insect herbivores determines their response, by decreasing the abundance of herbivores with low movement ability (aphids and pine processionary caterpillars) while altering the behavior (plant selection) of more mobile herbivores (pine weevils). Finally, FFG determines the intensity of mistletoe parasitism effects, folivores being more responsive than sapsuckers.

Successful males hatched earlier and therefore had a developmental ’head start’ over less successful males (i.e., males with eggs > male territory holders without eggs > floaters). Alternatively, males can apparently achieve success by growing faster: for males born in the same month, those with eggs grew faster than those with territories and no eggs, and both groups grew faster than floaters. These results suggest that accelerated growth rate may mediate the effects of a later hatch date, and that both hatch dates and growth rates influence the success of adult males, likely through proximate effects on individual phenotypes.  Identifying sources of variation in individual reproductive success is crucial to our understanding of population dynamics and evolutionary ecology. In many systems, the determinants of success are not well known. Where species have parental care, for example, determinants of success can be particularly challenging to partition between parents and offspring. Male parental care is common among fishes, where resources such as high quality territories and mates often may be limiting. In such systems, individual success of offspring may result from distinct life history pathways that are influenced by both parental effects (e.g., timing of reproduction) and by the offspring themselves (e.g., ’personalities’). These pathways, in turn, can induce phenotypic variation and affect success later in life. The drivers and consequences of variable life histories are not well understood in the context of reproductive success.  In this thesis I investigate drivers and consequences of variable life histories, for a small reef fish that exhibits male parental care (the common triplefin Forsterygion lapillum). I examined the influence of individual life history, phenotype and behaviour on (1) the performance of recently settled juveniles, and (2) the reproductive success adult males. I made field-based observations of adult males during the breeding season, measured their phenotypic traits (body size and condition) and used their otoliths to reconstruct life history characteristics (hatch dates and mean growth rates). Some males showed no evidence of territorial defence and were defined as ’floaters’; others defended territories, and a subset of these also had nests with eggs present. Adult male body size was significantly higher for males that defended breeding territories, and body condition was significantly higher for the males that had eggs (i.e., had successfully courted females). My otolith-based reconstructions of life history traits suggested two alternate pathways to ’success’ for adult males. Successful males hatched earlier and therefore had a developmental ’head start’ over less successful males (i.e., males with eggs > male territory holders without eggs > floaters). Alternatively, males can apparently achieve success by growing faster: for males born in the same month, those with eggs grew faster than those with territories and no eggs, and both groups grew faster than floaters. These results suggest that accelerated growth rate may mediate the effects of a later hatch date, and that both hatch dates and growth rates influence the success of adult males, likely through proximate effects on individual phenotypes.  I evaluated the effects of variable life history in a complimentary lab-based study. Specifically, I manipulated the developmental environments (feeding regime and temperature) for young fish and evaluated the direct effects on life history traits and phenotypes. Then, I conducted an assay to quantify the indirect effects of developmental environment, life history traits, and phenotypes on aggression and performance of young fish. These developmental environments did not have a clear, overall effect on juvenile phenotype or performance (i.e. behavioural aggression and the ability to dominate a resource). Instead, individuals (irrespective of developmental environment) that grew faster and/or longer pelagic larval durations had increased odds of dominating a limited resource. I attributed the non-significant direct effect of developmental environment to within-treatment mortality and variation among individuals in terms of their realised access to food (i.e., dominance hierarchies were apparent in rearing chambers, suggesting a non-uniform access to food). Fish that were more likely to dominate a resource were also more aggressive (i.e., more likely to engage in chasing behaviours). Fish that were larger and more aggressive established territories that were deemed to be of higher ’quality’ (inferred from percent cover of cobble resources). Overall, this study suggests a complex interplay between social systems, phenotype and life history. Developmental environments may influence phenotypes, although behavioural differences among individuals may moderate that effect, contributing to additional variation in phenotypes and life history traits which, in turn, shape the success of individuals.  Collectively, my thesis emphasises the consequences of life history variability on success at multiple life stages. These results may be relevant to other species that exhibit male parental care or undergo intense competition for space during early life stages.

There is a growing appreciation of the need to understand the effects of climate change on species interactions and how changes in interactions can influence the ability of species to persist in the face of climate change (Araújo and Luoto, 2007; Thuiller et al., 2008; Svenning et al., 2014). However, empirical or experimental studies investigating species interactions under climate change remain extremely scarce. Alexander et al. (2015) use experimental transplants of European alpine plant species and communities to provide valuable insight into some of the novel competitive interactions that may emerge as species migrate upslope to keep pace with rising temperatures. More specifically, they look at performance of plant species under simulated upslope migrations into preexisting higher-elevation plant communities as well as the performance of plant species that fail to migrate and find themselves competing with new suites of species migrating into their community from below. This is a useful approximation of some of the scenarios that are already being created by the unequal responses of species to climate and the creation of novel communities. One limitation of the study by Alexander et al. (2015) is the omission of the earliest phases of establishment when processes such as dispersal and germination are crucial in the encroachment of initial populations of migrant species into the new locations (Hampe, 2011). In particular, the experimental set up fails to account for one of the potentially most important drivers of community assembly—priority effects. Priority effects refer to the observation that early colonists will often inhibit, or alternatively facilitate, the establishment of subsequent colonizers (Connell and Slatyer, 1977). The concept of priority effect has been assimilated into community assembly theory to explain the fact that some communities may exist in alternative stable states depending on the timing and order of the arriving species and their traits, such as competitive ability or fecundity (Young et al., 2001). Priority effects can facilitate establishment of new species through changes in the environment or mutualisms. For example, in alpine communities, cushion plants can ameliorate environmental conditions and thereby increase the survival of other species leading to higher species richness (Cavieres et al., 2014). On the other hand, inhibitory priority effects can occur through legacies in the plant-soil feedbacks (Grman and Suding, 2010) or size-mediated priority effects and asymmetric competition (Weiner, 1990; Rasmussen et …",723f483e2eabd13a370f648f889ade65ec5f1e50,723f483e2eabd13a370f648f889ade65ec5f1e50,0,True,0.9304729700088501,0

1. Resource availability can influence the structure of animal communities by mediating competitive interactions. An underappreciated aspect of resource ecology is how functional traits are built from particular sets of nutrients and thus are underexpressed when those nutrients are scarce.

2. One idea linking resource availability to competition is the metabolic fuel hypothesis, which posits that access to carbohydrate-rich resources favours high activity rates that increase competitive prowess. One prediction of this hypothesis is that an increase in dietary carbohydrate richness will lead to an increase in consumer metabolic rate (MR). An alternative prediction is that carbohydrate-rich diets will affect biochemical storage.

3. We tested these predictions by examining the effect of dietary protein : carbohydrate (P : C) ratio on the feeding behaviour, demography, physiology and MR of colonies of Ectatomma ruidum, a common tropical ant. We found that rearing colonies for 6 weeks on different P : C diets altered colony demography and worker storage biochemistry, but higher carbohydrate intake did not result in an increase in whole-colony MR.

4. Our results suggest that dietary carbohydrates may increase colony dominance through changes in colony composition and individual worker longevity rather than changes in worker activity rates. More generally, they illustrate how the identity of scarce nutrients can have particular effects on traits that impact ecological interactions.",7e1878ef5524d9eca8b5aedbd0448780d08d5466,7e1878ef5524d9eca8b5aedbd0448780d08d5466,0,True,0.9935662150382996,0

We know now from theory and work in experimental and model systems that these processes can feed back on each other on mutually relevant time‐scales. Here, we present evidence of a soil‐mediated eco‐evolutionary feedback on the population dynamics of an invasive biennial plant, Alliaria petiolata. As populations age, natural selection drives down production of A. petiolata's important antimycorrhizal allelochemical, sinigrin. This occurs due to density‐dependent selection on sinigrin, which is favoured under interspecific, but disfavoured under intraspecific, competition. We show that population stochastic growth rates (λS) and plant densities are positively related to sinigrin concentration measured in seedling roots. This interaction is mediated by sinigrin's positive effect on seedling and summer survival, which are important drivers of λS. Together, these illustrate how the evolution of a trait shaped by natural selection can influence the ecology of a species over a period of just years to decades, altering its trajectory of population growth and interactions with the species in the soil and plant communities it invades. Our findings confirm the predictions that eco‐evolutionary feedbacks occur in natural populations. Furthermore, they improve our conceptual framework for projecting future population growth by linking the variation in plant demography to a critical competitive trait (sinigrin) whose selective advantages decrease as populations age.",7efe0009bcb665ffca2a364f3430092f6af0d834,7efe0009bcb665ffca2a364f3430092f6af0d834,0,True,0.9980641007423401,0

However, the extent to which functional traits reflect floristic turnover in response to interactions between climate and landscape gradients is rarely assessed. We tested whether floristic variation among sites within a bioregion was more strongly correlated with soil fertility or climate. We then examined the relationship between floristic composition, environment and the co-variation of selected vegetative and regenerative functional traits. This allowed us to assess the ecological sorting of species along soil fertility and rainfall gradients and to detect any resource compensation effects via interactions between these factors. Floristic differences were equally associated with soil fertility and climate contrasts but species' trait patterns were more strongly associated with soil fertility than rainfall. No interactive effects, which would suggest resource compensation, were detected. Instead, more fertile sites consistently had more forbs, annuals and grasses in comparison with less fertile sites which were dominated by woody species and had a higher abundance of graminoids. Three broad mechanisms for sorting of species based on trait patterns are proposed (1) differences in the fundamental regenerative and growth niche, (2) resource competition during establishment and (3) disturbance-mediated sorting.",80384dd5dda3fe66a3debb6d2b9f447c2df701b4,80384dd5dda3fe66a3debb6d2b9f447c2df701b4,0,True,0.9897713661193848,0

We assessed the seed dispersal success by tracking the fates of 21 600 tagged seeds from six paired sympatric tree species in both monospecific and mixed plots across 4 successive years in a subtropical forest. We found that apparent mutualism was associated with the interspecific synchrony of seed rain both seasonally and yearly, whereas apparent competition or apparent predation was associated with interspecific asynchrony of seed rain either seasonally or yearly.

Intraspecific variation in metabolic rates and, hence, resource demands covary with competitive ability. The effects of metabolism on conspecific interactions, however, have mostly been studied under laboratory conditions. We used a trait‐specific response‐surface design to test for the effects of metabolism on pairwise interactions of the marine colonial invertebrate, Bugula neritina in the field. Specifically, we compared the performance (survival, growth, and reproduction) of focal individuals, both in the presence and absence of a neighbor colony, both of which had their metabolic phenotype characterized. Survival of focal colonies depended on the metabolic phenotype of the neighboring individual, and on the combination of both the focal and neighbor colony metabolic phenotypes that were present. Surprisingly, we found pervasive effects of neighbor metabolic phenotypes on focal colony growth and reproduction, although the sign and strength of these effects showed strong microenvironmental variability. Overall, we find that the metabolic phenotype changes the strength of competitive interactions, but these effects are highly contingent on local conditions. We suggest future studies explore how variation in metabolic rate affects organisms beyond the focal organism alone, particularly under field conditions.",96b991f5f881b2df26549d9ab2b1486a42ab5083,96b991f5f881b2df26549d9ab2b1486a42ab5083,0,True,0.9267939925193787,0

Research across diverse taxa suggest they may play important roles in population divergence and speciation. They may involve various kinds of traits, including morphological and behavioral traits and those related to life history. Many of the evolutionary, ecological, and genetic mechanisms producing and maintaining resource polymorphisms are similar among phylogenetically distinct species. Although further studies are needed, the genetic basis may be simple, in some cases under the control of a single locus, with phenotypic plasticity playing a proximate role in some taxa. Divergent selection including either directional, disruptive, or frequency-dependent selection is important in their evolution.

Eurasian perch is one of many species of fish in lakes of postglacial origin that displays a morphological and dietary variation tightly coupled to the littoral and pelagic habitats of the lake. The occurrence of such resource polymorphisms might have important consequences for local adaptation and might also be an important initial step in speciation. I have investigated the importance of a number of factors for the development of resource polymorphisms using perch as a study organism. I found a weak genetic basis for morphological differences, and the environmental influence on morphology was of such a magnitude that an induced morphology could be reversed. The results nevertheless suggested that genetic differentiation could be substantial at small spatial and temporal scales, even within habitats. Several environmental factors were shown to influence the morphological development, and the results also suggest that behavioral differences could mediate a morphological response. I also found evidence for that competition-driven divergence might only occur when divergence in resource use is favoured at the same time as growth rates are kept sufficiently high for character divergence to be effective. The results finally indicate that divergence in the gut length of individuals might co-vary with habitat and diet use in resource polymorphic populations. This might enhance habitat fidelity and possibly also facilitate the persistence of resource polymorphisms since individuals should experience a cost of switching diets due to a too specific digestive system. Based on these findings I conclude that small scaled genetic differentiation might be more common than currently acknowledged, that more multi-factorial studies are needed if we are to fully understand the mechanisms behind trait diversity, and that competition not always favors divergence.",a6b703a8b8faa9d85782c469f5d2948a21650f51,a6b703a8b8faa9d85782c469f5d2948a21650f51,0,True,0.9591233730316162,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/OIK.03157,Associational resistance or susceptibility: the indirect interaction between chemically‐defended and non‐defended herbivore prey via a shared predator,"Many organisms possess chemical defences against their natural enemies, which render them unpalatable or toxic when attacked or consumed. These chemically-defended organisms commonly occur in communities with non- or less-defended prey, leading to indirect interactions between prey species, mediated by natural enemies. Although the importance of enemy-mediated indirect interactions have been well documented (e.g., apparent competition), how the presence of prey chemical defences may affect predation of non-defended prey in terrestrial communities remains unclear. Here, an experimental approach was used to study the predator-mediated indirect interaction between a chemically-defended and non-defended pest aphid species. Using laboratory-based mesocosms, aphid community composition was manipulated to include chemically-defended (CD) aphids (Brevicoryne brassicae), non-defended (ND) aphids (Myzus persicae) or a mixed assemblage of both species, on Brassica oleracea cabbage plants, in the presence or absence of a shared predator (Chrysoperla carnea larvae). Aphid population growth rates, aphid distributions on host plants and predator growth rates were measured. In single-species treatments, C. carnea reduced M. persicae population growth rate, but had no significant impact on B. brassicae population growth rate, suggesting B. brassicae chemical defences are effective against C. carnea. C. carnea had no significant impact on either aphid species population growth rate in mixed-species treatments. M. persicae (ND) therefore experienced reduced predation in the presence of B. brassicae (CD) through a predator-mediated indirect effect. Moreover, predator growth rates were significantly higher in the M. persicae-only treatments than in either the B. brassicae-only or mixed-species treatments, suggesting predation was impaired in the presence of B. brassicae (CD). A trait-mediated indirect interaction is proposed, consistent with associational resistance, in which the predator, upon incidental consumption of chemically-defended aphids is deterred from feeding, releasing non-defended aphids from predatory control.",abf65e95003853c048d12910944671c3cfddb93f,abf65e95003853c048d12910944671c3cfddb93f,0,True,0.9366354942321777,0

Poplar species (Populus spp.) are frequently used for such plantations as they maintain high yield along wide environmental ranges. Specifically aspen (Populus tremula and P. tremuloides) reach considerable productivity even on poor soils and exhibit relatively high drought tolerance when compared to other taxa of the genus. However, the use of aspen in SRF systems is not well established. The aim of this study was to investigate the intra- and interspecific variation of above- and belowground functional traits which determine differences in environmental adaptation, drought tolerance, competitive strength and hence overall species performance in different aspen demes and two further poplar species (P. tremula and P. trichocarpa). This information may contribute to optimize yield and reducing the risk of failure in plantings under current and future climates. Major differences in functional above- and belowground traits of aspen demes of particular environmental adaptation became evident in the course of this study (Chapter 2). However, variance within the aspen fine root system properties is considerably high and above- and belowground trait correspondence remains inconsistent. Fine root properties are to a lesser extent related to genetic distance among demes than leaf-related properties. The high degree of plasticity in belowground (fine root) traits compared to aboveground traits implies a heterogeneous response to high spatial and temporal variability of belowground resources what may be of relevance for species growth performance. This may also explain why the variation in fine root morphological traits was not directly linked to differences in growth among the demes. Instead, much of the within-deme variation of the investigated root morphological traits may be explained by differentiating single root sections according to the hierarchical branching structure (root orders).The intraspecific variation in wood anatomical and hydraulic properties of branches and coarse roots in five genetically distinct demes were related to variation in aboveground productivity and drought resistance (Chapter 3). Genotypic differences in the dependence of growth on branch xylem hydraulic efficiency and on hydraulic safety (cavitation vulnerability) were found. By contrast, a large variation in coarse root anatomical and hydraulic traits did not determine growth performance or drought resistance among the demes but manifest in the observation of ‘high-conductivity roots’ with extraordinarily large vessels which state the functional heterogeneity within the poplar root system. Belowground competition effects on physiologically important fine root morphological and chemical properties of P. tremula and P. trichocarpa saplings along roots of different order and age were identified (Chapter 4). First, the strong control exerted by the root order position or the age of a root segment on different root traits became evident and enabled species differentiation according to the investigated traits. The minor influence of different competition treatments on fine root morphology and chemistry suggests that morphological adaptation in response to competition is not a mandatory phenomenon. Moreover, the comparison of harvest data (fine roots of the box interior) and direct root growth observations (at a transparent front plate) revealed a mismatch between the two types of data suggesting that root polymorphism may strongly impact the interpretation of rhizoscope data. This study is the first to describe the inherent complexity and heterogeneity of the poplar root system in its anatomy, morphology and function on an intraspecific as well as interspecific scale. Further experiments and detailed root analysis within long-term field studies are needed for a better understanding of belowground root-related processes in poplar species.",b3cd711af6192ba3397ac9cdc33e2217145eb7a8,b3cd711af6192ba3397ac9cdc33e2217145eb7a8,0,True,0.9189867377281189,0

In the study reported here, host-mediated interactions were explored for two aphid species that feed on plants of the genus Cheno- podium. Pemphigus betae feeds underground on roots, while Hayhurstia atriplicis feeds aboveground where it forms leaf galls. Although they never encountered one another directly, these two aphid species shared a common resource, the phloem sap of their host. We examined the effects of each of these herbivore species on their host plants and on one another through several garden and growth chamber experiments. Four major results emerged. First, the root-feeding aphid P. betae had no significant effects on its hosts. In contrast, leaf galling by H. atriplicis reduced overall host mass by an average of 54% and seed set by an average of 60%. Second, competitive interactions between the herbivore species depended on the level of host resistance to leaf galling by H. atriplicis. On susceptible plants, leaf-galling colonies of H. atriplicis reduced P. betae numbers by an average of 9 1%, often eliminating the root feeders entirely. In contrast, on plants resistant to galling, H. atriplic is were smaller and did not affect P. betae infesting roots of the same hosts. Third, the interaction was asymmetrical; although H. atriplicis had a strong negative effect on P. betae, the latter showed no measurable effects on H. atriplicis. Censuses indicated that the strong negative effects of H. atriplicis on P. betae, as found in the growth chamber and garden experiments, also take place naturally in the field. Fourth, although one might expect plants resistant to one aphid species to be resistant to other aphids also, resistance to leaf-galling aphids is not correlated with resistance to root-feeding aphids in this system.",b77cf52fc81dc4f32ce9f56e05953ce7244aecdb,b77cf52fc81dc4f32ce9f56e05953ce7244aecdb,0,True,0.9080215096473694,0

 European honey bees have been introduced across the globe and may compete with native bees for floral resources. Compounding effects of urbanization and introduced species on native bees are, however, unclear. Here, we investigated how honey bee abundance and foraging patterns related to those of native bee abundance and diversity in residential gardens and native vegetation remnants for 2 years in urbanized areas of the Southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot and assessed how niche overlap influenced these relationships. Honey bees did not overtly suppress native bee abundance; however, complex relationships emerged when analysing these relationships according to body size, time of day and floral resource levels. Native bee richness was positively correlated with overall honeybee abundance in the first year, but negatively correlated in the second year, and varied with body size. Native bees that had higher resource overlap with honey bees were negatively associated with honey bee abundance, and resource overlap between honey bees and native bees was higher in residential gardens. Relationships with honey bees varied between native bee taxa, reflecting adaptations to different flora, plus specialization. Thus, competition with introduced bees varies by species and location, mediated by dietary breadth and overlap and by other life-history traits of individual bee species.",b9fbe6b9bb823369f41fd85fcbbd833bc3d28513,b9fbe6b9bb823369f41fd85fcbbd833bc3d28513,0,True,0.9916819930076599,0

Here, we study the relative importance of grazers, water physics and chemistry on the daily net accumulation rates (AR) of individual phytoplankton from natural communities, grouped into six size classes from circa 10 to 500 μm. Using a Random Forest modelling approach and four years of daily data from a lake, we find that water temperature is generally a pivotal control of all phytoplankton AR. At the same time, nutrients and light are important for the smallest and the largest classes. Mesozooplankton abundance is a key predictor of the AR for small phytoplankton, with microzooplankton being important for the middle-size range. In our data, large and small phytoplankton have different (seasonal) blooming patterns: small forms are favoured by low temperature and grazing, and high phosphorus levels. Larger forms show positive ARs at high temperatures and low phosphorus (being relatively insensitive to zooplankton grazing). These results help us understand the opportunities and limitations of using size to explain and model phytoplankton responses to biotic and abiotic environmental change.",bae526269ee8e22aa32613680071625ede43f651,bae526269ee8e22aa32613680071625ede43f651,0,True,0.9796051383018494,0
https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aat2456,Bacterial antagonism in host-associated microbial communities,"Interspecies competition shapes communities The gut microbiota of mammals is diverse and dynamic, and gut bacteria respond sensitively to diet and drug intake. Nevertheless, in a healthy adult, microbial community composition remains remarkably stable over time, despite being highly individual. García-Bayona and Comstock review the mechanisms that gut bacterial species use to jostle for space and resources and maintain their populations in the face of intense and varied competition. Bacteria have evolved a range of antibiotics, bacteriocins, toxins, and delivery devices to enable interspecies conflict. These interbacterial weapons possess a spectrum of specificities and range from those that target strains of their own species to broad-acting bacteriocides. This toxic armamentarium provides a valuable resource for potential therapeutic development. Science, this issue p. eaat2456 BACKGROUND Microbial communities are ubiquitous on Earth. The microbiota of different habitats are diverse and have distinct functional traits, but there are common ecological principles that govern their composition. The ability of a microbe to compete with other members of its community for resources is paramount to its success. Competition through the production of molecules that harm other members, known as interference competition, is also important in the assembly and maintenance of microbial communities. As new technologies allow for more in-depth analyses of microbial communities and their genetic content, we are better able to identify new antimicrobial toxins and analyze the effects of their production. Here, we explore the range of antibacterial protein/peptide toxins and toxin-secretion systems, together with the fitness benefits they confer to the producing organisms. Because human-associated microbial communities have been intensely studied over the past decade, our focus is on the growing body of data regarding bacterial antagonism in these and other host-associated microbial communities. ADVANCES Studies continue to reveal the large arsenal of antibacterial peptides and proteins that bacteria produce and the secretion systems that they use to deliver these toxins to competing cells. Bacterially produced antimicrobial peptides and proteins are diverse in terms of their structures, cellular targets, mechanisms of action, and spatial range. Their antagonistic range also varies; some are limited to intraspecies killing, whereas others are able to kill across genera, families, and orders. Through a combination of mathematical modeling and experimental model systems, the ecological outcomes of bacterial antagonism are being elucidated. In vivo analyses in host models have shown that some antimicrobial toxins play a role in microbiota-mediated colonization resistance by preventing invasion of pathogens. Some pathogens, however, also use toxins to battle with the resident microbiota to invade an ecosystem and cause disease. Antagonism has also been shown to facilitate genome evolution; the DNA released from killed cells can be taken up and incorporated into the aggressor’s genome. In some cases, antagonism has been shown to increase rather than reduce microbial diversity, potentially through promotion of spatial segregation of competing strains, facilitating the exchange of signals and secreted products between related cells (kin). The factors that regulate the production and release of some antibacterial toxins are also becoming better understood. Studies are revealing that toxin producers respond to various environmental signals, including signals that indicate host occupancy, that nutrients are limiting, or that they may be attacked by other bacterial community members. OUTLOOK Although bacterial antagonism is an active area of research, we are still in the early stages of understanding the impacts of these interactions in natural community settings and how they influence the overall structure, dynamics, and composition of complex microbial communities. The rapid increase in the number of available metagenomic datasets derived from diverse microbial communities and the expanding capability to culture and genetically modify these organisms is allowing for the identification and characterization of new . The protective function of microbiota-produced toxins in warding off pathogens indicates a potential for applications in medical, agricultural, and other industrial settings. In addition, the inclusion of antibacterial toxins in genetically engineered bacteria (live biotherapeutics) may allow for specific targeting of harmful community members, including those involved in therapeutic failures, and may also allow a live biotherapeutic to compete with members of the microbiota to deliver various health-promoting functions. Intra- and interspecies antagonism—the example of Bacteroides species in the human gut. Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides uniformis use MACPF (membrane attack complex/perforin) toxins—BSAP-1 and BSAP-2, respectively—for intraspecies killing. Producer strains carry a modified receptor [outer membrane protein (OMP) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) glycan] that confers resistance to its cognate toxin. B. fragilis can also kill other B. fragilis strains and most gut Bacteroidales species via type VI secretion systems (T6SSs). Antagonistic interactions are abundant in microbial communities and contribute not only to the composition and relative proportions of their members but also to the longer-term stability of a community. This Review will largely focus on bacterial antagonism mediated by ribosomally synthesized peptides and proteins produced by members of host-associated microbial communities. We discuss recent findings on their diversity, functions, and ecological impacts. These systems play key roles in ecosystem defense, pathogen invasion, spatial segregation, and diversity but also confer indirect gains to the aggressor from products released by killed cells. Investigations into antagonistic bacterial interactions are important for our understanding of how the microbiota establish within hosts, influence health and disease, and offer insights into potential translational applications.",c64661161b43f837cfa9d61c10c9e8cbfcd5495a,c64661161b43f837cfa9d61c10c9e8cbfcd5495a,0,True,0.9786490797996521,0
https://doi.org/10.26686/wgtn.17008093.v1,"Factors influencing the recruitment, growth and reproduction of a temperate reef fish, Forsterygion lapillum","In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of population dynamics, it is vital to identify the key factors that contribute to variation in both survival and reproductive success throughout the life history of an organism. The population dynamics of reef fishes may be influenced by events occurring across multiple life stages, throughout the entire life cycle. For instance, the input of new individuals into a population (recruitment) is heavily shaped by mortality in the larval and juvenile stages, which is influenced by conspecific interactions and habitat characteristics. For individuals that survive, variation in somatic growth histories during development may influence mating success among fish that successfully recruit into the adult population, and particular developmental histories may receive a disproportionate amount of a population’s reproductive output. However, female preferences for particular phenotypes may also be modified by events occurring in adult life, such as parasite infection. Finally, absolute reproductive success (i.e., the number of offspring that survive to reproductive age) may be dependent upon early larval mortality of offspring, and variation in larval mortality among spawning sites could have consequences for metapopulation dynamics. In this thesis, I investigated how recruitment, growth and reproductive success varied among individuals of a small temperate reef fish, Forsterygion lapillum, the common triplefin, based upon their developmental histories, morphological traits, and habitat characteristics (including conspecific densities, regional locations, etc.). Specifically, I examined:  - how the spatial distribution and survival of juveniles is influenced by age-class interactions (Chapter 2) - verified methods to measure somatic growth rates during development using scale structures (Chapter 3) - explored how previous growth rates influence reproductive success (Chapter 4) - evaluated how reproductive success is modified by the presence of ectoparasites (Chapter 5) - and finally, assessed how natal origin modifies larval survival probabilities among offspring (Chapter 6).  The larvae of many reef fishes settle into habitats that are already occupied by adults, and interactions between age classes (intercohort interactions) may affect spatial variation in recruitment strength across settlement sites. In Chapter 2, I evaluated spatial covariation in juvenile and adult densities of F. lapillum (within the preferred settlement habitats of juveniles) to investigate correlations between adult and juvenile densities potentially caused by age-class interactions. The relationship between juvenile and adult densities followed a dome-shaped curve, with a negative correlation between juveniles and adults at higher adult densities. The shape of this curve was temporally variable, but was otherwise unaffected by particular features of the site (algal species identity). Using a laboratory-based experiment that used a “multiple predator effects” (MPE) design, I tested the hypothesis that increased settler mortality, caused by either (i) intercohort competition leading to enhanced predation risk or (ii) cannibalism by adults on juveniles, contributed to the observed negative relationship between juvenile and adult densities. Results suggested overall mortality attributable to cannibalism was low; however, smaller settlers appeared to be more vulnerable to cannibalism. There was no evidence that combined or interacting effects between predators (F. lapillum adults and Forsterygion varium [the variable triplefin]) increased predation risk in settlers of F. lapillum. Overall, these results highlight the potentially complex effects adult residents may have on shaping patterns of recruitment and the distributions of new juveniles.  Somatic growth rates through ontogeny are one of the most important metrics for understanding fish populations and in Chapter 3, I evaluate the use of spacing between growth increments on fish scales (called circuli) as a measurement technique for assessing historical growth in F. lapillum. First, I established the relationship between scale growth and body size, and determined how variable this relationship was among populations. The body-scale size relationship was strongly positive and was unaffected by gender; however, there did appear to be significant differences between certain populations. Second, I monitored somatic and fish scale growth in the laboratory to measure the relationship between somatic growth and spacing between growth increments (intercirculus spacing). New scale growth and circuli deposition were both positively correlated with somatic growth. Average intercirculus spacing was also positively correlated with somatic growth rate, but this appeared to differ between age/size classes, with the older and larger individuals showing a weaker relationship. Results suggest that intercirculus spacing can be used to determine previous growth histories, but may be limited to particular size/age ranges (e.g., juveniles).  In Chapter 4, I employ the techniques developed in Chapter 3 to examine how early growth rates (derived from fish scales) and male morphological traits explain variation in reproductive output between individual males in F. lapillum. I measured the reproductive success of breeding males in relation to their size and growth rates over the breeding season at two different spawning locations. Clutch size (number of eggs per nest) was highly variable among individuals over the study period; however, I detected a significant, albeit subtle, negative correlation between clutch size and growth rates after settlement. Although growth explained relatively small amounts of total variation, it was the only male trait I measured that significantly correlated with clutch size. The negative effects of faster growth on clutch size were greatest during the period of growth after settlement suggesting that growth at this early stage may be important for later reproductive success (early post-settlement).  In Chapter 5, I examined how infection with an ectoparasite modified reproductive success among individual males using a field survey. Females often preferentially mate with unparasitised males, and therefore parasitised males experience lowered reproductive success. In this study, individuals of greater total length were more likely to be infected with an ectoparasite, but were also more likely to have an egg nest. Parasite infection had no effect on reproductive success (either the presence of a nest, or the average surface area of eggs if a nest was present). Positive covariation in total length, reproductive success, and parasite infection potentially suggest that the influence of parasitic infection on reproductive success may depend upon the strength of selection for larger male body size. In addition, this study provides the first quantitative measurement of ectoparasite infection for both the focal parasite species (Caligus buechlerae) and the host (F. lapillum).  Finally, in Chapter 6, I explore how larval survival is mediated by spawning location. In marine reef fish, spatially isolated adult populations may be connected (i.e., have gene flow) via larval dispersal; however, differential larval survival between source populations may mediate both the degree of population connectivity as well as the reproductive success of individuals within those source populations. To evaluate variation in larval quality among different spawning locations, I conducted a laboratory assay to measure the potential effects of source population on larval time to starvation, as starvation is often proposed as a major source of mortality for larval fish. Average survival time was 3.75 days, but survival analysis indicated that starvation resistance did not differ between the two natal sources. For individual nests, mean larval size was negatively correlated with their mean survival time, although this was only apparent in larvae collected from one population (the south coast). My findings indicate that variation in larval traits between source populations does exist, but that on average, source populations had equal resistance to starvation. Given the differences between source populations in (i) the relationship between larval mortality and larval size (i.e., the absence of size effects in one source population) and (ii) overall variation in larval size (larger larvae on the south coast), the relative contribution of larvae from each source population may vary under certain conditions (e.g., low levels of food availability).  In conclusion, the field surveys and laboratory experiments conducted in this thesis demonstrate the potential for a variety of factors across multiple life history stages to influence recruitment, growth and reproduction. These findings suggest that factors across multiple life stages (e.g., conspecific density, previous growth histories, or spawning site) have the ability to influence individual success, and in turn populations. By carefully considering and integrating these factors into our studies of population dynamics, we may be able to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the spatio-temporal fluctuations in populations for marine reef fish.",ca4bbe66f82ace7a40e9463ba9df157cbd865fb3,ca4bbe66f82ace7a40e9463ba9df157cbd865fb3,0,True,0.9558281898498535,0

Theory predicts that abiotic conditions and the competitive make‐up of resident communities jointly shape invader fitness, limiting the phenotypic identity of successful invaders. We use an invasion experiment to ask how competitive traits of 20 introduced plant species alter their absolute fitness in fragments that differ in size, abiotic conditions, and traits of the resident community. We show that abiotic conditions interact with both invader traits and resident functional diversity to determine invader survival. Optimal invader traits depended on the soil characteristics, while greater resident trait diversity lowered invader fitness and had especially strong effects in low‐resource environments. Unlike other abiotic conditions, fragment size had consistent effects irrespective of invader identity, decreasing survival in larger fragments. Synthesis. Our results illustrate how the abiotic environment mediates the effects of resident and invader traits on establishment, creating fitness landscapes that structure local diversity and the functional identities of successful species.",d6be4b430f00d79fef9af4271fe5e1d36e3b3352,d6be4b430f00d79fef9af4271fe5e1d36e3b3352,0,True,0.983653724193573,0
https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.932806,The key to complexity in interacting systems with multiple strains,"Ecological community structure, persistence and stability are shaped by multiple forces, acting on multiple scales. These include patterns of resource use and limitation, spatial heterogeneities, drift and migration. Pathogen strains co-circulating in a host population are a special type of an ecological community. They compete for colonization of susceptible hosts, and sometimes interact via altered susceptibilities to co-colonization. Diversity in such pairwise interaction traits enables the multiple strains to create dynamically their niches for growth and persistence, and ‘engineer’ their common environment. How such a network of interactions with others mediates collective coexistence remains puzzling analytically and computationally difficult to simulate. Furthermore, the gradients modulating stability-complexity regimes in such multi-player systems remain poorly understood. In a recent study, we presented an analytic framework for N-type coexistence in an SIS epidemiological system with co-colonization interactions. The multi-strain complexity was reduced from O(N2) dimensions of population structure to only N equations for strain frequency evolution on a long timescale. Here, we examine the key drivers of coexistence regimes in such a system. We find the ratio of single to co-colonization μ critically determines the type of equilibrium for multi-strain dynamics. This key quantity in the model encodes a trade-off between overall transmission intensity R0 and mean interaction coefficient in strain space k. Preserving a given coexistence regime, under fixed trait variation, can only be achieved from a balance between higher competition in favourable environments, and higher cooperation in harsher environments, consistent with the stress gradient hypothesis in ecology. Multi-strain coexistence regimes are more stable when μ is small, whereas as μ increases, dynamics tends to increase in complexity. There is an intermediate ratio that maximizes the existence and stability of a unique coexistence equilibrium between strains. This framework provides a foundation for linking invariant principles in collective coexistence across biological systems, and for understanding critical shifts in community dynamics, driven by simple and random pairwise interactions but potentiated by mean-field and environmental gradients.",dec058351d6092fb60d2abbfc7de8b6c9869e7b7,dec058351d6092fb60d2abbfc7de8b6c9869e7b7,0,True,0.9824402332305908,0

Ecological processes, in particular negative indirect effects mediated by shared natural enemies (apparent competition), may be important in structuring phytophagous insect communities. The potential for indirect interactions can be assessed by analyzing the trophic structure of insect communities, and we claim that quantitative food webs are particularly well suited for this task. We review the experimental evidence for both short-term and long-term apparent competition in phytophagous insect communities and discuss the possible interactions between apparent competition and intraguild predation or shared mutualists.

To date, this work has primarily focused on the effects of predator-induced behavioral plasticity on communities. However, predator-induced morphological plasticity, which has been documented in many taxa, might also lead to trait-mediated indirect effects. Here, I examined how predators altered the behavior and morphology of larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and leopard frogs (R. pipiens) and how these phenotypic changes altered the outcome of competition between the two species. 
 
Competition in the absence of caged predators was asymmetric; when reared separately, leopard frogs grew more than wood frogs, but when competing (without predators), wood frogs grew faster than leopard frogs. The presence of caged predators reversed the outcome of competition between the two anuran prey. In the presence of larval dragonflies (Anax spp.) or caged mudminnows (Umbra limi), leopard frogs grew faster than wood frogs while total tadpole biomass production remained unchanged. Thus, there was a predator-mediated indirect effect. 
 
Because predators alter both the behavior and morphology of larval anurans and both of these traits are known to affect resource consumption and growth, both are potential mechanisms to explain the change in competitive outcome. Changes in behavior were not related to changes in growth, but changes in morphology (specifically mouth width and tail length) were related to changes in growth. When competitors were added (without predators), wood frogs increased their mouth width by 10% and their tail length by 3%, while leopard frogs increased their mouth width by 5% and did not change their tail length. The greater increase in mouth width for wood frogs should increase their forage intake, since tadpoles feed by scraping periphyton; the importance of a 3% longer tail in competitive ability is unknown. The presence of the predator threat (via chemical cues from the caged predators) reduced both the mouth width and tail length in the two prey species to pre-competition levels. This response corresponded with the reduced competitive ability of the wood frogs. This work demonstrates that both competitors and predators can alter prey morphology and suggests that changes in morphology can cause trait-mediated indirect effects.",e4d8a15a418be329b5684ad74502f3627fd762dd,e4d8a15a418be329b5684ad74502f3627fd762dd,0,True,0.9559470415115356,0
https://doi.org/10.25932/PUBLISHUP-47941,Using individual-based modeling to understand grassland diversity and resilience in the Anthropocene,"The world’s grassland systems are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic change. Susceptible to a variety of different stressors, from land-use intensification to climate change, understanding the mechanisms driving the maintenance of these systems’ biodiversity and stability, and how these mechanisms may shift under human-mediated disturbance, is thus critical for successfully navigating the next century. Within this dissertation, I use an individual-based and spatially-explicit model of grassland community assembly (IBC-grass) to examine several processes, thought key to understanding their biodiversity and stability and how it changes under stress. In the first chapter of my thesis, I examine the conditions under which intraspecific trait variation influences the diversity of simulated grassland communities. In the second and third chapters of my thesis, I shift focus towards understanding how belowground herbivores influence the stability of these grassland systems to either a disturbance that results in increased, stochastic, plant mortality, or eutrophication. 
Intraspecific trait variation (ITV), or variation in trait values between individuals of the same species, is fundamental to the structure of ecological communities. However, because it has historically been difficult to incorporate into theoretical and statistical models, it has remained largely overlooked in community-level analyses. This reality is quickly shifting, however, as a consensus of research suggests that it may compose a sizeable proportion of the total variation within an ecological community and that it may play a critical role in determining if species coexist. Despite this increasing awareness that ITV matters, there is little consensus of the magnitude and direction of its influence. Therefore, to better understand how ITV changes the assembly of grassland communities, in the first chapter of my thesis, I incorporate it into an established, individual-based grassland community model, simulating both pairwise invasion experiments as well as the assembly of communities with varying initial diversities. By varying the amount of ITV in these species’ functional traits, I examine the magnitude and direction of ITV’s influence on pairwise invasibility and community coexistence. During pairwise invasion, ITV enables the weakest species to more frequently invade the competitively superior species, however, this influence does not generally scale to the community level. Indeed, unless the community has low alpha- and beta- diversity, there will be little effect of ITV in bolstering diversity. In these situations, since the trait axis is sparsely filled, the competitively inferior may suffer less competition and therefore ITV may buffer the persistence and abundance of these species for some time. 
In the second and third chapters of my thesis, I model how one of the most ubiquitous trophic interactions within grasslands, herbivory belowground, influences their diversity and stability. Until recently, the fundamental difficulty in studying a process within the soil has left belowground herbivory “out of sight, out of mind.” This dilemma presents an opportunity for simulation models to explore how this understudied process may alter community dynamics. In the second chapter of my thesis, I implement belowground herbivory – represented by the weekly removal of plant biomass – into IBC-grass. Then, by introducing a pulse disturbance, modelled as the stochastic mortality of some percentage of the plant community, I observe how the presence of belowground herbivores influences the resistance and recovery of Shannon diversity in these communities. I find that high resource, low diversity, communities are significantly more destabilized by the presence of belowground herbivores after disturbance. Depending on the timing of the disturbance and whether the grassland’s seed bank persists for more than one season, the impact of the disturbance – and subsequently the influence of the herbivores – can be greatly reduced. However, because human-mediated eutrophication increases the amount of resources in the soil, thus pressuring grassland systems, our results suggest that the influence of these herbivores may become more important over time. 
In the third chapter of my thesis, I delve further into understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of belowground herbivores on the diversity of grasslands by replicating an empirical mesocosm experiment that crosses the presence of herbivores above- and below-ground with eutrophication. I show that while aboveground herbivory, as predicted by theory and frequently observed in experiments, mitigates the impact of eutrophication on species diversity, belowground herbivores counterintuitively reduce biodiversity. Indeed, this influence positively interacts with the eutrophication process, amplifying its negative impact on diversity. I discovered the mechanism underlying this surprising pattern to be that, as the herbivores consume roots, they increase the proportion of root resources to root biomass. Because root competition is often symmetric, herbivory fails to mitigate any asymmetries in the plants’ competitive dynamics. However, since the remaining roots have more abundant access to resources, the plants’ competition shifts aboveground, towards asymmetric competition for light. This leads the community towards a low-diversity state, composed of mostly high-performance, large plant species. We further argue that this pattern will emerge unless the plants’ root competition is asymmetric, in which case, like its counterpart aboveground, belowground herbivory may buffer diversity by reducing this asymmetry between the competitively superior and inferior plants. 
I conclude my dissertation by discussing the implications of my research on the state of the art in intraspecific trait variation and belowground herbivory, with emphasis on the necessity of more diverse theory development in the study of these fundamental interactions. My results suggest that the influence of these processes on the biodiversity and stability of grassland systems is underappreciated and multidimensional, and must be thoroughly explored if researchers wish to predict how the world’s grasslands will respond to anthropogenic change. Further, should researchers myopically focus on understanding central ecological interactions through only mathematically tractable analyses, they may miss entire suites of potential coexistence mechanisms that can increase the coviability of species, potentially leading to coexistence over ecologically-significant timespans. Individual-based modelling, therefore, with its focus on individual interactions, will prove a critical tool in the coming decades for understanding how local interactions scale to larger contexts, and how these interactions shape ecological communities and further predicting how these systems will change under human-mediated stress.",ea3ad0d7899f608ee0ea0442a051ef59bad056c2,ea3ad0d7899f608ee0ea0442a051ef59bad056c2,0,True,0.961570143699646,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13028,Host traits and competitive ability jointly structure disease dynamics and community assembly.,"Parasitism and competition are both ubiquitous interactions in ecological communities. The ability of host species to interact directly via competition and indirectly through shared parasites suggests that host traits related to competition and parasitism are likely important in structuring communities and disease dynamics. Specifically, those host traits affecting competition and those mediating parasitism are often correlated either because of trade-offs (in resource acquisition or resource allocation) or condition dependence, yet the consequences of these trait relationships for community and epidemiological dynamics are poorly understood. We conducted a literature review of parasite-related host traits-competitive ability relationships. We found that transmission-competitive ability relationships were most often reported, and that superior competitors exhibited elevated transmission relative to their less-competitive counterparts in nearly 80% of the cases. We also found a significant number of virulence-competitive ability and parasite shedding-competitive ability relationships. We investigated these links by altering the relationship between host competitive ability and three parasite-related traits (transmission, virulence and parasite shedding rates) in a simple model, incorporating competitive asymmetries in a multi-host community. We show that these relationships can lead to a range of different communities. For example, depending on the strength and direction of these distinct trait relationships, we observed communities with anywhere from high parasite prevalence to complete parasite extinction, and either one, two or the maximum of three host species coexisting. Our results suggest that parasite-competitive ability relationships may be common in nature, that further integration of these relationships can produce novel and unexpected community and disease dynamics, and that generalizations may allow for the prediction of how parasitism and competition jointly structure disease and diversity in natural communities.",f0df51d9c947b2b8f3e6a5884bcf8c83ab27ce61,f0df51d9c947b2b8f3e6a5884bcf8c83ab27ce61,0,True,0.9264677166938782,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ECS2.1218,Herbivore density mediates the indirect effect of herbivores on plants via induced resistance and apparent competition,"Herbivore-induced plant resistance and apparent competition are two indirect ways herbivores interact. If a less damaging herbivore indirectly suppresses the abundance of a more damaging herbivore via these mechanisms, then plants may ultimately benefit. Changes in herbivore density, however, can dictate the intensity of species interactions and may play a critical role in determining the outcome of plant- and predator-mediated herbivore interactions. We tested the effects of herbivore density on the strength of indirect interactions among phloem-feeding aphids and herbivorous caterpillars and the outcome of these interactions for their shared host plant, cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). We quantified the survival of caterpillars on host plants that were infested with varying densities of aphids in the presence and absence of predators (ladybeetles). We found that aphids induced defensive proteins in cotton plants and that caterpillar survival was negatively affected by induced resistance. Likewise, we found that the presence of aphids increased predation of caterpillars by ladybeetles, but that apparent competition between aphids and caterpillars was density dependent. Ladybeetles consumed relatively high numbers of small caterpillars at low to intermediate aphid densities, but essentially became aphid specialists at high aphid densities. Aphid induced defenses and apparent competition combined such that plant damage by caterpillars was lowest when predators were present at low aphid density (induced resistance + highest level of apparent competition). This suggests that herbivores can benefit plants, but the effect on host plants is mediated by herbivore density. Indirect herbivore-plant mutualisms may increase plant quality, plant fitness, and yield of crop plants and these interactions need to be considered in ecologically based pest management plans. In addition, these interactions likely alter arthropod community structure and natural selection on anti-herbivore defense traits in plants in natural systems.",fc5312776738c6a1c139b9e0a5aedcdb7cd8f412,fc5312776738c6a1c139b9e0a5aedcdb7cd8f412,0,True,0.9667961001396179,0
