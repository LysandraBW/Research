TITLE: Diet quality and conspecific larval density predict functional trait variation and performance in a polyphagous frugivorous fly
ABSTRACT: Abstract Diet quality and the presence and abundance of conspecifics feeding on the same food resource are critical factors that affect functional traits of many animal species and influence ecological processes. We hypothesized that in insects whose larvae live in groups of varying sizes in ephemeral and nutritionally variable environments, extreme macronutrient content in the feeding substrate is a barrier for optimal performance that can be overcome by the collective feeding behaviour of large numbers of larvae. We experimentally examined how multiple immature and adult traits of the polyphagous tephritid fruit fly, Anastrepha ludens, vary as a function of the quality of its larval diet (protein + carbohydrate [P + C] content of 8.0%–12.6% w/w, and protein‐to‐carbohydrate [P/C] ratio of 1.8–0.11) across extreme levels of conspecific larval densities (60–600 larvae/60 g of diet). Overall, we found positive effects on survival of immature and adult stages, the duration of the larval stage, pupal weight and adult emergence of flies, as dietary P + C content increased, followed by negative effects when the diet had extremely high carbohydrate‐biased macronutrient content. Larval density had positive, negative and curvilinear effects depending on the macronutrient composition of the food, resulting in a range of fly responses through a continuous scale of macronutrient content and larval density combinations. Optimal performance of A. ludens, in terms of larval development time, body weight and survival to adulthood, was found when the diet consisted of low P + C content and high P/C ratios, and low larval densities. Our findings point to a diet‐mediated relationship between density and survival to the adult stage, suggesting that large numbers (up to a point) of larvae can balance negative effects of conspecific competition when food is characterised by high macronutrient content and low P/C ratios. We conclude that diet quality and conspecific density interact in complex ways to shape trait expression and performance in a frugivorous fly. Addressing this interaction is key to advance the understanding of the mechanisms behind changes in population dynamics in insect species living in groups confined in isolated and ephemeral resources.

TITLE: Biological invasion modifies the co‐occurrence patterns of insects along a stress gradient
ABSTRACT: Summary Biological invasions have become one of the most important drivers of biodiversity loss and ecosystem change world‐wide. However, it is still unclear how invasions may interact with local abiotic stressors, which are expected to increase as global change intensifies. Furthermore, we know little about the response to biological invasions of insects, despite their disproportionate contribution to global animal biodiversity. The aim of the present work is to investigate the impact of an invasive aquatic insect on the co‐occurrence patterns of native species of insects along a salinity gradient, and determine which assembly rules are driving these patterns. First, we characterised the habitat specialisation and functional niches of each species from physiological and biological traits, respectively, and their degree of overlap. Second, we used field data to compare the co‐occurrence patterns of native and invasive species in invaded and non‐invaded areas of southern Iberia and northern Morocco. Finally, we tested if habitat filtering or niche differentiation assembly rules mediate their co‐occurrence. In non‐invaded areas, habitat filtering drives habitat segregation of species along the salinity gradient, with a lower contribution of niche differentiation. The presence of the invasive insect modifies the distribution and co‐occurrence patterns of native species. In invaded areas, niche differentiation seems to be the main mechanism to avoid competition among the invasive and native species, enabling coexistence and resource partitioning. The combined study of functional niche similarity and abiotic stressor tolerance of invasive and native species can improve our understanding of the effects of invasive species along abiotic stress gradients. This approach may increase our capacity to predict the outcomes of biological invasion in a global change context. A lay summary is available for this article.

TITLE: REPRODUCTIVE ECOLOGY AND MATING SUCCESS OF MALE LIMNONECTES KUHLII, A FANGED FROG FROM TAIWAN
ABSTRACT: The reproductive ecology and mating success of male Limnonectes kuhlii, one of the fanged frogs which are characterized by a suite of unusual sexually dimorphic traits (males have larger body, head, and fang sizes than females), were studied under natural conditions in subtropical Taiwan in order to clarify the role of sexual selection on male body size. There were no significant temporal peaks in the number of adult males or amplexed females observed along an 81-m transect of a small creek throughout a 3-mo study period. The nightly sex ratio was highly male biased. Over the study period, the distribution pattern of males showed a significant tendency toward clumping at oviposition sites (represented as oviposition sections of the creek where females laid eggs). During the nights, males usually showed a nonclumped distribution pattern along the transect, probably due to male-male interactions mediated through vocalization and physical combat, including vigorous biting. The calling sites of males were considered as breeding territories and sites of oviposition. Larger males often changed their nightly position along the transect, whereas smaller males remained at the same sites over the study period. The number of different oviposition sections in which each male was present over the study period ranged from 0–11 and was positively correlated with male body size. The number of matings by each male ranged from 0–9, and 42% of the males mated at least once. Male mating success was positively correlated with six male traits that included body size and the number of nights present. However, multivariate analysis revealed that a direct factor determining male mating success was the number of different oviposition sites which a male visited. This study also demonstrated that large-male mating advantage in L. kuhlii occurred indirectly through the size-dependent spatial movement pattern. A large body size in male L. kuhlii seems to have evolved through intrasexual selection (male-male competition by physical combat) in the context of a resource-defense polygyny mating system.

In particular, the effects of multiple fish predators on food webs are difficult to predict due to the prevalence of omnivory and intraguild predation. At the same time, many ecosystems experience high nutrient loads that fuel food webs from the bottom up. To test the combined effects of both multiple predators and nutrient enrichment on food web composition, we created monocultures of perch, roach, and stickleback as well as mixed assemblages of all 3 species at 3 different density levels using an additive design, and induced nutrient enrichment in half of the cages. The biomass of invertebrate herbivores and algae was measured. Stomach analyses of predators were used to detect prey switching. Herbivore biomass depended mainly on predator identity, while top-down effects on algae were mediated by predator density and nutrient enrichment. Specifically, perch strongly reduced amphipods and isopods, and roach mainly reduced gastropods but also isopods, while stickleback had weak overall effects on herbivores. These species-specific effects were attenuated in the mixed fish assemblages, probably due to prey switching. Algal growth strongly increased under high fish density and nutrient enrichment, but was not affected by predator-induced changes in the herbivore composition. This study shows that identity effects from predators in isolation are attenuated in multiple predator assemblages, probably due to increasing interference among the predators. Algal biomass was enhanced by nutrient enrichment and high predator density, which affected algae probably through non-lethal effects, such as reduced activity of the herbivores.

TITLE: Intransitivity increases plant functional diversity by limiting dominance in drylands worldwide
ABSTRACT: Abstract Biotic interactions are key determinants of plant community structure. Indirect interactions such as intransitivity (i.e., the absence of competitive hierarchies among species) have been hypothesized to benefit diversity within plant communities. However, their effect on functional diversity remains scarcely explored in real communities. Here, we develop a novel approach to infer intransitivity from plant spatial patterns and functional traits (height and specific leaf area) and quantify its effect on different components of plant diversity along environmental gradients in 100 drylands from all continents except Antarctica. We first calculated the spatial association pattern for all perennials to infer competition between species. Trait values were used as a proxy of competitive hierarchies to infer the direction of these interactions. We used multiple regression models to evaluate how intransitivity responds to environmental variables (mean annual temperature and precipitation, precipitation seasonality, soil pH, sand content and woody cover). We also used confirmatory path analysis to evaluate the effects of intransitivity on species richness and evenness, trait dispersion and functional diversity. Intransitivity mostly responded to climatic variables and significantly increased with precipitation scarcity and seasonality. We found that intransitivity had significant effects on functional diversity, mostly by promoting plant community evenness. However, the dominance of woody vegetation (steppes versus shrublands) modulated this effect. Synthesis. Intransitivity increased the functional diversity of drylands, particularly under high rainfall seasonality, by limiting functionally dominant species. Our findings specify how intransitivity structures the functional diversity of dryland vegetation worldwide. Intransitivity may be particularly important in ecosystems where the availability of abiotic resources changes over time, thereby breaking down inherent competitive hierarchies between plant species. Neglecting intransitivity will bias our estimation of the impacts of biotic interactions on plant communities, a fundamental issue to fully understand how plant communities will respond to ongoing environmental changes.

TITLE: Exploring multitrophic interactions in oilseed rape fields reveals the prevailing role of Carabidae
ABSTRACT: In cropped fields, birds are often at the highest position in the food chain, feeding on pest arthropods and their intermediate predators in a process known as intraguild predation. The net effects of bird predation on phytophagous insect populations (feeding on plants) are difficult to predict without comprehensively describing prey-predator communities and their complex interplay. We sampled bird and arthropod communities in 30 oilseed rape fields in the spring of 2019 and 2020 in France. To assess the top-down control of arthropods by birds, we used a vertebrate exclusion experiment. Using a taxonomic and functional trait-based approach, we determined the direct and indirect influences of birds on arthropod predators and phytophagous insect populations in arable crops. We observed a negative relationship between the abundance of Carabidae and phytophagous insects but not with the other predator group suggesting the key role of Carabidae on phytophagous insects in agroecosystem. We found no statistical evidence of intraguild predation from birds toward intermediate predators. Despite the lack of overall effect of predator functional diversity on their prey, we highlighted the negative relationship between the functional complementarity (through functional evenness) of Carabidae and the abundance of phytophagous insects. This result suggests that functional complementarity between Carabidae species could help to reduce phytophagous insect populations. We analyzed the effect of agricultural practices on these multitrophic interactions, showing that pesticide intensity only had detrimental effects on Carabidae abundance, while the frequency of tillage did not affect the studied communities. Complementary indices used to depict communities are helpful to better understand the mechanisms underlying trophic relationships.

TITLE: The Influence of Competition Trait-Mediated Effects on Intra-Guild Predation System
ABSTRACT: 
 Parasitism can affect the population dynamics in many ways, and its indirect effect is easy to be ignored, that is, it can weaken the host's behavior, physiology and psychology to affect the whole population. In this paper, we build a differential equation model by adding four parameters to study the influence of multiple competitive relationships on the predator-prey system, It includes the enhancement effect g of intraspecific competition and the enhancement effect h of interspecific competition between susceptible population and infected population, the weakening effect m of intraspecific competition and the weakening effect n of interspecific competition between susceptible population and infected population. Through the analysis, it can be concluded that a single g or m can promote the symbiosis of predator and prey, a single h has little effect on the population dynamics, and a single n is not conducive to the symbiosis; The fusion of g and h promotes coexistence, but the fusion of m and n is on the contrary; Interestingly, the combination of multiple regulatory parameters has a chemical effect on the survival of species, but the combination of g, m and h can inhibit coexistence, while the combination of g, m and n can promote coexistence. The reason is that the combination of parameters is not a simple addition of effects, but a prerequisite for mutual influence. To sum up, the research content provides a reference for considering the role of multiple factors, and provides theoretical guidance for explaining ecological phenomena and proving ecological conclusions.

TITLE: Positive effect of shade on plant growth: amelioration of stress or active regulation of growth rate?
ABSTRACT: Summary 1. While plant competition for light has received considerable attention, the facilitative effect that shading can have on plants and the role of species‐specific adaptations in mediating this phenomenon are still poorly understood. Evidence is accumulating, however, that positive interactions can play as important a role in community structuring as has been shown for competition. 2. We examined interspecific variation in growth responses to shade using 46 temperate grassland species grown for 10 weeks in a common garden under identical soil conditions but at different levels of shading. The importance of morphological plasticity and habitat preference as species traits determining the net effect of shading on plant growth was tested. 3. Moderate shade (50% daylight) had, on average, a net facilitative effect on plant mass. Plant growth in the 25% daylight treatment was not significantly different from that in full daylight, and it was only when 90% of natural light was made unavailable that shaded plants attained a significantly lower dry mass than plants in full daylight. 4. Species that exhibited the most pronounced reduction in specific leaf area and increased allocation to roots in full compared with 50% daylight were least facilitated by shading. This finding supports the hypothesis that morphological plasticity is an important trait determining the strength of facilitative interactions. 5. The growth response to shade was also dependent on species’ ecological optima, with species characteristic of nutrient‐poor or dry habitats most facilitated by shade. Greater growth enhancement by shade in grassland stress‐tolerant plants is surprising because such species frequently occupy unproductive vegetation with little shade and should therefore be adapted to high irradiance. This result calls into question the notion that a positive effect of shade on growth always reflects stress amelioration. 6. Synthesis. Our study demonstrates a widespread ability of plant species to decouple growth from resource availability and challenges our understanding of the processes determining plant productivity.

TITLE: Disentangling multiple predator effects in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning research
ABSTRACT: M. O’Connor & J. Bruno (2009) Predator richness has no effect in a diverse marine food web. Journal of Animal Ecology, 78, 732–740. Disentangling the effects of predator loss can be complex as predators exert a suite of direct and indirect effects in ecosystems. O’Connor & Bruno manipulated predator abundance, richness, and composition in experiments with and without prey dispersal in an estuarine ecosystem. They observed effects of predator presence and composition on prey assemblages, particularly in experiments without prey dispersal, but they found no effect of predator richness on prey assemblage. Here, we discuss the role of non-additive, antagonistic, and spatial effects of predators in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning experiments, with a particular focus on the results of O’Connor & Bruno. Predators are disproportionately threatened by human activities relative to other trophic groups (Pauly et al. 1998; Duffy 2003) and predator extinctions can have cascading effects in ecosystems (e.g. Terborgh et al. 2001; Duffy 2003). The strength of these effects varies among ecosystems (Shurin et al. 2002) and depends on the assemblage of predators present (Bruno & Cardinale 2008). Given current rates of biodiversity loss, there is a sense of urgency to develop a better understanding of the functional consequences of biodiversity loss in different ecosystems. Most biodiversity and ecosystem functioning studies, however, focus on sessile organisms because mobile organisms, like predators, are much more difficult to control, like herbaceaus plants (Duffy et al. 2007). Studies that investigate the effects of predators in ecosystems usually focus on the direct effects of a single predator species on prey and the subsequent indirect or cascading effects on producers (Hairston, Smith, & Slobodkin 1960; Oksanen et al. 1981; Carpenter, Kitchell, & Hodgson 1985). A growing number of studies are now investigating the effects of predator richness in ecosystems (reviewed in Duffy et al. 2007), but these studies are often limited to small spatial scales and few species. Natural ecosystems are complex (Polis & Strong 1996) and presently, we have resolved the complete web of trophic interactions in only a few cases. Consequently, we currently lack a synthetic understanding of the multiple effects of predators in ecosystems (Fig. 1). In this issue of the Journal of Animal Ecology, O’Connor & Bruno (2009) designed field and mesocosm experiments to disentangle the effects of predator abundance, diversity, and composition on diverse prey assemblages in a subtidal estuarine food web in Bogue Sound, North Carolina, USA. Conceptual diagram of the multiple effects of predators in ecosystems. Consumptive effects are represented with solid lines, nonconsumptive effects are represented with dashed lines, and spatial effects are represented with dotted lines. 1, Direct consumption; 2, trait-mediated, nonlethal interactions; 3, omnivory; 4, trophic cascades; 5, nutrient recycling; 6, intraspecific interference; 7, intraguild predation; 8, competition; and 9, spatial subsidies. O’Connor & Bruno (2009) measured direct consumption (1) and partially controlled for intraguild predation (7). O’Connor & Bruno's (2009) study system is ideal for experimental manipulation because it harbours a diverse predator assemblage (10 species) and a high diversity of amphipod, isopod, and gastropod prey species (52), which have rapid demographic responses to changes in predation and habitat quality. O’Connor & Bruno (2009) designed two field experiments where prey species were able to disperse and one mesocosm experiment that was closed to prey dispersal. Their study is one of the few experiments to vary prey dispersal and predator diversity and composition simultaneously, although they did not control prey dispersal. Predator presence reduced prey density by at least half and reduced prey richness by one to six species but both effects depended on the predator species present. Overall, shrimp presence had the strongest effects on prey density and richness. In two of the experiments predator presence also significantly shifted prey composition. For example, in the presence of shrimp the relative abundance of the amphipod, Elasmopus levis, more than doubled whereas the relative abundance of the isopod, Paracerceis caudata, decreased by threefold. These effects were strongest in the mesocosm experiment, where prey dispersal did not occur. This suggests that prey dispersal may dampen the effects of multiple predators on prey, although these results are confounded by the fact that prey diversity was also lowest in the mesocosm experiment. O’Connor & Bruno (2009) did not find a significant effect of predator richness on prey density, richness, or composition. Here we explore two potential reasons why O’Connor & Bruno (2009) did not observe an effect of predator richness on prey assemblages: (i) non-additive, antagonistic interactions between predators, and (ii) spatial effects. Sih, Englund, & Wooster (1998) defined three categories of multiple-predator effects: linear (i.e. substitutable and additive), risk enhancing (i.e. synergistic) or risk reducing (i.e. antagonistic). Non-additive, antagonistic interactions between predators are frequent (Finke & Denno 2005; Schmitz 2007; Bruno & Cardinale 2008), and theory demonstrates that these interactions can decrease the per capita capture rates of predator species and dampen the effects of multiple predators on prey assemblages (Ives, Cardinale, & Snyder 2005; Casula, Wilby & Thomas 2006). Interference, intraguild predation, and nonlethal interactions are common non-additive, antagonistic interactions (Schmitz 2007). For example, Finke & Denno (2005) observed that intraguild predation dampened the effects of predators (i.e. spiders, beetles) on herbivores (i.e. planthoppers) and producers (i.e. cordgrass) in a salt-marsh mesocosm study. O’Connor & Bruno (2009) held predator density constant in all their experiments and to limit the effects of intraguild predation, they checked each enclosure at least twice during the experiments and replaced missing predators. They were able to estimate the potential magnitude of density-mediated intraguild predation but they were not able to quantify the trait-mediated, nonlethal effects of intraguild predators in experimental cages. Shrimps were the most common victim of intraguild predation but they also had the strongest, negative effects on prey density relative to other predators in monoculture and they significantly reduced prey richness, evenness, and composition as described above. As a result, intraguild predation on shrimps may have played the same role as an additional trophic level controlling the most efficient consumers in this system, i.e., it generated a negative selection effect that opposed any complementarity effect among predators (Loreau & Hector 2001; Thébault & Loreau 2003). Furthermore, predators can have both density- and trait-mediated effects on prey species (e.g. Schmitz 2003); therefore, we should expect that the presence of an intraguild predator may also have the potential to cause trait-mediated indirect effects on the predators they consume. The presence of nonlethal interactions between predators in the O’Connor & Bruno (2009) experiments, however, may have been limited because prey did not have access to refuge area. Conversely, the potential for intraguild predation to dampen the effects of predator richness on prey assemblages appears to be strong in this ecosystem. The flow of energy, material, and organisms across ecosystems, most commonly referred to as allochthonous inputs or spatial subsidies, is ubiquitous (Polis, Anderson & Holt 1997; Loreau, Mouquet & Holt 2003). Theory and experiments that incorporate spatial flows can be complex but offer new insights into the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. For example, McCann, Rasmussen, & Umbanhowar (2005) provided empirical data and theoretical analysis to demonstrate that mobile predators can couple distinct patches and stabilize complex ecosystems. Similarly, Nakano & Murakami (2001) demonstrated a strong reliance of aquatic (i.e. fish) and terrestrial (i.e. birds) consumers on subsidies during different times of the year. O’Connor & Bruno (2009) found limited differences between the experiments that allowed prey dispersal and the one that did not. In the field experiments, prey were able to disperse to and from the regional species pool; therefore, we would expect dampened effects of caged predators because of quick replacement of lost prey within the inclusion cages. A thorough understanding of who eats whom, who affects whom in other ways, and the dispersal abilities of different species is critical to predicting the effects of diversity in natural ecosystems, particularly for the top of the food chain where indirect effects are common (Fig. 1). O’Connor & Bruno (2009) is part of a group of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning studies that have manipulated predator diversity. Results from these studies demonstrate that multiple predators may have null, additive, antagonistic, or synergistic effects on prey assemblages (Cardinale et al. 2006; Duffy et al. 2007; Bruno & Cardinale 2008). The habitat domain of predator and prey (i.e. spatial movement) and hunting mode of the predator interact to shape the outcome of multiple-predator effects in ecosystems (Schmitz 2007). O’Connor & Bruno's (2009) experiments are limited because they artificially reduced the habitat domain of the predators by preventing predator dispersal. Experiments with spatially constrained designs, such as small enclosures, may facilitate antagonistic effects between predators because predators in constrained habitats may hunt each other (Schmitz 2007). Predator dispersal may create spatial heterogeneity in predator–prey dynamics because predators will be able to actively select areas with preferred food and abandon areas with undesirable food (France & Duffy 2006). This will also enable intraguild prey to find spatial refuges. Densities of prey in these refuge areas may decrease as a result of increased predation pressure (e.g. Schmitz 2003). Natural ecosystems are open to spatial flows at all trophic levels, therefore, future experiments should explicitly test for the effects of predator mobility on prey assemblages. To incorporate predator mobility effectively, the spatial extent of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning experiments will likely have to increase to accommodate the larger foraging spectrum of most predators. Diverse predator assemblages are becoming increasingly rare both on land and at sea. Biodiversity loss at the top of food chains can have strong cascading effects but we still have a rudimentary understanding of these effects in diverse, spatially extended ecosystems. Future studies on the effects of predator diversity in ecosystems should simultaneously consider non-additive and nontrophic interactions and spatial effects of predators in addition to their direct trophic effects through local prey consumption. Schmitz (2007) provides a theoretical framework for incorporating multiple-predator effects in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning experiments. A more thorough understanding of the multiple effects of predator in ecosystems is required to inform conservation and management of biodiversity in our rapidly changing world. We thank C.

TITLE: Individual control over reproduction: an underestimated element in the maintenance of sex?
ABSTRACT: 25) convincingly argue that combining traditional hypotheses on the maintenance of sex into a pluralistic framework provides a more plausible explanation for the enigmatic success of sexuality. By merging (1) more efficient elimination of deleterious mutations with (2) better tracking of environmental changes (often parasites) and allowing for synergism between both, 25) show that sexuality becomes much more robust against invasion by asexuality. Their approach abandons traditional attempts to find a single and sufficient explanation for sex. However, once accepting that a mixture of ingredients may be the best recipe to explain sex, we strongly suggest adding at least one more component. Here, we argue that the pluralistic approach ( 25) could be further strengthened by not concentrating solely on population-level processes, but by encompassing the important role that individuals may play. We focus on two assumptions that population geneticists often make and that are inherent to the hypotheses within the pluralistic framework, namely that offspring are produced (1) randomly and (2) without paternal care. Under these assumptions, offspring produced by a sexual female can be represented as a quality array of randomly produced progeny in a 1:1 sex ratio ( Fig. 1, bold lines). For asexuals, this distribution is compressed to a single all-female class with some small variance due to mutation (not shown). Sex is favoured when the advantage of producing few, better adapted and less mutation-loaded offspring outweighs the cost of producing males plus the cost of producing low-fitness offspring. Under random mating, high-quality sexual individuals lose most as they are likely to have relatively poorer mates, whereas low-quality individuals will benefit as they are likely to have better mates. This equalizing effect limits the benefits of sex. Distribution of offspring quality that a sexual individual can expect to produce. Bold curve: sample distribution under random mating (shape arbitrarily chosen). (A–C) Three ways in which individuals can improve offspring fitness (dashed lines): (A) by selecting better mates, (B) by obtaining help in raising offspring and (C) by differential treatment of offspring. Option A is the only one that can move the upper range of the distribution. Options B and C can improve the shape of the distribution, but only within the set range. Options B and C are also available to asexuals, but since they start out with a very narrow distribution (not shown), the scope for improvement is accordingly limited. However sex is not usually random. Sexual individuals can actively influence the quality of their progeny ( Fig. 1, dashed lines) and data from behavioural ecology suggest that they do this specifically in an attempt to capitalize on the benefits and reduce the costs of recombination. This results in a net advantage of sexuality at the population level. We suggest four processes sexual individuals have at their disposal to improve offspring quality and quantity. The first two (sexual selection and paternal care) are inherently linked since their strengths are inversely correlated ( 21). The third one is specific for animals that can reduce the cost of producing males. The fourth summarizes post-zygotic effects. Differential selection on individuals for access to mates through mate choice and competition for mates is known to be particularly strong on traits that indicate parasite resistance and/or mutation load (often measured as developmental instability) ( 11; 17). Nonrandom mating in relation to these traits gives parents the possibility of actively choosing the appropriate mate to obtain offspring with fewer mutations and/or a better genome–environment match than under random mating ( Fig. 1A; A. J. Pemberton, in preparation). For example, mammals actively choose mates of dissimilar MHC genotype and thereby increase the genetic variation in the immune response system of their offspring ( 13). Choosiness is particularly important for high-quality individuals in order to prevent their offspring from sliding back to a given population mean. The resultant assortative mating within this ‘upper class’ may force low-quality individuals to accept mates of a lower than average quality. At the population level, sexual selection has the potential to flatten the quality distribution of the progeny produced, thereby increasing exposure of deleterious mutations and enhancing the genotype–environment match in the next generation. If parent quality affects offspring number in addition to quality, sexual selection may also result in a larger skew towards fewer low-quality and more high-quality progeny. Sexual selection is ubiquitous ( 3) and takes place at all conceivable levels: from precopulatory interactions between individuals ( 2) down to post-copulatory selection through sperm and pollen competition ( 4) or cryptic female choice (Eberhard, 1995). Parents may be able to select their own gametes. In mice, mutant spermatocytes appear to be selectively eliminated during spermatogenesis ( 22). There is also growing evidence for nonrandom fusion of oocytes with sperm. For example, the combination of MHC alleles in eggs and sperm affects the fertilization efficiency ( 23; 20). In addition to MHC-dependent mate choice (review by 13) all this indicates active control over disease resistance in progeny, resulting in a better genome–environment match. Males are the main cost of sex, since the production of sons reduces a sexual population’s intrinsic growth rate by a factor two ( 16). However, this only applies when males are mere sperm donors. When they also provide resources, they can increase the number of progeny a female produces, up to the point at which they may cancel out this two-fold cost. Although both low- and high-quality offspring may benefit equally from paternal care ( Fig. 1B), it is the increased number of high-quality offspring that matters most, as it is this category that potentially enhances the spread of fitter gene combinations. In addition to support from males, a female can also receive help from her own offspring. Since helpers are not exposed to sexual selection while helping, they may be of use even if unfit for reproduction themselves, thus reducing the cost of producing low-quality offspring through sexuality. Although asexual females may cash in on male assistance in sexual populations as well, males will be under strong selection to recognize asexuals or their (all-female) broods ( 15). Refined assessment of females may already be in place since males that invest heavily in offspring will be under selection to distinguish cheating from faithful sexual females (see below). Individual control over sex allocation is well developed in haplodiploid organisms ( 26). Here the sex ratio is typically skewed towards females to reduce local mate competition between brothers ( 10). As a consequence, the cost of males is also reduced. A female-biased sex allocation is also known from many hermaphrodites (e.g. 19), and is expected when matings are rare ( 8) or when sexuality includes some selfing ( 6). Alternatively, asexuals arisen from hermaphroditic ancestors may not have shut down their male function completely, and still pay the cost of male allocation ( 24). All these mechanisms will reduce the cost of reproduction in sexuals relative to that in asexuals, making asexual modes of reproduction less likely. Parents also have post-zygotic mechanisms at their disposal to improve average offspring quality. First, by cutting investment in poor offspring, there are more resources for fitter progeny, skewing the distribution of offspring quality in favour of the fittest ( Fig. 1C). Selective abortion is a first mechanism to achieve this. There is actually evidence for higher abortion rates in humans among MHC-similar couples ( 1), suggesting that investment in offspring with a less variable (presumably less flexible) immune system is avoided. Second, young may be fed differentially after birth. Third, parents may put an upper limit on overall investment and induce competition among their progeny, which again results in quality-dependent allocation of resources. Even when parents are completely ignorant about offspring quality within a brood, less fit young may serve as food for fitter sibs. Finally, a female that reproduces repeatedly may make maternal investment in each single brood dependent on the quality of the likely father of that brood, thus economizing resource allocation over her lifetime ( 18). There appear to be many ways in which individual behaviour can increase the benefits of sex beyond the random mating expectation. Empirical data from behavioural ecology indicate that nonrandomness is strong and widespread in sexual species. 21) pointed out that the strength of sexual selection (our first point) is inversely related to the extent of paternal care (our second point). This is because males that do not offer paternal care, and can afford to spend more on attracting mates or fighting off rivals. It means that from our first two sets of mechanisms, at least one is likely to apply to any given system. It can therefore be no surprise that the mechanisms listed above have now been documented in many and diverse species groups, and are manifested at very basic levels, such as spermatogenesis or sperm–egg interactions. Moreover, they represent such direct advantages for the individual that employs them, that there must be strong selection in favour of them. The mere fact that individuals appear to base mating decisions on environmental adaptation and mutation load actually supports the pluralistic paradigm proposed by 25). Looking at what individuals do may therefore offer an alternative approach to quantify the relative importance of mutations vs. genotype–environment matches. ‘Individual quality-control’ should be seen as a magnifying glass that exposes small defects in potential sexual partners. Importantly, it anticipates natural selection by parasites or mutations by stressing and unveiling unfavourable genotypes before they enter the next generation. As a result, sexual populations may actually be much fitter (and evolving faster) than expected under random mating, and the advantage asexuals need to compete with sexuals should accordingly be higher. For all these reasons, we think that ‘individual quality-control’ deserves a central place in a pluralistic theory of sex. One cautionary note should be added at this point. Sexual reproduction results in a number of conflicts during reproduction because the parties, parents and offspring, are not genetically identical. These conflicts may reduce the efficiency of the mechanisms we propose. For instance, offspring may attempt to deceive their parents into believing that they are actually the best or most needy of food. But here selection for honest signals in progeny could reduce the risk. Similarly, the work on conflicts between males and females regarding certainty of paternity and paternal care ( 12) takes on a new light in this context. In these cases of conflict, the extent to which females can deceive males will be directly related to the degree to which sexual selection and paternal care act in unison. However, when males win, as is the case with paternally imprinted genes ( 9), the cost of sex can actually be higher. Note that co-operative behaviour and offspring selection are two mechanisms that asexuals also have at their disposal to improve their reproductive success ( 5; 14). Yet, the potential advantage may be much smaller. First, in co-operative asexuals resources are primarily needed to produce own eggs and helping will be reduced to providing access to common resources or sharing common tasks such as alertness or defence. A helping male, on the other hand, does not invest in eggs, and will be able to provide his female not only with services, but also with resources that may allow her to produce more offspring. Second, genetic variance among asexual offspring is so limited that the maximum benefit of offspring screening is accordingly narrow for an asexual female. Although most theoretical studies of the evolution of sexuality have actually acknowledged that nonrandom mating or parental care may influence the outcome of their models, the importance of these phenomena has always been minimized. We hope that pluralism at the population level will also lead to open-mindedness about the constituent individuals. We would specifically like to thank the invited speakers and participants that attended the Summer School on the Evolution of Sex in Seewiesen (1997) for stimulating discussions. We also thank John Bishop, Letizia Gerace, Angel Martin Alganza, Norbert Pongratz, Tim Sharbel, Thomas Staedler and Martin Storhas for critically discussing the manuscript of West et al. with us.

TITLE: Commentary: Novel competitors shape species' responses to climate change
ABSTRACT: Citation: Fadrique B and Feeley KJ (2016) Commentary: Novel competitors shape species' responses to climate change. There is a growing appreciation of the need to understand the effects of climate change on species interactions and how changes in interactions can influence the ability of species to persist in the face of climate change (Araújo and Luoto, 2007; Thuiller et al., 2008; Svenning et al., 2014). However, empirical or experimental studies investigating species interactions under climate change remain extremely scarce. Alexander et al. (2015) use experimental transplants of European alpine plant species and communities to provide valuable insight into some of the novel competitive interactions that may emerge as species migrate upslope to keep pace with rising temperatures. More specifically, they look at performance of plant species under simulated upslope migrations into preexisting higher-elevation plant communities as well as the performance of plant species that fail to migrate and find themselves competing with new suites of species migrating into their community from below. This is a useful approximation of some of the scenarios that are already being created by the unequal responses of species to climate and the creation of novel communities. One limitation of the study by Alexander et al. (2015) is the omission of the earliest phases of establishment when processes such as dispersal and germination are crucial in the encroachment of initial populations of migrant species into the new locations (Hampe, 2011). In particular, the experimental set up fails to account for one of the potentially most important drivers of community assembly—priority effects. Priority effects refer to the observation that early colonists will often inhibit, or alternatively facilitate, the establishment of subsequent colonizers (Connell and Slatyer, 1977). The concept of priority effect has been assimilated into community assembly theory to explain the fact that some communities may exist in alternative stable states depending on the timing and order of the arriving species and their traits, such as competitive ability or fecundity (Young et al., 2001). Priority effects can facilitate establishment of new species through changes in the environment or mutualisms. For example, in alpine communities, cushion plants can ameliorate environmental conditions and thereby increase the survival of other species leading to higher species richness (Cavieres et al., 2014). On the other hand, inhibitory priority effects can occur through legacies in the plant-soil feedbacks (Grman and Suding, 2010) or size-mediated priority effects and asymmetric competition (Weiner, 1990; Rasmussen et …

TITLE: Water‐use efficiency and relative growth rate mediate competitive interactions in Sonoran Desert winter annual plants
ABSTRACT: • Premise of the study: A functional approach to investigating competitive interactions can provide a mechanistic understanding of processes driving population dynamics, community assembly, and the maintenance of biodiversity. In Sonoran Desert annual plants, a trade‐off between relative growth rate (RGR) and water‐use efficiency (WUE) contributes to species differences in population dynamics that promote long‐term coexistence. Traits underlying this trade‐off explain variation in demographic responses to precipitation as well as life history and phenological patterns. Here, we ask how these traits mediate competitive interactions. • Methods: We conducted competition trials for three species occupying different positions along the RGR–WUE trade‐off axis and compared the effects of competition at high and low soil moisture. We compared competitive effect (ability to suppress neighbors) and competitive response (ability to withstand competition from neighbors) among species. • Key results: The RGR–WUE trade‐off predicted shifts in competitive responses at different soil moistures. The high‐RGR species was more resistant to competition in high water conditions, while the opposite was true for the high‐WUE species. The intermediate RGR species tended to have the strongest impact on all neighbors, so competitive effects did not scale directly with differences in RGR and WUE among competitors. • Conclusions: Our results reveal mechanisms underlying long‐term variation in fitness: high‐RGR species perform better in years with large, frequent rain events and can better withstand competition under wetter conditions. The opposite is true for high‐WUE species. Such resource‐dependent responses strongly influence community dynamics and can promote coexistence in variable environments.

TITLE: The shape of the predator biomass distribution affects biological pest control services in agricultural landscapes
ABSTRACT: Abstract Understanding how community composition of service‐providing organisms affects ecosystem functioning is a key challenge in ecology. Although it has been proposed that taxonomic diversity and functional traits mediate this relationship, how several facets of community structure affect the delivery of key ecosystem services remains to be explored. In this study, we investigated how abundance, taxonomic richness as well as the shape of biomass distribution in predator communities affect biological pest control services in vineyard landscapes. Our analyses were based on a dataset combining samples of arthropod predators, measures of predation rates of grape pests and characterization of environmental covariables for 42 fields located in South‐Western France. We found that beside the abundance or the taxonomic richness of predators, the shape of biomass distribution (mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis of the distribution) influences the level of biological control. Predator communities largely dominated by low biomass species provided the bulk of biological control services. Lower levels of predation resulted from increased proportions of large biomass species and more evenly distributed biomass values in the communities. Our results indicate that the top‐down control provided by low biomass species decreases as the relative proportion of large biomass species increases in the predator community. This suggests that biological control may be affected by negative interactions (e.g. intraguild predation, behavioural interactions) between predators arising from the recruitment of large individuals in the community. Our study revealed that the shape of biomass distribution is a major aspect of functional diversity in predator communities providing insights into the mechanisms that link biodiversity and ecosystem services. While our study focuses on biomass, considering other traits involved in trophic interactions may increase our ability to predict the level of biological control in ecosystems.

TITLE: Maternal antibodies in a wild altricial bird: effects on offspring immunity, growth and survival.
ABSTRACT: 1. In many animals immunity is not fully developed until adulthood but the young still need protection against various sets of pathogens. Thus, bird nestlings are highly dependent on antibodies received from their mother (in the eggs) during their rapid early growth period. The relationship between maternal immunity and the development of neonates' own immunity has been poorly studied. 2. It has been suggested that immune function plays an important part in mediating resource competition between different life-history traits, e.g. growth and reproduction. Maternal investment of antibodies has potentially permanent effects on offspring phenotype. Thus, the trade-offs between the immune function and other important life-history traits in the offspring will also affect the fitness of the mother. 3. Our supplemental feeding experiment in the magpie Pica pica indicates that the immunoglobulin levels of offspring at hatching are dependent on a mother's nutritional condition. In addition, the amount of maternal immunoglobulins transferred to offspring increases along the laying order within a nest. 4. We also found that at the age of 8-10 days the immunoglobulin production of the offspring has already begun. Furthermore, the maternal immunoglobulin levels of the offspring at hatching were positively related to their immunoglobulin levels on day 10. 5. Maternal immunoglobulins did not significantly affect offspring growth, but there was a negative relationship between self-produced immunoglobulins and growth over the first 10 days, indicating a trade-off between these traits. Nestlings' weight, however, had a positive relationship with immunoglobulin production suggesting that the observed trade-off between growth and immunoglobulin production is due to catch-up growth of nestlings with a low hatching weight. We found that within nests nestlings with higher maternal antibody levels had higher survival rate until day 20, but between nests there was an opposite relationship. 6. Evidently, there is a trade-off, in magpies, between maternal resources, immune function and growth, shaping the evolution of maternal investment in offspring immunity.

TITLE: Foraging behaviour of brown trout in wild populations: can population density cause behaviourally-mediated foraging specializations?
ABSTRACT: Brown trout is considered as a territorial fish, in which negative density effects on growth and survival rates can be mediated through competition mechanisms. Here, in order to examine whether competition mechanisms can affect the foraging behaviour of wild Salmo trutta with respect to active-bottom, benthic-drift or surface-drift foraging, three neighbouring populations under different levels of fish density (high, intermediate and low) were studied. We analysed the foraging behaviour of each population according to niche breadth, prey preferences, the modified Costello graphical method and prey trait analysis. The results revealed a remarkable similarity in the feeding behaviour among these feral fish populations, suggesting a foraging behaviour convergence in response to site-specific prey accessibility. A generalist foraging behaviour was the prevailing feeding strategy, independent of fish density. Hence, this study offered evidence for the occurrence of density-independent individual foraging behaviour when food is abundant and available; however, density-dependent foraging behaviour might occur when resource limitation exists. Studies under natural conditions like the present study are needed to increase ecological realism, and indeed this study opens promising research directions for future feeding studies in territorial fish species.

TITLE: Trait-mediated competition drives an ant invasion and alters functional diversity
ABSTRACT: The assumption that differences in species' traits reflect their different niches has long influenced how ecologists infer processes from assemblage patterns. For instance, many assess the importance of environmental filtering versus classical limiting-similarity competition in driving biological invasions by examining whether invaders’ traits are similar or dissimilar to those of residents, respectively. However, mounting evidence suggests that hierarchical differences between species' trait values can distinguish their competitive abilities (e.g. for the same resource) instead of their niches. Whether such trait-mediated hierarchical competition explains invasions and structures assemblages is less explored. We integrate morphological, dietary, physiological and behavioural trait analyses to test whether environmental filtering, limiting-similarity competition or hierarchical competition explain invasions by fire ants on ant assemblages. We detect both competition mechanisms; invasion success is not only explained by limiting similarity in body size and thermal tolerance (presumably allowing the invader to exploit different niches from residents), but also by the invader's superior position in trait hierarchies reflecting competition for common trophic resources. We find that the two mechanisms generate complex assemblage-level functional diversity patterns—overdispersion in some traits, clustering in others—suggesting their effects are likely missed by analyses restricted to a few traits and composite trait diversity measures.

TITLE: Out of sight, out of mind: the impacts of root‐feeding insects in natural and managed systems
ABSTRACT: Data from diverse ecosystems indicate that more than 50% of net primary production is commonly allocated to below-ground plant parts (Coleman, 1976), and values for particular plant species approach 90% (Andersen, 1987). Root biomass can typically vary from under 300 g/m2 to over 4000 g/m2 of soil surface (Rickleffs, 1973) and, however, you look at it, that's a lot of biomass. Although the nutritional value of root tissue is generally lower than that of foliar tissue, we shouldn't be surprised that many species of herbivore, including insects, exploit the roots of plants. What is surprising, however, is the extreme paucity of information on the distribution, abundance and effects of root-feeding insects on plants in natural and managed systems. If we as entomologists were to use our peer-reviewed literature as an indication of the relative allocation by plants to foliage and roots, we would get a shockingly biased picture. Over the last 5 years, for example, Ecological Entomology (5 years) and Agricultural and Forest Entomology (1 year) have published a combined four articles on root-feeding insects in comparison to 288 articles on insects that feed on above-ground plant parts. With this apparent bias in effort, it's little wonder that even basic information on the distribution and abundance of root-feeding insects is missing for most ecosystems (Morón-Ríos et al. 1997). Yet below-ground insect herbivores are known to influence the diversity of plant communities, the rate and direction of succession, competitive interactions among plants, their allocation to different functions, the susceptibility of plants to other herbivores and pathogens and, ultimately, the yield of agricultural and forest systems (below). This paper considers what we do know about the effects of root-feeding insects on plants, and where our major knowledge gaps remain. Its intent is to stimulate discussion and an increase in research efforts on the ecology and management of below-ground insect herbivores. For purposes of brevity, 'root-feeding' is used here as shorthand for consumption of all below-ground tissues, including roots, rhizomes and other storage organs. Removal of root tissue by insect herbivores can result in a diversity of responses in their host plants, varying from changes in root : shoot ratios, through changes in subsequent carbon and nitrogen allocation, to death of the plants. Of course, the effects of root herbivory on plants are not restricted to loss of root tissue. In mixed-grass prairie, for example, root-feeding can reduce annual net primary productivity by 16 times more than is actually consumed (Ingham & Detling, 1990). In both agricultural (Latin & Reed, 1985) and forest (Klepzig et al. 1996) systems, root-feeding insects can introduce plant pathogens that affect survival and yield. There is no clear consensus as to whether loss of biomass from root or shoot tissue has the greatest deleterious effects on plant performance but, in at least one study, removal of root tissue had a greater effect on plant performance than did removal of shoot tissue (Reichman & Smith, 1991). Root herbivores may cause losses in protein from the tap root, a reduction in non-structural carbohydrate root reserves and, subsequently, plant mortality (Godfrey et al. 1987; Dintenfass & Brown, 1988a,1b). However, plants infested by root-feeding insects may also exhibit increases in root nitrogen content and a concomitant reduction in foliar N content, reflecting a redirection of nitrogen to the stronger sink (Steinger & Müller-Schärer, 1992). It would seem important that future studies direct attention to whether differences in experimental results (i.e. increases or decreases in root nitrogen content) reflect differences in the plants under study, the identity of the root herbivores, or other ecological variables. This is the kind of basic information that is still lacking. It seems likely, however, that lumping all root-feeding insects together into a single functional group and expecting them to have similar effects on their host plants may be a considerable oversimplification. In the same way that plants respond differentially to attack by different species or guilds of insect herbivores above ground (Hunter, 2000a) so we should expect differential effects of below-ground herbivores on plant performance. This was aptly demonstrated by Steinger & Müller-Schärer, (1992), who found that root-feeding by the moth Agapeta zoegana on Centaurea maculosa seedlings had no effect on shoot or root mass. By contrast, feeding by the weevil Cyphocleomus achates on the same plant greatly reduced shoot biomass. At least some plants can tolerate significant levels of root herbivory, even under water stress (Dunn & Frommelt, 1998), with compensatory growth replacing root biomass (Schmid et al. 1990). In legumes, there can be compensation for nodule damage by insect herbivores (Quinn & Hall, 1992), although the compensatory mechanisms may be insufficient to prevent reductions in the nitrogen concentrations of tissue. In the legume Medicago sativa, compensatory responses are strong and denodulated plants recover nodule number and nodule biomass within 15 and 22 days, respectively (Quinn & Hall, 1996). Indeed, many plants appear to be adept at re-growing lost root tissue and, as a side note, this may lead us to underestimate the impacts of below-ground herbivores. However, compensation for root loss is not without cost and compensatory root growth in response to below-ground herbivory may often occur at the expense of above-ground net primary production (Andersen, 1987). Losses in above-ground biomass appear to be a common response to root damage by insects. For example, root herbivory on white clover by Sitona flavescens reduces foliar biomass, total nitrogen and carbon contents, and impairs nitrogen fixation (Murray et al. 1996). Likewise, feeding by Cerotoma arcuata larvae on bean roots and nodules reduces plant growth and subsequent yield (Teixeira et al. 1996). As Goldson et al. (1988) point out, compensation is associated with increased respiration rates and depleted carbohydrate reserves within the plant as assimilates from shoot reserves are diverted to satisfy the increased demands of the root system. Moreover, even when vegetative recovery seems to be high, compensation for root damage does not necessarily mean that subsequent reproductive output, competitive ability and nutrient or water uptake will be as high as those of undamaged plants (Detling et al. 1980). At least some of the deleterious effects on plants of root damage are likely to be expressed indirectly through interactions with other organisms and the environment (see below). Given that compensatory root growth may lead us to underestimate the densities and activities of root-feeding insects, we may be most likely to recognize their effects post mortem. For example, root-feeding insects are associated with pine seedling mortality in the south-eastern United States (Mitchell et al. 1991) and Eucalyptus seedling mortality in plantations in India (Nair & Varma, 1985). In a spectacular example, ghost moth caterpillars can cause up to 41% mortality in bush lupine stands in California (Strong et al. 1995) and appear to contribute to the long-term dynamics of lupine populations. However, entomopathogenic nematodes can greatly reduce populations of ghost moth caterpillars and the ultimate effect of root-feeding on bush lupine populations probably reflects complex interactions among many ecological players (Strong et al. 1996, 1999). Interestingly, the fecundity of bush lupines can take 3 years to respond to suppression of below-ground herbivory (Maron, 1998), suggesting that short-term experiments may again underestimate the impact of root-feeding insects on plant populations. Unless root-feeding insects cause substantial crop mortality, or directly attack plant parts that are harvested for economic gain, their impacts on financial yield can be difficult to assess. Nonetheless, some root-feeding insects have been shown to have dramatic effects upon production systems. During the 1990s, black pine weevil, Otiorhynchus sulcatus, progressively became the most serious pest in European ornamental nursery stock and soft fruit production (Labuschagne, 1999). Larvae feed on both roots and crown and the devastating nature of the pest means that the threshold for control may be very low. Its pest status is exacerbated by life-history traits that include a wide range of alternative hosts (weeds and non-crop plants) and a fecundity of between 500 and 1200 eggs per female per season. Like many root-feeding pests, O. sulcatus is difficult to detect during the early stages of outbreak and its densities are hard to monitor. They are also difficult to detect before or during the transportation of soil or nursery stock. Nodule-feeding insects that attack nitrogen-fixing legumes can also be serious pests. Although well-recognized as pests of pulse crops such as peas and beans (O'Keefe et al. 1984), they can also cause economic problems in other production systems. For example, low input grassland systems managed for grazing usually require nitrogen-fixing legumes such as clover (Murray & Clements, 1999) that are useful both as a nitrogen source for the soil and as forage for livestock. Many agricultural soils are also enriched by the planting of legumes as 'green manure' (P. F. Hendrix, personal communication). Weevils in the genus Sitona seem to be particularly important pests in such systems as a consequence of nodule feeding by young larvae and root-feeding by older larvae. In fact, Sitona lineatus, distributed throughout Europe and in the western United States, is responsible for serious losses in yield to both edible legumes and forage legumes (Jackson, 1920; Oschmann, 1984). Again, estimates of yield losses may often be underestimated because of the difficulties associated with measuring damage by larvae. In addition to such well-known pests as corn rootworm and cabbage root fly, root-feeding insects influence many other production systems. These include the turf grass industry, where both yield and aesthetic quality affect economic value (Crutchfield & Potter, 1995), and apple, orchards where root-feeding aphids can reduce tree growth and the number and weight of fruit per tree (Brown et al. 1995). Given the ability of some below-ground herbivores to depress plant growth and reproduction, it is not surprising that they are often evaluated as potential biological control agents of weed pests (Müller-Schärer, 1991; Blossey, 1993; Sheppard et al. 1995; Harris & Clapperton, 1997; Schwarzlaender, 1997). In a well-studied example, control of Senecio jacobaea in California has been maintained over the long-term by the combined activities of a defoliating moth and a root-feeding flea beetle (Pemberton & Turner, 1990). Control of root-feeding insects in production systems is hampered, in part, by the difficulties of detection and access. Simply put, it is difficult to know when intervention is required and even more difficult to target a substantial proportion of the pest population with the chosen method of control. Some measure of success against the black pine weevil has been achieved using glue-coated barriers and trap cropping with favoured plant species (Labuschagne, 1999). Biological control of this and other root pests using entomopathogenic nematodes may provide the most promise (Kakouli et al. 1997), given that they may be specific to the pest and can be applied through a variety of measures including irrigation systems. Entomopathogenic nematodes also appear to be important mortality agents in some natural systems (Strong et al. 1996, 1999), suggesting that their life-histories are well-suited for exploitation as agents of control. The jury is still out on the effectiveness of general predators as biological control agents of root-feeding insects. Carabid ground beetles would appear to have significant potential as control agents, but their reported impact on pests such as the cabbage root fly (Hughes, 1959; Coaker & Williams, 1963) may have been overestimated (Finch & Elliot, 1999). Recent studies have indicated that the efficacy of beetle predators is directly related to the relative size of beetle and prey (Finch, 1996), which may aid in the selection of potential control agents. As studies by Finch & Elliott, (1999) make clear, beetle predators are much more effective when the life stages of the pest are directly accessible on the soil surface, and even thin layers of soil covering the prey items can prevent the successful suppression of prey populations. Of course, selection of appropriate generalist predators for biological control is predicated upon knowing what they consume and in what proportion. Prey-specific monoclonal antibodies appear to have considerable potential as indicators of diet breadth in generalists such as carabids (Harwood et al. 1999; Symondson & Glen, 1999). Once again, however, we are limited by a basic lack of knowledge of both pest and predator ecology. Chemical control of root-feeding insects has been the most common intervention strategy. However, there are concerns with the safety of commonly used products such as Chlorpyrifos (Dursban), which provides only a few weeks of control in its standard formulation. The extended release formulation of Chlorpyrifos (suScon Green) lasts longer in the environment, but is more expensive and less likely to come into contact with individual root pests. Both formulations can kill natural enemies and other soil fauna. Given that Bt-transgenic corn can release biologically active Bt into the rhizosphere in root exudates (Saxena et al. 1999), there exists the potential to develop transgenic crops modified specifically to defend themselves against root-feeding insects. Of course, the continuing controversy surrounding the development and use of genetically modified crops (Hunter, 2000b) may limit the exploitation of transgenic plants for use against root-feeding insects. Such crops would, however, solve the problem of access by ensuring contact between pest populations and the mechanism of control. Cultural control methods also have potential to reduce economic losses imposed by below-ground insect herbivores (Potter et al. 1996). For example, seasonal draining of rice fields can reduce oviposition by rice water weevil (Hesler et al. 1992). Likewise, traditional plant breeding programmes may be able to select for crops that are either tolerant or resistant to damage by root-feeding insects. In one of the few studies to address the issue, Houle & Simard 1996) found that compensatory responses (tolerance) of willow plants to simulated root herbivory did not vary among willow genotypes. The apparent lack of genetic variation in tolerance to root herbivory requires further investigation, given that genetic variation for resistance has been observed in several other systems (Powell et al. 1983; Byers et al. 1996; Strong et al. 1996). Indeed, the entire issue of genetically based resistance and tolerance to below-ground herbivores requires much more exploration in combination with mechanistic studies of root defence. One of the most striking gaps in our understanding of below-ground herbivory is the degree to which below-ground structures (roots, rhizomes, etc.) gain protection from herbivory through chemical defence. There is little doubt that some below-ground plant organs contain high concentrations of toxins (e.g. the potent alkaloids in the rhizomes of bloodroot, Sanguinaria canadensis). However, the standard bioassays and measurements of insect performance, so prevalent in studies of above-ground insect herbivory, are generally lacking in below-ground systems. For example, although the presence of phenylpropanoid-derived metabolites in some plant roots is well established (Graham, 1991), their effects on insect herbivores have received little attention. Likewise, fine roots of forest trees often contain astringent phenolics and their concentrations generally increase as soil fertility declines (Muller et al. 1989). However, the degree to which astringent phenolics deter root-feeding insects is presently unclear. Studies of defence induction in roots are also in their infancy. Although both synthesis and concentrations of some plant defences are known to be high in roots (Baldwin, 1989; Tallamy & McCloud, 1991), comparatively little work has examined the effects of induced defences in roots on root-feeding insects. The few studies to date suggest that, as in above-ground tissues, defence induction in roots may be a common phenomenon. Grape (Vitis vinifera) roots can respond to attack by Phylloxera vastatrix aphids by producing a local necrotic zone around each aphid that isolates attackers from healthy tissue (Karban & Baldwin, 1997). Roots of wild parsnip, Pastinaca sativa, respond to damage by increases in their concentrations of furanocoumarins (Zangerl & Rutledge, 1996). In a compelling example, damage to spinach roots induces phytoecdysteroids (analogues of insect moulting hormones), whereas infection by fungal pathogens does not (Schmelz et al. 1998, 1999). Given that foliar concentrations of phytoecdysteroids are unaffected by root damage, this provides evidence of an evolved defence in spinach roots directed at below-ground insect herbivores. However, the effects of insect herbivores on the induction of defences in roots may be complex. For example, damage by turnip root fly, Delia floralis, causes a linear increase in only one of 14 glucosinolates in swede roots. An apparent balance between increases in aromatic glucosinolates and decreases in aliphatic glucosinolates results in overall glucosinolate concentration being unaffected by root damage (Hopkins et al. 1998). There are, of course, methodological difficulties associated with assessing putative chemical defences and their effects on insect herbivores below ground. In vitro root culture techniques may prove useful in future studies of root defence against herbivores (Wu et al. 1999). It would be naïve to expect that interactions between root-feeding insects and their host plants occur in isolation from other species in the community or are unaffected by interactions with the abiotic environment. Below-ground insect herbivores are members of complex food webs and participate in both community-level and ecosystem-level processes. Consequently, both biotic and abiotic forces interact with below-ground herbivory to dictate plant performance (Godfrey & Yeargan, 1985). For example, the effects of root-feeding on Vicia establishment vary with both soil fertility and levels of mycorrhizal infection (Ganade & Brown, 1997). Likewise, compensation by Centaurea maculosa for weevil herbivory on its roots is greatly compromised by nutrient deficiency (Steinger & Müller-Schärer (1992). In a fascinating multi-trophic interaction, fungal endophytes (Acremonium spp.) associated with fescue grasses increase the susceptibility of root-feeding Japanese beetle larvae to the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (Grewal et al. 1995). Competition among plants can overwhelm the effect of root herbivory in some systems (Müller-Schärer, 1991), but not in others (Noetzold et al. 1997). It seems likely then that interactions among root feeding and other ecological factors will prove to be complex and context-dependent in many systems. Studies by Val Brown and colleagues have been instrumental in highlighting the effects of below-ground herbivores on plant diversity. At the community level, insect herbivory below ground can reduce plant species richness and alter patterns of succession in European old fields (Brown & Gange, 1989). Specifically, root-feeding insects can accelerate succession by reducing forb persistence and colonization (Brown & Gange, 1992) with the application of soil insecticide increasing plant species richness, vegetative cover and plant size (Masters & Brown, 1997). In short-grass prairie, even infrequent outbreaks of insect herbivores below ground can have long-term effects on plant community dynamics and recovery from disturbance (Coffin et al. 1998). Of course, the effects of below-ground herbivory on plant biomass and species diversity can vary both seasonally and with the plant species under investigation (Wardle & Barker, 1997). At the ecosystem level, low levels of below-ground herbivory can increase nitrogen flux from plants to soil, increase soil microbial activity, and increase the rates of nitrogen recycling in grassland ecosystems (Bardgett et al. 1999). In tallgrass prairie, the emergence of annual cicadas can represent a significant flux of non-gaseous nitrogen from below-to above-ground (Callaham et al. 2000). Mycorrhizae, as a result of their intimate associations with root systems, may influence feeding by below-ground herbivores by changing the quality or the quantity of root resources (Gange, 1999). If studies of root–insect herbivore interactions are relatively rare, those that consider mycorrhizae are positively endangered! The data that do exist suggest that colonization of plant roots by arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) has a negative impact on root-feeding insects. For example, Gange et al. (1994) demonstrated that the survival and biomass of black pine weevil larvae feeding on the roots of Taraxacum officinale were halved by the presence of the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae. When Gange (1996) repeated the experiment using strawberry as a host-plant, root colonization by a single species of AM again reduced the performance of weevil larvae. However, when roots were colonized by two AM species simultaneously, the negative effects on the root-feeding insect disappeared. Extrapolating from a single study is dangerous, but it suggests that any resistance factor(s) conferred on roots by their association with mycorrhizae may be compromised if multiple infection takes place. Given that mycorrhizal colonization generally increases the biomass of roots (Smith & Read, 1997), their putative effects upon root resistance to herbivores is more likely to be mediated by changes in root quality than root quantity (Gange, 1999). As studies of below-ground herbivory become more common, complex interactions among community members both above- and below-ground are likely to emerge. For example, foliage removal by a leaf-chewing insects can result in reduced mycorrhizal colonization of plant roots (Gehring & Whitham, 1991; Gange & Bower, 1997). Given that mycorrhizal colonization can confer resistance to root feeders (Gange et al. 1994; Gange, 1996), above-ground defoliation has the potential to increase the susceptibility of roots to their herbivores. However, most studies seem to suggest that the opposite is true; stem- and leaf-feeding insects appear to reduce the performance of root-feeding insects. For example, Moran & Whitham, (1990) demonstrated that leaf galling by aphids on Chenopodium can lead to a large reduction in the populations of root-feeding aphids. Conversely, below-ground damage by insect herbivores is generally thought to increase the quality of plant tissues for above-ground herbivores (Gange & Brown, 1989; Masters et al. 1993). These complex interactions between below- and above-ground herbivores are potentially very important. When we observe high densities of insect herbivores feeding upon the leaves and shoots of our agricultural and timber crops, we rarely consider the possibility that the severity of their depredations may result, in part, from high densities of root-feeding insects. Likewise, yield increases following the successful control of above-ground insect pests may be compromised by subsequent increases in the densities of root-feeding herbivores. It may be early to speak of generalities when so few data are available, but the current consensus appears to be that the patterns described by Moran & Whitham, (1990) and Gange & Brown, (1989) may be common; above-ground herbivory has a negative effect on root-feeders, whereas below-ground herbivory has a positive effect on foliar feeders (Masters et al. 1993; Masters, 1999). The evidence for such contramensal interactions (Arthur & Mitchell, 1989) comes from both laboratory and field studies. For example, root-feeding aphid populations on Cardamine are significantly reduced in the presence of shoot-feeding aphids (Salt et al. 1996). Similarly, the growth rates of chafer larvae feeding upon the roots of Sonchus oleraceus are reduced when leaves are concurrently mined by Agromyzid larvae (Masters & Brown, 1992). By contrast, the pupal weights of leaf miners are higher in the presence of chafers. Other guilds of above-ground herbivores (leaf-chewers, phloem-feeders) also respond positively to chafer damage in this system (Masters, 1999) while simultaneously depressing chafer growth rates. Field experiments employing soil insecticides (Masters, 1995b; Masters & Brown, 1997) and artificial root damage (Foggo & Speight, 1993; Foggo et al. 1994) support the view that below-ground herbivores facilitate population growth of insect herbivores above ground. Interactions between above- and below-ground herbivores appear to be mediated primarily by increases in soluble nitrogen and sugar contents in above-ground tissues (root-feeders increase foliage quality) and decreases in root biomass below-ground (aerial herbivores depress root growth) (Holland & Detling, 1990; Masters, 1995a). More detailed investigations of mechanism are, however, desperately needed in such systems, including the potential induction or suppression of defences (Seastedt et al. 1988; Karban & Baldwin, 1997) and the signalling pathways responsible for both defensive and 'civilian' plant responses to damage (Hunter, 2000a). Such investigations may help to explain why some studies do not conform to established patterns. For example, above-ground grazing by vertebrates can increase the densities of root-feeding insects (Roberts & Morton, 1985; Seastedt et al. 1988), and artificial defoliation of bunchgrass, Muhlenbergia quadridentata, has no effect on root-feeding Phyllophaga larvae in Mexico (Morón-Ríos et al. 1997). Given the importance of damage-specific signal cascades to the defensive response of plants (Hunter, 2000a), we should not be surprised that vertebrate grazing, artificial damage and foliar-feeding insects generate different responses by plants and their below-ground herbivores. In terms of relative biomass and productivity, below-ground plant parts represent a substantial fraction of the resources available to terrestrial herbivores. In terms of relative effort by insect ecologists, root-feeding insects have been greatly understudied. There are several areas of endeavour that would appear to require considerable work. First, we need detailed mechanistic studies of root defences. How variable are the physical and chemical defences of roots? Do they have a significant impact upon the populations of root-feeding insects? What signalling pathways are expressed during the induction of root defences and how are they affected by environmental variables? Second, we need to explore genetic variation in the tolerance and resistance of plant roots to their insect herbivores. An understanding of that genetic variation, and the role of the environment in its expression, will allow us to better comprehend the evolution of root defences and the potential to select for resistant and tolerant crop varieties. Third, we should explore the potential of genetically modified crops with tissue-specific root defences against root-feeding insects. Problems of applying control measures below ground may make transgenic plants a suitable option for reducing the depredations of below-ground crop pests. Of course, a detailed understanding of rhizosphere ecology and impacts on non-target organisms will also be required. Fourth, increased exploitation of entomopathogenic nematodes as control agents of root-feeding insects should be explored. They appear to have dramatic impacts in both natural and managed systems and are of great potential benefit to biological control programmes. Finally, studies of root herbivore–mycorrhizal interactions are considerably improving our understanding of soil ecology and their number should be greatly increased. Insect ecologists are not generally reluctant to get their hands dirty, and the paucity of studies of below-ground herbivores may reflect methodological difficulties rather than lack of interest. It might be time for the funding agencies to develop financial incentives to encourage researchers to solve methodological limitations and to redress the imbalance that currently favours research on insects above ground. In any case, we have clearly had our heads in the sand on the issue of root-feeding insects. Unfortunately, most of us appear to have had our eyes shut at the time. I would like to thank the US Department of Agriculture (Grant 00-35101-9283) for supporting our work on root herbivores.

TITLE: Metabolic phenotype mediates the outcome of competitive interactions in a response‐surface field experiment
ABSTRACT: Abstract Competition and metabolism should be linked. Intraspecific variation in metabolic rates and, hence, resource demands covary with competitive ability. The effects of metabolism on conspecific interactions, however, have mostly been studied under laboratory conditions. We used a trait‐specific response‐surface design to test for the effects of metabolism on pairwise interactions of the marine colonial invertebrate, Bugula neritina in the field. Specifically, we compared the performance (survival, growth, and reproduction) of focal individuals, both in the presence and absence of a neighbor colony, both of which had their metabolic phenotype characterized. Survival of focal colonies depended on the metabolic phenotype of the neighboring individual, and on the combination of both the focal and neighbor colony metabolic phenotypes that were present. Surprisingly, we found pervasive effects of neighbor metabolic phenotypes on focal colony growth and reproduction, although the sign and strength of these effects showed strong microenvironmental variability. Overall, we find that the metabolic phenotype changes the strength of competitive interactions, but these effects are highly contingent on local conditions. We suggest future studies explore how variation in metabolic rate affects organisms beyond the focal organism alone, particularly under field conditions.

TITLE: Indirect interactions in the microbial world: specificities and similarities to plant–insect systems
ABSTRACT: Abstract Trophic interactions between bacteria, viruses, and protozoan predators play crucial roles in structuring aquatic microbial communities and regulating microbe‐mediated ecosystem functions (biogeochemical processes). In this microbial food web, protozoan predators and viruses share bacteria as a common resource, and protozoan predators can kill viruses [intraguild predation (IGP)] and vice versa, even though these latter processes are probably of less importance. However, protozoan predators (IG predator) and viruses (IG prey) generally occur together in various environments, and this cannot be fully explained by the classic IGP models. In addition, controlled experiments have often demonstrated that protozoan predators have apparently positive effects on viral activity. These surprising patterns can be explained by indirect interactions between them via induced trait changes in bacterial assemblages, which can be compared with trait‐mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) in terrestrial plant–insect systems. Here, we review some trait changes in bacterial assemblages that may positively affect the activities and abundance of viruses. It has been suggested that in bacterial assemblages, protozoan predation may enhance growth conditions for individual bacteria and induce both phenotypic trait changes at the individual (e.g., filament‐forming bacteria) and group level as a result of changes in bacterial community composition (e.g., species dominance). We discuss the specificities of aquatic microbial systems and attempt find functional similarities between aquatic microbial systems and terrestrial plant–insect systems with regard to TMII function.

TITLE: Reconstitution in Vitro of the V1 Complex from the Yeast Vacuolar Proton-translocating ATPase
ABSTRACT: Oligomeric assembly is a fundamental aspect of many complex enzymes. Using our native gel technique for examining subcomplexes of the V-ATPase V1 sector, we have developed an in vitro reconstitution assay for assembly of this complex. Assembly of complex II, the soluble V1complex observed in native gels, is dependent upon the presence of divalent cations and physiological temperatures. Assembly of soluble V1 can occur in a stepwise fashion from smaller subcomplexes found in some strains deleted for V-ATPase subunits. Specifically, V1 can be assembled directly from complex III (subunits E and G) with complex IV (subunits A, B, D, and F) without prior disassembly of complex IV. The formation of complex III in vivo is also shown to be essential and could not be achievedin vitro. Assembly from simpler precursors is possible and is enhanced by added ATP. Assembly can be blocked byN-ethylmaleimide in a Vma1p (subunit A)-specific manner. From these data, we extend our previous model to consider an assembly pathway whose steps reflect the catalytic mechanism of the Boyer binding-change model.

Many enzymes are oligomeric and require the coordinated assembly of numerous individual subunits. The vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) 1The abbreviations used are: V-ATPase, vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; HA, hemagglutinin; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; ORF, open reading frame; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate. is such a multisubunit enzyme, comprised of over a dozen different proteins both in and on the membranes of vacuoles, lysosomes, tonoplasts, and related compartments (1Harvey W.R. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 1-485PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme is also found at plasma membranes in certain species and tissues. More complex than its evolutionary cousin, the F-type ATP synthase, the V-ATPase is composed of over 22 individual protein subunits that are the product of at least 12 unique genes, some of which have multiple isoforms in higher eukaryotes. Because interactions between these subunits are fundamental to both the assembly and the energy-transducing mechanism of this enzyme, we imagine that the pathway of assembly might be related to the mechanism of the enzyme. We have utilized native PAGE to reveal a myriad of partial V-ATPase complexes (Table I) found at steady state in the cytoplasm of both wild-type yeast as well as in deletion mutants of specific ATPase subunits encoded by the VMA andVPH gene families (2Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10397-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 2J. J. Tomashek, L. A. Graham, M. U. Hutchins, T. H. Stevens, and D. J. Klionsky, manuscript in preparation. In wild-type yeast, as well as strains lacking one or more integral membrane sector subunits (e.g. vma3Δ andvph1Δstv1Δ), we observe a large stable complex (II; 576 ± 96 kDa) that we believe is the soluble cytoplasmic form of V1. This complex contains at least Vma1p (A subunit), Vma2p (B subunit), Vma4p (E subunit), Vma7p (F subunit), Vma8p (D subunit), and Vma10p (G subunit), with a probable stoichiometry of A3B3DEFG. This complex is also present invma5Δ (Vma5p is the peripheral subunit C), indicating Vma5p is not necessary for assembly of the V1. In all strains except vma4Δ and vma10Δ, we observe a small complex (III; 96 ± 28 kDa) consisting of, minimally, Vma4p and Vma10p. In vma4Δ and vma10Δ, we observe an intermediate complex (IV; 317 ± 49 kDa) that contains all of the above proteins except for Vma4p and Vma10p, and invma7Δ, we observe a complex (I) of low stability that runs above complex II and is of indeterminate mass. Again, it appears to contain all of the examined subunits, except for Vma7p. Finally, in all strains except vma7Δ and vma8Δ, we observe complex VI that contains Vma7p and Vma8p.Table ISubcomplexes of the V-ATPase detected by native gel electrophoresisSubcomplexMass in kDaContains at leastFound inIND1-aND, not determined.1p, 2p, 4p, 8p, 10pvma7ΔII576 ± 961p, 2p, 4p, 7p, 8p, 10pWild type, vma3Δ, vma5Δ, vph1Δstv1ΔIII96 ± 284p, 10pAll but vma4Δ andvma10ΔIV317 ± 491p, 2p, 7p, 8pvma4Δ, vma10ΔVIND7p, 8pAll butvma7Δ and vma8Δ1-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab From these observations, we have formulated speculative models for the assembly of the V1 complex. However, these models are limited by assumptions regarding the intermediate nature of the observed complexes. We have not known if the observed complexes were intermediates trapped along a bona fide assembly pathway, or if they were products of artifactual sidetracks that resulted from the deletion of a specific subunit. In the present study, we have extended our analysis of the intermediate complexes. We demonstrate that these complexes are able to assemblein vitro to form the soluble V1 sector observed as complex II, thus indicating that they are not terminal complexes. We show that an early assembly step is ATP-dependent and that this is associated with the catalytic site of the enzyme. Finally, we show specific assembly of complex II onto isolated vacuolar membranes containing the V0 sector, indicating that complex II is capable of V0-dependent membrane association. Kinetic studies of these processes have begun to distinguish discrete steps along the assembly pathway. These results lead us to conclude that the assembly pathway of the enzyme may recapitulate the functional mechanism. All reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. HEPES buffer was from Research Organics, Inc. Media components were from Difco. All single deletion strains were based on the wild-type W303–1B (MATα leu2 his3 ade2 trp1 ura3) and were gifts from N. Nelson (Tel Aviv University). Double deletions were constructed as follows. Strainvma4Δvma7Δ was constructed starting from thevma7Δ strain (vma7::URA3) and performing a subsequent knockout of vma4::LEU2using a construct previously described (3Morano K.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2813-2824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strainvma8Δvma7Δ was constructed starting from thevma8Δ strain (vma8::URA3) and performing a subsequent knockout of vma7::LEU2using the construct in pLG13 (4Graham L.A. Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25974-25977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Knockouts were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and native PAGE analyses. Antisera have been previously described (2Tomashek J.J.

The VMA7 and VMA7HA expression plasmids were constructed as follows. Primers to VMA7, which isolated the ORF and attached a 5′-BamHI and a 3′-XhoI site, were designed and used to isolate the VMA7 ORF from YPN1VMA7 (5Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24150-24155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the VMA7HA ORF from pLG20 (4Graham L.A. Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25974-25977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction amplification. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with BamHI/XhoI and cloned into theBamHI/SalI sites of pHADR. This plasmid was constructed by excising the multiple cloning site of pRS423 (containing a HIS3 marker) and replacing it with a singleSphI site to form pRS423S. The ADH/GAL4 fusion expression cassette from pA′ (2Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10397-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was modified by deleting the GAL4 fusion portion located between two HindIII sites and replacing it with a multiple cloning site. The modified ADH expression cassette was moved into the SphI site of pRS423S to form pHADR. Both pHADR7 and pHADR7HA complemented the vma phenotype when transformed into the vma7Δ strain (data not shown). Preparation of cytosolic extracts and native gel electrophoresis have been described previously (2Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10397-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Extracts were kept on ice except during reconstitution as described in the figure legends and text. Incubations were for 10–60 min, as indicated. The following were used at these final concentrations, where indicated: metal cations (5 mm), ATP (1 mm), EDTA (10 mm), NEM (1 mm). Reconstitutions were always returned to ice before loading onto 6% native gels. Immunoblots were quantitated with Millipore BioImage software. Cells were harvested at midlog phase, washed with water, and incubated in 20 ml of 10 mm Tris-SO4, pH 9.4, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol for 20 min. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in spheroplasting buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2% glucose, 1 m sorbitol) and incubated with Zymolyase (ICN) for 30 min. Spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in 15 ml of Buffer A (10 mm MES/Tris, pH 6.9, 0.1 mmMgCl2, 12% Ficoll 400) containing 20 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (5 mg/ml each pepstatin A,l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, leupeptin, α2-macroglobulin, and 200 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were lysed at 4 °C by Dounce homogenization. The lysate was divided into ultracentrifuge tubes, overlaid with 4 ml of Buffer B (as Buffer A, but 8% Ficoll 400), and spun at 30,000 rpm for 30 min. Vacuolar membranes were collected off the top, homogenized in Buffer C (10 mmMES/Tris, pH 6.9, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA) and spun at 30,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet containing vacuole membranes was resuspended in native gel sample buffer and stored at −80 °C until needed. For membrane association experiments, thawed membranes were combined with vma3Δ cytosolic extract and incubated in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2 for 25 min at 30 °C. The membranes were pelleted at high speed in a microcentrifuge for 1.5 min, and the supernatant fraction was moved to a separate tube. Some supernatant/pellet pairs were brought up in Laemmli buffer and examined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Strains bearing disruptions in single VMAgenes assemble subcomplexes of the peripheral V1 sector. To demonstrate that the intermediate subcomplexes previously characterized were on the assembly pathway, we developed an in vitroreconstitution protocol. Preliminary experiments consisted of mixing extracts from vma4Δ and vma8Δ. These extracts were chosen because the former accumulates complex IV and the latter accumulates complex III, complexes which contain mutually exclusive subunits. Mixing crude extracts containing these complexes resulted in formation of complex II in a divalent cation-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A). We examined the effect of different anions and cations on complex II formation and observed that Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+ were all effective, whereas Zn2+ was ineffective (Fig.1 B). In fact, ZnCl2 caused the complete loss of complexes III and IV when combined with extracts containing these complexes (data not shown). Both MgCl2 and MgOAc2 were effective, suggesting that no specific anion is necessary for assembly. Occasionally, we observed weak assembly with NaCl, but the signal from complex II was faint and inconsistent. Because there is 1 mm EDTA in our extract buffer, we suspect that 5 mm Na+ may compete weakly and release enough endogenous divalent cations to effect some limited reconstitution. To show that the ATPase-specific subcomplexes were responsible for the appearance of complex II, we did a titration ofvma4Δ extract versus vma8Δ extract (Fig.2). The formation of complex II clearly depends upon both extracts, with maximal reconstitution occurring when the extracts are at near equal proportions. Likewise, complex III and IV both disappear as they become limiting. It is interesting to note that complex VI (Vma7p, Vma8p) does not decrease significantly until complex IV (Vma1p, Vma2p, Vma7p, Vma8p) has first been consumed, suggesting that complex IV is a more direct precursor to complex II than is complex VI. Under the conditions where complex III becomes limiting, we see the formation of a new complex, designated complex Q. This complex only appears in reconstitutions where vma4Δ is one of the partners and may be an intermediate complex between IV and II. It runs at a position nearly identical to complex III. This complex is only weakly and transiently detectable relative to the other complexes observed, making complete analysis of its composition difficult. Because the assembly was dependent on the presence of Mg2+, we surmised it would be possible to gather kinetic data by stopping the assembly with the further addition of EDTA. Reactions were prepared by mixing two extracts on ice and then started with the addition of MgCl2(5 mm final) and the transfer to either ice or a 30 °C waterbath. Aliquots were taken at given time points and transferred to iced tubes containing EDTA (10 mm final concentration). From quantitation of native gels (Fig. 3), it can be seen that the assembly of complex II is temperature-dependent and occurs with a half-time of <5 min at 30 °C. We wished to know if some amount of in vivo assembly or modification was required for in vitro assembly to occur. To test this, we attempted reconstitutions with all possible combinations of extracts, and the results are summarized in Table II. All combinations were able to support formation of complex II, except for vma4Δ × vma10Δ and occasionallyvma1Δ × vma2Δ (see below). Kinetics of assembly in all positive combinations were similar to thevma4Δ × vma8Δ cross, with half-times of ∼5 min (data not shown). The vma4Δ × vma10Δcombination, which completely lacks complex III ab initio, does not support formation of complex II under any conditions tested. However, we have observed that the steady-state levels of Vma4p are extremely low in vma10Δ cells and that Vma4p is rapidly degraded in this strain.2 Thus, levels of Vma4p may be the limiting factor. However, assembly of this complex may depend upon conditions found only in the intact cell.Table IIComplex II assembly in different extract combinationsSecond extractFirst extractvma1Δvma2Δvma4Δvma7Δvma8Δvma10Δvma1Δ−±++++vma2Δ−++++vma4Δ−++−vma7Δ−++vma8Δ−+vma10Δ− Open table in a new tab Because we observed reassembly in most cases, even those where there were no pre-existing large complexes in either of the starting extracts, it remained an open question whether or not complex II assembles directly from subcomplexes or from individual subunits that became available as the subcomplexes dissociate. In particular, we decided to examine if complex IV is competent for further assembly without dissociation. To examine this, we employed the epitope-tagged Vma7p (4Graham L.A. Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25974-25977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to label complex IV as shown in the scheme in Fig. 4 A. By creating tagged and untagged complex IV and then complementing itin vitro with vma8Δ extract containing untagged or tagged Vma7p, respectively, we could determine if complex IV was dissassembled because its Vma7p would mix with that in the total reaction. The presence of the tagged Vma7p causes a slight shift in the position of complex IV (Fig. 4 B, right panel, lane 1 versus lane 2) and the position of complex II (Fig. 4 B,right panel, lanes 5 and 8 versus lanes 6 and7). There is also the appearance of an additional signal below complex VI. The tagged Vma7p is found in complex II only when it begins in complex IV (Fig. 4 B, right panel versus left panel, lanes 5 and 8). Tagged Vma7p is excluded from complex II when complex IV in the reaction contains only untagged Vma7p (Fig. 4 B, right panel versus left panel, lanes 6 and 7). Levels of tagged Vma7p were comparable in the extracts from the strains in which this construct was expressed (Fig. 4 C). These results indicate that complex IV is a bonafide intermediate on the pathway to formation of complex II and that dissociation of complex IV does not occur to any appreciable extent prior to complex II assembly. We also note a similar result for complex VI; free Vma7pHA does not replace Vma7p that is present in a complex with Vma8p (Fig. 4 B, lane 6). To demonstrate that complex II was not a dead-end product itself, we undertook experiments to show it could assemble on isolated vacuolar membranes containing V0. We prepared membranes from vma2Δ, which have been shown to contain V0 without peripheral subunits (6Parra K.J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19592-19598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We also prepared vacuolar membranes from vma3Δ, which do not contain V0, as a control. Cytosolic extract fromvma3Δ, which contains large quantities of complex II, was combined with these membranes both in the presence (Fig.5) and absence (data not shown) of MgCl2. We observed that MgCl2 was necessary for association with the membrane. After a 25-min incubation at 30 °C, membranes were pelleted and examined by immunoblot for the presence of V1subunits. Association with the membrane is dependent upon both cytosol containing complex II and membranes containing V0. The membranes fromvma2Δ show the presence of representative V1subunits found in complex II. Membrane binding is specific as evidenced by the absence of complex II subunits from the vma3Δmembranes. The membranes from vma2Δ also bring down Vma13p, a protein that has been shown to be necessary for activity but not assembly of the V-ATPase (7Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of native gels with antibodies to Vma13p gave equivocal results (data not shown); it may be a component of complex II, but it does not appear to be associated with any other complex. Interestingly, Vma5p is not associated with the membrane, which may explain our inability to detect activity from these membranes (data not shown). The V-ATPase has been observed to assemble without this subunit in other systems although its presence does enhance the level of activity (8Puopolo K. Sczekan M. Magner R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5171-5176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the yeast vma5Δstrain, no V-ATPase activity is detected, and the V1subunits are found assembled but not attached to the membrane (2Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.M. Klionsky D.J. J.

Vma5p may be involved in a transient interaction, necessary for attachment and full activity but not necessary for maintenance of a stable V1V0 association. Our data suggest that complex II is capable of assembly onto the V0 sector of the V-ATPase. Under our standard conditions for reconstitution, we found weak assembly of complex II from thevma1Δ × vma2Δ combination. Upon further examination, it was found that assembly of complex II fromvma1Δ × vma2Δ could be enhanced by the addition of 1 mm ATP. Measurement of assembly kinetics with MgATP, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+ reveal both a lag and lower overall assembly without added ATP (Fig.6). Because the extracts have not been depleted for triphosphonucleotides, there may be residual ATP available to support limited reconstitution in the absence of added ATP. Attempts to deplete the extracts with apyrase and hexokinase did abolish assembly (data not shown), although subsequent add-back of ATP was impossible due to the presence of the scavenger. ATP analogues such as ATPγS and AMP-PNP showed no significant effect by themselves and did not show any competition at concentrations from 0.1 to 10 times the ATP concentration (data not shown). Interestingly, the divalent cation dependence for vma1Δ × vma2Δ is ion-specific and parallels reported preferences of divalent cations for ATPase activity (10Kakinuma Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10859-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tognoli L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 146: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 12Wang Z.-Q. Gluck S. J. Biol.

To determine if ATP binding at the catalytic site was important to formation of complex II, we examined the ability of N-ethyl maleimide to inhibit assembly. NEM reacts specifically and irreversibly with a cysteine residue in the active site on Vma1p (14Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recombination reaction of vma1Δ × vma2Δ, which was first treated with NEM followed by ATP showed no reconstitution, whereas if first treated with ATP, weak reconsititution was observed (Fig. 7 A). More significantly, if the deletion extracts were treated separately, pretreatment ofvma2Δ (containing Vma1p) with NEM abolishes reconstitution while pretreatment of vma1Δ (containing Vma2p) with NEM is still capable of assembly (Fig. 7 B). This strongly suggests that binding of ATP at a functional catalytic site is necessary for assembly of the V1 complex since the cytosolic constituents of these two extracts should be identical except for the specific Vma proteins. As our revised model makes clear, this can be elegantly coordinated with the favored mechanistic model, the Boyer binding-change mechanism. Biosynthesis and assembly of multimeric proteins into their quaternary structures must be regulated by both kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. The stability of complex II suggests that it is a thermodynamic trap, making it the dominant complex in wild-type cells and also allowing us to form it in vitro. We do not see complex IV form in vitro, even under conditions where we assume it must be a transient intermediate (e.g. thevma1Δ × vma2Δ reaction) because its equilibrium favors dissociation into smaller complexes or individual subunits unless it can further assemble to complex II. Attempts to form complex IV in vitro (vma4Δvma7Δ ×vma4Δvma8Δ) were unsuccessful (data not shown). Once formed, the attachment and detachment of complex II to the membrane sector would then have an equilibrium independent of the levels of individual subunits. Assembly and disassembly of the V1V0 has been proposed as a mechanism of regulation (15Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is supported by the hyperassembly of V1onto V0 in cells with point mutations in V0sector subunits that abolish function but not assembly (16Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This equilibrium would be regulated by other subunits, e.g.Vma5p, which is not necessary for assembly of V1 but is required for assembly on the membrane in vivo and is involved in glucose deprivation-mediated modification of the V1 following detachment from the membrane sector. 3J. Tomashek, unpublished data. Interestingly, cytosolic V1 complexes, which apparently do not exchange with membrane-bound complexes, have been observed in tissue culture cells (17Myers M. Forgac M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). What the role of such complexes might be and whether they exist in yeast remain to be determined. In contrast, assembly steps from individual subunits to complex II depend on temperature, divalent cation, and nucleotide. At 30 °C, our kinetic data indicate that most combinations of deletion strains assemble with roughly equal half-times (∼5 min) although there is a tendency for extracts containing higher order complexes to show faster assembly (compare Fig. 3 with Fig. 6). At lower temperatures, measurable differences in assembly rates may appear and reveal key steps where kinetic control assumes a larger role. We have expanded our previous assembly models to consider these data (Fig. 8). In addition to our data which support the model, we favor it because of its similarity to the Boyer binding-change model of F-type ATP synthase catalysis (18Boyer P.D. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2164-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), a mechanism which has been proposed for the V-type enzymes as well (19Kasho V.N. Boyer P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8708-8711Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The Boyer model proposes three sites, catalytically equivalent over time but instantaneously nonequivalent. We hypothesize that these three possible states (MgATP bound (T), MgADP/Pi bound (D), and open (O)) are not energetically equivalent. Thus, if assembly begins with the association of Vma1p and Vma2p to form the catalytic site (found predominantly on Vma1p but shared by both), one of these three states may be preferred, and an accumulation of dimers in one state would result. The suggestion that these two subunits associate to form a catalytic site is supported by recent evidence that these two subunits have low but detectable ATPase activity higher than either individual subunit (20Xie X.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30980-30985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, our own two-hybrid data indicate that Vma1p and Vma2p can interact independent of other subunits. Here, we propose that this interaction nucleates around the catalytic site of the heterodimer and suggest that MgATP stabilizes this dimerization. Thus, Vma1p-T-Vma2p is the most favored of the three possible initial complexes. Association with another subunit or subcomplex, in our model complex VI, would convert Vma1p-T-Vma2p into a new state stabilized by both hydrolysis of the nucleotide and incorporation of the new subunits into the growing complex. We prefer a model where association of the two subcomplexes (Vma1p-T-Vma2p and VI) would precede hydrolysis of ATP. In our model, complex VI acts as a nucleotidase activating factor, similar to GTPase activating proteins. After the catalytic step, complex VI (associated now with Vma1p-D-Vma2p) is situated to bind another Vma1p-T-Vma2p dimer from the cytosolic pool. The result is the formation of complex IV, which now has two catalytic sites each in a different energetic state defined by their nucleotide contents and interactions with complex VI. Complex III (Vma4p-Vma10p) may now interact with the Vma1p-D-Vma2p portion of complex IV, and stimulate release of the nucleotide and phosphate. In this sense, complex III is a nucleotide exchange factor. Release of ADP and Pi, in turn, allows hydrolysis to proceed at the second site, and thus the core subunits become positioned to receive the third Vma1p-T-Vma2p dimer. The final complex now has the three different sites in the correct energetic states necessary for catalysis to commence. The complete V1 might be regarded as three ATPases rotating around a complex of hydrolysis activating and nucleotide exchange factors. This model also accommodates an explanation for why ATP analogues have no apparent effect on assembly. The ATP-bound site is, based on the Boyer model, predicted to be of extremely high affinity. However, this may be true only for the ATP-bound site in the complete enzyme,i.e. of the last site added during assembly (incorporation of which makes the site “tight”). The Vma1p-T-Vma2p free dimer may have a low affinity and high exchange rate for nucleotide. Thus, in the absence of ATP, the analogues would not support assembly because they cannot be hydrolyzed. In the presence of ATP, the analogues would compete at high enough concentration but not block assembly, even if they were incorporated into the final “tight” site (although this would poison the enzyme). In our experiments, we are not able to eliminate completely endogenous ATP. NEM, which binds covalently and irreversibly, does block assembly. What about complexes I and V? Complex V, seen in significant steady-state amounts only from vma4Δ andvma10Δ extracts, disappears very rapidly at 30 °C or when combined with other extracts, and thus could not be followed in our assays. Complex I appears in the absence of Vma7p, a subunit which we have implicated in early assembly events. Because complex I is very unstable, we believe it may be an artifactual complex that assembles incorrectly, accepting Vma8p alone in lieu of complex VI. As a result, the catalytic dimers would all be in the Vma1p-T-Vma2p configuration, or possibly a combination of Vma1p-T-Vma2p and Vma1p-O-Vma2p, if complex III is able to release ATP from the second site incorporated. Because the energetic states in complex I would be discoordinated, disassembly of this complex may be necessary for subsequent correct assembly to occur. Therefore, complex I may be the dead end of an artifactual pathway that occurs only because of the absence of Vma7p. Our assembly system is different from previously described reconstitution systems from plants (21Ward J.M. Sze H. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 50: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), animals (20Xie X.-S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19592-19598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) in three significant ways. First, we do not rely on chemical treatment (e.g. nitrate, iodide, or urea) to break apart the V-ATPase, a treatment which may chemically modify the enzyme (23Dschida W.J.A. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1557-1563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Instead, we begin with subunits and partially assembled complexes in a physiological milieu. Second, we are working with crude extracts, whereas other reconstitution has been done with purified enzymes and heterologously expressed subunits. Thus, we cannot exclude the involvement of factors apart from the ATPase subunits themselves. Third, we have been as yet unable to recover activity, while other systems have obtained detectable yields of activity from dialyzed mixtures of subunits. However, we expect with further attenuation to be able to recover activity and identify the specific factors responsible. Reassembly in other systems is achieved in the absence of Mg2+ and ATP and at 4 °C, albeit after long incubation and dialysis. From the results in our system, we believe assembly of the V1 complex is an ordered process that recapitulates its proposed functional mechanism. We hope that further experiments will provide greater insight regarding the validity of this provocative ATPase assembly model.

TITLE: Can Functional Traits Explain Plant Coexistence? A Case Study with Tropical Lianas and Trees
ABSTRACT: Organisms are adapted to their environment through a suite of anatomical, morphological, and physiological traits. These functional traits are commonly thought to determine an organism’s tolerance to environmental conditions. However, the differences in functional traits among co-occurring species, and whether trait differences mediate competition and coexistence is still poorly understood. Here we review studies comparing functional traits in two co-occurring tropical woody plant guilds, lianas and trees, to understand whether competing plant guilds differ in functional traits and how these differences may help to explain tropical woody plant coexistence. We examined 36 separate studies that compared a total of 140 different functional traits of co-occurring lianas and trees. We conducted a meta-analysis for ten of these functional traits, those that were present in at least five studies. We found that the mean trait value between lianas and trees differed significantly in four of the ten functional traits. Lianas differed from trees mainly in functional traits related to a faster resource acquisition life history strategy. However, the lack of difference in the remaining six functional traits indicates that lianas are not restricted to the fast end of the plant life–history continuum. Differences in functional traits between lianas and trees suggest these plant guilds may coexist in tropical forests by specializing in different life–history strategies, but there is still a significant overlap in the life–history strategies between these two competing guilds.

TITLE: Mistletoe generates non‐trophic and trait‐mediated indirect interactions through a shared host of herbivore consumers
ABSTRACT: Indirect interactions emerge among a wide range of herbivores sharing the same plant resource. Consumers usually belong to different trophic guilds, from folivores and sapsuckers to parasitic plants. We propose that mistletoes parasitizing pines could play a key role acting as herbivores on host pines and coming indirectly into competition with other herbivores feeding on the same host. Changes caused by mistletoes on its host have been well studied, but its effects running across trophic webs remain unrevealed. In this study, we investigate the effect of European mistletoe (Viscum album subsp. austriacum) on the host‐feeding herbivores via trait‐mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) across their shared pine host (Pinus nigra subsp. salzmannii). We performed field and laboratory experiments, and analyzed the net effect of different mistletoe parasite loads on three host‐phytophagous species: the sapsucker Cinara pini (Aphididae), the winter folivore Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Thaumetopoeidae), and the summer folivore Brachyderes sp. (Curculionidae), all being members of different functional feeding groups (FFGs). We summarize the mistletoe–host–herbivore interactions by means of a TMII, where mistletoe parasitism causes non‐trophic links and detrimental indirect interactions on pine‐feeding herbivores across its shared host, suggesting a worsening of host quality as food. These indirect interactions vary according to three parameters. First, the intensity has a non‐proportional relation with parasite load, showing an impact threshold on highly parasitized pines. Second, the movement capacity of insect herbivores determines their response, by decreasing the abundance of herbivores with low movement ability (aphids and pine processionary caterpillars) while altering the behavior (plant selection) of more mobile herbivores (pine weevils). Finally, FFG determines the intensity of mistletoe parasitism effects, folivores being more responsive than sapsuckers. Overall, mistletoe generates non‐trophic interaction linkages in the forest able to modify community structure by becoming a nexus of the entire herbivore community of the pine canopy.

TITLE: Ecological release leads to novel ontogenetic diet shift in kokanee (<i>Oncorhynchus nerka</i>)
ABSTRACT: We investigate adaptive resource polymorphism in kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka) from Jo-Jo Lake, Alaska, by determining whether previously observed niche expansion occurs at the population or individual level. Utilizing morphological, genetic, and stable isotope techniques, we found no evidence of discrete trophic morphotypes as previously described, but instead found evidence for an ontogenetic diet shift. Carbon and nitrogen isotope data indicate a 40% decrease in the proportion of benthic feeding and an increase of one trophic position over the size and age ranges of adult kokanee, corresponding to a diet shift from consumption of macroinvertebrates in smaller individuals to piscivory in larger individuals. This novel piscivory in kokanee may result from predatory and competitive freedom resulting from the lack of limnetic predators in Jo-Jo Lake. Piscivorous feeding despite a phenotype–environment mismatch has resulted in large, piscivorous kokanee having up to 70% of their gill rakers damaged. Observed reductions in gill raker number relative to the putative ancestral population are convergent with expectations for piscivorous fishes, despite a presumed lack of standing genetic variation for piscivory in the sockeye salmon – kokanee species complex. Jo-Jo Lake kokanee are a distinctive example of adaptation in salmonids in response to ecological release. This unusual population highlights the importance of phenotypic plasticity in response to competition in shaping the adaptive landscape and altering evolutionary trajectories.

TITLE: An Ecological and Evolutionary Framework for Commensalism in Anthropogenic Environments
ABSTRACT: The definition of commensal taxa should be based on dependency. The concept of anthrodependent taxa leads to new species categorised as commensal. Commensals give insight into selective pressures in rapidly changing environments. Commensalism within anthropogenic environments has not been extensively discussed, despite its impact on humans, and there is no formal framework for assessing this ecological relationship in its varied forms. Here, we examine commensalism in anthropogenic environments in detail, considering both ecological and evolutionary drivers. The many assumptions about commensalism and the nature of anthropogenic environments are discussed and we highlight dependency as a key attribute of anthropogenic commensals (anthrodependent taxa). We primarily focus on mammalian species in the anthropogenic-commensal niche, but the traits described and selective pressures presented are likely fundamental to many species engaged in intense commensal relationships with humans. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this largely understudied interaction represents an important opportunity to investigate evolutionary processes in rapidly changing environments.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that this largely understudied interaction represents an important opportunity to investigate evolutionary processes in rapidly changing environments. Commensal taxa (see Glossary) have been major contributors to the human-mediated biodiversity crisis [1Stenseth N.C. et al.Mice, rats, and people: the bio-economics of agricultural rodent pests.Front. Ecol. Environ. 2003; 1: 367-375Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 2Martin L.J. et al.Evolution of the indoor biome.Trends Ecol. Evol. 2015; 30: 223-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar], are implicated in zoonoses [3Capizzi D. et al.Rating the rat: global patterns and research priorities in impacts and management of rodent pests.Mamm. Rev. 2014; 44: 148-162Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar], and were possible sources of domesticates [4Larson G. Fuller D.Q. The evolution of animal domestication.Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 2014; 45: 271-295Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 5Zeder M.A. Pathways to animal domestication.in: Gepts P. Biodiversity in Agriculture: Domestication, Evolution and Sustainability. Cambridge University Press, 2012: 227-259Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar]; thus, they have a profound impact on life on Earth. However, many aspects of this relationship, and the ecological and evolutionary processes associated with commensal taxa, are surprisingly poorly understood. This stems from the seemingly simple definition of commensalism: a relationship where one species benefits (+) and the other species experiences no impact (0) [6Johnson N.C. et al.Functioning of mycorrhizal associations along the mutualism-parasitism continuum.New Phytol. 1997; 135: 575-585Crossref Scopus (1356) Google Scholar]. Observations of animals benefitting from anthropogenic environments often lead to the conclusion that these animals are undergoing commensal-specific evolution. There are many assumptions associated with this evolutionary process, which we break down in this paper. We contend that anthropogenic environments are highly unstable and do not entirely buffer commensal species from seasonality. Therefore, the evolution of commensal taxa is defined by their ability to become dependent on these unstable anthropogenic environments. Observations of commensal interactions have led researchers in fields such as archaeology and studies of domestication to categorise species as commensally dependent, but without providing a wider ecological context. For example, because there is currently no adequate ecology-based framework for commensal evolution, the view that feral dog populations are reasonable models for 'proto-domestic' forms (e.g., [4Larson G. Fuller D.Q. The evolution of animal domestication.Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 2014; 45: 271-295Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 7Coppinger R. Coppinger L. A Startling New Understanding of Canine Origins, Behaviour and Evolution. Scribner, 2001Google Scholar]) has not been assessed with sufficient rigour. The assumption that domestic dogs derive ultimately from commensal wolves, therefore remains a premise underpinning much of the research into dog domestication (e.g., [8Axelsson E. et al.The genomic signature of dog domestication reveals adaptation to a starch-rich diet.Nature. 2013; 495: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar]). Although wolves do engage in commensal relationships with humans as facultative scavengers (e.g., [9Boitani L. Ciucci P. Comparative social ecology of feral dogs and wolves.Ethol. Ecol. Evol. 1995; 7: 49-72Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar]), whether it is possible for a subgroup of wolves, prior to direct human interaction, truly to become a commensal taxon in the evolutionary sense remains untested. A review of the current usage of the term 'commensalism' in anthropogenic environments highlights how dependence is central to the understanding of commensal taxa. Here, we identify the unpredictability and instability of the anthropogenic niche as the primary selective pressures involved in the evolution of commensal species. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an ecological framework is required to: (i) identify the intensity of the relationship in order to define a taxon as commensal; (ii) assess the complexities of ecological systems associated with commensals; and (iii) assess selective pressures on commensal taxa that drive their evolution. We propose a new term for organisms that might represent the typical commensal condition in an anthropogenic environment: 'anthrodependent taxa' or 'anthrodependants' (Box 1).Box 1Previously Used Definitions of Species in Anthropogenic Environments (with Our Proposed New Category*)Commensal taxa (com-: sharing and -mensa: table)Commensalism in its original and simplest form specifies a relationship, represented as +/0, whereby one organism benefits (+) from another without causing deleterious effects to the other (0) [6Johnson N.C. et al.Functioning of mycorrhizal associations along the mutualism-parasitism continuum.New Phytol. 1997; 135: 575-585Crossref Scopus (1356) Google Scholar].

Anthropophilic taxa (-phile: lover of) Traditionally applied to ectoparasites, this term has increasingly been used in archaeology to indicate species attracted to human environments and activities [4Larson G. Fuller D.Q. The evolution of animal domestication.Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 2014; 45: 271-295Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 88Cheke A. The timing of arrival of humans and their commensal animals on Western Indian Ocean oceanic islands.Phelsuma. 2010; 18: 38-69Google Scholar, 89Cucchi T. et al.First occurrence of the house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus Schwarz & Schwarz, 1943) in the Western Mediterranean: a zooarchaeological revision of subfossil occurrences.Biol. J. Linn. Soc. 2005; 84: 429-445Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar]. This can include not only commensal species, but also species opportunistically benefitting from humans, without dependence [90Vigne J.D. The origins of animal domestication and husbandry: a major change in the history of humanity and the biosphere.Comptes Rendus - Biol. 2011; 334: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar]. Domestic taxa (domus-: house) Humans actively buffer these taxa from external selective pressures, enhancing survival, and breeding. Therefore, humans reduce and sometimes remove impacts of natural evolutionary processes on these taxa and, at more advanced stages of domestication, humans directly control the selective pressures. *Anthrodependent taxa We propose this term to refer to those taxa that might have had, and continue to have, a commensal relationship (+/0), but are defined by their dependence on anthropogenic resources, which in some cases can have a negative impact on their once commensal partner. The term 'commensal', denoting a relationship, has a straightforward meaning [6Johnson N.C. et al.Functioning of mycorrhizal associations along the mutualism-parasitism continuum.New Phytol. 1997; 135: 575-585Crossref Scopus (1356) Google Scholar]. However, when the term is applied to a taxon (e.g., to rodents [10Aplin K.P. et al.Evolutionary biology of the genus Rattus: profile of an archetypal rodent pest.in: Singleton G.R. Rats, Mice and People: Rodent Biology Management. ACIAR, 2003: 487-498Google Scholar] or to a so-called 'proto-domestic' species [4Larson G. Fuller D.Q. The evolution of animal domestication.Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 2014; 45: 271-295Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar]), it often means something more complex, reflecting both the acquisition of a new capability to exploit the anthropogenic environment and an associated reliance upon it. Furthermore, as the relationship becomes more intense (one of dependence), these 'commensal taxa' rarely have a neutral impact on humans; for example, they consume crops, steal food, and/or harbour disease [3Capizzi D. et al.Rating the rat: global patterns and research priorities in impacts and management of rodent pests.Mamm. Rev. 2014; 44: 148-162Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 11Morand S. et al.Global parasite and Rattus rodent invasions: the consequences for rodent-borne diseases.Integr. Zool. 2013; 10: 409-423Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar] (Box 2).Box 2The Nature of a Relationship: 'Commensal Neutrality'Many so-called 'commensal' species have anything but a neutral relationship with humans [3Capizzi D. et al.Rating the rat: global patterns and research priorities in impacts and management of rodent pests.Mamm. Rev. 2014; 44: 148-162Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar]. Their role as disease vectors might be considered a key negative impact [11Morand S. et al.Global parasite and Rattus rodent invasions: the consequences for rodent-borne diseases.Integr. Zool. 2013; 10: 409-423Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar], but it is entirely indirect, given that essentially no energy is expended to spread the disease (although parasite-induced behaviours exist [91Webster J.P. Rats, cats, people and parasites: the impact of latent toxoplasmosis on behaviour.Microbes Infect. 2001; 3: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar]). Competition for resources is understood to be a–/–relationship [6Johnson N.C. et al.Functioning of mycorrhizal associations along the mutualism-parasitism continuum.New Phytol. 1997; 135: 575-585Crossref Scopus (1356) Google Scholar], with more obvious direct interaction. However, the comparison between the impact of disease and the damage from competition is difficult to quantify and might suggest that, when present, the indirect pathogen impact has a greater and more acute effect than the direct competition resulting from crop consumption [3Capizzi D. et al.Rating the rat: global patterns and research priorities in impacts and management of rodent pests.Mamm. Rev. 2014; 44: 148-162Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar]. Also, should we take into account the ability of humans to mitigate such impacts when considering whether a relationship is largely neutral or otherwise? Another question that is raised by the quantification of interactions is whether negative interactions are overriding and additive or whether they can be balanced by beneficial activities. Feral cats are a possible commensal species; they carry toxoplasmosis, a disease known to affect humans [91Webster J.P. Rats, cats, people and parasites: the impact of latent toxoplasmosis on behaviour.Microbes Infect. 2001; 3: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar], but they also consume and regulate populations of other species known to carry many more diseases [11Morand S. et al.Global parasite and Rattus rodent invasions: the consequences for rodent-borne diseases.Integr. Zool. 2013; 10: 409-423Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar]. Feral cats consume competitors of humans (rodents), so if disease is not considered, does that then make the relationship mutual? Does the perceived beneficial behaviour of feral cats mitigate the negative impact they can have on humans? Ultimately, this extremely complex set of impacts affects the evolution of all organisms involved but, on an evolutionary ecology scale, it is currently unquantifiable. As a result, it might be best to simply categorise these interactions as fluctuating and complex rather than trying to define them as negative or neutral. Many so-called 'commensal' species have anything but a neutral relationship with humans [3Capizzi D. et al.Rating the rat: global patterns and research priorities in impacts and management of rodent pests.Mamm. Rev. 2014; 44: 148-162Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar].

Ultimately, this extremely complex set of impacts affects the evolution of all organisms involved but, on an evolutionary ecology scale, it is currently unquantifiable. As a result, it might be best to simply categorise these interactions as fluctuating and complex rather than trying to define them as negative or neutral. Taxa categorised as 'commensal' are reasonably assumed to be exposed to selective pressures relating to their exploitation of the anthropogenic niche [12Pocock M.J.O. et al.Adaptations of animals to commensal habitats: population dynamics of house mice Mus musculus domesticus on farms.J. Anim. Ecol. 2004; 73: 878-888Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar]. However, just what the main characteristics of the anthropogenic niche are (beyond a simplistic view that it represents a concentration of resources associated in some way with humans) remains unexplored, and this has led to further broad assumptions being made about evolutionary pressures on proposed commensal taxa (e.g. [8Axelsson E. et al.The genomic signature of dog domestication reveals adaptation to a starch-rich diet.Nature. 2013; 495: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar]). Beyond the obvious settings of human-made structures and urban environments, it must also be recognised that agricultural environments are also subject to unpredictable and unseasonal human activity, resulting in 'unnatural' availability of resources. These too have a range of associated dependent taxa, often considered 'pests'. At low densities, such taxa might be considered to hold commensal relationships, but, as densities become higher, they might be viewed as competitors, although these categories are largely subjective. From an ecological and evolutionary perspective, these competing taxa inhabit an unpredictable and fluctuating anthropogenic environment similar to that experienced by many commensals and, therefore, can be considered anthrodependent with a commensal origin. Other discrepancies in definitions stem from a research bias towards small-bodied animals living in human-made structures [10Aplin K.P. et al.Evolutionary biology of the genus Rattus: profile of an archetypal rodent pest.in: Singleton G.R. Rats, Mice and People: Rodent Biology Management. ACIAR, 2003: 487-498Google Scholar, 12Pocock M.J.O. et al.Adaptations of animals to commensal habitats: population dynamics of house mice Mus musculus domesticus on farms.J. Anim. Ecol. 2004; 73: 878-888Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar]. Occupation of such structures sets an arbitrary definition of 'commensal taxa' with the result that comparisons of similar evolutionary processes experienced by large-bodied species are overlooked. In this way, a unifying definition and understanding is needed of 'commensal taxa' that allows an evolutionary understanding and is transferable between taxa (with varying body and home-range sizes) that occupy different anthropogenic environments and exploit diverse anthropogenic resources. Far more useful is to consider commensalism (and other related types of species interaction) in terms of the degree of dependence upon an anthropogenic niche (Figure 1). Dependency comes with both benefits and costs, which in turn drive the evolution of anthrodependent taxa [5Zeder M.A. Pathways to animal domestication.in: Gepts P. Biodiversity in Agriculture: Domestication, Evolution and Sustainability. Cambridge University Press, 2012: 227-259Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar]. Examining the selective pressures stemming from both benefits and costs provides a more appropriate framework that allows detailed insight into evolutionary processes specifically associated with past, present, and future anthropogenic environments. Only by interrogating the archaeological record will we gain a fuller understanding of the way such taxa evolve and adapt [13Weissbrod L. Biological indicators of occupation intensity: an environmental ethnoarchaeology of Maasai ettlements.in: Dean R.M. The Archaeology of Anthropogenic Environments. Illinois University Press, 2010: 295-320Google Scholar]. Humans have been actively altering the environment around them for thousands of years in what can be considered a form of niche construction [14Zeder M.A. Domestication as a model system for niche construction theory.Evol. Ecol. 2016; 30: 325-348Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar]. It is this constructed environment, and the abundance of resources within it, to which anthrodependent taxa have adapted and thrived. The extent of anthropogenic environments has increased through time [14Zeder M.A. Domestication as a model system for niche construction theory.Evol. Ecol. 2016; 30: 325-348Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar], as has the prevalence of commensal taxa [15Cucchi T. et al.On the trail of Neolithic mice and men towards Transcaucasia: zooarchaeological clues from Nakhchivan (Azerbaijan).Biol. J. Linn. Soc. 2013; 108: 917-928Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar]. The ability of a taxon to maintain access to anthropogenic environments dictates its success and evolution as an anthrodependant. In particular, this environment is often characterised by extreme and unpredictable fluctuations of resource availability and nest sites [12Pocock M.J.O. et al.Adaptations of animals to commensal habitats: population dynamics of house mice Mus musculus domesticus on farms.J. Anim. Ecol. 2004; 73: 878-888Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Newsome A.E. A population study of house-mice temporarily inhabiting a South Australian wheatfield.J. Anim. Ecol. 1969; 38: 341-359Crossref Google Scholar], characteristics that are frequently overlooked. It is often assumed that anthropogenic environments are more stable in terms of resource availability than are natural environments [17Anderies J.M. et al.Living in the city: resource availability, predation, and bird population dynamics in urban areas.J. Theor. Biol. 2007; 247: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar]. This is not always the case [12Pocock M.J.O. et al.Adaptations of animals to commensal habitats: population dynamics of house mice Mus musculus domesticus on farms.J. Anim. Ecol. 2004; 73: 878-888Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar]; neither was it likely to have been so throughout the past, when wild organisms first entered the anthropogenic niche [13Weissbrod L.

TITLE: Community Ecology and the Evolution of Molecules of Keystone Significance
ABSTRACT: Molecules of keystone significance are vital in structuring ecological communities. Select bioactive compounds can cause disproportionately large effects by connecting such seemingly disparate processes as microbial loop dynamics and apex predation. Here, we develop a general theory and propose mechanisms that could lead to the evolution of keystone molecules. Introduced into a respective community by one, or only a few, autotrophic or microbial species, these compounds often originate as chemical defenses. When co-opted by resistant consumer species, however, they are used either in chemical defense against higher-order predators or as chemosensory cues that elicit courtship and mating, alarm, and predatory search. Requisite to these multifunctional properties, biosynthetic capacity evolves along with mechanisms for resistance and/or toxin storage in primary producers. Subsequently, consumers acquire resistances or tolerances, and the toxins are transferred through food webs via trophic interactions. In consumers, mechanisms eventually evolve for recognizing toxins as feeding cues and, ultimately, as signals or pheromones in chemical communication within or between species. One, or a few, active compounds can thus mediate a vast array of physiological traits, expressed differentially across many species in a given community. Through convergent evolution, molecules of keystone significance provide critical information to phylogenetically diverse species, initiate major trophic cascades, and structure communities within terrestrial, freshwater, coastal-ocean and open-ocean habitats.

TITLE: Evolution of virulence: triggering host inflammation allows invading pathogens to exclude competitors
ABSTRACT: Abstract Virulence is generally considered to benefit parasites by enhancing resource‐transfer from host to pathogen. Here, we offer an alternative framework where virulent immune‐provoking behaviours and enhanced immune resistance are joint tactics of invading pathogens to eliminate resident competitors (transferring resources from resident to invading pathogen). The pathogen wins by creating a novel immunological challenge to which it is already adapted. We analyse a general ecological model of ‘proactive invasion’ where invaders not adapted to a local environment can succeed by changing it to one where they are better adapted than residents. However, the two‐trait nature of the ‘proactive’ strategy (provocation of, and adaptation to environmental change) presents an evolutionary conundrum, as neither trait alone is favoured in a homogenous host population. We show that this conundrum can be resolved by allowing for host heterogeneity. We relate our model to emerging empirical findings on immunological mediation of parasite competition.

TITLE: Soil‐mediated eco‐evolutionary feedbacks in the invasive plant Alliaria petiolata
ABSTRACT: Summary Ecological and evolutionary processes historically have been assumed to operate on significantly different time‐scales. We know now from theory and work in experimental and model systems that these processes can feed back on each other on mutually relevant time‐scales. Here, we present evidence of a soil‐mediated eco‐evolutionary feedback on the population dynamics of an invasive biennial plant, Alliaria petiolata. As populations age, natural selection drives down production of A. petiolata's important antimycorrhizal allelochemical, sinigrin. This occurs due to density‐dependent selection on sinigrin, which is favoured under interspecific, but disfavoured under intraspecific, competition. We show that population stochastic growth rates (λS) and plant densities are positively related to sinigrin concentration measured in seedling roots. This interaction is mediated by sinigrin's positive effect on seedling and summer survival, which are important drivers of λS. Together, these illustrate how the evolution of a trait shaped by natural selection can influence the ecology of a species over a period of just years to decades, altering its trajectory of population growth and interactions with the species in the soil and plant communities it invades. Our findings confirm the predictions that eco‐evolutionary feedbacks occur in natural populations. Furthermore, they improve our conceptual framework for projecting future population growth by linking the variation in plant demography to a critical competitive trait (sinigrin) whose selective advantages decrease as populations age.

TITLE: REVISITING THE CLASSICS: CONSIDERING NONCONSUMPTIVE EFFECTS IN TEXTBOOK EXAMPLES OF PREDATOR–PREY INTERACTIONS
ABSTRACT: Predator effects on prey dynamics are conventionally studied by measuring changes in prey abundance attributed to consumption by predators. We revisit four classic examples of predator-prey systems often cited in textbooks and incorporate subsequent studies of nonconsumptive effects of predators (NCE), defined as changes in prey traits (e.g., behavior, growth, development) measured on an ecological time scale. Our review revealed that NCE were integral to explaining lynx-hare population dynamics in boreal forests, cascading effects of top predators in Wisconsin lakes, and cascading effects of killer whales and sea otters on kelp forests in nearshore marine habitats. The relative roles of consumption and NCE of wolves on moose and consequent indirect effects on plant communities of Isle Royale depended on climate oscillations. Nonconsumptive effects have not been explicitly tested to explain the link between planktonic alewives and the size structure of the zooplankton, nor have they been invoked to attribute keystone predator status in intertidal communities or elsewhere. We argue that both consumption and intimidation contribute to the total effects of keystone predators, and that characteristics of keystone consumers may differ from those of predators having predominantly NCE. Nonconsumptive effects are often considered as an afterthought to explain observations inconsistent with consumption-based theory. Consequently, NCE with the same sign as consumptive effects may be overlooked, even though they can affect the magnitude, rate, or scale of a prey response to predation and can have important management or conservation implications. Nonconsumptive effects may underlie other classic paradigms in ecology, such as delayed density dependence and predator-mediated prey coexistence. Revisiting classic studies enriches our understanding of predator-prey dynamics and provides compelling rationale for ramping up efforts to consider how NCE affect traditional predator-prey models based on consumption, and to compare the relative magnitude of consumptive and NCE of predators.
