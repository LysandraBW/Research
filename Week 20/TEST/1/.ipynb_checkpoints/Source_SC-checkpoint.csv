https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13487,"Sexual dimorphism driven by intersexual resource competition: Why is it rare, and where to look for it?","Abstract Sexes often differ more obviously in secondary sexual characteristics than in traits that appear naturally selected, despite conceivable benefits to intersexual niche partitioning. Genetic constraints may play a role in limiting sex‐specific niche evolution; however, it is not clear why this limit should apply to naturally selected traits more than those under sexual selection; the latter routinely produces dimorphism. We ask whether ecological factors and/or features of the mating system limit dimorphism in resource use, or conversely, what conditions are the most permissible ones for sexual niche differences. The scale of mating competition and spatial variation in resource availability can help predict sexually dimorphic niches or the lack thereof. We investigate why and when dimorphism might fail to evolve even if genetic covariation between the sexes posed no constraint. Our analytical model incorporates the first aspect of spatial interactions (scale of mating competition). It is followed by simulations that explore broader conditions, including multiple resources with habitat heterogeneity, genetic correlations and non‐Gaussian resource‐use efficiency functions. We recover earlier known conditions for favourable conditions for the evolution of niche partitioning between sexes, such as narrow individual niche and low degrees of genetic constraint. We also show spatial considerations to alter this picture. Sexual niche divergence occurs more readily when local mating groups are small and different resources occur reliably across habitats. Polygyny (medium‐sized or large mating groups) can diminish the prospects for dimorphism even if no genetic constraints are present. Habitat heterogeneity typically also disfavours niche dimorphism but can also lead to polymorphism within a sex, if it is beneficial to specialize to be very competitive in one habitat, even at a cost to performance in the other. Sexual conflict is usually used to explain dimorphic traits or behaviours. Our models highlight that introducing conflict (achieved by switching from monogamy to polygamy) can also be responsible for sexual monomorphism. Under monogamy, males benefit from specializing to consume other resources than what feeds the female best. Polygyny makes males disregard this female benefit, and both sexes compete for the most profitable resource, leading to overlapping niches.",26080d5c546081ccb8a59f012f5435b4053c9eb4,,0
https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.02.074146,Close encounters of the three morphs: does color affect aggression in a polymorphic lizard?,"Color polymorphism is genetically controlled and the process generating and maintaining morphs can affect speciation and/or extinction rates. Competition and aggression among morphs can contribute to polymorphism maintenance and color badges are useful signals in intraspecific communication, because they convey information about alternative strategies and avoid unnecessary conflicts. This could lead to an uneven spatial distribution of morphs in a population, because the local frequency of each morph establishes the intensity of the competition in that neighborhood, and then the fitness of each male. We used a polymorphic lizard, Podarcis muralis, to assess if aggression varies among morphs under two contrasting hypotheses: a heteromorphic vs. a homomorphic aggression. We used laboratory mirror tests after lizard color manipulation and we verified the results consistency with the analysis of the spatial distribution of morphs in a wild population. Both the experiments confirmed that aggression is morph-specific and notably homomorphic. The adoption of behavioral alternative strategies that minimize risks and costs of unwanted conflicts could facilitate the stable coexistence of the phenotypes and reduce the resource competition. A bias in aggression to like-coloured males would advantage rarer morph, which would suffer less harassment by common morphs and obtain a fitness advantage. This process would be negatively-frequency-dependent and would stabilize polymorphism in the populations, possibly leading to sympatric speciation.",2f38dcf02d539b98631caf4e327260ff376e1f85,,0

Sexual dimorphism driven by intersexual resource competition: Why is it rare, and where to look for it? Journal of Animal Ecology, 00, 1-13. Ecological sexual dimorphism, that is differences between the sexes in traits that are naturally selected as opposed to sexually selected, is gaining increasing attention after having often been dismissed as the 'less-parsimonious' explanation for differences between sexes. One potential driver of ecological sexual dimorphism is intersexual resource competition, in a process analogous to ecological character displacement between species; yet, clear empirical examples are scarce. Li and Kokko present mathematical models that introduce novel pieces to the puzzle: the role of the scale of mating competition and the spatial variation in resource availability. They show that ecological sexual dimorphism evolves when local mating groups are small (e.g. monogamous pairs) and when different resources are homogeneously available across habitats. Counterintuitively, larger mating groups (e.g. polygyny), and consequently higher intralocus sexual conflict, lead to sexual monomorphism. Habitat heterogeneity also leads to overlapping niches, although it can sometimes drive polymorphism within sexes. This study highlights why the conditions for intrasexual resource competition to drive evolution of sexual dimorphism are stringent, even in the absence of genetic constraints or competing species. Crucially, it highlights the importance of considering the mating system and the spatial scale of resource competition for understanding the occurrence of ecological sexual dimorphism, showing a large potential for future work considering different aspects of species' life histories and spatial dynamics.",3f086f7e66cf7a17de08aef7861ed1220b2b34fc,,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13785,Eco‐evolutionary feedbacks between prey densities and linkage disequilibrium in the predator maintain diversity,"Diversity occurs at multiple scales. Within a single population, there is diversity in genotypes and phenotypes. At a larger scale, within ecological communities, there is diversity in species. A number of studies have investigated how diversity at these two scales influence each other through what has been termed eco‐evolutionary feedbacks. Here we study a three‐species ecological module called apparent competition, in which the predator is evolving in a trait that determines its interaction with two prey species. Unlike previous studies on apparent competition, which employed evolutionary frameworks with very simple genetics, we study an eco‐evolutionary model in which the predator's trait is determined by two recombining diallelic loci, so that its mean and variance can evolve, as well as associations (linkage disequilibrium) between the loci. We ask how eco‐evolutionary feedbacks with these two loci affect the coexistence of the prey species and the maintenance of polymorphisms within the predator species. We uncover a novel eco‐evolutionary feedback between the prey densities and the linkage disequilibrium between the predator's loci. Through a stability analysis, we demonstrate how these feedbacks affect polymorphisms at both loci and, among others, may generate stable cycling.",5c1f5eee4236efd0386a6133a849a9af121aeafb,,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/eff.12818,Patterns of Ecological Specialisation Among Multiple Piscivorous Morphs of a Diverse Assemblage of Salvelinus Fishes,"Adaptive radiation is considered to be a major source of biodiversity in charrs of the genus Salvelinus. These fishes demonstrate numerous examples of diversification in postglacial lakes and rivers resulting in the emergence of different ecomorphs, including piscivorous. Usually, the number of fish feeders does not exceed two, suggesting the existence of ecological and/or internal factors that prevent further diversification. Under these circumstances, rare instances of increases in the number of piscivorous morphs are of particular interest. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the piscivorous charr assemblage in Lake Kronotskoe, residence of the most diverse species flock of Salvelinus fishes. To unravel the diversity and ecological relationships of piscivorous charrs, we analysed their morphology and microsatellite DNA polymorphism, distribution within the lake, trophic preferences and parasite load, as well as trace element accumulation, stable isotope and free fatty acid ratios. We revealed that, apart from a few strictly benthivorous morphs, the lake is inhabited by four closely related but morphologically and genetically distinct morphs that exhibit a range of piscivorous specialisation: from opportunistic secondary predation to ultra‐specialised primary piscivory. They effectively exploit the spatiotemporal structure of the ecosystem and experience diversifying selection due to niche discordance. Each piscivorous morph develops specific phenotypic, ecological and life history traits that allow it to terminate weakly overlapping branches of the trophic chain and share the energy flows of the lake ecosystem. Our data suggest that Lake Kronotskoe facilitates high level of ecological opportunity that favours niche expansion and allows the piscivorous lineage to simultaneously realise the archetypical modes of ecological diversification available to fishes in cold‐water freshwaters.",73bfa03a7dbf10bbb419bc9d381d1be9b8118875,,0
