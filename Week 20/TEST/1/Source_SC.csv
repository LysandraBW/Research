https://doi.org/10.1086/723413,Canonical Host-Pathogen Trade-Offs Subverted by Mutations with Dual Benefits,"Host-parasite coevolution is expected to drive the evolution of genetic diversity because the traits used in arms races—namely, host range and parasite resistance—are hypothesized to trade off with traits used in resource competition. We therefore tested data for several trade-offs among 93 isolates of bacteriophage λ and 51 Escherichia coli genotypes that coevolved during a laboratory experiment. Surprisingly, we found multiple trade-ups (positive trait correlations) but little evidence of several canonical trade-offs. For example, some bacterial genotypes evaded a trade-off between phage resistance and absolute fitness, instead evolving simultaneous improvements in both traits. This was surprising because our experimental design was predicted to expose resistance-fitness trade-offs by culturing E. coli in a medium where the phage receptor, LamB, is also used for nutrient acquisition. On reflection, LamB mediates not one but many trade-offs, allowing for more complex trait interactions than just pairwise trade-offs. Here, we report that mathematical reasoning and laboratory data highlight how trade-ups should exist whenever an evolutionary system exhibits multiple interacting trade-offs. Does this mean that coevolution should not promote genetic diversity? No, quite the contrary. We deduce that whenever positive trait correlations are observed in multidimensional traits, other traits may trade off and so provide the right circumstances for diversity maintenance. Overall, this study reveals that there are predictive limits when data account only for pairwise trait correlations, and it argues that a wider range of circumstances than previously anticipated can promote genetic and species diversity.",0116074f232ccc0abe38fa7d62eb0d6240287de5,,0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-30469-3,Dynamic character displacement among a pair of bacterial phyllosphere commensals in situ,"Differences between species promote stable coexistence in a resource-limited environment. These differences can result from interspecies competition leading to character shifts, a process referred to as character displacement. While character displacement is often interpreted as a consequence of genetically fixed trait differences between species, it can also be mediated by phenotypic plasticity in response to the presence of another species. Here, we test whether phenotypic plasticity leads to a shift in proteome allocation during co-occurrence of two bacterial species from the abundant, leaf-colonizing families Sphingomonadaceae and Rhizobiaceae in their natural habitat. Upon mono-colonizing of the phyllosphere, both species exhibit specific and shared protein functions indicating a niche overlap. During co-colonization, quantitative differences in the protein repertoire of both bacterial populations occur as a result of bacterial coexistence in planta. Specifically, the Sphingomonas strain produces enzymes for the metabolization of xylan, while the Rhizobium strain reprograms its metabolism to beta-oxidation of fatty acids fueled via the glyoxylate cycle and adapts its biotin acquisition. We demonstrate the conditional relevance of cross-species facilitation by mutagenesis leading to loss of fitness in competition in planta. Our results show that dynamic character displacement and niche facilitation mediated by phenotypic plasticity can contribute to species coexistence. In this study, the concept of dynamic character displacement among interacting bacterial species from leaf-colonizing families was empirically tested using a proteomics approach. A phenotypic shift towards the utilization of alternative carbon sources was observed during coexistence, thereby minimizing niche overlap.",0250d8de5a0511b8e5f8f4625211ed02b4a6fbdc,,0

Theory shows that the positive frequency-dependent effects of such costly errors in mate recognition can dictate species coexistence or exclusion even with countervailing resource competition differences between species. While usually framed in terms of pre-mating or post-zygotic costs, reproductive interference manifests between individual Caenorhabditis nematodes from negative interspecies gametic interactions: sperm cells from interspecies matings can migrate ectopically to induce female sterility and premature death. The potential for reproductive interference to exert population level effects on Caenorhabditis trait evolution and community structure, however, remains unknown.ResultsHere we test whether a species that is superior in individual-level reproductive interference (C. nigoni) can exact negative demographic effects on competitor species that are superior in resource competition (C. briggsae and C. elegans). We observe coexistence over six generations and find evidence of demographic reproductive interference even under conditions unfavorable to its influence. C. briggsae and C. elegans show distinct patterns of reproductive interference in competitive interactions with C. nigoni.ConclusionsThese results affirm that individual level negative effects of reproductive interference mediated by gamete interactions can ramify to population demography, with the potential to influence patterns of species coexistence separately from the effects of direct resource competition.",02b4e51f2488263c9459baf19bef4015ea714fc5,,0
https://doi.org/10.1038/srep24369,Fine-scale behavioural differences distinguish resource use by ecomorphs in a closed ecosystem,"Temporal differences in habitat use and foraging specialisms between ecomorphs represent aspects of behavioural phenotype that are poorly understood with regard to the origin and maintenance of ecological diversity. We tested the role of behaviour in resource use divergence of two Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) phenotypes, a slim, putatively pelagic-dwelling morph and a robust, putatively littoral-dwelling generalist morph, over an annual cycle, using biotelemetry and stable isotopes. Pelagic morph charr exhibited significantly greater δC13 depletion, concordant with increased zooplanktivory, than for the Littoral morph. Although three-dimensional space-use of the morphs strongly overlapped, on average, the Littoral morph used that habitat 19.3% more than the Pelagic morph. Pelagic morph fish were significantly more active, further from the lake bed and at greater depth than Littoral fish (annual means respectively, Pelagic, 0.069BLs−1, 8.21 m and 14.11 m; Littoral, 0.047BLs−1, 5.87 m and 10.47 m). Patterns of habitat use differed between ecomorphs at key times, such as during autumn and at ice break, likely related to spawning and resumption of intensive foraging respectively. Extensive space-use overlap, but fine-scale differences in habitat use between charr ecomorphs, suggests the importance of competition for generating and maintaining polymorphism, and its potential for promoting reproductive isolation and evolution in sympatry.",04aea2d671ba70122f0c2e0dde8c95e54b84608a,,0

This study aimed to elucidate how seed traits influence infestation dynamics and species interactions, focusing on acorn weevils infesting Quercus mongolica. Species identification and clarification of their evolutionary relationships within the Curculio genus were performed through phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene sequences. The seed infestation patterns were assessed by comparing the infestation rates across various seed size classes. Furthermore, the correlations between the seed morphological traits (length, width, aspect ratio, and weight) and weevil abundance were analyzed. The phylogenetic results revealed well-supported monophyletic clades corresponding to Curculio arakawai and Curculio sikkimensis. This confirmed the clear genetic separation between these two distinct weevil species, thereby substantiating the divergence observed in weevil populations correlated with different seed hosts. The infestation patterns revealed the association of weevil species-specific preferences with seed size: C. arakawai predominantly infested larger acorn seeds, whereas C. sikkimensis predominantly infested smaller acorn seeds. C. sikkimensis favored smaller ones. Both species exhibited positive correlations between abundance and seed length and width in larger seeds; however, the seed weight displayed no significant effect. These results indicate niche differentiation mediated by seed size and morphology, which likely reduced interspecific competition and facilitated coexistence. This study elucidates species-specific host selection patterns in acorn weevils and highlights acorn traits as crucial factors shaping seed predator assemblages. The findings provide valuable insights for developing targeted pest management strategies and supporting sustainable oak forest regeneration.",07808f9ca2a186d5d649471839944b8f2ca81202,,0
https://doi.org/10.2307/1564855,Effects of egg size and density on metamorphic traits in tadpoles of the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita),"-We examined whether intrapopulational variation in egg size was correlated with developmental rates and metamorphic traits of natterjack toads (Bufo calamita) grown at different experimental densities. Mean egg size of siblings was positively correlated with both mean size of hatchlings at the initiation of feeding and mean developmental rates to the feeding stage. However, size at and survival to metamorphosis were not related to ovum or hatchling size. At high densities tadpoles had slower growth rates, longer larval periods, and lower survival, and were smaller at metamorphosis. Length of larval period was inversely related to early tadpole growth rate for all densities. Mass at metamorphosis was positively correlated to tadpole growth rate, except at high densities. Size at metamorphosis was inversely related to length of larval period at low densities, but relationships were inconsistent at higher densities. Egg size in amphibians has been viewed as a resource tradeoff for females with limited energy for reproduction. This notion is derived in part from optimality models predicting that for each environment there is an optimal offspring size (Smith and Fretwell, 1974; Brockelman, 1975). Others have suggested that optimality theory is contradicted by the high degree of intraclutch egg size variability observed in amphibians (Kaplan, 1980; Crump, 1981). Egg size variability may be adaptive in unpredictable environments such as temporary ponds where the intensity of competition may vary annually. Larvae from larger eggs would be favored in competitive environments due to their initial size advantage, while in noncompetitive environments larger and smaller hatchlings would be equally successful. By producing eggs of mixed sizes females may increase their fitness relative to those following a pure strat146 This content downloaded from 207.46.13.57 on Fri, 09 Sep 2016 04:31:37 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms METAMORPHOSIS IN NATTERJACK TOADS egy (Crump, 1984; Kaplan and Cooper, 1984). This reasoning assumes a positive correlation between egg size and larval fitness in competitive environments. Hence, under this view the covariation is environmentally mediated, and the effect of egg size on larval fitness should be related to population density or food availability (Kaplan, 1985; Berven and Chadra, 1988). In temporary ponds, the length of larval period may be an important fitness component because it is inversely related to larval survival. In some amphibians, individuals that grow relatively fast metamorphose earlier (Wilbur and Collins, 1973; Collins, 1979; Smith-Gill and Berven, 1979; Travis, 1981, 1983, 1984) and may be less susceptible to size-selective predators (Heyer et al., 1975; Brodie and Formanowicz, 1983). Further, time to and size at metamorphosis may have strong ecological implications related to long-term fitness since both can affect juvenile survival, age at first reproduction, or level of adult fecundity (Smith, 1987; Semlitsch et al., 1988; Berven, 1990). The relationship between these two traits is controlled largely by the environment (Travis, 1984), and may vary in consistency and direction. A gradual drop in water temperature during a cohort's development may produce a positive covariation between traits (Smith-Gill and Berven, 1979). Likewise, covariation may result from competitive release as fast-growing tadpoles undergo metamorphosis and leave the pond. Remaining tadpoles may then have higher growth rates as a result of an increase in the per capita food ration (Collins, 1979). Negative or random covariations may be the result of an environmental decline in per capita food level that is not counterbalanced by competitive release of metamorphs (Alford and Harris, 1988). It also may be the result of heterogeneous environmental effects (Travis, 1984). The natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) breeds in temporary ponds, and is often the only amphibian species present. Tadpole developmental time is short and may last less than 30 d. However, under crowded conditions individuals may extend their larval development up to 80 d. This implies a greater mortality and total absence of metamorphic success in dry years (Tejedo, 1992a); hence, faster growth rate may be highly adaptive. Much variation in egg size exists within populations, and this variation is related to female body size (Tejedo, 1992a). In this report we examined in the laboratory the relationships between two maternally induced variables (egg size and early hatchling size) and four fitness traits: size at metamorphosis; time of development; growth rate; and survival. The relationship was assessed for larvae of different sibships from a single population, under a range of density treatments. Moreover, growth trajectories and covariation between body size at metamorphosis and developmental time were analyzed across the different densities. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 41 egg clutches of B. calamita was sampled from a breeding pond at Sierra Morena, C6rdoba, Spain, during January 1988, ca. 12 h after oviposition, and the eggs were between midand late cleavage (stage 8-9; Gosner, 1960) when they were measured. Average egg size was determined by measuring the diameter of 10 randomly-selected eggs from each clutch. For each egg, the diameter was measured to the nearest 0.02 mm with a dissecting microscope and ocular micrometer. From each clutch, we selected 20 eggs within 0.05 mm of the average diameter. These were allowed to develop to Gosner stage 25 (initial feeding phase), at which time the tadpoles were measured and randomly assigned to four experimental densities consisting of either 1 (D1), 2 (D2), 4 (D4), or 8 (D8) individuals per container. Each group of tadpoles was placed in 15 cm diameter plastic pans that contained 250 ml of dechlorinated tap water. The range of experimental densities was similar to that observed in the pond (5-1000 tadpoles/m2; Tejedo, unpubl. data). Tadpoles were fed and the water changed three times per week. Each pan initially received 30 mg of Purina rabbit chow per feeding. Food rations were increased to 70 mg after 30 d of growth. The ration was kept constant throughout the experiment despite the fact that tadpoles in some treatments died or reached metamorphic climax. Food levels at the lower densities (1-2 tadpoles per pan) allowed unlimited growth. However, tadpoles at higher densities (4 and 8 individuals per pan) normally consumed their food by the second and first day after feeding, respectively. The experiment was conducted in laboratory conditions with natural light. Temperature oscillated around 1416 C. We measured snout-to-tail base and total length of tadpoles 15, 30, and 45 d after the start of the experiment. Both length measures minimized handling of tadpoles and were highly correlated with tadpole weight (total length, r2 = 0.801; snout-to-tail base length, r2 = 0.781, n = 53, P 0.20). Consequently, data from different clutches were used as replicates of the density experiment. Tadpole cohorts were considered to be an experimental unit and analyses were performed on their mean values. All larval fitness variables were logetransformed to meet the assumption of homogeneity of variances among densities. Tadpole survivorship was arcsin-transformed to meet the assumptions of a normal distribution and homogeneity of variances among densities. Heterogeneity in variance among densities was observed for metamorphic size and growth rate and therefore a Kruskal-Wallis test was used (Zar, 1984). Linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between metamorphic size and developmental time. The best linear model was fitted with the aid of the Statgraphic Statistical package (STSC Inc., 1986). Analysis of intraclutch egg size variability was determined by measuring a randomly selected sample of 90-110 eggs from each of 10 clutches collected in the same population during the 1989 breeding season. Coefficients of variation (CV) for egg size were calculated. In addition, skewness (g,) and kurtosis (g2) were computed; these values were compared to the expected parametric values in a normal distribution (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981).",07ac5b59ba4916f5a4b484d75627059e17cdc971,,0

Predation, for example, can be stronger at lower latitudes, while competition can intensify at later stages of assembly due to resource limitation. Since biotic filters act upon functional traits of organisms, we explored trait-mediated community assembly in diverse marine assemblages from four regions along the Pacific coast of North and Central America. Using predator exclusion experiments and two assembly stages, we tested the hypotheses that non-random trait patterns would emerge during late assembly at all regions due to competition and at lower latitude regions regardless of assembly stage due to predation. As expected, trait divergence occurred in late assembly but only at higher latitude regions, while in tropical Panama, relaxed predation caused trait divergence during late assembly. Moreover, colonizing trait strategies were common during early assembly while competitive strategies were favoured during late assembly at higher latitude regions. Predation-resistant traits were only favoured in Panama during both assembly stages. Our large-scale manipulative study demonstrates that different biotic interactions across time and latitude can have important consequences for trait assembly.",0b1b88cdf20ca66859eec1b9d8f8b08138980548,,0

https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.224824,Conspecific chemical cues drive density-dependent metabolic suppression independently of resource intake,"ABSTRACT Within species, individuals of the same size can vary substantially in their metabolic rate. One source of variation in metabolism is conspecific density – individuals in denser populations may have lower metabolism than those in sparser populations. However, the mechanisms through which conspecifics drive metabolic suppression remain unclear. Although food competition is a potential driver, other density-mediated factors could act independently or in combination to drive metabolic suppression, but these drivers have rarely been investigated. We used sessile marine invertebrates to test how food availability interacts with oxygen availability, water flow and chemical cues to affect metabolism. We show that conspecific chemical cues induce metabolic suppression independently of food and this metabolic reduction is associated with the downregulation of physiological processes rather than feeding activity. Conspecific cues should be considered when predicting metabolic variation and competitive outcomes as they are an important, but underexplored, source of variation in metabolic traits. Summary: Conspecific chemical cues induce metabolic suppression independently of food, and this metabolic reduction is associated with the downregulation of physiological processes rather than feeding activity.",0c5dd6ad9fe6509c596895205ae2a66e9a3c5a5d,,0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029487,Selection against Accumulating Mutations in Niche-Preference Genes Can Drive Speciation,"Our current understanding of sympatric speciation is that it occurs primarily through disruptive selection on ecological genes driven by competition, followed by reproductive isolation through reinforcement-like selection against inferior intermediates/heterozygotes. Our evolutionary model of selection on resource recognition and preference traits suggests a new mechanism for sympatric speciation. We find speciation can occur in three phases. First a polymorphism of functionally different phenotypes is established through evolution of specialization. On the gene level, regulatory functions have evolved in which some alleles are conditionally switched off (i.e. are silent). These alleles accumulate harmful mutations that potentially may be expressed in offspring through recombination. Second mating associated with resource preference invades because harmful mutations in parents are not expressed in the offspring when mating assortatively, thereby dividing the population into two pre-zygotically isolated resource-specialist lineages. Third, silent alleles that evolved in phase one now accumulate deleterious mutations over the following generations in a Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller fashion, establishing a post-zygotic barrier to hybridization.",0e25a18b01af535f7a0fb2621719700201751362,,0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013245,Evolution of foraging behaviour induces variable complexity-stability relationships in mutualist-exploiter-predator communities,"Early ecological theory predicts that complex ecological networks are unstable and are unlikely to persist, despite many empirical studies of such complexity in nature. This inconsistency has fascinated ecologists for decades. To resolve the complexity-stability debate, coupling population dynamics and trait dynamics is considered to be an important way to understand the long-term stability of ecological community assemblages. However, we still do not know how eco-evolutionary feedbacks affect the relationship between complexity and stability in ecologically realistic networks with both antagonistic and mutualistic interactions. Here, we explored an adaptive network model to evaluate how the evolution of foraging preference to determine the relationship between network complexity (i.e., connectance) and stability (i.e., community persistence at steady state) in mutualist-exploiter-predator communities (MEST). Our theoretical results showed: (i) adaptive foraging of the top predator contributes to the stability of mutualism and intermediate intensity of foraging adaptations can lead to chaotic dynamics in a four-species MEST community; (ii) the complexity-stability relationship may show positive monotonic, negative monotonic, peaked and double-peaked patterns in general MEST communities, while the double-peaked pattern is only obtained when both the adaptation intensity and interspecific competition are high. Furthermore, model predictions may be consistent with both the negative monotonic pattern revealed in freshwater communities and the peaked pattern revealed in marine communities. Finally, we infer that foraging adaptations of the top predator may alter positive or/and negative feedback loops (trait-mediated indirect effects) to affect the stability of general MEST communities. Our adaptive network framework may provide an effective way to address the complexity-stability debate in real ecosystems.",0e76d546d355fe15e230cae355a0ac49bc386933,,0

 Parasitism can affect the population dynamics in many ways, and its indirect effect is easy to be ignored, that is, it can weaken the host's behavior, physiology and psychology to affect the whole population. In this paper, we build a differential equation model by adding four parameters to study the influence of multiple competitive relationships on the predator-prey system, It includes the enhancement effect g of intraspecific competition and the enhancement effect h of interspecific competition between susceptible population and infected population, the weakening effect m of intraspecific competition and the weakening effect n of interspecific competition between susceptible population and infected population. Through the analysis, it can be concluded that a single g or m can promote the symbiosis of predator and prey, a single h has little effect on the population dynamics, and a single n is not conducive to the symbiosis; The fusion of g and h promotes coexistence, but the fusion of m and n is on the contrary; Interestingly, the combination of multiple regulatory parameters has a chemical effect on the survival of species, but the combination of g, m and h can inhibit coexistence, while the combination of g, m and n can promote coexistence. The reason is that the combination of parameters is not a simple addition of effects, but a prerequisite for mutual influence. To sum up, the research content provides a reference for considering the role of multiple factors, and provides theoretical guidance for explaining ecological phenomena and proving ecological conclusions.",0f32d0abd9217024945260dcb78860db55e59fa2,,0
https://doi.org/10.1890/08-2291.1,Intraspecific competition between co-infecting parasite strains enhances host survival in African trypanosomes.,"It is becoming increasingly clear that under natural conditions parasitic infections commonly consist of co-infections with multiple conspecific strains. Multiple-strain infections lead to intraspecific interactions and may have important ecological and evolutionary effects on both hosts and parasites. However, experimental evidence on intraspecific competition or facilitation in infections has been scarce because of the technical challenges of distinguishing and tracking individual co-infecting strains. To overcome this limitation, we engineered transgenic strains of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, the causal agent of human African sleeping sickness. Different strains were transfected with fluorescence genes of different colors to make them visually distinguishable in order to investigate the effects of multiple-strain infections on parasite population dynamics and host fitness. We infected mice either with each strain alone or with mixes of two strains. Our results show a strong mutual competitive suppression of co-infecting T. brucei strains very early in infection. This mutual suppression changes within-host parasite dynamics and alleviates the effects of infection on the host. The strength of suppression depends on the density of the co-infecting strain, and differences in life-history traits between the strains determine the consequences of strain-strain competition for the host. Unexpectedly, co-infection with a less virulent strain significantly enhances host survival (+15%). Analysis of the strain dynamics reveals that this is due to the suppression of the density of the more virulent strain (-33%), whose degree of impact ultimately determines the physical condition of the host. The competitive suppression is likely caused by allelopathic interference or by apparent competition mediated by strain-specific immune responses. These findings highlight the importance of intraspecific variation for parasite-parasite and parasite-host interactions. To fully understand parasite and disease dynamics, the genetic diversity of infections must be taken into account. Through changes in parasite dynamics, intraspecific variation may further affect transmission dynamics and select for increased virulence of each strain. The precise mechanisms underlying mutual suppression are not yet understood but may be exploitable to fight this devastating parasite. Our results are therefore not only of basic ecological interest investigating an important form of intraspecific competition, but may also have applied relevance for public health.",0fb66e1c3cc37adffa140cd2a936b637e99c79ec,,0

Pollination by non‐syrphid flies, such as bee flies (Bombylius major L., Bombyliidae, Diptera), has often been underappreciated. Bee flies represent a diverse group of long‐tongue nectar‐feeding insects that are often reported as generalists who visit flowers indiscriminately. Here, we used individual‐based pollen transport networks to assess patterns of individual foraging in bee flies over two flowering seasons in a diverse co‐flowering community. Using this approach, we uncover the structure (e.g., modular vs. nested) of bee fly individual foraging and the degree of individual specialisation. We further evaluate the role of resource availability (floral abundance) and intraspecific trait variation (proboscis length and body size) in shaping individual specialisation. Overall, bee flies visited 20 different plant species. However, network analysis shows that individuals are more specialised and tend to partition the floral resource as reflected by the high degree of network modularity. Most bee fly individuals concentrate their foraging on only a few floral resources (two to four plant species) suggesting strong niche partitioning in this group of pollinators. This modular foraging pattern was not explained by differences in resource availability over the season. Proboscis length, however, was negatively related to the level of individual specialisation. Individuals with larger proboscis had larger foraging niches (less specialisation) perhaps due to easier access to a wide range of plant species with different floral tube sizes. Overall, our study reveals high individual specialisation and niche partitioning in bee‐fly interactions, mediated by differences in proboscis length, and with important implications for pollen transfer dynamics, plant–plant competition and plant reproductive success in diverse co‐flowering communities.",10738526b7a883caa08d359d83eaabc103b0b988,,0

https://doi.org/10.1890/04-1136,ECOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF A RESOURCE POLYMORPHISM IN ZENAIDA DOVES OF BARBADOS,"Despite the important place of resource polymorphisms in ecological and evolutionary theories, the reason why a group of individuals sharing a common environment should diverge in the use of the resources remains poorly known. Given the existence of distinct open niches and the relaxation of interspecific competition, niche theory suggests two possible mechanisms: resource competition between conspecifics and trade-offs in resource use efficiency. We investigated the importance of these explanations in a foraging polymorphism recently developed by Zenaida Doves (Zenaida aurita) on the West Indian island of Barbados. In this polymorphism, individuals either aggressively defend feeding territories from conspecifics or feed in large unaggressive groups with conspecifics. Com- bining field observations and a cage experiment, we found no evidence that the polymor- phism is primarily driven by age- or sex-related differences, or that it results from mor- phological feeding specializations or dietary preferences. Instead, our results support the hypothesis that individual specializations arise from contest competition. In the study area, competition for territories was intense, with very little undefended space left between territories and owners frequently involved in territorial contests. Replacement of territory holders from year to year was low compared to the number of potential recruits, implying that many doves were incapable of securing a territory. Approximately half the doves at territorial sites did not hold a territory but wandered between them as floaters. Compared with territory holders, floaters were smaller and had shorter wings, traits that in this species mediate territory defense. Yet floaters did not differ from group feeding doves on these morphological traits. This suggests that group feeders are floaters that shift to an alternative resource. The new resource appears to be suboptimal, as indicated by the fact that group feeders were in worse body condition than doves from the territorial sites. Taken together, our results suggest that the resource polymorphism in Zenaida Doves is primarily driven by competition for territories, which forces less competitive individuals to use alternative, subobtimal resources.",13274411bc0c20768eadd7f9a08dd4bcb6d2ff98,,0

https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2103162118,Growth–defense trade-offs shape population genetic composition in an iconic forest tree species,"Significance Genetic diversity is critical for ecological resilience and is maintained when different traits are advantageous in different environments. Traits are not entirely independent, however: When trade-offs occur, selection on one trait may indirectly act on another. Here we examine how environmentally mediated selection for growth interacts with a trade-off between growth and herbivore defense in experimental aspen stands. We show that even an environmentally fixed trait trade-off can lead to real-time divergence in population genetic composition between environments. The underlying growth–defense trade-off led to an eco-evolutionary dynamic wherein high-competition environments selected for fast-growing trees and thus ultimately selected against herbivore resistance. This discovery reveals how patterns of genetic covariation, coupled with environmental variation, can link ecological and evolutionary processes. All organisms experience fundamental conflicts between divergent metabolic processes. In plants, a pivotal conflict occurs between allocation to growth, which accelerates resource acquisition, and to defense, which protects existing tissue against herbivory. Trade-offs between growth and defense traits are not universally observed, and a central prediction of plant evolutionary ecology is that context-dependence of these trade-offs contributes to the maintenance of intraspecific variation in defense [Züst and Agrawal, Annu. Rev. Plant Biol., 68, 513–534 (2017)]. This prediction has rarely been tested, however, and the evolutionary consequences of growth–defense trade-offs in different environments are poorly understood, especially in long-lived species [Cipollini et al., Annual Plant Reviews (Wiley, 2014), pp. 263–307]. Here we show that intraspecific trait trade-offs, even when fixed across divergent environments, interact with competition to drive natural selection of tree genotypes corresponding to their growth–defense phenotypes. Our results show that a functional trait trade-off, when coupled with environmental variation, causes real-time divergence in the genetic architecture of tree populations in an experimental setting. Specifically, competitive selection for faster growth resulted in dominance by fast-growing tree genotypes that were poorly defended against natural enemies. This outcome is a signature example of eco-evolutionary dynamics: Competitive interactions affected microevolutionary trajectories on a timescale relevant to subsequent ecological interactions [Brunner et al., Funct. Ecol. 33, 7–12 (2019)]. Eco-evolutionary drivers of tree growth and defense are thus critical to stand-level trait variation, which structures communities and ecosystems over expansive spatiotemporal scales.",14c9352609fd2cfb8e78eddf51613281890ad75b,,0

Some rare blood group screening programs have been implemented in western countries and Japan, but not particularly in China. Recently, the genetic background of ABO and Rh blood groups for different ethnic groups or regions in China has been focused on increasingly. However, rare blood groups such as MN, Duffy, Kidd, MNS, and Diego are largely unexplored. No systematic reports exist concerning the polymorphisms and allele frequencies of rare blood groups in China's ethnic minorities such as Uygur and Kazak populations of Xinjiang, unlike those on the Han population. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the allele frequencies of rare blood groups, namely, MNS, Duffy, Kell, Dombrock, Diego, Kidd, Scianna, Colton, and Lutheran in the Uygur population of Xinjiang Single specific primer-polymerase chain reaction was performed for genotyping and statistical analysis of 9 rare blood groups in 158 Uygur individuals. Allele frequencies were compared with distribution among other ethnic groups. Observed and expected values of genotype frequencies were compared using the chi-square test. Genotype frequencies obeyed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P > 0.5) and allele frequencies were stable. Of all subjects detected, 4 cases carried the rare phenotype S-s- of MNS blood group (frequency of 0.0253), and 1 case carried the phenotype Jka-b- (frequency of 0.0063). Frequencies of the four groups, MNS, Duffy, Dombrock, and Diego, in the Uygur population differed from those in other ethnic groups. Gene distribution of the Kell, Kidd, and Colton was similar to that in Tibetan and Han populations, though there were some discrepancies. Gene distribution of Scianna and Lutheran groups showed monomorphism similar to that in Tibetan and Han populations. These findings could contribute to the investigation of the origin, evolution, and hematology of Uygur population of Xinjiang and assist in screening of rare blood groups in ethnic minorities, meeting of clinical blood supply demands, and building of the national rare blood group library.",158e4ffbb1677a2b19c2c82d5491c3d269cd210c,,0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2003563,Contrasting impacts of competition on ecological and social trait evolution in songbirds,"Competition between closely related species has long been viewed as a powerful selective force that drives trait diversification, thereby generating phenotypic diversity over macroevolutionary timescales. However, although the impact of interspecific competition has been documented in a handful of iconic insular radiations, most previous studies have focused on traits involved in resource use, and few have examined the role of competition across large, continental radiations. Thus, the extent to which broad-scale patterns of phenotypic diversity are shaped by competition remain largely unclear, particularly for social traits. Here, we estimate the effect of competition between interacting lineages by applying new phylogenetic models that account for such interactions to an exceptionally complete dataset of resource-use traits and social signaling traits for the entire radiation of tanagers (Aves, Thraupidae), the largest family of songbirds. We find that interspecific competition strongly influences the evolution of traits involved in resource use, with a weaker effect on plumage signals, and very little effect on song. Our results provide compelling evidence that interspecific exploitative competition contributes to ecological trait diversification among coexisting species, even in a large continental radiation. In comparison, signal traits mediating mate choice and social competition seem to diversify under different evolutionary models, including rapid diversification in the allopatric stage of speciation.",15ab0c31c232d716ffe48f6a25eac008e2bbe64c,,0
https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[14:SEOPNC]2.0.CO;2,Simultaneous effects of phylogenetic niche conservatism and competition on avian community structure.,"We currently have only a partial understanding of how phylogenetic relationships relate to patterns of community structure, in part because, for most groups of organisms, we do not know the extent to which ecological similarity results from common ancestry. Associations between phylogenetic relatedness and local community structure are particularly interesting for groups in which many species that span a gradient of phylogenetic divergence occur in potential sympatry. We explored the relationship between evolutionary relatedness and current species co-occurrence among the North American wood-warblers (Aves: Parulidae), a group of songbirds known both for its species diversity and for exhibiting high levels of sympatry at breeding sites. Species co-occurrences were derived from North American Breeding Bird Survey transects comprising 160,000 census points distributed across North America. The nested point-within-transect structure of this survey provides an unusual opportunity to remove larger-scale geographical effects on local community composition and thereby consider patterns of co-occurrence only among regionally sympatric pairs of species. We indexed evolutionary relatedness among all pairs of taxa by genetic distances based on long mitochondrial DNA protein-coding sequences. Most regionally sympatric taxon pairs rarely co-occur at local sites, and the most closely related never exhibit high local co-occurrences, as predicted if past or present competitive effects are strongest for these recently separated lineages. Quantile regression shows that, for a subset of taxa, local co-occurrence does increase with time since common ancestry, and that this apparent relaxation of competitive exclusion is strongest for distantly related species that have differentiated in fundamental ecological and behavioral traits, such as terrestrial vs. arboreal foraging. Comparisons against a null model of species co-occurrence further demonstrate that these patterns occur against a background of phylogenetic niche conservatism: across all phylogenetic distances, sympatric species co-occurred at higher rates than expected by chance, a pattern that might stem from a tendency by these species to show conservatism in their selection of similar general habitat types. Considered in concert, these analyses suggest the simultaneous mediation of local community structure by the ecological similarity of closely related species and by trait divergence among a subset of more distant lineages.",162db2984962256a753df186764f1f41a303e8a9,,0

Some of the species with a fast reproductive cycle strategy and relying on primary productivity may rapidly respond to such changes with alterations to demographic parameters. However, how these bottom‐up effects may emerge in systems with different population dynamics has not been elucidated. We aimed to assess the role of food availability on rodent demography in populations characterised by different dynamics, that is multiannual cycles in Northern European populations and mast‐driven outbreaks in Southern European populations, both driven by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We live‐trapped woodland rodents at these latitudinal extremes in two study systems (Norway, Italy) while deploying control/treatment designs of food manipulation providing ad libitum trophic resource availability, albeit not reflecting the natural resource fluctuations. We applied a multistate open robust design model to estimate population patterns and survival rates while controlling for seasonal variation, intrinsic traits, and co‐occurrence of sympatric species. Yellow‐necked and wood mouse (Apodemus spp.) were sympatric with bank vole ( Clethrionomys glareolus ) in Italy, while only the latter was trapped in Norway. Food provisioning increased both survival and population size of bank vole in Norway, where temperatures are harsher and snow cover persists in winter. In milder Italian habitats, the wood mouse abundance was boosted by food availability, increasing also survival rates (but only in females), whereas the bank vole showed a decrease in both parameters across sexes. We speculate that overabundant food resources may trigger some forms of competition between sympatric wood mouse and bank vole, although other types of interactions, such as predation and parasitism, may also contribute. By manipulating food availability in two systems where rodents have different population dynamics, we showed how resource availability exerted bottom‐up effects on rodent demography, especially in the context of climate change, although being mediated by other intrinsic and extrinsic factors.",1639ff2351a63e233b9d163e7c2cadf5c1d82cbf,,0

Here we examine the potential that root traits may evolve as a target of selection from interspecific competition using Ipomoea purpurea and I. hederacea, two closely related morning glory species that commonly co-occur in the United States. We show that belowground competitive interactions between the two species can alter the pattern of selection on root traits in each species. Specifically, competition with I. purpurea changes the pattern of selection on root angle in I. hederacea, and competitive interactions with I. hederacea changes the pattern of selection on root size in I. purpurea. However, we did not uncover evidence that intraspecific competition altered the pattern of selection on any root traits within I. hederacea. Overall, our results suggest that belowground competition between closely related species can influence the phenotypic evolution of root traits in natural populations. Our findings provide a microevolutionary perspective of how competitive belowground interactions may impact plant fitness, potentially leading to patterns of plant community structure.",1728c6fcaa718504355c873c75634ff57272ff0d,,0

https://doi.org/10.2307/4087613,Some problems and approaches in avian mate choice,"-Most studies of mate choice in birds consider questions such as the existence of mate choice, which traits are preferred, and how the preferences evolved. In order to answer these questions, it is necessary to distinguish between pairs of key processes such as dominance and choice, assortative mating and type preference, or male choice and female choice. We review these and other difficulties in the study of avian mate choice. As an illustration of methodological issues, we discuss our work on Pinyon Jays (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus). Males that were successful in mate-choice experiments were more brightly colored and had large testes, but were not necessarily larger or dominant. Preferred females were large, dominant, and had thicker bills. In free-living populations, smaller than average males and larger than average females lived longer. Pairs composed of small males and large females had sons with higher fecundities and greater survivorship. We suggest that many ornithologists could combine their long-term field observations with controlled experiments to profitably study mate choice. Received 27 January 1989, accepted 6 November 1989. THE AREA of sexual selection is currently one of the most controversial and rapidly developing in biology (Andersson and Bradbury 1987). There is a large body of theory on sexual selection; and an increasing number of empirical studies, particularly of mate choice, focus on birds (e.g. Komers and Dhindsa 1989, Zuk et al. in press a, b). Empirical studies often fail because they do not address important theoretical questions, their methodology does not allow discrimination of key processes, or both. Our discussion of the first problem is brief, as this topic is reviewed in detail elsewhere (Arnold 1985, Bradbury and Andersson 1987). We focus here on commonly encountered methodological difficulties in the empirical study of avian mate choice. We suggest approaches to these problems and provide an example from work with captive and free-living Pinyon Jays (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) that illustrates some of these methodological issues. DIFFICULTIES IN THE STUDY OF MATE CHOICE A central theoretical question is how female choice can affect the evolution of secondary sex characteristics. Closely associated is the question of how the mating preferences themselves 3Current address: Department of Ecology, Ethology, and Evolution, University of Illinois, 606 East Healey, Champaign, Illinois 61820 USA. 4Current address: Star Route Box 2905, Dryden, Maine 04225 USA. evolved. The considerable theory in this area offers numerous questions for empiricists to address (Heisler et al. 1987). Empirical studies of female choice usually begin with the question of whether female mating preferences for particular male traits exist. Identifying traits.-The first difficulty in investigating mate choice is to decide which traits might be important. If there are field data for the species of interest, one can identify traits used in courtship displays, search for correlations between specific traits and mating or reproductive success, or look for assortative mating with respect to specific traits. These traits suggest a starting point for experimental study. If there are no relevant field data, theory and common sense can suggest traits for experimentation. Ideally, one should then go to the field to determine the fitness consequences for individuals with the preferred traits. Is mating nonrandom?-Once appropriate traits have been identified, it is necessary to document nonrandom mating for the traits of interest. Standard statistical procedures can be applied to the results of laboratory experiments. In the field, however, it can be unclear whether an observed pattern is the result of preferences for a particular trait (type preference; Burley 1983) or prevalence of that trait in the pool of prospective mates at the time mating occurs (Cooke and Davies 1983). For example, in several bird species, the ages of partners are correlated (Reid 1988). Reid (1988) has shown that, with stable pair bonds, such correlations can 296 The Auk 107: 296-304. April 1990 This content downloaded from 157.55.39.132 on Thu, 15 Sep 2016 05:06:37 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms April 1990] Avian Mate Choice 297 occur in the absence of mate choice, through random mating alone. To investigate apparent nonrandom mating patterns, it is not appropriate to apply standard statistical procedures (such as Chi-square approximations or correlation analyses) to the traits of a free-living population of existing pairs, because these tests require that different pair bonds form independently. Mate pools are finite, and once two individuals in a finite mate pool pair, the remaining individuals have reduced choices that depend on previous choices. In monogamous species, this continues until the last two individuals have no choice but to pair with one another. Such clearly dependent events cannot be analyzed with parametric or nonparametric tests of association. Randomization procedures can avoid this problem by comparing all possible (random) pairings at a given time with the pairings actually observed (Marzluff and Balda 1988b, Johnston and Johnson 1989). For this approach, it is necessary to know which individuals were available in the mate pool at the beginning of the pairing period and calculate the N! possible patterns that can be formed between N males and N females. Nonrandomness of the observed pairing pattern is calculated by determining how rare that pattern is relative to all possible patterns. Factors confounding choice. -To decide whether nonrandom mating patterns are the result of mate choice, it is necessary to rule out the process of intrasexual competition as a complicating factor. Consider female choice of males in a typical nonterritorial species in which males usually show behavioral dominance to females. If nonrandom mating occurs, it can be unclear whether the mating pattern is a result of female preference for certain male types or whether intra-male competition allows dominant males to monopolize access to females. Even when females appear to choose males, male-male competition can mediate female choice. For example, female American Wigeons (Anas americana) mate more often with larger, heavier adult males in full alternate plumage, but these males also tend to be dominant (Wishart 1983; see also West et al. 1981, for Brown-headed Cowbirds,",19a8db3a7adaeaaf2ad1999cf9836bf1cdf60cf5,,0

In many animals immunity is not fully developed until adulthood but the young still need protection against various sets of pathogens. Thus, bird nestlings are highly dependent on antibodies received from their mother (in the eggs) during their rapid early growth period. The relationship between maternal immunity and the development of neonates' own immunity has been poorly studied. 2. It has been suggested that immune function plays an important part in mediating resource competition between different life-history traits, e.g. growth and reproduction. Maternal investment of antibodies has potentially permanent effects on offspring phenotype. Thus, the trade-offs between the immune function and other important life-history traits in the offspring will also affect the fitness of the mother. 3. Our supplemental feeding experiment in the magpie Pica pica indicates that the immunoglobulin levels of offspring at hatching are dependent on a mother's nutritional condition. In addition, the amount of maternal immunoglobulins transferred to offspring increases along the laying order within a nest. 4. We also found that at the age of 8-10 days the immunoglobulin production of the offspring has already begun. Furthermore, the maternal immunoglobulin levels of the offspring at hatching were positively related to their immunoglobulin levels on day 10. 5. Maternal immunoglobulins did not significantly affect offspring growth, but there was a negative relationship between self-produced immunoglobulins and growth over the first 10 days, indicating a trade-off between these traits. Nestlings' weight, however, had a positive relationship with immunoglobulin production suggesting that the observed trade-off between growth and immunoglobulin production is due to catch-up growth of nestlings with a low hatching weight. We found that within nests nestlings with higher maternal antibody levels had higher survival rate until day 20, but between nests there was an opposite relationship. 6. Evidently, there is a trade-off, in magpies, between maternal resources, immune function and growth, shaping the evolution of maternal investment in offspring immunity.",1b64e5f306ebe5398c72c295a6463b065848eaeb,,0

We investigated the effects of competition regime on the uptake of different N forms by two hygrophytes, Carex thunbergii and Polygonum criopolitanum, by conducting a hydroponic test of excised roots and an in situ experiment in a subtropical wetland ecosystem. The two species were grown either in monocultures or mixtures with various neighbor densities. Root functional traits and N uptake rates of different N forms were measured. Our results showed that N uptake was mainly determined by N form, rather than species identity. Both species were able to use organic N sources, but they took up relatively more N supplied as NO3- than as NH4+ or glycine, irrespective of competition treatments. Both species preferred NO3- when grown in monoculture, but in the presence of competitors, the preference of fast-growing C. thunbergii persisted while P. criopolitanum acquired more NH4+ and glycine, with stronger responses being observed at the highest neighbor density. The hydroponic test suggested that these divergences in N acquisition between two species might be partially explained by different root functional traits. To be specific, N uptake rates were significantly positively correlated with root N concentration and specific root length, but negatively correlated with root dry matter content. Our results implicated that C. thunbergii has a competitive advantage with relatively more stable N acquisition strategy despite a lower N recovery than P. criopolitanum, whereas P. criopolitanum could avoid competition with C. thunbergii via a better access to organic N sources, partly mediated by competition regimes.",1ca37a2a3ff3da1199d17847f1bca294d50c90e1,,0

https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.14107,Mutualist- and antagonist-mediated selection contribute to trait diversification of flowers,"Flowers are generally short-lived, and they all face a multidimensional challenge because they have to attract mutualists, compel them to vector pollen with minimal investment in rewards, and repel floral enemies during this short time window. Their displays are under complex selection, either consistent or conflicting, to maximize reproductive fitness under heterogeneous environments. The phenological or morphological mismatches between flowers and visitors will influence interspecific competition, resource access, mating success and, ultimately, population and community dynamics. To better understand the effects of the plant visitors on floral traits, it is necessary to determine the functional significance of specific floral traits for the visitors; how plants respond to both mutualists and antagonists through adaptive changes; and to evaluate the net fitness effects of biological mutualisms and antagonism on plants. In this review, we bring together insights from fields as diverse as floral biology, insect behavioral responses, and evolutionary biology to explain the processes and patterns of floral diversity evolution. Then, we discuss the ecological significance of plant responses to mutualists and antagonists from a community perspective, and propose a set of research questions that can guide the research field to integrate studies of plant defense and reproduction.",1da7e68d31be999c2736648eef01200dc5141cb0,,0

At Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we compiled the first food web quantifying trophic interactions between the majority of co‐occurring woody plant species and their internally feeding insect seed predators. Our study is based on more than 200 000 fruits representing 478 plant species, associated with 369 insect species. Insect host‐specificity was remarkably high: only 20% of seed predator species were associated with more than one plant species, while each tree species experienced seed predation from a median of two insect species. Phylogeny, but not plant traits, explained patterns of seed predator attack. These data suggest that seed predators are unlikely to mediate indirect interactions such as apparent competition between plant species, but are consistent with their proposed contribution to maintaining plant diversity via the Janzen–Connell mechanism.",1fd1ee06e9389ee30027956060f31f282331df01,,0

Condition-specific competition, wherein competitive superiority varies with the abiotic environmental gradient, has been proposed as the major structuring force behind such distributions. However, few studies have elucidated the underlying mechanisms, such as behavioral and demographic processes. We conducted laboratory experiments to examine the effects of temperature on interspecific competition between two stream salmonid fishes, Salvelinus malma and S. leucomaenis. The two species have a largely allopatric altitudinal distribution on Hokkaido Island, Japan, proposed to be the result of temperature-mediated competition. We tested predictions that at a higher temperature (12°C), S. leucomaenis would dominate over S. malma in aggressive interactions, foraging performance, growth, and survival, but become subordinate at a lower temperature (6°C). Indeed, S. leucomaenis initiated a greater number of aggressive acts, attained greater food intake and greater growth, and finally excluded S. malma at the higher temperature. Although the two species initiated a similar number of aggressive acts and foraged equally well at the lower temperature, S. leucomaenis achieved a higher growth rate than S. malma; however, the latter eventually became numerically dominant. Clear competitive release in allopatry occurred for S. malma only at the higher temperature, providing direct evidence of condition-specific asymmetric competition. The lower distribution boundary of S. malma in Hokkaido streams may therefore be determined by temperature-mediated condition-specific competition. However, mechanisms determining the upper distribution boundary of S. leucomaenis could not be fully explained by the competitive results at lower temperature, but required an understanding of how effects of competition interacted with species-specific physiological traits. Thus, species distributions along an environmental gradient cannot be solely explained by a simple model of condition-specific competition without considering mechanistic linkages among behavioral and physiological responses to the environment, resource use, and demographic processes.",209bb24d4917978a92c1d3e36821899959b33359,,0

https://doi.org/10.1890/07-0659.1,Geographic variation in resource dominance-discovery in Brazilian ant communities.,"A predictive framework for the ecology of species invasions requires that we learn what limits successful invaders in their native range. The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) is invasive in the United States, Puerto Rico, Australia, New Zealand, and China. Solenopsis invicta appears to be a superior competitor in its introduced range, where it can cause the local extirpation of native species, but little is known about its competitive ability in its native range in South America. Here we examine the competitive ability of S. invicta for food resources in three widely separated Brazilian ant communities. Each of these communities contains 20-40 ant species, 8-10 of which were common and frequently interacted with S. invicta. S. invicta at all three sites was attacked by several species-specific phorid parasitoids, and at one site, two other species were attacked by their own specialized parasitoids. We examined interactions in these local communities for evidence that trade-offs among ant species between resource dominance and resource discovery, and between resource dominance and parasitoid vulnerability facilitate local coexistence. The trade-off between resource dominance and resource discovery was strong and significant only at Santa Genebra, where parasitoids had no effect on the outcome of confrontations at resources. At Bonito, parasitoids significantly reduced the ability of S. invicta, which was the top-ranked behavioral dominant, from defending and usurping food resources from subordinate species. In the Pantanal, S. invicta ranked behind three other ant species in a linear hierarchy of behavioral dominance, and lost the majority of its interactions with a fourth more subordinate species, Paratrechina fulva, another invasive species. Parasitoids of S. invicta were uncommon in the Pantanal, and did not affect its low position in the hierarchy relative to the other two sites. Parasitoids, however, did affect the ability of Linepithema angulatum, the top-ranked behavioral dominant in this community, from defending and usurping resources from behavioral subordinates. These results indicate that both interspecific competition and trait-mediated indirect effects of phorid parasitoids affect the ecological success of the red imported fire ant in its native range, but that the relative importance of these factors varies geographically.",2109beac1cc60e4fcf44de53f76d9a6dddba501d,,0

To guide effective conservation policies, it is essential to understand the relationship between species diversity and carbon storage in this unique ecosystem. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the response of aboveground carbon (AGC) to species and functional diversity and their effects on AGC in the Yayu Coffee Forest Biosphere Reserve (YCFBR). Using different plot sizes, we collected vegetation data from the core, buffer, and transitional zones of the reserve. We selected traits related to plant‐life strategy, competition ability, response to disturbances, and climate change. Structural equation models (SEMs) were employed to assess the effects of species diversity, functional diversity, and functional dominance on AGC. Data analysis was conducted using R software. Our results revealed that the effects of species richness on AGC were mediated through functional diversity and functional dominance, as demonstrated by both the full mediation and partial mediation models. This suggests that the selection effects and niche complementarity are mutually exclusive yet equally important for predicting AGC. The findings further indicate that functional diversity and functional dominance together accounted for significant predictors of the AGC by 21% in the YCFBR. From a practical standpoint, findings highlight the importance of conserving species diversity as a means to maintain higher AGC in the tropical moist Afromontane forests. In conclusion, this research significantly contributes to the scientific literature by providing valuable insights into the complex relationship between species diversity and carbon storage. The results emphasize the crucial role of functional diversity and dominance in predicting AGC, underscoring the importance of biodiversity conservation for climate mitigation efforts. These findings have practical implications for the development of effective conservation policies tailored to protect and sustain the carbon storage potential of this unique ecosystem.",22abec31a313ba9e3afc571f6bab5b8c1ec882c8,,0

We investigated the role of specificity, relative virulence and relative dose in determining the competitive outcome of multiple infections in the Daphnia magna-Pasteuria ramosa host-parasite system. We found that infections by P. ramosa clones (single genotype) were less virulent and produced more spores than infections by P. ramosa isolates (possibly containing multiple genotypes). We also found that two similarly virulent isolates of P. ramosa differed considerably in their within-host competitiveness and their effects on host offspring production when faced with coinfecting P. ramosa isolates and clones. Although the relative virulence of a P. ramosa isolate/clone appears to be a good indicator of its competitiveness during multiple infections, the relative dose may alter the competitive outcome. Moreover, spore counts on day 20 post-infection indicate that the competitive outcome is largely decided early in the parasite’s growth phase, possibly mediated by direct interference or apparent competition. Our results emphasize the importance of epidemiology as well as of various parasite traits in determining the outcome of within-host competition. Incorporating realistic epidemiological and ecological conditions when testing theoretical models of multiple infections, as well as using a wider range of host and parasite genotypes, will enable us to better understand the course of virulence evolution.",24cc633eb47602c5477a4142c6e0d8228909698c,,0

https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13487,"Sexual dimorphism driven by intersexual resource competition: Why is it rare, and where to look for it?","Abstract Sexes often differ more obviously in secondary sexual characteristics than in traits that appear naturally selected, despite conceivable benefits to intersexual niche partitioning. Genetic constraints may play a role in limiting sex‐specific niche evolution; however, it is not clear why this limit should apply to naturally selected traits more than those under sexual selection; the latter routinely produces dimorphism. We ask whether ecological factors and/or features of the mating system limit dimorphism in resource use, or conversely, what conditions are the most permissible ones for sexual niche differences. The scale of mating competition and spatial variation in resource availability can help predict sexually dimorphic niches or the lack thereof. We investigate why and when dimorphism might fail to evolve even if genetic covariation between the sexes posed no constraint. Our analytical model incorporates the first aspect of spatial interactions (scale of mating competition). It is followed by simulations that explore broader conditions, including multiple resources with habitat heterogeneity, genetic correlations and non‐Gaussian resource‐use efficiency functions. We recover earlier known conditions for favourable conditions for the evolution of niche partitioning between sexes, such as narrow individual niche and low degrees of genetic constraint. We also show spatial considerations to alter this picture. Sexual niche divergence occurs more readily when local mating groups are small and different resources occur reliably across habitats. Polygyny (medium‐sized or large mating groups) can diminish the prospects for dimorphism even if no genetic constraints are present. Habitat heterogeneity typically also disfavours niche dimorphism but can also lead to polymorphism within a sex, if it is beneficial to specialize to be very competitive in one habitat, even at a cost to performance in the other. Sexual conflict is usually used to explain dimorphic traits or behaviours. Our models highlight that introducing conflict (achieved by switching from monogamy to polygamy) can also be responsible for sexual monomorphism. Under monogamy, males benefit from specializing to consume other resources than what feeds the female best. Polygyny makes males disregard this female benefit, and both sexes compete for the most profitable resource, leading to overlapping niches.",26080d5c546081ccb8a59f012f5435b4053c9eb4,,0

Here we have investigated the genetic (AFLP) and morphological (geometric morphometrics) aspects of the littoral–pelagic axis, a commonly observed resource polymorphism in freshwater fishes of postglacial lakes. We found a large degree of variation in the genetic and morphological divergence between littoral and pelagic perch and roach across Swedish lakes. Although there was evidence of assortative mating (elevated kinship values) in both species, we could not find any significant coupling of morphology and genetic divergence. Instead, there was evidence that the extent of resource polymorphism may be largely caused by phenotypic plasticity. These results suggest that assortative mating, which can lead to genetically determined adaptive divergence, does occur in these species, particularly perch, but not according to genetically fixed morphological traits. The behavioural mechanisms facilitating associative mating need to be investigated to explore the interaction between phenotypic plasticity and adaptive genetic divergence and their roles in diversification. © 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015, 114, 929–940.",26a2297bbb45fcefa48d3f633662f6b0acd23a55,,0

Resource availability is a particularly dynamic and potent environmental driver of within-host infection dynamics (temporal patterns of growth, reproduction, parasite production and survival). We developed, parameterised and validated a model for resource-explicit infection dynamics by incorporating a parasitism module into dynamic energy budget theory. The model mechanistically explained the dynamic multivariate responses of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni and its intermediate host snail to variation in resources and host density. At the population level, feedbacks mediated by resource competition could create a unimodal relationship between snail density and human risk of exposure to schistosomes. Consequently, weak snail control could backfire if reductions in snail density release remaining hosts from resource competition. If resource competition is strong and relevant to schistosome production in nature, it could inform control strategies.",26b3209ee5d397c426ab238a824088614e1f3de5,,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.13746,Competitive interactions affect introgression and population viability amidst maladaptive hybridization,"The deliberate release of captive‐bred individuals, the accidental escape of domesticated strains, or the invasion of closely related conspecifics into wild populations can all lead to introgressive hybridization, which poses a challenge for conservation and wildlife management. Rates of introgression and the magnitude of associated demographic impacts vary widely across ecological contexts. However, the reasons for this variation remain poorly understood. One rarely considered phenomenon in this context is soft selection, wherein relative trait values determine success in intraspecific competition for a limiting resource. Here we develop an eco‐genetic model explicitly focussed on understanding the influence of such competitive interactions on the eco‐evolutionary dynamics of wild populations experiencing an influx of foreign/domesticated individuals. The model is applicable to any taxon that experiences natural or human‐mediated inputs of locally maladapted genotypes (‘intrusion’), in addition to phenotype‐dependent competition for a limiting resource (e.g. breeding sites, feeding territories). The effects of both acute and chronic intrusion depended strongly on the relative competitiveness of intruders versus locals. When intruders were competitively inferior, density‐dependent regulation limited their reproductive success (ability to compete for limited spawning sites), which prevented strong introgression or population declines from occurring. In contrast, when intruders were competitively superior, this amplified introgression and led to increased maladaptation of the admixed population. This had negative consequences for population size and population viability. The results were sensitive to the intrusion level, the magnitude of reproductive excess, trait heritability and the extent to which intruders were maladapted relative to locals. Our findings draw attention to under‐appreciated interactions between phenotype‐dependent competitive interactions and maladaptive hybridization, which may be critical to determining the impact captive breeding programmes and domesticated escapees can have on otherwise self‐sustaining wild populations.",26d2ebe06be830fb622c83a09b21bef76271feae,,0

Here, we investigate the relevance of consumer trait variation for species coexistence in a ciliate consumer–microalgal prey system under fluctuating regimes of resource supply. We focus on consumer competition and feeding traits, and specifically on the consumer's ability to overcome periods of resource limitation by mixotrophy, that is, the ability of photosynthetic carbon fixation via algal symbionts in addition to phagotrophy. In a 48‐day chemostat experiment, we investigated competitive interactions of different heterotrophic and mixotrophic ciliates of the genera Euplotes and Coleps under different resource regimes, providing prey either continuously or in pulses under constant or fluctuating light, entailing periods of resource depletion in fluctuating environments, but overall providing the same amount of prey and light. Although ultimate competition results remained unaffected, population dynamics of mixotrophic and heterotrophic ciliates were significantly altered by resource supply mode. However, the effects differed among species combinations and changed over time. Whether mixotrophs or heterotrophs dominated in competition strongly depended on the genera of the competing species and thus, species‐specific differences in the minimum resource requirements that are associated with feeding on shared prey, nutrient uptake, light harvesting, and access to additional resources such as bacteria. Potential differences in the curvature of the species' resource‐dependent growth functions may have further mediated the species‐specific responses to the different resource supply modes. Overall, our study demonstrates that genus‐ or species‐specific traits other than that related to nutritional mode may override the relevance of acquired phototrophy by heterotrophs in competitive interactions, and that the potential advantage of photosynthetic carbon fixation of symbiont‐bearing mixotrophs in competition with pure heterotrophs may differ greatly among different mixotrophs, playing out under different environmental conditions and depending on the specific requirements of the species. Complex trophic interactions determine the outcome of competition, which can only be understood by taking on a multidimensional trait perspective.",283cf8989c67d0c0c4e81a1f19e954fe939f24af,,0

Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) inhabiting stream reaches with different predation regimes have rapidly evolved divergent life history traits. Here, we investigated the effects of both predation and resource availability on guppy trophic niches by evaluating their gut contents, resource standing stocks, and δ15N and δ13C stable isotopes across five streams during the wet season. We found that guppies from low predation (LP) sites had a consistently higher trophic position and proportion of invertebrates in their guts and assimilate less epilithon than guppies from high predation (HP) sites. Higher trophic position was also associated with lower benthic invertebrate availability. Our results suggest that LP guppies could be more efficient invertebrate consumers, possibly as an evolutionary response to greater intraspecific competition for higher quality food. This may be intensified by seasonality, as wet season conditions can alter resource availability, feeding rates, and the intensity of intraspecific competition. Understanding how guppy diets vary among communities is critical to elucidating the role of niche shifts in mediating the link between environmental change and the evolution of life histories.",2b6e7fade1df25e10afca55a0fc82a25c957d0db,,0

Higher-order ecological effects beyond pairwise interactions may be key to complex ecosystems, but mechanisms to produce these effects remain poorly understood. Here we model microbial growth and competition to show that higher-order effects can arise from variation in multiple microbial growth traits, such as lag times and growth rates, on a single limiting resource with no other interactions. These effects produce a range of ecological phenomena: an unlimited number of strains can exhibit multistability and neutral coexistence, potentially with a single keystone strain; strains that coexist in pairs do not coexist all together; and a strain that wins all pairwise competitions can go extinct in a mixed competition. Since variation in multiple growth traits is ubiquitous in microbial populations, our results indicate these higher-order effects may also be widespread, especially in laboratory ecology and evolution experiments.Higher-order interactions occur when one species mediates the interaction between two others. Here, the authors model microbial growth and competition to show that higher-order interactions can arise from tradeoffs in growth traits, leading to neutral coexistence and other complex dynamics.",2c00165cc717678ca3cfa47016791380206e1a60,,0

The investigation moves from a double perspective: on the one hand, highlighting how the notion of theatricality is at the basis of the photographic device, and on the other, underlining how theatre photography is characterised by a substantial ambiguity which calls into question its testimonial value. The two perspectives of investigation are developed starting from examples taken from the European scene, highlighting how, depending on the context, photography and theatre play a role of mutual modelisation, and focusing on photographic portraits of actors, both private and on stage, through some emblematic cases, such as Tommaso Salvini, Sarah Bern-hardt, Eleonora Duse, Henry Irving. sources (two portraits, some a caricature) be Schiller’s Stuarda Ristori. identification that the used to build the scenic image the allowed to precisely trace the portrait that inspired the figurative conception of being born into a family of actors.

Her portraits in carte de visite format quickly integrat-ed into the circuit of the press, establishing a complex relationship with pre-existing graphic techniques, such as engraving. The article analyses the progressive diffusion of Adelaide Ristori’s photographs, focusing in particular on the carte de visite format and on newspapers. The corpus includes three photographs of the actress kept at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France (BNF): a portrait by August Bertsch and two cartes de visite by André Adolphe Eugène Disdéri and Étienne Carjat.

The Cuocolo Collection, housed at the Museo Nazionale di San Martino in Naples, is an extraordinary photographic collection, dedicated exclusively to the world of popular theater in Naples in the nineteenth century and especially at the Teatro San Carlino. The essay intends to reconstruct the historical-theatrical events of the Collection, full of eighty-nine shots between portraits and ensemble scenes, and deepen its historical-spectacular meanings. The study is dedicated to this theatre in photographic form, an iconographic finding of exceptional value until now lacking an adequate scientific investigation, continuously subjected to its progressive reduc-tion to fetish. and then more a careful witness of his time, this photographer was indeed able to tell, like no other, the Italian theater scene through the images of its protagonists. The essay analyses the close relationship established by the three major photographic studios active in Genoa between the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century with the intellectual and artistic environment, in particular with the theatrical world, both locally and nationally. Starting from a systematic analysis of the cultural and society chronicles published in the newspapers, and com-paring the information found with the photographs preserved in the main city and national photographic collections and with the photomechanical reproductions in contemporary publications, an attempt was made to recompose and date the images relating to the opera and dramaturgy produced by the Genoese studios. Despite the sharing of the communication strategy based on the systematic presence in the media and on the often instrumental alliance with the entertainment world, the photographers considered here express themselves with different styles. Among them, the Sciutto photographic studio comes out for quality and awareness, especially with the portraits of Eleonora Duse, memorable for the author and the actress. Finally, light is shed on the influence exerted by the theatrical performances on the taste of the bour-geoisie and on the contamination with the photographic portrait. What is dance photography? How was it born? How does it develop? How can we study it? Articulated around these questions, this contribution aims at identifying a field and a methodology of study, as well as tracing through some emblematic examples the genesis of an expressive language. Different from the portrait of the dancers and from stage photography, dance photography is configured at the crossroads between different genres such as the nude, the shooting of movement, the staged photography, the tableau vivant . From these visual traditions it takes on the techniques and prob-lems and relaunches them in terms of the relationship between still image and expressive body, which provides new answers to questions stratified over time and history. the 1910 special issue of «Scena illustrata»: this publication is considered in the context of the editorial history of the magazine as well as in that of the relation between dance and press in Italy at the turn of the century. The cultural phenomenon of illustrated press that characterizes the passage between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries determines, even in theatrical field, a real explosion of specialized periodicals, in which the novelty of stage photography finds space immediately, as well as the other types of images linked to the performing arts, fueling a specific market and a progressive specialization of professional photographers. At the same time, however, the nature of the magazine’s material support imposes a new visual dynamic and a different relationship with the reader/spectator. In this context, the article focuses on the Parisian newspaper «Comoedia» (1907-1937), and more particularly on the emblematic case of Ernesto Brod, a photographer now com-pletely forgotten, and of whom very little biographical information remains, but who is instead very active as a photographer, as well as a caricaturist, on the pages of the journal during the first quarter of the twentieth century. His photographic production, apparently amateur and with a lower profile than that of other more renowned photographers, represents instead an example of adaptation to a broader strategy of mediatization of the theatrical event, in which photography plays a fundamental func-tion as a tool for interaction and sociability with the audience. prima This section brings together the files of some of the most important Italian archives where valuable documentation on theatre photography is preserved: indispensable places for research, repositories of a precious collective memory. The detailed descrip-tion of the fonds and archives of these institutions should remind us how important it is to continue to preserve, protect and promote the object of photography, which is often neglected and not ‘treated’, i.e. protected and catalogued, as it should be for the benefit of the History of the Performing Arts and studies on the art of photography. artistic, literary, musical and spectacular typologies to convey the ambitions of the Sena-torial aristocracy of Felsina.

On 24 January 1724, the Veronese set designer Innocente Bellavite signed a contract with the impresario Antonio Madonis to create the sets for the operas at the Teatro Sant’Angelo in the 1724-1725 season. The contract, broken by when he entered the pay of Antonio Denzio’s company in Bohemia, is a rare testimony of the clauses established between a set designer and an impresario in Venetian theatres at that time.

Asynarchus larvae pre- dominate in temporary wetlands and are aggressive intraguild predators on Limnephilus larvae, which only predominate in permanent basins with salamanders. We first conducted a field experiment in mesocosms (cattle tanks) to quantify the predatory effects of different life stages of salamanders on the two caddisfly species. Two life stages of the salamanders (larvae and paedomorphs) preferentially preyed on Asynarchus relative to Limnephilus. Subsequent laboratory experiments revealed that high Asynarchus activity rates and rela- tively ineffective antipredatory behaviors led to higher salamander detection and attack rates compared to Limnephilus. In a second field experiment (full factorial for presence and absence of each of the three species), we found that salamander predation on Asynarchus had an indirect positive effect on Limnephilus: survival was higher in the presence of salamanders + Asynarchus than with just Asynarchus. In the laboratory we compared the predatory effects of salamanders with and without their mouths sewn shut and found the observed indirect positive effect on Limnephilus survival to be mainly the result of reduced numbers of Asynarchus rather than salamander-induced changes in Asynarchus behavior. We argue that indirect effects of predator-predator interactions on shared prey will be mainly density-mediated and not trait-mediated when one of the predators (in this case, Asynarchus) is under strong selection for rapid growth and therefore does not modify foraging behaviors in response to the other predator. The reciprocal dominance of Lim- nephilus and Asynarchus in habitats with and without salamanders probably reflects a trade- off between competitive superiority and vulnerability to predation. The high activity levels and aggressiveness that enable Asynarchus to complete development in temporary habitats result in strong asymmetric competition (via intraguild predation) with Limnephilus. In permanent habitats these same behaviors increase Asynarchus vulnerability to salamander predation, which indirectly benefits Limnephilus. This and previous work implicate sala- manders as keystone predators that exert a major influence on the composition of benthic and planktonic assemblages in subalpine wetlands.",2cd76c19c7b9f9783efb8239b9c38f350bf8dbbb,,0

In aquatic systems, nutrient-mediated eutrophication has led to major declines in species diversity, motivating us to seek terrestrial analogues using a large-mammal system across 598 000 km2 of the Canadian boreal forest. These forests are undergoing some of the most rapid rates of land-use change on Earth and are home to declining caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations. Using satellite-derived estimates of primary productivity, coupled with estimates of moose (Alces alces) and wolf (Canis lupus) abundance, we used path analyses to discriminate among hypotheses explaining how habitat alteration can affect caribou population growth. Hypotheses included food limitation, resource dominance by moose over caribou, and apparent competition with predators shared between moose and caribou. Results support apparent competition and yield estimates of wolf densities (1.8 individuals 1000 km−2) above which caribou populations decline. Our multi-trophic analysis provides insight into the cascading effects of habitat alteration from forest cutting that destabilize terrestrial predator–prey dynamics. Finally, the path analysis highlights why conservation actions directed at the proximate cause of caribou decline have been more successful in the near term than those directed further along the trophic chain.",2eb292d5549e1aa6b1a5d59e71a8d5fda358326a,,0
https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.02.074146,Close encounters of the three morphs: does color affect aggression in a polymorphic lizard?,"Color polymorphism is genetically controlled and the process generating and maintaining morphs can affect speciation and/or extinction rates. Competition and aggression among morphs can contribute to polymorphism maintenance and color badges are useful signals in intraspecific communication, because they convey information about alternative strategies and avoid unnecessary conflicts. This could lead to an uneven spatial distribution of morphs in a population, because the local frequency of each morph establishes the intensity of the competition in that neighborhood, and then the fitness of each male. We used a polymorphic lizard, Podarcis muralis, to assess if aggression varies among morphs under two contrasting hypotheses: a heteromorphic vs. a homomorphic aggression. We used laboratory mirror tests after lizard color manipulation and we verified the results consistency with the analysis of the spatial distribution of morphs in a wild population. Both the experiments confirmed that aggression is morph-specific and notably homomorphic. The adoption of behavioral alternative strategies that minimize risks and costs of unwanted conflicts could facilitate the stable coexistence of the phenotypes and reduce the resource competition. A bias in aggression to like-coloured males would advantage rarer morph, which would suffer less harassment by common morphs and obtain a fitness advantage. This process would be negatively-frequency-dependent and would stabilize polymorphism in the populations, possibly leading to sympatric speciation.",2f38dcf02d539b98631caf4e327260ff376e1f85,,0
https://doi.org/10.3390/d17020108,Ecological Traits and Intraguild Competition Mediate Spatial and Temporal Overlaps Among Sympatric Mesocarnivores,"In terrestrial mammalian carnivore guilds, interspecific competitions (interferences and resource competitions) among sympatric species induce their ecological and behavioral patterns and population dynamics, thereby shaping community structures. Competitive species must partition their ecological niches for sympatry, while the extent of niche overlaps is mediated by either the ecological traits (e.g., body size differences) or environmental features. We aimed to elucidate the patterns of spatial and temporal niche overlaps in mesocarnivore guilds, which are mediated by their ecological traits, regional environments, and anthropogenic disturbances. We investigated the spatial occurrence and diel activities of six mesocarnivore species and estimated their spatial and temporal overlap indices in various landscapes with different anthropogenic disturbances in central Bulgaria. Statistical modeling demonstrated that spatial overlap among mesocarnivores declined when mesocarnivore pairs were within the same family and when large carnivores (particularly wolves, Canis lupus) were present. Furthermore, we found that the extent of their temporal overlaps was associated with taxonomic and body size differences in mesocarnivore pairs as well as their trophic competitions. Our findings indicated that the intensity of interferences among mesocarnivore species was key for the decline of spatial or temporal niche overlap to relax antagonistic interactions.",3003361b35e6ec7695f569a88a2848e7f2de1a17,,0
https://doi.org/10.1137/22m1503099,Similarity Suppresses Cyclicity: Why Similar Competitors Form Hierarchies,"Competitive systems can exhibit both hierarchical (transitive) and cyclic (intransitive) structures. Despite theoretical interest in cyclic competition, which offers richer dynamics, and occupies a larger subset of the space of possible competitive systems, most real-world systems are predominantly transitive. Why? Here, we introduce a generic mechanism which promotes transitivity, even when there is ample room for cyclicity. Consider a competitive system where outcomes are mediated by competitor attributes via a performance function. We demonstrate that, if competitive outcomes depend smoothly on competitor attributes, then similar competitors compete transitively. We quantify the rate of convergence to transitivity given the similarity of the competitors and the smoothness of the performance function. Thus, we prove the adage regarding apples and oranges. Similar objects admit well ordered comparisons. Diverse objects may not. To test that theory, we run a series of evolution experiments designed to mimic genetic training algorithms. We consider a series of canonical bimatrix games and an ensemble of random performance functions that demonstrate the generality of our mechanism, even when faced with highly cyclic games. We vary the training parameters controlling the evolution process, and the shape parameters controlling the performance function, to evaluate the robustness of our results. These experiments illustrate that, if competitors evolve to optimize performance, then their traits may converge, leading to transitivity.",3016ded0bb37b5feef5ee05682bd6aa49c9445dc,,0

https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.994319,A novel framework for modeling the evolution of cross-scale ecological assembly,"Community assembly can be driven by species’ responses to environmental gradients, and interactions within (e.g., competition) and across (e.g., herbivory) clades. These ecological dynamics are mediated by species’ traits, which are in turn shaped by past evolution. As such, identifying the drivers of species assembly is made difficult by the differing temporal and spatial scales of ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Two recent advances have emerged to address the cross-scale challenge of modeling species assembly: phylogenetic generalized linear mixed modeling (PGLMM) and earth observation networks (EONs). PGLMM integrates through time by modeling the evolution of trait-based community assembly, while EONs synthesize across space by placing standardized site-level species occurrence data within their regional context. Here we describe a framework for combining these tools to investigate the drivers of species assembly, and so address three outstanding questions: (1) Does evolution adapt or constrain regional-scale environmental responses? (2) Do evolved responses to past competition minimize or enhance present-day competition? (3) Are species’ cross-clade associations evolutionarily constrained? We provide a conceptual overview of how PGLMM and EONs can be synthesized to answer these questions, and provide exemplar Bayesian PGLMM code. Finally, we describe the capacity of these tools to aid in conservation and natural resource management, including predicting future colonization by rare and invasive species, vulnerable mutualisms, and pest and pathogen outbreaks.",30a5434a0166c080f57220ada8311ef09fe3e47d,,0

https://doi.org/10.1111/1749-4877.12543,Palatability and profitability of co-occurring seeds alter indirect interactions among rodent-dispersed trees.,"Beyond direct species interactions, seed dispersal is potentially affected by indirect seed-seed interactions among co-occurring nut-bearing trees which are mediated by scatter-hoarding animals as shared seed dispersers. A relevant question in such systems is to what extent different functional traits related to food palatability and profitability affect the kinds of indirect interactions that occur among co-occurring seeds, and the consequences for seed dispersal. We used field experiments to track seed dispersal with individually-tagged seeds in both monospecific and mixed seed communities. We measured indirect effects based on three seed-seed species pairs from the Family Fagaceae with contrasting seed size, tannin level, and dormancy in a subtropical forest in Southwest China. When all else was equal, the presence of adjacently-placed seeds with contrasting seed traits created different indirect effects measured through a variety of dispersal-related indicators. Apparent mutualism was reciprocal due to increasing seed dispersal in mixed seed patches with mixed differences in seed tannins and dormancy. However, differences in either seed size or dormancy in co-occurring adjacently placed seeds caused apparent competition with reduced seed removal or seed dispersal (distance) in at least one species. Our study supports the hypothesis that different functional traits related to food palatability and profitability in co-occurring seeds modify foraging decisions of scatter-hoarding animals, and subsequently cause indirect effects on seed dispersal among rodent-dispersed trees. We conclude that such indirect effects mediated by shared seed dispersers may act as an important determinant of seed dispersal for co-fruiting animal-dispersed trees in many natural forests.

https://doi.org/10.1086/408437,"The Comparative Evolutionary Biology of the Sibling Species, Drosophila melanogaster and D. Simulans","1. D. melanogaster and D. simulans are sibling species; they are morphologically almost identical and genetically very similar. Whereas their sexual behavior patterns are qualitatively similar, hybrids are rarely produced and when they are, they are sterile. 2. Although not all data are in agreement, D. melanogaster generally exhibits more chromosomal, enzyme, and protein polymorphism than does D. simulans. Utilizin this relationship, as well as arguments presented in the literature, one can argue for an association between genetic variability and level of ecological heterogeneity. This association is found for two major environmental variables, temperature and light dependence. 3. On a seasonal basis, D. melanogaster achieves large population numbers early in the summer, as D. simulans does in the autumn. The ratio of D. melanogaster to D. simulans increases with temperature and more importantly, with temperature fluctuation. Macroenvironmental temperature is an important factor involved in numerical changes within the two species. Both species from Brisbane, Queensland, are genetically heterogeneous for resistance to desiccation, with additive genetic effects and directional dominance for resistance, whereas at Melbourne, Victoria, D. melanogaster is similar, but the genetic architecture of D. simulans is additive only. Desiccation resistance in the D. simulans Melbourne population varies cyclically on an annual basis but not in the other populations-apparently different genotypes are selected differentially at different times of the year. Between-species generalizations, as in (2) above, are therefore made difficult because of variations within species. 4. From collections at a vineyard and maturation wine cellar coupled with subsequent laboratory experiments, it is clear that an environment in which D. melanogaster occurs exclusive of D. simulans is one of an alcohol-associated resource. On the other hand, in certain places D. simulans has displaced D. melanogaster, for reasons as yet unknown. 5. In the laboratory, a number of experiments at the intraspecific and interspecific levels show differences in fitness-associated traits, such as viability at different stages of the life cycle, oviposition sites, and pupation sites. The results are difficult to interpret, often being dependent upon strain, temperature, or level of competition. Studies over a series of temperatures assessing fitness parameters for many strains of both species are needed before extrapolation to the natural environment is possible. The same problem occurs when population-cage competition experiments betweeen the two species are considered, although some of these experiments have shown that competition itself is controlled by natural selection. 6. The differences between the two species are, in general, quantitative rather than qualitative, so that, with the exception of alcohol, both species use rather similar environmental resources. The potential for rapid increases in the spring suggests that both species are more r strategists than K strategists. In the wild, while some niches, such as alcohol-associated resources, can be defined, it is imperative to define the resources used in nature in order to achieve a more complete comparative evolutionary biology of the two species. The value of the two species in linking behavior, ecology, and genetics is only just now being realized after over half a century of studying them exclusively in various laboratory containers.",32f6e54727da002c8487406b2f6451d037afe676,,0
https://doi.org/10.14264/7F62E8F,Testing the processes required for coexistence mediated by spatially varying environments,"One of the fundamental questions in community ecology is how diverse biological communities are able persist through time. Ultimately, the maintenance of species diversity is dependent on the relative magnitude of the mechanisms which drive local extinction and those that prevent it. Accordingly, considerable effort has been invested over several decades into understanding where, when and to what extent these mechanisms operate in different ecological systemsHowever, to date, most empirical studies of diversity maintenance have focused on processes occurring at small, environmentally homogenous spatial scales. Nevertheless, theory suggests that spatial variation in the environment occurring at larger spatial scales, a ubiquitous features of natural ecosystems, can interact with differences in species’ ecophysiology to promote coexistence when species’ growth, survival and biotic interactions respond to the spatial environment in different ways. Thus, rather than averaging across spatial variation, there is an imperative to understand whether niche differentiation across spatial heterogeneity can provide the conditions necessary for stable coexistence in biological communities. My thesis advances our understanding of diversity maintenance in natural ecosystems by empirically testing key requirements of the spatial coexistence mechanisms described in Chesson’s modern coexistence theory.The challenge of explaining how diversity is maintained in biological communities is particularly acute for plants which, as primary producers, compete for just a handful of resources including light, soil nutrients and moisture. My thesis utilises field and laboratory experimental studies to investigate key requirements of spatial coexistence in the annual plant understorey of the York gum – jam woodlands, a woodland occurring in southwest Western Australia characterized by an overstorey of York gum (Eucalyptus loxophleba) and jam (Acacia acuminata). In Chapter 1, I review the contribution of the modern coexistence theoretical framework to our present understanding of how diversity is maintained in biological communities, focusing on variation-dependent coexistence mechanisms and in particular the spatial storage effect. I then establish the motivation of my thesis by highlighting important knowledge gaps including, principally, a paucity of empirical studies testing the key requirements of coexistence mediated by spatial variation.Two of the major requirements of the spatial storage effect are that: (1) species have unique vital rate responses to their spatial environment and that, when abundant, (ii) species experience stronger competition in the environmental patches where they perform better (i.e. positive environment-competition covariance). Thus, In Chapter 2, Requirements for the spatial storage effect are weakly evident for common species in natural annual plant assemblages, I use a neighbour removal experiment in ambiently-occurring annual plant assemblages to test how 11 focal species’ fecundity in the presence and absence of competition varies across a variety of measurable environmental gradients. Species-specific fecundity responses to the environment were not strongly apparent but were found for five out of eleven focal species. In addition, despite finding strong evidence for intra-specific competition for the majority of focal species, positive covariance between the favourability of the environment and the strength of competition was only found for one species. My findings suggest that positive environment-competition covariance may not be as common as expected for abundant species, indicating that coexistence in the York gum – jam woodlands annual understorey may not be strongly regulated by the spatial storage effect, at least when mediated by fecundity alone.In addition to fecundity, annual plant demography is also strongly regulated by seed bank dynamics. Species-specific differentiation in the rate of dormancy alleviation and germination across spatial gradients may therefore promote coexistence. Thus, in Chapter 3, Variable seed bed microsite conditions and light influence germination in Australian winter annuals, I test the light requirements in vitro of seeds for twelve focal species buried for seven months in seed banks across two orthogonal environmental gradients. I hypothesized that the seed bank conditions experienced prior to the arrival of germination-inducing rainfall, the light conditions experienced in vitro and their interaction may differentiate species’ germination niche. I found that six out of the twelve focal species exhibited significant, positive germination responses to light although the magnitude of this response varied among species. Two focal species also exhibited unique germination responses to the amount of canopy cover while in the seed bank, although there was limited evidence that seed bank conditions interacted with light to influence species’ germination response. My findings suggest that species’ germination strategy, determined jointly by environmental cues experienced before and during germination, may be an axis over which niche differentiation occurs across space.In Chapter 4, Trait-mediated demographic responses to spatial heterogeneity are present but weak in a diverse annual plant community, I expand upon the findings from Chapter 2 and 3 by testing whether twelve focal species exhibit unique responses to variation in environmental patch conditions across multiple vital rates and their intrinsic growth rate in the absence of biotic interactions. To do this, I conducted a sowing experiment to test species’ responses in common gardens across environmental gradients known to influence community turnover in the York gum woodlands.  I then use the relative light requirements for germination observed in Chapter 3, among other seed and vegetative functional traits, to test whether species’ ecophysiological strategies predict the strength and magnitude of their environmental responses. Ultimately, I found limited evidence for species-specific responses to the environment, but this depended on the vital rate being investigated and whether I used an approach which implicitly or explicitly accounted for measurable gradients in the abiotic environment. The ability of functional traits to predict species’ demographic responses depended on the vital rate and the environmental gradient, but I found that the magnitude of the change in species’ probability of survival along a gradient of soil fertility was dependent on species’ position along multiple trait axes. In addition, variation in species’ intrinsic growth rate responses to soil fertility were significantly predicted by their position along a trade-off axis between high specific leaf area and high leaf dry matter content. My findings demonstrate that species’ intrinsic demographic responses to spatial heterogeneity are relatively weak which suggests that there is limited opportunity for coexistence via fluctuation-dependent mechanisms in this system. Despite limited variation in species’ demographic responses to the environment, however, I demonstrate that functional traits are a useful tool for predicting species’ fitness across spatially heterogenous landscapes. In Chapter 5, I reflect upon Chapters 2-4 by first discussing the contribution of my research to our understanding of the necessary prerequisites for coexistence in spatially varying environments. Based on my findings, I then propose a series of future research questions and elaborate on how these questions may be addressed.",337d8de8a12e8ff1bd74c25022c9256aba3ee9fd,,0
https://doi.org/10.5194/BGD-11-13157-2014,Testing functional trait-based mechanisms underpinning plant responses to grazing and linkages to ecosystem functioning in grasslands,"Abstract. Abundant evidence has shown that grazing alters plant functional traits, ecological strategies, community structure, and ecosystem functioning of grasslands. Few studies, however, have examined how plant responses to grazing are mediated by resource availability and functional group identity. We test functional trait-based mechanisms underlying the responses of different life forms to grazing and linkages to ecosystem functioning along a soil moisture gradient in the Inner Mongolia grassland. A principal component analysis (PCA) based on 9 traits × 276 species matrix showed that the plant size spectrum (i.e., individual biomass), leaf economics spectrum (leaf N content and leaf density), and light competition spectrum (height and stem-leaf biomass ratio) distinguished plant species responses to grazing. The three life forms exhibited differential strategies as indicated by trait responses to grazing. The annuals and biennials adopted grazing-tolerant strategies associated with high growth rate, reflected by high leaf N content and specific leaf area. The perennial grasses exhibited grazing-tolerant strategies associated with great regrowth capacity and high palatability scores, whereas perennial forbs showed grazing-avoidant strategies with short stature and low palatability scores. In addition, the dominant perennial bunchgrasses exhibited mixed tolerance–resistance strategies to grazing and mixed acquisitive–conservative strategies in resource utilization. Grazing increased the relative abundance of perennial forbs with low palatability in the wet and fertile meadow, but it promoted perennial grasses with high palatability in the dry and infertile typical steppe. Our findings suggest that the effects of grazing on plant functional traits are dependent on both the abiotic (e.g., soil moisture) and biotic (e.g., plant functional group identity and composition) factors. Grazing-induced shifts in functional group composition are largely dependent on resource availability, particularly water availability.",33d43fba848c2a97a0aa18d153721d9f5a1ef52d,,0
https://doi.org/10.1163/156853907779947328,Carotenoid-based plumage coloration and aggression during molt in male house finches,"Summary Birds often use colorful traits to mediate resource competitions, and typically individuals with bright or large patches of color are more competitive than or dominant to those with drab or small color patches. Male House Finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) are an exception, however, as drab males tend to be more aggressive than bright males during the breeding season and in winter. One hypothesis for this ‘negatively correlated handicap’ is that drab male house finches, being comparatively sexually unattractive and in poor health and condition, have more to gain by elevating aggression and increasing access to food and pursuit of (especially extra-pair) mates. It would seem important then to test this hypothesis during the period of molt, when birds are actively acquiring the foods and carotenoid pigments that make them colorful and a time in which there is a clear link between plumage color and nutrition/health in this species. We conducted two captive dominance experiments with male House Finches from the southwestern United States (their native range) to examine the relationship between carotenoid-based plumage coloration and aggression during molt. In the first experiment, where birds exhibited their natural, currently growing plumage color, we found that drab males were significantly more aggressive than bright males. However, when plumage colors were manipulated with art markers in a second experiment, color display was no longer significantly predictive of agonistic outcomes. These results suggest that: (1) drab male dominance is not an artifact in eastern US populations and instead is a conserved property of native and non-native House Finches, (2) like in our previous studies in winter, plumage color is correlated with dominance but does not serve as a visual signal of social status in this species, and (3) drab males should have a competitive advantage over access to important carotenoid-rich foods during molt, but apparently do not become as colorful because they do not adequately locate carotenoid-rich foods or do not use them efficiently for energetic or health reasons, which are perhaps exacerbated by elevated testosterone levels.",346c43aaf985528c038508e7cdf3b8de06e6d8b7,,0

However, few microbial ecological models address this trait, particularly concerning multiple enzyme functional groups that regulate complex biogeochemical processes. Here, we aim to fill this gap by developing a COmpetitive Dynamic Enzyme ALlocation (CODEAL) scheme for six enzyme groups that act as indicators of inorganic nitrogen (N) transformations in the Microbial-ENzyme Decomposition (MEND) model. This allocation scheme employs time-variant allocation coefficients for each enzyme group, fostering mutual competition among the multiple groups. We show that the principle of enzyme cost minimization is achieved by using the substrate’s saturation level as the factor for enzyme allocation, resulting in an enzyme-efficient pathway with minimal enzyme cost per unit metabolic flux. It suggests that the relative substrate availability affects the trade-off between enzyme production and metabolic flux. Our research has the potential to give insights into the nuanced dynamics of the N cycle and inspire the evolving landscape of enzyme-mediated biogeochemical processes in microbial ecological modeling, which is gaining increasing attention.",36b82a6cb9432c6a09c727a4ff606d3e16673c37,,0

The key alteration, relative to the past, is increased competition and predation, especially at juvenile stages, which is likely mediated by more stable flow and resource regimes. A dataset (SONFISHES) assembled by W. L. Minckley and covering 150 years of fish occurrence in the Lower Colorado River (below Glen Canyon Dam) has provided insight into patterns in extirpation among native fishes and range expansion among non-native fishes. Several studies have combined these data with measures of extinction risk to explain how range fragmentation and species’ traits correlate with observed extinctions or threats in native species. Another study analyzed range shifts within a strategy space of potential fish life histories (originally introduced by K. O. Winemiller and K. A. Rose) to understand how human activity has created and removed ecological niches. Together, these studies support a causal link between environmental and faunal change. This strongly suggests that continuing the status quo will result in further extirpation and extinction of native fishes. I argue, however, that current knowledge is not yet sufficient to quantitatively forecast the magnitude and timescale of the response in fish biodiversity to any projected future environment. Such forecasting requires a model that quantitatively relates the environment to persistence in the strategy-space of fish life histories. Unfortunately, we do not need such a model to make the qualitative prediction: threatened “big-river” fishes will eventually go extinct without intervention.",36cfb1b19546e48df9ca93b49ceffb61a794592d,,0

https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139342179.005,Adaptive Dynamics of Speciation: Ecological Underpinnings,"Speciation occurs when a population splits into ecologically differentiated and reproductively isolated lineages. In this chapter, we focus on the ecological side of nonallopatric speciation: Under what ecological conditions is speciation promoted by natural selection? What are the appropriate tools to identify speciation-prone ecological systems? For speciation to occur, a population must have the potential to become polymorphic (i.e., it must harbor heritable variation). Moreover, this variation must be under disruptive selection that favors extreme phenotypes at the cost of intermediate ones. With disruptive selection, a genetic polymorphism can be stable only if selection is frequency dependent (Pimm 1979; see Chapter 3). Some appropriate form of frequency dependence is thus an ecological prerequisite for nonallopatric speciation. Frequency-dependent selection is ubiquitous in nature. It occurs, among many other examples, in the context of resource competition (Christiansen and Loeschcke 1980; see Box 4.1), predator–prey systems (Marrow et al. 1992), multiple habitats (Levene 1953), stochastic environments (Kisdi and Meszena 1993; Chesson 1994), asymmetric competition (Maynard Smith and Brown 1986), mutualistic interactions (Law and Dieckmann 1998), and behavioral conflicts (Maynard Smith and Price 1973; Hofbauer and Sigmund 1990). The theory of adaptive dynamics is a framework devised to model the evolution of continuous traits driven by frequency-dependent selection. It can be applied to various ecological settings and is particularly suitable for incorporating ecological complexity. The adaptive dynamic analysis reveals the course of long-term evolution expected in a given ecological scenario and, in particular, shows whether, and under which conditions, a population is expected to evolve toward a state in which disruptive selection arises and promotes speciation. To achieve analytical tractability in ecologically complex models, many adaptive dynamic models (and much of this chapter) suppress genetic complexity with the assumption of clonally reproducing phenotypes (also referred to as strategies or traits). This enables the efficient identification of interesting features of the engendered selective pressures that deserve further analysis from a genetic perspective.",38075e35e63af30455d6edcab9af03e913e9f501,,0

Biotic relationships can be intra- or interspecific, positive or negative and cover a wide range of interactions, including predation, commensalism, mutualism, competition and parasitism. It is indicated that snake venoms, which are the best studied, attract the greatest attention of researchers. The role of predators in the formation of the structure and functioning of ecosystems is analyzed. It has been established that the predator–prey ecological interaction causes mutual physiological, morphological and behavioral adaptations at the individual, intra- and inter-species levels. It is noted that toxins are important adaptation that arose due to evolution. Representatives of venomous animals are present in every ecosystem, more than 250,000 species of animals use their venom for predation, as well as for defense and survival. Іnformation about the types of poisonous and venomous animals is summarized in the article. The composition of animal venoms and the pathological consequences of their influence are presented. It is noted that the lost of habitats, climate change and biological invasions pose a threat to ecological processes that are associated with the interaction between species. The importance of snakes for ecosystems, their significance for trophic network and regulating pests is highlighted. It was found that from an ecological point of view, snake venom is an important functional trait that mediates biotic interaction between several organisms.

Their ability to colonise them and thrive depends on life‐history traits including fecundity, dormancy and dispersal ability. The effects of these traits on species distribution, abundance and community assembly have been extensively studied in fragmented landscapes. However, their consequences for genetic diversity and connectivity in local populations remain largely unknown. We investigated the genetic population structure and diversity of Curculio elephas and Curculio glandium (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), two sympatric acorn weevils with contrasting life‐history strategies, in a landscape with mature oak stands and plots of new expanding forests. Using a fragment of a mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 and nuclear DNA (80 single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]), we found that gene flow between populations was significantly weaker in the poor disperser C. elephas, especially in isolated new forests. However, genetic neutrality tests did show population expansion in C. elephas, which suffers frequent population bottlenecks (probably linked to extended dormancy) and is a poor coloniser of isolated new forests. However, its greater fecundity allows it to recovery quickly if the number of reproductive individuals falls. Its populations are thus larger but genetically less diverse than those of C. glandium Within foraging guilds, the most fecund species will outcompete the others under a context of constrained dispersal. Hence, new landscapes of expanding forests represent a good opportunity for more mobile but less fecund species to colonise new habitats and so be temporarily released from competition.",3868b5c650f9875429bbf26afb8aa1301300ab72,,0
https://doi.org/10.3120/0024-9637-68.4.406,DO HABITAT SHIFTS ALTER FLOWERING PHENOLOGY OVERLAP IN CLOSE RELATIVES? IMPLICATIONS FOR LOCAL COEXISTENCE,"Abstract Flowering time in plants is a highly variable trait that influences species' resource use and exchange of pollen with con- and heterospecifics. Levin (2009) suggested that habitat shifts within species might cause plastic shifts in flowering phenology, reducing pollen exchange across habitats. Coupled with divergent selection across habitats, diverged flowering time might thus pave the way towards ecological speciation. Some of these ideas may apply across species as well. If close heterospecific relatives share phylogenetically conserved flowering times and negatively affect each other's fitness, habitat shifts to microallopatry might provide a means for local coexistence by close relatives by reducing resource competition, shared enemies, or negative interactions via pollination. Habitat shifts might also select for diverged flowering time, or cause flowering time divergence, if phylogenetically conserved cues arrive at different times across habitats. Here, we ask if flowering phenology is phylogenetically conserved for 208 species at our coastal field site in northern California, whether flowering phenology differs systematically across habitat types, and whether habitat shifts are associated with phenological separation, especially in congeners. Because annuality and perenniality have been shown to be associated with habitat traits and flowering time, we included life history in our analyses as well. We also explore the frequency of habitat shifts between congener and noncongener pairs. We use both field observations and data from Jepson eFlora/Jepson Manual 2 (Baldwin et al. 2012) to explore patterns in flowering phenology. The two data sources were well-correlated across 59 species. Phylogeny, habitat, and life history all influenced flowering time, and habitat and life history were also phylogenetically conserved across 208 spp. Congeners differed in habitat more often than noncongener pairs, and also overlapped more in flowering time. Habitat shifts were not associated with shifts in flowering time in congeners, despite mean peak flowering time differences across habitats, and phylogenetic conservatism in habitat use. Congeners that differed in both habitat use and life history, however, did have the greatest difference in peak flowering dates. Habitat shifts likely play a role in local coexistence of close relatives, but our data do not support habitat-mediated changes in phenology as a possible mechanism. Experimental approaches may elucidate the role of phenology, resource competition, pollinators, and other associates in mediating coexistence of congeners at our coastal California field site.",38e1588b45ff3bda460c93b6effe6136ede84c06,,0
https://doi.org/10.1038/srep24021,Determinants of emigration and their impact on survival during dispersal in fox and jackal populations,"Animals disperse in response to poor resource conditions as a strategy of escaping harsh competition and stress, but may also disperse under good resource conditions, as these provide better chances of surviving dispersal and gaining fitness benefits such as avoiding kin competition and inbreeding. Individual traits should mediate the effect of resources, yielding a complex condition-dependent dispersal response. We investigated how experimental food reductions in a food-rich environment around poultry-growing villages interact with individual-traits (age, gender, body-mass) in two sympatric canids, red foxes and golden jackals, to jointly affect emigration propensity and survival during dispersal. Sub-adult foxes emigrated more frequently from the food-rich habitat than from the pristine, food-limited habitat, while adult foxes showed the opposite trend. During dispersal, adults exhibited lower survival while sub-adults did not experience additional mortality costs. Although fox mortality rates increased in response to food reduction, dispersal remained unchanged, while jackals showed strong dispersal response in two of the three repetitions. Jackal survival under food reduction was lowest for the dispersing individuals. While resources are an important dispersal determinant, different age classes and species experience the same resource environment differently and consequently have different motivations, yielding different dispersal responses and consequences.",38fcf6c1c4e6dbd1ef281434623a21e1bf901c95,,0

Tropical Tree Growth and Its Response to Climate Anomalies Is Mediated by Neighbourhood Hierarchy and Dissimilarity in Carbon‐ and Water‐Related Traits,"ABSTRACT Taxonomic diversity effects on forest productivity and response to climate extremes range from positive to negative, suggesting a key role for complex interactions among neighbouring trees. To elucidate how neutral interactions, hierarchical competition and resource partitioning between neighbours' shape tree growth and climate response in a highly diverse Amazonian forest, we combined 30 years of tree censuses with measurements of water‐ and carbon‐related traits. We modelled individual tree growth response to climate and neighbourhood to disentangle the relative effect of neighbourhood densities, trait hierarchies and dissimilarities. While neighbourhood densities consistently decreased growth, trait dissimilarity increased it, and both had the potential to influence climate response. Greater water conservatism provided a competitive advantage to focal trees in normal years, but water–spender neighbours reduced this effect in dry years. By underlining the importance of density and trait‐mediated neighbourhood interactions, our study offers a way towards improving predictions of forest dynamics.",392407c5f3c35e8063ac9c4b9aaec6a71886de98,,0

Here, various aspects of phenotypic and life-history variation of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L., brown trout Salmo trutta L., and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.) are reviewed. While many strategies and tactics are commonly used by these species, there are also differences in their ecology and population dynamics that result in a variety of interesting and diverse topics that are challenging for future research. Atlantic salmon display considerable phenotypic plasticity and variability in life-history characters ranging from fully freshwater resident forms, where females can mature at approximately 10 cm in length, to anadromous populations characterised by 3–5 sea-winter (5SW) salmon. Even within simple 1SW populations, 20 or more spawning life-history types can be identified. Juveniles in freshwater can use both fluvial and lacustrine habitats for rearing, and while most smolts migrate to sea during the spring, fall migrations occur in some populations. At sea, some salmon undertake extensive oceanic migrations while other populations stay within the geographical confines of areas such as the Baltic Sea. At the other extreme are those that reside in estuaries and return to freshwater to spawn after spending only a few months at sea. The review of information on the diversity of life-history forms is related to conservation aspects associated with Atlantic salmon populations and current trends in abundance and survival. Brown trout is indigenous to Europe, North Africa and western Asia, but was introduced into at least 24 countries outside Europe and now has a world-wide distribution. It exploits both fresh and salt waters for feeding and spawning (brackish), and populations are often partially migratory. One part of the population leaves and feeds elsewhere, while another part stays as residents. In large, complex systems, the species is polymorphic with different size morphs in the various parts of the habitat. Brown trout feed close to the surface and near shore, but large individuals may move far offshore. The species exhibits ontogenetic niche shifts partly related to size and partly to developmental rate. They switch when the amount of surplus energy available for growth becomes small with fast growers being younger and smaller fish than slow growers. Brown trout is an opportunistic carnivore, but individuals specialise at least temporarily on particular food items; insect larvae are important for the young in streams, while littoral epibenthos in lakes and fish are most important for large trout. The sexes differ in resource use and size. Females are more inclined than males to become migratory and feed in pelagic waters. Males exploit running water, near-shore and surface waters more than females. Therefore, females feed more on zooplankton and exhibit a more uniform phenotype than males. The Arctic charr is the northernmost freshwater fish on earth, with a circumpolar distribution in the Holarctic that matches the last glaciation. Recent mtDNA studies indicate that there are five phylogeographic lineages (Atlantic, Arctic, Bering, Siberian and Acadian) that may be of Pleistocene origin. Phenotypic expression and ecology are more variable in charr than in most fish. Weights at maturation range from 3 g to 12 kg. Population differences in morphology and coloration are large and can have some genetic basis. Charr live in streams, at sea and in all habitats of oligotrophic lakes, including very deep areas. Ontogenetic habitat shifts between lacustrine habitats are common. The charr feed on all major prey types of streams, lakes and near-shore marine habitats, but has high niche flexibility in competition. Cannibalism is expressed in several cases, and can be important for developing and maintaining bimodal size distributions. Anadromy is found in the northern part of its range and involves about 40, but sometimes more days in the sea. All charr overwinter in freshwater. Partial migration is common, but the degree of anadromy varies greatly among populations. The food at sea includes zooplankton and pelagic fish, but also epibenthos. Polymorphism and sympatric morphs are much studied. As a prominent fish of glaciated lakes, charr is an important species for studying ecological speciation by the combination of field studies and experiments, particularly in the fields of morphometric heterochrony and comparative behaviour.",3a07dc17129ec541c9640ee332e90083f2dc5ff4,,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13131,Cascading effects of a top predator on intraspecific competition at intermediate and basal trophic levels,"Handling Editor: Shaun Killen Abstract 1. Predators can impact competition among prey by altering prey density via consumption or by causing prey to modify their traits or foraging behavior. Yet, differences between these two mechanisms may lead to different cascading impacts on lower trophic levels. 2. Using a crab-snail-barnacle rocky intertidal food chain, we tested the effects of predation risk from crabs (top predators) on intraspecific competition among snails (intermediate consumers) and emergent indirect effects on the density of and competition among barnacles (basal resources). 3. The per capita foraging and growth rates of snails declined with high conspecific density. Predation risk from crabs, which caused even larger reductions in snail foraging and growth, weakened competition among snails, whereas a 45% increase in barnacle density had no detectable effect on snail competition. 4. Intraspecific competition between barnacles, however, depended on the interactive effects of barnacle density, snail density, and crab predation risk. Barnacles developed hummocking morphologies as they grew and competed for space. Hummock formation (a proxy for competition) increased as a result of either greater initial barnacle density or reduced snail foraging pressure, but these effects depended on predation risk. 5. The effects of crab predation risk on snail foraging behavior weakened an otherwise strong relationship between barnacle density and hummock development: hummocking increased with barnacle density in the absence of crabs but remained relatively high when crabs were present. In communities with similar final barnacle densities, hummocking was more common in those with crabs than those without crabs. 6. The extent to which predators can drive trophic cascades by suppressing the foraging rates of their prey is highly context-dependent: the positive trait-mediated indirect effect of predators on basal resource abundance is stronger when many prey respond simultaneously to the threat of predation. However, our results demonstrate that top predators can also enhance competition among basal resources even when their indirect effect on resource abundance is relatively weak. Hence, the cascading effects of predators on competition within lower trophic levels may play an important but under-appreciated role in the dynamics of basal resource populations and the communities they support.",3a4a0ea18e038495c82ac1369042bb1e52fde7d4,,0

While plant disease resistance has traditionally been understood as the trait determined by the plant innate immune system and the pathogen virulence system, recent research underscores the pivotal role of the plant microbiome in disease resistance. Plant-associated microbiomes confer protection against pathogens through direct pathogen inhibition, resource competition, and activation of plant immune responses. Agricultural practices such as crop rotation, intercropping, disease-resistant breeding, biocontrol, and organic farming modulate plant microbiomes, thereby influencing disease resistance. This review synthesizes the latest advancements in understanding the intricate interactions among plants, pathogens, and microbiomes.

However, it is not yet understood whether niche packing is facilitated by higher specialization and reduced niche overlap or, rather, by diffuse competition and increased niche overlap. We combined highly resolved bird-plant interaction networks, bird phylogenies, and plant functional traits to compare dietary niche overlap and foraging frequencies among frugivorous birds at seven sites in the tropical Andes. We quantified niche overlap on the basis of the traits of the plants used by each bird and related it to the degree of niche packing at the different sites. Niche complementarity decreased with increasing niche packing, suggesting that increasingly dense niche packing is facilitated by increased niche overlap. Pairwise niche overlap was mediated by shifts in foraging frequencies away from shared resources, and it decreased with decreasing phylogenetic relatedness and increasing dependence on fruit as resource. Our findings suggest that foraging choices are a key axis of diversification in frugivorous birds and that differences in resource use frequencies are already sufficient to reduce potential competition between ecologically similar species and facilitate niche packing, especially if species differ in their dependence on particular resources.",3d2cf3292a563761899a0c484869b72885bbecb0,,0

Sexual dimorphism driven by intersexual resource competition: Why is it rare, and where to look for it? Journal of Animal Ecology, 00, 1-13. Ecological sexual dimorphism, that is differences between the sexes in traits that are naturally selected as opposed to sexually selected, is gaining increasing attention after having often been dismissed as the 'less-parsimonious' explanation for differences between sexes. One potential driver of ecological sexual dimorphism is intersexual resource competition, in a process analogous to ecological character displacement between species; yet, clear empirical examples are scarce. Li and Kokko present mathematical models that introduce novel pieces to the puzzle: the role of the scale of mating competition and the spatial variation in resource availability. They show that ecological sexual dimorphism evolves when local mating groups are small (e.g. monogamous pairs) and when different resources are homogeneously available across habitats. Counterintuitively, larger mating groups (e.g. polygyny), and consequently higher intralocus sexual conflict, lead to sexual monomorphism. Habitat heterogeneity also leads to overlapping niches, although it can sometimes drive polymorphism within sexes. This study highlights why the conditions for intrasexual resource competition to drive evolution of sexual dimorphism are stringent, even in the absence of genetic constraints or competing species. Crucially, it highlights the importance of considering the mating system and the spatial scale of resource competition for understanding the occurrence of ecological sexual dimorphism, showing a large potential for future work considering different aspects of species' life histories and spatial dynamics.",3f086f7e66cf7a17de08aef7861ed1220b2b34fc,,0

https://doi.org/10.1137/20m1321012,The Network HHD: Quantifying Cyclic Competition in Trait-Performance Models of Tournaments,"Competitive tournaments appear in sports, politics, population ecology, and animal behavior. All of these fields have developed methods for rating competitors and ranking them accordingly. A tournament is intransitive if it is not consistent with any ranking. Intransitive tournaments contain rock-paper-scissor type cycles. The discrete Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition (HHD) is well adapted to describing intransitive tournaments. It separates a tournament into perfectly transitive and perfectly cyclic components, where the perfectly transitive component is associated with a set of ratings. The size of the cyclic component can be used as a measure of intransitivity. Here we show that the HHD arises naturally from two classes of tournaments with simple statistical interpretations. We then discuss six different sets of assumptions that define equivalent decompositions. This analysis motivates the choice to use the HHD among other existing methods. Success in competition is typically mediated by the traits of the competitors. A trait-performance model assumes that the probability that one competitor beats another can be expressed as a function of their traits. We show that, if the traits of each competitor are drawn independently and identically from a trait distribution then the expected degree of intransitivity in the network can be computed explicitly. Using this result we show that increasing the number of pairs of competitors who could compete promotes cyclic competition, and that increasing the correlation in the performance of $A$ against $B$ with the performance of $A$ against $C$ promotes transitive competition. The expected size of cyclic competition can thus be understood by analyzing this correlation. An illustrative example is provided.",4194f1f304a6c09317fa720c4e43afa7ca92014a,,0

Aggregation among heterospecific individuals may require particular during-life traits, for example, traits limiting competition for space or resources. But is aggregation also facilitated by after-life traits accelerating decomposition of plant litters, notably through synergy among co-decomposing litters? We investigated the role of leaf traits, litter traits and litter-mixture decomposition in the spatial aggregation of individuals of pairs of grassland species in a long-term mesocosm experiment. We related aggregation between pairs of species to mean and dissimilarity in (a) during-life traits related to resource-acquisition and clonal dispersal, (b) after-life traits related to decomposition and (c) rate and synergy of decomposition. In most years, aggregation of heterospecific individuals strongly increased with means of (a) during-life clonal traits reducing competition for space, and (b) after-life traits increasing litter decomposition. Trait dissimilarities had comparatively less influence. Interestingly, in the last year, synergistic decomposition among litters improved species aggregation. Overall, after-life interactions due to fast and synergistic decomposition appear to increase during-life aggregation between individuals of different plant species.

https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9792,Life history and habitat do not mediate temporal changes in body size due to climate warming in rodents,"Temporal changes in body size have been documented in a number of vertebrate species, with different contested drivers being suggested to explain these changes. Among these are climate warming, resource availability, competition, predation risk, human population density, island effects and others. Both life history traits (intrinsic factors such as lifespan and reproductive rate) and habitat (extrinsic factors such as vegetation type, latitude and elevation) are expected to mediate the existence of a significant temporal response of body size to climate warming but neither have been widely investigated. Using examples of rodents, we predicted that both life history traits and habitat might explain the probability of temporal response using two tests of this hypothesis. Firstly, taking advantage of new data from museum collections spanning the last 106 years, we investigated geographical and temporal variation in cranial size (a proxy for body size) in six African rodent species of two murid subfamilies (Murinae and Gerbillinae) of varying life history, degree of commensality, range size, and habitat. Two species, the commensal Mastomys natalensis, and the non-commensal Otomys unisulcatus showed significant temporal changes in body size, with the former increasing and the latter decreasing, in relation with climate warming. Commensalism could explain the increase in size with time due to steadily increasing food availability through increased agricultural production. Apart from this, we found no general life history or habitat predictors of a temporal response in African rodents. Secondly, in order to further test this hypothesis, we incorporated our data into a meta-analysis based on published literature on temporal responses in rodents, resulting in a combined dataset for 50 species from seven families worldwide; among these, 29 species showed no significant change, eight showed a significant increase in size, and 13 showed a decline in size. Using a binomial logistic regression model for these metadata, we found that none of our chosen life history or habitat predictors could significantly explain the probability of a temporal response to climate warming, reinforcing our conclusion based on the more detailed data from the six African species.",4399fcf6da6546e6c28af32b1c14e138b96ec2e5,,0

A Case–Control Study,"A new postmodern depression type, named “Modern-Type Depression” (MTD), is emerging in Western countries. MTD is often underdiagnosed, mainly due to potentially higher comorbidity with technology-based addictions, including Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD). However, the definition of the relationship between MTD and IGD is still controversial, as few data have been published thus far. In particular, there are no data specifically investigating the prevalence of MTD within Italian young subjects with IGD, as well as their mutual association. Hence, within the SWATCH (Social Withdrawal and TeCno-mediated mental Health issues) project, our study aimed to identify the prevalence of MTD in a sample of Italian young adults who play video games by providing a clinical characterization of MTD within a group of IGD individuals (IGD+) versus a group without IGD (IGD−) who play video games. Our cross-sectional case–control study recruited a sample of 543 Italian young video-gaming players (aged 18–35) from the larger SWATCH database, stratified as IGD+ versus IGD−. Subjects were administered the 22-item Tarumi’s Modern-Type Depression Trait Scale (TACS-22), the Motives for Online Gaming Questionnaire (MOGQ), and the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short Form (IGDS9-SF). Around 21.7% of the total sample was represented by MTD individuals, while within the IGD sample, around 34% of subjects had MTD. Within the MTD group, significantly higher scores at IGDS-9SF (p < 0.001), MOGQ “Escape from reality” (p < 0.001), “Fantasy” (p < 0.001), and MOGQ total score (p = 0.003) were found compared to MTD−. According to the multivariate regression model, controlled for sex and age, higher scores in the TACS-22 were positively predicted by the total score of IGDS9-SF (p = 0.003), the MOGQ “Escape from Reality” subscale (p = 0.014), and MOGQ “Fantasy” (p = 0.011), and negatively predicted by the MOGQ “Competition” subscale (p = 0.035) [F (4538) = 17.265; p < 0.001]. Our findings suggested that MTD displays a strong association with IGD. Video-gaming players who do not have IGD appear to be less prone to MTD; this suggests that further studies could be carried out to specifically investigate whether pathological use of video games could also be determined by the presence of MTD.",4526600b760ac778e1b2b87450f3a5da342532a7,,0
https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.29.442023,Disentangling how multiple traits drive 2 strain frequencies in SIS dynamics with coinfection,"A general theory for competitive dynamics among many strains at the epidemiological level is required to understand polymorphisms in virulence, transmissibility, antibiotic resistance and other biological traits of infectious agents. Mathematical coinfection models have addressed specific systems, focusing on the criteria leading to stable coexistence or competitive exclusion, however, due to their complexity and nonlinearity, analytical solutions in coinfection models remain rare. Here we study a 2-strain SIS compartmental model with co-infection/co-colonization, incorporating multiple fitness dimensions under the same framework: variation in transmissibility, duration of carriage, pairwise susceptibilities to coinfection, coinfection duration, and transmission priority effects from mixed coinfection. Taking advantage of a singular perturbation approach, under the assumption of strain similarity, we expose how strain dynamics on a slow timescale are explicitly governed by a replicator equation which encapsulates all traits and their interplay. This allows us to predict explicitly not only the final epidemiological outcome of a given 2-player competition, but moreover, their entire frequency dynamics as a direct function of their relative variation and of strain-transcending global parameters. Based on mutual invasion fitnesses, we analyze and report rigorous results on transition phenomena in the 2-strain system, strongly mediated via coinfection prevalence. We show that coinfection is not always a promoter of coexistence; instead, its effect to favour or prevent polymorphism is non-monotonic and depends on the type and level of phenotypic differentiation between strains. This framework offers a deeper analytical understanding of 2-strain competitive games in coinfection, with theoretical and practical applications in epidemiology, ecology and evolution.",454b74faedc5bcb00833ba7832bbfefb5273faf8,,0

While spatial heterogeneity generates spatially disruptive selection favoring variation between patches, local competition can lead to locally disruptive selection promoting variation within patches. So far, almost all theory has studied these two processes in isolation. Here, we use mathematical modelling to investigate how resource variation within and between habitats influences the evolution of variation in a consumer population where individuals compete in finite patches connected by dispersal. We find that locally and spatially disruptive selection typically act in concert, favoring polymorphism under a significantly wider range of conditions than when in isolation. But when patches are small and dispersal between them is low, kin competition inhibits the emergence of polymorphism, especially when driven by local competition. We further use our model to clarify what comparisons between trait and neutral genetic differentiation (Qst/Fst comparisons) can tell about the nature of selection. Overall, our results help understand the interaction between two major drivers of diversity: locally and spatially disruptive selection; and how this interaction is modulated by the unavoidable effects of kin selection under limited dispersal.",4873223bda232806dbf4e6afc3d0ccff915b225e,,0
https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01149-25,Toroidal displacement of Klebsiella pneumoniae by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a unique mechanism to avoid competition for iron,"ABSTRACT Competition for resources is one of the major drivers for evolution and retention of new traits in microbial communities. Quorum sensing-dependent traits of the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa allow it to survive and thrive in the presence of other microbes. Here, we report a unique mechanism that P. aeruginosa employs specifically against Klebsiella pneumoniae to displace it on solid surfaces. Interestingly, P. aeruginosa employs neither proteases nor toxic secondary metabolites against K. pneumoniae. Rhamnolipid biosurfactant under the control of the RhlR quorum sensing system appears to be the primary factor required to displace Klebsiella effectively. Under conditions of iron limitation, both bacteria produce iron-scavenging molecules, while P. aeruginosa also produces rhamnolipid biosurfactant, allowing it to push Klebsiella cells away from the substratum. Our study describes a unique quorum and iron-responsive mechanism in P. aeruginosa to support its own growth during resource competition on a solid surface. IMPORTANCE Competition is common among organisms in nature. Bacteria have been known to deal with their neighbors using toxins and enzymes that kill or disable the latter. Here, we describe a simple, detergent-mediated mechanism that a common bacterium employs against its neighbor to push them away. This only happens in a time of scarcity of iron, an element essential for life, big and small. Competition is common among organisms in nature.

Using two spatially explicit mating models that analyse the genotypes of seeds and seedlings, we investigated the variation of male and female fecundities within and among three European beech (Fagus sylvatica) stands situated along an altitudinal gradient. Female and male individual fecundity distributions were both skewed in this monoecious species, and we found a higher variance in female as compared to male fecundities. Both female and male fecundities increased with tree size and decreased with density and competition in the neighbourhood, the details of these effects suggesting sex‐specific strategies to deal with the impact of limited resource on fecundity. The studied populations were functionally male‐biased. Among‐individual variations in functional gender were not driven by tree size but by density and competition in the neighbourhood. Femaleness decreased under limited resource availability, an expected consequence of the higher cost of female reproduction. Considering the variation of gene flow and genetic drift across elevation, our results suggest that the adaptive potential could be enhanced by low genetic drift at low elevation, and by high pollen‐mediated gene flow at high elevation. Finally, this study predicts a more efficient response to selection for traits related to male vs. female fitness, for a given selection intensity.",49c1390f4001537dd9c1116be9018f1909b3f900,,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/J.2007.0030-1299.15430.X,Architectural and growth traits differ in effects on performance of clonal plants: an analysis using a field-parameterized simulation model,"Individual traits are often assumed to be linked in a straightforward manner to plant performance and processes such as population growth, competition and community dynamics. However, because no trait functions in isolation in an organism, the effect of any one trait is likely to be at least somewhat contingent on other trait values. Thus, to the extent that the suite of trait values differs among species, the magnitude and even direction of correlation between values of any particular trait and performance is likely to differ among species. Working with a group of clonal plant species, we assessed the degree of this contingency and therefore the extent to which the assumption of simple and general linkages between traits and performance is valid. To do this, we parameterized a highly calibrated, spatially explicit, individual-based model of clonal plant population dynamics and then manipulated one trait at a time in the context of realistic values of other traits for each species. The model includes traits describing growth, resource allocation, response to competition, as well as architectural traits that determine spatial spread. The model was parameterized from a short-term (3 month) experiment and then validated with a separate, longer term (two year) experiment for six clonal wetland sedges, Carex lasiocarpa, Carex sterilis, Carex stricta, Cladium mariscoides, Scirpus acutus and Scirpus americanus. These plants all co-occur in fens in southeastern Michigan and represent a spectrum of clonal growth forms from strong clumpers to runners with long rhizomes. 
 
 
 
Varying growth, allocation and competition traits produced the largest and most uniform responses in population growth among species, while variation in architectural traits produced responses that were smaller and more variable among species. This is likely due to the fact that growth and competition traits directly affect mean ramet size and number of ramets, which are direct components of population biomass. In contrast, architectural and allocation traits determine spatial distribution of biomass; in the long run, this also affects population size, but its net effect is more likely to be mediated by other traits. Such differences in how traits affect plant performance are likely to have implications for interspecific interactions and community structure, as well as on the interpretation and usefulness of single trait optimality models.",4a0b2037c61bbfb5c6c6d9747adc861cb6478fd6,,0

https://doi.org/10.1101/523720,Eco-Evolutionary Feedbacks Between Predator’s Linkage Disequilibrium and Prey Densities Maintain Diversity,"Diversity occurs at multiple scales. Within a single population, there is diversity in genotypes and phenotypes. At a larger scale, within ecological communities, there is diversity in species. There have been a number of studies to investigate how diversity at these two scales influence each other through what has been termed eco-evolutionary feedbacks. Here we study a three-species ecological module called apparent competition, in which the predator is evolving in a trait that determines its interaction with two prey species. Unlike previous studies on apparent competition, which employed evolutionary frameworks with greatly simplified genetics, we study a multilocus eco-evolutionary model in which the predator’s evolving trait is determined by two diallelic loci. We ask how eco-evolutionary feedbacks with these two loci affect the coexistence of the prey species and the maintenance of polymorphisms within the predator species. In doing so, we uncover a novel eco-evolutionary feedback between the prey species and the linkage disequilibrium of the two loci of the predator. Through a stability analysis, we demonstrate how these feedbacks affect polymorphisms at both loci and, among others, may generate stable cycling.",4cb1056c4a5b55c1c71f62079100286349750ab5,,0

https://doi.org/10.1186/s40529-017-0183-9,Allelopathy and resource competition: the effects of Phragmites australis invasion in plant communities,"BackgroundPhragmites australis, a ubiquitous wetland plant, has been considered one of the most invasive species in the world. Allelopathy appears to be one of the invasion mechanisms, however, the effects could be masked by resource competition among target plants. The difficulty of distinguishing allelopathy from resource competition among plants has hindered investigations of the role of phytotoxic allelochemicals in plant communities. This has been addressed via experiments conducted in both the greenhouse and laboratory by growing associated plants, Melaleuca ericifolia, Rumex conglomeratus, and model plant, Lactuca sativa at varying densities with the allelopathic plant, P. australis, its litter and leachate of P. australis litter. This study investigated the potential interacting influences of allelopathy and resource competition on plant growth–density relationships.ResultsIn greenhouse, the root exudates mediated effects showed the strongest growth inhibition of M. ericifolia at high density whereas litter mediated results revealed increased growth at medium density treatments compared to low and high density. Again, laboratory experiments related to seed germination and seedling growth of L. sativa and R. conglomeratus exhibited phytotoxicity decreased showing positive growth as plant density increased and vice versa. Overall, the differential effects were observed among experiments but maximum individual plant biomass and some other positive effects on plant traits such as root and shoot length, chlorophyll content occurred at an intermediate density. This was attributed to the sharing of the available phytotoxin among plants at high densities which is compatible to density-dependent phytotoxicity model.ConclusionsThe results demonstrated that plant–plant interference is the combined effect of allelopathy and resource competition with many other factors but this experimental design, target-neighbor mixed-culture in combination of plant grown at varying densities with varying level of phytotoxins, mono-culture, can successfully separate allelopathic effects from competition.",4e5edb95401244c59018627c967ca8d6ede1948b,,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1439-0310.2007.01417.X,Size-Related Advantages for Reproduction in a Slightly Dimorphic Raptor: Opposite Trends between the Sexes,"Despite many comparative analyses and more than 20 proposed hypotheses, there is still little consensus over the factors promoting the evolution of reversed sexual dimorphism (RSD) in raptorial species. Furthermore, intrapopulation studies, which may elucidate how RSD is maintained once evolved, have been surprisingly scarce and only focused on a handful of species with medium to high dimorphism. We examined the reproductive advantages associated with body size and condition, measured in the pre-laying period, in a diurnal raptor with low sexual dimorphism, the black kite (Milvus migrans). The study population was essentially monomorphic in size. For females, there was an evidence of reproductive benefits associated with larger size and ⁄or with better body condition. Larger females had also access to higher quality partners and territories, consistent with the ‘intrasexual selection’ hypothesis, by which members of the larger sex enjoy size-related advantages in intrasexual competition over a scarce resource, the smaller sex. Opposite trends emerged for males: smaller, leaner males had higher breeding output, consistent with the ‘small efficient male’ hypothesis. Overall, the fact that we observed in an essentially monomorphic population the same selection pressures previously found in species with marked dimorphism suggests that such reproductive advantages may be counterbalanced in our study model by opposite selection pressures during other stages of the life cycle. This casts some doubts on the evolutionary significance of studies focusing exclusively on reproduction and calls for the need of more comprehensive analyses incorporating trait-mediated differentials in survival and recruitment.",4fac56dc43cca9e6d194e7a6b5aa5f8439c11e63,,0

https://doi.org/10.18174/466162,How plants balance competitive growth and defence : an analysis of virtual plants in dynamic interactions,"Plants grow in dynamic environments where their fitness is determined by a multitude of biotic and abiotic factors in the environment. These environments house complex webs of interactions in which plants must compete with neighbours for limited resources such as light, while having to defend against a multitude of heterotrophic organisms such as insect herbivores. Plants respond to cues related to neighbour presence and herbivore damage with a suite of induced shade avoidance and defence responses, respectively. One of the signals that interlinks these shade avoidance and defence responses is the red to far-red ratio (R:FR), which is a neighbour detection cue that induces shade avoidance responses and downregulates direct defence responses. This physiological linkage has been hypothesised as a mechanism that balances a resource allocation trade-off by promoting resource acquisition through competitive growth, at the expense of defence. However, the optimal expression of traits related to competitive growth and defence are not only dependent on biotic environmental factors, but also on interactions with the plant and herbivore communities. The aim of this thesis was to elucidate how ecological interactions shape the optimal balance between the acquisition and protection of resources. To reach this objective, I used a functional-structural plant (FSP) modelling approach to simulate physiological mechanisms that interact with the environment, how these mechanisms drive ecological interactions between plants and herbivores, and the evolutionary dynamics that arise from these interactions. In the general introduction (chapter 1), the linkage between competitive growth and defence is introduced from physiological, ecological and evolutionary perspectives, and FSP modelling is introduced as a tool to study the balance between competitive growth and defence. In this thesis, I describe and utilise two FSP models; an FSP model of Brassica nigra that focusses on detailed physiological responses and is parameterised and validated using field and greenhouse experiments, and an FSP model of a generic dicotyledon that focusses on evolutionary dynamics. In chapter 2, I outline my view on using FSP modelling to study interactions between the plant and herbivore communities and accentuate the importance of considering these interactions in a dynamic environment. In this chapter, I propose four alternative hypotheses to the origin of the physiological linkage between shade avoidance and defence responses that go beyond the perspective of resource allocation trade-offs between growth and defence. The downregulation of direct defence by a low R:FR cue may function to (i) focus defence on valuable tissues, (ii) deter specialist herbivores, (iii) control interactions within the insect herbivore community or (iv) prevent the emission of volatile cues to which neighbouring plants may respond. Chapter 3 presents an FSP model of B. nigra that combines mechanistic simulation of plant growth, shade avoidance responses and herbivore feeding, which are parameterised and validated using field and greenhouse experiments. This model is used to analyse the impact of herbivore feeding at different locations within the plant that relate to herbivore specialisation on plant fitness in a dynamic environment where plants compete for light. This analysis shows that herbivore damage had a larger effect on plant fitness when plants were competing for light and when the damage was directed at young leaves at the top of the canopy. Chapter 4 expands on the FSP model presented in chapter 3 with the addition of plant defence, and is used to analyse how the direct costs (e.g. metabolic costs) and benefits of defence as well as indirect costs and benefits of defence imposed through ecological interactions impact plant fitness. This analysis shows that ecological costs of defence imposed by inter-genotypic competition is the strongest determinant of plant fitness, amplifying size differences resulting from differences in defence investment. Additionally, the model shows that the benefit of plant defence relies on reducing herbivore damage rather than dispersing herbivore damage away from young leaves and towards older leaves that are of less value to the plant. Chapter 5 expands on the FSP model presented in chapter 4 with the addition of R:FR mediation of plant defence, to analyse the function of this physiological regulation from the perspective of simple versus competitive optimisation (e.g. mono-stands vs mixtures). The model results show that plant-level defence investment was a strong determinant of plant fitness, and that leaf-level mediation of plant defence by R:FR may provide an additional fitness benefit in high plant densities. Furthermore, the model shows that the optimal plant-level defence expression does not monotonically decrease with plant density. This indicates that R:FR mediation of defence alone is not sufficient to optimise plant-level defence between densities, as R:FR does monotonically decrease with plant density. Chapter 6 presents a new FSP model that simulates the evolutionary dynamics of a plant population, driven by competition for light and nitrogen in combination with herbivore damage. This evolutionary FSP model is used to analyse how optimal biomass allocation patterns changed with plant density, nitrogen availability and herbivore damage, and how these factors impact the optimal balance between the acquisition and protection of resources. The model results conform with the functional equilibria described by optimal partitioning theory (OPT), which predicts an increase in biomass allocation towards plant parts that partake in the acquisition of a limiting resource. The model further shows that optimal defence levels negatively correlate with nitrogen availability, and positively correlate with plant defence if an increase in plant density decreases the nitrogen availability per plant. This chapter concludes that the adaptive value of plant defence is dependent on the availability of, and competition for both above- and belowground resources. In the general discussion (chapter 7), I discuss the concepts and results presented in chapters 2-6 with respect to the main objective specified in the general introduction (chapter 1). First, I discuss how ecological interactions in a dynamic environment shape growth-defence integration and the challenges and opportunities of using FSP models to simulate these dynamic environments. To illustrate this I present additional simulations that show the effect of a variable plant density on optimal stem allocation, which indicates selection for a high density phenotype. Second, I discuss the role and viability of tolerance as an alternative to plant defence, which highlights the importance of modelling form and function when studying growth-defence integration. Third, I discuss the importance of considering herbivore community dynamics when studying growth-defence integration. To illustrate this importance I present additional simulations that show how specialist herbivores select against taxon-specific forms of defence expression, while generalist herbivores select for overexpression of taxon-specific forms of defence. Fourth, I discuss how considering multiple resources may change the optimal balance between the acquisition and protection of resources. Finally, I present my view on the future perspectives for FSP models of growth and defence, discussing the integration of multiple resources, neighbour detection cues, and dynamics resulting from a complex representation of plant and herbivore communities.",516fd7866bfdf1925d5b3e9bb1dbc7259647a3ac,,0

Description This dissertation provides a four-part synopsis of the methodology, results, and conclusions of an integrated set of experiments designed to explore the ecology of inducible trophic polymorphisms (ITPs). These experiments were conducted using isogenic populations of the polymorphic freshwater hymenostome ciliate, Tetrahymena vorax Kidder, in combination with other protozoa, bacteria, algae, and micro-invertebrates. Chapter 1 addresses the autecological significance of ITPs, revealing some of their potential costs and benefits to individuals in the context of competition under varying resource regimes. Chapter 2 demonstrates how ITPs can give rise to novel trait-mediated indirect interactions that affect community structure and population dynamics. Chapter 3 elucidates the extent to which the population dynamics of species exhibiting ITPs are affected by the trophic complexity of their habitat. Chapter 4 presents a detailed review of indirect offenses, a versatile adaptive strategy that ITPs can give rise to where inducing agents are symbionts. The contents of these chapters provide unique insights into the link between ITPs and related phenomena – such as cannibalism, intraguild predation, omnivory, and expanded diet breadth – and open new avenues of inquiry regarding the importance of the genetic and functional diversity of natural communities.

To assess the extent of pollinator sharing we analysed nectar properties and recorded the pollinator fauna, their behaviour and contribution to seed set. To test for competition via interspecific pollen transfer, we recorded the movement patterns of pollinators and quantified pollen loads. To determine the effect of co-flowering on visitation rates we recorded visits in stands that varied in the density of the two species. We found that the species produce similar rewards and share pollinating Cape Sugarbirds (Promerops cafer). Interspecific pollen transfer is avoided by placing pollen on different parts of the bird. Both species are visited by nectar-thieving Orange-breasted Sunbirds (Anthobaphes violacea). Insects and autonomous self-pollination contributed little to seed set. Pollinator visits increased with conspecific density in both species, and the slope of the increase was steepest in the presence of high densities of the co-occurring plant species. Nectar thief visits also increased with conspecific density in both species, but the slope declined with increasing density of the co-occurring species. Co-occurrence enhanced pollinator visits and alleviated nectar robbing in both plant species, consistent with mutualisms. Mutualism within a trophic level is unusual, but may help to explain the stable coexistence of ecologically similar species.",58d5d2a03713c71b40d99b820b75b78f313e0755,,0
https://doi.org/10.1093/ismeco/ycae148,Distinct phytoplankton size classes respond differently to biotic and abiotic factors,"Abstract The interplay between abiotic (resource supply, temperature) and biotic (grazing) factors determines growth and loss processes in phytoplankton through resource competition and trophic interactions, which are mediated by morphological traits like size. Here, we study the relative importance of grazers, water physics, and chemistry on the daily net accumulation rates (ARs) of individual phytoplankton from natural communities, grouped into six size classes from circa 10 to 500 μm. Using a Random Forest modelling approach and 4 years of daily data from a lake, we find that water temperature is generally a pivotal control of all phytoplankton ARs. At the same time, nutrients and light are important for the smallest and the largest classes. Mesozooplankton abundance is a key predictor of the AR for small phytoplankton, with microzooplankton being important for the middle-size range. In our data, large and small phytoplankton have different (seasonal) blooming patterns: small forms are favoured by low temperature and grazing, and high phosphorus levels. Larger forms show positive ARs at high temperatures and low phosphorus (being relatively insensitive to zooplankton grazing). These results help us understand the opportunities and limitations of using size to explain and model phytoplankton responses to biotic and abiotic environmental change.",5962b975451e1735bb1d7225f46dcc399c118301,,0

https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13785,Eco‐evolutionary feedbacks between prey densities and linkage disequilibrium in the predator maintain diversity,"Diversity occurs at multiple scales. Within a single population, there is diversity in genotypes and phenotypes. At a larger scale, within ecological communities, there is diversity in species. A number of studies have investigated how diversity at these two scales influence each other through what has been termed eco‐evolutionary feedbacks. Here we study a three‐species ecological module called apparent competition, in which the predator is evolving in a trait that determines its interaction with two prey species. Unlike previous studies on apparent competition, which employed evolutionary frameworks with very simple genetics, we study an eco‐evolutionary model in which the predator's trait is determined by two recombining diallelic loci, so that its mean and variance can evolve, as well as associations (linkage disequilibrium) between the loci. We ask how eco‐evolutionary feedbacks with these two loci affect the coexistence of the prey species and the maintenance of polymorphisms within the predator species. We uncover a novel eco‐evolutionary feedback between the prey densities and the linkage disequilibrium between the predator's loci. Through a stability analysis, we demonstrate how these feedbacks affect polymorphisms at both loci and, among others, may generate stable cycling.",5c1f5eee4236efd0386a6133a849a9af121aeafb,,0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-13-97,"The expression and evolution of virulence in multiple infections: the role of specificity, relative virulence and relative dose","BackgroundMultiple infections of the same host by different strains of the same microparasite species are believed to play a crucial role during the evolution of parasite virulence. We investigated the role of specificity, relative virulence and relative dose in determining the competitive outcome of multiple infections in the Daphnia magna-Pasteuria ramosa host-parasite system.ResultsWe found that infections by P. ramosa clones (single genotype) were less virulent and produced more spores than infections by P. ramosa isolates (possibly containing multiple genotypes). We also found that two similarly virulent isolates of P. ramosa differed considerably in their within-host competitiveness and their effects on host offspring production when faced with coinfecting P. ramosa isolates and clones. Although the relative virulence of a P. ramosa isolate/clone appears to be a good indicator of its competitiveness during multiple infections, the relative dose may alter the competitive outcome. Moreover, spore counts on day 20 post-infection indicate that the competitive outcome is largely decided early in the parasite’s growth phase, possibly mediated by direct interference or apparent competition.ConclusionsOur results emphasize the importance of epidemiology as well as of various parasite traits in determining the outcome of within-host competition. Incorporating realistic epidemiological and ecological conditions when testing theoretical models of multiple infections, as well as using a wider range of host and parasite genotypes, will enable us to better understand the course of virulence evolution.",5c92e6bccd050b8c2f54433ec2e967c7aa729006,,0

However, it has also been critiqued for its focus on traits (e.g. well-defined system boundaries) that are increasingly threatened by social and environmental trends. Fisheries are a key example of this challenge. While small-scale fisheries are critically important to the diets and livelihoods of millions, industrial fisheries from developed countries now dominate fishing around the world. While these two systems are governed separately, there is substantial overlap between them, conceptualized as the growing influence of globalization on local common pool resource (CPR) systems. One of the most impactful, but least understood consequences of this convergence are the emerging conflicts and competition between small-scale and industrial fisheries. In these systems, the interaction between small-scale CPRs and globalized commodity chains has meant the creation of a new, hybrid resource system, addressed by neither conventional industrial nor traditional small-scale governance approaches. We use empirical data from 396 cases of interactions at sea between globalized industrial and local small-scale fishers in Ghana from 1984 to 2013 to examine the conditions under which resource users conflict or cooperate, linking them to broader political and economic dynamics across scales. We consider the institutional factors that mediate these interactions, identifying policies to promote cooperative, and avert conflictual incidents. We further consider the long-term effects of these patterns of conflict and cooperation for the resilience or vulnerability of the resource base, the fishers, and the institutions governing the system. We suggest that specific governance arrangements that reduce disparities between groups, promote bridging social capital, and enhance hybrid and cross-scale institutions offer the best potential to govern resource systems where traditional CPRs and market-oriented industries converge.",5d9aae6efa2182b0743dc8455a96b4c3b654d4ad,,0
https://doi.org/10.7287/PEERJ.PREPRINTS.1646V1,Relationships between taxonomic and functional diversity: insights into assembly processes,"Among the potential indicators of biodiversity, those based on the functional traits of species are interesting because they measure the aspects of diversity that potentially affect community assembly and function. However, trait-based approaches are still rarely considered and little is known about the degree to which taxonomic diversity (TD) and functional diversity (FD) are correlated. Yet, this relationship is thought to depend on the extent of ecological redundancy within the assemblage, i.e. the number of taxonomically distinct species that exhibit similar ecological functions. In this study, we characterized taxonomic and functional diversity within and between two marine habitats (rocky shore vs mudflats) under human-induced disturbances. Models were also used to test whether the relationship between TD and FD differed according to the indices used to characterize them. We found little effect of human disturbance on the shape of the TD-FD relationship, whereas communities of the mudflat appeared to be less redundant than those of rocky shore. This could be explained by the assembly rules of ecosystems: biotic filtering (competition and resource partitioning) reduces redundancy by selecting for functionally dissimilar species, whereas abiotic filtering increases redundancy by selecting for similar species sharing adaptations to a particular environment. The rocky shore environment is characterized by heterogeneity that allows the formation of distinct ecological niches that can be colonized by similar species: the abiotic filtering does not limit the redundancy permitted by habitat. Conversely, in the more homogeneous environment of mudflat, the biotic filter mitigates redundancy. Trait-mediated abiotic filtering appears to play an important role in community assembly in complex habitats, whereas the relative importance of competitive exclusion appears to be greater in homogeneous habitats.",5eb27184e75eb15bacbf611aedfcb7f427853686,,0

https://doi.org/10.1002/9780470015902.A0021216,Nonconsumptive Effects of Predators and Trait‐Mediated Indirect Effects,"Phenotypic plasticity in species’ traits is ubiquitous across taxa and habitats. This plasticity can affect the qualitative and quantitative nature of species interactions and thereby affect food webs. Empirical work has focused on predator–prey interactions, in part because most prey respond to predator presence through a suite of traits that reduce risk. These responses can incur costs in fitness correlates (e.g. growth and survival) of the prey, i.e. are nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) of predators. Further, these responses can lead to indirect effects transmitted through the prey to other species in the food web, termed trait-mediated indirect effects (TMIEs). NCEs and TMIEs have been demonstrated in a wide range of communities and across diverse taxa. These effects can contribute substantially to the influence of predators (including through competition, trophic cascades and keystone predation), and therefore can play a critical role in the dynamics and structure of ecological communities. 
 
 
 
Key concepts 
 
 
 
Phenotypic plasticity in species traits is widespread and represented across diverse taxa and ecosystems. 
 
 
 
 
To reduce predation risk, organisms respond to predator (including herbivore) presence by modifying traits, including developmental, morphological, physiological, life historical and behavioural characteristics. 
 
 
 
 
Phenotypic responses to predators often incur a cost to prey fitness correlates such as growth rate and survival. These costs to fitness are termed nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) of the predator on its prey, to distinguish them from the consumptive effects (CEs) due to predation. 
 
 
 
 
Phenotypic responses by prey to predators alter the nature of the interactions between prey and other (third) species. The predator is said to have a trait-mediated indirect effect (TMIE) on the third species through induced changes in the intermediate species’ (prey's) traits. 
 
 
 
 
Predator-induced changes in prey traits can lead to TMIEs of the predator on prey resources (resulting in trait-mediated trophic cascades), prey competitors and other predators of the prey. 
 
 
 
 
NCEs and TMIEs can qualitatively change the nature of species interactions. For example, predator-induced changes in prey traits can reverse competitive interactions, and lead to increases in prey growth rates due to strong TMIEs on prey resources. 
 
 
 
 
NCEs and TMIEs can contribute strongly, and even dominate, the net effect of predators on prey and net indirect effect of the predator on species the prey interacts with. Thus, they can strongly affect prey population growth rates, community structure and ecosystem processes. 
 
 
 
 
Factors, such as temperature, resource growth rates, prey density and prey–competitor density, can strongly influence the magnitude of NCEs and TMIEs. 
 
 
 
 
It will be necessary to formally incorporate phenotypic responses of prey to predators into the conceptual foundations of ecology and strategies for the management of ecological systems.

https://doi.org/10.1093/BEHECO/ART069,Prey handling performance facilitates competitive dominance of an invasive over native keystone ant,"Studies of species coexistence in ant communities often suggest that competitive interactions are mediated by behavioral trade-offs between resource discovery and dominance. However, these studies have always measured foraging at artificial, static baits that omit traits of living prey items and potential coevolutionary predator–prey relationships. In a series of lab experiments, we compare the ability of ants to harvest live termites (Reticulitermes virginicus) in nests varying in defensive ability. Moreover, we compare foraging performance of 2 co-occurring ant species—the North American native Aphaenogaster rudis and the invasive Pachycondyla chinensis—differing in their evolutionary experience hunting R. virginicus. Our results show how the invasive P. chinensis may displace the native keystone A. rudis by directly killing A. rudis workers and reducing termite prey available for A. rudis. Specifically, P. chinensis is more sensitive to novel termite prey than the native A. rudis and then destroys termite colonies—even if they are highly defended by soldiers or nest architecture. Our results further show how whole colony behavioral dominance by P. chinensis is mediated by behavioral interactions among individual workers. More generally, our experimental approach using live prey to study interspecific competition can integrate evolutionary dynamics into studies of proximate behavioral factors governing species coexistence.",60a146cdb8d3edeefbb701ba8e68a42467b8664f,,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ECS2.2564,Mistletoe generates non‐trophic and trait‐mediated indirect interactions through a shared host of herbivore consumers,"Indirect interactions emerge among a wide range of herbivores sharing the same plant resource. Consumers usually belong to different trophic guilds, from folivores and sapsuckers to parasitic plants. We propose that mistletoes parasitizing pines could play a key role acting as herbivores on host pines and coming indirectly into competition with other herbivores feeding on the same host. Changes caused by mistletoes on its host have been well studied, but its effects running across trophic webs remain unrevealed. In this study, we investigate the effect of European mistletoe (Viscum album subsp. austriacum) on the host‐feeding herbivores via trait‐mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) across their shared pine host (Pinus nigra subsp. salzmannii). We performed field and laboratory experiments, and analyzed the net effect of different mistletoe parasite loads on three host‐phytophagous species: the sapsucker Cinara pini (Aphididae), the winter folivore Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Thaumetopoeidae), and the summer folivore Brachyderes sp. (Curculionidae), all being members of different functional feeding groups (FFGs). We summarize the mistletoe–host–herbivore interactions by means of a TMII, where mistletoe parasitism causes non‐trophic links and detrimental indirect interactions on pine‐feeding herbivores across its shared host, suggesting a worsening of host quality as food. These indirect interactions vary according to three parameters. First, the intensity has a non‐proportional relation with parasite load, showing an impact threshold on highly parasitized pines. Second, the movement capacity of insect herbivores determines their response, by decreasing the abundance of herbivores with low movement ability (aphids and pine processionary caterpillars) while altering the behavior (plant selection) of more mobile herbivores (pine weevils). Finally, FFG determines the intensity of mistletoe parasitism effects, folivores being more responsive than sapsuckers. Overall, mistletoe generates non‐trophic interaction linkages in the forest able to modify community structure by becoming a nexus of the entire herbivore community of the pine canopy.",60ec2d431da27441c4daca0d3c8f666dba15514b,,0

The role of the juvenile hormone (JH) as a potential mediator in the trade-off between male‐ male competition and immune response has not been tested, but its study could reveal a potential mechanism that mediates resource allocation between these two traits. 2. Controlling for body size, we tested whether males of the territorial damselfly Calopteryx virgo administrated with methoprene acid, an analog of the JH (JHa), compared to control males, increased their aggression and occupation time on territories but decreased their phenoloxidase (PO) activity (a key enzyme used during immune response after a bacterial challenge). We found an increase in aggression in JHa treated males compared to control males, but the opposite was found for PO activity. 3. As fat load and muscle mass are also important traits during a contest, we tested whether JHa males compared to control males showed more fat and muscle content 2 h after JHa administration. Our results did not show a significant difference between both male groups, suggesting that JHa only increased aggression. 4. These results and a review of other published articles, which have documented an effect of JH on a variety of functions in insects, suggest that JH may be a target of sexual selection: this hormone not only promotes the expression of secondary sexual characters but also seems condition-dependent and so its titers may indicate male condition.",635871806a1f62b695b141b815db5be43d689558,,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.4320,Extending trait dispersion across trophic levels: Predator assemblages act as top-down filters on prey communities.,"Studies of community assembly typically focus on the effects of abiotic environmental filters and stabilizing competition on functional trait dispersion within single trophic levels. Predation is a well-known driver of community diversity and composition, yet the role of functionally diverse predator communities in filtering prey community traits has received less attention. We examined functionally diverse communities of predators (fishes) and prey (epifaunal crustaceans) in eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds in two northern California estuaries to evaluate the filtering effects of predator traits on community assembly and how filters acting on predators influence their ability to mediate prey community assembly. Fish traits related to bottom orientation were correlated with more clustered epifauna communities, and epifauna were generally overdispersed while fishes were clustered, suggesting prey may be pushed to disparate areas of trait space to avoid capture by benthic sit-and-wait predators. We also found correlations between the trait dispersions of predator and prey communities that strengthened after accounting for the effects of habitat filters on predator dispersion, suggesting that habitat filtering effects on predator species pools may hinder their ability to affect prey community assembly. Our results present compelling observational evidence that specific predator traits have measurable impacts on the community assembly of prey, inviting experimental tests of predator trait means on community assembly and explicit comparisons of how the relative effects of habitat filters and intraguild competition on predators impact their ability to affect prey community assembly. Integrating our understanding of traits at multiple trophic levels can help us better predict the impacts of community composition on food web dynamics as regional species pools shift with climate change and anthropogenic introductions.",63680b02c30004b280223c9181304595ef222d8a,,0

However, firm evidence that members of more heterogeneous groups benefit from enhanced survival has been scarce or lacking. Furthermore, benefits associated with phenotypic diversity may be counterbalanced by costs mediated by reduced relatedness, since closely related individuals typically are more similar. Pygmy grasshoppers (Tetrix subulata) are characterized by extensive polymorphism in colour pattern, morphology, behaviour and physiology. We studied experimental groups founded by different numbers of mothers and found that survival was higher in low than in high density, that survival peaked at intermediate colour morph diversity in high density, and that survival was independent of diversity in low density where competition was less intense. We further demonstrate that survival was enhanced by relatedness, as expected if antagonistic and competitive interactions are discriminately directed towards non-siblings. We therefore also performed behavioural observations and staged encounters which confirmed that individuals recognized and responded differently to siblings than to non-siblings. We conclude that negative effects associated with competition are less manifest in diverse groups, that there is conflicting selection for and against genetic diversity occurring simultaneously, and that diversity and relatedness may facilitate the productivity and ecological success of groups of interacting individuals.",65769989315f89c770907d78a483a56ef9121154,,0
https://doi.org/10.1146/ANNUREV.ES.01.110170.000245,The Units of Selection,"The principle of natural selection as the motive force for evolution was framed by Darwin in terms of a ""struggle for existence"" on the part of organisms living in a finite and risky environment. The logical skeleton of his argument, however, turns out to be a powerful predictive system for changes at all levels of biological organization. As seen by present-day evo­ lutionists, Darwin's scheme embodies three principles (Lewontin 1) : 1. Different individuals in a popUlation have different morphologies, physiologies, and behaviors (phenotypic variation). 2. Different phenotypes have different rates of survival and reproduc­ tion in different environments (differential fitness). 3. There is a correlation between parents and offspring in the contribu­ tion of each to future generations (fitness is heritable). These three principles embody the principle of evolution by natural selec­ tion. While they hold, a population will undergo evolutionary change. It is important to note a certain generality in the principles. No particular mechanism of inheritance is specifi'ed, but only a correlation in fitness between parent and offspring. The population would evolve whether the correlation between parent and offspring arose from Mendelian, cytoplasmic, or cultural inheritance. Conversely, when a population is at equilibrium under selection (for example, a stable polymorphism due to heterozygous superiority), there is no correlation in fitness between parent and offspring, no matter what the mechanism of inheritance. Nor does Principle 2 specify the reason for the differential rate of contribution to future generations of the different phenotypes. It is not necessary, for example, that resources be in short supply for organisms to struggle for existence. Darwin himself pointed out that ""a plant at the edge of a desert is said to struggle for life against the drought."" Thus, although Darwin came to the idea of natural selection from consideration of Malthus', essay on overpopulation, the element of competition between organisms for a resource in short supply is not integral to the argument. Natural selection occurs even when two bacterial strains are growing logarithmically in an excess of nutrient broth if they have different division times. The generality of the principles of natural selection means that any enti­ ties in nature that have variation, reproduction, and heritability may evolve. For example, if we replace the term individual with the term population and",658e5b0f6e9e3c8f49a34859baa5d6aaefe13869,,0

Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) inhabiting stream reaches with different predation regimes have rapidly evolved divergent life history traits. Here, we investigated the effects of both predation and resource availability on guppy trophic niches by evaluating their gut contents, resource standing stocks, and δ15N and δ13C stable isotopes across five streams during the wet season. We found that guppies from low predation (LP) sites had a consistently higher trophic position and proportion of invertebrates in their guts and assimilate less epilithon than guppies from high predation (HP) sites. Higher trophic position was also associated with lower benthic invertebrate availability. Our results suggest that LP guppies could be more efficient invertebrate consumers, possibly as an evolutionary response to greater intraspecific competition for higher quality food. This may be intensified by seasonality, as wet season conditions can alter resource availability, feeding rates, and the intensity of intraspecific competition. Understanding how guppy diets vary among communities is critical to elucidating the role of niche shifts in mediating the link between environmental change and the evolution of life histories.",66bcceb5c4c4b588a1b8e10af09a46502fe344f1,,0

A trade-off between immunity and reproduction is central to parasite-mediated models of sexual selection. In this study, I examine a prediction of postcopulatory models of parasite-mediated sexual selection that males face a nutrient allocation trade-off between immunity and ejaculate quality. I experimentally induced an antibacterial immune response in juvenile crickets held on either a restricted diet or allowed ad libitum access to food. Immune-challenged crickets took longer to reach adult eclosion, and crickets on a restricted diet had a greatly reduced ability to encapsulate a foreign body. Neither juvenile immune challenge nor diet influenced adult antibacterial activity. Crickets with restricted access to food had reduced sperm viability after upregulation of their antibacterial immunity when juvenile, whereas crickets fed ad libitum did not suffer a cost of reduced sperm viability. This finding provides evidence for a nutrient allocation trade-off between antibacterial immunity and ejaculate quality.

https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13935,Some neighbours are better than others: Variation in associational effects among plants in an old field community,"Consumer‐resource interactions are often influenced by other species in the community, such as when neighbouring plants increase or reduce herbivory to a focal plant species (known as associational effects). The many studies on associational effects between a focal plant and some neighbour have shown that these effects can vary greatly in strength and direction. But because almost all of these studies measure associational effects from only one or two neighbour species, we know little about the actual range of associational effects that a plant species might encounter in a natural setting. This makes it difficult to determine how important effects of neighbours are in real field settings, and how associational effects might interact with competition and other processes to influence plant community composition. In this study, we used a field experiment with a focal species, Solanum carolinense, and 11 common neighbour species to investigate how associational effects vary among many co‐occurring neighbour species and to test whether factors such as neighbour plant apparency, phylogenetic proximity to the focal species, or effects on focal plant defence traits help to explain interspecific variation in associational effect strength. We found that some neighbour species affected S. carolinense damage and attack by specialist herbivores, but associational effects of most neighbours were weak. Associational effects increased herbivore attack on average earlier in the season (associational susceptibility) and reduced herbivore attack on average later in the season (associational resistance) relative to S. carolinense in monoculture. We found some evidence that a neighbour's associational effect was related to its biomass and phylogenetic proximity to the focal species. While neighbour species differed in their effects on physical leaf traits of focal plants (trichome density, specific leaf area, and leaf toughness), these traits did not appear to mediate the effects of neighbours on focal plant herbivory. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the distribution of associational effect strengths in natural communities are similar to those observed for other interaction types, and that multiple mechanisms are likely acting simultaneously to shape associational effects of different neighbour species.",6873ec4c3e157bd89abd6f7810dc863436ab4ce0,,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.7211,Investigating the morphological and genetic divergence of arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) populations in lakes of arctic Alaska,"Abstract Polymorphism facilitates coexistence of divergent morphs (e.g., phenotypes) of the same species by minimizing intraspecific competition, especially when resources are limiting. Arctic char (Salvelinus sp.) are a Holarctic fish often forming morphologically, and sometimes genetically, divergent morphs. In this study, we assessed the morphological and genetic diversity and divergence of 263 individuals from seven populations of arctic char with varying length‐frequency distributions across two distinct groups of lakes in northern Alaska. Despite close geographic proximity, each lake group occurs on landscapes with different glacial ages and surface water connectivity, and thus was likely colonized by fishes at different times. Across lakes, a continuum of physical (e.g., lake area, maximum depth) and biological characteristics (e.g., primary productivity, fish density) exists, likely contributing to characteristics of present‐day char populations. Although some lakes exhibit bimodal size distributions, using model‐based clustering of morphometric traits corrected for allometry, we did not detect morphological differences within and across char populations. Genomic analyses using 15,934 SNPs obtained from genotyping by sequencing demonstrated differences among lake groups related to historical biogeography, but within lake groups and within individual lakes, genetic differentiation was not related to total body length. We used PERMANOVA to identify environmental and biological factors related to observed char size structure. Significant predictors included water transparency (i.e., a primary productivity proxy), char density (fish·ha‐1), and lake group. Larger char occurred in lakes with greater primary production and lower char densities, suggesting less intraspecific competition and resource limitation. Thus, char populations in more productive and connected lakes may prove more stable to environmental changes, relative to food‐limited and closed lakes, if lake productivity increases concomitantly. Our findings provide some of the first descriptions of genomic characteristics of char populations in arctic Alaska, and offer important consideration for the persistence of these populations for subsistence and conservation.",6c9ac6acbc37f6cd41f706e39d12d5a9fbe96a8d,,0

In many systems, the determinants of success are not well known. Where species have parental care, for example, determinants of success can be particularly challenging to partition between parents and offspring. In this thesis I investigate drivers and consequences of variable life histories, for a small reef fish that exhibits male parental care (the common triplefin Forsterygion lapillum).

My life history trait reconstructions suggested two alternate pathways to ’success’ for adult males. Successful males hatched earlier and therefore had a developmental ’head start’ over less successful males (i.e., males with eggs > male territory holders without eggs > floaters). Alternatively, males can apparently achieve success by growing faster: for males born in the same month, those with eggs grew faster than those with territories and no eggs, and both groups grew faster than floaters. These results suggest that accelerated growth rate may mediate the effects of a later hatch date, and that both hatch dates and growth rates influence the success of adult males, likely through proximate effects on individual phenotypes.  Identifying sources of variation in individual reproductive success is crucial to our understanding of population dynamics and evolutionary ecology. In many systems, the determinants of success are not well known. Where species have parental care, for example, determinants of success can be particularly challenging to partition between parents and offspring. Male parental care is common among fishes, where resources such as high quality territories and mates often may be limiting. In such systems, individual success of offspring may result from distinct life history pathways that are influenced by both parental effects (e.g., timing of reproduction) and by the offspring themselves (e.g., ’personalities’). These pathways, in turn, can induce phenotypic variation and affect success later in life. The drivers and consequences of variable life histories are not well understood in the context of reproductive success.  In this thesis I investigate drivers and consequences of variable life histories, for a small reef fish that exhibits male parental care (the common triplefin Forsterygion lapillum). I examined the influence of individual life history, phenotype and behaviour on (1) the performance of recently settled juveniles, and (2) the reproductive success adult males. I made field-based observations of adult males during the breeding season, measured their phenotypic traits (body size and condition) and used their otoliths to reconstruct life history characteristics (hatch dates and mean growth rates). Some males showed no evidence of territorial defence and were defined as ’floaters’; others defended territories, and a subset of these also had nests with eggs present. Adult male body size was significantly higher for males that defended breeding territories, and body condition was significantly higher for the males that had eggs (i.e., had successfully courted females). My otolith-based reconstructions of life history traits suggested two alternate pathways to ’success’ for adult males. Successful males hatched earlier and therefore had a developmental ’head start’ over less successful males (i.e., males with eggs > male territory holders without eggs > floaters). Alternatively, males can apparently achieve success by growing faster: for males born in the same month, those with eggs grew faster than those with territories and no eggs, and both groups grew faster than floaters. These results suggest that accelerated growth rate may mediate the effects of a later hatch date, and that both hatch dates and growth rates influence the success of adult males, likely through proximate effects on individual phenotypes.  I evaluated the effects of variable life history in a complimentary lab-based study. Specifically, I manipulated the developmental environments (feeding regime and temperature) for young fish and evaluated the direct effects on life history traits and phenotypes. Then, I conducted an assay to quantify the indirect effects of developmental environment, life history traits, and phenotypes on aggression and performance of young fish. These developmental environments did not have a clear, overall effect on juvenile phenotype or performance (i.e. behavioural aggression and the ability to dominate a resource). Instead, individuals (irrespective of developmental environment) that grew faster and/or longer pelagic larval durations had increased odds of dominating a limited resource. I attributed the non-significant direct effect of developmental environment to within-treatment mortality and variation among individuals in terms of their realised access to food (i.e., dominance hierarchies were apparent in rearing chambers, suggesting a non-uniform access to food). Fish that were more likely to dominate a resource were also more aggressive (i.e., more likely to engage in chasing behaviours). Fish that were larger and more aggressive established territories that were deemed to be of higher ’quality’ (inferred from percent cover of cobble resources). Overall, this study suggests a complex interplay between social systems, phenotype and life history. Developmental environments may influence phenotypes, although behavioural differences among individuals may moderate that effect, contributing to additional variation in phenotypes and life history traits which, in turn, shape the success of individuals.  Collectively, my thesis emphasises the consequences of life history variability on success at multiple life stages. These results may be relevant to other species that exhibit male parental care or undergo intense competition for space during early life stages. In addition, my results highlight interactions between life history, phenotype and behaviour that can have important implications for population dynamics and evolutionary ecology.",6ec3f26bb3247930d256d72987b7e084eac7d40b,,0

There is a growing appreciation of the need to understand the effects of climate change on species interactions and how changes in interactions can influence the ability of species to persist in the face of climate change (Araújo and Luoto, 2007; Thuiller et al., 2008; Svenning et al., 2014). However, empirical or experimental studies investigating species interactions under climate change remain extremely scarce. Alexander et al. (2015) use experimental transplants of European alpine plant species and communities to provide valuable insight into some of the novel competitive interactions that may emerge as species migrate upslope to keep pace with rising temperatures. More specifically, they look at performance of plant species under simulated upslope migrations into preexisting higher-elevation plant communities as well as the performance of plant species that fail to migrate and find themselves competing with new suites of species migrating into their community from below. This is a useful approximation of some of the scenarios that are already being created by the unequal responses of species to climate and the creation of novel communities. One limitation of the study by Alexander et al. (2015) is the omission of the earliest phases of establishment when processes such as dispersal and germination are crucial in the encroachment of initial populations of migrant species into the new locations (Hampe, 2011). In particular, the experimental set up fails to account for one of the potentially most important drivers of community assembly—priority effects. Priority effects refer to the observation that early colonists will often inhibit, or alternatively facilitate, the establishment of subsequent colonizers (Connell and Slatyer, 1977). The concept of priority effect has been assimilated into community assembly theory to explain the fact that some communities may exist in alternative stable states depending on the timing and order of the arriving species and their traits, such as competitive ability or fecundity (Young et al., 2001). Priority effects can facilitate establishment of new species through changes in the environment or mutualisms. For example, in alpine communities, cushion plants can ameliorate environmental conditions and thereby increase the survival of other species leading to higher species richness (Cavieres et al., 2014). On the other hand, inhibitory priority effects can occur through legacies in the plant-soil feedbacks (Grman and Suding, 2010) or size-mediated priority effects and asymmetric competition (Weiner, 1990; Rasmussen et …",723f483e2eabd13a370f648f889ade65ec5f1e50,,0
https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI14497,"It infects me, it infects me not: phenotypic switching in the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans.","Phenotypic switching has been observed in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and involves stochastic switching between two or more alternative and heritable phenotypes, usually distinguished by surface antigenicity. This strategy, generally adopted by pathogens to escape recognition by the immune system and to adapt to a hostile host environment, results from spontaneous alterations in gene expression that arise at frequencies higher than standard spontaneous mutation rates. It differs from random spontaneous mutations that lead to phenotypic changes in individual cells in that it is reversible and readily detectable in a fraction of a cell population. Although phenotypic switching and filamentous dimorphic transitions in fungi are both reversible changes in gene expression that promote pathogenesis, phenotypic switching differs from fungal dimorphism in that the latter can occur in entire cell populations. 
 
The basis and outcomes of phenotypic evolution of parasites and pathogens have been monitored in serial passage experiments that are frequently used in vaccine development (1). Such passage involves serial and horizontal transfer of parasites from one host to another to achieve experimental evolution; evolved traits are then compared with those of the progenitor parasite. In general, within-host competition between strains drives an increase in virulence of the parasites in a new host but an attenuation of virulence in the former host. In this issue of the JCI, Fries et al. show for the first time that the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans can undergo phenotypic switching in vivo during passage in mice (2). Here, we present the current knowledge of phenotypic switching phenomena in this fungal pathogen. 
 
C. neoformans is an encapsulated yeast that causes fatal meningitis in immunocompromised humans. The ability of this organism to cause chronic infections even after prolonged antifungal drug therapy may be in part attributable to phenotypic switching in this pathogen, rather than strictly a function of host immune function (3). Several lines of evidence had indicated that C. neoformans undergoes phenotypic switching in vitro and in vivo. First, relapse of cryptococcal meningitis results during persistent infection with a single infecting strain rather than reinfection with a new strain (4, 5). Second, serial Cryptococcus isolates from AIDS patients exhibit minor electrophoretic karyotype changes due to chromosome length polymorphisms, and they can differ in in vitro growth rates, capsule size, or virulence in mice (3). Additional changes that occur during chronic infection include stable alterations in cell membrane sterol composition and differences in the glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) structure of the capsule (6). Third, analysis of a standard strain maintained in various laboratories reveals significant differences in capsule size, melanin production, growth rates, and virulence in mice (7). Fourth, reversible switching between various colony morphologies (smooth, wrinkled, and pseudohyphal) has been observed in three strains including two serotypes (8, 9). This colony-type switching is associated with changes in virulence and in host inflammatory and antibody responses in rats. Switching to colony types that elicit minimal inflammation has therefore been proposed as a mechanism for persistent infection. The frequency of colony-type switching is as high as 1 in 1000 to 1 in 100,000 cells, and variant colony morphology has been associated with altered cellular packing in the colony and quantitative and qualitative differences in capsular polysaccharide. 
 
A caveat not to be ignored is that the signs of switching may be subtle and need not always produce readily apparent colony phenotypes. To conclusively demonstrate in vivo phenotypic switching, Fries et al. used inoculum sizes that precluded in vitro switched variants and showed that switching from a smooth to a mucoid phenotype occurred in two mouse strains (2). Switching was also associated with the production of a different antiphagocytic capsular polysaccharide and consequently increased virulence. 
 
The environmental signals and mechanisms of phenotypic switching in C. neoformans remain largely unknown. No significant differences have been found in antifungal drug susceptibility of serial or relapse isolates, suggesting that drug resistance is not the main cause of persistent infection (10). Although phenotypic switching results in multiple phenotypes, karyotypic variability cannot always be linked to specific colony morphologies (9). In other pathogens, phenotypic switching is mediated by a variety of mechanisms, including transposition of mobile sequences, silencing of gene expression, activation of mutator genes, and rearrangement of repetitive DNA elements (11). For one switching C. neoformans strain, no DNA rearrangements involving C. neoformans repetitive element-1 (CNRE-1) were detected, although the possibility of rearrangement of other more recently discovered repetitive sequences could not be excluded (12). Phenotypic switching in C. neoformans could involve expansion or contraction of simple repetitive DNA sequences, as is observed in bacteria (13–15), or could involve epigenetic phenomena such as silencing and altered chromatin structure, as reported for the mating-type cassettes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (16). 
 
The pathogenic yeast Candida albicans has a switching system similar to that observed in C. neoformans. Phenotypic switching produces colony types reflecting dramatic differences in cellular architecture rather than antigenicity. Additionally, colony variants differ in virulence traits such as adherence to epithelial cells, protease production, and susceptibility to neutrophil-mediated killing, as well as antifungal drug susceptibility (17). The pleiotropic effect of switching has been shown to be due to differential gene expression and appears more likely due to a change at a key regulatory site, rather than spontaneous, independent changes at unlinked loci. One such candidate is the SIR2 gene, because a homozygous sir2/sir2 mutant strain exhibits dramatically increased colony switching and karyotype variability, suggesting that phenotypic switching is controlled by genes involved in silencing (18). Additional switch control genes identified include EFG1, encoding a transcription factor also required for filamentation (19), and the histone deacetylase genes HDA1 and RPD3 that play distinct roles in the suppression of switching and are in turn controlled transcriptionally by switching (20). 
 
In conclusion, Cryptococcus researchers may find important clues to the mechanisms of phenotypic switching by using the information available from C. albicans as a guide. Unraveling the regulatory circuits involved in phenotypic switching in C. neoformans will require isolation and characterization of genes involved in this process. Although such studies may be hampered by the stochastic nature of phenotypic switching, a clear understanding of the mechanics of this process may be useful in devising effective strategies to control the blight of switching fungal pathogens.",72490a03524bd590d1b84cfcec8a7821b8f47753,,0

https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.12238,Evolutionary applications research highlight for issue 1,"As we highlight each month in this section, the application of evolutionary theory to issues affecting the health and well-being of human, agricultural, and natural populations is gaining increasing momentum. In a recent review article written for Science, Scott Carroll et al. take on the now monumental task of synthesizing the many ways that evolutionary biology can be used to address global challenges (Carroll et al. 2014). They comprehensively explore the main problems being tackled with an evolutionary approach, ranging from populations evolving too quickly (such as emerging pathogens or pests evolving resistance to treatment) to populations not evolving quickly enough (for example those being negatively affected by human-mediated change). 
 
The authors begin by identifying what they see as the two key paradigms of applied evolutionary biology: (i) managing contemporary evolution (i.e., manipulating the rapid evolutionary response of short-lived organisms with large population sizes, such as bacterial pathogens) and (ii) altering the phenotype–environment mismatch (i.e., responding to populations of long-lived organisms such as trees that are no longer well adapted to their local environment due to shifts in climatic conditions or changes in biotic interactions). As a great example of such a mismatch, the authors highlight the increasing rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease in the human populations as a result of a more sedentary lifestyle with diets rich in sugars and fat. They then identify a number of promising research avenues that either have addressed or have the potential to address current global challenges, covering a wide range of approaches including the use of genetic engineering to more appropriately match genomes to their environment, the use of ‘refuges’ in agriculture and combination treatments against pests and pathogens to hinder the evolution of resistance, and introducing nonlocal genotypes which are predicted to perform better under given environmental conditions into natural populations to increase local adaptation. 
 
The article nicely separates these conceptual approaches into strategies for slowing unwanted evolution or directly influencing fitness of pests and pathogens, strategies for reducing the mismatch between phenotype and the local environment, and strategies for increasing group performance by selecting on group-level traits. For example, the authors discuss the success of artificially selecting for group yield in agricultural plots rather than individual fitness as a means for decreasing competition among plants. Critically, the piece also emphasizes the need to take a unified approach in meeting international objectives for sustainable development and suggests a need for stricter enforcement of guidelines in order to ensure best practice is achieved despite temptation to put profit or immediate success ahead of sustainable solutions.

Here, we establish a method for high-throughput phenotyping of mixed cultures, in which the pattern of naturally occurring single-nucleotide polymorphisms in each isolate is used as intrinsic barcodes which can be read out by sequencing. We demonstrate that our method can correctly deconvolute strain proportions in simulated mixed-strain pools. As an experimental test of our method, we perform whole genome sequencing of 66 natural isolates of the thermally dimorphic pathogenic fungus Coccidioides posadasii and infer the strain compositions for large mixed pools of these strains after competition at 37°C and room temperature. We validate the results of these selection experiments by recapitulating the temperature-specific enrichment results in smaller pools. Additionally, we demonstrate that strain fitness estimated by our method can be used as a quantitative trait for genome-wide association studies. We anticipate that our method will be broadly applicable to natural populations of microbes and allow high-throughput phenotyping to match the rate of genomic data acquisition. Author summary The diversity of the gene pool in natural populations encodes a wealth of information about its molecular biology. This is an especially valuable resource for non-model organisms, from humans to many microbial pathogens, lacking traditional genetic approaches. An effective method for reading out this population genetic information is a genome wide association study (GWAS) which searches for genotypes correlated with a phenotype of interest. With the advent of cheap genotyping, high throughput phenotyping is the primary bottleneck for GWAS, particularly for microbes that are difficult to manipulate. Here, we take advantage of the fact that the naturally occurring genetic variation within each individual strain can be used as an intrinsic barcode, which can be used to read out relative abundance of each strain as a quantitative phenotype from a mixed culture. Coccidioides posadasii, the causative agent of Valley Fever, is a fungal pathogen that must be manipulated under biosafety level 3 conditions, precluding many high-throughput phenotyping approaches. We apply our method to pooled competitions of C. posadasii strains at environmental and host temperatures. We identify robustly growing and temperature-sensitive strains, confirm these inferences in validation pooled growth experiments, and successfully demonstrate their use in GWAS.",76f0245d6de36968ca830ea2d1c413059f04f98b,,0
https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aau9460,Herbivores as drivers of negative density dependence in tropical forest saplings,"Herbivores shape tropical forests In tropical forests, high local tree diversity is driven by negative density dependence, a process whereby plant performance is inhibited by closely related neighbors. Negative density dependence could be caused by competition for resources among neighbors or result from shared herbivores and pathogens. Using data from forest plots in Panama, Forrister et al. compared the contributions of these mechanisms. They found no effect of competition, but strong effects of plant chemistry and shared herbivores on coexisting Inga tree species. Science, this issue p. 1213 Damage to saplings by herbivores rather than resource competition maintains local tree diversity in tropical rainforests. Ecological theory predicts that the high local diversity observed in tropical forests is maintained by negative density–dependent interactions within and between closely related plant species. By using long-term data on tree growth and survival for coexisting Inga (Fabaceae, Mimosoideae) congeners, we tested two mechanisms thought to underlie negative density dependence (NDD): competition for resources and attack by herbivores. We quantified the similarity of neighbors in terms of key ecological traits that mediate these interactions, as well as the similarity of herbivore communities. We show that phytochemical similarity and shared herbivore communities are associated with decreased growth and survival at the sapling stage, a key bottleneck in the life cycle of tropical trees. None of the traits associated with resource acquisition affect plant performance, indicating that competition between neighbors may not shape local tree diversity. These results suggest that herbivore pressure is the primary mechanism driving NDD at the sapling stage.",7798c03cafa9bfbb11500d17b9682d26f2a55558,,0

This study was conducted in Moso bamboo plantations in Zhejiang Province, China. We measured rhizome-system absorptive roots, leaf properties, and soil nutrient contents to explore acquisition-resorption relationships. We also examined how management practices (abandonment [AM], conventional biennial [CM], and high-intensity annual plus understory planting [HM]) influence the traits and processes in Moso bamboo forests. Key novel findings include: (1) A consistent trade-off emerged for nitrogen [N] (negative relationships between root N absorption and leaf N resorption) but not phosphorus [P]. (2) Principal component analysis revealed root traits economics structured along two axes: first (PC1), specific root length [SRL]and root tissue density [RTD] (root lifespan) and second (PC2), cortex thickness [CT] and branching intensity [BI] (fungal independence). Interestingly, the PC1 was positively correlated with N absorption potential, and negatively correlated with N resorption efficiency. (3) HM significantly enhanced SRL (+75% vs. CM) and resorption efficiency (+23% for N, +37% for P), likely driven by interspecific competition under herb planting.

This realisation has fuelled great interest in the effects of microbes on the health of plant [1–3] and animal hosts [4–6] and has revealed that microbe-mediated protection against infectious disease is a widespread phenomenon (Table 1) [7–11]. Defensive microbes can protect hosts from infection by parasites (including pathogens and parasitoids) by direct or host-mediated means (Box 1). Such protective traits have made these microbes attractive candidates for disease control. In fact, defensive microbes are already being applied in phage therapy and bacteriotherapy for humans, as well as to control vector-borne and agricultural diseases (Table 2). 
 
 
Box 1. Mechanisms of Defensive Microbes 
Direct 
Hyperparasitism or predation: Microbes can parasitise or predate upon the parasite [39]. 
 
Interference competition: Microbes can produce toxic compounds, such as antibiotics or bacteriocins, that may either kill the parasite or reduce its growth rate [40–42]. 
 
Resource competition: Microbes can compete with parasites for host resources [10,42], usually via the rate of resource acquisition [40,41]. 
 
 
Host-mediated 
Host immune-mediation: Microbes can elicit a host immune response to which the parasite is not resistant [40,42]. 
 
Host tolerance-mediation: Microbes can increase the fitness of their host during infection without reducing the fitness of the parasite by enhancing host tolerance (e.g., via tissue damage prevention and/or repair) [43,44].

This will not only shape how we understand patterns of host–parasite coevolution in nature but will inform our decisisons in utilising defensive microbes as disease control agents.

1. Resource availability can influence the structure of animal communities by mediating competitive interactions. An underappreciated aspect of resource ecology is how functional traits are built from particular sets of nutrients and thus are underexpressed when those nutrients are scarce.

2. One idea linking resource availability to competition is the metabolic fuel hypothesis, which posits that access to carbohydrate-rich resources favours high activity rates that increase competitive prowess. One prediction of this hypothesis is that an increase in dietary carbohydrate richness will lead to an increase in consumer metabolic rate (MR). An alternative prediction is that carbohydrate-rich diets will affect biochemical storage.

3. We tested these predictions by examining the effect of dietary protein : carbohydrate (P : C) ratio on the feeding behaviour, demography, physiology and MR of colonies of Ectatomma ruidum, a common tropical ant. We found that rearing colonies for 6 weeks on different P : C diets altered colony demography and worker storage biochemistry, but higher carbohydrate intake did not result in an increase in whole-colony MR.

4. Our results suggest that dietary carbohydrates may increase colony dominance through changes in colony composition and individual worker longevity rather than changes in worker activity rates. More generally, they illustrate how the identity of scarce nutrients can have particular effects on traits that impact ecological interactions.",7e1878ef5524d9eca8b5aedbd0448780d08d5466,,0

We know now from theory and work in experimental and model systems that these processes can feed back on each other on mutually relevant time‐scales. Here, we present evidence of a soil‐mediated eco‐evolutionary feedback on the population dynamics of an invasive biennial plant, Alliaria petiolata. As populations age, natural selection drives down production of A. petiolata's important antimycorrhizal allelochemical, sinigrin. This occurs due to density‐dependent selection on sinigrin, which is favoured under interspecific, but disfavoured under intraspecific, competition. We show that population stochastic growth rates (λS) and plant densities are positively related to sinigrin concentration measured in seedling roots. This interaction is mediated by sinigrin's positive effect on seedling and summer survival, which are important drivers of λS. Together, these illustrate how the evolution of a trait shaped by natural selection can influence the ecology of a species over a period of just years to decades, altering its trajectory of population growth and interactions with the species in the soil and plant communities it invades. Our findings confirm the predictions that eco‐evolutionary feedbacks occur in natural populations. Furthermore, they improve our conceptual framework for projecting future population growth by linking the variation in plant demography to a critical competitive trait (sinigrin) whose selective advantages decrease as populations age.",7efe0009bcb665ffca2a364f3430092f6af0d834,,0
https://doi.org/10.1071/BT07150,Plant trait–environmental linkages among contrasting landscapes and climate regimes in temperate eucalypt woodlands,"Ecological sorting of species along climate and landscape gradients is a fundamental global pattern. However, the extent to which functional traits reflect floristic turnover in response to interactions between climate and landscape gradients is rarely assessed. We tested whether floristic variation among sites within a bioregion was more strongly correlated with soil fertility or climate. We then examined the relationship between floristic composition, environment and the co-variation of selected vegetative and regenerative functional traits. This allowed us to assess the ecological sorting of species along soil fertility and rainfall gradients and to detect any resource compensation effects via interactions between these factors. Floristic differences were equally associated with soil fertility and climate contrasts but species' trait patterns were more strongly associated with soil fertility than rainfall. No interactive effects, which would suggest resource compensation, were detected. Instead, more fertile sites consistently had more forbs, annuals and grasses in comparison with less fertile sites which were dominated by woody species and had a higher abundance of graminoids. Three broad mechanisms for sorting of species based on trait patterns are proposed (1) differences in the fundamental regenerative and growth niche, (2) resource competition during establishment and (3) disturbance-mediated sorting.",80384dd5dda3fe66a3debb6d2b9f447c2df701b4,,0

Often very abrupt boundaries form between these two habitats, giving rise to a mosaic pattern of contrasting shrub-grass alterations across the landscape. Reasons for such patterning remain poorly understood though current niche-based views relate species' distributions to spatial resource gradients or to fire effects. Field survey work was conducted on central Australian mountain ranges to further quantify floristic, regeneration traits, and structural patterning across mulga-spinifex transitions and to test resource- and disturbance-models that explain these patterns. Compositional analysis demonstrated variability in transition type - in certain cases boundaries denoted true floristic discontinuity and in others, somewhat more of a structural shift. Moreover, it was shown that minimal between-habitat floristic overlap coincided with the occurrence of distinct edaphic changes, while greater compositional commonality occurred when soil gradients were more diffuse.This indicated that floristic patterning cannot be ascribed to any one single process. In the case of strong soil gradients, between-habitat segregation most likely resulted from resource-based niche differentiation; for weaker gradients, fire-frequency assumed greatest importance. Disturbance theory most readily accounted for the distribution of woody species' post-fire regeneration traits across habitat boundaries.The results also suggested that biotic factors - viz competition, facilitation and animal-mediated dispersal - may be of additional consequence for mulga- spinifex coexistence. Overall, the study served to emphasize the importance of multi-factor explanation for within- and between-habitat patterning in these mosaics. It also highlighted the need for experimentation to facilitate distinction between cause and correlation.",81f5afbcb580c40d46b387928035da13f652752d,,0

https://doi.org/10.3732/ajb.1300064,Water-use efficiency and relative growth rate mediate competitive interactions in Sonoran Desert winter annual plants.,"UNLABELLED



PREMISE OF THE STUDY
A functional approach to investigating competitive interactions can provide a mechanistic understanding of processes driving population dynamics, community assembly, and the maintenance of biodiversity. In Sonoran Desert annual plants, a trade-off between relative growth rate (RGR) and water-use efficiency (WUE) contributes to species differences in population dynamics that promote long-term coexistence. Traits underlying this trade-off explain variation in demographic responses to precipitation as well as life history and phenological patterns. Here, we ask how these traits mediate competitive interactions. •


METHODS
We conducted competition trials for three species occupying different positions along the RGR-WUE trade-off axis and compared the effects of competition at high and low soil moisture. We compared competitive effect (ability to suppress neighbors) and competitive response (ability to withstand competition from neighbors) among species. •


KEY RESULTS
The RGR-WUE trade-off predicted shifts in competitive responses at different soil moistures. The high-RGR species was more resistant to competition in high water conditions, while the opposite was true for the high-WUE species. The intermediate RGR species tended to have the strongest impact on all neighbors, so competitive effects did not scale directly with differences in RGR and WUE among competitors. •


CONCLUSIONS
Our results reveal mechanisms underlying long-term variation in fitness: high-RGR species perform better in years with large, frequent rain events and can better withstand competition under wetter conditions. The opposite is true for high-WUE species. Such resource-dependent responses strongly influence community dynamics and can promote coexistence in variable environments.",87629046a20f382fa457569382ca6fe419a1045b,,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.17037,Competition-induced transgenerational plasticity influences competitive interactions and leaf decomposition of offspring.,"Phenotypic plasticity, within and across generations (transgenerational plasticity), allows organisms and their progeny to adapt to the environment without modification of the underlying DNA. Recent findings suggest that epigenetic modifications are important mediators of such plasticity. However, empirical studies have, so far, mainly focused on plasticity in response to abiotic factors, overlooking the response to competition. We tested for within-generation and transgenerational phenotypic plasticity triggered by plant-plant competition intensity, and tested whether it was mediated via DNA methylation, using the perennial, apomictic herb Taraxacum brevicorniculatum in four coordinated experiments. We then tested the consequences of transgenerational plasticity affecting competitive interactions of the offspring and ecosystem processes such as decomposition. We found that, by promoting differences in DNA methylation, offspring of plants under stronger competition developed faster and presented more resource-conservative phenotypes. Further, these adjustments associated with less degradable leaves which have the potential to reduce nutrient turnover and might, in turn, favour plants with more conservative traits. Greater parental competition enhanced competitive abilities of the offspring by triggering adaptive phenotypic plasticity, and decreased offspring leaf decomposability. Our results suggest that competition-induced transgenerational effects could promote rapid adaptations and species coexistence, and feed back on biodiversity assembly and nutrient cycling.",880647bcc951344f5d6d6ae7beb830838e0aff06,,0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-022-05269-7,Social context mediates the expression of a personality trait in a gregarious lizard,"The social environment is a key factor that influences behavioural traits across a wide array of species. Yet, when investigating individual differences in behaviour, studies tend to measure animals in isolation from other conspecifics—even in social species. Surprisingly, whether behavioural traits measured in isolation are predictive of individual-level behaviour when in social groups is still poorly understood. Here, we repeatedly measured risk-taking behaviour (i.e. boldness; 741 total trials) in both the presence and absence of conspecifics in a social lizard, the delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata). Further, we manipulated food availability during group trials to test whether the effect of the social environment on risk-taking behaviour was mediated by competition over resources. Using 105 lizards collected from three independent populations, we found that individual risk-taking behaviour was repeatable when measured in either social isolation or within groups both with and without food resources available. However, lizards that were bolder during individual trials were not also bolder when in groups, regardless of resource availability. This was largely driven by individual differences in social behavioural plasticity, whereby individual skinks responded differently to the presence of conspecifics. Together, this resulted in a rank order change of individual behavioural types across the social conditions. Our results highlight the importance of the social environment in mediating animal personality traits across varying levels of resource availability. Further, these findings suggest that behavioural traits when measured in isolation, may not reflect individual variation in behaviour when measured in more ecologically realistic social groups.",8851190ab39fe9072d84202912196e7e0f39bafe,,0

To navigate this challenge, the institution aims to establish a competitive edge by adopting the resource-based view theory. This strategic approach emphasizes the unique qualities of the institution's resources, with human capital emerging as the most pivotal. This study involves 120 respondents, exploring the influence of Big Five personality traits, organizational commitment, and attitude toward digital work on employee performance. Using the partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) method, the findings indicate that the Big Five personality traits insignificantly impact employee performance. The Big Five personality traits significantly impact organizational commitment, and organizational commitment significantly impacts employee performance, in which the organizational commitment serves as a complete mediation. In addition, attitudes towards digital work as quasi-moderating can strengthen the influence of the Big Five personality traits on employee performance. Further research is recommended to analyze the relationship between the dimensions of each variable in more depth. Keywords: Big five personality traits, Organizational commitment, Attitude toward digital work, Employee performance",8a8ded282c559710f84ac3589d59bcc6791859d6,,0

Less known is whether interspecific synchrony of seed rain can alter the indirect interactions of sympatric tree species. We assessed the seed dispersal success by tracking the fates of 21 600 tagged seeds from six paired sympatric tree species in both monospecific and mixed plots across 4 successive years in a subtropical forest. We found that apparent mutualism was associated with the interspecific synchrony of seed rain both seasonally and yearly, whereas apparent competition or apparent predation was associated with interspecific asynchrony of seed rain either seasonally or yearly. We did not find consistent associations of indirect interactions with seed traits. Our study suggests that the interspecific synchrony of seed rain plays a key role in the formation of animal‐mediated indirect interactions, which, in turn, may alter the seasonal or yearly seed rain schedules of sympatric tree species.",8abd7ce1b57d1a164107463b7235347d427f8fd0,,0

Spotless starling males (Sturnus unicolor) carry green plants into their nests before egg laying, and recent studies have shown that this behaviour is related to female breeding decisions and the production of male-biased broods. Although the functional implications of this effect on females are not yet clear, data suggest that it could be mediated by female circulating hormones. Additionally, females may show higher androgen levels as a consequence of the increased female‐female competition generated by the increase in male attractiveness. We tested this hypothesis using the same manipulation of green nesting material that has been previously shown to result in an increase of male attractiveness in male spotless starlings. We found that females in experimental nests increased their circulating testosterone levels during the laying period. In addition, there was an increase of social interferences in the experimental nests because of the addition of green plants. We hypothesise that testosterone may allow females to maintain their mating status when competing with other females for the preferred males. Addition of green plants also increased the variance in the levels of circulating testosterone, suggesting plasticity between females in their response to the manipulation. We propose that there is a functional link between high testosterone levels, male-biased sex ratios and female resource-holding potential in intra-sexual competition in this species.",8af867ffbb9a20ec6bc2ba82abeff3b70883c07c,,0

https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00497,"When, where and how does microbial community composition matter?","Our planet is experiencing rates of environmental change unprecedented in modern times, and an understanding of how microbes both mediate and respond to these shifts is an important research challenge (De Vries and Shade, 2013). Because of the temporal and spatial scales over which microbes function as well as their extreme diversity, dynamics in microbial structure and processes are typically examined at the community level. However, the factors that drive patterns in microbial structure and function, and the links between them, remain widely debated (Prosser et al., 2007). In this issue, such patterns in microbial communities are further documented for soils, lakes, streams and ocean provinces (Arnosti et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2012; King et al., 2012; Larouche et al., 2012). Additionally, the importance of spatial and temporal dynamics (Armitage et al., 2012; Arnosti et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2012; Larouche et al., 2012) and interactions with macrobiota (King et al., 2012) in driving these patterns is demonstrated. Yet, a central but unanswered question is: “does knowing who is there help us to better understand what they are doing?” Indeed, as shown here by Salles et al. (2012), links between structure and function can often be weak, both at the level of the individual and at the level of the community. Several papers in this special issue, “The Causes and Consequences of Microbial Community Structure,” use empirical or modeling approaches as well as literature reviews to enrich our mechanistic understanding of the controls over the relationship between community structure and ecosystem processes. Specifically, authors address the role of trait distributions and trade-offs, species-species interactions, evolutionary dynamics, community assembly processes and physical controls in affecting “who's there” and “what they are doing.” 
 
Trait-based approaches can provide mechanistic links between community structure and function, and are gaining popularity in microbial ecology (Krause et al., 2014). Importantly, the distribution of traits within a community may affect the relationship between structure and function (Webb et al., 2010). Thus, as highlighted in this issue by Comte et al. (2013), traits can be considered at both the individual and the community level, where trait distributions may have important implications for emergent properties (e.g., redundancy). Indeed, Shade et al. (2012) highlight a variety of traits that may govern the stability of individual organisms, populations and communities including plasticity, tolerance and dormancy. Folse and Allison (2012) used a multi-nutrient, multi-genotype model of enzyme activity, and showed that trait distributions could yield insight into the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function. They found that generalists dominated at low levels of community diversity when rates of enzyme production and enzyme diffusion were lowest. Matias et al. (2013) used a simple microcosm experiment and examined the response of assembled communities to fluctuations in salinity. Their results were somewhat different from Folse and Allison (2012), as they found that community diversity was positively related to productivity and that generalists were more productive and less variable over time. Their work also showed that there did not appear to be a fitness trade-off associated with generalization. Comte et al. (2013) took a novel approach to examine plasticity and redundancy in freshwater bacterioplankton communities, and described explicit metrics to track these traits within community transplant experiments. They showed that plasticity appeared to be an intrinsic community property while redundancy was affected by external environmental factors. Their work also revealed strong relationships between community plasticity and redundancy, with no evidence for trade-offs and a possible co-selection of these attributes. 
 
As well, species-species interactions can affect the relationship between communities and processes. In the model presented by Folse and Allison (2012), the importance of both “coalitions” of complementary organisms and the abundance of “cheaters,” or organisms that use a public good without contributing to its production, increased under high levels of enzyme production. They also found that the presence of cheaters could affect the relationship between biodiversity and function. Fox (2012) offered a cautionary tale in terms of our ability to interpret relationships between abundance and “adaptedness” because of organismal interactions. He used a consumer-resource model to demonstrate that, at medium levels of niche overlap, outcomes of competition can be unpredictable, decoupling relationships between abundance and adaptation. 
 
Evolutionary dynamics can also alter relationships between structure and function. In a Perspectives Article, Choudoir et al. (2012) advocate for population-level approaches to examining microbial community diversity, emphasizing that organisms with exactly the same 16S rRNA gene sequence can exhibit very different ecological dynamics. Indeed, Salles et al. (2012) examined the links between rates of denitrification and phylogenies and highlighted the potential importance of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) by showing that similarity in nirK genes, which are thought to be subject to HGT, is not related to N2O accumulation rates. Furthermore, for nirS and 16S rRNA genes, Salles et al. (2012) showed that there was more explanatory power between structure and function at finer scales of phylogenetic resolution for denitrification and metabolic profiles respectively. Pearce et al. (2012) used metagenomics to examine a soil microbial community from Mars Oasis, Antarctica, and showed that while genera-level diversity was limited, species-level diversity was high. They proposed that this suggests strong selection on the types of taxa that can inhabit this extreme environment combined with high rates of diversification within those lineages. Related, Knope et al. (2012) used a microcosm approach to examine the importance of evolutionary history for diversification in bacteria. They showed that prior exposure to an environmental challenge led to higher rates of diversification. These studies suggest that understanding the coupling of ecological and evolutionary processes is key for interpreting microbial community patterns of structure and function. 
 
Community assembly processes may also alter the relationship between “who's there” and “what they do” (Nemergut et al., 2013). Knope et al. (2012) found that arriving in a community first led to a greater degree of diversification within bacteria, likely because of niche-preemption. Pholchan et al. (2013) used a variety of manipulations to alter microbial community assembly in sludge reactors and showed that relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function in these systems were unpredictable. They hypothesized that the relative importance of stochastic vs. deterministic assembly processes could change the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function. In their comment on the Pholchan manuscript, Knelman and Nemergut (2014) provide a conceptual framework illustrating how assembly, biodiversity and function may be related. Together, these studies provide growing evidence for the importance of assembly processes in determining microbial community properties. 
 
Physical dynamics may also be key in regulating the relationship between structure and function. Schimel and Schaeffer (2012) propose a conceptual framework that highlights a requirement that biological processes need to be rate limiting or fate determining in order for community structure to matter for ecosystem function. For example, they propose that structure is not likely to be relevant for organic matter breakdown in mineral soils, where diffusion is limited and organic particles may be occluded or sorbed to soil surfaces. Likewise, Folse and Allison (2012) demonstrate that rates of diffusion of enzymes can affect community diversity and the relative proportion of generalists to specialists. Their work also showed high rates of diffusion coupled to high rates of production can lead to community bottlenecks and increases in stochasticity. As well, King et al. (2012) found that physical dynamics may also affect biotic relationships. They found that associations between plants and microbial community composition were less pronounced at higher elevations, likely due to an increase in the influence of physical harshness on community composition. 
 
Together, the studies in this special issue highlight the role of a variety of ecological, evolutionary and physical dynamics in microbial community structure and function (Figure ​(Figure1).1). This body of work emphasizes the importance of emergent, aggregate community properties and the role of community dynamics in variations in the strength of the structure-function relationships. As Schimel wrote in 1995 “At a small enough scale, microbial community structure must be a dominant control on ecological processes, but as we move up in scale toward the ecosystem and integrate across many individual communities, the influence of microbial community structures decreases.” Predicting when, where, how, and at what scale microbial communities may respond to environmental changes remains a research priority and these papers present new insights into this challenge.

Its comparative analysis may reveal insight on what shapes shape, being a useful approach when other evidence is lacking. Here we investigated evolutionary patterns of body shape in the highly diverse phytophagous chafers (Scarabaeidae: Pleurosticti), a polyphagous group utilizing different parts of angiosperms. Because the reasons of their successful diversification are largely unknown, we used a phylogenetic tree and multivariate analysis on twenty linear measurements of body morphology including all major Pleurosticti lineages to infer patterns of morphospace covariation and divergence. The chafer's different feeding types resulted to be not distinguishable in the described morphospace which was largely attributed to large occupancy of the morphospace of some feeding types and to multiple convergences of feeding behavior (particularly of anthophagy). Low correlation between molecular and morphological rates of evolution, including significant rate shifts for some lineages, indicated directed selection within feeding types. This is supported by morphospace divergence within feeding types and convergent evolution in Australian Melolonthinae. Traits driving morphospace divergence were extremities and traits linked with locomotion behavior, but also body size. Being highly adaptive for burrowing and locomotion these traits showed major changes in the evolution of pleurostict scarabs. These activities also affected another trait, the metacoxal length, which is highly influenced by key innovations of the metacoxa (extended mesal process, secondary closure) particularly in one lineage, the Sericini. Significant shape divergence between major lineages and a lack of strong differentiation among closely related lineages indicated that the question about the presence or absence of competition-derived directed selection needs to be addressed for different time scales. Striking divergence between some sister lineages at their origin revealed strong driven selection towards morphospace divergence, possibly linked with resource partitioning.",8f995ca8f520dbe5ef3c6c20ca7495a5514467aa,,0

https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.0504,Trait-mediated competition drives an ant invasion and alters functional diversity,"The assumption that differences in species' traits reflect their different niches has long influenced how ecologists infer processes from assemblage patterns. For instance, many assess the importance of environmental filtering versus classical limiting-similarity competition in driving biological invasions by examining whether invaders’ traits are similar or dissimilar to those of residents, respectively. However, mounting evidence suggests that hierarchical differences between species' trait values can distinguish their competitive abilities (e.g. for the same resource) instead of their niches. Whether such trait-mediated hierarchical competition explains invasions and structures assemblages is less explored. We integrate morphological, dietary, physiological and behavioural trait analyses to test whether environmental filtering, limiting-similarity competition or hierarchical competition explain invasions by fire ants on ant assemblages. We detect both competition mechanisms; invasion success is not only explained by limiting similarity in body size and thermal tolerance (presumably allowing the invader to exploit different niches from residents), but also by the invader's superior position in trait hierarchies reflecting competition for common trophic resources. We find that the two mechanisms generate complex assemblage-level functional diversity patterns—overdispersion in some traits, clustering in others—suggesting their effects are likely missed by analyses restricted to a few traits and composite trait diversity measures.",90c4b430f2d78721be333de757c02376e3d42156,,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.10596,Selection for domestication favored taxa characterized by fast growth and tolerance of high intraspecific density,"To understand why certain plants have been domesticated into crops, we need to recognize that the environmental conditions plants experience in wild populations are totally different from those of agricultural fields. In this study, we investigated whether the characteristics that promote growth and survival in these different environments may have influenced domestication. Our results revealed that ancestral crops were selected because they developed better than other plants in dense single‐species stands, with selection for increased yield likely occurring after domestication. These insights shed light on the origins of agriculture and offer valuable guidance for future crop breeding efforts.

In spite of a large history of research, it is still unclear which functional traits may have mediated plant domestication. Solving this problem requires consideration of the ecological and demographic disparities between natural plant populations and cultivated fields. Since population density tends to be higher in the latter, we hypothesized that traits facilitating growth and survival in dense, monospecific populations might have been relevant for initial domestication.
We investigated whether functional traits that respond to population density varied across three different domestication stages: undomesticated crop wild relatives, natural populations of crop progenitors, and landraces. To do this, we compared traits influencing competition (lodging; growth rate), resource acquisition (plant height; total aerial and root biomass) and yield (fruit number) in three annual legume crops—lentil, grasspea, and vetch—grown without resource limitation at three different densities.
Our results showed clear differences among species, likely reflective of the distinct uses of the crops and their domestication pathways. Nevertheless, undomesticated relatives consistently differed from crop progenitors and landraces, producing smaller, slower‐growing plants that were more prostrate and allocated less biomass to roots. The effect of selection under domestication on these vegetative traits appeared to be largely negligible. Conversely, landraces produced more fruits.
We conclude that early agriculturalists selected for domestication wild legumes that performed well in dense monocultures and were more effective in resource capture. Later domestication and breeding efforts likely had more significant effects on reproductive traits, such as fruit and seed production.

https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.1536,Chemical similarity and local community assembly in the species rich tropical genus Piper.,"Community ecologists have strived to find mechanisms that mediate the assembly of natural communities. Recent evidence suggests that natural enemies could play an important role in the assembly of hyper-diverse tropical plant systems. Classic ecological theory predicts that in order for coexistence to occur, species differences must be maximized across biologically important niche dimensions. For plant-herbivore interactions, it has been recently suggested that, within a particular community, plant species that maximize the difference in chemical defense profiles compared to neighboring taxa will have a relative competitive advantage. Here we tested the hypothesis that plant chemical diversity can affect local community composition in the hyper-diverse genus Piper at a lowland wet forest location in Costa Rica. We first characterized the chemical composition of 27 of the most locally abundant species of Piper. We then tested whether species with different chemical compositions were more likely to coexist. Finally, we assessed the degree to which Piper phylogenetic relationships are related to differences in secondary chemical composition and community assembly. We found that, on average, co-occurring species were more likely to differ in chemical composition than expected by chance. Contrary to expectations, there was no phylogenetic signal for overall secondary chemical composition. In addition we found that species in local communities were, on average, more phylogenetically closely related than expected by chance, suggesting that functional traits other than those measured here also influence local assembly. We propose that selection by herbivores for divergent chemistries between closely related species facilitates the coexistence of a high diversity of congeneric taxa via apparent competition.",941d0eae0f2d7257e4d3c8189b3e9698d445b0c1,,0

Intraspecific variation in metabolic rates and, hence, resource demands covary with competitive ability. The effects of metabolism on conspecific interactions, however, have mostly been studied under laboratory conditions. We used a trait‐specific response‐surface design to test for the effects of metabolism on pairwise interactions of the marine colonial invertebrate, Bugula neritina in the field. Specifically, we compared the performance (survival, growth, and reproduction) of focal individuals, both in the presence and absence of a neighbor colony, both of which had their metabolic phenotype characterized. Survival of focal colonies depended on the metabolic phenotype of the neighboring individual, and on the combination of both the focal and neighbor colony metabolic phenotypes that were present. Surprisingly, we found pervasive effects of neighbor metabolic phenotypes on focal colony growth and reproduction, although the sign and strength of these effects showed strong microenvironmental variability. Overall, we find that the metabolic phenotype changes the strength of competitive interactions, but these effects are highly contingent on local conditions. We suggest future studies explore how variation in metabolic rate affects organisms beyond the focal organism alone, particularly under field conditions.",96b991f5f881b2df26549d9ab2b1486a42ab5083,,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.610,Alternative trait combinations and secondary resource partitioning in sexually selected color polymorphism,"Resource partitioning within a species, trophic polymorphism is hypothesized to evolve by disruptive selection when intraspecific competition for certain resources is severe. However, in this study, we reported the secondary partitioning of oviposition resources without resource competition in the damselfly Ischnura senegalensis. In this species, females show color polymorphism that has been evolved as counteradaptation against sexual conflict. One of the female morphs is a blue-green (andromorph, male-like morph), whereas the other morph is brown (gynomorph). These female morphs showed alternative preferences for oviposition resources (plant tissues); andromorphs used fresh (greenish) plant tissues, whereas gynomorphs used decaying (brownish) plants tissues, suggesting that they chose oviposition resources on which they are more cryptic. In addition, the two-color morphs had different egg morphologies. Andromorphs have smaller and more elongated eggs, which seemed to adapt to hard substrates compared with those of gynomorphs. The resource partitioning in this species is achieved by morphological and behavioral differences between the color morphs that allow them to effectively exploit different resources. Resource partitioning in this system may be a by-product of phenotypic integration with body color that has been sexually selected, suggesting an overlooked mechanism of the evolution of resource partitioning. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary and ecological consequences of such resource partitioning.",96e78d06e4192f4eaface956259023e212fde680,,0
https://doi.org/10.1890/04-1249,RESOURCE COMPETITION MODIFIES THE STRENGTH OF TRAIT- MEDIATED PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS: A META-ANALYSIS,"Only a fraction of the individuals in a given prey population are likely to be killed and consumed by predators. In contrast, nearly all individuals experience the chronic effects of predation risk. When threatened by predators, prey adopt defensive tactics whose costs can lead to reduced growth, maturation rates, survivorship, fecundity, or pop- ulation density. This nonconsumptive impact of predation risk on prey is known as a ''trait- mediated interaction'' (TMI) because it results from changes in prey traits such as behavior or physiology. Ecological theory suggests that the strength of TMI effects will reflect a balance between the conflicting demands of reproduction vs. predator avoidance. Competitor density and resource availability are expected to alter the balance between these conflicting forces. We conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured TMI effect size while varying competitor and/or resource density. The threat of predation had an overall negative effect on prey performance, but the strength of this effect varied with the level of competition. High competition exacerbated the negative effect of intimidation on prey density but moderated the negative effect of intimidation on prey life history and growth. We discuss these results in light of previously published theoretical expectations. Our results highlight the variable and context-dependent nature of interspecific interactions.",970ddf8e9cc5c6ee0795cbf90ff98aec7e533baa,,0

https://doi.org/10.2307/3546993,Interspecific competition between two stream insect grazers mediated by non-feeding predatory fish.,"Two periphyton-grazing stream insects, a baetid mayfly and a glossosomatid caddisfly, were found to be strong exploitative competitors. The presence of predatory fish was found to alter the foraging activities of the baetid. but not of the glossosomatid. We investigated the local distribution of Baetis thermicus and Glossosoma sp. to examine the potential for competition between the two grazers in a northern Japanese stream. Further, we carried our a laboratory experiment to test the hypothesis that the freshwater sculpin Cottus nozawae, when not allowed to attack prey, mediates the resource-limited competitive influences of Baetly on the growth of Glossosoma, but not the reverse. We found a negative correlation between the densities of Baetis and Glossosoma in the stream, suggesting the strong potential for resource-limiting competitive interactions to occur between the grazers. Using a laboratory channel experiment employing a target-neighbor design, neither the presence of sculpin nor the density of the two grazers altered any life-history traits measured for the grazers. However, the proportion of Baetis individuals positioned on the upper surface of a ceramic plate substrate (with greater periphyton biomass) largely decreased in the presence of sculpin, with only a minor behavioral shift being detected in Glossasoma. This difference in behavioral shift resulted in greater growth suppression in Baetis than in Glossosoma. In the absence of sculpin, growth of both target grazers was lowered by experimentally increasing the density of neighboring competitors. In partial contradiction to the above hypothesis, the growth of not only Glossosoma but also Baetis was never influenced by the density of neighbor competitors when sculpin were present. The biomass of periphyton in the presence of sculpin was greater than when sculpin were absent, and was lower with higher densities of either grazer. Predator-avoidance behavioral modifications in both grazers may be the mechanism responsible for mediation of their exploitative competition.",9e32e71c362c248080ece942274758836312c27a,,0
https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13133324,Extracellular Vesicles as Mediators of Cancer Disease and as Nanosystems in Theranostic Applications,"Simple Summary Cancer is the second leading cause of death in humans, and in 2020, 9.8 million cancer-related deaths were reported worldwide. In the last 20 years, it has become apparent that small vesicles released by cancer cells, referred to as extracellular vesicles (EVs), are key players in cell–cell communication in the tumor environment, and as a consequence, research in this area has increased dramatically. This review summarizes the recent advances in our understanding of how EVs serve as mediators of communication between cancer cells and with their surroundings in order to promote the acquisition of specific characteristics that permit their aberrant behavior. In addition, we dwell on how EVs aid in the development of drug resistance, which is a frequent cause of treatment failure in chemotherapy. Finally, we discuss an exciting new area of research that envisions harnessing the unique characteristics of EVs for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes (theranostics). Taken together, the available literature suggests that advances in our understanding of EV biology in the next decades will likely be critical to achieving more effective treatments in cancer patients. Abstract Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide despite decades of intense efforts to understand the molecular underpinnings of the disease. To date, much of the focus in research has been on the cancer cells themselves and how they acquire specific traits during disease development and progression. However, these cells are known to secrete large numbers of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are now becoming recognized as key players in cancer. EVs contain a large number of different molecules, including but not limited to proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs, and they are actively secreted by many different cell types. In the last two decades, a considerable body of evidence has become available indicating that EVs play a very active role in cell communication. Cancer cells are heterogeneous, and recent evidence reveals that cancer cell-derived EV cargos can change the behavior of target cells. For instance, more aggressive cancer cells can transfer their “traits” to less aggressive cancer cells and convert them into more malignant tumor cells or, alternatively, eliminate those cells in a process referred to as “cell competition”. This review discusses how EVs participate in the multistep acquisition of specific traits developed by tumor cells, which are referred to as “the hallmarks of cancer” defined by Hanahan and Weinberg. Moreover, as will be discussed, EVs play an important role in drug resistance, and these more recent advances may explain, at least in part, why pharmacological therapies are often ineffective. Finally, we discuss literature proposing the use of EVs for therapeutic and prognostic purposes in cancer.",9e6c35c2d978b15e55ea2680baa0797cef96b639,,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jeb.12814,"Sex‐specific plasticity and genotype × sex interactions for age and size of maturity in the sheepshead swordtail, Xiphophorus birchmanni","Responses to sexually antagonistic selection are thought to be constrained by the shared genetic architecture of homologous male and female traits. Accordingly, adaptive sexual dimorphism depends on mechanisms such as genotype‐by‐sex interaction (G×S) and sex‐specific plasticity to alleviate this constraint. We tested these mechanisms in a population of Xiphophorus birchmanni (sheepshead swordtail), where the intensity of male competition is expected to mediate intersexual conflict over age and size at maturity. Combining quantitative genetics with density manipulations and analysis of sex ratio variation, we confirm that maturation traits are dimorphic and heritable, but also subject to large G×S. Although cross‐sex genetic correlations are close to zero, suggesting sex‐linked genes with important effects on growth and maturation are likely segregating in this population, we found less evidence of sex‐specific adaptive plasticity. At high density, there was a weak trend towards later and smaller maturation in both sexes. Effects of sex ratio were stronger and putatively adaptive in males but not in females. Males delay maturation in the presence of mature rivals, resulting in larger adult size with subsequent benefit to competitive ability. However, females also delay maturation in male‐biased groups, incurring a loss of reproductive lifespan without apparent benefit. Thus, in highly competitive environments, female fitness may be limited by the lack of sex‐specific plasticity. More generally, assuming that selection does act antagonistically on male and female maturation traits in the wild, our results demonstrate that genetic architecture of homologous traits can ease a major constraint on the evolution of adaptive dimorphism.",9f80231e734826e54b28b8cab4545a39bc03d811,,0
https://doi.org/10.1890/06-1585,Asymmetric competition via induced resistance: specialist herbivores indirectly suppress generalist preference and populations.,"Species may compete indirectly by altering the traits of a shared resource. For example, herbivore-induced responses in plants may make plants more resistant or susceptible to additional herbivorous insect species. Herbivore-induced plant responses can significantly affect interspecific competition and herbivore population dynamics. These herbivore-herbivore indirect interactions have been overlooked in aquatic ecosystems where previous studies used the same herbivore species to induce changes and to assess the effects of these changes. We asked whether seaweed grazing by one of two herbivorous, congeneric snail species (Littorina obtusata or Littorina littorea) with different feeding strategies and preferences would affect subsequent feeding preferences of three herbivore species (both snails and the isopod Idotea baltica) and population densities of three herbivore species (both snails and a third periwinkle snail, Lacuna vincta). In addition, we measured phlorotannin concentrations to test the hypothesis that these metabolites function as induced defenses in the Phaeophyceae. Snail herbivory induced cue-specific responses in apical tissues of the seaweed Fucus vesiculosus that affected the three herbivore species similarly. When compared to ungrazed controls, direct grazing by Littorina obtusata reduced seaweed palatability by at least 52% for both snail species and the isopod species. In contrast, direct grazing by L. littorea did not decrease seaweed palatability for any herbivore, indicating herbivore-specific responses. Previous grazing by L. obtusata reduced populations of L. littorea on outplanted seaweeds by 46% but had no effect on L. obtusata populations. Phlorotannins, a potential class of inducible chemicals in brown algae, were not more concentrated in grazed seaweed tissues, suggesting that some other trait was responsible for the induced resistance. Our results indicate that marine herbivores may compete via inducible responses in shared seaweeds. These plant-mediated interactions were asymmetric with a specialist (L. obtusata) competitively superior to a generalist (L. littorea).",a07abfa74c6660b216079320732ea7ccb0f2a68d,,0
https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.12.873315,Selection for rapid uptake of scarce or fluctuating resource explains vulnerability of glycolysis to imbalance,"Glycolysis is a conserved central pathway in energy metabolism that converts glucose to pyruvate with net production of two ATP molecules. Because ATP is produced only in the lower part of glycolysis (LG), preceded by an initial investment of ATP in the upper glycolysis (UG), achieving robust start-up of the pathway upon activation presents a challenge: a sudden increase in glucose concentration can throw a cell into a self-sustaining imbalanced state in which UG outpaces LG, glycolytic intermediates accumulate and the cell is unable to maintain high ATP concentration needed to support cellular functions. Such metabolic imbalance can result in “substrate-accelerated death”, a phenomenon observed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes when cells are exposed to an excess of substrate that previously limited growth. Here, we address why evolution has apparently not eliminated such a costly vulnerability and propose that it is a manifestation of an evolutionary trade-off, whereby the glycolysis pathway is adapted to quickly secure scarce or fluctuating resource at the expense of vulnerability in an environment with ample resource. To corroborate this idea, we perform evolutionary simulations of a simplified yeast glycolysis pathway consisting of UG, LG, phosphate transport between a vacuole and a cytosol, and a general ATP demand reaction. The pathway is evolved in constant or fluctuating resource environments by allowing mutations that affect the (maximum) reaction rate constants, reflecting changing expression levels of different glycolytic enzymes. We demonstrate that under limited constant resource, the population evolves to a genotype that is balanced but exhibits strongly imbalanced dynamics under ample resource conditions. Furthermore, when resource availability is fluctuating, the imbalanced phenotype enjoys a fitness advantage over balanced dynamics: when glucose is abundant, imbalanced pathways can quickly accumulate glycolytic intermediate FBP as intracellular storage that is used during periods of starvation to maintain high ATP concentration needed for growth. Our model further predicts that in environments with fluctuating resource, competition for glucose can result in stable coexistence of balanced and imbalanced cells, as well as repeated cycles of population crashes and recoveries that depend on such polymorphism. Overall, we demonstrate the importance of ecological and evolutionary arguments for understanding seemingly maladaptive aspects of cellular metabolism.",a0c808d9d951f18e74e58d16a63218ebfe7ba75b,,0

However, it is unclear whether social rank is associated with other traits that also predispose to addiction and whether social status similarly predicts cocaine self-administration in rats.ObjectivesThe objective of this study is to investigate whether social ranking assessed using a resource competition task affects (i) the acquisition, maintenance and reinstatement of cocaine self-administration; (ii) the dopaminergic markers in the striatum; and (iii) the expression of ancillary traits for addiction.MethodsSocial ranking was determined in group-housed rats based upon drinking times during competition for a highly palatable liquid. Rats were then evaluated for cocaine self-administration and cue-induced drug reinstatement or individual levels of impulsivity, anxiety and novelty-induced locomotor activity. Finally, dopamine content, dopamine transporter (DAT) and dopamine D2/D3 (D2/3) receptor binding were measured postmortem in the dorsal and ventral striatum.ResultsRats deemed socially dominant showed enhanced novelty reactivity but were neither more impulsive nor anxious compared with subordinate rats. Dominant rats additionally maintained higher rates of cocaine self-administration but showed no differences in the acquisition, extinction and reinstatement of this behaviour. D2/3 binding was elevated in the nucleus accumbens shell and dorsal striatum of dominant rats when compared to subordinate rats, and was accompanied by elevated DAT and reduced dopamine content in the nucleus accumbens shell.ConclusionsThese findings show that social hierarchy influences the rate of self-administered cocaine but not anxiety or impulsivity in rats. Similar to non-human primates, these effects may be mediated by striatal dopaminergic systems.",a1855ac8c01a1a1968d655a57d004f1b5acc9691,,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12254,Allometric scaling of indirect effects: body size ratios predict non-consumptive effects in multi-predator systems.,"Non-consumptive effects (NCES) frequently lead to non-independent effects of multiple predators. While such emergent predator effects are ubiquitous in natural communities, the strength of these effects varies among studies and systems, making it difficult to predict a priory how changes in predator diversity influence prey suppression. Thus, identifying general scaling rules which can explain this variation of non-independent effects is vital for modelling natural communities and how they respond to biodiversity loss. Body size is a key trait determining the nature and strength of ecological interactions. While great progress has been made using allometric relationships to predict the interaction strength of predator-prey pairs, it is unknown whether similar relationships explain variation in the strength of NCEs, and how they are related to consumptive effects. Here, we experimentally manipulate the relative size difference of multiple predators to determine whether NCEs follow general allometric scaling relationships in an aquatic multi-predator system. Results demonstrate that the presence and strength of NCEs can vary dramatically across predator combinations. However, this variation scaled predictably with the size ratio of predators, increasing the size difference among predators increased NCEs. This pattern was driven by a size-mediated shift in 'food web motif' from competition to intraguild predation and a positive correlation of NCEs and intraguild predation rate. Results indicate that models which assume that consumers have independent effects are particularly likely to make erroneous predictions when predators differ substantially in size, but simple allometric relationships of NCEs could be used to correct this bias.",a207b919d66154f7a5546db1bd6370d830cb4e21,,0

It focuses on two well documented responses of consumers to predation risk: decrease in consumer activity and habitat switch. These behavioral effects are transmitted to resources and they cause similar indirect effects as those which are mediated by density changes in consumers. Two indirect interactions are studied in this article: trophic cascades, and apparent competition. Results for density only, trait only and combined density and trait mediated interactions are compared and discussed with respect to manipulation with predator density (top-down manipulation) and resource environmental capacity (bottom-up manipulation). The article shows that trait-mediated, effects on species equilibrial densities are similar to those of density-mediated, but they are often highly non-linear. Thus, they may have potential for even stronger impact on food webs than those which are density mediated.",a242ffefff4e1430ad413b48da6fac5f849b36c5,,0

Among the many important roles that habitat plays is as a mediator of ecological interactions, including predator–prey dynamics. In the context of ecosystem restoration, there is great potential to better understand how predator–prey dynamics are influenced by habitat and whether this has implications for how ecosystems are managed. We consider the ways in which habitat serves as an important mediator of interactions between predators and their prey and present four ways in which habitat acts as an intermediary that enhances or diminishes this relationship. We found that habitat provides refuge from predators and shapes the physical traits of prey as they use their surroundings to protect themselves. We also discuss how habitat creates physical resistance and sets the cost of predation for predators and how habitat facilitates apparent competition within a community context. These roles of habitat are well established in ecology, but we believe they are underdeveloped from an applied perspective. We conclude that habitat must be appropriately considered in the context of how it mediates predation. Given the ways that habitat influences predation, restoration efforts should consider if and how physical measures may positively or negatively affect species interactions and whether this could lead to success or failure of overall programs.",a24cbe048fd85dc274ed701906e7687fdce86e28,,0

When IAS and their parasite(s) invade a guild, the effects of interspecific resource competition and/or parasite-mediated competition can alter existing native host-parasite relationships and the dependent biological traits such as native species' behaviour. We used a natural experiment of populations of native red squirrels Sciurus vulgaris that were colonized by the alien grey squirrel Sciurus carolinensis, comparing repeated measurements of red squirrel parasite infection and personality with those taken in sites where only the native species occurred. We explored two alternative hypotheses: (a) individual differences in personality traits (activity and/or sociability) of native red squirrel positively affect the probability of macroparasite spillover and thus the likelihood to acquire the alien's parasitic helminth Strongyloides robustus; (b) the combined effects of grey squirrel presence and parasite infection result in a reduction of costly personality traits (activity and/or exploration). Using data from 323 arena tests across three experimental (native species and IAS) and three control sites (only native species), we found negative correlations between native species' activity and infection with S. robustus in the sites invaded by the alien species. Activity was also negatively correlated with infection by its native helminth Trypanoxyuris sciuri but only when grey squirrels were present, while in the red-only sites there was no relationship of T. sciuri infection with any of the personality traits. Moreover, individuals that acquired S. robustus during the study reduced their activity after infection, while this was not the case for animals that remained uninfected. Our results show that parasite-mediated competition is costly, reducing activity in individuals of the native species, and altering the native host-native parasite relationships.",a2daa8581a3d839b4ab139c2ccde74f4cfefd47f,,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.70051,Local‐ and Regional‐Scale Climate Variability Drives Complex Patterns of Growth Synchrony and Asynchrony in Deep‐Sea Snappers Across the Indo‐Pacific,"Climatic variation can play a critical role in driving synchronous and asynchronous patterns in the expression of life history characteristics across vast spatiotemporal scales. The synchronisation of traits, such as an individual's growth rate, under environmental stress may indicate a loss of phenotypic diversity and thus increased population vulnerability to stochastic deleterious events. In contrast, synchronous growth under favourable ecological conditions and asynchrony during unfavourable conditions may help population resilience and buffer against the negative implications of future environmental variability. Despite the significant implications of growth synchrony and asynchrony to population productivity and persistence, little is known about its causes and consequences either within or among fish populations. This is especially true for long‐lived deep‐sea species that inhabit environments characterised by large‐scale interannual and decadal changes, which could propagate growth synchrony across vast distances. We developed otolith growth chronologies for three deep‐sea fishes (Etelis spp.) over 65° of longitude and 20° of latitude across the Indo‐Pacific region. Using reconstructed time series of interannual growth from six distinct Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), we assessed the level of spatial synchrony at the individual‐, population‐ and species‐scale. Across five decades of data, complex patterns of synchronous and asynchronous growth were apparent for adult populations within and among EEZs of the Pacific Ocean, mediated by shifts in oceanographic phenomena such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Overall, our results indicate that the degree of synchrony in biological traits at depth depends on life history stage, spatiotemporal scales of environmental variability and the influence of ecological factors such as competition and dispersal. By determining the magnitude and timing of spatially synchronous growth at depth and its links to environmental variability, we can better understand fluctuations in deep‐sea productivity and its vulnerability to future environmental stressors, which are key considerations for sustainability.",a2ea6c7720e3d6ee5e0bd33991772d755aeba80b,,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12884,Biological invasion modifies the co-occurrence patterns of insects along a stress gradient,"Summary 
1. Biological invasions have become one of the most important drivers of biodiversity loss and ecosystem change worldwide. However, it is still unclear how invasions may interact with local abiotic stressors, which are expected to increase as global change intensifies. Furthermore, we know little about the response to biological invasions of insects, despite their disproportionate contribution to global animal biodiversity. 
 
2. The aim of the present work is to investigate the impact of an invasive aquatic insect on the co-occurrence patterns of native species of insects along a salinity gradient, and determine which assembly rules are driving these patterns. 
 
3. First, we characterised the habitat specialisation and functional niches of each species from physiological and biological traits, respectively, and their degree of overlap. Second, we used field data to compare the co-occurrence patterns of native and invasive species in invaded and non-invaded areas of southern Iberia and northern Morocco. Finally, we tested if habitat filtering or niche differentiation assembly rules mediate their co-occurrence. 
 
4. In non-invaded areas habitat filtering drives habitat segregation of species along the salinity gradient, with a lower contribution of niche differentiation. The presence of the invasive insect modifies the distribution and co-occurrence patterns of native species. In invaded areas, niche differentiation seems to be the main mechanism to avoid competition among the invasive and native species, enabling coexistence and resource partitioning. 
 
5. The combined study of functional niche similarity and abiotic stressor tolerance of invasive and native species can improve our understanding of the effects of invasive species along abiotic stress gradients. This approach may increase our capacity to predict the outcomes of biological invasion in a global change context.

A few species across bee families have evolved nocturnality, displaying remarkable adaptations to overcome limitations of their daylight-suited apposition eyes. Phase inversion to nocturnality in a minority of bees that co-exist with diurnal bees provides a unique opportunity to study ecological benefits that mediate total temporal niche shifts. While floral traits and sensory modalities associated with the evolution of classical nocturnal pollination syndromes, e.g. by bats and moths, are well-studied, nocturnality in bees represents a poorly understood, recently invaded, extreme niche. To test the competitive release hypothesis, we examine how nocturnality shapes foraging by comparing pollen loads, nest pollen, and flower visitation of sympatric nocturnal and diurnal carpenter bees. We predicted that nocturnal bees primarily use night-blooming flowers, show little/no resource overlap with diurnal species and competitive release favors night-time pollen collection for provisioning. Contrarily, we found substantial resource overlap between nocturnal and diurnal bees. Flower opening times, floral longevity and plant abundance did not define nocturnal flower use. Smaller pollen loads on nocturnal foragers suggest subsistence on resource leftovers largely from diurnal flowers. Greater pollen types/diversity on nocturnal foragers indicate lower floral constancy compared to diurnal congenerics. Reduced activity during new moon compared to full moon suggests constraints to nocturnal foraging. Invasion and sustenance within the nocturnal niche is characterized by: (i) opportunistic foraging on residual resources as indicated by smaller pollen loads, extensive utilization of day-blooming flowers and substantial overlap with diurnal bees, (ii) generalization at two levels—between and within foraging trips as indicated by lower floral constancy, (iii) reduced foraging on darker nights, indicating visual constraints despite sensitive optics. This together with smaller populations and univoltine breeding in nocturnal compared to multivoltine diurnal counterparts suggest that nocturnality imposes substantial fitness costs. In conclusion, the evolution of nocturnality in bees is accompanied by resource generalization instead of specialization. Reduced floral constancy suggests differences in foraging strategies of nocturnal and diurnal bees which merits further investigation. The relative roles of competition, floral rewards and predators should be examined to fully understand the evolution and maintenance of nocturnality in bees.",a458f8ed2a5edf7a2282fa308ce372c672156d77,,0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007423,Species-Specific Traits Rather Than Resource Partitioning Mediate Diversity Effects on Resource Use,"Background The link between biodiversity and ecosystem processes has firmly been established, but the mechanisms underpinning this relationship are poorly documented. Most studies have focused on terrestrial plant systems where resource use can be difficult to quantify as species rely on a limited number of common resources. Investigating resource use at the bulk level may not always be of sufficient resolution to detect subtle differences in resource use, as species-specific nutritional niches at the biochemical level may also moderate diversity effects on resource use. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we use three co-occurring marine benthic echinoderms (Brissopsis lyrifera, Mesothuria intestinalis, Parastichopus tremulus) that feed on the same phytodetrital food source, to determine whether resource partitioning is the principal mechanism underpinning diversity effects on resource use. Specifically we investigate the use of phytodetrital pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) because many of these are essential for biological functions, including reproduction. Pigments were identified and quantified using reverse-phase high performance liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and data were analysed using a combination of extended linear regression with generalised least squares (GLS) estimation and standard multivariate techniques. Our analyses reveal no species-specific selectivity for particular algal pigments, confirming that these three species do not partition food resources at the biochemical level. Nevertheless, we demonstrate increased total resource use in diverse treatments as a result of selection effects and the dominance of one species (B. lyrifera). Conclusion Overall, we found no evidence for resource partitioning at the biochemical level, as pigment composition was similar between individuals, which is likely due to plentiful food availability. Reduced intra-specific competition in the species mixture combined with greater adsorption efficiency and differences in feeding behaviour likely explain the dominant use of resources by B. lyrifera.",a506be3fd23fa2651c954e09b65b9a0acab00c67,,0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.690200,Can Top-Down Controls Expand the Ecological Niche of Marine N2 Fixers?,"The ability of marine diazotrophs to fix dinitrogen gas (N2) is one of the most influential yet enigmatic processes in the ocean. With their activity diazotrophs support biological production by fixing about 100–200 Tg N/year and turning otherwise unavailable dinitrogen into bioavailable nitrogen (N), an essential limiting nutrient. Despite their important role, the factors that control the distribution of diazotrophs and their ability to fix N2 are not fully elucidated. We discuss insights that can be gained from the emerging picture of a wide geographical distribution of marine diazotrophs and provide a critical assessment of environmental (bottom-up) versus trophic (top-down) controls. We expand a simplified theoretical framework to understand how top-down control affects competition for resources that determine ecological niches. Selective mortality, mediated by grazing or viral-lysis, on non-fixing phytoplankton is identified as a critical process that can broaden the ability of diazotrophs to compete for resources in top-down controlled systems and explain an expanded ecological niche for diazotrophs. Our simplified analysis predicts a larger importance of top-down control on competition patterns as resource levels increase. As grazing controls the faster growing phytoplankton, coexistence of the slower growing diazotrophs can be established. However, these predictions require corroboration by experimental and field data, together with the identification of specific traits of organisms and associated trade-offs related to selective top-down control. Elucidation of these factors could greatly improve our predictive capability for patterns and rates of marine N2 fixation. The susceptibility of this key biogeochemical process to future changes may not only be determined by changes in environmental conditions but also via changes in the ecological interactions.",a596052b50bf8d418112e228dc407db4057eea06,,0

https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/380474,Trait-Mediated Indirect Effects of Phorid Flies on Ants,"This paper provides a synthesis of the ecological impact of phorid fly parasitoids on ants. We find the most important impact of phorids on ants to be trait-mediated effects. Phorids diminish the foraging activity of ants, frequently reducing the number and average size of foragers and reducing the amount of food retrieved by a colony. However, ants' coping mechanisms include changing foraging site and time. Phorids can also affect competition, especially through changes in the ability of the host to win in exploitative competition. Factors such as microclimate, resource size, and habitat complexity interact with phorids to change their effect on competition. By being highly specific and attacking ants high in the competitive hierarchy, phorids can alter the linear nature of the competitive transitivity, and by reducing the number of foragers, they can change the discovery-dominance tradeoff that is observed in some ant communities. Trait-mediated effects of phorids also cascade to other trophic levels. As an example, we discuss the trait-mediated cascade of phorids on the Azteca instabilis system in coffee. In this system, by reducing the foraging activity of A. instabilis, phorids reduce the direct and indirect biological control impact of the ant in the coffee agroecosystem.",a67bc022df2bfd4acfe3d3cb121fdec4a7e44373,,0

Eurasian perch is one of many species of fish in lakes of postglacial origin that displays a morphological and dietary variation tightly coupled to the littoral and pelagic habitats of the lake. The occurrence of such resource polymorphisms might have important consequences for local adaptation and might also be an important initial step in speciation. I have investigated the importance of a number of factors for the development of resource polymorphisms using perch as a study organism. I found a weak genetic basis for morphological differences, and the environmental influence on morphology was of such a magnitude that an induced morphology could be reversed. The results nevertheless suggested that genetic differentiation could be substantial at small spatial and temporal scales, even within habitats. Several environmental factors were shown to influence the morphological development, and the results also suggest that behavioral differences could mediate a morphological response. I also found evidence for that competition-driven divergence might only occur when divergence in resource use is favoured at the same time as growth rates are kept sufficiently high for character divergence to be effective. The results finally indicate that divergence in the gut length of individuals might co-vary with habitat and diet use in resource polymorphic populations. This might enhance habitat fidelity and possibly also facilitate the persistence of resource polymorphisms since individuals should experience a cost of switching diets due to a too specific digestive system. Based on these findings I conclude that small scaled genetic differentiation might be more common than currently acknowledged, that more multi-factorial studies are needed if we are to fully understand the mechanisms behind trait diversity, and that competition not always favors divergence.",a6b703a8b8faa9d85782c469f5d2948a21650f51,,0

In order to improve the bank’s competition, the training is very crucial. That way all bank’s employee can understand their job duties fully and overcome difficulties with an enthusiastic altitude towards work. Recent years, the banking industry has put a tremendous emphasis on the job resourcefulness of bank’s employee and expects the employees can handle their job and face the challenges in the competitive environment. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to investigate the relationships among job resourcefulness, person-job fit and job engagement as well as to understand whether person-job fit mediates the relationship between job resourcefulness and job engagement. Samples of this study were bank employees collected by convenience sampling through questionnaires. The 338 questionnaires were returned. The empirical results of this study are as follow. First, job resourcefulness is positively related to bank employees’ job engagement. Second, job resourcefulness is positively related to person-job fit. Third, person-job fit is positively related to job engagement. At last, person-job fit partially mediates the relationship between job resourcefulness and job engagement. According to the results, the research suggests that human resource managers in recruiting and selecting process should evaluate not only the test scores but also personality traits to determine whether the candidate has the quality of being job resourcefulness. Human resource practices could strengthen the employees’ training and establish the regulations of reward to improve the employees’ job vigor, and make them fully understand the content and target of their job to prove their job engagement.",aa471016a6fb479f52e3410e8ace106e7893725e,,0

https://doi.org/10.1111/JVS.12118,Trait variability differs between leaf and wood tissues across ecological scales in subtropical forests,"Question 
 
Revealing how plant traits vary over disparate spatial scales and how ecological processes mediate such variation is important for understanding plant community assembly. However, to what extent does the distribution of trait variation among ecological scales differ between leaf and wood tissues and between physical and chemical traits? What are the consequences of resource competition and/or habitat filtering on the community assembly with respect to differences between leaf and wood traits, and between physical and chemical traits? 
 
 
 
Location 
 
Subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests in five sites in the Ningbo area (29°41–50′ N, 121°36–52′ E) in eastern China. 
 
 
 
Methods 
 
Traits of 96 woody plant species were sampled and variation of ten physical- and chemical-based leaf and wood traits were partitioned across six ecological scales (site, plot, species, individual plant, twigs and leaf age) using a linear mixed model. 
 
 
 
Results 
 
From individual plant to site scales, variance partitions were distinct between leaf and wood traits. In leaf tissues, physical and chemical traits showed a consistent pattern, with the majority of variation found among species and individual plants, with little among plots. For wood tissues, the largest variation in physical traits was at the species and individual plant scales, with the largest variation in chemical traits observed at the plot scale. Variance partition was markedly similar within and across species. 
 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
Leaf and wood traits vary differently in relation to ecological scale, suggesting that trait variability is tissue-specific. The large variability of wood traits at the plot scale suggests a strong habitat filtering process. The large variation in leaf traits within plots may reflect niche differentiation across species and the importance of intra-specific variation that affects species co-existence. Our study demonstrated that physical and chemical traits may be independent. These decoupled trait axes may increase the dimensionality of niche space and facilitate species co-existence in forest communities.",aa779ff6d961da4e383f57d0be16e4ce2632c869,,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/OIK.03157,Associational resistance or susceptibility: the indirect interaction between chemically‐defended and non‐defended herbivore prey via a shared predator,"Many organisms possess chemical defences against their natural enemies, which render them unpalatable or toxic when attacked or consumed. These chemically-defended organisms commonly occur in communities with non- or less-defended prey, leading to indirect interactions between prey species, mediated by natural enemies. Although the importance of enemy-mediated indirect interactions have been well documented (e.g., apparent competition), how the presence of prey chemical defences may affect predation of non-defended prey in terrestrial communities remains unclear. Here, an experimental approach was used to study the predator-mediated indirect interaction between a chemically-defended and non-defended pest aphid species. Using laboratory-based mesocosms, aphid community composition was manipulated to include chemically-defended (CD) aphids (Brevicoryne brassicae), non-defended (ND) aphids (Myzus persicae) or a mixed assemblage of both species, on Brassica oleracea cabbage plants, in the presence or absence of a shared predator (Chrysoperla carnea larvae). Aphid population growth rates, aphid distributions on host plants and predator growth rates were measured. In single-species treatments, C. carnea reduced M. persicae population growth rate, but had no significant impact on B. brassicae population growth rate, suggesting B. brassicae chemical defences are effective against C. carnea. C. carnea had no significant impact on either aphid species population growth rate in mixed-species treatments. M. persicae (ND) therefore experienced reduced predation in the presence of B. brassicae (CD) through a predator-mediated indirect effect. Moreover, predator growth rates were significantly higher in the M. persicae-only treatments than in either the B. brassicae-only or mixed-species treatments, suggesting predation was impaired in the presence of B. brassicae (CD). A trait-mediated indirect interaction is proposed, consistent with associational resistance, in which the predator, upon incidental consumption of chemically-defended aphids is deterred from feeding, releasing non-defended aphids from predatory control.",abf65e95003853c048d12910944671c3cfddb93f,,0

https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2021.2669,A life-history trade-off gene with antagonistic pleiotropic effects on reproduction and survival in limiting environments,"Although life-history trade-offs are central to life-history evolution, their mechanistic basis is often unclear. Traditionally, trade-offs are understood in terms of competition for limited resources among traits within an organism, which could be mediated by signal transduction pathways at the level of cellular metabolism. Nevertheless, trade-offs are also thought to be produced as a consequence of the performance of one activity generating negative consequences for other traits, or the result of genes or pathways that simultaneously regulate two life-history traits in opposite directions (antagonistic pleiotropy), independent of resource allocation. Yet examples of genes with antagonistic effects on life-history traits are limited. This study provides direct evidence for a gene—RLS1, that is involved in increasing survival in nutrient-limiting environments at a cost to immediate reproduction in the single-celled photosynthetic alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Specifically, we show that RLS1 mutants are unable to properly suppress their reproduction in phosphate-deprived conditions. Although these mutants have an immediate reproductive advantage relative to the parental strain, their long-term survival is negatively affected. Our data suggest that RLS1 is a bona fide life-history trade-off gene that suppresses immediate reproduction and ensures survival by downregulating photosynthesis in limiting environments, as part of the general acclimation response to nutrient deprivation in photosynthetic organisms.",ade6e9daf05e6878c69dfb1da090899bac2b8de2,,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13686,An exotic herbivore reinforces competition between exotic and native plants,"Despite increasing evidence that herbivore‐mediated indirect effects play a major role in plant competition, it is unclear how and when they contribute to plant invasiveness. The outcomes of herbivore‐mediated indirect effects are primarily dependent on the environment and have complex interactions with the direct interactions between plants. We evaluated the herbivore‐mediated indirect effects of Solidago altissima (Asteraceae) on other co‐occurring native Asteraceae species at multiple sites in a native range [the United States (US)] and in an introduced range (Japan) using common garden experiments. We examined the effect of S. altissima on herbivore damage, above‐ground vegetative and reproductive traits of the co‐occurring Asteraceae species at sites with different densities of a herbivore, the lace bug, Corythucha marmorata, which is native to the US and introduced in Japan. We observed increased lace bug herbivory in plants grown with S. altissima in Japan but decreased lace bug herbivory in the US. We did not find consistent effect of S. altissima on aboveground vegetative production of co‐occurring plants in either ranges. Flower production decreased in plants grown with S. altissima in Japan because of both direct competition and increased herbivory. Direct competition and apparent competition via lace bug herbivory interacted to produce a strong negative effect of S. altissima on co‐occurring plants only in Japan. Synthesis. The findings imply that evolutionary history and the local environment jointly affect herbivore‐mediated indirect effects, which play a large role in shaping the pattern of herbivory and plant competition. Another implication of our results is that exotic herbivores may reinforce the negative effects of exotic plants on native plants under high herbivore density environments.",ae7619e1517c22478c8dd71bf36119a4ba904879,,0
https://doi.org/10.1089/105072501300042884,Unraveling the genetic susceptibility to autoimmune thyroid diseases: CTLA-4 takes the stage.,"167 OVER THE PAST DECADE there has been an explosion of studies on the genetics of complex diseases. Many complex diseases show familial aggregation and are believed to develop by an interaction of susceptibility genes and environmental triggers. Therefore, identifying the susceptibility genes causing complex diseases will likely lead to unraveling the primary abnormalities triggering them. Among the complex diseases the autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs) are particularly attractive for genetic studies for several reasons: (1) The phenotype of the major AITDs (Graves’ disease [GD], Hashimoto’s thyroiditis [HT]) is clearly defined, unlike in some other complex diseases (e.g., in systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]); (2) The AITDs are common (1), and commonly segregate in families (up to 50% of first-degree relatives of GD and HT patients have thyroid antibodies [TAbs] [2,3]), thus enabling collection of large numbers of families for linkage studies; (3) The AITDs comprise several interrelated conditions including GD, HT, and TAb production. These AITD phenotypes often cosegregate within the same family, thus enabling geneticists to vary these parameters in the analysis in order to study the relationships between them. For example, one can study whether the genes for GD, HT, and TAb are common or unique for each disorder, or whether TAbs are a precursor of clinical disease or represent a different disease entity (4); (4) Once a suspected gene is identified, its function in thyroid tissue can be easily studied as thyroid tissues from AITD patients are readily available. Cytotoxic T-lymhocyte–associated molecule-4 (CTLA-4) is a critical molecule in the activation of T cells by antigens. Antigen presenting cells (APCs) activate T cells by presenting to the T-cell receptor an antigenic peptide bound to an HLA class II protein on the cell surface (5). However, for the T cells to be activated by the antigen a second signal is required and these costimulatory signals can be provided by the APCs themselves or other local cells (5). The costimulatory signals are provided by a variety of proteins that are expressed on APCs (e.g., B7-1, B7-2, CD-40) and interact with receptors (CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, and CD-40L) on the surface of CD41 T lymphocytes during antigen presentation (5). CD28 and CTLA-4 are related glycoproteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily with opposing functions. Whereas the binding of B7 to CD28 on T cells augments T-cell activation, the binding of B7 to CTLA-4 is thought to downregulate Tcell activation. Indeed, activation of CTLA-4 by cross-linking inhibited T-cell responses, and blockade of CTLA-4-B7 interactions enhanced T-cell proliferation (6). Moreover, knockout mice lacking the CTLA-4 gene develop massive Tcell lymphoproliferation resulting in splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and lymphoid infiltration into many organs (7). While initially it was thought that CTLA-4 suppressed T-cell activation by competing with CD28 for binding to the B7 molecules, it is now apparent that this suppression is an active process and is not simply due to competition with CD28 for the B7 ligands. Recent data show that CTLA-4 activation during antigen presentation leads to inhibition of interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, a necessary cytokine for T-cell activation. CTLA-4 engagement also prevents T cell progression through the cell cycle thus directly inhibiting T-cell proliferation (8). The suppressive effects of CTLA-4 on T-cell activation have raised the possibility that sequence changes altering CTLA-4 function could lead to augmentation of immune responses and development of autoimmunity. Indeed, treatment of female NOD mice at the onset of insulitis with antiCTLA-4 or a monoclonal antibody specific for B7-2 (a CD28 ligand) suppressed the development of diabetes (31). Recently, there have been several reports demonstrating a weak association between the CTLA-4 gene and the AITDs (9,10–12). Earlier studies found an association between a microsatellite marker located near the CTLA-4 gene and GD, giving a relative risk of 2.1 to 2.8 (9,12). With the identification of an alanine/threonine (G/A) polymorphism inside the CTLA-4 leader peptide, this polymorphism was also tested for association with the AITDs. The ala (G) polymorphism was found to be associated with GD with a relative risk of 2.0 (11). These reports have been consistent in several populations (9,12). Two groups have also recently claimed that the G allele of the CTLA-4 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was specifically associated with Graves’ ophthal-",afc343cad4e0169e6dd4e4cb9457858ef411be6a,,0

https://doi.org/10.15224/978-1-63248-171-9-03,Wasta in the Arab World Implications on Entrepreneurship and SMEs,"— Wasta was originally a mediation mechanism in pre-colonial Arab societies which evolved into an intercessory tool to gain favourable access to positions and resources. It is both censured and abetted in present-day Middle Eastern countries like Oman where members struggle to balance Western standards of meritocracy and fair competition with the time-honoured values of solidarity, allegiance and mutual responsibility. Borne of a collectivist society where consultation and reciprocity are prized, the practice poses a challenge to the individualistic ideals of entrepreneurship which drive SMEs, often leading to the subordination of the independent entrepreneurial spirit to the imperatives of family and close relations. The remedy lies not in a drastic alteration of an institutionalized practice but in modifying wasta in such a way that entrepreneurial traits like competitiveness and efficiency are fostered, while maintaining the cultural factors that contribute to the cohesiveness of Arabian societies.",b034c4b480b4e2da008083af73428b9a81e243cf,,0

However, it is unclear whether social rank is associated with other traits that also predispose to addiction and whether social status similarly predicts cocaine self-administration in rats. The objective of this study is to investigate whether social ranking assessed using a resource competition task affects (i) the acquisition, maintenance and reinstatement of cocaine self-administration; (ii) the dopaminergic markers in the striatum; and (iii) the expression of ancillary traits for addiction. Social ranking was determined in group-housed rats based upon drinking times during competition for a highly palatable liquid. Rats were then evaluated for cocaine self-administration and cue-induced drug reinstatement or individual levels of impulsivity, anxiety and novelty-induced locomotor activity. Finally, dopamine content, dopamine transporter (DAT) and dopamine D2/D3 (D2/3) receptor binding were measured postmortem in the dorsal and ventral striatum. Rats deemed socially dominant showed enhanced novelty reactivity but were neither more impulsive nor anxious compared with subordinate rats. Dominant rats additionally maintained higher rates of cocaine self-administration but showed no differences in the acquisition, extinction and reinstatement of this behaviour. D2/3 binding was elevated in the nucleus accumbens shell and dorsal striatum of dominant rats when compared to subordinate rats, and was accompanied by elevated DAT and reduced dopamine content in the nucleus accumbens shell. These findings show that social hierarchy influences the rate of self-administered cocaine but not anxiety or impulsivity in rats. Similar to non-human primates, these effects may be mediated by striatal dopaminergic systems.",b043ec95493c273382b5ff0a32b71dd16fb66d02,,0

Although competition for resources generally increases size variability, the effect of (non-consumptive) predation on this demographic trait remains relatively poorly understood. Existing models suggest a positive correlation between growth rate (mediated by resource level) and expression of size variability (as measured by the coefficient of variation) in prey cohorts. We tested this prediction by exposing the tadpoles of the Japanese Forest Green Treefrog (Rhacophorus arboreus (Okada and Kawano, 1924) = Zhangixalus arboreus (Okada and Kawano, 1924)) to the non-lethal presence of gape-limited Japanese Fire-bellied Newts (Cynops pyrrhogaster (Boie, 1826)) at low and high predator densities in an outdoor mesocosm experiment. Tadpole growth rates and periphyton biomass increased with newt density. But in contrast to prediction, elevated growth rates did not increase but, reversely, decreased cohort size variability in the tadpoles. We discuss two potential mechanisms behind this outcome. First, increased resource availability mediated by predator feeding may have reduced the strength of competition, ultimately leading to more evenly distributed resource gains among individuals; second, if smaller individuals grew relatively faster than larger individuals, as to quicken entry to a size refuge against the gape-limited predator, then inter-individual size differences could diminish over time.",b2b634684c7e21170ec9cccfa927703ae121a2ae,,0

Freshwater lakes in high‐altitude areas represent a natural system for understanding resource polymorphism in fishes benefiting from diverse lacustrine environments and species‐poor fish assemblages. We report resource polymorphism in a cyprinid fish, Schizopygopsis thermalis, in Lake Amdo Tsonak Co, a headwater lake in the upper Salween River system. Two discrete intraspecific morphs, planktivorous and benthivorous, were identified according to geometric morphometrics and traditional univariate linear measures. The planktivorous morph exhibits a longer head, longer upper and lower jaw, larger asymptotic standard length (L∞), lower growth rate (k), and higher growth performance index (φ) than the benthivorous morph. With respect to descriptive traits, the planktivorous morph possesses a large, terminal mouth and obvious mucus pores on the cheek and chin, while the benthivorous morph is characterized by a more inferior mouth with a sharpen horny edge on the lower jaw and unconspicuous mucus pores. The discrete pelagic–benthic resources and low interspecific competition in the lake system might drive the initial differentiation of the two morphs, and partial spatial reproductive isolation in breeding further maintains and reinforces the differences between them.",b2dd95ecc9a08682515a527a8c6de0f2f1342aa2,,0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s40529-017-0183-9,Allelopathy and resource competition: the effects of Phragmites australis invasion in plant communities,"Phragmites australis, a ubiquitous wetland plant, has been considered one of the most invasive species in the world. Allelopathy appears to be one of the invasion mechanisms, however, the effects could be masked by resource competition among target plants. The difficulty of distinguishing allelopathy from resource competition among plants has hindered investigations of the role of phytotoxic allelochemicals in plant communities. This has been addressed via experiments conducted in both the greenhouse and laboratory by growing associated plants, Melaleuca ericifolia, Rumex conglomeratus, and model plant, Lactuca sativa at varying densities with the allelopathic plant, P. australis, its litter and leachate of P. australis litter. This study investigated the potential interacting influences of allelopathy and resource competition on plant growth–density relationships. In greenhouse, the root exudates mediated effects showed the strongest growth inhibition of M. ericifolia at high density whereas litter mediated results revealed increased growth at medium density treatments compared to low and high density. Again, laboratory experiments related to seed germination and seedling growth of L. sativa and R. conglomeratus exhibited phytotoxicity decreased showing positive growth as plant density increased and vice versa. Overall, the differential effects were observed among experiments but maximum individual plant biomass and some other positive effects on plant traits such as root and shoot length, chlorophyll content occurred at an intermediate density. This was attributed to the sharing of the available phytotoxin among plants at high densities which is compatible to density-dependent phytotoxicity model. The results demonstrated that plant–plant interference is the combined effect of allelopathy and resource competition with many other factors but this experimental design, target-neighbor mixed-culture in combination of plant grown at varying densities with varying level of phytotoxins, mono-culture, can successfully separate allelopathic effects from competition.",b30679bc7e305cbf8285f01ef0fc2b559ce80488,,0
https://doi.org/10.53846/goediss-4521,"Intra- and interspecific variation of functional traits, growth performance and belowground competition in Populus species","Short-rotation forestry (SRF) systems provide sustaining resource supply that is needed to meet the rapidly increasing demand in wood products and renewable energy. Poplar species (Populus spp.) are frequently used for such plantations as they maintain high yield along wide environmental ranges. Specifically aspen (Populus tremula and P. tremuloides) reach considerable productivity even on poor soils and exhibit relatively high drought tolerance when compared to other taxa of the genus. However, the use of aspen in SRF systems is not well established. The aim of this study was to investigate the intra- and interspecific variation of above- and belowground functional traits which determine differences in environmental adaptation, drought tolerance, competitive strength and hence overall species performance in different aspen demes and two further poplar species (P. tremula and P. trichocarpa). This information may contribute to optimize yield and reducing the risk of failure in plantings under current and future climates. Major differences in functional above- and belowground traits of aspen demes of particular environmental adaptation became evident in the course of this study (Chapter 2). However, variance within the aspen fine root system properties is considerably high and above- and belowground trait correspondence remains inconsistent. Fine root properties are to a lesser extent related to genetic distance among demes than leaf-related properties. The high degree of plasticity in belowground (fine root) traits compared to aboveground traits implies a heterogeneous response to high spatial and temporal variability of belowground resources what may be of relevance for species growth performance. This may also explain why the variation in fine root morphological traits was not directly linked to differences in growth among the demes. Instead, much of the within-deme variation of the investigated root morphological traits may be explained by differentiating single root sections according to the hierarchical branching structure (root orders).The intraspecific variation in wood anatomical and hydraulic properties of branches and coarse roots in five genetically distinct demes were related to variation in aboveground productivity and drought resistance (Chapter 3). Genotypic differences in the dependence of growth on branch xylem hydraulic efficiency and on hydraulic safety (cavitation vulnerability) were found. By contrast, a large variation in coarse root anatomical and hydraulic traits did not determine growth performance or drought resistance among the demes but manifest in the observation of ‘high-conductivity roots’ with extraordinarily large vessels which state the functional heterogeneity within the poplar root system. Belowground competition effects on physiologically important fine root morphological and chemical properties of P. tremula and P. trichocarpa saplings along roots of different order and age were identified (Chapter 4). First, the strong control exerted by the root order position or the age of a root segment on different root traits became evident and enabled species differentiation according to the investigated traits. The minor influence of different competition treatments on fine root morphology and chemistry suggests that morphological adaptation in response to competition is not a mandatory phenomenon. Moreover, the comparison of harvest data (fine roots of the box interior) and direct root growth observations (at a transparent front plate) revealed a mismatch between the two types of data suggesting that root polymorphism may strongly impact the interpretation of rhizoscope data. This study is the first to describe the inherent complexity and heterogeneity of the poplar root system in its anatomy, morphology and function on an intraspecific as well as interspecific scale. Further experiments and detailed root analysis within long-term field studies are needed for a better understanding of belowground root-related processes in poplar species.",b3cd711af6192ba3397ac9cdc33e2217145eb7a8,,0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.854222,Associational Effects and Indirect Interactions-The Dynamical Effects of Consumer and Resource Traits on Generalist-Resource Interactions,"Trophic interaction modifications occur in food webs when the direct or indirect interaction between two species is affected by a third species. These behavioral modification effects are often referred to as associational effects. Changes in focal resource availability and consumption by a generalist herbivore can affect a range of outcomes from resource exclusion to multiple resources coexisting with the focal plant species. Here, we investigate the indirect interaction between a focal and alternative resource mediated by a generalist consumer. Using theoretical approaches we analyse the conceptual link between associational effects (both resistance and susceptibility) and the theory of apparent competition and resource switching. We find that changes in focal resource traits have the potential to affect the long-term outcome of indirect interactions. Inclusion of density-dependence expands generalist life-histories and broadens the range where, through associational effects, the availability of alternative resources positively influence a focal resource. We conclude that different forms of associational effects could, in the long-term, lead to a range of indirect interaction dynamics, including apparent competition and apparent mutualism. Our work aims to connects the theoretical body of work on indirect interactions to the concepts of associational effects. The indirect interactions between multiple resources need more thorough investigation to appreciate the range of associational effects that could result from the dynamical interaction between a generalist consumers and its focal and alternative resources.",b458193f89da196678d11e771532c0f39ce49048,,0
https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2007.1713,CD4+T cells do not mediate within-host competition between genetically diverse malaria parasites,"Ecological interactions between microparasite populations in the same host are an important source of selection on pathogen traits such as virulence and drug resistance. In the rodent malaria model Plasmodium chabaudi in laboratory mice, parasites that are more virulent can competitively suppress less virulent parasites in mixed infections. There is evidence that some of this suppression is due to immune-mediated apparent competition, where an immune response elicited by one parasite population suppress the population density of another. This raises the question whether enhanced immunity following vaccination would intensify competitive interactions, thus strengthening selection for virulence in Plasmodium populations. Using the P. chabaudi model, we studied mixed infections of virulent and avirulent genotypes in CD4+T cell-depleted mice. Enhanced efficacy of CD4+T cell-dependent responses is the aim of several candidate malaria vaccines. We hypothesized that if immune-mediated interactions were involved in competition, removal of the CD4+T cells would alleviate competitive suppression of the avirulent parasite. Instead, we found no alleviation of competition in the acute phase, and significant enhancement of competitive suppression after parasite densities had peaked. Thus, the host immune response may actually be alleviating other forms of competition, such as that over red blood cells. Our results suggest that the CD4+-dependent immune response, and mechanisms that act to enhance it such as vaccination, may not have the undesirable affect of exacerbating within-host competition and hence the strength of this source of selection for virulence.",b4c6554fae236c260ee8ff8a0c08e0c59d39e649,,0

https://doi.org/10.3390/ani13071264,Factor in Fear: Interference Competition in Polymorphic Spadefoot Toad Tadpoles and Its Potential Role in Disruptive Selection,"Simple Summary Disruptive selection occurs when extreme phenotypes have a fitness advantage over intermediate phenotypes, thereby favoring the evolution and maintenance of diversity within populations. Resource competition within populations is an important cause of disruptive selection. Individuals can compete in two distinct ways: either by depleting resources (exploitative/indirect competition) or by impeding a competitor’s access to resources (interference/direct competition). However, it is generally assumed that exploitative competition is of greater importance for disruptive selection, while interference competition is rarely considered. Here, we experimentally explored the role of interference competition using a well-known example of disruptive selection, the Mexican spadefoot toad (Spea multiplicata), whose tadpoles develop into alternative resource-use specialists (omnivores and carnivores) while generalist, intermediate tadpoles are disfavored by disruptive selection. Our behavioral experiments revealed that intermediate tadpoles decreased their foraging in the presence of carnivores, while our competition experiment showed that interference competition with carnivores, but not omnivores, significantly lowered growth rates in intermediate tadpoles. Therefore, interference competition may be important in causing disruptive selection. Furthermore, we found that ‘fear’ (phenotypic responses to perceived predation risk) could mediate interference competition as carnivores (who are also cannibalistic) were responsible for both behavioral alterations and a decreased growth rate when direct interaction was possible. Abstract Disruptive selection arises when extreme phenotypes have a fitness advantage compared to more-intermediate phenotypes. Theory and evidence suggest that intraspecific resource competition is a key driver of disruptive selection. However, while competition can be indirect (exploitative) or direct (interference), the role of interference competition in disruptive selection has not been tested, and most models of disruptive selection assume exploitative competition. We experimentally investigated whether the type of competition affects the outcome of competitive interactions using a system where disruptive selection is common: Mexican spadefoot toads (Spea multiplicata). Spea tadpoles develop into alternative resource-use phenotypes: carnivores, which consume fairy shrimp and other tadpoles, and omnivores, which feed on algae and detritus. Tadpoles intermediate in phenotype have low fitness when competition is intense, as they are outcompeted by the specialized tadpoles. Our experiments revealed that the presence of carnivores significantly decreased foraging behavior in intermediate tadpoles, and that intermediate tadpoles had significantly lower growth rates in interference competition treatments with carnivores but not with omnivores. Interference competition may therefore be important in driving disruptive selection. As carnivore tadpoles are also cannibalistic, the ‘fear’ effect may have a greater impact on intermediate tadpoles than exploitative competition alone, similarly to non-consumptive effects in predator–prey or intraguild relationships.",b5ac8daef6d22fbbfe15215579c037fa58f7e5c7,,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.1639,Invasion of a dominant floral resource: effects on the floral community and pollination of native plants.,"Through competition for pollinators, invasive plants may suppress native flora. Community-level studies provide an integrative assessment of invasion impacts and insights into factors that influence the vulnerability of different native species. We investigated effects of the nonnative herb Lythrum salicaria on pollination of native species in 14 fens of the eastern United States. We compared visitors per flower for 122 native plant species in invaded and uninvaded fens and incorporated a landscape-scale experiment, removing L. salicaria flowers from three of the invaded fens. Total flower densities were more than three times higher in invaded than uninvaded or removal sites when L. salicaria was blooming. Despite an increase in number of visitors with number of flowers per area, visitors per native flower declined with increasing numbers of flowers. Therefore, L. salicaria invasion depressed visitation to native flowers. In removal sites, visitation to native flowers was similar to uninvaded sites, confirming the observational results and also suggesting that invasion had not generated a persistent build-up of visitor populations. To study species-level impacts, we examined effects of invasion on visitors per flower for the 36 plant species flowering in both invaded and uninvaded fens. On average, the effect of invasion represented about a 20% reduction in visits per flower. We measured the influence of plant traits on vulnerability to L. salicaria invasion using meta-analysis. Bilaterally symmetrical flowers experienced stronger impacts on visitation, and similarity in flower color to L. salicaria weakly intensified competition with the invader for visitors. Finally, we assessed the reproductive consequences of competition with the invader in a dominant flowering shrub, Dasiphora fruticosa. Despite the negative effect of invasion on pollinator visitation in this species, pollen limitation of seed production was not stronger in invaded than in uninvaded sites, suggesting little impact of competition for pollinators on its population demography. Negative effects on pollination of native plants by this copiously flowering invader appeared to be mediated by increases in total flower density that were not matched by increases in pollinator density. The strength of impact was modulated across native species by their floral traits and reproductive ecology.",b606f7071dc481f60e29a67d8454c3e70e98da0a,,0

We examine the direct and indirect effects of parasitism and discuss examples of density and parasite-induced trait-mediated effects. Recent work reveals previously unrecognized complexity in parasite-mediated interactions. In addition to parasite-modified and apparent competition leading to species exclusion or enabling coexistence, parasites and predators interact in different ways to regulate or destablize the population dynamics of their joint prey. An emerging area is the impact of parasites on intraguild predation (IGP). Parasites can increase vulnerability of infected individuals to cannibalism or predation resulting in reversed species dominance in IGP hierarchies. We discuss the potential significance of parasites for community structure and biodiversity, in particular their role in promoting species exclusion or coexistence and the impact of emerging diseases. Ongoing invasions provide examples where parasites mediate native/invader interactions and play a key role in determining the outcome of invasions. We highlight the need for more quantitative data to assess the impact of parasites on communities, and the combination of theoretical and empirical studies to examine how the effects of parasitism scale up to community-level processes.",b6567a8bd834f048a4281a0797ba5b5e66bc8a49,,0

A Case Study with Tropical Lianas and Trees,"Organisms are adapted to their environment through a suite of anatomical, morphological, and physiological traits. These functional traits are commonly thought to determine an organism’s tolerance to environmental conditions. However, the differences in functional traits among co-occurring species, and whether trait differences mediate competition and coexistence is still poorly understood. Here we review studies comparing functional traits in two co-occurring tropical woody plant guilds, lianas and trees, to understand whether competing plant guilds differ in functional traits and how these differences may help to explain tropical woody plant coexistence. We examined 36 separate studies that compared a total of 140 different functional traits of co-occurring lianas and trees. We conducted a meta-analysis for ten of these functional traits, those that were present in at least five studies. We found that the mean trait value between lianas and trees differed significantly in four of the ten functional traits. Lianas differed from trees mainly in functional traits related to a faster resource acquisition life history strategy. However, the lack of difference in the remaining six functional traits indicates that lianas are not restricted to the fast end of the plant life–history continuum. Differences in functional traits between lianas and trees suggest these plant guilds may coexist in tropical forests by specializing in different life–history strategies, but there is still a significant overlap in the life–history strategies between these two competing guilds.",b6fdcc1c9f9e48eef4878264e360899e3b5465cb,,0

These behaviors are manifest as decisions on when to stay and exploit a current resource patch or move to a particular neighboring patch, based on information of the resource qualities of the patches and the anticipated level of intraspecific competition within patches. We use a genetic algorithm approach and an individual’s biomass as a fitness surrogate to explore the foraging strategy diversity of evolving guilds under clonal versus hermaphroditic sexual reproduction. We first present the resource exploitation processes, movement on cellular arrays, and genetic algorithm components of the model. We then discuss their implementation on the Nova software platform. This platform seamlessly combines the dynamical systems modeling of consumer-resource interactions with agent-based modeling of individuals moving over a landscapes, using an architecture that lays transparent the following four hierarchical simulation levels: 1.) within-patch consumer-resource dynamics, 2.) within-generation movement and competition mitigation processes, 3.) across-generation evolutionary processes, and 4.) multiple runs to generate the statistics needed for comparative analyses. The focus of our analysis is on the question of how the biomass production efficiency and the diversity of guilds of foraging strategy types, exploiting resources over a patchy landscape, evolve under clonal versus random hermaphroditic sexual reproduction. Our results indicate greater biomass production efficiency under clonal reproduction only at higher population densities, and demonstrate that polymorphisms evolve and are maintained under random mating systems. The latter result questions the notion that some type of associative mating structure is needed to maintain genetic polymorphisms among individuals exploiting a common patchy resource on an otherwise spatially homogeneous landscape.",b70f6e7b8c67b34bcef3ee6d25e9bac1a3057312,,0
https://doi.org/10.2307/1937373,Interspecific Competition between Root-Feeding and Leaf-Galling Aphids Mediated by Host-Plant Resistance,"While the competitive interactions of herbivores are often debated, rarely have the resistance traits of their host plants been considered as an important factor that might determine the outcome of an interaction. In the study reported here, host-mediated interactions were explored for two aphid species that feed on plants of the genus Cheno- podium. Pemphigus betae feeds underground on roots, while Hayhurstia atriplicis feeds aboveground where it forms leaf galls. Although they never encountered one another directly, these two aphid species shared a common resource, the phloem sap of their host. We examined the effects of each of these herbivore species on their host plants and on one another through several garden and growth chamber experiments. Four major results emerged. First, the root-feeding aphid P. betae had no significant effects on its hosts. In contrast, leaf galling by H. atriplicis reduced overall host mass by an average of 54% and seed set by an average of 60%. Second, competitive interactions between the herbivore species depended on the level of host resistance to leaf galling by H. atriplicis. On susceptible plants, leaf-galling colonies of H. atriplicis reduced P. betae numbers by an average of 9 1%, often eliminating the root feeders entirely. In contrast, on plants resistant to galling, H. atriplic is were smaller and did not affect P. betae infesting roots of the same hosts. Third, the interaction was asymmetrical; although H. atriplicis had a strong negative effect on P. betae, the latter showed no measurable effects on H. atriplicis. Censuses indicated that the strong negative effects of H. atriplicis on P. betae, as found in the growth chamber and garden experiments, also take place naturally in the field. Fourth, although one might expect plants resistant to one aphid species to be resistant to other aphids also, resistance to leaf-galling aphids is not correlated with resistance to root-feeding aphids in this system.",b77cf52fc81dc4f32ce9f56e05953ce7244aecdb,,0

We used common lizards (Zootoca vivipara) in a replicated experimental setting: one focal individual received information from two other individuals coming from peripheral environments, before being given the opportunity to relocate in one or another of the peripheral environments. Our analyses revealed that the behavior of informants, their mother’s morphology, as well as the quality of informants’ environment, affected movement decisions: the probability to relocate from the focal area increased when informants displayed traits associated with low resources (no food intake, poor maternal condition) or high competition (high activity). The physical condition of individuals also mediated the use of social information about food intake, with a match between resource availability in informants and personal condition. Conversely, spatial orientation was not affected by the contrast of phenotype between informants nor by spatial variability in resource availability. This study highlights that multiple social information sources can be used for movement decisions, likely because these information sources reflect the quality of the surrounding environment (e.g., competition level or resources availability). It also emphasizes that social information use for movement is conditioned by individual phenotype.",b94969e93c1924c949c4b79e905bce5582d1fc0b,,0
https://doi.org/10.1086/695832,Evolution as a Coexistence Mechanism: Does Genetic Architecture Matter?*,"Species sharing a prey or a predator species may go extinct due to exploitative or apparent competition. We examine whether evolution of the shared species acts as a coexistence mechanism and to what extent the answer depends on the genetic architecture underlying trait evolution. In our models of exploitative and apparent competition, the shared species evolves its defense or prey use. Evolving species are either haploid or diploid. A single locus pleiotropically determines prey nutritional quality and predator attack rates. When pleiotropy is sufficiently antagonistic (e.g., nutritional prey are harder to capture), eco-evolutionary assembly culminates in one of two stable states supporting only two species. When pleiotropy is weakly antagonistic or synergistic, assembly is intransitive: species-genotype pairs are cyclically displaced by rare invasions of the missing genotypes or species. This intransitivity allows for coexistence if, along its equilibria, the geometric mean of recovery rates exceeds the geometric mean of loss rates of the rare genotypes or species. By affecting these rates, synergistic pleiotropy can mediate coexistence, while antagonistic pleiotropy does not. For diploid populations experiencing weak antagonistic pleiotropy, superadditive allelic contributions to fitness can mitigate coexistence via an eco-evolutionary storage effect. Density dependence and mutations also promote coexistence. These results highlight how the efficacy of evolution as a coexistence mechanism may depend on the underlying genetic architecture.",b9ef356e5fe5842de69d18e06939c4cb89d90d47,,0

 European honey bees have been introduced across the globe and may compete with native bees for floral resources. Compounding effects of urbanization and introduced species on native bees are, however, unclear. Here, we investigated how honey bee abundance and foraging patterns related to those of native bee abundance and diversity in residential gardens and native vegetation remnants for 2 years in urbanized areas of the Southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot and assessed how niche overlap influenced these relationships. Honey bees did not overtly suppress native bee abundance; however, complex relationships emerged when analysing these relationships according to body size, time of day and floral resource levels. Native bee richness was positively correlated with overall honeybee abundance in the first year, but negatively correlated in the second year, and varied with body size. Native bees that had higher resource overlap with honey bees were negatively associated with honey bee abundance, and resource overlap between honey bees and native bees was higher in residential gardens. Relationships with honey bees varied between native bee taxa, reflecting adaptations to different flora, plus specialization. Thus, competition with introduced bees varies by species and location, mediated by dietary breadth and overlap and by other life-history traits of individual bee species.",b9fbe6b9bb823369f41fd85fcbbd833bc3d28513,,0

Here, we study the relative importance of grazers, water physics and chemistry on the daily net accumulation rates (AR) of individual phytoplankton from natural communities, grouped into six size classes from circa 10 to 500 μm. Using a Random Forest modelling approach and four years of daily data from a lake, we find that water temperature is generally a pivotal control of all phytoplankton AR. At the same time, nutrients and light are important for the smallest and the largest classes. Mesozooplankton abundance is a key predictor of the AR for small phytoplankton, with microzooplankton being important for the middle-size range. In our data, large and small phytoplankton have different (seasonal) blooming patterns: small forms are favoured by low temperature and grazing, and high phosphorus levels. Larger forms show positive ARs at high temperatures and low phosphorus (being relatively insensitive to zooplankton grazing). These results help us understand the opportunities and limitations of using size to explain and model phytoplankton responses to biotic and abiotic environmental change.",bae526269ee8e22aa32613680071625ede43f651,,0

https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.4145,Not attackable or not crackable—How pre‐ and post‐attack defenses with different competition costs affect prey coexistence and population dynamics,"Abstract It is well‐known that prey species often face trade‐offs between defense against predation and competitiveness, enabling predator‐mediated coexistence. However, we lack an understanding of how the large variety of different defense traits with different competition costs affects coexistence and population dynamics. Our study focusses on two general defense mechanisms, that is, pre‐attack (e.g., camouflage) and post‐attack defenses (e.g., weaponry) that act at different phases of the predator—prey interaction. We consider a food web model with one predator, two prey types and one resource. One prey type is undefended, while the other one is pre‐ or post‐attack defended paying costs either by a higher half‐saturation constant for resource uptake or a lower maximum growth rate. We show that post‐attack defenses promote prey coexistence and stabilize the population dynamics more strongly than pre‐attack defenses by interfering with the predator's functional response: Because the predator spends time handling “noncrackable” prey, the undefended prey is indirectly facilitated. A high half‐saturation constant as defense costs promotes coexistence more and stabilizes the dynamics less than a low maximum growth rate. The former imposes high costs at low resource concentrations but allows for temporally high growth rates at predator‐induced resource peaks preventing the extinction of the defended prey. We evaluate the effects of the different defense mechanisms and costs on coexistence under different enrichment levels in order to vary the importance of bottom‐up and top‐down control of the prey community.",bea47f077d74ff393efb0f398b5af02f31ca75e8,,0

In the present study, we compared thermal tolerance, walking speed (WS) and pupal development (PD) for 28 drosophilid species from cool-temperate, warm-temperate, and subtropical regions by the phylogenetically-based method and the conventional regression to understand trade-offs between these traits. A significant negative relationship was observed between cold tolerance and the rate of PD in both sexes and between cold tolerance and WS in the male in the phylogenetically-based analysis. Similar results were obtained in the conventional regression analysis, although the level of significance somewhat differed. Thus, cold tolerant species are assumed to have lost abilities to develop and walk fast. Subsequently, they may become more vulnerable to predators, parasitoids or infectious microorganisms and may have become extinct in warmer regions through enemy-mediated interactions and/or resource competition with cold susceptible species with faster development and quicker locomotion. In the present study, no significant relationship was observed between heat tolerance and WS or the rate of PD in the phylogenetically-based analysis, although heat tolerance was significantly related with the rate of PD in the conventional regression analysis. Thus, trade-offs associated with heat tolerance were not apparent. © 2007 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2007, 90, 375–380.",bedfac60cf0fd9a4d9a085aac785dae7a8fbe649,,0

https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9599,Can diet niche partitioning enhance sexual dimorphism?,"Abstract Classic evolutionary theory suggests that sexual dimorphism evolves primarily via sexual and fecundity selection. However, theory and evidence are beginning to accumulate suggesting that resource competition can drive the evolution of sexual dimorphism, via ecological character displacement between sexes. A key prediction of this hypothesis is that the extent of ecological divergence between sexes will be associated with the extent of sexual dimorphism. As the stable isotope ratios of animal tissues provide a quantitative measure of various aspects of ecology, we carried out a meta‐analysis examining associations between the extent of isotopic divergence between sexes and the extent of body size dimorphism. Our models demonstrate that large amounts of between‐study variation in isotopic (ecological) divergence between sexes is nonrandom and may be associated with the traits of study subjects. We, therefore, completed meta‐regressions to examine whether the extent of isotopic divergence between sexes is associated with the extent of sexual size dimorphism. We found modest but significantly positive associations across species between size dimorphism and ecological differences between sexes, that increased in strength when the ecological opportunity for dietary divergence between sexes was greatest. Our results, therefore, provide further evidence that ecologically mediated selection, not directly related to reproduction, can contribute to the evolution of sexual dimorphism.",bfcedba3b5206806d8309c4b206d4cfa408a0c0c,,0

https://doi.org/10.1086/727483,"Resource Variation Within and Between Patches: Where Exploitation Competition, Local Adaptation, and Kin Selection Meet","In patch- or habitat-structured populations, different processes can favor adaptive polymorphism at different scales. While spatial heterogeneity can generate spatially disruptive selection favoring variation between patches, local competition can lead to locally disruptive selection promoting variation within patches. So far, almost all theory has studied these two processes in isolation. Here, we use mathematical modeling to investigate how resource variation within and between habitats influences the evolution of variation in a consumer population where individuals compete in finite patches connected by dispersal. We find that locally and spatially disruptive selection typically act in concert, favoring polymorphism under a wider range of conditions than when in isolation. But when patches are small and dispersal between them is low, kin competition inhibits the emergence of polymorphism, especially when the latter is driven by local competition for resources. We further use our model to clarify what comparisons between trait and neutral genetic differentiation (QST/FST comparisons) can tell about the nature of selection. Overall, our results help us understand the interaction between two major drivers of polymorphism: locally and spatially disruptive selection, and how this interaction is modulated by the unavoidable effects of kin selection under limited dispersal.",c0e299333e5f144b40ebff1358c9a52b2ec08b4a,,0

It is well-established that apparent competition can result from changes in predator abundance or behavior caused by interactions with alternate prey, but no previous empirical study has demonstrated that apparent competition can also result from prey-induced changes in predator morphology. This trait-mediated alternative mechanism of apparent competition would expand the range of conditions under which apparent competition might occur in nature and identify new ways to generate or modify apparent competition in applied contexts. Here, as a proof of concept, we show that trait-mediated apparent competition can arise from inducible offenses and show how it operates using experiments involving three ciliates. When it feeds on Colpidium kleini, the intraguild predator Tetrahymena vorax increases in size to the extent that it can then consume Paramecium aurelia, an even larger prey. When feeding only on bacteria, however, Tetrahymena remains smaller and is unable to consume Paramecium. This trait-mediated indirect effect leads to the predatory exclusion of Paramecium, while Tetrahymena and Colpidium coexist. Developmental expansions such as those underlying the interactions observed in our study are not limited to ciliates, such as Tetrahymena, but occur among many diverse taxa and may have a surprising degree of influence over the structure and dynamics of food webs.",c2d65bcf5057943182e09ad7184b88067d17d72e,,0

We analyzed inter-specific competitive interactions between a large consumer and smaller competitors, whose energetics, selection and giving-up behaviour on identical resource patches scaled with individual body size. The aim was to investigate whether pure metabolic constraints on patch behaviour of vagile species can determine coexistence conditions consistent with existing theoretical and experimental evidence. We used an individual-based spatially explicit simulation model at a spatial scale defined by the home range of the large consumer, which was assumed to be parthenogenic and semelparous. Under exploitative conditions, competitive coexistence occurred in a range of body size ratios between 2 and 10. Asymmetrical competition and the mechanism underlying asymmetry, determined by the scaling of energetics and patch behaviour with consumer body size, were the proximate determinant of inter-specific coexistence. The small consumer exploited patches more efficiently, but searched for profitable patches less effectively than the larger competitor. Therefore, body-size related constraints induced niche partitioning, allowing competitive coexistence within a set of conditions where the large consumer maintained control over the small consumer and resource dynamics. The model summarises and extends the existing evidence of species coexistence on a limiting resource, and provides a mechanistic explanation for decoding the size-abundance distribution patterns commonly observed at guild and community levels.",c34ef1dcb65d21b0ce2cf65ba1be5cfe0971a893,,0

https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.1969,Predicting coexistence in species with continuous ontogenetic niche shifts and competitive asymmetry.,"A longstanding problem in ecology is whether structured life cycles impede or facilitate coexistence between species. Theory based on populations with only two discrete stages in the life-cycle indicates that for two species to coexist, at least one must shift its niche between stages and each species must be a better competitor in one of the niches. However, in many cases, niche shifts are associated with changes in an underlying continuous trait like body size and we have few predictions concerning conditions for coexistence for such a widespread form of ontogenetic development. We develop a framework for analyzing species coexistence based on Integral Projection Models (IPMs) that incorporates continuous ontogenetic changes in both the resource niche and competitive ability. We parameterize the model using experimental data from Trinidadian guppies and show how niche shifts and competitive symmetries impact species coexistence. Overall, our results show that the effects of competition on fitness depend upon trait-mediated niche-separation, trait-mediated competitive asymmetry in the part of the niche that is shared across body sizes, and the sensitivity of fitness to body size. Interactions among these processes generate multiple routes to coexistence. We discuss how our modeling framework expands results from two-stage models to mutli-stage or continuous stage models and allows for deriving predictions that can be tested in populations displaying continuous changes in niche use and competitive ability.",c40cb0facc101b49bcd7aee5474f820678f46900,,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.14018,Effects of biotic interactions on plant fecundity depend on spatial and functional structure of communities and time since disturbance,"Biotic interactions in plant communities affect individual fitness and community dynamics. Interactions between plants vary in space, over time and with organisational complexity. Yet it is challenging to quantify temporal, spatial and functional determinants of different types of interactions between long‐lived perennial plant species and their effect on lifetime fecundity. We studied how plant–plant, pollinator‐ and seed predator‐mediated interactions affect year‐to‐year variation in three fecundity components (cone production, seed set and seed survival) during post‐fire recovery. Age‐stratified data on the three fecundity components were collected in 19 even‐aged communities comprising 20 serotinous Protea shrub species in the South African Fynbos. We analyse data on these fecundity components with neighbourhood models to infer the sign and strength of interactions throughout post‐disturbance recovery, the neighbour plant traits that shape them and the spatial scale at which interactions take place. For each fecundity component, these models describe how neighbourhood effects change over time and with spatial distance between plants. We then predicted neighbourhood effects on individual fecundity components and cumulative reproductive output at different post‐fire stand ages for each focal plant. Competitive effects on cone production and seed set increased with post‐fire stand age as biomass and floral resources for pollinators build up. In contrast, neighbourhood effects on seed survival were weak throughout post‐disturbance recovery. Plant–plant interactions were shaped by neighbour traits related to resource acquisition, whereas animal‐mediated interactions depended on neighbour traits related to resource availability for pollinators and seed predators. The spatial scale of the interactions increased from plant–plant over predator‐mediated to pollinator‐mediated interactions. The joint effect of these interactions on cumulative reproductive output caused the proportion of focal plants experiencing competition to increase with time since fire. Synthesis. We show that temporal changes in biotic interactions throughout post‐disturbance recovery of perennial plant communities depend on functional traits and can be integrated into neighbourhood effects on lifetime fecundity. Studying the temporal, spatial and functional determinants of neighbourhood effects on lifetime fecundity is important for predicting not only individual plant fitness but also population and community dynamics in changing environments.",c49bf90644418fb49572a8c04da4fb4637c3150f,,0

https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aat2456,Bacterial antagonism in host-associated microbial communities,"Interspecies competition shapes communities The gut microbiota of mammals is diverse and dynamic, and gut bacteria respond sensitively to diet and drug intake. Nevertheless, in a healthy adult, microbial community composition remains remarkably stable over time, despite being highly individual. García-Bayona and Comstock review the mechanisms that gut bacterial species use to jostle for space and resources and maintain their populations in the face of intense and varied competition. Bacteria have evolved a range of antibiotics, bacteriocins, toxins, and delivery devices to enable interspecies conflict. These interbacterial weapons possess a spectrum of specificities and range from those that target strains of their own species to broad-acting bacteriocides. This toxic armamentarium provides a valuable resource for potential therapeutic development. Science, this issue p. eaat2456 BACKGROUND Microbial communities are ubiquitous on Earth. The microbiota of different habitats are diverse and have distinct functional traits, but there are common ecological principles that govern their composition. The ability of a microbe to compete with other members of its community for resources is paramount to its success. Competition through the production of molecules that harm other members, known as interference competition, is also important in the assembly and maintenance of microbial communities. As new technologies allow for more in-depth analyses of microbial communities and their genetic content, we are better able to identify new antimicrobial toxins and analyze the effects of their production. Here, we explore the range of antibacterial protein/peptide toxins and toxin-secretion systems, together with the fitness benefits they confer to the producing organisms. Because human-associated microbial communities have been intensely studied over the past decade, our focus is on the growing body of data regarding bacterial antagonism in these and other host-associated microbial communities. ADVANCES Studies continue to reveal the large arsenal of antibacterial peptides and proteins that bacteria produce and the secretion systems that they use to deliver these toxins to competing cells. Bacterially produced antimicrobial peptides and proteins are diverse in terms of their structures, cellular targets, mechanisms of action, and spatial range. Their antagonistic range also varies; some are limited to intraspecies killing, whereas others are able to kill across genera, families, and orders. Through a combination of mathematical modeling and experimental model systems, the ecological outcomes of bacterial antagonism are being elucidated. In vivo analyses in host models have shown that some antimicrobial toxins play a role in microbiota-mediated colonization resistance by preventing invasion of pathogens. Some pathogens, however, also use toxins to battle with the resident microbiota to invade an ecosystem and cause disease. Antagonism has also been shown to facilitate genome evolution; the DNA released from killed cells can be taken up and incorporated into the aggressor’s genome. In some cases, antagonism has been shown to increase rather than reduce microbial diversity, potentially through promotion of spatial segregation of competing strains, facilitating the exchange of signals and secreted products between related cells (kin). The factors that regulate the production and release of some antibacterial toxins are also becoming better understood. Studies are revealing that toxin producers respond to various environmental signals, including signals that indicate host occupancy, that nutrients are limiting, or that they may be attacked by other bacterial community members. OUTLOOK Although bacterial antagonism is an active area of research, we are still in the early stages of understanding the impacts of these interactions in natural community settings and how they influence the overall structure, dynamics, and composition of complex microbial communities. The rapid increase in the number of available metagenomic datasets derived from diverse microbial communities and the expanding capability to culture and genetically modify these organisms is allowing for the identification and characterization of new . The protective function of microbiota-produced toxins in warding off pathogens indicates a potential for applications in medical, agricultural, and other industrial settings. In addition, the inclusion of antibacterial toxins in genetically engineered bacteria (live biotherapeutics) may allow for specific targeting of harmful community members, including those involved in therapeutic failures, and may also allow a live biotherapeutic to compete with members of the microbiota to deliver various health-promoting functions. Intra- and interspecies antagonism—the example of Bacteroides species in the human gut. Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides uniformis use MACPF (membrane attack complex/perforin) toxins—BSAP-1 and BSAP-2, respectively—for intraspecies killing. Producer strains carry a modified receptor [outer membrane protein (OMP) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) glycan] that confers resistance to its cognate toxin. B. fragilis can also kill other B. fragilis strains and most gut Bacteroidales species via type VI secretion systems (T6SSs). Antagonistic interactions are abundant in microbial communities and contribute not only to the composition and relative proportions of their members but also to the longer-term stability of a community. This Review will largely focus on bacterial antagonism mediated by ribosomally synthesized peptides and proteins produced by members of host-associated microbial communities. We discuss recent findings on their diversity, functions, and ecological impacts. These systems play key roles in ecosystem defense, pathogen invasion, spatial segregation, and diversity but also confer indirect gains to the aggressor from products released by killed cells. Investigations into antagonistic bacterial interactions are important for our understanding of how the microbiota establish within hosts, influence health and disease, and offer insights into potential translational applications.",c64661161b43f837cfa9d61c10c9e8cbfcd5495a,,0

Despite the ubiquity of phenotypic variation within natural populations, its effects on the dynamics of ecological communities are not well understood. Here, we use a quantitative genetics framework to examine how phenotypic variation in a predator affects the outcome of apparent competition between its two prey species. Classical apparent competition theory predicts that prey have reciprocally negative effects on each other. The addition of phenotypic trait variation in predation can marginalize these negative effects, mediate coexistence, or generate positive indirect effects between the prey species. Long-term coexistence or facilitation, however, can be preceded by long transients of extinction risk whenever the heritability of phenotypic variation is low. Greater heritability can circumvent these ecological transients but also can generate oscillatory and chaotic dynamics. These dramatic changes in ecological outcomes, in the sign of indirect effects, and in stability suggest that studies which ignore intraspecific trait variation may reach fundamentally incorrect conclusions regarding ecological dynamics.",c97369ad632340b7be5762d93d6cb836d2055670,,0
https://doi.org/10.26686/wgtn.17008093.v1,"Factors influencing the recruitment, growth and reproduction of a temperate reef fish, Forsterygion lapillum","In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of population dynamics, it is vital to identify the key factors that contribute to variation in both survival and reproductive success throughout the life history of an organism. The population dynamics of reef fishes may be influenced by events occurring across multiple life stages, throughout the entire life cycle. For instance, the input of new individuals into a population (recruitment) is heavily shaped by mortality in the larval and juvenile stages, which is influenced by conspecific interactions and habitat characteristics. For individuals that survive, variation in somatic growth histories during development may influence mating success among fish that successfully recruit into the adult population, and particular developmental histories may receive a disproportionate amount of a population’s reproductive output. However, female preferences for particular phenotypes may also be modified by events occurring in adult life, such as parasite infection. Finally, absolute reproductive success (i.e., the number of offspring that survive to reproductive age) may be dependent upon early larval mortality of offspring, and variation in larval mortality among spawning sites could have consequences for metapopulation dynamics. In this thesis, I investigated how recruitment, growth and reproductive success varied among individuals of a small temperate reef fish, Forsterygion lapillum, the common triplefin, based upon their developmental histories, morphological traits, and habitat characteristics (including conspecific densities, regional locations, etc.). Specifically, I examined:  - how the spatial distribution and survival of juveniles is influenced by age-class interactions (Chapter 2) - verified methods to measure somatic growth rates during development using scale structures (Chapter 3) - explored how previous growth rates influence reproductive success (Chapter 4) - evaluated how reproductive success is modified by the presence of ectoparasites (Chapter 5) - and finally, assessed how natal origin modifies larval survival probabilities among offspring (Chapter 6).  The larvae of many reef fishes settle into habitats that are already occupied by adults, and interactions between age classes (intercohort interactions) may affect spatial variation in recruitment strength across settlement sites. In Chapter 2, I evaluated spatial covariation in juvenile and adult densities of F. lapillum (within the preferred settlement habitats of juveniles) to investigate correlations between adult and juvenile densities potentially caused by age-class interactions. The relationship between juvenile and adult densities followed a dome-shaped curve, with a negative correlation between juveniles and adults at higher adult densities. The shape of this curve was temporally variable, but was otherwise unaffected by particular features of the site (algal species identity). Using a laboratory-based experiment that used a “multiple predator effects” (MPE) design, I tested the hypothesis that increased settler mortality, caused by either (i) intercohort competition leading to enhanced predation risk or (ii) cannibalism by adults on juveniles, contributed to the observed negative relationship between juvenile and adult densities. Results suggested overall mortality attributable to cannibalism was low; however, smaller settlers appeared to be more vulnerable to cannibalism. There was no evidence that combined or interacting effects between predators (F. lapillum adults and Forsterygion varium [the variable triplefin]) increased predation risk in settlers of F. lapillum. Overall, these results highlight the potentially complex effects adult residents may have on shaping patterns of recruitment and the distributions of new juveniles.  Somatic growth rates through ontogeny are one of the most important metrics for understanding fish populations and in Chapter 3, I evaluate the use of spacing between growth increments on fish scales (called circuli) as a measurement technique for assessing historical growth in F. lapillum. First, I established the relationship between scale growth and body size, and determined how variable this relationship was among populations. The body-scale size relationship was strongly positive and was unaffected by gender; however, there did appear to be significant differences between certain populations. Second, I monitored somatic and fish scale growth in the laboratory to measure the relationship between somatic growth and spacing between growth increments (intercirculus spacing). New scale growth and circuli deposition were both positively correlated with somatic growth. Average intercirculus spacing was also positively correlated with somatic growth rate, but this appeared to differ between age/size classes, with the older and larger individuals showing a weaker relationship. Results suggest that intercirculus spacing can be used to determine previous growth histories, but may be limited to particular size/age ranges (e.g., juveniles).  In Chapter 4, I employ the techniques developed in Chapter 3 to examine how early growth rates (derived from fish scales) and male morphological traits explain variation in reproductive output between individual males in F. lapillum. I measured the reproductive success of breeding males in relation to their size and growth rates over the breeding season at two different spawning locations. Clutch size (number of eggs per nest) was highly variable among individuals over the study period; however, I detected a significant, albeit subtle, negative correlation between clutch size and growth rates after settlement. Although growth explained relatively small amounts of total variation, it was the only male trait I measured that significantly correlated with clutch size. The negative effects of faster growth on clutch size were greatest during the period of growth after settlement suggesting that growth at this early stage may be important for later reproductive success (early post-settlement).  In Chapter 5, I examined how infection with an ectoparasite modified reproductive success among individual males using a field survey. Females often preferentially mate with unparasitised males, and therefore parasitised males experience lowered reproductive success. In this study, individuals of greater total length were more likely to be infected with an ectoparasite, but were also more likely to have an egg nest. Parasite infection had no effect on reproductive success (either the presence of a nest, or the average surface area of eggs if a nest was present). Positive covariation in total length, reproductive success, and parasite infection potentially suggest that the influence of parasitic infection on reproductive success may depend upon the strength of selection for larger male body size. In addition, this study provides the first quantitative measurement of ectoparasite infection for both the focal parasite species (Caligus buechlerae) and the host (F. lapillum).  Finally, in Chapter 6, I explore how larval survival is mediated by spawning location. In marine reef fish, spatially isolated adult populations may be connected (i.e., have gene flow) via larval dispersal; however, differential larval survival between source populations may mediate both the degree of population connectivity as well as the reproductive success of individuals within those source populations. To evaluate variation in larval quality among different spawning locations, I conducted a laboratory assay to measure the potential effects of source population on larval time to starvation, as starvation is often proposed as a major source of mortality for larval fish. Average survival time was 3.75 days, but survival analysis indicated that starvation resistance did not differ between the two natal sources. For individual nests, mean larval size was negatively correlated with their mean survival time, although this was only apparent in larvae collected from one population (the south coast). My findings indicate that variation in larval traits between source populations does exist, but that on average, source populations had equal resistance to starvation. Given the differences between source populations in (i) the relationship between larval mortality and larval size (i.e., the absence of size effects in one source population) and (ii) overall variation in larval size (larger larvae on the south coast), the relative contribution of larvae from each source population may vary under certain conditions (e.g., low levels of food availability).  In conclusion, the field surveys and laboratory experiments conducted in this thesis demonstrate the potential for a variety of factors across multiple life history stages to influence recruitment, growth and reproduction. These findings suggest that factors across multiple life stages (e.g., conspecific density, previous growth histories, or spawning site) have the ability to influence individual success, and in turn populations. By carefully considering and integrating these factors into our studies of population dynamics, we may be able to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the spatio-temporal fluctuations in populations for marine reef fish.",ca4bbe66f82ace7a40e9463ba9df157cbd865fb3,,0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-05703-6,Growth tradeoffs produce complex microbial communities on a single limiting resource,"The relationship between the dynamics of a community and its constituent pairwise interactions is a fundamental problem in ecology. Higher-order ecological effects beyond pairwise interactions may be key to complex ecosystems, but mechanisms to produce these effects remain poorly understood. Here we model microbial growth and competition to show that higher-order effects can arise from variation in multiple microbial growth traits, such as lag times and growth rates, on a single limiting resource with no other interactions. These effects produce a range of ecological phenomena: an unlimited number of strains can exhibit multistability and neutral coexistence, potentially with a single keystone strain; strains that coexist in pairs do not coexist all together; and a strain that wins all pairwise competitions can go extinct in a mixed competition. Since variation in multiple growth traits is ubiquitous in microbial populations, our results indicate these higher-order effects may also be widespread, especially in laboratory ecology and evolution experiments. Higher-order interactions occur when one species mediates the interaction between two others. Here, the authors model microbial growth and competition to show that higher-order interactions can arise from tradeoffs in growth traits, leading to neutral coexistence and other complex dynamics.",cc056592e108bab0da9b0922f8bf58aff6e71e91,,0

https://doi.org/10.7551/978-0-262-32621-6-CH005,Coevolution in Hide and Seek: Camouflage and Vision,"Predator-prey interactions are one of the most common coevolutionary dynamics in Nature. We consider a model of the coevolution of prey appearance and predator vision, where a successful result is visually apparent. While using a neurophysiologically-based model of vision and a rich developmental process for prey patterning, we show that predatorprey coevolution can maintain engagement. Backgrounds with large regional differences generally lead to prey that appear as mixtures of the regions. Finally, we find that engagement between predators and prey is supported by greater background complexity. One of the most visually-striking phenomena in predatorprey coevolution is prey crypsis, the ability of prey to avoid detection by predators. Chameleons and cuttlefish take this behavior to the extreme and physically alter their pigmentation to match their environment, which can even be realized synthetically in robots (Morin et al., 2012). However, prey crypsis is often manifested as static pigmentations, such as stationary Turing patterns (Turing, 1952), that are selected for being advantageous in particular environments. Inspired by Bond and Kamil (2002), where blue jays are used to interactively evolve moth phenotypes, we study the effect of background complexity on the coevolution of prey appearance and predator vision. There is an intimate coevolutionary relationship between predator vision and prey appearance. Visual systems are generally adapted for stimuli that exert selective pressure on the organism, such as food, prey, predators, and mates. Even when visual systems have adapted to attenuate visual signals from their relevant stimuli, there is still the challenge of visual attention. Visual attention can be roughly thought of as a way of prioritizing a visual field based on interest. Improper allocation of visual attention can mean the difference between catching dinner or going home hungry. In this research we study the coevolution of prey appearance and visual attention in predators. Prey appearance is evolved via genetic programming, such as in (Sims, 1991a; Reynolds, 2011). Predator vision is evolved using a neurophysiologically-based model of visual attention (Itti and Koch, 2001). We focus on the effects of environmental complexity on this coevolutionary interaction. Merilaita (2003) shows that greater background complexity can increase prey detection times by predators. In even earlier work on background matching in camouflage, it was suggested that visual complexity may favor color polymorphism, because there will often be many polymorphisms that can achieve similar patterns (Endler, 1984). These and other works focus on camouflage via background matching, but there are alternative forms of camouflage, in particular, disruptive colorations. In contrast to background matching, where an entity attempts to blend in with the background, disruptive and distractive colorations are patterns that attempt to draw the observer away from the pattern. Disruptive colorations have been shown to be an effective tool for camouflage when tested against live predators (Schaefer and Stobbe, 2006; Cuthill et al., 2005). A number of visual properties significant to predator-prey interactions have been identified in these contexts, including background complexity, prey contrast, and object density (Dimitrova and Merilaita, 2010, 2012, 2014). In our model, the capacity for complexity in prey is greatly enhanced by utilizing a developmental mechanism to produce color images of moderate dimensions, as compared to previous work which explores the selective favorability of simple patterns (Dimitrova and Merilaita, 2014) or directly-represented greyscale images (Bond and Kamil, 2002). In previous work, we have explored the coevolution of predators and prey (Ficici and Pollack, 1996), finding that such systems are often subject to pathologies such as convergence to mediocre stable states (Ficici and Pollack, 1998), loss of gradient, incorrect focusing, and relativism (Watson and Pollack, 1996). Within the ecology literature, predator-prey systems are commonly studied, including analytical and computational models as well as empirical studies. However, analytical models of predator-prey systems can quickly become infeasible for study as the number of species increases. Furthermore, analysis of phenomena such as predator preference runs into difficulty when accounting for alternative food sources under ecological dynamics (van (a) T = 1 (b) T = 5 (c) T = 10 (d) T = 15 (e) T = 20 (f) T = 25 (g) Prey in context (h) T = 1 (i) T = 5 (j) T = 10 (k) T = 15 (l) T = 20 (m) T = 25 (n) Prey in context (o) T = 1 (p) T = 5 (q) T = 10 (r) T = 15 (s) T = 20 (t) T = 25 (u) Prey in context Figure 1: Time-series of prey morphogenesis. Baalen et al., 2001; Leeuwen and Brännström, 2013). The pathologies of competitive coevolution can be readily explained in the language of predator-prey systems. Loss of gradient, when one population becomes worse such that it no longer exherts selective pressure on the competing population, or better such that the competing population can no longer maintain engagement. Examples of this would include evolutionary advances in a predator-prey ecosystem where prey can achieve greater escape velocities, leading to diminished returns for predators, and in real ecosystems, probably triggering the predators to seek another food source. Incorrect focusing is when members of one population overspecialize in interactions with specific competitors such that they fail to generalize to other competitive interactions and are prone to extinction. Examples of incorrect focusing are not as common in real ecosystems, where a large number of coevolutionary interactions continually apply selective pressure. In competitive coevolutionary interactions, the quality of an individual is a function of its competitors. This relativism in scoring means that an individual that appears to be more fit to an external observer, may be just as fit as a lower quality individual relative to a given set of competitors. In Nature, this is less of an issue for similar reasons to incorrect focusing, there are continual pressures from many aspects of the ecosystem and environment such that these disambiguations will occur infrequently. Predator-Prey Coevolution When simulating predator-prey coevolution, we use a 2population competitive coevolution model. The prey population consists of a set of genetic programs that encode a generative function for their visual appearance. The predator population consists of a set of numerical weights for a saliency detection algorithm. Prey receive points for not being detected, or causing the predator to incorrectly classify the background as prey. Predators receive points based upon the accuracy of how they perceive the environment. There are a number of ways to compute the fitness in coevolving populations. We focus on pairwise competitions. Sims uses best v. best competitive coevolution (Sims, 1994), where each population competes against the best individual of the competing population. However, best v. best can lead to incorrect focusing and disengagement by assigning greater fitness to individuals that overspecialize in defeating the champion competitor. Tournaments can reduce the number of comparisons from O(N) to O(NlogN), but still represent approximations of a full pairwise competition (Angeline and Pollack, 1993). All v. all competitive coevolution reduces the tendency for focusing, but comes at great computational cost. Nevertheless, we compute the complete payoff matrix via all v. all pairwise competitions to facilitate coevolutionary engagement between all species.",cea57702ea9092454b46c8bc83a69d96085f190b,,0

https://doi.org/10.1111/AEC.12379,Trait values and not invasive status determine competitive outcomes between native and invasive species under varying soil nutrient availability,"Invasion by exotic plants is often associated with nutrient enrichment of soils, particularly on soils of naturally low fertility. As a consequence, it is likely that the outcome of competitive interactions between native and invasive plants may be mediated by soil nutrient availability. We independently investigated competitive effect and response as well as the occurrence of asymmetric competition among native and invasive plants on soils of varying nutrient availability, using a glasshouse experiment. Seedlings of eight co-occurring pairs of invasive and native species from low fertility Hawkesbury Sandstone-derived soil were grown under low and high nutrient availability. We tested the hypotheses that native species would be competitively superior at low nutrient availability and have trait values associated with a resource conservation strategy while invasive species would be competitively superior at high nutrient availability and have trait values associated with a resource acquisition strategy. We found that nutrient availability did not mediate competitive interactions between invasive and native species. Instead, two invasive and one native species were always competitively superior irrespective of nutrient availability. Competitively superior species displayed a mixture of both resource conservation and acquisition strategies at low and high nutrient availability. In support of previous studies, we found that the a priori classification of invasive and native species does not predict competitive superiority at varying nutrient levels. Rather, species specific differences in trait values provide a competitive advantage in response to nutrient availability.",d0b9a6330fbf1b2ebf8960ddd3359aa37edb5a9c,,0
https://doi.org/10.1890/07-1066.1,Sex-specific effects of albumen removal and nest environment manipulation on Barn Swallow nestlings.,"In avian species, maternal provisioning to the eggs is predicted to be more valuable for the offspring under adverse environmental conditions and intense sibling competition. However, studies manipulating both the amount of maternal pre-hatching resources and the harshness of post-hatching environment have seldom been performed to date. In this experimental study of Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) nestlings, we tested the consequences of a reduction in the albumen content of the eggs for fitness-related offspring traits, while performing an unbalanced partial cross-fostering soon after hatching, either increasing or decreasing brood size by one nestling. By molecular sexing of the chicks, we additionally tested for sex-specific sensitivity of individual nestlings to experimental treatments and to sex ratio variation in nestmates. We predicted that chicks hatching from albumen-deprived eggs should suffer more than control chicks from the harsher rearing conditions of enlarged broods. However, although albumen removal depressed chick body mass, chicks hatching from control eggs did not fare better than those hatching from eggs with reduced albumen content in enlarged vs. reduced broods. Albumen removal had sex-specific effects on immunity, with males, but not females, hatching from eggs with reduced albumen content showing a lower T-cell-mediated immune response than controls, suggesting that the two sexes were differentially susceptible to resource deprivation during early ontogeny. In addition, both immune response and chick body mass at age 7 days, when maximum growth rate is attained, declined with an increasing proportion of male nestmates. The effect of brood size manipulation on chick body mass at age 12 days, when peak body mass is attained, was also found to depend on brood sex composition, in that an increase in the proportion of male nestmates depressed offspring body mass in reduced broods, while the reverse was true in enlarged broods. On the whole, these findings suggest that sex differences may exist in environmental sensitivity and patterns of resource allocation among different body functions, and that brood size variation and sex composition may affect offspring fitness-related traits.",d3c6d30687ec906726211d5841b27da9b955ecd7,,0

https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13082,Abiotic heterogeneity underlies trait‐based competition and assembly,"The fitness of individual species depends on their ability to persist and establish at low densities, just as the diversity of ecological communities depends on the establishment and persistence of low‐density, “invader” species. Theory predicts that abiotic conditions and the competitive make‐up of resident communities jointly shape invader fitness, limiting the phenotypic identity of successful invaders. We use an invasion experiment to ask how competitive traits of 20 introduced plant species alter their absolute fitness in fragments that differ in size, abiotic conditions, and traits of the resident community. We show that abiotic conditions interact with both invader traits and resident functional diversity to determine invader survival. Optimal invader traits depended on the soil characteristics, while greater resident trait diversity lowered invader fitness and had especially strong effects in low‐resource environments. Unlike other abiotic conditions, fragment size had consistent effects irrespective of invader identity, decreasing survival in larger fragments. Synthesis. Our results illustrate how the abiotic environment mediates the effects of resident and invader traits on establishment, creating fitness landscapes that structure local diversity and the functional identities of successful species.",d6be4b430f00d79fef9af4271fe5e1d36e3b3352,,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.12996,Robustness of trait connections across environmental gradients and growth forms,"Aim: Plant trait databases often contain traits that are correlated, but for whom direct (undirected statistical dependency) and indirect (mediated by other traits) connections may be confounded. The confounding of correlation and connection hinders our understanding of plant strategies, and how these vary among growth forms and climate zones. We identified the direct and indirect connections across plant traits relevant to competition, resource acquisition and reproductive strategies using a global database and explored whether connections within and between traits from different tissue types vary across climates and growth forms. Location: Global. Major taxa studied: Plants. Time period: Present. Methods: We used probabilistic graphical models and a database of 10 plant traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, mass- and area-based leaf nitrogen and phosphorous content, leaf life span, plant height, stem specific density and seed mass) with 16,281 records to describe direct and indirect connections across woody and non-woody plants across tropical, temperate, arid, cold and polar regions. Results: Trait networks based on direct connections are sparser than those based on correlations. Land plants had high connectivity across traits within and between tissue types; leaf life span and stem specific density shared direct connections with all other traits. For both growth forms, two groups of traits form modules of more highly connected traits; one related to resource acquisition, the other to plant architecture and reproduction. Woody species had higher trait network modularity in polar compared to temperate and tropical climates, while non-woody species did not show significant differences in modularity across climate regions. Main conclusions: Plant traits are highly connected both within and across tissue types, yet traits segregate into persistent modules of traits. Variation in the modularity of trait networks suggests that trait connectivity is shaped by prevailing environmental conditions and demonstrates that plants of different growth forms use alternative strategies to cope with local conditions.",d806432fe049f25e03abeefeee62050187a0234e,,0

https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.13244,Leaf trait variation in grassland plant species in response to soil phosphorus,"Increased soil phosphorus (P) availability in fertilized grasslands can drive both community degradation and delayed community recovery upon agricultural abandonment. Beyond describing grassland community patterns along gradients in P availability, it remains unclear how individual species with different strategies respond to increasing phosphorus. Here we studied intraspecific variability of leaf functional traits in response to soil phosphorus, for species with contrasting resource‐use strategies.We set up a pot experiment with communities containing four species, assembled from a pool of 20 mesotrophic grassland species growing along a soil P gradient. Species selection included various growth forms (grasses vs forbs) and resource‐use strategies (acquisitive vs conservative resource use). We measured three variables characterizing the (a)biotic environmental context: bioavailable soil P concentration, total community biomass as a proxy for the intensity of competition, and the proportional biomass of a species in the community as a proxy for its competitive dominance. We investigated the effect of this environmental context on the expression of two leaf traits, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC).We found an acquisitive trait expression within species (increase in SLA and decrease in LDMC) in response to increased soil P supply and a conservative trait expression (decrease in SLA and increase in LDMC) in response to an increase in total community biomass. Importantly, the trait responses to the environmental context were generally consistent for species representing very different resource‐use strategies and growth forms.Species responded with a shift from an acquisitive to a conservative trait expression in response to limited resources; i.e., driven by a decrease in soil phosphorus concentration or an increase in total community biomass. Unexpectedly, the intraspecific variability in response to the changing environmental conditions was not clearly mediated by the species’ strategy. These findings show that plant ecological strategies are probably not the main driver for intraspecific trait variability in an experimental grassland community.",d8e3c0d5c7ba1d8dbdc4cb2115efe8911b506679,,0
https://doi.org/10.1086/700314,"Herkogamy, a Principal Functional Trait of Plant Reproductive Biology","Premise of research. Phenotypic traits that consistently mediate species’ responses to environmental variation (functional traits) provide a promising approach toward generalizing ecological and evolutionary patterns and thereby gaining insights into the processes generating them. In the plant functional ecology literature, most trait-based studies have focused on traits mediating either resource competition or responses to variation in the abiotic environment, while traits mediating reproductive interactions have often been neglected. Methodology. Here, I discuss the value of herkogamy, the spatial separation of male and female functions in flowers, as a functional trait in plant reproductive biology and review the evidence relevant to the hypothesis that taxa exhibiting greater herkogamy have historically experienced more reliable pollination and more outcrossed mating systems. Pivotal results. A large body of work in the field of plant reproductive biology has identified a set of nearly ubiquitous correlations between average herkogamy and features of plant mating systems, notably, autofertility (seed set in the absence of pollinators) and outcrossing rate. Herkogamy often varies extensively among populations and species, and the adaptive interpretation is that herkogamy exhibits local adaptation to the reliability of the pollination environment. Conclusions. These results underline the value of herkogamy as a functional trait representing variation in mating histories. Many important insights are likely to emerge from studies leveraging herkogamy as an easily measured proxy of plant mating systems, as already demonstrated in comparative studies and studies of reproductive interactions. Greater consideration of herkogamy and other reproductive-function traits in studies of species coexistence may provide a more complete understanding of community assembly processes.",d93fecf00af5b249778476e7d6fdbfc87bf4d604,,0

Here, in order to examine whether competition mechanisms can affect the foraging behaviour of wild Salmo trutta with respect to active-bottom, benthic-drift or surface-drift foraging, three neighbouring populations under different levels of fish density (high, intermediate and low) were studied. We analysed the foraging behaviour of each population according to niche breadth, prey preferences, the modified Costello graphical method and prey trait analysis. The results revealed a remarkable similarity in the feeding behaviour among these feral fish populations, suggesting a foraging behaviour convergence in response to site-specific prey accessibility. A generalist foraging behaviour was the prevailing feeding strategy, independent of fish density. Hence, this study offered evidence for the occurrence of density-independent individual foraging behaviour when food is abundant and available; however, density-dependent foraging behaviour might occur when resource limitation exists. Studies under natural conditions like the present study are needed to increase ecological realism, and indeed this study opens promising research directions for future feeding studies in territorial fish species.",d9cac459c49c4f69317802d3e1bb88c94f9c5ef2,,0

These include patterns of resource use and limitation, spatial heterogeneities, drift and migration. Pathogen strains co-circulating in a host population are a special type of an ecological community. They compete for colonization of susceptible hosts, and sometimes interact via altered susceptibilities to co-colonization. Diversity in such pairwise interaction traits enables the multiple strains to create dynamically their niches for growth and persistence, and ‘engineer’ their common environment. How such a network of interactions with others mediates collective coexistence remains puzzling analytically and computationally difficult to simulate. Furthermore, the gradients modulating stability-complexity regimes in such multi-player systems remain poorly understood. In a recent study, we presented an analytic framework for N-type coexistence in an SIS epidemiological system with co-colonization interactions. The multi-strain complexity was reduced from O(N2) dimensions of population structure to only N equations for strain frequency evolution on a long timescale. Here, we examine the key drivers of coexistence regimes in such a system. We find the ratio of single to co-colonization μ critically determines the type of equilibrium for multi-strain dynamics. This key quantity in the model encodes a trade-off between overall transmission intensity R0 and mean interaction coefficient in strain space k. Preserving a given coexistence regime, under fixed trait variation, can only be achieved from a balance between higher competition in favourable environments, and higher cooperation in harsher environments, consistent with the stress gradient hypothesis in ecology. Multi-strain coexistence regimes are more stable when μ is small, whereas as μ increases, dynamics tends to increase in complexity. There is an intermediate ratio that maximizes the existence and stability of a unique coexistence equilibrium between strains. This framework provides a foundation for linking invariant principles in collective coexistence across biological systems, and for understanding critical shifts in community dynamics, driven by simple and random pairwise interactions but potentiated by mean-field and environmental gradients.",dec058351d6092fb60d2abbfc7de8b6c9869e7b7,,0

However, empirical evidence for this trade-off is mixed, raising questions about the extent to which it shapes diverse ecological communities. Here we outline a framework that can be used to improve empirical tests of the competition-colonization trade-off. We argue that tests of the competition-colonization trade-off have been diverted into unproductive paths when dispersal mode and/or competition type have been inadequately defined. To generate comparative predictions of associations between dispersal and competitive performance, we develop a conceptual trait-based framework that clarifies how dispersal mode and type of competitor shape this trade-off at the stage of dispersal and establishment in a variety of systems. Our framework suggests that competition-colonization trade-offs may be less common for passively dispersing organisms when competitive dominants are those best able to withstand resource depletion (competitive response), and for active dispersers when traits for dispersal performance are positively associated with resource pre-emption (competitive effect). The framework presented here is designed to provide common ground for researchers working in different systems in order to prompt more effective assessment of this performance trade-off and its role in shaping community structure. By delineating key system properties that mediate the trade-off between competitive and colonization performance and their relationship to individual-level traits, researchers in disparate systems can structure their predictions about this trade-off more effectively and compare across systems more clearly.",df3f179616fd405d7dd7f7758bec040eb7c1e49d,,0

Ecological processes, in particular negative indirect effects mediated by shared natural enemies (apparent competition), may be important in structuring phytophagous insect communities. The potential for indirect interactions can be assessed by analyzing the trophic structure of insect communities, and we claim that quantitative food webs are particularly well suited for this task. We review the experimental evidence for both short-term and long-term apparent competition in phytophagous insect communities and discuss the possible interactions between apparent competition and intraguild predation or shared mutualists.

Here, we offer an alternative framework where virulent immune-provoking behaviours and enhanced immune resistance are joint tactics of invading pathogens to eliminate resident competitors (transferring resources from resident to invading pathogen). The pathogen wins by creating a novel immunological challenge to which it is already adapted. We analyse a general ecological model of ‘proactive invasion’ where invaders not adapted to a local environment can succeed by changing it to one where they are better adapted than residents. However, the two-trait nature of the ‘proactive’ strategy (provocation of, and adaptation to environmental change) presents an evolutionary conundrum, as neither trait alone is favoured in a homogenous host population. We show that this conundrum can be resolved by allowing for host heterogeneity. We relate our model to emerging empirical findings on immunological mediation of parasite competition.",e34b6aa506a2b708acd53876f38f7358e45fa6ab,,0

To date, this work has primarily focused on the effects of predator-induced behavioral plasticity on communities. However, predator-induced morphological plasticity, which has been documented in many taxa, might also lead to trait-mediated indirect effects. Here, I examined how predators altered the behavior and morphology of larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and leopard frogs (R. pipiens) and how these phenotypic changes altered the outcome of competition between the two species. 
 
Competition in the absence of caged predators was asymmetric; when reared separately, leopard frogs grew more than wood frogs, but when competing (without predators), wood frogs grew faster than leopard frogs. The presence of caged predators reversed the outcome of competition between the two anuran prey. In the presence of larval dragonflies (Anax spp.) or caged mudminnows (Umbra limi), leopard frogs grew faster than wood frogs while total tadpole biomass production remained unchanged. Thus, there was a predator-mediated indirect effect. 
 
Because predators alter both the behavior and morphology of larval anurans and both of these traits are known to affect resource consumption and growth, both are potential mechanisms to explain the change in competitive outcome. Changes in behavior were not related to changes in growth, but changes in morphology (specifically mouth width and tail length) were related to changes in growth. When competitors were added (without predators), wood frogs increased their mouth width by 10% and their tail length by 3%, while leopard frogs increased their mouth width by 5% and did not change their tail length. The greater increase in mouth width for wood frogs should increase their forage intake, since tadpoles feed by scraping periphyton; the importance of a 3% longer tail in competitive ability is unknown. The presence of the predator threat (via chemical cues from the caged predators) reduced both the mouth width and tail length in the two prey species to pre-competition levels. This response corresponded with the reduced competitive ability of the wood frogs. This work demonstrates that both competitors and predators can alter prey morphology and suggests that changes in morphology can cause trait-mediated indirect effects.",e4d8a15a418be329b5684ad74502f3627fd762dd,,0

https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2904,Disturbance size and frequency mediate the coexistence of benthic spatial competitors.,"Disturbance plays a key role in structuring community dynamics and is central to conservation and natural resource management. However, ecologists continue to debate the importance of disturbance for species coexistence and biodiversity. Such disagreements may arise in part because few studies have examined variation across multiple dimensions of disturbance (e.g., size, frequency) and how the effects of disturbance may depend on species attributes (e.g., competitiveness, dispersal ability). In light of this gap in understanding and accelerating changes to disturbance regimes worldwide, we used spatial population models to explore how disturbance size and frequency interact with species attributes to affect coexistence between seagrass (Zostera marina) and colonial burrowing shrimp (Neotrypaea californiensis) that compete for benthic space in estuaries throughout the west coast of North America. By simulating population dynamics under a range of ecologically-relevant disturbance regimes, we discovered that intermediate disturbance (approximately 9-23% of landscape area per year) to short-dispersing, competitively-dominant seagrass can foster long-term stable coexistence with broad-dispersing, competitively-inferior burrowing shrimp via the spatial storage effect. When holding the total extent of disturbance constant, the individual size and annual frequency of disturbance altered landscape spatial patterns and mediated the dominance and evenness of competitors. Many small disturbances favored short-dispersing seagrass by hastening recolonization, whereas fewer large disturbances benefitted rapidly-colonizing burrowing shrimp by creating temporary refugia from competition. As a result, large, infrequent disturbances generally improved the strength and stability of coexistence relative to small, frequent disturbances. Regardless of disturbance size or frequency, the dispersal ability of the superior competitor (seagrass), the competitive ability the inferior competitor (burrowing shrimp), and the reproduction and survival of both species strongly influenced population abundances and coexistence. Our results show that disturbance size and frequency can promote or constrain coexistence by altering the duration of time over which inferior competitors can escape competitive exclusion, particularly when colonization depends on the spatial pattern of disturbance due to dispersal traits. For coastal managers and conservation practitioners, our findings indicate that reducing particularly large disturbances may help conserve globally-imperiled seagrass meadows and control burrowing shrimp colonies that can threaten the viability of oyster aquaculture.",e7d0fd3c13b253fd4ccede50698faf6505e2505a,,0

https://doi.org/10.25932/PUBLISHUP-47941,Using individual-based modeling to understand grassland diversity and resilience in the Anthropocene,"The world’s grassland systems are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic change. Susceptible to a variety of different stressors, from land-use intensification to climate change, understanding the mechanisms driving the maintenance of these systems’ biodiversity and stability, and how these mechanisms may shift under human-mediated disturbance, is thus critical for successfully navigating the next century. Within this dissertation, I use an individual-based and spatially-explicit model of grassland community assembly (IBC-grass) to examine several processes, thought key to understanding their biodiversity and stability and how it changes under stress. In the first chapter of my thesis, I examine the conditions under which intraspecific trait variation influences the diversity of simulated grassland communities. In the second and third chapters of my thesis, I shift focus towards understanding how belowground herbivores influence the stability of these grassland systems to either a disturbance that results in increased, stochastic, plant mortality, or eutrophication. 
Intraspecific trait variation (ITV), or variation in trait values between individuals of the same species, is fundamental to the structure of ecological communities. However, because it has historically been difficult to incorporate into theoretical and statistical models, it has remained largely overlooked in community-level analyses. This reality is quickly shifting, however, as a consensus of research suggests that it may compose a sizeable proportion of the total variation within an ecological community and that it may play a critical role in determining if species coexist. Despite this increasing awareness that ITV matters, there is little consensus of the magnitude and direction of its influence. Therefore, to better understand how ITV changes the assembly of grassland communities, in the first chapter of my thesis, I incorporate it into an established, individual-based grassland community model, simulating both pairwise invasion experiments as well as the assembly of communities with varying initial diversities. By varying the amount of ITV in these species’ functional traits, I examine the magnitude and direction of ITV’s influence on pairwise invasibility and community coexistence. During pairwise invasion, ITV enables the weakest species to more frequently invade the competitively superior species, however, this influence does not generally scale to the community level. Indeed, unless the community has low alpha- and beta- diversity, there will be little effect of ITV in bolstering diversity. In these situations, since the trait axis is sparsely filled, the competitively inferior may suffer less competition and therefore ITV may buffer the persistence and abundance of these species for some time. 
In the second and third chapters of my thesis, I model how one of the most ubiquitous trophic interactions within grasslands, herbivory belowground, influences their diversity and stability. Until recently, the fundamental difficulty in studying a process within the soil has left belowground herbivory “out of sight, out of mind.” This dilemma presents an opportunity for simulation models to explore how this understudied process may alter community dynamics. In the second chapter of my thesis, I implement belowground herbivory – represented by the weekly removal of plant biomass – into IBC-grass. Then, by introducing a pulse disturbance, modelled as the stochastic mortality of some percentage of the plant community, I observe how the presence of belowground herbivores influences the resistance and recovery of Shannon diversity in these communities. I find that high resource, low diversity, communities are significantly more destabilized by the presence of belowground herbivores after disturbance. Depending on the timing of the disturbance and whether the grassland’s seed bank persists for more than one season, the impact of the disturbance – and subsequently the influence of the herbivores – can be greatly reduced. However, because human-mediated eutrophication increases the amount of resources in the soil, thus pressuring grassland systems, our results suggest that the influence of these herbivores may become more important over time. 
In the third chapter of my thesis, I delve further into understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of belowground herbivores on the diversity of grasslands by replicating an empirical mesocosm experiment that crosses the presence of herbivores above- and below-ground with eutrophication. I show that while aboveground herbivory, as predicted by theory and frequently observed in experiments, mitigates the impact of eutrophication on species diversity, belowground herbivores counterintuitively reduce biodiversity. Indeed, this influence positively interacts with the eutrophication process, amplifying its negative impact on diversity. I discovered the mechanism underlying this surprising pattern to be that, as the herbivores consume roots, they increase the proportion of root resources to root biomass. Because root competition is often symmetric, herbivory fails to mitigate any asymmetries in the plants’ competitive dynamics. However, since the remaining roots have more abundant access to resources, the plants’ competition shifts aboveground, towards asymmetric competition for light. This leads the community towards a low-diversity state, composed of mostly high-performance, large plant species. We further argue that this pattern will emerge unless the plants’ root competition is asymmetric, in which case, like its counterpart aboveground, belowground herbivory may buffer diversity by reducing this asymmetry between the competitively superior and inferior plants. 
I conclude my dissertation by discussing the implications of my research on the state of the art in intraspecific trait variation and belowground herbivory, with emphasis on the necessity of more diverse theory development in the study of these fundamental interactions. My results suggest that the influence of these processes on the biodiversity and stability of grassland systems is underappreciated and multidimensional, and must be thoroughly explored if researchers wish to predict how the world’s grasslands will respond to anthropogenic change. Further, should researchers myopically focus on understanding central ecological interactions through only mathematically tractable analyses, they may miss entire suites of potential coexistence mechanisms that can increase the coviability of species, potentially leading to coexistence over ecologically-significant timespans. Individual-based modelling, therefore, with its focus on individual interactions, will prove a critical tool in the coming decades for understanding how local interactions scale to larger contexts, and how these interactions shape ecological communities and further predicting how these systems will change under human-mediated stress.",ea3ad0d7899f608ee0ea0442a051ef59bad056c2,,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/nrm.12076,Evolutionarily induced alternative states and coexistence in systems with apparent competition,"Predators often consume multiple prey and by mutually subsidizing a shared predator, the prey may reciprocally harm each other. When predation levels are high, this apparent competition can culminate in a prey species being displaced. Coupling quantitative genetics and Lotka-Volterra models, we study how predator evolution alters this and other ecological outcomes. These models account for a trade-off between the predator’s attack rates on two prey species. We provide a mathematical characterization of a strong form of persistence–permanence–for which there is a global attractor bounded away from extinction. When the evolutionary dynamics occur at a sufficiently slower time scale than the ecological dynamics, we also characterize attractors and their basins’ of attraction using singular perturbation theory and a graphical approach to the eco-evolutionary dynamics. Our results show that eco-evolutionary feedbacks can mediate permanence at intermediate trade-offs in the attack rates. However, at strong trade-offs, permanence is lost. Despite this loss of permanence, there can be attractors supporting coexistence. These attractors, however, may coincide with attractors at which the predator is excluded. Our results highlight that evo-evolutionary feedbacks can alter community structure by mediating coexistence or leading to trait-dependent alternative stable states.",ecd71d34e2daee066f8a6b7241d843f3256d31c0,,0

Biocontrol insects can integrate into food webs within recipient habitats and influence native insects through apparent competition (altering shared natural enemies) or density‐mediated exploitation competition (changing density of native plants). However, whether and how trait‐mediated exploitation competition (modifying native plant chemicals and volatiles profiles) can produce indirect non‐target effects remains largely overlooked, despite plant phenotypic responses to insect herbivory being common and widely documented. The flea beetle Agasicles hygrophila was introduced into China for management of alligator weed Alternanthera philoxeroides, but it also attacks the native congener sessile joyweed Alternanthera sessilis, which may cause indirect non‐target effects on the native tortoise beetle Cassida piperata that also feeds on sessile joyweed. Here, we examined the relationships among abundances of the flea beetle and tortoise beetle, and coverage of sessile joyweed in the field. Then, we investigated the impact of flea beetle herbivory on tortoise beetle development and oviposition, as well as on sessile joyweed primary metabolites and leaf volatiles. Tortoise beetle abundance was not related to sessile joyweed coverage, but they were less abundant on plants with more flea beetles in the field survey, and produced fewer offspring on plants with more prior flea beetle damage in the field cage experiment. Tortoise beetle development was inhibited by prior flea beetle herbivory in bioassays in enemy‐free conditions and they preferred to oviposit on sessile joyweed that had experienced little or no flea beetle damage. Flea beetle herbivory decreased sessile joyweed foliar glucose and protein, and substantially changed its leaf volatile blend. Synthesis. Our results show that the flea beetle has major indirect non‐target effects on the tortoise beetle through trait‐mediated exploitation competition, rather than apparent competition or density‐mediated exploitation competition. Our results demonstrate a new example for indirect non‐target effects of biocontrol agents. Furthermore, our results indicate that minor brief negative impacts of biocontrol agents on non‐target plants might propagate to higher trophic levels and such negative impacts can strengthen with increasing intensity of the direct non‐target effect.",ee833416c494b3af18c5e8cbb884a679635f2c72,,0

While it is recognized that competition is sensitive to environmental conditions, it is unclear to what extent this mediated by the availability of different carbon resources. Here, we used a model laboratory system to directly test this by exploring how carbon resource richness and identity shape resource competition and antibiosis between plant probiotic Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and phytopathogenic Ralstonia solanacearum bacteria. We found that while sugars typically promoted B. amyloliquefaciens growth, organic and amino acids increased the production of both bacillaene and macrolactin antibiotics and the direct inhibition of R. solanacearum. In contrast, when multiple different carbon resources were available, B. amyloliquefaciens could efficiently grow and produce antibiotics at the same time. Together, these results suggest that high carbon resource richness allows concurrent expression of growth- and antibiosis-related traits, potentially altering bacterial competitive dynamics and plant growth promotion in microbial communities.

Our previous work found that diploid individuals repeatedly arose within ten replicate haploid populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and in each case we witnessed diploid takeover within 1800 asexual generations of batch culture evolution in the lab. The character that allowed diploids to rise in frequency within haploid populations remains unknown. Here we present a number of experiments conducted with the goal to determine what this trait (or traits) might have been. Experiments were conducted both by sampling a small number of colonies from the stocks frozen every two weeks (93 generations) during the original experiment, as well through sampling a larger number of colonies at the two time points where polymorphism for ploidy was most prevalent. Surprisingly, none of our fitness component measures (lag phase, growth rate, biomass production) indicated an advantage to diploidy. Similarly, competition assays against a common competitor and direct competition between haploid and diploid colonies isolated from the same time point failed to indicate a diploid advantage. Furthermore, we uncovered a tremendous amount of trait variation among colonies of the same ploidy level. Only late-appearing diploids showed a competitive advantage over haploids, indicating that the fitness advantage that allowed eventual takeover was not diploidy per se but an attribute of a subset of diploid lineages. Nevertheless, the initial rise in diploids to intermediate frequency cannot be explained by any of the fitness measures used; we suggest that the resolution to this mystery is negative frequency-dependent selection, which is ignored in the standard fitness measures used.",eed9dab92d7dcb4ce77af06357c96fd9173c0d0e,,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13028,Host traits and competitive ability jointly structure disease dynamics and community assembly.,"Parasitism and competition are both ubiquitous interactions in ecological communities. The ability of host species to interact directly via competition and indirectly through shared parasites suggests that host traits related to competition and parasitism are likely important in structuring communities and disease dynamics. Specifically, those host traits affecting competition and those mediating parasitism are often correlated either because of trade-offs (in resource acquisition or resource allocation) or condition dependence, yet the consequences of these trait relationships for community and epidemiological dynamics are poorly understood. We conducted a literature review of parasite-related host traits-competitive ability relationships. We found that transmission-competitive ability relationships were most often reported, and that superior competitors exhibited elevated transmission relative to their less-competitive counterparts in nearly 80% of the cases. We also found a significant number of virulence-competitive ability and parasite shedding-competitive ability relationships. We investigated these links by altering the relationship between host competitive ability and three parasite-related traits (transmission, virulence and parasite shedding rates) in a simple model, incorporating competitive asymmetries in a multi-host community. We show that these relationships can lead to a range of different communities. For example, depending on the strength and direction of these distinct trait relationships, we observed communities with anywhere from high parasite prevalence to complete parasite extinction, and either one, two or the maximum of three host species coexisting. Our results suggest that parasite-competitive ability relationships may be common in nature, that further integration of these relationships can produce novel and unexpected community and disease dynamics, and that generalizations may allow for the prediction of how parasitism and competition jointly structure disease and diversity in natural communities.",f0df51d9c947b2b8f3e6a5884bcf8c83ab27ce61,,0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.70039,Coexistence of coinvading species with mutualism and competition,"Abstract All interactions between multiple species invading together (coinvasion) must be accounted for to predict species coexistence patterns across space. Mutualisms, particularly, are known to influence species' population dynamics and their invasive ability (e.g., mycorrhizal fungi with partner plants). Yet, while modeling coinvasion, their role in mediating coexistence is overlooked. Here, we build a spatially explicit model of coinvasion of two competing plant species with a shared fungal mutualist to study how mutualism and competition interact to shape the local and regional coexistence of competitors. We observe four main results. First, mutualist presence generates regional coexistence between competitors even when local coexistence between them is impossible. Second, increasing partner mutualist dispersal leads to abrupt changes in competitor coexistence outcomes. Third, differences in mutualist partner dependence and competitive ability interact to produce a variety of local and regional coexistence outcomes. Fourth, asymmetry in the dispersal ability arising from dependence‐dispersal trade‐offs leads to greater exclusion of species less dependent on mutualist partners for growth. In toto, incorporating mutualism‐specific trait trade‐offs and dispersal asymmetries into coinvasion models offers new insights into regional coexistence and invasive species distributions.",f14b0dd3d54eded3b876083986fa574080bdb6e9,,0

A new hypothesis for the functional role of diversity in mediating resource pools and weed–crop competition in agroecosystems. Weed Research.50, 37–48. 
 
Summary 
We develop a new conceptual model we call the Resource Pool Diversity Hypothesis (RPDH) aimed at explaining how soil resource pool diversity may mediate competition for soil resources between weeds and crops. The primary tenets of the RPDH are that (i) in plant communities, the intensity of inter-specific competition can depend upon the degree to which niche differentiation and resource partitioning occur among species, (ii) agricultural systems are unique in that management practices, such as crop rotation, source of fertility and weed management, result in inputs to the soil and (iii) these inputs directly or indirectly become soil resource pools from which crops and weeds may partition resources. The RPDH leads to the novel prediction that along a gradient of increasing cropping system diversity, yield loss due to weed–crop competition (i.e. the impact on yield per unit weed density) for soil resources should decrease. Similarly, the degree to which crops and weeds overlap in soil resource niche breadth (which is determined by species-specific functional traits for resource acquisition), will determine the extent to which weed–crop competition weakens as resource pool diversity increases. While there have been no direct tests of the RPDH, we highlight evidence from the agricultural literature that provides strong support for components of the hypothesis. Validation of the RPDH would have important implications across a broad range of cropping systems for the development of management strategies that aim to reduce yield loss impact per unit weed plant density and the fundamental principles of integrated weed management, such as the concepts of weed thresholds and critical periods.",f4cbaede88f9eccddf00410580c0663573a296e9,,0

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000398,Invaders on the Wing,"​TheThe deliberate or accidental introduction of species beyond their natural range has been one of the major consequences of the growth of trade, travel, and tourism in recent times. Many introduced species fail to establish or to spread significantly, but many others become successful invaders. Invasive alien species can transform natural ecosystems and cause extinctions of native species. As a result, invasive species are now recognized in the IUCN Red List as one of the main threats to native biodiversity worldwide. In some parts of the world, especially on oceanic islands and previously isolated landmasses, they are arguably now a more important threat than factors such as habitat loss or overexploitation, which tend to preoccupy conservationists in continental landscapes that humans have modified over thousands of years. For example, in New Zealand there is now a major “biosecurity” focus on preventing new invasions, eradicating introduced mammals from offshore islands, and managing a suite of invasive species on the mainland.

To deal effectively with invasive species, it is clearly important to understand the processes of biological invasion. If, by studying the “unnatural experiments” of past species introductions, insights can also gained into fundamental ecological processes, so much the better. 
 
Although birds are very well-studied in many other contexts and are a common cause of conservation concern, they have received relatively little attention as biological invaders, compared with mammals, for example. This is despite the fact that the history and success or failure of avian introductions around the world is relatively well-documented. Since there is also a large amount of information on the distribution, ecology, and evolution of birds in general, this means that exotic birds provide excellent opportunities for examining the major stages of biological invasion and addressing important questions about the factors that facilitate invasions. The new book Avian Invasions: The Ecology and Evolution of Exotic Birds, by Tim Blackburn, Julie Lockwood, and Phillip Cassey, is therefore very timely and topical in its synthesis of the hitherto neglected subjects of the ecology and evolution of exotic birds. 
 
The book is structured around widely accepted stages of the invasion pathway: transport and introduction, establishment, spread, and invasive impact. It concludes with chapters on the ecology, genetics, and evolution of exotic birds, and lessons learned from the study of avian invasions. Throughout the book, the authors not only critically review the existing literature on biological invasions in general and avian invasions in particular; they also make several excellent suggestions for future research. 
 
The book starts with a brief but interesting history of bird introductions and a summary of the general invasion pathway. From the outset, the authors point out some of the problems in trying to draw scientific conclusions from historical data, which are often biased in terms of taxon, location, and time period. The bird species chosen for introduction reflected societal demands at the time, with the result that more than half of all known avian introductions come from only five families, which contain less than 15% of extant birds. Gamebirds, parrots, and passerines are over-represented among introduced birds because they were disproportionately selected for introduction as hunting quarry, as ornamental species, or as songbirds. Common bird species may also have been more likely to be successfully introduced; for example, common British birds were introduced to New Zealand in larger numbers. Overall, more than two thirds of bird introductions have been to islands, which comprise only a small fraction of the world's land area, and a disproportionate number of introductions have been made to Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands. Despite such shortcomings in the historical data, the authors illustrate throughout the book how the rigorous analysis of past introductions can still yield some powerful insights into invasion processes. 
 
The first two stages of the invasion pathway are transport and introduction. These are considered together as the subject of the second chapter, with a focus on evidence for non-randomness in both stages. The authors point out that a consistent thread running through analyses of character selectivity is that the “availability” of a species is important for its success; large geographic range size and/or population size are predictors of transport and introduction probability. 
 
The third stage of invasion is the crucial one of establishment, and this is the subject of chapters 3–5, which progressively consider the roles of contingency, species traits, and location in relation to establishment success. It is widely agreed that “propagule pressure” (usually defined as the number of individuals introduced) is an important determinant of success. The authors argue why this would be expected, relating it to the challenges faced by small populations in general and presenting evidence for the relationship between propagule pressure and establishment success. They then go on to consider the role of species-level traits, where previous studies have generally failed to find associations with establishment success. By framing this issue in the context of small population biology, they successfully argue that general conclusions can be drawn about the importance of factors such as population growth rates, Allee effects (reduced population growth at low densities), and abilities to cope with novelty, in relation to the likelihood of successful establishment. Chapter 5 discusses the importance of recipient location, including the historically controversial topics of invasibility and the role of competition in determining establishment success. The authors successfully revisit these arguments and also address the other important biotic interactions of predation, parasitism, and mutualisms (such as pollination and seed dispersal). 
 
After establishment, the next phase of the invasion process is spread (which is discussed in Chapter 6). The authors review the general literature on geographic range expansion of invasive species and note the strong bias in substantial data from a few widespread and highly successful bird species (such as starlings and sparrows). Despite the taxonomic bias, this is a key area in which data on exotic birds have contributed substantially to our current understanding of one of the major stages of biological invasion. 
 
In the second part of the book, the authors move beyond the invasion pathway to consider the ecology, genetics, and evolution of exotic birds, lessons learned from the study of avian invasions, and some of the exciting research opportunities that they present. They review information on interactions between exotic birds and native species and consider how comparing data on phenomena, such as species-area relationships and latitudinal gradients of exotic and native birds, can contribute to general ecological understanding. For example, whereas native bird species richness on islands is a negative function of distance to the mainland, exotic bird species richness is a positive function of this distance because of where exotic species were introduced. The authors then summarise what is known about the impacts of exotic birds on native species and communities (i.e., effectively the final stage of the invasion pathway). These impacts include competition with native birds, predation, mutualisms (such as pollination and seed dispersal), and the role of exotic birds in disease transmission. Classic examples include the pollination and dispersal of native and introduced plant species by exotic birds in many ecosystems and the devastating transmission of avian malaria and avian pox from exotic birds to vulnerable native bird species in Hawaii. 
 
Chapters 8 and 9 take the longer-term, evolutionary perspective on the effects of successful avian invasions. Exotic birds have sometimes lost significant amounts of genetic variation during the introduction process, but in many cases there is no evidence of any such loss. There is, however, some evidence of evolution in phenotypes of exotic birds since they have established at new sites, despite the relatively short time frames involved. As is stressed by the authors, the “experiments in nature” represented by avian invasions, provide multiple (but so far under-utilized) opportunities for addressing basic questions in evolutionary ecology. 
 
The authors conclude their book by stating that a coherent picture is beginning to emerge of how introduced bird species move through stages of the invasion process. Significant and consistent themes include the role of humans; interactions between event, species, and location; and the importance of both the stochastic and the deterministic in the establishment and spread of exotic birds. They strongly advocate the use of transport/introduction patterns as null hypotheses in invasion ecology, suggesting that ecological explanations are needed when there is deviation from these human-mediated patterns. 
 
Overall, this is a comprehensive, up-to-date, and exciting book. It provides a much-needed stimulus for a greater focus on avian invasions and their effects on native biodiversity, but it also illustrates how the study of exotic birds can help to advance our general understanding of invasion ecology. I predict that it will become a classic text in invasion ecology, and I strongly commend it to all who are interested in this important and growing field.",f6ca8686ca291f9923f1d89fba05a32e1e2ed5a7,,0

RCA-silenced plants are impaired not only in photosynthetic capacity and growth, but also in jasmonic acid-isoleucine (JA-Ile) signaling, and herbivore resistance mediated by JA-Ile-dependent defense traits. These responses are consistent with a resource-based growth-defense trade-off. • As JA + Ile supplementation of OS restored wild-type (WT) levels of JA-Ile, defenses and resistance to M. sexta, but OS supplemented individually with JA or Ile did not, the JA-Ile deficiency of RCA-silenced plants could not be attributed to lower JA or Ile pools or JAR4/6 conjugating activity. Similar levels of JA-Ile derivatives after OS elicitation indicated unaltered JA-Ile turnover, and lower levels of other JA conjugates ruled out competition from other conjugation reactions. • RCA-silenced plants accumulated more methyl jasmonate (MeJA) after OS elicitation, which corresponded to increased jasmonate methyltransferase (JMT) activity. RCA silencing phenocopies JMT overexpression, wherein elevated JMT activity redirects OS-elicited JA flux towards inactive MeJA, creating a JA sink which depletes JA-Ile and its associated defense responses. • Hence, RCA plays an additional non-photosynthetic role in attenuating JA-mediated defenses and their associated costs, potentially allowing plants to anticipate resource-based constraints on growth before they actually occur.",f9533e77c04d135e6bc72fc64a2655bba631bff4,,0

https://doi.org/10.1002/ECS2.1218,Herbivore density mediates the indirect effect of herbivores on plants via induced resistance and apparent competition,"Herbivore-induced plant resistance and apparent competition are two indirect ways herbivores interact. If a less damaging herbivore indirectly suppresses the abundance of a more damaging herbivore via these mechanisms, then plants may ultimately benefit. Changes in herbivore density, however, can dictate the intensity of species interactions and may play a critical role in determining the outcome of plant- and predator-mediated herbivore interactions. We tested the effects of herbivore density on the strength of indirect interactions among phloem-feeding aphids and herbivorous caterpillars and the outcome of these interactions for their shared host plant, cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). We quantified the survival of caterpillars on host plants that were infested with varying densities of aphids in the presence and absence of predators (ladybeetles). We found that aphids induced defensive proteins in cotton plants and that caterpillar survival was negatively affected by induced resistance. Likewise, we found that the presence of aphids increased predation of caterpillars by ladybeetles, but that apparent competition between aphids and caterpillars was density dependent. Ladybeetles consumed relatively high numbers of small caterpillars at low to intermediate aphid densities, but essentially became aphid specialists at high aphid densities. Aphid induced defenses and apparent competition combined such that plant damage by caterpillars was lowest when predators were present at low aphid density (induced resistance + highest level of apparent competition). This suggests that herbivores can benefit plants, but the effect on host plants is mediated by herbivore density. Indirect herbivore-plant mutualisms may increase plant quality, plant fitness, and yield of crop plants and these interactions need to be considered in ecologically based pest management plans. In addition, these interactions likely alter arthropod community structure and natural selection on anti-herbivore defense traits in plants in natural systems.",fc5312776738c6a1c139b9e0a5aedcdb7cd8f412,,0

Respond to Fencing and Water-Nitrogen Addition
in Horqin Grassland, China","Plant functional traits can reflect the response and adaptation of plant species to environmental changes. However, how plant functional traits of dominant species respond to the fencing, water and nitrogen additions in a sandy grassland ecosystem is still unclear. Here, a manipulative field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of fencing, water and nitrogen addition on the functional traits of four dominant species (Pennisetum centrasiaticum, Cleistogenes squarrosa, Chenopodium acuminatum and Salsola collina) in Horqin sandy grassland. The results showed that nitrogen addition had a significant effect on plant height, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen content (LNC), and leaf dry matter content (LDMC). Nitrogen addition increased plant height for C. squarrosa as well as SLA for P. centrasiaticum and S. collina, while reducing plant height for P. centrasiaticum and LDMC for S. collina. Also, nitrogen addition increased LNC for the four dominant species. Water addition reduced LDMC in grazing treatment, as well as plant height in fencing and nitrogen addition treatments. Compared to control treatment, nitrogen addition increased the strength of negative associations of LDMC with plant height and LNC. The results suggest that nitrogen addition plays an important role in determining the growth of the four dominant species, and water addition increases the competition of resource use among species in fencing and nitrogen addition treatments. Plants in sandy grassland can mediate the key functional traits to cope with alterations of water and nitrogen under the future global change scenarios.",fe3629c3e75312e47055d24c51ce515f694d54f2,,0
https://doi.org/10.3390/biology12050741,Generation of Herbicide-Resistant Soybean by Base Editing,"Simple Summary Soybean is a prominent grain and oil crop in the world. The production of soybean is threatened by weed competition. Recently, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated base editing, which can cause irreversible nucleotide changes in target loci, has been widely used in basic plant science and breeding. However, until now, herbicide-resistant traits in soybean have not been created by the base editor. The objective of this study was to modify different AHAS homologous alleles by base editor to generate a novel AHAS-inhibiting herbicide-resistant soybean. Our results showed that the GmAHAS4 P180S mutants have apparent resistance to AHAS-inhibiting herbicides, which will be beneficial for weed control in soybean production. Abstract Weeds cause the largest yield loss in soybean production. The development of herbicide-resistant soybean germplasm is of great significance for weed control and yield improvement. In this study, we used the cytosine base editor (BE3) to develop novel herbicide-resistant soybean. We have successfully introduced base substitutions in GmAHAS3 and GmAHAS4 and obtained a heritable transgene-free soybean with homozygous P180S mutation in GmAHAS4. The GmAHAS4 P180S mutants have apparent resistance to chlorsulfuron, flucarbazone-sodium, and flumetsulam. In particular, the resistance to chlorsulfuron was more than 100 times that of with wild type TL-1. The agronomic performance of the GmAHAS4 P180S mutants showed no significant differences to TL-1 under natural growth conditions. In addition, we developed allele-specific PCR markers for the GmAHAS4 P180S mutants, which can easily discriminate homozygous, heterozygous mutants, and wild-type plants. This study demonstrates a feasible and effective way to generate herbicide-resistant soybean by using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated base editing.",ff29c1f5e428404258554d4b3c89431b899885dc,,0
