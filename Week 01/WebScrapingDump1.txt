{"The contribution of trait-mediated indirect effects to the net effects of a predator": {"Title": "The contribution of trait-mediated indirect effects to the net effects of a predator", "Abstract": "Many prey modify traits in response to predation risk and this modification of traits can influence the prey's resource acquisition rate. A predator thus can have a \u201cnonlethal\u201d impact on prey that can lead to indirect effects on other community members. Such indirect interactions are termed trait-mediated indirect interactions because they arise from a predator's influence on prey traits, rather than prey density. Because such nonlethal predator effects are immediate, can influence the entire prey population, and can occur over the entire prey lifetime, we argue that nonlethal predator effects are likely to contribute strongly to the net indirect effects of predators (i.e., nonlethal effects may be comparable in magnitude to those resulting from killing prey). This prediction was supported by an experiment in which the indirect effects of a larval dragonfly (Anax sp.) predator on large bullfrog tadpoles (Rana catesbeiana), through nonlethal effects on competing small bullfrog tadpoles, were large relative to indirect effects caused by density reduction of the small tadpoles (the lethal effect). Treatments in which lethal and nonlethal effects of Anax were manipulated independently indicated that this result was robust for a large range of different combinations of lethal and nonlethal effects. Because many, if not most, prey modify traits in response to predators, our results suggest that the magnitude of interaction coefficients between two species may often be dynamically related to changes in other community members, and that many indirect effects previously attributed to the lethal effects of predators may instead be due to shifts in traits of surviving prey.", "Links": "[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.071061998\", \"https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc31151?pdf=render\", \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/449ff563c53abf3bfc9da2eacc41ad15f277536e?utm_source=consensus\"]", "Citations": "[\"The primacy of density\\u2010mediated indirect effects in a community of wolves, elk, and aspen\", \"Size\\u2010specific reduction in kelp consumption by New Zealand urchins exposed to chemical cues from the red rock lobster\", \"Chimeric states induced by higher-order interactions in coupled prey-predator systems.\", \"Fish microbiota repel ovipositing mosquitoes.\", \"Housework or vigilance?

Few studies, however, have addressed how relative susceptibility to predation influences such interactions. Here we examine the effect of chemical cues from the common shore crab Carcinus maenas on the foraging behavior of two common intertidal gastropod molluscs. Of the two model consumers studied, Littorina littorea is morphologically more vulnerable to crab predation than Gibbula umbilicalis, and it exhibited greater competitive ability in the absence of predation threat. However, Littorina demonstrated a greater anti-predator response when experimentally exposed to predation cues, resulting in a lower level of foraging. This reversed the competitive interaction, allowing Gibbula substantially increased access to shared resources. Our results demonstrate that the susceptibility of consumers to predation can influence species interactions, and suggest that inter-specific differences in trait-mediated indirect interactions are another mechanism through which non-consumptive predator effects may influence trophic interactions.", "Links": "[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0023068\", \"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0023068&type=printable\", \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0495fd8729d0e138036bb6fdbf237592d014fcb7?utm_source=consensus\"]", "Citations": "[\"Effects of local anthropogenic stressors on a habitat cascade in an estuarine seagrass system\", \"Effects of Predator Avoidance Behavior on the Coexistence of Competing Prey\", \"Olfactory navigation in aquatic gastropods\", \"Intermediate predator na\\u00efvet\\u00e9 and sex-skewed vulnerability predict the impact of an invasive higher predator\", \"The Braveheart amphipod: a review of responses of invasive Dikerogammarus villosus to predation signals\", \"Predation and Competition Differentially Affect the Interactions and Trophic Niches of a Neotropical Amphibian Guild\", \"Combined effects of predation risk and food quality on freshwater detritivore insects\", \"Differential Responses of Two Ecologically Similar Case-Bearing Caddisfly Species to a Fish Chemical Cue: Implications for a Coexistence Mechanism\", \"Effects of predation risk and temperature on foraging behaviour of Littorina littorea\", \"Fiddler crab spatial distributions are influenced by physiological stressors independent of sympatric interactions\"]", "References": "[\"Effects of local anthropogenic stressors on a habitat cascade in an estuarine seagrass system\", \"Effects of Predator Avoidance Behavior on the Coexistence of Competing Prey\", \"Olfactory navigation in aquatic gastropods\", \"Intermediate predator na\\u00efvet\\u00e9 and sex-skewed vulnerability predict the impact of an invasive higher predator\", \"The Braveheart amphipod: a review of responses of invasive Dikerogammarus villosus to predation signals\", \"Predation and Competition Differentially Affect the Interactions and Trophic Niches of a Neotropical Amphibian Guild\", \"Combined effects of predation risk and food quality on freshwater detritivore insects\", \"Differential Responses of Two Ecologically Similar Case-Bearing Caddisfly Species to a Fish Chemical Cue: Implications for a Coexistence Mechanism\", \"Effects of predation risk and temperature on foraging behaviour of Littorina littorea\", \"Fiddler crab spatial distributions are influenced by physiological stressors independent of sympatric interactions\"]"}, "Predator and prey functional traits: understanding the adaptive machinery driving predator\u2013prey interactions": {"Title": "Predator and prey functional traits: understanding the adaptive machinery driving predator\u2013prey interactions", "Abstract": "Predator\u2013prey relationships are a central component of community dynamics. Classic approaches have tried to understand and predict these relationships in terms of consumptive interactions between predator and prey species, but characterizing the interaction this way is insufficient to predict the complexity and context dependency inherent in predator\u2013prey relationships. Recent approaches have begun to explore predator\u2013prey relationships in terms of an evolutionary-ecological game in which predator and prey adapt to each other through reciprocal interactions involving context-dependent expression of functional traits that influence their biomechanics. Functional traits are defined as any morphological, behavioral, or physiological trait of an organism associated with a biotic interaction. Such traits include predator and prey body size, predator and prey personality, predator hunting mode, prey mobility, prey anti-predator behavior, and prey physiological stress. Here, I discuss recent advances in this functional trait approach. Evidence shows that the nature and strength of many interactions are dependent upon the relative magnitude of predator and prey functional traits. Moreover, trait responses can be triggered by non-consumptive predator\u2013prey interactions elicited by responses of prey to risk of predation. These interactions in turn can have dynamic feedbacks that can change the context of the predator\u2013prey interaction, causing predator and prey to adapt their traits\u2014through phenotypically plastic or rapid evolutionary responses\u2014and the nature of their interaction. Research shows that examining predator\u2013prey interactions through the lens of an adaptive evolutionary-ecological game offers a foundation to explain variety in the nature and strength of predator\u2013prey interactions observed in different ecological contexts.", "Links": "[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.11813.1\", \"https://f1000research.com/articles/6-1767/v1/pdf\", \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a979718758f6c877a5401c2689edc072b13591f7?utm_source=consensus\"]", "Citations": "[\"An empirical predator\\u2012prey model: Examining the interaction of Florida panthers, white\\u2010tailed deer, and cattle in Florida\", \"Dietary habits of fishing cats in a human-dominated wetland in Coastal Thailand\", \"Does size matter?

Current food web theory considers interactions between numerous species simultaneously, but descriptive models are unable to predict interactions between newly co-occurring species. Incorporating proxies such as functional traits and phylogeny into models could help infer predator/ prey interactions. \nHere we used trait-matching between predator feeding traits and prey vulnerability traits, along with phylogeny (used as a proxy for chemical defence and other traits difficult to document), to infer predatory interactions using ground beetles as model organisms. \nA feeding experiment was conducted involving 20 ground beetle and 115 prey species to determine which pair of species did or did not interact. Eight predator and four prey functional traits were measured directly on specimens. Then, using a modeling approach based on the matching-centrality formalism, we evaluated 511 predictive ecological models that tested different combinations of all predator and prey functional traits, and phylogenetic information. \nThe most parsimonious model accurately predicted 81 % of the observed realized and unrealized interactions, using phylogenetic information and the trait-matches predator biting force/ prey cuticular toughness and predator/ prey body size ratio. The best trait-based models predicted correctly >80 % which species interact (realized interactions), but predict 75 %. \nThe matching of predator biting force and prey cuticular toughness demonstrated a better predictive power than the commonly used predator/ prey body size ratio. Our novel model combining both functional traits and phylogeny extends beyond existing descriptive approaches and could represent a valuable tool to predict consumer/ resource interactions of newly introduced species and to resolve cryptic food webs. \n \n \nThis article is protected by copyright.

In contrast, nearly all individuals experience the chronic effects of predation risk. When threatened by predators, prey adopt defensive tactics whose costs can lead to reduced growth, maturation rates, survivorship, fecundity, or pop- ulation density. This nonconsumptive impact of predation risk on prey is known as a ''trait- mediated interaction'' (TMI) because it results from changes in prey traits such as behavior or physiology. Ecological theory suggests that the strength of TMI effects will reflect a balance between the conflicting demands of reproduction vs. predator avoidance. Competitor density and resource availability are expected to alter the balance between these conflicting forces. We conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured TMI effect size while varying competitor and/or resource density. The threat of predation had an overall negative effect on prey performance, but the strength of this effect varied with the level of competition. High competition exacerbated the negative effect of intimidation on prey density but moderated the negative effect of intimidation on prey life history and growth. We discuss these results in light of previously published theoretical expectations.

In field and laboratory experiments, we manipulated the presence or absence of P. melanarius and aphids and recorded the impact of these manipulations on beetle activity and fly egg predation. Individually, aphids, by serving as preferred prey, and P. melanarius, by reducing focal beetle activity, weakened egg predation. However, egg predation was restored when both aphids and P. melanarius were present together, because aphids triggered greater foraging activity, and thus increased incidental predation of fly eggs, by P. melanarius. Thus, TMII among subsets of the community that were disruptive to predation on fly eggs could not be summed to predict the dominant, positive TMII within a more diverse community.

We conducted the experiments in cattle watering tanks in order to establish whether competitive and predator-prey interactions between two species are affected by other species in the system; i.e., are pairwise interaction strengths affected by the background species assemblage? We examined the survival and growth response of small bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and small green frog (Rana clamitans) tadpoles in the presence and absence of a competitor (large bullfrogs), the lethal presence of the larval odonate predator Tramea lacerata,and the nonlethal (caged) presence of the larval odonate predators Anax junius and Anax longipes. We demonstrate that large bullfrog competitors and caged Anax affect traits (foraging activity level) of small bullfrog and small green frog tadpoles and that these changes in traits, in turn, affect interactions of the small tadpole species with each other and with the other species. In particular, the following four trait- mediated indirect interactions were evident: (1) Presence of large bullfrog competitors increased the predation rate of Trameaon small green frogs and small bullfrogs. (2) Presence of nonlethal Anax reduced the predation rate of Tramea on small green frogs. (3) Presence of nonlethal Anax increased the competitive advantage of bullfrogs over green frogs. (4) Presence of nonlethal Anax facilitated midge invasion of the experimental units. The pro- posed mechanisms (changes in small tadpole activity) involved in these trait-mediated indirect interactions were supported by observational data on tadpole activity and resource levels in the experimental units, and in laboratory experiments examining tadpole activity responses to predators.
