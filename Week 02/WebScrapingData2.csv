The contribution of trait-mediated indirect effects to the net effects of a predator,"Many prey modify traits in response to predation risk and this modification of traits can influence the prey's resource acquisition rate. A predator thus can have a “nonlethal” impact on prey that can lead to indirect effects on other community members. Such indirect interactions are termed trait-mediated indirect interactions because they arise from a predator's influence on prey traits, rather than prey density. Because such nonlethal predator effects are immediate, can influence the entire prey population, and can occur over the entire prey lifetime, we argue that nonlethal predator effects are likely to contribute strongly to the net indirect effects of predators (i.e., nonlethal effects may be comparable in magnitude to those resulting from killing prey). This prediction was supported by an experiment in which the indirect effects of a larval dragonfly (Anax sp.) predator on large bullfrog tadpoles (Rana catesbeiana), through nonlethal effects on competing small bullfrog tadpoles, were large relative to indirect effects caused by density reduction of the small tadpoles (the lethal effect). Treatments in which lethal and nonlethal effects of Anax were manipulated independently indicated that this result was robust for a large range of different combinations of lethal and nonlethal effects. Because many, if not most, prey modify traits in response to predators, our results suggest that the magnitude of interaction coefficients between two species may often be dynamically related to changes in other community members, and that many indirect effects previously attributed to the lethal effects of predators may instead be due to shifts in traits of surviving prey.","[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.071061998"", ""https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc31151?pdf=render"", ""https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/449ff563c53abf3bfc9da2eacc41ad15f277536e?utm_source=consensus""]","[""The primacy of density\u2010mediated indirect effects in a community of wolves, elk, and aspen"", ""Size\u2010specific reduction in kelp consumption by New Zealand urchins exposed to chemical cues from the red rock lobster"", ""Chimeric states induced by higher-order interactions in coupled prey-predator systems."", ""Fish microbiota repel ovipositing mosquitoes."", ""Housework or vigilance?

Predator and prey functional traits: understanding the adaptive machinery driving predator–prey interactions,"Predator–prey relationships are a central component of community dynamics. Classic approaches have tried to understand and predict these relationships in terms of consumptive interactions between predator and prey species, but characterizing the interaction this way is insufficient to predict the complexity and context dependency inherent in predator–prey relationships. Recent approaches have begun to explore predator–prey relationships in terms of an evolutionary-ecological game in which predator and prey adapt to each other through reciprocal interactions involving context-dependent expression of functional traits that influence their biomechanics. Functional traits are defined as any morphological, behavioral, or physiological trait of an organism associated with a biotic interaction. Such traits include predator and prey body size, predator and prey personality, predator hunting mode, prey mobility, prey anti-predator behavior, and prey physiological stress. Here, I discuss recent advances in this functional trait approach. Evidence shows that the nature and strength of many interactions are dependent upon the relative magnitude of predator and prey functional traits. Moreover, trait responses can be triggered by non-consumptive predator–prey interactions elicited by responses of prey to risk of predation. These interactions in turn can have dynamic feedbacks that can change the context of the predator–prey interaction, causing predator and prey to adapt their traits—through phenotypically plastic or rapid evolutionary responses—and the nature of their interaction. Research shows that examining predator–prey interactions through the lens of an adaptive evolutionary-ecological game offers a foundation to explain variety in the nature and strength of predator–prey interactions observed in different ecological contexts.","[""http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.11813.1"", ""https://f1000research.com/articles/6-1767/v1/pdf"", ""https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a979718758f6c877a5401c2689edc072b13591f7?utm_source=consensus""]","[""An empirical predator\u2012prey model: Examining the interaction of Florida panthers, white\u2010tailed deer, and cattle in Florida"", ""Dietary habits of fishing cats in a human-dominated wetland in Coastal Thailand"", ""Does size matter?

Trait matching and phylogeny as predictors of predator–prey interactions involving ground beetles,"Summary 
With global change modifying species assemblages, our success in predicting ecosystem level consequences of these new communities will depend, in part, on our ability to understand biotic interactions. Current food web theory considers interactions between numerous species simultaneously, but descriptive models are unable to predict interactions between newly co-occurring species. Incorporating proxies such as functional traits and phylogeny into models could help infer predator/ prey interactions. 
Here we used trait-matching between predator feeding traits and prey vulnerability traits, along with phylogeny (used as a proxy for chemical defence and other traits difficult to document), to infer predatory interactions using ground beetles as model organisms. 
A feeding experiment was conducted involving 20 ground beetle and 115 prey species to determine which pair of species did or did not interact. Eight predator and four prey functional traits were measured directly on specimens. Then, using a modeling approach based on the matching-centrality formalism, we evaluated 511 predictive ecological models that tested different combinations of all predator and prey functional traits, and phylogenetic information. 
The most parsimonious model accurately predicted 81 % of the observed realized and unrealized interactions, using phylogenetic information and the trait-matches predator biting force/ prey cuticular toughness and predator/ prey body size ratio. The best trait-based models predicted correctly >80 % which species interact (realized interactions), but predict 75 %. 
The matching of predator biting force and prey cuticular toughness demonstrated a better predictive power than the commonly used predator/ prey body size ratio. Our novel model combining both functional traits and phylogeny extends beyond existing descriptive approaches and could represent a valuable tool to predict consumer/ resource interactions of newly introduced species and to resolve cryptic food webs.

RESOURCE COMPETITION MODIFIES THE STRENGTH OF TRAIT- MEDIATED PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS: A META-ANALYSIS,"Only a fraction of the individuals in a given prey population are likely to be killed and consumed by predators. In contrast, nearly all individuals experience the chronic effects of predation risk. When threatened by predators, prey adopt defensive tactics whose costs can lead to reduced growth, maturation rates, survivorship, fecundity, or pop- ulation density. This nonconsumptive impact of predation risk on prey is known as a ''trait- mediated interaction'' (TMI) because it results from changes in prey traits such as behavior or physiology. Ecological theory suggests that the strength of TMI effects will reflect a balance between the conflicting demands of reproduction vs. predator avoidance. Competitor density and resource availability are expected to alter the balance between these conflicting forces. We conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured TMI effect size while varying competitor and/or resource density. The threat of predation had an overall negative effect on prey performance, but the strength of this effect varied with the level of competition. High competition exacerbated the negative effect of intimidation on prey density but moderated the negative effect of intimidation on prey life history and growth. We discuss these results in light of previously published theoretical expectations. Our results highlight the variable and context-dependent nature of interspecific interactions.","[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/04-1249"", ""https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/970ddf8e9cc5c6ee0795cbf90ff98aec7e533baa?utm_source=consensus""]","[""Sustained predation pressure may prevent the loss of anti\u2010predator traits from havened populations"", ""Disentangling genetic, plastic and social learning drivers of sex-specific foraging behaviour in Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata)"", ""Top-Down Effect of Arthropod Predator Chinese Mitten Crab on Freshwater Nutrient Cycling"", ""A Review of the Giant Triton (Charonia tritonis), from Exploitation to Coral Reef Protector?"", ""Development and Interrogation of a Transcriptomic Resource for the Giant Triton Snail (Charonia tritonis)"", ""Response of Tropical African Macroinvertebrates with Varying Tolerances to Different Levels of Nitrate and Phosphate"", ""The context dependence of non-consumptive predator effects."", ""Non-consumptive effects in fish predator\u2013prey interactions on coral reefs"", ""Larval newts adjust foraging rate to perceived predator and competitor proximity"", ""The effect of conspecific cues on honey bee foraging behavior"", ""Effects of the exotic rotifer Kellicottia bostoniensis (Rousselet, 1908) on the microbial food web components"", ""Little to fear: largest lizard predator induces weak defense responses in ungulate prey""]","[""SCARED TO DEATH?

"Diverse trait-mediated interactions in a multi-predator, multi-prey community.","Trait-mediated interactions (TMII) can alter the outcome or magnitude of species interactions. We examined how the interaction between a guild of ground and rove beetles and their fly egg prey was altered by a larger predator, the ground beetle Pterostichus melanarius, and an additional prey, aphids. In field and laboratory experiments, we manipulated the presence or absence of P. melanarius and aphids and recorded the impact of these manipulations on beetle activity and fly egg predation. Individually, aphids, by serving as preferred prey, and P. melanarius, by reducing focal beetle activity, weakened egg predation. However, egg predation was restored when both aphids and P. melanarius were present together, because aphids triggered greater foraging activity, and thus increased incidental predation of fly eggs, by P. melanarius. Thus, TMII among subsets of the community that were disruptive to predation on fly eggs could not be summed to predict the dominant, positive TMII within a more diverse community. Future TMII studies should include more realistic representations of species diversity, and should not ignore the influence of prey on predator behavior.","[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1131:DTIIAM]2.0.CO;2"", ""https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b658df0f59d96c1cc3a48e10ea9e5e1d465816b2?utm_source=consensus""]","[""Invasive predator disrupts link between predator evenness and herbivore suppression"", ""Non-consumptive effects between predators depend on the foraging mode of intraguild prey."", ""Consumptive and non-consumptive effects of predatory arthropods on billbug (Coleoptera: Dryophthoridae) pests in turfgrass"", ""Utilizing Low\u2010Cost Eggshell Particles to Enhance the Mechanical Response of Mg\u20132.5Zn Magnesium Alloy Matrix"", ""Predation and Competition Differentially Affect the Interactions and Trophic Niches of a Neotropical Amphibian Guild"", ""Understanding plant\u2013arthropod interactions in multitrophic communities to improve conservation biological control: useful traits and metrics"", ""Are wolves just wasps with teeth?

TRAIT-MEDIATED INDIRECT INTERACTIONS IN A SIMPLE AQUATIC FOOD WEB,"This investigation examines the role of trait-mediated indirect interactions in a simple aquatic food web. We conducted the experiments in cattle watering tanks in order to establish whether competitive and predator-prey interactions between two species are affected by other species in the system; i.e., are pairwise interaction strengths affected by the background species assemblage? We examined the survival and growth response of small bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and small green frog (Rana clamitans) tadpoles in the presence and absence of a competitor (large bullfrogs), the lethal presence of the larval odonate predator Tramea lacerata,and the nonlethal (caged) presence of the larval odonate predators Anax junius and Anax longipes. We demonstrate that large bullfrog competitors and caged Anax affect traits (foraging activity level) of small bullfrog and small green frog tadpoles and that these changes in traits, in turn, affect interactions of the small tadpole species with each other and with the other species. In particular, the following four trait- mediated indirect interactions were evident: (1) Presence of large bullfrog competitors increased the predation rate of Trameaon small green frogs and small bullfrogs. (2) Presence of nonlethal Anax reduced the predation rate of Tramea on small green frogs. (3) Presence of nonlethal Anax increased the competitive advantage of bullfrogs over green frogs. (4) Presence of nonlethal Anax facilitated midge invasion of the experimental units. The pro- posed mechanisms (changes in small tadpole activity) involved in these trait-mediated indirect interactions were supported by observational data on tadpole activity and resource levels in the experimental units, and in laboratory experiments examining tadpole activity responses to predators. The occurrence of strong trait-mediated indirect interactions in this simple food web underscores the potential importance of such interactions in animal com- munities.","[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[1146:TMIIIA]2.0.CO;2"", ""https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/41f8934b99b3665ae5d3dddedd767e861077ca2a?utm_source=consensus""]","[""Salinisation and warming disrupt predator-induced drift behaviour in aquatic predator-prey interactions"", ""Trophic cascades within and across ecosystems: The role of anti-predatory defences, predator type and detritus quality."", ""Predator-prey systems as models for integrative research in biology: the value of a non-consumptive effects framework."", ""Fear and loathing in the pelagic: How the seascape of fear impacts the biological carbon pump"", ""Predators override rainfall effects on tropical food webs"", ""Direct effects influence larval salamander size and density more than indirect effects"", ""A framework and standardized terminology to facilitate the study of predation-risk effects."", ""Non-consumptive predator effects on prey population size: a dearth of evidence."", ""The threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as a modifier of ecological disturbances"", ""Do community and food-web metrics temporally change in tropical systems?

CONNECTING THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL STUDIES OF TRAIT‐MEDIATED INTERACTIONS,"Trait-mediated interactions (TMIs), in which trophic and competitive inter- actions depend on individual traits as well as on overall population densities, have inspired large amounts of research, but theoretical and empirical studies have not been well con- nected. To help mitigate this problem, we review and synthesize the theoretical literature on TMIs and, in particular, on trait-mediated indirect interactions, TMIIs, in which the presence of one species mediates the interaction between a second and third species. (1) In models, TMIs tend to stabilize simple communities; adding further biological detail often reduces stability in models, but populations may persist even if their dynamics become mathematically unstable. (2) Short- and long-term changes in population density caused by TMIs depend even more on details, such as the curvature of functional responses and trade-offs, which have rarely been measured. (3) The effects of TMIs in multipredator communities depend in a straightforward way on the specificity of prey defenses. (4) Tritrophic and more complex communities are theoretically difficult; few general conclu- sions have emerged. Theory needs new kinds of experiments as a guide. The most critical needs are experiments that measure curvatures of trade-offs and responses, and experiments that (combined with theory) allow us to scale from short- to long-term responses of com- munities.

How Do Trait-Mediated Non-lethal Effects of Predation Affect Population-Level Performance of Mosquitoes?,"Non-lethal, trait-mediated effects of predation impact prey behavior and life-history traits. Studying how these effects in turn influence prey demography is crucial to understand prey life-history evolution. Mosquitoes are important vectors that claim several million lives every year worldwide by transmitting a range of pathogens. Several ecological factors affect life-history traits of both larval and adult mosquitoes, creating effects that cascade to population-level consequences. Few studies have comprehensively explored the non-lethal effects of predation and its interactions with resources and competition on larval, adult, and population traits of mosquitoes. Understanding these interactions is important because the effects of predation are hypothesized to rescue prey populations from the effects of density-dependence resulting from larval competition. Aedes aegypti larvae reared at two different larval densities and subjected to three non-lethal predator treatments were monitored for survival, development time, and adult size through the larval stages to adult eclosion, and adult females were monitored for survival and reproduction through their first gonotrophic cycle. Intraspecific competition increased larval development time, yielded small-bodied adults, and reduced fecundity in individuals exposed to predatory chemical cues as larvae. Exposure to cues from a living predator affected both body size and latency to blood feed in females. Analysis of life-table traits revealed significant effects of competition on net reproductive rate (R 0) of mosquitoes. The interaction between competition and predator treatments significantly affected the cohort rate of increase (r) and the index of performance (r'). The index of performance, which estimates rate of population change based on the size-fecundity relationship, was significantly and positively correlated with r, but overestimated r slightly. Lack of significant effect of predator treatments and larval density on cohort generation time (T c) further suggests that the observed effects of treatments on r and r' were largely a consequence of the effects on R 0. Also, the significant effects of treatment combinations on larval development time, adult body size and fecundity were ultimately manifested as effects on life-table traits estimated from adult survival and reproduction.","[""http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2019.00025"", ""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2019.00025/pdf"", ""https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/844cc6e943ca79d1de1083521c0e7ec25d1e1eed?utm_source=consensus""]","[""Competition is the main factor, compared to non-lethal threat of predation, affecting life-history traits of Aedes aegypti (Diptera, Culicidae) mosquitoes."", ""Context-specific variation in life history traits and behavior of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes"", ""Trait- and density-mediated effects of predation on fecundity and fertility of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes"", ""Different demographic responses of three species of container Aedes (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae to timing of extrinsic mortality"", ""The size of larval rearing container modulates the effects of diet amount and larval density on larval development in Aedes aegypti"", ""Survival-Larval Density Relationships in the Field and Their Implications for Control of Container-Dwelling Aedes Mosquitoes"", ""Nonlethal effects of predation: Presence of insectivorous birds affects the behaviour and level of stress in insects"", ""Juvenile hormone analog enhances Zika virus infection in Aedes aegypti"", ""Modeling the effects of Aedes aegypti\u2019s larval environment on adult body mass at emergence"", ""Differences in the intestinal microbiota between insecticide\u2010resistant and \u2010sensitive Aedes albopictus based on full\u2010length 16S rRNA sequencing"", ""Aquatic Exposure to Abscisic Acid Transstadially Enhances Anopheles stephensi Resistance to Malaria Parasite Infection"", ""Toxorhynchites Species: A Review of Current Knowledge"", ""Assessment of the ecologically dependent post-zygotic isolation between Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles gambiae"", ""Simulated climate change, but not predation risk, accelerates Aedes aegypti emergence in a microcosm experiment in western Amazonia""]","[""Competition is the main factor, compared to non-lethal threat of predation, affecting life-history traits of Aedes aegypti (Diptera, Culicidae) mosquitoes."", ""Context-specific variation in life history traits and behavior of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes"", ""Trait- and density-mediated effects of predation on fecundity and fertility of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes"", ""Different demographic responses of three species of container Aedes (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae to timing of extrinsic mortality"", ""The size of larval rearing container modulates the effects of diet amount and larval density on larval development in Aedes aegypti"", ""Survival-Larval Density Relationships in the Field and Their Implications for Control of Container-Dwelling Aedes Mosquitoes"", ""Nonlethal effects of predation: Presence of insectivorous birds affects the behaviour and level of stress in insects"", ""Juvenile hormone analog enhances Zika virus infection in Aedes aegypti"", ""Modeling the effects of Aedes aegypti\u2019s larval environment on adult body mass at emergence"", ""Differences in the intestinal microbiota between insecticide\u2010resistant and \u2010sensitive Aedes albopictus based on full\u2010length 16S rRNA sequencing"", ""Aquatic Exposure to Abscisic Acid Transstadially Enhances Anopheles stephensi Resistance to Malaria Parasite Infection"", ""Toxorhynchites Species: A Review of Current Knowledge"", ""Assessment of the ecologically dependent post-zygotic isolation between Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles gambiae"", ""Simulated climate change, but not predation risk, accelerates Aedes aegypti emergence in a microcosm experiment in western Amazonia""]"
Evolutionary ecology of inducible morphological plasticity in predator–prey interaction: toward the practical links with population ecology,"The outcome of species interactions is often strongly influenced by variation in the functional traits of the individuals participating. A rather large body of work demonstrates that inducible morphological plasticity in predators and prey can both influence and be influenced by species interaction strength, with important consequences for individual fitness. Much of the past research in this area has focused on the ecological and evolutionary significance of trait plasticity by studying single predator–prey pairs and testing the performance of individuals having induced and noninduced phenotypes. This research has thus been critical in improving our understanding of the adaptive value of trait plasticity and its widespread occurrence across species and community types. More recently, researchers have expanded this foundation by examining how the complexity of organismal design and community-level properties can shape plasticity in functional traits. In addition, researchers have begun to merge evolutionary and ecological perspectives by linking trait plasticity to community dynamics, with particular attention on trait-mediated indirect interactions. Here, we review recent studies on inducible morphological plasticity in predators and their prey with an emphasis on internal and external constraints and how the nature of predator–prey interactions influences the expression of inducible phenotypes. In particular, we focus on multiple-trait plasticity, flexibility and modification of inducible plasticity, and reciprocal plasticity between predator and prey. Based on our arguments on these issues, we propose future research directions that should better integrate evolutionary and population studies and thus improve our understanding of the role of phenotypic plasticity in predator–prey population and community dynamics.","[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10144-009-0182-0"", ""https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fe0d6ec134c1e7362f53e5236ea3914c865d48c4?utm_source=consensus""]","[""Metabolic scaling of an invasive mussel depends on temperature and chemical cues from an invasive predator"", ""Predator\u2010induced shape plasticity in Daphnia pulex"", ""Intraspecific Shape Analysis of Bali Sardinella (Sardinella lemuru) Using Geometric Morphometrics Collected in the Coast of Cabadbaran, Agusan Del Norte, Philippines"", ""Keep the ball rolling: sexual differences in conglobation behavior of a terrestrial isopod under different degrees of perceived predation pressure"", ""Allometry of Defense: Predator Shift Alters Ontogenetic Growth Patterns in an Antipredator Trait"", ""Novel predator-induced phenotypic plasticity by hemoglobin and physiological changes in the brain of Xenopus tropicalis"", ""Proteomic changes associated with predator\u2010induced morphological defences in oysters"", ""Adaptive plasticity in activity modes and food web stability"", ""Similar Response of a Range Expanding Dragonfly to Low- and High-Elevation Predators"", ""Why study plasticity in multiple traits?

Trait and density mediated indirect interactions in simple food webs,"This article compares indirect trait-mediated interactions in simple resource-consumer-predator food webs with those that are density-mediated. It focuses on two well documented responses of consumers to predation risk: decrease in consumer activity and habitat switch. These behavioral effects are transmitted to resources and they cause similar indirect effects as those which are mediated by density changes in consumers. Two indirect interactions are studied in this article: trophic cascades, and apparent competition. Results for density only, trait only and combined density and trait mediated interactions are compared and discussed with respect to manipulation with predator density (top-down manipulation) and resource environmental capacity (bottom-up manipulation). The article shows that trait-mediated, effects on species equilibrial densities are similar to those of density-mediated, but they are often highly non-linear. Thus, they may have potential for even stronger impact on food webs than those which are density mediated.","[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/J.0030-1299.2004.12695.X"", ""https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a242ffefff4e1430ad413b48da6fac5f849b36c5?utm_source=consensus""]","[""The role of fish predators and their foraging traits in shaping zooplankton community structure."", ""Influence of predator density in foraging behavior and microhabitat choice on litter-dwelling scorpions"", ""Fear and loathing in the pelagic: How the seascape of fear impacts the biological carbon pump"", ""Functional Responses and Additive Multiple Predator Effects of Two Common Wetland Fish"", ""Population modelling insights of extinct environments: the case of the Kem Kem palaeocommunity"", ""Prey adaptation along a competition-defense tradeoff cryptically shifts trophic cascades from density- to trait-mediated"", ""Plant coexistence mediated by adaptive foraging preferences of exploiters or mutualists."", ""The threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as a modifier of ecological disturbances"", ""Plant structural complexity mediates trade-off in direct and indirect plant defense by birds."", ""Effects of Predator Avoidance Behavior on the Coexistence of Competing Prey""]","[""Adaptive foraging and flexible food web topology"", ""Alternative Food, Switching Predators, and the Persistence of Predator\u2010Prey Systems"", ""The contribution of trait-mediated indirect effects to the net effects of a predator"", ""PREDATOR EFFECTS ON AN ASSEMBLAGE OF CONSUMERS THROUGH INDUCED CHANGES IN CONSUMER FORAGING BEHAVIOR"", ""Why Are Parts of the World Green?
