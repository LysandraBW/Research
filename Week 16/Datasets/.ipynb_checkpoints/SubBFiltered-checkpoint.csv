1226,Opposing macroevolutionary and trait‐mediated patterns of threat and naturalisation in flowering plants,"Abstract Due to expanding global trade and movement of people, new plant species are establishing in exotic ranges at increasing rates while the number of native species facing extinction from multiple threats grows. Yet, how species losses and gains globally may, together, be linked to traits and macroevolutionary processes is poorly understood. Here, we show that, adjusting for diversification rate and clade age, the proportion of threatened species across flowering plant families is negatively related to the proportion of naturalised species per family. Moreover, naturalisation is positively associated with range size, short generation time, autonomous seed production and interspecific hybridisation, but negatively with age and diversification, whereas threat is negatively associated with range size and hybridisation, and positively with biotic pollination, age and diversification rate. That we find such a pronounced signature of naturalisation and threat across plant families suggests that both trait syndromes have coexisted over deep evolutionary time and counter to intuition, that neither strategy is necessarily superior to the other over long evolutionary timespans.",https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13740,0
1216,Trait-Mediated Indirect Effects in Larval Anurans: Reversing Competition with the Threat of Predation,"Ecologists recently have been focusing on the role that trait-mediated indirect effects can have on community structure and composition. To date, this work has primarily focused on the effects of predator-induced behavioral plasticity on communities. However, predator-induced morphological plasticity, which has been documented in many taxa, might also lead to trait-mediated indirect effects. Here, I examined how predators altered the behavior and morphology of larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and leopard frogs (R. pipiens) and how these phenotypic changes altered the outcome of competition between the two species. Competition in the absence of caged predators was asymmetric; when reared separately, leopard frogs grew more than wood frogs, but when competing (without predators), wood frogs grew faster than leopard frogs. The presence of caged predators reversed the outcome of competition between the two anuran prey. In the presence of larval dragonflies (Anax spp.) or caged mudminnows (Umbra limi), leopard frogs grew faster than wood frogs while total tadpole biomass production remained unchanged. Thus, there was a predator-mediated indirect effect. Because predators alter both the behavior and morphology of larval anurans and both of these traits are known to affect resource consumption and growth, both are potential mechanisms to explain the change in competitive outcome. Changes in behavior were not related to changes in growth, but changes in morphology (specifically mouth width and tail length) were related to changes in growth. When competitors were added (without predators), wood frogs increased their mouth width by 10% and their tail length by 3%, while leopard frogs increased their mouth width by 5% and did not change their tail length. The greater increase in mouth width for wood frogs should increase their forage intake, since tadpoles feed by scraping periphyton; the importance of a 3% longer tail in competitive ability is unknown. The presence of the predator threat (via chemical cues from the caged predators) reduced both the mouth width and tail length in the two prey species to pre-competition levels. This response corresponded with the reduced competitive ability of the wood frogs. This work demonstrates that both competitors and predators can alter prey morphology and suggests that changes in morphology can cause trait-mediated indirect effects.",https://doi.org/10.2307/177114,0
2061,Trait‐mediated community assembly during experimental grassland restoration is altered by planting year rainfall,"Abstract Ecological restoration outcomes are highly variable, undermining efforts to recover biodiversity and ecosystem functions. One poorly understood source of variability is ‘year effects’—interannual variation in environmental conditions during the first year of restoration that alter successional trajectories of plant communities. There have been few experimental tests disentangling planting years from other differences among restoration projects (e.g. edaphic conditions, restoration approach), particularly those resolving mechanisms for year effects such as planting‐year rainfall. Moreover, past year effect studies focused almost exclusively on species‐level consequences. Therefore, the extent to which year effects influence the traits of communities is unknown. To address these gaps and provide a mechanistic test of how precipitation contributes to year effects, we conducted an experiment where we manipulated rainfall (drought, average and high levels) during the first growing season, replicated across three establishment year treatments to disentangle the effects of precipitation from other drivers of year effects. In each establishment year, we seeded the same species mix to initiate grassland restoration. We then surveyed plant community compositions annually for 5 years to quantify trait responses of restored communities to planting year rainfall. We found that variation in planting‐year precipitation altered community assembly trajectories by influencing community‐weighted mean (CWM) trait composition, and these effects persisted for at least 5 years. Over time, CWM specific leaf area and CWM seed mass decreased and CWM plant height increased. The effect of age on CWM plant height was stronger in plots that received mean and high watering treatments compared to drought treatments. This effect was also observed for CWM seed mass, albeit weaker. We also found some evidence for planting year effects unrelated to planting‐year rainfall for the three CWM traits, illustrating how interannually varying environmental conditions besides rainfall can generate persistent year effect on plant communities through their traits. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide evidence for planting year rainfall interacting with community assembly to alter the functional trait composition of restored grasslands. This suggests that interannual variation in rainfall during establishment is an important source of divergent biodiversity and functional outcomes in restored grasslands.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.14430,0
