0,A REVIEW OF TRAIT-MEDIATED INDIRECT INTERACTIONS IN ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES,"In this paper we review the empirical studies documenting trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) in food webs. Basic models and empirical approaches that form the foundation of our conceptualization of species interactions generally assume that interactions are an intrinsic property of the two interacting species and therefore are governed by their respective densities. However, if a species reacts to the presence of a second species by altering its phenotype, then the trait changes in the reacting species can alter the per capita effect of the reacting species on other species and, consequently, population density or fitness of the other species. Such trait-mediated indirect interactions can reinforce or oppose density-mediated effects and have been largely overlooked by community ecologists. We first briefly develop the case for the broad mechanistic basis for TMIIs and then review the direct evidence for TMIIs in various permutations of simple three- to four-species food webs. We find strong evidence for quantitatively significant effects of TMIIs in a variety of aquatic and terrestrial systems. We further highlight those few studies that address the question of the relative magnitudes of density- and trait-mediated effects and the role of species densities in their transmission. These studies indicate that trait effects are often as strong or stronger than density effects. We conclude that ecological communities are replete with TMIIs arising from trait plasticity and that these effects are quantitatively important to community dynamics. Finally, we synthesize our results and indicate profitable directions for future research. Corresponding Editor: F. R. Adler.

1,CONNECTING THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL STUDIES OF TRAIT-MEDIATED INTERACTIONS,"Trait-mediated interactions (TMIs), in which trophic and competitive interactions depend on individual traits as well as on overall population densities, have inspired large amounts of research, but theoretical and empirical studies have not been well connected. To help mitigate this problem, we review and synthesize the theoretical literature on TMIs and, in particular, on trait-mediated indirect interactions, TMIIs, in which the presence of one species mediates the interaction between a second and third species. (1) In models, TMIs tend to stabilize simple communities; adding further biological detail often reduces stability in models, but populations may persist even if their dynamics become mathematically unstable. (2) Short- and long-term changes in population density caused by TMIs depend even more on details, such as the curvature of functional responses and trade-offs, which have rarely been measured. (3) The effects of TMIs in multipredator communities depend in a straightforward way on the specificity of prey defenses. (4) Tritrophic and more complex communities are theoretically difficult; few general conclusions have emerged. Theory needs new kinds of experiments as a guide. The most critical needs are experiments that measure curvatures of trade-offs and responses, and experiments that (combined with theory) allow us to scale from short- to long-term responses of communities. Anecdotal evidence from long-term and large-scale studies suggests that TMIs may affect community dynamics at practical management scales; community models incorporating TMIs are necessary and require closer collaborations between theory and experiment.

2,TRAIT-MEDIATED INDIRECT INTERACTIONS IN A SIMPLE AQUATIC FOOD WEB,"This investigation examines the role of trait-mediated indirect interactions in a simple aquatic food web. We conducted the experiments in cattle watering tanks in order to establish whether competitive and predator–prey interactions between two species are affected by other species in the system; i.e., are pairwise interaction strengths affected by the background species assemblage? We examined the survival and growth response of small bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and small green frog (Rana clamitans) tadpoles in the presence and absence of a competitor (large bullfrogs), the lethal presence of the larval odonate predator Tramea lacerata, and the nonlethal (caged) presence of the larval odonate predators Anax junius and Anax longipes. We demonstrate that large bullfrog competitors and caged Anax affect traits (foraging activity level) of small bullfrog and small green frog tadpoles and that these changes in traits, in turn, affect interactions of the small tadpole species with each other and with the other species. In particular, the following four trait-mediated indirect interactions were evident: (1) Presence of large bullfrog competitors increased the predation rate of Tramea on small green frogs and small bullfrogs. (2) Presence of nonlethal Anax reduced the predation rate of Tramea on small green frogs. (3) Presence of nonlethal Anax increased the competitive advantage of bullfrogs over green frogs. (4) Presence of nonlethal Anax facilitated midge invasion of the experimental units. The proposed mechanisms (changes in small tadpole activity) involved in these trait-mediated indirect interactions were supported by observational data on tadpole activity and resource levels in the experimental units, and in laboratory experiments examining tadpole activity responses to predators. The occurrence of strong trait-mediated indirect interactions in this simple food web underscores the potential importance of such interactions in animal communities.",https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[1146:tmiiia]2.0.co;2,0
3,Trait-Mediated Indirect Interactions,"There is increasing evidence that the structure and functioning of ecological communities and ecosystems are strongly influenced by flexible traits of individuals within species. A deep understanding of how trait flexibility alters direct and indirect species interactions is crucial for addressing key issues in basic and applied ecology. This book provides an integrated perspective on the ecological and evolutionary consequences of interactions mediated by flexible species traits across a wide range of systems. It is the first volume synthesizing the rapidly expanding research field of trait-mediated indirect effects and highlights how the conceptual framework of these effects can aid the understanding of evolutionary processes, population dynamics, community structure and stability, and ecosystem function. It not only brings out the importance of this emerging field for basic ecological questions, but also explores the implications of trait-mediated interactions for the conservation of biodiversity and the response of ecosystems to anthropogenic environmental changes.",https://doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511736551,0
4,Variability in functional traits mediates plant interactions along stress gradients,"Summary Environmental gradients may influence a plant's physiological status and morphology, which in turn may affect plant–plant interactions. However, little is known about the relationship between environmental variation, physiological and morphological variability of plants and variation in the balance between competition and facilitation. Mountain ranges in dry environments have opposing altitudinal environmental gradients of temperature and aridity, which limit plant growth at high and low elevations. This makes them particularly suitable for exploring the relationships between environmental conditions, plant phenotype and plant–plant interactions. We hypothesized that different environmental stressors will differently affect the physiological status of a nurse plant. This, then, manifests itself as variation in nurse plant morphological traits, which in turn mediates plant–plant interactions by altering microhabitat conditions for the nurse and associated species. In an observational study, we measured a series of functional traits of Arenaria tetraquetra cushions as indicators of its physiological status (e.g. specific leaf area, relative water content) and morphology (e.g. cushion compactness, size). Measurements were taken along the entire elevation range where A. tetraquetra occurs. Furthermore, we analysed how these functional traits related to soil properties beneath cushions and the number of associated species and individuals compared with open areas. Cushions at high elevation showed good physiological status; they were compact and large, had higher soil water and organic matter content compared with open areas and showed the strongest facilitation effect of the whole elevation gradient – that is, the highest increase in species richness and abundance of beneficiaries compared with open areas. Physiological data at low elevation indicated stressful abiotic conditions for A. tetraquetra, which formed loose and small cushions. These cushions showed less improved soil conditions and had reduced facilitative effects compared with those at high elevation. Synthesis . Functional traits of the nurse species varied distinctively along the two opposing stress gradients, in parallel to the magnitude of differences in microenvironmental conditions between cushions and the surrounding open area, and also to the facilitation effect of cushions. Our data, therefore, provides a strong demonstration of the generally overlooked importance of a nurse plant's vigour and morphology for its facilitative effects.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12062,0
5,A Gain-of-Function Polymorphism Controlling Complex Traits and Fitness in Nature,"Identification of the causal genes that control complex trait variation remains challenging, limiting our appreciation of the evolutionary processes that influence polymorphisms in nature. We cloned a quantitative trait locus that controls plant defensive chemistry, damage by insect herbivores, survival, and reproduction in the natural environments where this polymorphism evolved. These ecological effects are driven by duplications in the BCMA (branched-chain methionine allocation) loci controlling this variation and by two selectively favored amino acid changes in the glucosinolate-biosynthetic cytochrome P450 proteins that they encode. These changes cause a gain of novel enzyme function, modulated by allelic differences in catalytic rate and gene copy number. Ecological interactions in diverse environments likely contribute to the widespread polymorphism of this biochemical function.",https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1221636,0
6,Evolution of a unique <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> chloroquine-resistance phenotype in association with <i>pfcrt</i> polymorphism in Papua New Guinea and South America,"The mechanistic basis for chloroquine resistance (CQR) in Plasmodium falciparum recently has been linked to the polymorphic gene pfcrt . Alleles associated with CQR in natural parasite isolates harbor threonine (T), as opposed to lysine (K) at amino acid 76. P. falciparum CQR strains of African and Southeast Asian origin carry pfcrt alleles encoding an amino acid haplotype of CVIET (residues 72–76), whereas most South American CQR strains studied carry an allele encoding an SVMNT haplotype; chloroquine-sensitive strains from malarious regions around the world carry a CVMNK haplotype. Upon investigating the origin of pfcrt alleles in Papua New Guinean (PNG) P. falciparum we found either the chloroquine-sensitive-associated CVMNK or CQR-associated SVMNT haplotypes previously seen in Brazilian isolates. Remarkably we did not find the CVIET haplotype observed in CQR strains from Southeast Asian regions more proximal to PNG. Further we found a previously undescribed CQR phenotype to be associated with the SVMNT haplotype from PNG and South America. This CQR phenotype is significantly less responsive to verapamil chemosensitization compared with the effect associated with the CVIET haplotype. Consistent with this, we observed that verapamil treatment of P. falciparum isolates carrying pfcrt SVMNT is associated with an attenuated increase in digestive vacuole pH relative to CVIET pfcrt -carrying isolates. These data suggest a key role for pH-dependent changes in hematin receptor concentration in the P. falciparum CQR mechanism. Our findings also suggest that P. falciparum CQR has arisen through multiple evolutionary pathways associated with pfcrt K76T.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.221440898,0

12,"DIVERSE TRAIT-MEDIATED INTERACTIONS IN A MULTI-PREDATOR, MULTI-PREY COMMUNITY","Trait-mediated interactions (TMII) can alter the outcome or magnitude of species interactions. We examined how the interaction between a guild of ground and rove beetles and their fly egg prey was altered by a larger predator, the ground beetle Pterostichus melanarius, and an additional prey, aphids. In field and laboratory experiments, we manipulated the presence or absence of P. melanarius and aphids and recorded the impact of these manipulations on beetle activity and fly egg predation. Individually, aphids, by serving as preferred prey, and P. melanarius, by reducing focal beetle activity, weakened egg predation. However, egg predation was restored when both aphids and P. melanarius were present together, because aphids triggered greater foraging activity, and thus increased incidental predation of fly eggs, by P. melanarius. Thus, TMII among subsets of the community that were disruptive to predation on fly eggs could not be summed to predict the dominant, positive TMII within a more diverse community. Future TMII studies should include more realistic representations of species diversity, and should not ignore the influence of prey on predator behavior.",https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1131:dtiiam]2.0.co;2,0
13,Size-dependent trait-mediated indirect interactions among sea urchin herbivores,"Despite their importance in community interactions, nonlethal indirect effects of predators are not well understood in many marine food webs. In this study, I found that within a guild of herbivorous sea urchins, small urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis and small Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) altered grazing rates in the presence of the predatory sea star (Pycnopodia helianthoides) and were highly preferred by the predator. In contrast, large urchins (adult S. franciscanus) did not significantly alter grazing in the presence of cues from the sea star and, when immobile, were less frequently attacked by the predator. However, the sea star's preference (active predator choice) was obscured by sea urchin mobility, that is, small S. franciscanus was only most preferred when unable to escape. These results suggest that by identifying the relative threat of predation facing guild members and the degree to which individuals transmit trait-mediated indirect interactions, these indirect effects may be predictably incorporated in community interactions.",https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arj014,0
14,The impacts of extreme and fluctuating temperatures on trait-mediated indirect aphid-parasitoid interactions,"1. Global climate change models predict an increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme temperature events. These temperature events, heatwaves for example, will impact a wide range of physiological and behavioural processes, particularly in ectotherms, and may therefore influence interactions between species. 2. Anti-predator responses may be more costly under more severe temperature regimes and therefore trait-mediated disturbance could lead to high mortality or reduced reproduction under extreme and fluctuating temperature regimes. 3. We examined the impacts of extreme and fluctuating temperatures on trait-mediated indirect interactions in an aphid–parasitoid community. 4. In treatments that isolated the effects of trait-mediated disturbance from the effects of foraging parasitoids we found that an increase in both the amplitude and frequency of peak temperatures reduced aphid numbers and provided evidence that the cost of trait-mediated disturbance could increase under frequent periods of high temperature. Aphid dispersal also increased with more frequent periods of high temperature. 5. In treatments where female wasps were allowed to freely forage (direct + trait-mediated effects), there was no evidence that extreme and fluctuating temperatures influenced the wasp's foraging ability. Exposure to extreme fluctuating temperatures did not influence the offspring production of exposed wasps or the position of the mummies within the plots.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2011.01292.x,0
15,Ecosystem engineering strengthens bottom-up and weakens top-down effects via trait-mediated indirect interactions,"Trophic interactions and ecosystem engineering are ubiquitous and powerful forces structuring ecosystems, yet how these processes interact to shape natural systems is poorly understood. Moreover, trophic effects can be driven by both density- and trait-mediated interactions. Microcosm studies demonstrate that trait-mediated interactions may be as strong as density-mediated interactions, but the relative importance of these pathways at natural spatial and temporal scales is underexplored. Here, we integrate large-scale field experiments and microcosms to examine the effects of ecosystem engineering on trophic interactions while also exploring how ecological scale influences density- and trait-mediated interaction pathways. We demonstrate that (i) ecosystem engineering can shift the balance between top-down and bottom-up interactions, (ii) such effects can be driven by cryptic trait-mediated interactions, and (iii) the relative importance of density- versus trait-mediated interaction pathways can be scale dependent. Our findings reveal the complex interplay between ecosystem engineering, trophic interactions, and ecological scale in structuring natural systems.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2017.0894,0
16,Susceptibility to Predation Affects Trait-Mediated Indirect Interactions by Reversing Interspecific Competition,"Numerous studies indicate that the behavioral responses of prey to the presence of predators can have an important role in structuring assemblages through trait-mediated indirect interactions. Few studies, however, have addressed how relative susceptibility to predation influences such interactions. Here we examine the effect of chemical cues from the common shore crab Carcinus maenas on the foraging behavior of two common intertidal gastropod molluscs. Of the two model consumers studied, Littorina littorea is morphologically more vulnerable to crab predation than Gibbula umbilicalis, and it exhibited greater competitive ability in the absence of predation threat. However, Littorina demonstrated a greater anti-predator response when experimentally exposed to predation cues, resulting in a lower level of foraging. This reversed the competitive interaction, allowing Gibbula substantially increased access to shared resources. Our results demonstrate that the susceptibility of consumers to predation can influence species interactions, and suggest that inter-specific differences in trait-mediated indirect interactions are another mechanism through which non-consumptive predator effects may influence trophic interactions.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0023068,0
17,Female behaviour and the interaction of male and female genital traits mediate sperm transfer during mating,"Natural selection and post-copulatory sexual selection, including sexual conflict, contribute to genital diversification. Fundamental first steps in understanding how these processes shape the evolution of specific genital traits are to determine their function experimentally and to understand the interactions between female and male genitalia during copulation. Our experimental manipulations of male and female genitalia in red-sided garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis) reveal that copulation duration and copulatory plug deposition, as well as total and oviductal/vaginal sperm counts, are influenced by the interaction between male and female genital traits and female behaviour during copulation. By mating females with anesthetized cloacae to males with spine-ablated hemipenes using a fully factorial design, we identified significant female-male copulatory trait interactions and found that females prevent sperm from entering their oviducts by contracting their vaginal pouch. Furthermore, these muscular contractions limit copulatory plug size, whereas the basal spine of the male hemipene aids in sperm and plug transfer. Our results are consistent with a role of sexual conflict in mating interactions and highlight the evolutionary importance of female resistance to reproductive outcomes.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jeb.12836,0
18,Trait-mediated indirect interactions of ant shape on the attack of caterpillars and fruits,"Mainly owing to their high diversity and abundance, ants are formidable as predators and defenders of foliage. Consequently, ants can exclude both invertebrate and vertebrate activity on plants via direct and indirect interactions as already shown in many previous studies. Here we present empirical evidence that objects resembling ant shape on dummy caterpillars were able to repel visually oriented predators. Moreover, we also show that rubber ants on dummy fruits can repel potential fruit dispersers. Our results have direct implications on the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of interactions in ant-based systems, as ant presence could affect the fitness of its partners. In short, our study highlights the importance of visual cues in interspecific interactions and opens a new way to study the effects of ant presence to test ecological and evolutionary hypotheses.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2016.0401,0
19,"Biogeography, macroecology and species' traits mediate competitive interactions in the order<scp>L</scp>agomorpha","Abstract In addition to abiotic determinants, biotic factors, including competitive, interspecific interactions, limit species' distributions. Environmental changes in human disturbance, land use and climate are predicted to have widespread impacts on interactions between species, especially in the order L agomorpha due to the higher latitudes and more extreme environmental conditions they occupy. We reviewed the published literature on interspecific interactions in the order L agomorpha and compared the biogeography, macroecology, phylogeny and traits of species known to interact with those of species with no reported interactions, to investigate how projected future environmental change may affect interactions and potentially alter species' distributions. Thirty‐three lagomorph species have competitive interactions reported in the literature; the majority involve hares ( L epus sp.) or the eastern cottontail rabbit ( S ylvilagus floridanus ). Key regions for interactions are located between 30–50° N of the E quator, and include eastern A sia (southern R ussia on the border of M ongolia) and N orth A merica (north‐western USA ). Closely related, large‐bodied, similarly sized species occurring in regions of human‐modified, typically agricultural landscapes, or at high elevations, are significantly more likely to have reported competitive interactions than other lagomorph species. We identify species' traits associated with competitive interactions, and highlight some potential impacts that future environmental change may have on interspecific interactions. Our approach using bibliometric and biological data is widely applicable, and with relatively straightforward methodologies, can provide insights into interactions between species. Our results have implications for predicting species' responses to global change, and we advise that capturing, parameterizing and incorporating interspecific interactions into analyses (e.g. species distribution modelling) may be more important than suggested by the literature.",https://doi.org/10.1111/mam.12035,0

We determined whether TMIIs occur in rocky tidepool communities on the west coast of the USA. In the laboratory, both adults and juveniles of the keystone predator Pisaster ochraceus and adults of a smaller predatory seastar Leptasterias spp. caused the abundant herbivorous snail Tegula funebralis to stop foraging and flee the water, inducing a positive TMII on micro- and macroalgae. Snails preferred 3 common species of macroalgae (Ulva lactuca, Cladophora columbiana and Porphyra spp.) over 4 others, indicating that seastars might provide the strongest benefits to these species in tidepools. In the laboratory, snails responded rapidly to both species of predatory seastars and many more snails responded than could be eaten; thus, there is a potential for TMIIs to occur in natural populations. Snails responded to waterborne cues from P. ochraceus by reducing grazing and leaving still water, and reducing grazing in laminar flow (0.5 l min-1), resulting in TMII effects at least as far as 75 cm away. Adult P. ochraceus and Leptasterias spp. introduced to tidepools during low tide induced many snails to flee the tidepools. Considerable individual variation occurred in the responses of snails. Medium and large snails mediated TMIIs and hungry snails were marginally less responsive to seastars potentially altering TMII strength in nature. Thus, we demonstrated that TMIIs could occur in natural tidepools and showed how predator and algal identity, predator and prey size, water flow and prey hunger level may influence these TMIIs.

21,Moving beyond linear food chains: trait-mediated indirect interactions in a rocky intertidal food web,"In simple, linear food chains, top predators can have positive indirect effects on basal resources by causing changes in the traits (e.g. behaviour, feeding rates) of intermediate consumers. Although less is known about trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) in more complex food webs, it has been suggested that such complexity dampens trophic cascades. We examined TMIIs between a predatory crab ( Carcinus maenas ) and two ecologically important basal resources, fucoid algae ( Ascophyllum nodosum ) and barnacles ( Semibalanus balanoides ), which are consumed by herbivorous ( Littorina littorea ) and carnivorous ( Nucella lapillus ) snails, respectively. Because crab predation risk suppresses snail feeding rates, we hypothesized that crabs would also shape direct and indirect interactions among the multiple consumers and resources. We found that the magnitude of TMIIs between the crab and each resource depended on the suite of intermediate consumers present in the food web. Carnivorous snails ( Nucella ) transmitted TMIIs between crabs and barnacles. However, crab–algae TMIIs were transmitted by both herbivorous ( Littorina ) and carnivorous ( Nucella ) snails, and these TMIIs were additive. By causing Nucella to consume fewer barnacles, crab predation risk allowed fucoids that had settled on or between barnacles to remain in the community. Hence, positive interactions between barnacles and algae caused crab–algae TMIIs to be strongest when both consumers were present. Studies of TMIIs in more realistic, reticulate food webs will be necessary for a more complete understanding of how predation risk shapes community dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2016.2590,0
22,Trait-Mediated Indirect Interactions in a Simple Aquatic Food Web,"This investigation examines the role of trait-mediated indirect interactions in a simple aquatic food web. We conducted the experiments in cattle watering tanks in order to establish whether competitive and predator–prey interactions between two species are affected by other species in the system; i.e., are pairwise interaction strengths affected by the background species assemblage? We examined the survival and growth response of small bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and small green frog (Rana clamitans) tadpoles in the presence and absence of a competitor (large bullfrogs), the lethal presence of the larval odonate predator Tramea lacerata, and the nonlethal (caged) presence of the larval odonate predators Anax junius and Anax longipes. We demonstrate that large bullfrog competitors and caged Anax affect traits (foraging activity level) of small bullfrog and small green frog tadpoles and that these changes in traits, in turn, affect interactions of the small tadpole species with each other and with the other species. In particular, the following four trait-mediated indirect interactions were evident: (1) Presence of large bullfrog competitors increased the predation rate of Tramea on small green frogs and small bullfrogs. (2) Presence of nonlethal Anax reduced the predation rate of Tramea on small green frogs. (3) Presence of nonlethal Anax increased the competitive advantage of bullfrogs over green frogs. (4) Presence of nonlethal Anax facilitated midge invasion of the experimental units. The proposed mechanisms (changes in small tadpole activity) involved in these trait-mediated indirect interactions were supported by observational data on tadpole activity and resource levels in the experimental units, and in laboratory experiments examining tadpole activity responses to predators. The occurrence of strong trait-mediated indirect interactions in this simple food web underscores the potential importance of such interactions in animal communities.",https://doi.org/10.2307/2265865,0
23,Behavioral responses to environmental change alter direct and indirect trait-mediated interactions,"We used a field-based experiment to explore the consequences of altered environmental conditions on a predator–prey–resource system. The foraging choices of grasshoppers on plant resources were measured in the presence and absence of predator spiders and in shaded and unshaded conditions. We show that shading conditions affected the spiders, their direct behavioral interactions with the grasshoppers, and the indirect behaviorally mediated interactions between the spiders and the plants. In unshaded conditions in response to spiders, grasshoppers reduced their energy intake by 90%, reduced their time spent feeding by 68%, and switched to a largely grass diet that should increase mortality, while in shaded conditions spiders induced no behavioral shift. In no shade, spiders had an indirect positive effect on forb plants as evidenced by a trophic cascade pattern in plant biomass in the one-, two-, and three-trophic-level communities. But in shade, there was no indirect interaction of the spiders on the plants. Our results demonstrate the challenge of predicting the effects of environmental change on complex, real-world ecosystems and highlight the critical need for conducting experimental manipulations in the proper context with full complements of species.",https://doi.org/10.1139/z06-076,0
24,Trait-Mediated Effects of Parasitic Phorid Flies (Diptera: Phoridae) on Ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) Competition and Resource Access in Coffee Agro-ecosystems,"Predator effects on prey traits change competitive interactions between prey species affecting resource use. Parasitic phorid flies limit competitive-dominant ant activity, potentially meditating competitive interactions between ant species, changing competitive hierarchies, or affecting ant communities. I considered interactions between phorids (Pseudacteon sp.), their ant host (Azteca instabilis F. Smith), and co-occurring ant species in coffee agro-ecosystems testing whether phorids (1) limit A. instabilis recruitment activity, (2) affect competitive interaction between ant species, and (3) are associated with other species' resource access and therefore have the potential to change competitive hierarchies. I monitored recruitment of A. instabilis and other ants to baits over 90 min on canopy trees with or without phorids. A. instabilis were one-half as abundant with phorids. Other species gained access to baits 12 times more often and were only able to take over baits when phorids were present. Furthermore, many more species (13 versus 2) gained access to resources when phorids were present. These results indicate that phorids mediate competitive interactions between ant species and may influence ant communities by affecting resource availability. Considering that phorids limit A. instabilis attacks on herbivores and that ant species differ in effects on arthropod communities, phorids may have strong community-level effects in coffee agro-ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1603/0046-225x(2005)034[1089:teoppf]2.0.co;2,0
25,The impact of trait-mediated indirect interactions in marine communities,"Marine communities have served as productive laboratories for the discovery of fundamental processes and mechanisms driving community structure and function (e.g., Paine 1966; Connell 1961; Dayton 1975). Within these communities, inducible responses are ubiquitous; extending from the seafloor to the sea-surface, and from microscopic plankton to charismatic marine megafauna (e.g., Harvell 1990; Toth and Pavia 2007; Hay 2009; Vaughn and Allen 2010). These changes may influence energy and nutrient cycling within and among ecosystems (Hay and Kubanek 2002; Long et al. 2007b). Over the past decade, marine ecologists have begun to demonstrate the often dramatic, cascading consequences of these trait modifications on co-occurring species and thus community structure and function. These trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) influence trophic cascades (Trussell et al. 2002; Grabowski and Kimbro 2005), competition between herbivores (Denno et al. 2000; Long et al. 2007a, 2011), apparent competition (Schmitt 1987), herbivore population dynamics (Denno et al. 2000), linkage across ecosystems (Nevitt et al. 1995) and energy flow and food chain length (Trussell et al. 2006b). In this chapter we discuss how TMIIs affect marine populations, communities and sometimes ecosystems, and consider the insights that can be gained from understanding and contrasting marine patterns and processes with those occurring in terrestrial or freshwater systems.",https://doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511736551.007,0
26,"Trait-mediated indirect interactions, density-mediated indirect interactions, and direct interactions between mammalian and insect herbivores","Ecologists have traditionally recognized the consequences that direct interactions between species have on the functioning of ecological communities and on the flow of energy through food webs (Pimm 2002). However, ecological communities are among the most complex natural systems, and thus the interactions between species are far from simple. In this respect, the importance of indirect effects (those effects transmitted from one species to another through one or more intermediate species) as a determinant of the structure and dynamics of ecological communities has been clearly acknowledged only in recent years (Wootton 1994, Abrams 1995, Abrams et al. 1996). Indirect effects are those transmitted from one species to another through one or more intermediate species. These indirect effects can be propagated through food webs as a consequence of changes in the density of the intervening species, a mechanism known as density-mediated indirect interaction (DMII) (Abrams 1995, Werner and Peacor 2003). Nevertheless, indirect effects can also occur through changes in the phenotypes of the interacting organisms, a mechanism known as trait-mediated indirect interaction (TMII) (Werner and Peacor 2003, Schmitz et al. 2004). Although DMIIs have been traditionally considered to be the main source of any variation in ecological communities, ecologists are progressively more conscious of the essential role played by TMIIs (Bolker et al. 2003, Dill et al. 2003, Luttbeg et al. 2003, Trussell et al. 2003, Werner and Peacor 2003; and chapters throughout this volume).",https://doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511542701.006,0
27,Trait-mediated indirect interactions in invasions: unique behavioral responses of an invasive ant to plant nectar,"Exotic species often form beneficial, facultative associations with indigenous species. However, we still have a limited understanding of the influences that these positive associations may have on the dynamics and impacts of species invasions. Highly invasive species may respond differently than less invasive species to resources that are exchanged in mutualisms, leading to trait-mediated indirect interactions between native species via invaders that may reshape native communities. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the highly invasive ant species, Anoplolepis gracilipes, exhibits stronger trait changes in response to increasing levels of nectar than co-occurring, less invasive ant species. Across two islands in the Samoan Archipelago, we located multiple sites dominated by A. gracilipes and multiple sites dominated by other, less invasive species. At each site, we manipulated nectar levels on a common extrafloral nectary-bearing shrub and assessed short-term changes in ant worker recruitment and aggression. We found that the recruitment response of the highly invasive ant species A. gracilipes was not unique: other dominant ant species also increased recruitment in response to increasing nectar levels. However, A. gracilipes did show unique changes in aggressive behaviors: as nectar levels increased, the proportion of prey discovered, attacked and removed by A. gracilipes workers and the speed at which they performed these aggressive behaviors all increased strongly. Other ant species showed no such responses. In addition, fewer subordinate ants persisted on plants at sites invaded by A. gracilipes. Finally, plot-level, simultaneous manipulations of ant access to the plants and nectar availability demonstrated that Morinda citrifolia-ant mutualisms influenced the β-diversity of local arthropod communities differently when A. gracilipes dominated local ant assemblages. These results suggest that mutualisms between invasive ants and native plants can modify interactions between invaders and co-occurring arthropods, possibly leading to more negative consequences for native communities. They also underscore the importance of incorporating both positive species interactions and indirect pathways into our studies of both community ecology and invasion biology.",https://doi.org/10.1890/es11-00145.1,0

29,Trait-mediated indirect interactions in size-structured populations,"Ecological communities are complex networks of interacting species, and it has been a central challenge in community ecology to understand and predict their dynamics. To deal with this daunting complexity, scientists typically abstract these communities into more tractable subcomponents, such as food web modules (e.g., food chains, predator–prey interactions, competitive interactions) (Holt 1997), to elucidate the causal mechanisms that determine the dynamics of species interactions. However, even at this reduced level of complexity, researchers face the challenge of how much detail should be included to capture the full dynamics of natural communities without getting tangled up in details or losing generality.",https://doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511736551.008,0
30,The aquatic moth Acentria ephemerella as a key species in submerged aquatic vegetation : direct and trait-mediated interactions with predators and food plants,"The perfoliate pondweed Potamogeton perfoliatus constitutes large mono-specific macrophyte patches in many Central European lakes. Correlative evidence from the field suggests that Potamogeton is under an increasing grazing pressure during its short vegetation period from May to September due to seasonal outbreaks of the aquatic moth Acentria ephemerella. We used a mesocosm experiment to determine the influence of Acentria herbivory on Potamogeton shoot development and resting bud production and to study the defence strategies of this macrophyte. Herbivory resulted in a reduction of the Potamogeton vegetation period by more than two months, thereby reducing the average resting bud size and the overall resting bud biomass seven-fold. This suggests that, besides its severe immediate effects, herbivory will affect Potamogeton growth and dynamics also during the subsequent season. As a response to herbivory Potamogeton retranslocated nutrients (phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N)) from leaves towards resting buds and changed its allocation strategy in the size versus number of resting buds. This change in the number versus size trade-off might allow the plant to produce a minimum resting bud size necessary for successful sprouting in the next spring. Acentria larvae had a high P content implying P limitation of larval growth especially within the herbivory",,0
31,Keep Your Eggs Away: Ant Presence Reduces Ceratitis capitata Oviposition Behaviour through Trait-Mediated Indirect Interactions,"Alternative methods to achieve sustainable agricultural production while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, such as biological control, are increasingly needed. The exploitation of trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs), in which pests modify their behavior in response to some cues (e.g., pheromones and other semiochemicals) to avoid predation risk, may be a possible strategy. In this study, we tested the effect of TMIIs of two Mediterranean ant species, Crematogaster scutellaris and Tapinoma nigerrimum, on the oviposition behaviour of Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae), one of the world's most economically damaging pests, which attacks fruits. For each ant species, we performed choice experiments using ant-scented and control plums, counting the time spent by medflies on fruits and the number of pupae emerging from them. Results of both ant species tests showed a significantly shorter time spent by ovipositing medflies on ant-exposed plums and a lower number of pupae, when compared to the control group. Our findings highlighted that the semiochemicals released by ants on plums triggered an avoidance behaviour by medfly females, leading to lower oviposition rates. This study contributes to the understanding of indirect ant-pest interactions in Mediterranean agricultural settings and points out the potential of utilising ant-borne semiochemicals in sustainable IPM strategies.",https://doi.org/10.3390/insects14060532,0
32,Plant trait-mediated interactions between early and late herbivores on common figwort (<i>Scrophularia nodosa</i>) and effects on plant seed set,"This study examined the interactive effects of early and late season herbivory on the growth and reproductive output of figwort (Scrophularia nodosa). The early season herbivore is a pentatomid bug that feeds on and kills the apical meristem, while the late season herbivores are 2 weevil species and a sawfly that all feed on leaves and flowers. The direct effect of early season meristem damage on plant reproduction was quite limited, although meristem damage did cause increased branching. This change in plant morphology may entail that early season herbivores have profound indirect effects on plant reproduction by affecting the abundance of and damage caused by late season herbivores. Comparisons of plants with and without early season meristem damage, natural and artificial, also suggest that plants with meristem damage are significantly shorter throughout most of the summer and receive less damage late in season. However, the reduced damage translated to increased flowering but not to increased fruit production, suggesting that the plants were able to compensate for late season damage. In the end, and despite damage, figwort was well able to tolerate the observed meristem and leaf damage.",https://doi.org/10.2980/18-4-3422,0
33,Interactions between the developmental and adult social environments mediate group dynamics and offspring traits in Drosophila melanogaster,"Developmental conditions can strongly influence adult phenotypes and social interactions, which in turn affect key evolutionary processes such as sexual selection and sexual conflict. While the implications of social interactions in phenotypically mixed populations at the individual level are increasingly well known, how these effects influence the fate of groups remains poorly understood, which limits our understanding of the broader ecological implications. To address this problem we manipulated adult phenotypes and social composition in Drosophila melanogaster - by experimentally manipulating the larval density of the group-members - and measured a range of group-level outcomes across the lifespan of groups. Adult groups composed of exclusively low larval-density individuals showed high courtship levels, and low early reproductive rates, group growth rates, offspring mass and offspring eclosion success, relative to high larval-density or mixed larval-density groups. Furthermore, high larval-density groups had lower survival. Offspring mass increased with time, but at a reduced rate in groups when male group members (but not females) were from a mixture of larval-densities; peak reproductive rates were also earlier in these groups. Our results suggest that that variation in developmental conditions experienced by adult group members can modify the reproductive output of groups.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-03505-2,0
34,Pollinator biological traits and ecological interactions mediate the impacts of mosquito-targeting malathion application,"Abstract Mosquito adulticides are perceived by the public as detrimental to nontarget arthropods, contributing to declines of native and beneficial insects. However, the actual impact of adulticides on nontarget arthropods in nature needs to incorporate biological and ecological elements. Here, we investigated the effect of biological/behavioral traits (butterfly roosting at different heights, roosting in sites underneath foliage, bumblebee hive usage) and interactions (parasitism, predation) of pollinators (butterflies and bumblebees) that could mediate the impacts of malathion application in manipulative semi-field experiments in Florida, USA. Roosting height from the spray route had a significant negative relationship with mortality of butterflies treated with ULV malathion, with high survival at the highest roosting height (7 m), but butterflies roosting among vegetation did not have higher survival. Bumblebees with hive access had significantly higher survival than bumblebees without hive access. Host plants treated with ULV malathion significantly reduced parasitism of monarch eggs by Trichogramma platneri, but increased predation of monarch caterpillars by Polistes paper wasps. These data provide insight into the realistic impacts of adulticide applications on pollinators in nature which will enable mosquito control districts to better limit nontarget effects of adulticide treatments and may help to address concerns related to potential nontarget effects.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-20823-2,0
35,Predation Risk Reverses the Potential Effects of Warming on Plant-Herbivore Interactions by Altering the Relative Strengths of Trait- and Density-Mediated Interactions,"Climate warming will initiate numerous changes in ecological community structure and function, and such high-level impacts derive from temperature-driven changes in individual physiology. Specifically, top-down control of plant biomass is sensitive to rising temperatures, but the direction of change depends on a complex interaction between temperature, predation risk, and predator thermal preference. Here, I developed an individual-based optimal foraging model of three trophic levels (primary producers, herbivores, and predators) to examine how warming affects top-down control of primary producers via both trait- and density-mediated indirect interactions (TMII and DMII). This model also factorially crossed warm- and cold-adapted herbivores and predators to determine how local adaptation modifies the effects of warming on food web interactions. Regardless of predator thermal preference, warming increased herbivore foraging effort and by extension predation rates. As a result, TMII declined in importance at high temperatures regardless of predator thermal adaptation. Finally, predation risk reduced herbivore fitness via both indirect (i.e., reduced herbivore size) and direct (i.e., reduced herbivore survival) pathways. These results suggest that, contrary to previous predictions, warming might stimulate primary productivity by reducing herbivore population sizes, releasing plants from immediate top-down control.",https://doi.org/10.1086/692605,0

The role of aquatic vegetation in mediating predator-prey interactions by providing refuges for prey or perching sites for predators was further addressed.",,0
37,Arbuscular mycorrhizal interactions and nutrient supply mediate floral trait variation and pollinator visitation,"Summary Floral traits, including floral display and nutritional rewards from pollen and nectar, drive pollinator visitation. Even within a single plant species, environmental factors can influence the quality and quantity of floral resources. Yet, the ecological interactions driving this variation in floral resources, especially those belowground, remain unknown. Here, we investigate how soil microbial community composition and nutrient availability, specifically distinct arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) species and phosphorus (P) supply, affect plant growth, AMF traits, floral traits, and how that, in turn, affects bee visitation. We found that increased AMF richness of functional diversity enhanced floral display (flower size and number) and rewards (nectar volume and pollen protein) and increased bee visitation. Using structural equation modeling, we found that AMF associations could boost bee visitation by enhancing flower size. However, trade‐offs occur; flower size correlates negatively with root colonization but positively with hyphal length, suggesting that AMF traits drive the effects of AMF on flower growth. Overall, the effect of AMF on floral traits and bee visitation was not homogenous; instead, AMF trait differences interact with P supply, resulting in varying effects on floral traits and subsequently bee foraging dynamics. These results highlight that focusing on beneficial belowground interactions could provide an opportunity to bolster bee visitation.",https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.20219,0

Ringuelet' (ILPLA, CONICET), Universidad Nacional de La Plata, 1900 La Plata, Argentina *Corresponding author: acanepuc@mdp.edu.ar ABSTRACT: Studies on bidirectional benefactor-beneficiary interactions between organisms have generally neglected the importance of this feedback in trophic levels other than plants. The burrowing crab Neohelice granulata aids the development of larvae of the stem-boring moth Haimbachia sp. nov. within the stems of Spartina alterniflora. In our research, we evaluated whether the stem-boring moth subsequently influences crab feeding on these marsh plants. Surveys and experiments in a tidal marsh of the SW Atlantic coast (36°22'S) showed that at the beginning of the stem-boring moth attack there was no difference in crab herbivory between plants with or without larvae of the stem-boring moth. However, after 3.5 mo, crabs foraged more on plants without larvae than on those with larvae. Plant tissue analyses showed a decrease in leaf tissue carbon concentrations in plants with larvae. This change in the nutritional quality of leaves, caused by construction of the stem-boring moth galleries, could explain the segregation in plant use between both herbivores. Unlike an allelochemical response, the non-specificity of the induced nutritional change could impair a wide variety of herbivores regardless of their feeding modes or taxonomic proximity. These effects could propagate bottom-up through the food-web, leading to more diffuse interspecific effects. Thus, here we show how the benefactor-beneficiary feedback between herbivores can be important for the maintenance of species coexistence and the functioning of communities.

39,Tree seedling shade tolerance arises from interactions with microbes and is mediated by functional traits,"Shade tolerance is a central concept in forest ecology and strongly influences forest community dynamics. However, the plant traits and conditions conferring shade tolerance are yet to be resolved. We propose that shade tolerance is shaped not only by responses to light but also by a species’ defense and recovery functional traits, soil microbial communities, and interactions of these factors with light availability. We conducted a greenhouse experiment for three temperate species in the genus Acer that vary in shade tolerance. We grew newly germinated seedlings in two light levels (2% and 30% sun) and controlled additions of microbial filtrates using a wet-sieving technique. Microbial filtrate treatments included: &amp;lt;20 µm, likely dominated by pathogenic microbes; 40-250 µm, containing arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF); combination, including both filtrate sizes; and sterilized combination. We monitored survival for nine weeks and measured fine root AMF colonization, hypocotyl phenolics, stem lignin, and stem+root nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) at three-week intervals. We found that differences in seedling survival between low and high light only occurred when microbes were present. AMF colonization, phenolics, and NSC generally increased with light. Phenolics were greater with &amp;lt;20 µm microbial filtrate, suggesting that soil-borne pathogens may induce phenolic production; and NSC was greater with 40-250 µm filtrate, suggesting that mycorrhizal fungi may induce NSC production. Across species, microbe treatments, and light availability, survival increased as phenolics and NSC increased. Therefore, shade tolerance may be explained by interactions among soil-borne microbes, seedling traits, and light availability, providing a more mechanistic and trait-based explanation of shade tolerance and thus forest community dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2023.1224540,0
40,"Phenotypic divergence of traits that mediate antagonistic and mutualistic interactions between island and continental populations of the tropical plant, <i>Tribulus cistoides</i> (Zygophyllaceae)","Abstract Island systems have long served as a model for evolutionary processes due to their unique species interactions. Many studies of the evolution of species interactions on islands have focused on endemic taxa. Fewer studies have focused on how antagonistic and mutualistic interactions shape the phenotypic divergence of widespread nonendemic species living on islands. We used the widespread plant Tribulus cistoides (Zygophyllaceae) to study phenotypic divergence in traits that mediate antagonistic interactions with vertebrate granivores (birds) and mutualistic interactions with pollinators, including how this is explained by bioclimatic variables. We used both herbarium specimens and field‐collected samples to compare phenotypic divergence between continental and island populations. Fruits from island populations were larger than on continents, but the presence of lower spines on mericarps was less frequent on islands. The presence of spines was largely explained by environmental variation among islands. Petal length was on average 9% smaller on island than continental populations, an effect that was especially accentuated on the Galápagos Islands. Our results show that Tribulus cistoides exhibits phenotypic divergence between island and continental habitats for antagonistic traits (seed defense) and mutualistic traits (floral traits). Furthermore, the evolution of phenotypic traits that mediate antagonistic and mutualistic interactions partially depended on the abiotic characteristics of specific islands. This study shows the potential of using a combination of herbarium and field samples for comparative studies on a globally distributed species to study phenotypic divergence on island habitats.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9766,0

42,Higher Order Interactions in Ecological Communities: What Are They and How Can They be Detected?,"The detection and significance of higher order interactions (HOIs) between species has been a matter of debate and experimentation in community ecology for several decades. HOIs are considered potentially significant because their presence is assumed to mean that the dynamic behavior of a full community of species is unpredictable based on observations of interactions between subsets of the species within the community. Despite such attention, the causal mechanisms that produce HOIs have been inadequately discussed. We discuss three different usages of the term HOIs and provide insight as to why HOIs might be found within a given community. HOIs may be detected for three reasons: inappropriate assumptions made concerning species interactions that influence statistical tests, unmeasured parameters and variables, and interaction modifications (i.e., a functional change in the interaction of two species caused by a third species. This confusion concerning the defining attributes of HOIs has made their detection problematic. While the statistical tests being used in the ecological experiments to detect HOIs are described in detail in most papers, the dynamic models underlying these tests are often not made explicit. Additionally, we demonstrate the equivalency of three different statistical tests: the Case and Bender (1981) test, analysis of variance, and a multiplicative test (Wootton 1994). However, the choice of a response variable (i.e., population densities, population growth rates, per—capita growth rates, etc.) and different data transformations applied to these response variables alter the underlying dynamics model that is being tested. The result is that the statistical test applied does not always perform the intended comparison but instead tests a different and sometimes unjustified or even inappropriate dynamic model. Finally, we review the relationship between indirect effects and HOIs. Whereas some researchers have lumped HOIs and indirect effects, we argue that the two represent completely unique and separate phenomena. Additionally, indirect effects can complicate detection of HOIs, and we review several methods by which to separate the two processes.",https://doi.org/10.2307/1939614,0
43,Competition Between Aquatic Insects and Vertebrates: Interaction Strength and Higher Order Interactions,"Replicated experiments in artificial ponds demonstrated that an assemblage of aquatic insects competed with tadpoles of the frogs Hyla andersonii and Bufo woodhousei fowleri. We independently manipulated the presence or absence of aquatic insects, and the abundance of an anuran competitor (O or 150 Bufo w. fowleri per experimental pond), using a completely crossed design for two—factor variance analysis, and observed the responses of initially similar cohorts of Hyla andersonii tadpoles to neither, either, or both insect and anuran competitors. Insects and Bufo significantly depressed the mean individual mass at metamorphosis of Hyla froglets and the cumulative biomass of anurans leaving the ponds at metamorphosis. Neither insects nor Bufo affected the survival or larval period of Hyla. Insects also significantly reduced the mean mass of Bufo, showing that both anurans responded to competition from insects. The intensity of competition between natural densities of insects and Hyla tadpoles was comparable to the intensity of competition between Bufo and Hyla, as a density of 150 Bufo/1000 L.",https://doi.org/10.2307/1941637,0
44,The mechanistic basis for higher-order interactions and non-additivity in competitive communities,"Motivated by both analytical tractability and empirical practicality, community ecologists have long treated the species pair as the fundamental unit of study. This notwithstanding, the challenge of understanding more complex systems has repeatedly generated interest in the role of so-called higher-order interactions (HOIs) imposed by species beyond the focal pair. Here we argue that HOIs - defined as non-additive effects of density on per capita growth - are best interpreted as emergent properties of phenomenological models (e.g. Lotka-Volterra competition) rather than as distinct 'ecological processes' in their own right. Using simulations of consumer-resource models, we explore the mechanisms and system properties that give rise to HOIs in observational data. We demonstrate that HOIs emerge under all but the most restrictive of assumptions, and that incorporating non-additivity into phenomenological models improves the quantitative and qualitative accuracy of model predictions. Notably, we also observe that HOIs derive primarily from mechanisms and system properties that apply equally to single-species or pairwise systems as they do to more diverse communities. Consequently, there exists a strong mandate for further recognition of non-additive effects in both theoretical and empirical research.",https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13211,0
45,Higher order interactions and species coexistence,"Abstract Higher order interactions (HOIs) have been suggested to stabilize diverse ecological communities. However, their role in maintaining species coexistence from the perspective of modern coexistence theory is not known. Here, using generalized Lotka-Volterra model, we derive a general rule for species coexistence modulated by HOIs. We show that where pairwise species interactions fail to promote species coexistence in regions of extreme fitness differences, negative HOIs that intensify pairwise competition, however, can promote coexistence provided that HOIs strengthen intraspecific competition more than interspecific competition. In contrast, positive HOIs that alleviate pairwise competition can stabilize coexistence across a wide range of fitness differences, irrespective of differences in strength of inter- and intraspecific competition. In addition, we extend our three-species analytical result to multispecies communities and show, using simulations, that multispecies coexistence is possible provided that strength of negative intraspecific HOIs is higher than interspecific HOIs. Our work sheds light on the underlying mechanisms through which HOIs can maintain species diversity.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12080-020-00481-8,0
46,Coexistence in diverse communities with higher-order interactions,"A central assumption in most ecological models is that the interactions in a community operate only between pairs of species. However, two species may interactively affect the growth of a focal species. Although interactions among three or more species, called higher-order interactions, have the potential to modify our theoretical understanding of coexistence, ecologists lack clear expectations for how these interactions shape community structure. Here we analytically predict and numerically confirm how the variability and strength of higher-order interactions affect species coexistence. We found that as higher-order interaction strengths became more variable across species, fewer species could coexist, echoing the behavior of pairwise models. If interspecific higher-order interactions became too harmful relative to self-regulation, coexistence in diverse communities was destabilized, but coexistence was also lost when these interactions were too weak and mutualistic higher-order effects became prevalent. This behavior depended on the functional form of the interactions as the destabilizing effects of the mutualistic higher-order interactions were ameliorated when their strength saturated with species' densities. Last, we showed that more species-rich communities structured by higher-order interactions lose species more readily than their species-poor counterparts, generalizing classic results for community stability. Our work provides needed theoretical expectations for how higher-order interactions impact species coexistence in diverse communities.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2205063119,0
47,Higher-Order Interactions and Indirect Effects: A Resolution Using Laboratory Drosophila Communities,"The importance of higher-order interactions to community structure has been debated for decades. We attempt to resolve the conflict by placing higher-order interactions in their appropriate functional relationship with indirect effects. Indirect effects are changes in the outcome of a pairwise relationship caused by other species. These changes can be mediated through changes in species densities (altering the frequency of encounters) or through a change in the nature of the relationship itself (such as a change in the per capita competition coefficients in Lotka-Volterra models). These latter forms of indirect effects, limited by their specific mechanistic definition, are higher-order effects. They can be resolved empirically only if density effects can be accounted for, and this additional analytical requirement may explain their scarcity. We also test the competitive relationships among mycophagous drosophilids and describe an indirect effect. However, there was no evidence of a significant higher-order effect; the nonadditive effect is apparently mediated through changes in species densities. Previous laboratory studies of multispecies Drosophila communities failed to document nonadditive effects. We suggest that the multigenerational approach of earlier studies may obscure indirect effects that could be important to natural communities.",https://doi.org/10.1086/285271,0
48,Individual Behavior and Higher-Order Species Interactions,"In this article I address the manner in which ecological and developmental factors shape behaviors and the consequences of these behaviors to species interactions. An important potential consequence of adaptive behavioral responses is higher-order interactions among species (e.g., in which the presence of a third species qualitatively alters the nature of the interaction between two other species). To illustrate this potential, I examine two broad classes of adaptive behavioral responses, choice of activity level and of habitat. I review evidence that suggests that in many organisms these behaviors are mediated by trade-offs between resource acquisition and mortality risk. This trade-off provides a conceptual foundation on which to predict individual behavior, and since the trade-off changes with size, marked behavioral allometries may occur over an individual's ontogeny. I present evidence that these sorts of behavioral responses create strong higher-order interactions. I argue that theory at the individual behavioral level affords the opportunity for a rich interaction between theory at the individual and population levels by providing a mechanistic basis for species interaction theory. Because behavioral responses are occurring on the same time scale as direct effects, ecologists will need explicitly to include adaptive behavioral mechanisms in the theory to understand species interactions in many systems. Finally, I discuss how behavioral allometries may contribute to selection on features of the life cycle.",https://doi.org/10.1086/285395,0
49,Higher-order interactions shape microbial interactions as microbial community complexity increases,"Non-pairwise interactions, or higher-order interactions (HOIs), in microbial communities have been described as significant drivers of emergent features in microbiomes. Yet, the re-organization of microbial interactions between pairwise cultures and larger communities remains largely unexplored from a molecular perspective but is central to our understanding and further manipulation of microbial communities. Here, we used a bottom-up approach to investigate microbial interaction mechanisms from pairwise cultures up to 4-species communities from a simple microbiome (Hafnia alvei, Geotrichum candidum, Pencillium camemberti and Escherichia coli). Specifically, we characterized the interaction landscape for each species combination involving E. coli by identifying E. coli's interaction-associated mutants using an RB-TnSeq-based interaction assay. We observed a deep reorganization of the interaction-associated mutants, with very few 2-species interactions conserved all the way up to a 4-species community and the emergence of multiple HOIs. We further used a quantitative genetics strategy to decipher how 2-species interactions were quantitatively conserved in higher community compositions. Epistasis-based analysis revealed that, of the interactions that are conserved at all levels of complexity, 82% follow an additive pattern. Altogether, we demonstrate the complex architecture of microbial interactions even within a simple microbiome, and provide a mechanistic and molecular explanation of HOIs.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-25303-1,0
50,Beyond direct neighbourhood effects: higher-order interactions improve modelling and predicting tree survival and growth,"It is known that biotic interactions are the key to species coexistence and maintenance of species diversity. Traditional studies focus overwhelmingly on pairwise interactions between organisms, ignoring complex higher-order interactions (HOIs). In this study, we present a novel method of calculating individual-level HOIs for trees, and use this method to test the importance of size- and distance-dependent individual-level HOIs to tree performance in a 25-ha temperate forest dynamic plot. We found that full HOI-inclusive models improved our ability to model and predict the survival and growth of trees, providing empirical evidence that HOIs strongly influence tree performance in this temperate forest. Specifically, assessed HOIs mitigate the competitive direct effects of neighbours on survival and growth of focal trees. Our study lays a foundation for future investigations of the prevalence and relative importance of HOIs in global forests and their impact on species diversity.",https://doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwaa244,0
51,Controlling species densities in structurally perturbed intransitive cycles with higher-order interactions,"The persistence of biodiversity of species is a challenging proposition in ecological communities in the face of Darwinian selection. The present article investigates beyond the pairwise competitive interactions and provides a novel perspective for understanding the influence of higher-order interactions on the evolution of social phenotypes. Our simple model yields a prosperous outlook to demonstrate the impact of perturbations on intransitive competitive higher-order interactions. Using a mathematical technique, we show how alone the perturbed interaction network can quickly determine the coexistence equilibrium of competing species instead of solving a large system of ordinary differential equations. It is possible to split the system into multiple feasible cluster states depending on the number of perturbations. Our analysis also reveals that the ratio between the unperturbed and perturbed species is inversely proportional to the amount of employed perturbation. Our results suggest that nonlinear dynamical systems and interaction topologies can be interplayed to comprehend species' coexistence under adverse conditions. Particularly, our findings signify that less competition between two species increases their abundance and outperforms others.",https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0102599,0
52,Mechanisms underlying higher order interactions: from quantitative definitions to ecological processes,"Abstract When species simultaneously compete with two or more species of competitor, higher order interactions (HOIs) can lead to emergent properties not present when species interact in isolated pairs. In order to extend ecological theory to multi-competitor communities, ecologists must develop a practical and general definition for HOIs that can be applied to a wide range of competition models. In this paper we propose a definition for HOIs and outline a set of criteria for testing whether a model has or does not have HOIs. These criteria are valuable for empirical ecologists in need of clarity when discussing HOIs in empirical data. We also provide thorough discussion of how our definition compares with previous definitions of HOIs and interaction modification in the literature. In the second part of the paper we demonstrate the steps required for a rigorous test of HOIs in empirical data. To do this we simulate resource competition between three annual plant species which differ in phenology. We then fit phenomenological competition models to the outcome of simulated competition and use these to test for the presence of HOIs. In our simulations, we find the strength of HOIs varies with phenology: species that grow later experience stronger HOIs than earlier growing species. Our simulation shows how HOIs could emerge in ecosystems where resource availability and individual size change rapidly throughout the course of the growing season and where there are differences in the timing of resource acquisition between competitors.",https://doi.org/10.1101/857920,0
53,Higher-order interactions mitigate direct negative effects on population dynamics of herbaceous plants during succession,"Abstract Plant succession is regulated by a combination of abiotic and biotic factors. However, previous studies of biotic drivers have focused overwhelmingly on direct pairwise species interactions, ignoring the likely prevalent higher-order interactions (HOIs) in natural systems. Climate also plays a significant role in determining successional dynamics with both direct effects and indirect effects via altered biotic interactions. Here we explored the relative effects of direct species interactions, HOIs, climate, and their interactions on population dynamics of herbaceous plants during 50 years of post-agricultural secondary succession and tested whether the inclusion of HOIs and climate data improved forecasts of population dynamics. Direct intraspecific interactions were competitive and prevalent across the 90 herbaceous plants examined, while direct interspecific interactions only affected populations of 29% species. HOIs, mainly arose from intraspecific HOIs of conspecifics, were mostly positive and thus largely mitigated the competitive effects of direct intraspecific interactions. Species with lower peak cover experienced stronger intraspecific competition and positive intraspecific HOIs of conspecifics. Direct interspecific interactions had neutral or facilitative effects on species with lower peak cover, and tended to have competitive effects on species with higher peak cover. Climate simultaneously influenced population dynamics both directly and indirectly via altered species interactions. Forecast performance was significantly improved with the inclusion of HOIs or climate for about half and one-third of species, respectively. Our study emphasizes the importance of HOIs, which largely mitigated direct competitive effects on population dynamics of herbaceous plants during succession. Teasing apart HOIs from direct species interactions substantially refined our understanding of successional dynamics of herbaceous plants and improved the accuracy of forecasting population dynamics during succession in a changing world.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab8a88,0
54,Higher order interactions and coexistence theory,"Abstract Higher order interactions (HOIs) have been suggested to stabilize diverse ecological communities. However, their role in maintaining species coexistence from the perspective of modern coexistence theory is unknown. Here, using a three-species Lotka-Volterra model, we derive a general rule for species coexistence modulated by HOIs. We show that negative HOIs that intensify pairwise competition, can promote coexistence across a wide range of fitness differences, provided that HOIs strengthen intraspecific competition more than interspecific competition. In contrast, positive HOIs that alleviate pairwise competition can also stabilize coexistence across a wide range of fitness differences, irrespective of differences in strength of inter- and intraspecific competition. Furthermore, we extend our three-species analytical result to multispecies competitive community and show, using simulations, that feasible multispecies coexistence is possible provided that strength of negative intraspecific HOIs is higher than interspecific HOIs. In addition, multispecies communities, however, become unstable with positive HOIs as such higher-order interactions could lead to disproportionately infeasible growth rates. This work provides crucial insights on the underlying mechanisms that could maintain species diversity and links HOIs with modern coexistence theory.",https://doi.org/10.1101/748517,0
55,Advances in higher-order interactions between organisms,"It is well known that interactions between organisms are the key to species coexistence and biodiversity maintenance.Traditional studies focused overwhelmingly on direct interactions between species pairs, ignoring the more complex indirect interactions.In this review, we first distinguished two types of indirect interactions, i.e. interaction chains and higher-order interactions (HOIs).Then we reviewed the definition of higher-order interactions including the hard-HOIs and soft-HOIs, and the studies of HOIs among multiple trophic levels and within a single trophic level.In the food-web literature (among multiple trophic levels), ecologists widely studied the properties, mechanisms, pathways and experimental evidence of HOIs.Recently, there is an increasing interest in HOIs within a single trophic level.Therefore, we further introduced the significance and quantification of individual-level HOIs within a single trophic level.Not only can individual-level HOIs reconcile the hard-HOIs and soft-HOIs, but also allow us to consider variatons between individuals (e.g.individual size and spatial distribution).Finally, we proposed some promising research directions of HOIs including but not limited to: testing the prevalence and relative importance of HOIs in natural communities, exploring the mechanisms of HOIs and integrating HOIs to existing theories of community ecology.Inclusion of HOIs will help us understand the mechanisms of species coexistence and biodiversity maintenance profoundly and comprehensively, enrich and refine the theoretical framework of community ecology, and lay the foundation for biodiversity conservation and management of ecosystems in the Anthropocene.",https://doi.org/10.17520/biods.2020217,0
56,Can higher-order interactions resolve the species coexistence paradox?,"Abstract Most ecological models are based on the assumption that species interact in pairs. Emerging in diverse communities, however, are higher-order interactions, in which two or more species jointly impact the growth of a third species. A pitfall of the pairwise approach is that it misses the higher-order interactions potentially responsible for maintaining diversity in nature. Here, we explore how well higher-order interactions enable coexistence when pairwise interactions are insufficient to do so. Specifically, we explore the stability properties of systems where higher-order interactions guarantee that a specified set of abundances are a feasible equilibrium of the dynamics. Even these higher-order interactions do not necessarily produce robust coexistence. We find that facilitative higher-order interactions that counter pairwise competitive interactions are less likely to generate stable equilibria than competitive interactions countering pairwise facilitation. In both cases the system is more likely to be stable when the pairwise interactions are weak, and when the equilibrium abundances are near those produced by the pairwise interactions. Last, we show that correlations between the pairwise and higher-order interactions permit robust coexistence in diverse systems. Our work reveals the challenges in generating stable coexistence through higher-order interactions, but also uncovers higher-order interaction patterns that can enable diversity.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.19.545649,0
57,Multitrophic Higher-Order Interactions Modulate Species Persistence,"AbstractEcologists increasingly recognize that interactions between two species can be affected by the density of a third species. How these higher-order interactions (HOIs) affect species persistence remains poorly understood. To explore the effect of HOIs stemming from multiple trophic layers on a plant community composition, we experimentally built a mesocosm with three plants and three pollinator species arranged in a fully nested and modified network structure. We estimated pairwise interactions among plants and between plants and pollinators, as well as HOIs initiated by a plant or a pollinator affecting plant species pairs. Using a structuralist approach, we evaluated the consequences of the statistically supported HOIs on the persistence probability of each of the three competing plant species and their combinations. HOIs substantially redistribute the strength and sign of pairwise interactions between plant species, promoting the opportunities for multispecies communities to persist compared with a non-HOI scenario. However, the physical elimination of a plant-pollinator link in the modified network structure promotes changes in per capita pairwise interactions and HOIs, resulting in a single-species community. Our study provides empirical evidence of the joint importance of HOIs and network structure in determining species persistence within diverse communities.",https://doi.org/10.1086/729222,0

59,Higher-order interactions and emergent properties of microbial communities: The power of synthetic ecology,"Humans have long relied on microbial communities to create products, produce energy, and treat waste. The microbiota residing within our bodies directly impacts our health, while the soil and rhizosphere microbiomes influence the productivity of our crops. However, the complexity and diversity of microbial communities make them challenging to study and difficult to develop into applications, as they often exhibit the emergence of unpredictable higher-order phenomena. Synthetic ecology aims at simplifying complexity by constituting synthetic or semi-natural microbial communities with reduced diversity that become easier to study and analyze. This strategy combines methodologies that simplify existing complex systems (top-down approach) or build the system from its constituent components (bottom-up approach). Simplified communities are studied to understand how interactions among populations shape the behavior of the community and to model and predict their response to external stimuli. By harnessing the potential of synthetic microbial communities through a multidisciplinary approach, we can advance knowledge of ecological concepts and address critical public health, agricultural, and environmental issues more effectively.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e33896,0
60,Surprising effects of cascading higher order interactions,"Abstract Most species are embedded in multi-interaction networks. Consequently, theories focusing on simple pair-wise interactions cannot predict ecological and/or evolutionary outcomes. This study explores how cascading higher-order interactions (HOIs) would affect the population dynamics of a focal species. Employing a system that involves a myrmecophylic beetle, a parasitic wasp that attacks the beetle, an ant, and a parasitic fly that attacks the ant, the study explores how none, one, and two HOIs affect the parasitism and the sex ratio of the beetle. We conducted mesocosm experiments to examine these HOIs on beetle survival and sex ratio and found that the 1st degree HOI does not change the beetle’s survival rate or sex ratio. However, the 2nd degree HOI significantly reduces the beetle’s survival rate and changes its sex ratio from even to strongly female-biased. We applied Bayes’ theorem to analyze the per capita survival probability of female vs. male beetles and suggested that the unexpected results might arise from complex eco-evolutionary dynamics involved with the 1st and 2nd degree HOIs. Field data suggested the HOIs significantly regulate the sex ratio of the beetle. As the same structure of HOIs appears in other systems, we believe the complexity associated with the 2nd degree HOI would be more common than known and deserve more scientific attention.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-23763-z,0
61,The existence and strength of higher order interactions is sensitive to environmental context,"Abstract One strategy for understanding the dynamics of any complex system, such as a community of competing species, is to study the dynamics of parts of the system in isolation. Ecological communities can be decomposed into single species, and pairs of interacting species. This reductionist strategy assumes that whole‐community dynamics are predictable and explainable from knowledge of the dynamics of single species and pairs of species. This assumption will be violated if higher order interactions (HOIs) are strong. Theory predicts that HOIs should be common. But it is difficult to detect HOIs, and to infer their long‐term consequences for species coexistence, solely from short‐term data. I conducted a protist microcosm experiment to test for HOIs among competing bacterivorous ciliates, and test the sensitivity of HOIs to environmental context. I grew three competing ciliate species in all possible combinations at each of two resource enrichment levels, and used the population dynamic data from the one‐ and two‐species treatments to parameterize a competition model at each enrichment level. I then compared the predictions of the parameterized model to the dynamics of the whole community (three‐species treatment). I found that the existence, and thus strength, of HOIs was environment dependent. I found a strong HOI at low enrichment, which enabled the persistence of a species that would otherwise have been competitively excluded. At high enrichment, three‐species dynamics could be predicted from a parameterized model of one‐ and two‐species dynamics, provided that the model accounted for nonlinear intraspecific density dependence. The results provide one of the first rigorous demonstrations of the long‐term consequences of HOIs for species coexistence, and demonstrate the context dependence of HOIs. HOIs create difficult challenges for predicting and explaining species coexistence in nature.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.4156,0
62,Prophage mediated control of higher order interactions - insights from systems approaches,"Prophages, latent viral elements residing in bacterial genomes impact bacterial ecology and evolution in diverse ways. Do these prophage-mediated effects extend beyond the prophage-bacterium relationship? Here, I summarize the latest advances exploring how the impact of prophages are transmitted through multiple levels with potential impacts on ecosystem stability and functioning. The diverse effects of prophages on higher-order interactions are context-specific, ranging from contributions to global biogeochemical processes and mutualistic interactions to increased disease severity with negative impacts on ecosystem engineers and potential cascading effects for multiple species. While we have a solid understanding about the mechanisms by which prophages modulate their bacterial host at the cellular and population level, future research should take an integrative approach to quantify their effects in complex ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.32942/x2zk52,0

64,Is the addition of higher-order interactions in ecological models increasing the understanding of ecological dynamics?,"Abstract Recent work has shown that higher-order interactions can increase the stability, promote the diversity, and better explain the dynamics of ecological communities. Yet, it remains unclear whether the perceived benefits of adding higher-order terms into population dynamics models come from fundamental principles or a simple mathematical advantage given by the nature of multivariate polynomials. Here, we develop a general method to quantify the mathematical advantage of adding higher-order interactions in ecological models based on the number of free -equilibrium points that can be engineered in a system (i.e., equilibria that can be feasible or unfeasible by tunning model parameters). We apply this method to calculate the number of free-equilibrium points in Lotka-Volterra dynamics. While it is known that Lotka-Volterra models without higher-order interactions only have one free-equilibrium point regardless of the number of parameters, we find that by adding higher-order terms this number increases exponentially with the dimension of the system. Our results suggest that while adding higher-order interactions in ecological models may be good for prediction purposes, they cannot provide additional explanatory power of ecological dynamics if model parameters are not ecologically restricted.",https://doi.org/10.1101/595140,0
65,Meta-analysis of three-stressor combinations on population-level fitness reveal substantial higher-order interactions,"Although natural populations are typically subjected to multiple stressors, most past research has focused on single-stressor and two-stressor interactions, with little attention paid to higher-order interactions among three or more stressors. However, higher-order interactions increasingly appear to be widespread. Consequently, we used a recently introduced and improved framework to re-analyze higher-order ecological interactions. We conducted a literature review of the last 100 years (1920-2020) and reanalyzed 142 ecological three-stressor interactions on species' populations from 38 published papers; the vast majority of these studies were from the past 10 years. We found that 95.8 % (n = 136) of the three-stressor combinations had either not been categorized before or resulted in different interactions than previously reported. We also found substantial levels of emergent properties-interactions that are not due to strong pairwise interactions within the combination but rather uniquely due to all three stressors being combined. Calculating net interactions-the overall accounting for all possible interactions within a combination including the emergent and all pairwise interactions-we found that the most prevalent interaction type is antagonism, corresponding to a smaller than expected effect based on single stressor effects. In contrast, for emergent interactions, the most prevalent interaction type is synergistic, resulting in a larger than expected effect based on single stressor effects. Additionally, we found that hidden suppressive interactions-where a pairwise interaction is suppressed by a third stressor-are found in the majority of combinations (74 %). Collectively, understanding multiple stressor interactions through applying an appropriate framework is crucial for answering fundamental questions in ecology and has implications for conservation biology and population management. Crucially, identifying emergent properties can reveal hidden suppressive interactions that could be particularly important for the ecological management of at-risk populations.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161163,0
66,Nonlinear higher order abiotic interactions explain riverine biodiversity,"Abstract Aim Theory and experiments strongly support the importance of interactive effects of multiple factors shaping biodiversity, although their importance rarely has been investigated at biogeographically relevant scales. In particular, the importance of higher order interactions among environmental factors at such scales is largely unknown. We investigated higher order interactions of environmental factors to explain diversity patterns in a metacommunity of aquatic invertebrates at a biogeographically relevant scale and discuss the findings in an environmental management context. Location All major drainage basins in Switzerland (Rhine, Rhone, Ticino and Inn; 41,285 km 2 ). Methods Riverine α‐diversity patterns at two taxonomic levels (family richness of all benthic macroinvertebrates and species richness of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) were examined at 518 sites across the basins. We applied a novel machine learning technique to detect key three‐way interactions of explanatory variables by comparing the relative importance of 1,140 three‐way combinations for family richness and 680 three‐way combinations for species richness. Results Relatively few but important three‐way interactions were meaningful for predicting biodiversity patterns among the numerous possible combinations. Specifically, we found that interactions among elevational gradient, prevalence of forest coverage in the upstream basin and biogeoclimatic regional classification were distinctly important. Main conclusion Our results indicated that a high prevalence of terrestrial forest generally sustains riverine benthic macroinvertebrate diversity, but this relationship varies considerably with biogeoclimatic and elevational conditions likely due to community composition of forests and macroinvertebrates changing along climatic and geographical gradients. An adequate management of riverine ecosystems at relevant biogeographical scales requires the identification of such interactions and a context‐dependent implementation.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.13164,0
67,Higher-Order Interactions in Auxotroph Communities Enhance Their Resilience to Resource Fluctuations,"Auxotrophs are prevalent in microbial communities, enhancing their diversity and stability—a counterintuitive effect considering their dependence on essential resources from other species. To address the ecological roles of auxotrophs, our study introduced a novel consumer-resource model that captures the complex higher-order interactions within these communities. We also developed an intuitive graphical and algebraic framework, which assesses the feasibility of auxotroph communities and their stability under resource fluctuations and biological invasions. Validated against experimental data from synthetic E. coli auxotroph communities, the model accurately predicted outcomes of community assembly. Our findings highlight the critical role of higher-order interactions and resource dependencies in maintaining the diversity and stability of microbial ecosystems dominated by auxotrophs.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.22.595348,0
68,How combined pairwise and higher-order interactions shape transient dynamics,"Understanding how species interactions shape biodiversity is a core challenge in ecology. While much focus has been on long-term stability, there is rising interest in transient dynamics—the short-lived periods when ecosystems respond to disturbances and adjust toward stability. These transitions are crucial for predicting ecosystem reactions and guiding effective conservation. Our study introduces a model that uses convex combinations to blend pairwise and higher-order interactions (HOIs), offering a more realistic view of natural ecosystems. We find that pairwise interactions slow the journey to stability, while HOIs speed it up. Employing global stability analysis and numerical simulations, we establish that as the proportion of HOIs increases, mean transient times exhibit a significant reduction, thereby underscoring the essential role of HOIs in enhancing biodiversity stabilization. Our results reveal a robust correlation between the most negative real part of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix associated with the linearized system at the coexistence equilibrium and the mean transient times. This indicates that a more negative leading eigenvalue correlates with accelerated convergence to stable coexistence abundances. This insight is vital for comprehending ecosystem resilience and recovery, emphasizing the key role of HOIs in promoting stabilization. Amid growing interest in transient dynamics and its implications for biodiversity and ecological stability, our study enhances the understanding of how species interactions affect both transient and long-term ecosystem behavior. By addressing a critical gap in ecological theory and offering a practical framework for ecosystem management, our work advances knowledge of transient dynamics, ultimately informing effective conservation strategies.",https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0238827,0
69,The structure and dynamics of networks with higher-order interactions,"All beauty, richness and harmony in the emergent dynamics of a complex system largely depend on the specific way in which its elementary components interact. The last twenty-five years have seen the birth and development of the multidisciplinary field of Network Science, wherein a variety of distributed systems in physics, biology, social sciences and engineering have been modeled as networks of coupled units, in the attempt to unveil the mechanisms underneath their observed functionality. There is, however, a fundamental limit to such a representation: networks capture only pairwise interactions, whereas the functioning of many real-world systems not only involves dyadic connections, but rather is the outcome of collective actions at the level of groups of nodes. For instance, in ecological systems, three or more species may compete for food or territory, and similar multi-component interactions appear in functional and structural brain networks, protein interaction networks, semantic networks, multi-authors scientific collaborations, offline and online social networks, gene regulatory networks and spreading of consensus or contagious diseases due to multiple, simultaneous, contacts. Such multi-component interactions can only be grasped through either hypergraphs or simplicial complexes, which indeed have recently found a huge number of applications. In this report, we cover the extensive literature of the past years on this subject, and we focus on the structure and dynamics of hypergraphs and simplicial complexes. These are indeed becoming increasingly relevant, thanks to the enhanced resolution of data sets and the recent advances in data analysis techniques, which (concurrently and definitely) have shown that such structures play a pivotal role in the complex organization and functioning of real-world distributed systems.",https://doi.org/10.52843/cassyni.y33p9k,0

Competition models for coexistence have emphasized species-level differences in pairwise interactions, and invoked no role for intraspecific variation. These models show that stronger competitive interactions result in smaller numbers of coexisting species. However, the presence of higher-order interactions (HOIs) among species appears to have a stabilizing influence on communities. How species coexistence is affected in a community where both pairwise and higher-order interactions are pervasive is not known. Furthermore, the effect of individual variation on species coexistence in complex communities with pairwise and HOIs remains untested. Using a Lotka-Volterra model, we explore the effects of intraspecific variation on the patterns of species coexistence in a competitive community dictated by pairwise and HOIs. We found that HOIs greatly stabilize species coexistence across different levels of strength in competition. Notably, high intraspecific variation promoted species coexistence, particularly when competitive interactions were strong. However, species coexistence promoted by higher levels of variation was less robust to environmental perturbation. Additionally, species’ traits tend to cluster together when individual variation in the community increased. We argue that individual variation can promote species coexistence by reducing trait divergence and attenuating the inhibitory effects of dominant species through HOIs",https://doi.org/10.1101/494757,0
71,Multitrophic higher-order interactions modulate species persistence,"Abstract There is growing recognition that interactions between species pairs are modified in a multispecies context by the density of a third species. However, how these higher-order interactions (HOIs) affect species persistence remains poorly understood. To explore the effect of HOIs steaming from multiple trophic layers on plant persistence, we experimentally built a mutualistic system containing three plants and three pollinators species with two contrasting network structures. For both structures, we first estimated the statistically supported HOIs on plant species, in addition to the pairwise interactions among plants and plant-pollinators. Following a structuralist approach, we then assessed the effects of the supported HOIs on the persistence probability of each of the three competing plant species and their combinations. HOIs produced substantial effects on the strength and sign of per capita interactions between plant species to such an extent that predictions of species persistence differ from a non-HOIs scenario. Changes in network structure due to removing a plant-pollinator link further modulated the species persistence probabilities by reorganizing per capita interaction strengths of both pairwise interactions and HOIs. Our study provides empirical evidence of the joint importance of HOIs and network structure for determining the probability of species to persist within diverse communities.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.18.469079,0
72,Vegetation Isoline Equations with Higher Order Interaction Terms to Improve Accuracy in Retrieval of Vegetation Biophysical Parameters,"This paper introduces derivations of vegetation isoline equation mainly in red and near-infrared reflectance space to improve its accuracy for the purpose of parameter retrieval such as leaf area index and fraction of vegetation cover within a target pixel. The former isoline equations were all derived by truncating the terms of photons which went through the interactions between canopy and soil layers more than once. The improvement is achieved by accounting the terms of higher order interactions which were neglected in the former derivations. As a result, the final form of the isoline equation becomes quadratic due to the inclusions of the second order interaction term. The numerical results indicates clearly that the accuracy, defined as difference of the derived isolines from the true isolines which includes all the interaction terms, was improved significantly from the former isoline equations by adding only one more interaction term (the second order interaction) only in the near-infrared band. It is concluded that higher accuracy can be achieved by adding one more term during the derivation while retaining the final form relatively simple.",https://doi.org/10.1109/igarss.2008.4779535,0
73,General Form for Interaction Measures and Framework for Deriving Higher-Order Emergent Effects,"Interactions are ubiquitous and have been extensively studied in many ecological, evolutionary, and physiological systems. A variety of measures—ANOVA, covariance, epistatic additivity, mutual information, joint cumulants, Bliss independence—exist that compute interactions across fields. However, these are not discussed and derived within a single, general framework. This missing framework likely contributes to the confusion about proper formulations and interpretations of higher-order interactions. Intriguingly, despite higher-order interactions having received little attention, they have been recently discovered to be highly prevalent and to likely impact the dynamics of complex biological systems. Here, we introduce a single, explicit mathematical framework that simultaneously encompasses all of these measures of pairwise interactions. The generality and simplicity of this framework allows us to establish a rigorous method for deriving higher-order interaction measures based on any of the pairwise interactions listed above. These generalized higher-order interaction measures enable the exploration of emergent phenomena across systems such as multiple predator effects, gene epistasis, and environmental stressors. These results provide a mechanistic basis to better account for how interactions affect biological systems. Our theoretical advance provides a foundation for understanding multi-component interactions in complex systems such as evolving populations within ecosystems or communities.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2018.00166,0
74,"On the stability of competitive ecological communities with pairwise and
  higher-order interactions","Ecological communities intrigue researchers seeking to explain the emergence of biodiversity observed in nature. This raises a fundamental question. What sustains the stability and coexistence of species within these ecosystems? Traditional ecological models have largely been based on the assumption that species primarily engage in pairwise interactions. However, interactions in ecological systems may involve groups of three or more individuals, i.e. higher-order interactions. As a result, the question of how the combined effects of pairwise and higher-order interactions shape the stability of large ecological communities remains unresolved. This work addresses this gap by analyzing a model of competitive communities that incorporates both pairwise and higher-order interactions. Using analytical techniques and numerical simulations, we find that higher-order interactions alone are not always sufficient to foster and maintain coexistence. When species are identical (i.e., have the same physiological rates), even a small proportion of higher-order interactions can stabilize their dynamics. However, when more realistic factors, such as varied birth and death rates or complex interaction structures are introduced, a finite fraction of higher-order interactions may not be sufficient to achieve stable coexistence. Our findings challenge the role of higher-order interactions as a universal stabilizing mechanism in ecological communities and open new avenues for research into the interplay of different factors that underpin biodiversity and ecosystem stability.",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2501.09172,0
75,Structure of higher-order interactions in social-ecological networks through Q-analysis of their neighbourhood and clique complex,"This paper studies higher-order interactions in social-ecological networks, which formally represent interactions within the social and ecological units of an ecosystem. Many real-world social ecosystems exhibit not only pairwise interactions but also higher-order interactions among their units. Therefore, the conventional graph-theoretic description of networks falls short of capturing these higher-order interactions due to the inherent limitations of the graph definition. In this work, a mathematical framework for capturing the higher-order interactions of a social-ecological system has been given by incorporating notions from combinatorial algebraic topology. In order to achieve this, two different simplicial complexes, the clique and the neighbourhood complex, have been constructed from a pairwise social-ecological network. As a case study, the Q-analysis and a structural study of the interactions in the rural agricultural system of southern Madagascar have been done at various structural levels denoted by q . The results obtained by calculating all the structural vectors for both simplicial complexes, along with exciting results about the participation of facets of the clique complex at different q -levels, have been discussed. This work also establishes significant theorems concerning the dimension of the neighbourhood complex and clique complex obtained from the parent pairwise network.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0306409,0
76,Evolutionary effects of individual variation and dimensionality of higher-order interactions on robustness of species coexistence,"Abstract Although the eco-evolutionary effects of individual variation for species coexistence are still widely debated, theoretical evidence appears to support a negative impact on coexistence. Mechanistic models of eco-evolutionary effects of individual variation focus largely on pairwise interactions, while the dynamics of communities where both pairwise and higher-order interactions (HOIs) are pervasive are not known. In addition, most studies have focused on effects of high dimensional HOIs on species coexistence when in reality such HOIs could be highly structured and low-dimensional, as species interactions could primarily be mediated through phenotypic traits. Here, combining quantitative genetics and Lotka-Volterra equations, we explored the eco-evolutionary effects of individual variation on the patterns of species coexistence in a competitive community dictated by pairwise interactions and HOIs. Specifically, we compare six different models in which HOIs were modelled to be trait-mediated (low-dimensional) or random (high-dimensional) and evaluated its impact on robustness of species coexistence in the presence of different levels of individual variation. Across the six different models, we found that individual variation did not promote species coexistence, irrespective of whether interactions were pairwise or were of higher-order. However, individual trait variation could stabilize communities to external perturbation more so when interactions were of higher order. When compared across models, species coexistence is promoted when HOIs strengthen pairwise intraspecific competition more so than interspecific competition, and when HOIs act in a hierarchical manner. Additionally, across the models, we found that species’ traits tend to cluster together when individual variation in the community was low. We argue that, while individual variation can influence community patterns in many different ways, they more often lead to fewer species coexisting together.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.22.521465,0
77,"Higher-order effects, continuous species interactions, and trait evolution shape microbial spatial dynamics","The assembly and maintenance of microbial diversity in natural communities, despite the abundance of toxin-based antagonistic interactions, presents major challenges for biological understanding. A common framework for investigating such antagonistic interactions involves cyclic dominance games with pairwise interactions. The incorporation of higher-order interactions in such models permits increased levels of microbial diversity, especially in communities in which antibiotic-producing, sensitive, and resistant strains coexist. However, most such models involve a small number of discrete species, assume a notion of pure cyclic dominance, and focus on low mutation rate regimes, none of which well represent the highly interlinked, quickly evolving, and continuous nature of microbial phenotypic space. Here, we present an alternative vision of spatial dynamics for microbial communities based on antagonistic interactions-one in which a large number of species interact in continuous phenotypic space, are capable of rapid mutation, and engage in both direct and higher-order interactions mediated by production of and resistance to antibiotics. Focusing on toxin production, vulnerability, and inhibition among species, we observe highly divergent patterns of diversity and spatial community dynamics. We find that species interaction constraints (rather than mobility) best predict spatiotemporal disturbance regimes, whereas community formation time, mobility, and mutation size best explain patterns of diversity. We also report an intriguing relationship among community formation time, spatial disturbance regimes, and diversity dynamics. This relationship, which suggests that both higher-order interactions and rapid evolution are critical for the origin and maintenance of microbial diversity, has broad-ranging links to the maintenance of diversity in other systems.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2020956119,0

We also found substantial levels of emergent properties—interactions that are only revealed when all three stressors are present.

81,Surprising effects of cascading higher order interactions,"Abstract Most species are embedded in multi-interaction networks. Consequently, theories focusing on simple pair-wise interactions cannot predict ecological and/or evolutionary outcomes. This study explores how cascading higher-order interactions (HOIs) would affect the population dynamics of a focal species. Employing a system that involves a myrmecophylic beetle, a parasitic wasp that attacks the beetle, an ant, and a parasitic fly that attacks the ant, the study explores how none, one, and two HOIs affect the parasitism and the sex ratio of the beetle. We conducted mesocosm experiments to examine these HOIs on beetle survival and sex ratio and found that the 1st degree HOI does not change the beetle’s survival rate or sex ratio. However, the 2nd degree HOI significantly reduces the beetle’s survival rate and changes its sex ratio from even to strongly female-biased. We applied Bayes’ theorem to analyze the per capita survival probability of female vs. male beetles and suggested that the unexpected results might arise from complex eco-evolutionary dynamics involved with the 1st and 2nd degree HOIs. Field data suggested the HOIs significantly regulate the sex ratio of the beetle. As the same structure of HOIs appears in other systems, we believe the complexity associated with the 2nd degree HOI would be more common than known and deserve more scientific attention.",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1926117/v1,0

83,The impact of structured higher-order interactions on ecological network stability,"Abstract The impact of higher-order interactions, those involving more than two species, is increasingly appreciated as having the potential to strongly influence the dynamics of complex ecological systems. However, although the critical importance of the structure of pairwise interaction networks is well established, studies of higher-order interactions still largely assume random structures. Here, we demonstrate the strong impact of structured higher-order interactions on simulated ecological communities. We focus on effects caused by interaction modifications within food webs, where a consumer resource interaction is modified by a third species, and for which plausible structures can be hypothesised. We show how interaction modifications introduced under a range of non-random distributions may impact the overall network structure. Local stability and the size of the feasibility domain are critically dependent on the inter-relationship between trophic and non-trophic effects. Where interaction modifications are structured into mutual interference motifs (associated with consumers switching between resources) synergistic signs and topological effects have particularly consequential impacts. Furthermore, we show that previous results of the impact of higher-order interactions on diversity-stability relationships can be reversed when higher-order interactions are structured, not random. Empirical data on interaction modifications will be a key part of improving understanding the dynamics of communities, particularly the distribution of interaction modification signs across networks.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12080-025-00603-0,0

Here we present a novel investigation on the effect of the onset speed of a higher-order interaction. In particular, we study the stability of the equilibrium of all configurations of a three-species interaction network, including transitive as well as intransitive ones. We show that the HOI onset speed has a dramatic effect on the evolution and stability of the ecological network, with significant structural changes compared to commonly used HOI extensions or pairwise networks. Changes in the HOI onset speed from fast to slow can reverse the stability of the interaction network. The evolution of the system also affects the equilibrium that will be reached, influenced by the HOI onset speed.

90,"How Combined Pairwise and Higher-Order Interactions Shape Transient
  Dynamics","Understanding how species interactions shape biodiversity is a core challenge in ecology. While much focus has been on long-term stability, there is rising interest in transient dynamics-the short-lived periods when ecosystems respond to disturbances and adjust toward stability. These transitions are crucial for predicting ecosystem reactions and guiding effective conservation. Our study introduces a model that uses convex combinations to blend pairwise and higher-order interactions, offering a more realistic view of natural ecosystems. We find pairwise interactions slow the journey to stability, while higher-order interactions speed it up. Employing global stability analysis and numerical simulations, we establish that as the proportion of higher-order interactions (HOIs) increases, mean transient times exhibit a significant reduction, thereby underscoring the essential role of HOIs in enhancing biodiversity stabilization. Our results reveal a robust correlation between the most negative real part of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix associated with the linearized system at the coexistence equilibrium and the mean transient times. This indicates that a more negative leading eigenvalue correlates with accelerated convergence to stable coexistence abundances. This insight is vital for comprehending ecosystem resilience and recovery, emphasizing the key role of HOIs in promoting stabilization. Amid growing interest in transient dynamics and its implications for biodiversity and ecological stability, our study enhances the understanding of how species interactions affect both transient and long-term ecosystem behavior. By addressing a critical gap in ecological theory and offering a practical framework for ecosystem management, our work advances knowledge of transient dynamics, ultimately informing effective conservation strategies.",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2409.09521,0
91,Direct and higher-order interactions in plant communities under increasing weather persistence,"Climate change is increasing the weather persistence in the mid-latitudes, prolonging both dry and wet spells compared to historic averages. These newly emerging environmental conditions destabilize plant communities, but the role of species interactions in this process is unknown. Here, we tested how direct and higher-order interactions (HOIs) between species may change in synthesized grassland communities along an experimental gradient of increasing persistence in precipitation regimes. Our results indicate that species interactions (including HOIs) are an important determinant of plant performance under increasing weather persistence. Out of the 12 most parsimonious models predicting species productivity, 75 % contained significant direct interactions and 92 % significant HOIs. Inclusion of direct interactions or HOIs respectively tripled or quadrupled the explained variance of target species biomass compared to null models only including the precipitation treatment. Drought dominated the plant responses, with longer droughts increasing direct competition but also HOI-driven facilitation. Despite these counteracting changes, drought intensified net competition. Grasses were generally more involved in competitive interactions whereas legumes had a stronger affinity for facilitative interactions. Under longer drought, species affinity for nutrient rich or wet environments resulted in more negative direct interactions or HOIs, respectively. We conclude that higher-order interactions, crucially depending on species identity, only partially stabilize community dynamics under increasing weather persistence.",https://doi.org/10.22541/au.168013272.22178343/v1,0
92,Connecting higher order interactions with ecological stability in experimental aquatic food webs,"Abstract Community ecology is built on theories that represent the strength of interactions between species as pairwise links. Higher order interactions occur when the presence of a third (or more) species changes the pairwise interaction between a focal pair. Recent theoretical work has highlighted the stabilizing role of higher order interactions for large, simulated communities, yet it remains unclear how important higher order effects are in real communities. Here we used experimental communities of aquatic protists to examine the relationship between higher-order interactions and community stability (as measured by the persistence of species in a community). We cultured a focal pair of consumers in the presence of additional competitors and a predator and collected time series data of their abundances. We then fitted competition models with and without HOIs to measure interaction strength between the focal pair across different community compositions. We used survival analysis to measure the persistence of individual species. We found evidence that additional species positively affected persistence of the focal species and that HOIs were present in most of our communities. However, persistence was only linked to HOIs for one of the focal species. Our results vindicate community ecology theory positing that species interactions may deviate from assumptions of pairwise interactions, opening avenues to consider possible consequences for coexistence and community stability.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.04.539390,0
93,Controlling species densities in structurally perturbed intransitive cycles with higher-order interactions,"The persistence of biodiversity of species is a challenging proposition in ecological communities in the face of Darwinian selection. The present article investigates beyond the pairwise competitive interactions and provides a novel perspective for understanding the influence of higher-order interactions on the evolution of social phenotypes. Our simple model yields a prosperous outlook to demonstrate the impact of perturbations on intransitive competitive higher-order interactions. Using a mathematical technique, we show how alone the perturbed interaction network can quickly determine the coexistence equilibrium of competing species instead of solving a large system of ordinary differential equations. It is possible to split the system into multiple feasible cluster states depending on the number of perturbations. Our analysis also reveals the ratio between the unperturbed and perturbed species is inversely proportional to the amount of employed perturbation. Our results suggest that nonlinear dynamical systems and interaction topologies can be interplayed to comprehend species' coexistence under adverse conditions. Particularly our findings signify that less competition between two species increases their abundance and outperforms others.",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2208.10108,0

However, higher-order interactions (HOIs), i.e., the ones that manifest only in triplets, quadruplets, etc., could have important effects on network activities but have not been fully examined at the macroscopic level. Specifically, the relation between HOIs and the global signal (GS), which reflects the common fluctuations among all brain areas, remains unclear. To address these issues, here we first characterized HOIs in macroscopic functional networks based on resting state (rs) fMRI data with and without global signal regression (GSR), and then studied the relation between HOIs and GS, as well as other possible mechanism that can give rise to HOIs, by simulating BOLD signals in distributed brain networks. Methods: The data set is the first and second scanning of 100 subjects in HCP Q3 (TR=720ms, 1200 frames in each scanning). In total, 226,000 frames (about 48 hours) of imaging data were used. Standard preprocessing was applied, including head motion correction, 0.01-0.1Hz filtering and regressing movement. Simulated BOLD signals were generated by combining a mean-field network model with the Balloon-Windkessel hemodynamic model (Deco et al. 2013). To quantify network activities and the strength of HOIs, we used a threshold for individual ROIs and then converted the original signals into binary time series, based on if the amplitude is above the threshold or not. Results: We analyzed activities of the Fronto-Parietal Network (FPN, 11 ROIs) and the Default Mode Network (DMN, 12 ROIs). To measure the effect of HOIs on network activities, we separately applied a pair-wise model (Ising model, Schneidman et al. 2006) and a model with thresholding-induced HOIs (DG model, Macke et al. 2009; Yu et al. 2011) to the data. We use the Jensen–Shannon (JS) divergence to estimate the accuracy of the two models. For GSR data, we found that, consistent with a recent study under GSR condition (Watanabe et al., 2013), the Ising model gave reasonably accurate description of probability distributions of network states, and its JS divergence was slightly larger than that of the DG model (less than 1.5 times for both networks), implying weak HOIs in the data; However, for data without GSR, the Ising model became much worse (with 2.5~4 times larger JS divergence) than the DG model, suggesting a stronger effect of HOIs in such condition. Importantly, the DG model’s performance was the same for data with and without GSR, indicating that the increased HOIs with GS can be explained as a thresholding-induced effect, rather than an intrinsic feature of brain activities. Next we tried to understand these empirical results by simulating both neuronal activities and BOLD signals in a network model with excitatory coupling between brain areas, in which the strengths of common input and pair-wise coupling were changed systemically. We found that, in both neuronal and BOLD signals, strong common input, which serves as a source for the global signal, led to significant HOIs. Consistent with our empirical results, such HOIs could also be explained by the DG model. In addition, we found that the coupling strength has very little effect on the strength of HOIs in the network. These results shed new light on understanding both weak HOIs in data with GSR and apparently strong HOIs in data without GSR. Conclusion: We found that, although there are sizable HOIs in brain’s functional networks in data without GSR, they are mainly due to the thresholding operation introduced in the data analysis. The true, intrinsic HOIs in BOLD signals are therefore weak regardless of GSR. This warrants the use of methods based on pair-wise interactions in studying functional networks. We also found that such lack of intrinsic HOIs may be resulted from the fact that brain areas usually interact with each other via pair-wise, excitatory connections, suggesting that the lack of intrinsic HOIs may be a generic property of such networks.

95,Higher-order interactions among coinfecting parasites and a microbial mutualist impact disease progression,"Abstract Interactions among parasites and other microbes within hosts can impact disease progression, yet study of such interactions has been mostly limited to pairwise combinations of microbes. Given the diversity of microbes within hosts, higher-order interactions among more than two microbial species may also impact disease. To test this hypothesis, we performed inoculation experiments that investigated interactions among two fungal parasites, Rhizoctonia solani and Colletotrichum cereale , and a systemic fungal endophyte, Epichloë coenophiala , within a grass host. Both pairwise and higher-order interactions impacted disease progression. While the endophyte did not directly influence R. solani growth or C. cereale symptom development, the endophyte modified the interaction between the two parasites. The magnitude of the facilitative effect of C. cereale on the growth of R. solani tended to be greater when the endophyte was present. Moreover, this interaction modification strongly affected leaf mortality. For plants lacking the endophyte, parasite co-inoculation did not increase leaf mortality compared to single-parasite inoculations. In contrast, for endophyte-infected plants, parasite co-inoculation increased leaf mortality compared to inoculation with R. solani or C. cereale alone by 1.9 or 4.9 times, respectively. Together, these results show that disease progression can be strongly impacted by higher-order interactions among microbial symbionts.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.25.437101,0
96,Faculty Opinions recommendation of The mechanistic basis for higher-order interactions and non-additivity in competitive communities.,"Motivated by both analytical tractability and empirical practicality, community ecologists have long treated the species pair as the fundamental unit of study. This notwithstanding, the challenge of understanding more complex systems has repeatedly generated interest in the role of so-called higher-order interactions (HOIs) imposed by species beyond the focal pair. Here we argue that HOIs - defined as non-additive effects of density on per capita growth - are best interpreted as emergent properties of phenomenological models (e.g. Lotka-Volterra competition) rather than as distinct 'ecological processes' in their own right. Using simulations of consumer-resource models, we explore the mechanisms and system properties that give rise to HOIs in observational data. We demonstrate that HOIs emerge under all but the most restrictive of assumptions, and that incorporating non-additivity into phenomenological models improves the quantitative and qualitative accuracy of model predictions. Notably, we also observe that HOIs derive primarily from mechanisms and system properties that apply equally to single-species or pairwise systems as they do to more diverse communities. Consequently, there exists a strong mandate for further recognition of non-additive effects in both theoretical and empirical research.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.

97,Data from: Direct and higher-order interactions in plant communities under increasing weather persistence,"ABSTRACT: Climate change is increasing the weather persistence in the midlatitudes, prolonging both dry and wet spells compared to historic averages. These newly emerging environmental conditions destabilize plant communities, but the role of species interactions in this process is unknown. Here, we tested how direct and higher-order interactions (HOIs) between species may change in synthesized grassland communities along an experimental gradient of increasing persistence in precipitation regimes. Our results indicate that species interactions (including HOIs) are an important determinant of plant performance under increasing weather persistence. Out of the 12 most parsimonious models predicting species productivity, 75 % contained significant direct interactions and 92 % significant HOIs. Inclusion of direct interactions or HOIs respectively tripled or quadrupled the explained variance of target species biomass compared to null models only including the precipitation treatment. Drought dominated the plant responses, with longer droughts increasing direct competition but also HOI-driven facilitation. Despite these counteracting changes, drought intensified net competition. Grasses were generally more involved in competitive interactions whereas legumes had a stronger affinity for facilitative interactions. Under longer drought, species affinity for nutrient rich or wet environments resulted in more negative direct interactions or HOIs, respectively. We conclude that higher-order interactions, crucially depending on species identity, only partially stabilize community dynamics under increasing weather persistence",https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10167759,0

99,VERTEBRATES: INTERACTION STRENGTH AND HIGHER ORDER INTERACTIONS1,"Replicated experiments in artificial ponds demonstrated that an assemblage of aquatic insects competed with tadpoles of the frogs Hyla andersonii and Bufo woodhousei fowleri. We independently manipulated the presence or absence of aquatic insects, and the abundance of an anuran competitor (0 or 150 Bufo w. fowleri per experimental pond), using a completely crossed design for two-factor variance analysis, and observed the responses of initially similar cohorts of Hyla andersonii tadpoles to neither, either, or both insect and anuran competitors. Insects and Bufo significantly depressed the mean individual mass at metamorphosis of Hyla froglets and the cumulative biomass of anurans leaving the ponds at metamor- phosis. Neither insects nor Bufo affected the survival or larval period of Hyla. Insects also significantly reduced the mean mass of Bufo, showing that both anurans responded to competition from insects. The intensity of competition between natural densities of insects and Hyla tadpoles was comparable to the intensity of competition between Bufo and Hyla, at a density of 150 Bufo/1000 L.",,0

Despite being the most numerous input source and output target of the cortex, the relation of thalamus to synchronized cortical activity is not yet fully established. Thalamic nuclei differ in their connectivity; first order (FO) thalamic nuclei receive driving inputs from various subcortical centers whereas higher order (HO) nuclei are contacted by driving afferents arising from cortical layer V. Besides, all thalamic nuclei receive strong modulatory input from cortical layer VI. To investigate thalamocortical synchrony, we performed simultaneous multiple single-unit recordings in rats under urethane anesthesia in the somatosensory FO ventral postero-medial nucleus (VPM), the HO nucleus posterior (Po) and in the S1 cortex. The recordings were made using four-shank silicon probes, which could span different nuclei. The exact electrode position was determined by pre-labeling the probes with DiI. In Po, thalamic relay activity showed up-and down states, with majority of cells firing phase locked to cortical activity. In VPM, however, thalamic firing was weakly coupled to cortical up- and down states. Instead, the activity was dominated by local spindles, which were frequently restricted to one or two electrode shanks, and only occasionally spread to the neocortex. In the VPM another type of unit was also recorded with narrower spike waveforms, longer burst duration, and higher activity during spindles. These features indicate that they can potentially be the axon terminals of reticular thalamic neuron Relay cells and putative nRt terminals fired at different phases of spindle oscillations, with relay cells preceding nRt terminals. Our data demonstrate distinct population activity in first order, higher order and reticular thalamic nuclei. Conference: IBRO International Workshop 2010, Pécs, Hungary, 21 Jan - 23 Jan, 2010.

102,The role of higher-order biotic interactions on tropical tree growth,"Growth in individual size or biomass is a key demographic component in population models, with wide-ranging applications from quantifying species performance across abiotic or biotic conditions to assessing landscape-level dynamics under global change. In forest ecology, the responses of tree growth to biotic interactions are widely held to be crucial for understanding forest diversity, function, and structure. To date, most studies on plant--plant interaction only examine the direct competitive or facilitative interactions between species pairs; however, there is increasing evidence of indirect, higher-order interactions (HOIs) impacting species demographic rates. When HOIs are present, the dynamics of a multi-species community cannot be fully understood or accurately predicted solely from pairwise outcomes because of how additional species interfere with the direct, pairwise interactions. Such HOIs should be particularly prevalent where species show nonlinear functional responses to resource availability and resource-acquisition traits themselves are density dependent. With this in mind, we used data from a tropical secondary forest---a system that fulfills both of these conditions---to build a ontogenetic diameter-growth model for individuals across ten woody-plant species. We allowed both direct and indirect interactions within communities to influence the species-specific growth parameters in a generalized Lotka--Volterra model. Specifically, indirect interactions entered the model as higher-order quadratic terms, i.e. non-additive effects of conspecific and heterospecific neighbour size on the focal individual9s growth. For the whole community and for four out of ten focal species, the model that included HOIs had more statistical support than the model that included only direct interactions, despite the former containing a far greater number of parameters. HOIs had comparable effect sizes to direct interactions, and tend to further reduce the diameter growth rates of most species beyond what direct interactions had already reduced. In a simulation of successional stand dynamics, we show that such a further reduction in diameter growth by HOIs is important in reducing size asymmetry---and potentially less competitive exclusion due to shading---in a highly light-competitive forest. Our study highlights the potential role of higher-order interactions in stabilising communities in diverse forests.",,0
103,"Exploring higher-order neural network node interactions with total
  correlation","In domains such as ecological systems, collaborations, and the human brain the variables interact in complex ways. Yet accurately characterizing higher-order variable interactions (HOIs) is a difficult problem that is further exacerbated when the HOIs change across the data. To solve this problem we propose a new method called Local Correlation Explanation (CorEx) to capture HOIs at a local scale by first clustering data points based on their proximity on the data manifold. We then use a multivariate version of the mutual information called the total correlation, to construct a latent factor representation of the data within each cluster to learn the local HOIs. We use Local CorEx to explore HOIs in synthetic and real world data to extract hidden insights about the data structure. Lastly, we demonstrate Local CorEx's suitability to explore and interpret the inner workings of trained neural networks.",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2402.04440,0
104,From basic to higher-order relational processes: Concepts of human-environment interactions among the Shuar,"This thesis uses a biosocial anthropological approach to explore the wide variety of human-environmental interactions exhibited by the Shuar of the Ecuadorian Amazon. Based on 10 months of ethnographic inquiry and deploying a comparative and evolutionary perspective, this thesis focuses primarily on the holistic nature of ancient subsistence patterns. I delve into the adaptive strategies exhibited by the contemporary Shuar and attempt to delineate the socio-ecological, ritual and cosmological significance of these patterns of behaviour. I suggest how subsistence adaptations, like hunting, which have been greatly diminished in the Shuar communities, nevertheless reveal particular forms of cross-species interactions likely deeply rooted in coevolutionary processes. As clearly indicated by informants' oral histories, hunting patterns and meat-eating behaviour show complex trophic, socio-structural and ritual associations between humans and animal taxa. I then hypothesise that food taboos against eating particular animals (mostly large mammals) may have functioned as mechanisms for the preservation of prey and likely arose from ancient relationships with extinct megafauna. Further, concerning horticulture, a subsistence strategy still practised by the Shuar, I reveal how specific forms of human-plant interactions, such as those with Manihot esculenta Crantz and Guadua spp., inform patterns of patterns of growth, fertility and reproduction. This Amazonian form of human-plant coevolution exhibited by traditional horticulture underscores, in principle, basic and higher-order relational processes exemplified by the biosocial, ritual, ontological, and myth-cosmological associations between organismic kingdoms. Concerning the use of medicinal and psychoactive plants, I show how these kinds of botanical knowledge frequently intersect, thus representing adaptive behaviours highly dependent on embodied and cognitive engagements with plant materials. Both conceived as elementary forms of cure and primary triggers of metaphysical formulations, relationships with these elements of the plant kingdom are likely to be well-embedded in our evolutionary history. Lastly, the thesis' attempt at cross-species comparisons linked to different evolutionary periods (i.e., archaic hominins, extant forager-horticulturalists and non-human primates) may shed new light on the nature of complex adaptive patterns exhibited by Indigenous peoples in general and the Shuar in particular.",https://doi.org/10.31237/osf.io/g28hp_v1,0
105,"Higher-order effects, continuous species interactions, and trait evolution shape microbial spatial dynamics","Abstract The assembly and maintenance of microbial diversity in natural communities, despite the abundance of toxin-based antagonistic interactions, presents major challenges for biological understanding. A common framework for investigating such antagonistic interactions involve cyclic dominance games with pairwise interactions. The incorporation of higher-order interactions in such models permits increased levels of microbial diversity, especially in communities where antibiotic producing, sensitive, and resistant strains co-exist. However, most such models involve a small number of discrete species, assume a notion of pure cyclic dominance, and focus on low mutation rate regimes, none of which well represents the highly interlinked, quickly evolving, and continuous nature of microbial phenotypic space. Here, we present an alternative vision of spatial dynamics for microbial communities based on antagonistic interactions—one in which a large number of species interact in continuous phenotypic space, are capable of rapid mutation, and engage in both direct and higher-order interactions mediated by production of and resistance to antibiotics. Focusing on toxin production, vulnerability, and inhibition among species, we observe highly divergent patterns of diversity and spatial community dynamics. We find that species interaction constraints (rather than mobility) best predict spatiotemporal disturbance regimes, whereas community formation time, mobility, and mutation size best explain patterns of diversity. We also report an intriguing relationship among community formation time, spatial disturbance regimes, and diversity dynamics. This relationship, which suggests that both higher-order interactions and rapid evolution are critical for the origin and maintenance of microbial diversity, has broad-ranging links to the maintenance of diversity in other systems. Significance Statement Persistently diverse microbial communities are one of biology’s great puzzles. Using a novel continuous trait space modeling framework that accommodates high mutation rates, elevated species richness, and direct and higher-order antagonistic species interactions, we find that two parameters characterizing mutation size and mobility best explain patterns of microbial diversity. Moreover, community formation time (the duration of the transient phase in community assembly) provides an unexpectedly clear guide to the diversity profiles of the resulting communities. These discoveries showcase how complex, antagonistic interactions mediated by the production of, inhibition of, and vulnerability to toxins (antibiotics) can shape microbial communities, allowing for extraordinarily high levels of diversity and temporal persistence.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.02.429382,0

107,"Editorial: Intermolecular interaction studies in binary and higher order liquid mixtures, ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents based systems","mixture especially those comprising Ionic Liquids (ILs) and Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES) are crucial for understanding their behavior in various industrial and scientific applications.Understanding the thermophysical properties and the nature of these intermolecular interactions is essential for optimizing the use of this binary and multicomponent mixture and consequently the usage of sustainable and greener alternative in various applications in the form of ILs and DESs, including drug delivery systems, solvent recovery processes, etc. while ensuring improved efficiency, safety, and performance in practical implementations. As of today, there are more than approximately 500 commercially available Room temperature Ionic Liquids (RTILs) with multifarious commercial and industrial applications and are used in diverse processes viz., solvent extraction [ https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jics.2025.101638] , separations, heat-mass transfer, process design etc. Thorough knowledge of the thermophysical properties of the ionic liquids and their phase behaviour with solids, liquids and gases opens up newer pathways for designing ""tailormade"" ionic liquids which can be fine-tuned to carry out very specific technical applications as a designer solvent. The high thermal stability, very low vapour pressure, adjustable viscosity and water miscibility make them ideally suited environmentally benign alternatives as compared to conventional organic solvents and thereby can be termed as Green Solvents.Deep Eutectic solvents represent the emerging ""New Age Green Solvents"", owing to their very low melting points depression in the eutectic region. They are slowly gaining ground as the alternatives to the Ionic Liquids owing to their specific characteristics of being safer This Special Issue of Frontiers aims to bring forth these aspects to make it interesting for a diverse scientific community.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fchem.2025.1577620,0
108,"The evolution, maintenance and adaptive function of genetic colour polymorphism in birds","The hypothesis that ornaments can honestly signal quality only if their expression is condition-dependent has dominated the study of the evolution and function of colour traits. Much less interest has been devoted to the adaptive function of colour traits for which the expression is not, or is to a low extent, sensitive to body condition and the environment in which individuals live. The aim of the present paper is to review the current theoretical and empirical knowledge of the evolution, maintenance and adaptive function of colour plumage traits for which the expression is mainly under genetic control. The finding that in many bird species the inheritance of colour morphs follows the laws of Mendel indicates that genetic colour polymorphism is frequent. Polymorphism may have evolved or be maintained because each colour morph facilitates the exploitation of alternative ecological niches as suggested by the observation that individuals are not randomly distributed among habitats with respect to coloration. Consistent with the hypothesis that different colour morphs are linked to alternative strategies is the finding that in a majority of species polymorphism is associated with reproductive parameters, and behavioural, life-history and physiological traits. Experimental studies showed that such covariations can have a genetic basis. These observations suggest that colour polymorphism has an adaptive function. Aviary and field experiments demonstrated that colour polymorphism is used as a criterion in mate-choice decisions and dominance interactions confirming the claim that conspecifics assess each other's colour morphs. The factors favouring the evolution and maintenance of genetic variation in coloration are reviewed, but empirical data are virtually lacking to assess their importance. Although current theory predicts that only condition-dependent traits can signal quality, the present review shows that genetically inherited morphs can reveal the same qualities. The study of genetic colour polymorphism will provide important and original insights on the adaptive function of conspicuous traits.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s1464793104006487,0
109,"A Widespread Chromosomal Inversion Polymorphism Contributes to a Major Life-History Transition, Local Adaptation, and Reproductive Isolation","The role of chromosomal inversions in adaptation and speciation is controversial. Historically, inversions were thought to contribute to these processes either by directly causing hybrid sterility or by facilitating the maintenance of co-adapted gene complexes. Because inversions suppress recombination when heterozygous, a recently proposed local adaptation mechanism predicts that they will spread if they capture alleles at multiple loci involved in divergent adaptation to contrasting environments. Many empirical studies have found inversion polymorphisms linked to putatively adaptive phenotypes or distributed along environmental clines. However, direct involvement of an inversion in local adaptation and consequent ecological reproductive isolation has not to our knowledge been demonstrated in nature. In this study, we discovered that a chromosomal inversion polymorphism is geographically widespread, and we test the extent to which it contributes to adaptation and reproductive isolation under natural field conditions. Replicated crosses between the prezygotically reproductively isolated annual and perennial ecotypes of the yellow monkeyflower, Mimulus guttatus, revealed that alternative chromosomal inversion arrangements are associated with life-history divergence over thousands of kilometers across North America. The inversion polymorphism affected adaptive flowering time divergence and other morphological traits in all replicated crosses between four pairs of annual and perennial populations. To determine if the inversion contributes to adaptation and reproductive isolation in natural populations, we conducted a novel reciprocal transplant experiment involving outbred lines, where alternative arrangements of the inversion were reciprocally introgressed into the genetic backgrounds of each ecotype. Our results demonstrate for the first time in nature the contribution of an inversion to adaptation, an annual/perennial life-history shift, and multiple reproductive isolating barriers. These results are consistent with the local adaptation mechanism being responsible for the distribution of the two inversion arrangements across the geographic range of M. guttatus and that locally adaptive inversion effects contribute directly to reproductive isolation. Such a mechanism may be partially responsible for the observation that closely related species often differ by multiple chromosomal rearrangements.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000500,0
110,A review of colour and pattern polymorphisms in anurans,"Species that exhibit polymorphism, the simultaneous occurrence of two or more discrete, genetically-based phenotypes in a population, are ideal for studying the microevolutionary forces that maintain genetic variation in nature. Many anuran species exhibit striking colour or dorsal pattern polymorphisms, and so provide an excellent system in which to study questions pertaining to the evolution and maintenance of polymorphisms. Despite the wide occurrence of pattern or colour polymorphisms in anurans (current records cite at least 225 species representing 35 genera and 11 families) surprisingly little conclusive work has been done on the inheritance and selective maintenance of this variation. The mode of inheritance has been investigated in 26 species, but conclusively demonstrated in only two. Forty-six species have been described as undergoing ontogenetic change, and 32 species have been described as sexually dimorphic. That anuran polymorphisms are under some sort of selection has been inferred from the large number of polymorphic species, from putative cases of apparent convergent evolution and the existence of identical polymorphisms in closely related species, from cyclical fluctuations in morph frequencies, and from a few observations of non-random survival during bouts of stress. The selective mechanisms maintaining these polymorphisms have been investigated in only 19 species. Most studies looked for physiological traits correlated with the polymorphism, rather than studying the most obvious mechanism, selective predation on colour/pattern itself. Thus, anuran polymorphisms remain a rich but largely unexploited system for studying the evolution of phenotypic variation in nature. There are at least 225 species representing 35 genera and 11 families of anurans that exhibit a colour or pattern polymorphism. These include several apparent cases of parallel polymorphism or convergent evolution. This diversity provides an excellent system in which to study polymorphism. The mode of inheritance has been investigated in 26 species. Although most studies indicate that CP is highly heritable, simple Mendelian inheritance has been conclusively demonstrated for CP polymorphisms in only two species (not counting albinos and other variants that are too rare to qualify as polymorphisms). There is an obvious need for more genetic studies. Forty-six species have been described as undergoing ontogenetic change, and 32 have been described as sexually dimorphic. An interesting area of research would be on the adaptive benefits of ontogenetic change, and on why anurans are sexually dimorphic. That anuran CP polymorphisms are under some sort of selection has been inferred by the large number of polymorphic species, the occurrence of apparent convergent evolution and the existence of identical polymorphisms in closely related species, the observation of consistent cyclical fluctuation in frequencies of morphs over short (seasonal) or long (annual) periods of time, and a few fortuitous cases of non-random survival (A. crepitans, and R. pipiens). The mechanisms behind the selective maintenance of colour and/or pattern polymorphism have been investigated in 19 species. Most of these studies attempted to determine if some fitness-related trait was correlated with morph type, and were mostly inconclusive. Although only four studies investigated direct selection by predators on CP polymorphism itself, two of these demonstrated differential selection (albeit in the laboratory). We believe that the simplest explanation for the maintenance of CP polymorphisms is indeed direct selection by visually-oriented predators. Well-designed studies are needed on the effects of predation on morph frequencies in the field. Although such studies are difficult to conduct, they are likely to be much more fruitful than yet more searching for correlated physiological traits. This remains a wide open and potentially rewarding area of study.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2000.tb00221.x,0
111,Origin of the genic diversity of cultivated rice (Oryza spp.): study of the polymorphism scored at 40 isozyme loci.,"An electrophoretic survey of up to forty presumed isozyme loci was carried out in Asian and African cultivated rice (O. sativa and O. glaberrima) and in weedy and wild forms of African O. breviligulata on a total of 1, 948 strains. Hidden variability was checked by a test of heat stability at thirty isozyme loci in the same species.The mean gene diversity index (""heterozygosity"") was high (0.23) in O. Sativa, medium (0.14) in wild O. breviligulata and low (0.06 and 0.03) in weedy O. breviligulata and O. glaberrima.In contrast, a maximum of seven alleles at a single locus could be distinguished in wild O. breviligulata while only three at the most were found in O. sativa and two in O. glaberrima and the weedy forms of O. breviligulata.Calculations of genetic distances showed that the cultivated, wild and weedy African species formed a genetic group distinct from O. sativa. Multivariate analysis of the data on an individual strain basis confirmed this fact and showed in turn that most varieties of O, sativa tended to cluster in two groups which correspond to the so-called Indica and Japonica subspecies. There was however a continuous array of intermediates between the two groups.Multivariate analysis also showed that the endemic African strains with the most genetic affinity to O. sativa were certain strains of the weedy form of O. breviligulata.Analysis of F1 pollen sterility among 115 strains of O, sativa permitted the extraction of one small Indica and one small Japonica group of strains characterized by a high pollen sterility relationship but most strains were intermediate.Each group had little gene diversity, with more than 80% of the loci fixed for one allele. Their isozyme patterns were remarkably complementary in that most of the various gametic associations of alleles found in the numerous intermediate strains could be explained by hybridization between varieties belonging to one and the other group. Consequently, these were assumed to represent the ancestral isozyme patterns of the Indica and Japonica subsp.Similar genetic distances, which point to a divergence time of one to a few millions years ago were found between O. glaberrima and the ancestral types of Indica and Japonica in the three combinations.Assuming the neutral theory of isozyme polymorphism, the data confirmed that O. glaberrima was domesticated from O. breviligulata independently of O, sativa. They also suggest that, at the origin of O. sativa, the Indica and the Japonica types were also domesticated independently. The large diversity of O. sativa would result: (i) primarily from introgressions that occurred between the ancestral cultivated types, together with the selection imposed by man, and (ii) secondarily, following the dispersion of cultivars, from the introgression of genes of wild rice in various areas. Some of the weedy forms of O. breviligulata could have originated from natural hybrids between the two cultivated species, O. sativa and O. glaberrima.",https://doi.org/10.1266/jjg.57.25,0
112,Ancestral polymorphism and adaptive evolution in the trichothecene mycotoxin gene cluster of phytopathogenic <i>Fusarium</i>,"Filamentous fungi within the Fusarium graminearum species complex ( Fg complex) are the primary etiological agents of Fusarium head blight (scab) of wheat and barley. Scab is an economically devastating plant disease that greatly limits grain yield and quality. In addition, scabby grain is often contaminated with trichothecene mycotoxins that act as virulence factors on some hosts, and pose a serious threat to animal health and food safety. Strain-specific differences in trichothecene metabolite profiles (chemotypes) are not well correlated with the Fg complex phylogeny based on genealogical concordance at six single-copy nuclear genes. To examine the basis for this discord between species and toxin evolution, a 19-kb region of the trichothecene gene cluster was sequenced in 39 strains chosen to represent the global genetic diversity of species in the Fg complex and four related species of Fusarium . Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that polymorphism within these virulence-associated genes is transspecific and appears to have been maintained by balancing selection acting on chemotype differences that originated in the ancestor of this important group of plant pathogens. Chemotype-specific differences in selective constraint and evidence of adaptive evolution within trichothecene genes are also reported.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.142307199,0
113,All males are not created equal: Fertility differences depend on gamete recognition polymorphisms in sea urchins,"Behaviors, morphologies, and genetic loci directly involved in reproduction have been increasingly shown to be polymorphic within populations. Explaining how such variants are maintained by selection is crucial to understanding the genetic basis of fertility differences, but direct tests of how alleles at reproductive loci affect fertility are rare. In the sea urchin genus Echinometra , the protein bindin mediates sperm attachment to eggs, evolves quickly, and is polymorphic within species. Eggs exposed to experimental sperm mixtures show strong discrimination on the basis of the males’ bindin genotype. Different females produce eggs that nonrandomly select sperm from different males, showing that variable egg–sperm interactions determine fertility. Eggs select sperm with a bindin genotype similar to their own, suggesting strong linkage between female choice and male trait loci. These experiments demonstrate that alleles at a single locus can have a strong effect on fertilization and that reproductive loci may retain functional polymorphisms through epistatic interactions between male and female traits. They also suggest that positive selection at gamete recognition loci like bindin involves strong selection within species on mate choice interactions.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.96.22.12632,0
114,Persistent nuclear ribosomal DNA sequence polymorphism in the Amelanchier agamic complex (Rosaceae),"Individual plants of several Amelanchier taxa contain many polymorphic nucleotide sites in the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA). This polymorphism is unusual because it is not recent in origin and thus has resisted homogenization by concerted evolution. Amelanchier ITS sequence polymorphism is hypothesized to be the result of gene flow between two major North American clades resolved by phylogenetic analysis of ITS sequences. Western North American species plus A. humilis and A. sanguinea of eastern North America form one clade (A), and the remaining eastern North American Amelanchier make up clade B. Five eastern North American taxa are polymorphic at many of the nucleotide sites where clades A and B have diverged and are thought to be of hybrid origin, with A. humilis or A. sanguinea as one parent and various members of clade B as the other parent. Morphological evidence suggests that A. humilis is one of the parents of one of the polymorphic taxa, a microspecies that we refer to informally as A. ""erecta."" Sequences of 21 cloned copies of the ITS1-5.8S gene-ITS2 region from one A. ""erecta"" individual are identical to A. humilis sequence or to the clade B consensus sequence, or they are apparent recombinants of A. humilis and clade B ITS repeats. Amelanchier ""erecta"" and another polymorphic taxon are suspected to be relatively old because both grow several hundred kilometers beyond the range of one of their parents. ITS sequence polymorphisms have apparently persisted in these two taxa perhaps because of polyploidy and/or agamospermy (asexual seed production), which are prevalent in the genus.",https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025705,0
115,Correlation between Molecular Packing and Optical Properties in Different Crystalline Polymorphs and Amorphous Thin Films of <i>mer</i>-Tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum(III),"Since 1987, high-luminance low-voltage driven devices based on tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum(III) (Alq3) opened the route to design low-cost large area displays and illuminators. Despite the large number of studies devoted to this material, very little is known about its basic structural and optical properties in the solid state. Therefore, we have investigated the structure(s) and the correlation between intermolecular interactions and optical properties in various Alq3 systems, including solution, amorphous thin films, and different crystalline forms. Two novel unsolvated polymorphs of Alq3, namely, α-Alq3 and β-Alq3, have been synthesized and their crystalline structures determined from X-ray diffraction data on powders (α) and single crystals (β). Crystals of α-Alq3 are triclinic, space group P-1, a = 6.2586(8) Å, b = 12.914(2) Å; c = 14.743(2) Å, α = 109.66(1)°; β = 89.66(1)°, and γ = 97.68(1)°; crystals of β-Alq3 are triclinic, space group P-1, a = 8.4433(6) Å, b = 10.2522(8) Å; c = 13.1711(10) Å, α = 108.578(1)°, β = 97.064(1)°, and γ = 89.743(1)°. Both these crystal structures consist of a racemic mixture of the mer isomer, but are characterized by different molecular packings involving well-defined short contacts between quinoxaline ligands belonging to symmetry-related Alq3 molecules with interligand spacings in the 3.5−3.9 Å range. A third “high-temperature” phase, γ-Alq3, was found to contain orientationally disordered mer-Alq3 molecules, lying about a 32 position of the trigonal P-31c space group, with a = 14.41(1) Å and c = 6.22(1) Å. In addition, a hemichlorobenzene adduct of Alq3 was also prepared and structurally characterized (monoclinic, space group P21/n, a = 10.786(1) Å, b = 13.808(2) Å, c = 16.928(2) Å, β = 97.90(2)°). Investigations of the different crystal phases, as well as of amorphous thin films and solutions by absorption, fluorescence excitation, fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy, allowed the effect of the molecular packing on the emission properties to be elucidated, the nature of the photoexcitations to be clarified, and the vibrational fingerprints of the α and β crystalline forms to be highlighted. The spectral position of fluorescence is found to be correlated with both the molecular density of the packing and the length of interligand contacts between neigboring Alq3 molecules as a consequence of different dispersive and dipolar interactions as well as different π−π orbital overlaps (the shorter the contacts, i.e., the denser the crystal, the more the fluorescence is red-shifted). The low-temperature (4.2 K) vibronic structure of the fluorescence spectrum of Alq3 is resolved for the first time. It is assigned to the Franck−Condon activity of an in-plane bending mode at ca. 525 cm-1, and it is symptomatic of the ligand-centered nature of the optical transitions. From the analysis of the vibronic progression the existence of a strong electron−phonon coupling involving the 525 cm-1 mode with a Huang−Rhys factor of ca. 2.6 ± 0.4 is inferred. The origin of the amorphous nature of the vacuum-sublimed thin films is here explained on the basis of the accessibility of many different π−π links between homo- and heterochiral Alq3 molecules.",https://doi.org/10.1021/ja993608k,0
116,Community terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms reveal insights into the diversity and dynamics of leaf endophytic bacteria,"Abstract Background Plant endophytic bacteria play an important role benefiting plant growth or being pathogenic to plants or organisms that consume those plants. Multiple species of bacteria have been found co-inhabiting plants, both cultivated and wild, with viruses and fungi. For these reasons, a general understanding of plant endophytic microbial communities and their diversity is necessary. A key issue is how the distributions of these bacteria vary with location, with plant species, with individual plants and with plant growing season. Results Five common plant species were collected monthly for four months in the summer of 2010, with replicates from four different sampling sites in the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Osage County, Oklahoma, USA. Metagenomic DNA was extracted from ground, washed plant leaf samples, and fragments of the bacterial 16S rDNA genes were amplified for analysis of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). We performed mono-digestion T-RFLP with restriction endonuclease Dde I, to reveal the structures of leaf endophytic bacterial communities, to identify the differences between plant-associated bacterial communities in different plant species or environments, and to explore factors affecting the bacterial distribution. We tested the impacts of three major factors on the leaf endophytic bacterial communities, including host plant species, sampling dates and sampling locations. Conclusions Results indicated that all of the three factors were significantly related (α = 0.05) to the distribution of leaf endophytic bacteria, with host species being the most important, followed by sampling dates and sampling locations.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-13-1,0
117,THE ROLE OF HERBIVORES IN THE MAINTENANCE OF A FLOWER COLOR POLYMORPHISM IN WILD RADISH,"Plant species exhibiting polymorphisms with respect to flower color are widespread. Our understanding of the selection pressures that may maintain these color polymorphisms has primarily been confined to one set of organisms—pollinators. Yet, selection on flower color may also be driven by other agents, such as herbivores, especially in cases where pollinators and herbivores are using the same or correlated traits to select plants. A wealth of studies have documented pollinator preference for anthocyanin-recessive color morphs (A−; yellow and white flowers) of wild radish, Raphanus sativus, over anthocyanin-dominant morphs (A+; pink and bronze flowers); yet, differences in pollination alone do not explain the maintenance of the flower color polymorphism. Here, we ask whether variation in flower color in R. sativus influences the preference and performance of herbivores for A− flower color morphs vs. A+ flower color morphs in four types of herbivores (generalist and specialist Lepidoptera, slugs, aphids, and thrips). We found that all herbivores except for aphids and thrips preferred flowering A− color morphs compared to A+ morphs of R. sativus. Furthermore, all herbivores except larvae of specialist and generalist Lepidoptera performed better on A− color morphs. Differences in plant secondary chemistry may play a role in differential herbivore preference and performance on the anthocyanin flower color morphs. Chemical analyses of leaf secondary compounds (indole glucosinolates) revealed that A+ color morphs produced higher concentrations of indole glucosinolates than A− morphs in the presence of herbivore damage. Therefore, herbivores may exhibit lower preference for A+ color morphs, and these morphs may support lower herbivore performance because they are heavily defended once damaged. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to document differential preference and performance of herbivores for different flower color morphs. Previous studies have shown that increased herbivore damage can have profound negative direct and indirect effects on the reproduction of R. sativus. The data presented here suggest that differential preference and performance of herbivores for R. sativus color morphs may counter selection on flower color exerted by pollinators.",https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[1733:trohit]2.0.co;2,0
118,Association of Neonatal Hyperbilirubinemia With Bilirubin UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase Polymorphism,"Objective. The incidence of nonphysiologic neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is twice as high in East Asians as in whites. We studied whether the condition was associated with mutations in the gene for bilirubin uridine 5′-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1), a key enzyme of bilirubin catabolism. Design. We analyzed the UGT1A1 gene in 25 Japanese neonates who had nonphysiologic hyperbilirubinemia (serum bilirubin &amp;gt;257 μmol/L) with no obvious cause. They had all received phototherapy. The background control population consisted of 50 Japanese neonates whose transcutaneous jaundice index was monitored during the first week of life. We detected mutations by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments of the gene. Results. We found a polymorphism for UGT1A1in exon 1; a G→A transition at nucleotide 211 caused arginine to replace glycine at position 71 of corresponding protein product (G71R). The frequency of the mutated allele in the hyperbilirubinemic group (0.34) was significantly higher (χ2 = 5.56) than in the control group (0.16). In the control group the peak transcutaneous jaundice index of the carriers of G71R was significantly higher than it was in the normal infants. Conclusions. The missense mutation causing G71R is the first reported polymorphism for UGT1A1, and the mutation is a risk factor for nonphysiologic neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. The high incidence of hyperbilirubinemia in the Japanese may be attributable to the high frequency of this missense mutation.",https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.103.6.1224,0
119,Multiple origins of cultivated grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L. ssp. <i>sativa</i>) based on chloroplast DNA polymorphisms,"Abstract The domestication of the Eurasian grape ( Vitis vinifera ssp. sativa ) from its wild ancestor ( Vitis vinifera ssp. sylvestris ) has long been claimed to have occurred in Transcaucasia where its greatest genetic diversity is found and where very early archaeological evidence, including grape pips and artefacts of a ‘wine culture’, have been excavated. Whether from Transcaucasia or the nearby Taurus or Zagros Mountains, it is hypothesized that this wine culture spread southwards and eventually westwards around the Mediterranean basin, together with the transplantation of cultivated grape cuttings. However, the existence of morphological differentiation between cultivars from eastern and western ends of the modern distribution of the Eurasian grape suggests the existence of different genetic contribution from local sylvestris populations or multilocal selection and domestication of sylvestris genotypes. To tackle this issue, we analysed chlorotype variation and distribution in 1201 samples of sylvestris and sativa genotypes from the whole area of the species’ distribution and studied their genetic relationships. The results suggest the existence of at least two important origins for the cultivated germplasm, one in the Near East and another in the western Mediterranean region, the latter of which gave rise to many of the current Western European cultivars. Indeed, over 70% of the Iberian Peninsula cultivars display chlorotypes that are only compatible with their having derived from western sylvestris populations.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294x.2006.03049.x,0
120,Gene amplification and microsatellite polymorphism underlie a recent insect host shift,"Host plant shifts of herbivorous insects may be a first step toward sympatric speciation and can create new pests of agriculturally important crops; however, the molecular mechanisms that mediate this process are poorly understood. Certain races of the polyphagous aphid Myzus persicae have recently adapted to feed on tobacco (Myzus persicae nicotianae) and show a reduced sensitivity to the plant alkaloid nicotine and cross-resistance to neonicotinoids a class of synthetic insecticides widely used for control. Here we show constitutive overexpression of a cytochrome P450 (CYP6CY3) allows tobacco-adapted races of M. persicae to efficiently detoxify nicotine and has preadapted them to resist neonicotinoid insecticides. CYP6CY3, is highly overexpressed in M. persicae nicotianae clones from three continents compared with M. persicae s.s. and expression level is significantly correlated with tolerance to nicotine. CYP6CY3 is highly efficient (compared with the primary human nicotine-metabolizing P450) at metabolizing nicotine and neonicotinoids to less toxic metabolites in vitro and generation of transgenic Drosophila expressing CYP6CY3 demonstrate that it confers resistance to both compounds in vivo. Overexpression of CYP6CY3 results from the expansion of a dinucleotide microsatellite in the promoter region and a recent gene amplification, with some aphid clones carrying up to 100 copies. We conclude that the mutations leading to overexpression of CYP6CY3 were a prerequisite for the host shift of M. persicae to tobacco and that gene amplification and microsatellite polymorphism are evolutionary drivers in insect host adaptation.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1314122110,0
121,Parasite-associated polymorphism in a cyclic ungulate population,"An unmanaged population of Soay sheep living on Hirta, St Kilda, Scotland is persistently unstable, fluctuating between about 600 and 1600 individuals. Population crashes occurring approximately every 3 years are primarily due to winter food shortage. In this paper we show that sheep experimentally relieved of their gastrointestinal nematodes (predominantly Teladorsagia spp.) survived a crash better than matched controls, showing that nematode parasites contribute to the probability that a sheep dies in a crash. We also show that over three successive crashes mortality was significantly different between individuals of the three different genotypes at the diallelic adenosine deaminase locus (Ada). FF animals were most likely to die, SS animals had an intermediate probability of dying, and FS animals were least likely to die. Finally, three independent lines of evidence suggest that nematode burdens differ between the three Ada genotypes. First, in August, heterozygous females are less likely to have nematode eggs in their faeces than homozygous females. Second, at lambing, the periparturient rise in faecal egg count was highest in homozygous FF individuals. Finally, during the Autumn mating season, heterozygous males has lower faecal egg counts than homozgyotes, although this relation was complicated by interactions with year and age of male. These results are consistent with the idea that Ada allele frequencies are maintained in the sheep population by parasite-associated selection.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1993.0119,0
122,Ecological and evolutionary consequences of the trophic polymorphism in Cichlasoma citrinellum (Pisces: Cichlidae),"The neotropical cichlid fish Cichlasoma citrinellum is polymorphic in the structure of its pharyngeal jaw apparatus and external morphology. The pharyngeal jaws are either gracile and bear slender, pointed teeth (papilliform) or robust with strong, rounded teeth (molariform). Molariform morphs have a ‘benthic’, and papilliform morphs a ‘limnetic’ body form. Furthermore, this species is also polychromatic, with yellow and black morphs. The molariform morphology of the pharyngeal jaw apparatus adapts the fish for cracking and feeding on snails. Based on analysis of stomach contents, 94% of the molariform morph ate snails whereas only 19%, of the papilliform morph did so. This result suggests that the morphs occupy different ecological niches. The morphology of the pharyngeal jaw apparatus does not correlate significantly with sex, but it does with body colouration (P<0.005). Cichlasoma citrinellum mate assortatively with their own colour; therefore a mating preference for colour may lead to genetic isolation of trophic morphs. The frequency of the molariform morph differs strikingly among populations of five Nicaraguan lakes and its abundance is correlated with the abundance of snails, the fishes' principal prey item. Among populations the frequency of molariform morphs decreases in the dry season. Morphology possibly changes reversibly within particular individuals between seasons. These results suggest that phenotypic plasticity and polymorphisms may be an adaptive characteristic of cichlid fishes. Patterns of intraspecific morphological variation match patterns of interspecific morphological diversification which suggests that universal developmental mechanisms canalize the possible expressions of morphology. The ability to respond morphologically to environmental shifts, in conjunction with genetically determined trophic polymorphisms and sexual selection via mate choice, could be the basis for speciation through intermediate stages of polymorphism of the impressive adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1990.tb00517.x,0
123,"Female Polymorphism, Frequency Dependence, and Rapid Evolutionary Dynamics in Natural Populations","Rapid evolutionary change over a few generations has been documented in natural populations. Such changes are observed as organisms invade new environments, and they are often triggered by changed interspecific interactions, such as differences in predation regimes. However, in spite of increased recognition of antagonistic male‐female mating interactions, there is very limited evidence that such intraspecific interactions could cause rapid evolutionary dynamics in nature. This is because ecological and longitudinal data from natural populations have been lacking. Here we show that in a color‐polymorphic damselfly species, male‐female mating interactions lead to rapid evolutionary change in morph frequencies between generations. Field data and computer simulations indicate that these changes are driven by sexual conflict, in which morph fecundities are negatively affected by frequency‐ and density‐dependent male mating harassment. These frequency‐dependent processes prevent population divergence by maintaining a female polymorphism in most populations. Although these results contrast with the traditional view of how sexual conflict enhances the rate of population divergence, they are consistent with a recent theoretical model of how females may form discrete genetic clusters in response to male mating harassment.",https://doi.org/10.1086/429278,0
124,WING POLYMORPHISM IN APHIDS II. INTERACTION BETWEEN APHIDS,"A study has been made of the effect of “crowding” on both prenatal and postnatal control of wing development in aphids. In experiments on prenatal form control it was shown that brief controlled encounters of only a minute's duration between two adult aphids could cause them to switch from producing apterous to alate progeny. Aphids which had been exposed to contact with other aphids continued to produce alate progeny for several days. Evidence from a number of experiments suggests that the principle stimulus involved is tactile. In experiments on postnatal form control, it was shown that more alates developed among larvae which were reared together than among larvae reared in isolation. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG FLÜGELPOLYMORPHISMUS BEI BLATTLÄUSEN. II. WECHSELWIRKUNG ZWISCHEN DEN APHIDEN In großen Blattlauskolonien werden leichter Geflügelte gebildet als in kleinen. Dafür gibt es zwei Ursachen. Bei hoher Dichte verändern die Aphiden die Physiologie der Pflanze dergestalt, daß bei den Läusen, die an ihr saugen, die Geflügeltenbildung gefördert wird; und bei hoher Befallsdichte vermehrt sich für die Aphiden auch die Wahrscheinlichkeit, stimulatorische Wirkungen aufeinander auszuüben. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird die Natur und Wirkungsweise der Wechselwirkung zwischen Individuen von Aphis craccivora Koch untersucht. Die Blattläuse wurden bei 20° und 10stündiger Photoperiode in völliger Isolation auf kleinen Blattscheiben gehalten und weiter vermehrt, die — aus Blättern ihrer Wirtspflanze herausgestanzt — auf einer Nährlösung schwammen. Unter diesen Bedingungen brachten sie überwiegend ungeflügelte Nachkommen hervor. Zur Erzeugung geflügelter Nachkommen konnten sie durch kurze Begegnungen mit anderen Aphiden angeregt werden. In einigen Versuchen wurden die Blattläuse für verschiedene Zeitabschnitte in kleine Käfige zusammengesperrt, in anderen wurden sie herausgefangen und veranlaßt, in rascher Folge mehrere Male übereinander hinwegzukriechen. Beide Behandlungsweisen bewirkten, daß die Aphiden von der Produktion ungeflügelter zur Produktion geflügelter Nachkommen umschalteten. Eine Anzahl von Versuchen berechtigen zu der Annahme, daß weder visuelle noch olfaktorische Reize dabei mitwirken, und es ist zu vermuten, daß in der Hauptsache Berührungsreize den Ausschlag geben. Der Versuch, einen entsprechenden künstlichen Reiz zu setzen, hatte nur zum Teil Erfolg. Die Blattläuse, welche einem Kontakt mit anderen Läusen ausgesetzt gewesen waren, wurden täglich auf frische Blattscheiben weitergesetzt und ihre Nachkommenschaft auf den Blattscheiben aufgezogen, auf denen sie geboren wurde. Auf diese Weise ließ es sich zeigen, daß kurze Begegnungen zwischen Blattläusen mehrere Tage lang einen Einfluß auf die Form der Nachkommenschaft beibehalten können, die sie danach produzieren. Die Flügelentwicklung von Aphis craccivora kann auch während der postnatalen Entwicklung beeinflußt werden und es ließ sich nachweisen, daß auch hierbei die Wechselwirkung zwischen den Larven einen wesentlichen Faktor darstellt. Isoliert auf Blattscheiben aufgezogene Larven entwickelten sich weniger häufig zu Geflügelten als solche, die in Dichten von zwei oder mehreren je Blattscheibe gehalten wurden.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1965.tb02342.x,0
125,"A Prospective Study of Plasma Vitamin D Metabolites, Vitamin D Receptor Polymorphisms, and Prostate Cancer","Background Vitamin D insufficiency is a common public health problem nationwide. Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25[OH]D), the most commonly used index of vitamin D status, is converted to the active hormone 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH]2D), which, operating through the vitamin D receptor (VDR), inhibits in vitro cell proliferation, induces differentiation and apoptosis, and may protect against prostate cancer. Despite intriguing results from laboratory studies, previous epidemiological studies showed inconsistent associations of circulating levels of 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, and several VDR polymorphisms with prostate cancer risk. Few studies have explored the joint association of circulating vitamin D levels with VDR polymorphisms. Methods and Findings During 18 y of follow-up of 14,916 men initially free of diagnosed cancer, we identified 1,066 men with incident prostate cancer (including 496 with aggressive disease, defined as stage C or D, Gleason 7–10, metastatic, and fatal prostate cancer) and 1,618 cancer-free, age- and smoking-matched control participants in the Physicians' Health Study. We examined the associations of prediagnostic plasma levels of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D, individually and jointly, with total and aggressive disease, and explored whether relations between vitamin D metabolites and prostate cancer were modified by the functional VDR FokI polymorphism, using conditional logistic regression. Among these US physicians, the median plasma 25(OH)D levels were 25 ng/ml in the blood samples collected during the winter or spring and 32 ng/ml in samples collected during the summer or fall. Nearly 13% (summer/fall) to 36% (winter/spring) of the control participants were deficient in 25(OH)D (<20 ng/ml) and 51% (summer/fall) and 77% (winter/spring) had insufficient plasma 25(OH)D levels (<32 ng/ml). Plasma levels of 1,25(OH)2D did not vary by season. Men whose levels for both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D were below (versus above) the median had a significantly increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–3.4), although the interaction between the two vitamin D metabolites was not statistically significant (pinteraction = 0.23). We observed a significant interaction between circulating 25(OH)D levels and the VDR FokI genotype (pinteraction < 0.05). Compared with those with plasma 25(OH)D levels above the median and with the FokI FF or Ff genotype, men who had low 25(OH)D levels and the less functional FokI ff genotype had increased risks of total (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.3) and aggressive prostate cancer (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.1–5.8). Among men with plasma 25(OH)D levels above the median, the ff genotype was no longer associated with risk. Conversely, among men with the ff genotype, high plasma 25(OH)D level (above versus below the median) was related to significant 60%∼70% lower risks of total and aggressive prostate cancer. Conclusions Our data suggest that a large proportion of the US men had suboptimal vitamin D status (especially during the winter/spring season), and both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D may play an important role in preventing prostate cancer progression. Moreover, vitamin D status, measured by 25(OH)D in plasma, interacts with the VDR FokI polymorphism and modifies prostate cancer risk. Men with the less functional FokI ff genotype (14% in the European-descent population of this cohort) are more susceptible to this cancer in the presence of low 25(OH)D status.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040103,0
126,The Fasciola hepatica genome: gene duplication and polymorphism reveals adaptation to the host environment and the capacity for rapid evolution,"Abstract Background The liver fluke Fasciola hepatica is a major pathogen of livestock worldwide, causing huge economic losses to agriculture, as well as 2.4 million human infections annually. Results Here we provide a draft genome for F. hepatica , which we find to be among the largest known pathogen genomes at 1.3 Gb. This size cannot be explained by genome duplication or expansion of a single repeat element, and remains a paradox given the burden it may impose on egg production necessary to transmit infection. Despite the potential for inbreeding by facultative self-fertilisation, substantial levels of polymorphism were found, which highlights the evolutionary potential for rapid adaptation to changes in host availability, climate change or to drug or vaccine interventions. Non-synonymous polymorphisms were elevated in genes shared with parasitic taxa, which may be particularly relevant for the ability of the parasite to adapt to a broad range of definitive mammalian and intermediate molluscan hosts. Large-scale transcriptional changes, particularly within expanded protease and tubulin families, were found as the parasite migrated from the gut, across the peritoneum and through the liver to mature in the bile ducts. We identify novel members of anti-oxidant and detoxification pathways and defined their differential expression through infection, which may explain the stage-specific efficacy of different anthelmintic drugs. Conclusions The genome analysis described here provides new insights into the evolution of this important pathogen, its adaptation to the host environment and external selection pressures. This analysis also provides a platform for research into novel drugs and vaccines.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0632-2,0
127,A Gain-of-Function Polymorphism Controlling Complex Traits and Fitness in Nature,"Identification of the causal genes that control complex trait variation remains challenging, limiting our appreciation of the evolutionary processes that influence polymorphisms in nature. We cloned a quantitative trait locus that controls plant defensive chemistry, damage by insect herbivores, survival, and reproduction in the natural environments where this polymorphism evolved. These ecological effects are driven by duplications in the BCMA (branched-chain methionine allocation) loci controlling this variation and by two selectively favored amino acid changes in the glucosinolate-biosynthetic cytochrome P450 proteins that they encode. These changes cause a gain of novel enzyme function, modulated by allelic differences in catalytic rate and gene copy number. Ecological interactions in diverse environments likely contribute to the widespread polymorphism of this biochemical function.",https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1221636,0
128,Plasma Nitric Oxide Concentrations and Nitric Oxide Synthase Gene Polymorphisms in Coronary Artery Disease,"Plasma NOx (nitrate and nitrite) is a stable end product of the vasodilator NO. Several polymorphisms in the endothelial constitutive NO synthase (ecNOS) gene have been reported, including the 4a/4b VNTR polymorphism in intron 4, the E298D mutation in exon 7, and the G10-T polymorphism in intron 23. The aims of this study were to examine plasma NOx in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and to assess the association between plasma NOx concentrations and the three ecNOS gene polymorphisms.Plasma NOx was measured in samples from 128 healthy controls and from 110 CAD patients at least 2 months after myocardial infarction. Three genetic polymorphisms that are known or have been suggested to be associated with plasma NOx concentration were also analyzed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism.Median plasma NOx was significantly higher (P <0.001) in CAD patients (95.9 micromol/L) than in controls (73.8 micromol/L). Furthermore, the median plasma NOx was significantly higher (P <0.001) in hypertensive CAD patients (116.0 micromol/L) than in controls and normotensive CAD patients (86.0 micromol/L). The G-allele frequency of the G10-T polymorphism in intron 23 was significantly higher in CAD patients than in controls. Other polymorphisms showed no differences in allelic frequencies among the control and CAD groups. In controls, individuals with the E298D mutation in exon 7 (136.1 micromol/L) showed significantly higher (P = 0.001) median plasma NOx than those without this mutation (64.5 micromol/L).Plasma NOx was higher in hypertensive CAD patients than in normotensive CAD patients and controls. The E298D polymorphism of the ecNOS gene was associated with increased plasma NOx. Further study is needed to understand the gene expression and enzyme activity of ecNOS and their association with genotypes.",https://doi.org/10.1093/clinchem/46.10.1626,0
129,Trophic Polymorphism in the Pumpkinseed Sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus Linnaeus): Effects of Environment on Ontogeny,"The effects of diet on morphology of the feeding apparatus were explored in the pumpkinseed sunfish, Lepomis gibbosus Linnaeus. Adult pumpkinseeds feed primarily on gastropod molluscs that they crush between their pharyngeal jaws. Development of the muscles and bones of the pharyngeal jaws was contrasted in two Michigan (USA) lakes that differed both in snail density and in the numbers of snails in pumpkinseed diets. In least squares regressions of muscle masses, bone masses and bone shape variables on body mass, all structures examined showed isometry or positive allometry, with those structures most directly involved in snail crushing tending to scale with positive allometry. Of nine pharyngeal jaw muscles that were examined, analyses of covariance found six to be significantly larger in fish from snail-rich Three Lakes. The primary crushing muscle, the levator posterior, was more than twice as massive in Three Lakes fish than it was in fish from snail-poor Wintergreen lake. All three of the pharyngeal jaw bones used to exert crushing forces on snails were found to be significantly larger and of different shape in fish from Three Lakes. The masses of one muscle and two bones that do not function in prey crushing showed no differences between lakes. Teeth on the crushing surfaces of the jaw bones were worn down, and thus, shorter :tPresent address: P. C. Wainwright, Department of Biological Sciences, Florida International University, Miami, Florida 33199, USA. in Three Lakes fish. Ontogenetic variation in growth rates of two muscles, the levator posterior and the retractor dorsalis, occurred in fish from Three Lakes. These muscles exhibited strong positive allometry between 40 and 80mm standard length (SL), the size range over which fish diets shift from soft-bodied invertebrates to snails, but growth slowed to strong negative allometry in fish larger than 80 mm. These differences between lakes in muscle and bone growth appear to be a direct consequence of the physical regime created by repeatedly crushing snails during ontogeny. This plasticity indicates that transformations in the feeding mechanism may originate as specific responses to the demands of novel diets.

130,The Human Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor +1166 A/C Polymorphism Attenuates MicroRNA-155 Binding,"The adverse effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) are primarily mediated through the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R). A silent polymorphism (+1166 A/C) in the human AT1R gene has been associated with cardiovascular disease, possibly as a result of enhanced AT1R activity. Because this polymorphism occurs in the 3′-untranslated region of the human AT1R gene, the biological importance of this mutation has always been questionable. Computer alignment demonstrated that the +1166 A/C polymorphism occurred in a cis-regulatory site, which is recognized by a specific microRNA (miRNA), miR-155. miRNAs are noncoding RNAs that silence gene expression by base-pairing with complementary sequences in the 3′-untranslated region of target RNAs. When the +1166 C-allele is present, base-pairing complementarity is interrupted, and the ability of miR-155 to interact with the cis-regulatory site is decreased. As a result, miR-155 no longer attenuates translation as efficiently as demonstrated by luciferase reporter and Ang II radioreceptor binding assays. In situ hybridization experiments demonstrated that mature miR-155 is abundantly expressed in the same cell types as the AT1R (e.g. endothelial and vascular smooth muscle). Finally, when human primary vascular smooth muscle cells were transfected with an antisense miR-155 inhibitor, endogenous human AT1R expression and Ang II-induced ERK1/2 activation were significantly increased. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the AT1R and miR-155 are co-expressed and that miR-155 translationally represses the expression of AT1R in vivo. Therefore, our study provides the first feasible biochemical mechanism by which the +1166 A/C polymorphism can lead to increased AT1R densities and possibly cardiovascular disease.

These include fluid homeostasis, aldosterone production, renal function, and contraction of vascular smooth muscle (1DeGasparo M. Catt K.J. Inagami T. Wright J.W. Unger T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 415-472PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from these hemodynamic actions, Ang II is also capable of inducing a multitude of nonhemodynamic effects, such as the induction of reactive oxygen species, cytokines, stimulation of collagen synthesis, apoptosis, and hypertrophy (2Saito Y. Berk B.C. Curr. Hypertens. Rep. 2002; 4: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 3Mehta P.K. Griendling K.K. Am. J.

Most of the biological responses to Ang II are mediated by its interaction with a G protein-coupled receptor defined as the type 1 Ang II receptor, or AT1R (1DeGasparo M. Catt K.J. Inagami T. Wright J.W. Unger T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 415-472PubMed Google Scholar). AT1R activation triggers a variety of signaling pathways, including tyrosine kinase-mediated phosphorylation, production of arachidonic acid metabolites, alteration of reactive oxidant species, and fluxes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (2Saito Y. Berk B.C. Curr. Hypertens. Rep. 2002; 4: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 3Mehta P.K. Griendling K.K. Am. J.

Therefore, the nonhemodynamic functions of Ang II are thought to play a central role not only in the etiology of hypertension in humans but also in the pathophysiology of cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling, heart failure, vascular thickening, and atherosclerosis (6Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 34: 115-126Crossref Scopus (19648) Google Scholar, 7Vaughan D.E. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1496-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Nickenig G. Michaelsen F.

Because the expression level of the AT1R defines the biological efficacy of Ang II, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which AT1R density is regulated. Recently, our laboratory demonstrated that microRNA-155 (miR-155) specifically interacted with the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of the human AT1R (hAT1R) mRNA and inhibited the expression of the hAT1R in fibroblasts (10Martin M.M.

Chem. 2006; 281: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). miRNAs are produced endogenously in mammalian cells by specific RNA gene transcription or from introns during pre-mRNA splicing (11Ambros V.

Lin S.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 342: 1-18PubMed Google Scholar). miRNAs are expressed as long hairpin-forming precursor RNAs that get processed into partially double-stranded RNAs in which one strand is the mature miRNA (i.e. 21-23 nucleotides). The mature miRNA is taken up by a protein complex that is similar, if not identical, to the RNA-induced silencing complex that supports RNA interference, and the miRNA-bound complex functions to regulate translation (15Hutvagner G.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). It has recently been demonstrated that mRNA targets sites with as few as 7 bp of complementarity (designated as the ""seed"" sequence) to the miRNA 5′ end are sufficient to confer regulation in vivo (21Doench J.G. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar, 22Brennecke J. Stark A. Russell R.B. Cohen S.M. Plos Biol. 2005; 3: 404-418Crossref Scopus (1888) Google Scholar). The hAT1R gene has been found to be highly polymorphic (23Baudin B. Exp. Physiol. 2004; 90: 277-282Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In particular, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been described in which there is an A/C transversion at position 1166 in the 3′-UTR of this gene. The increased frequency of the hAT1R +1166 C-allele has been associated with essential hypertension (24Bonnardeaux A. Davies E. Jeunemaitre X. Fery I. Charru A. Clauser E. Tiret L. Cambien F. Corvol P. Soubrier F. Hypertension. 1994; 24: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 25Wang W.Y.S. Zee R.Y.L. Morris B.J. Clin.

Troughton R.W. Richards A.M. Winterbourn C.C. Hypertension. 2006; 47: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance of this polymorphism is uncertain because of its location within the noncoding region of the hAT1R gene. Because we previously demonstrated that miR-155 interacted with a specific cis-response element localized in the hAT1R 3′-UTR (10Martin M.M. Lee E.J. Buckenberger J.A. Schmittgen T.D. Elton T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), we investigated whether there was a correlation between the +1166 A/C SNP and the miR-155-binding site. Computer alignment revealed that the +1166 A/C SNP occurs in the cis-response element where miR-155 was shown to interact. Therefore, the aim of the following study was to investigate whether the presence of the +1166 C-allele decreased the ability of miR-155 to translationally regulate the expression of the hAT1R. Importantly, we demonstrate that the A→C bp change results in augmented hAT1R expression because of the inability of miR-155 to inhibit translation of hAT1R mRNAs as efficiently. Cell Culture—CHO cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 80 units/ml penicillin, 80 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 0.0175 mg/ml l-proline (Sigma). Primary dermal arteriolar vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were cultured from punch biopsies as reported previously (30Chotani M.A. Mitra S. Su B.Y. Flavahan S. Eid A.H. Clark K.R. Montague C. Paris H. Handy D.E. Flavahan N.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286 (-H67): H59Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These cells were grown in Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, 80 units/ml penicillin, and 80 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The human VSMCs were genotyped as described previously (24Bonnardeaux A. Davies E. Jeunemaitre X. Fery I. Charru A. Clauser E. Tiret L. Cambien F. Corvol P. Soubrier F. Hypertension. 1994; 24: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) and shown to be AA at position +1166. All cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Constructs—An 883-bp fragment encompassing the entire hAT1R 3′-UTR was PCR-amplified utilizing the following sense (5′-CATGTTCGAAACCTGTCCATAAAG-3′) and antisense (5′-ATAAAATTATTTTATTTTAAAGTAAAT-3′) primers using standard procedures and a proofreading polymerase (Platinum Pfu, Invitrogen). A full-length hAT1R cDNA clone (10Martin M.M. Lee E.J. Buckenberger J.A. Schmittgen T.D. Elton T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) was used as template. The PCR product was subcloned into the pCR®2.1 vector following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was subsequently isolated from recombinant colonies and sequenced to ensure authenticity. The hAT1R 3′-UTR inserts were removed from the pCR®2.1 plasmid by EcoRI digestion. The fragments were gel-purified, filled in, and blunt end-ligated into a filled in HindIII site that is located downstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene (pMIR-REPORT™, Ambion). The authenticity and orientation of the inserts relative to the luciferase gene were confirmed by sequencing. The resulting plasmid was designated p3′-UTR-A. The reporter plasmid, p3′-UTR-C, was generated by utilizing the p3′-UTR-A plasmid as template, and an A→C mutation was generated at position 86 of the hAT1R 3′-UTR, which is equivalent to the +1166 A→C SNP (24Bonnardeaux A. Davies E. Jeunemaitre X. Fery I. Charru A. Clauser E. Tiret L. Cambien F. Corvol P. Soubrier F. Hypertension. 1994; 24: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Briefly, a forward mutagenic primer (5′-CACTACCAAATGAGCCTTAGCTACTTTTCAG-3′) and a complementary reverse mutagenic primer (5′-CTGAAAAGTAGCTAAGGCTCATTTGGTAGT-3′) were synthesized and utilized in PCR experiments as described by the manufacturer. The site of the ""C"" mutation is shown in boldface. The amplification reaction was treated with DpnI restriction enzyme to eliminate the parental template, and the remaining DNA was used for transformation. The presence of the A→C mutation (i.e. equivalent to the +1166 A/C SNP) was confirmed by dideoxy chain termination sequencing. A full-length hAT1R cDNA which encompassed the entire open reading frame and the 3′-UTR was PCR-amplified (31Martin M.M. Willardson B.M. Burton G.F. White C.R. McLaughlin J.N. Bray S.M. Ogilvie Jr., J.W. Elton T.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the product was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector, pCR®3.1 (Invitrogen), and sequenced to ensure authenticity and proper orientation with respect to the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter. This expression construct was designated pCR/hAT1R-A. The A→C SNP was generated in this construct as described above. The mutant construct was designated pCR/hAT1R-C. The A→C SNP corresponds to the +1166 A/C SNP described previously (24Bonnardeaux A. Davies E. Jeunemaitre X. Fery I. Charru A. Clauser E. Tiret L. Cambien F. Corvol P. Soubrier F. Hypertension. 1994; 24: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Transformed bacterial cultures were grown, and each reporter construct was purified using the PureLink™ Hipure Plasmid Maxiprep kit (Invitrogen). Hybridization Prediction—The minimum free energy hybridization of miR-155 and the hAT1R 3′-UTR cis-response element harboring either the A-allele or C-allele were predicted by RNAHYBRID software (35Rehmsmeier M. Steffen P. Hocksmann M. Giegerich R. RNA. 2004; 10: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). Transfection—Hsa-miR-155, a partially double-stranded RNA that mimics endogenous precursor miR-155, miRNA Negative Control 1 and miRNA Negative Control 2, which are random sequence controls, were obtained from Ambion. A ""customer-defined"" miRNA precursor molecule was synthesized (Ambion) that harbored a mutation in the miR-155 sequence and was designated mut-miR-155. Anti-miR-155, designed to inhibit endogenous miR-155 function, and anti-miR Negative Control 1 were also obtained from Ambion. Transfection of CHO cells with small RNAs was optimized utilizing Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and a fluorescein-labeled double-stranded RNA oligomer designated BLOCK-iT™ fluorescent oligonucleotide (Invitrogen). Alternatively, VSMC transfection was optimized using the same fluorescent small RNA; however, magnet-assisted transfection was utilized as described by the manufacturer (IBA BioTAGnology, Gottingen, Germany; magnets were purchased separately from Engineered Concepts, Birmingham, AL). Once transfection conditions were optimized, CHO and/or VSMCs (approaching 100% transfection efficiency in both cell types) were transfected with the reporter or expression constructs described above and the appropriate miRNA precursor as indicated. After 48 h, cells were washed and lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were determined using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a luminometer. The relative reporter activity was obtained by normalization to the Renilla luciferase activity. In some experiments, transfected cells were utilized for real time PCR, radioreceptor binding assays, and/or immunoassays. AT1 Receptor Radioligand Binding Studies—Whole cell AT1 receptor binding was measured as described previously (32Martin M.M. Buckenberger J.A. Knoell D.L. Strauch A.R. Elton T.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2006; 249: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, 48 h after transfection, the cell medium was aspirated and replaced with monoiodinated [125I-Sar1,Ile8]Ang II (2-3 × 105 cpm; Peptide Radioiodination Service, Oxford, MS) in Hanks' balanced salt solution, 20 mm Hepes, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After incubation at room temperature for 60 min, unbound ligand was removed by washing each well twice with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Bound ligand was recovered by dissolving the protein in each well with 1 ml of 0.5 m NaOH, 0.01% SDS. Nonspecific binding was determined by performing the binding assay in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled Ang II. The quantity of [125I-Sar1,Ile8]Ang II present in each sample was determined using a Cobra γ-spectrophotometer (Packard Bell, Palo Alto, CA). Protein content in wells was assessed using the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad). Values presented represent specific (total minus nonspecific) binding. Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from VSMCs and CHO cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen). The RNA was subsequently treated with RNase-free DNase I, and mature miR-155 was quantified utilizing the TaqMan microRNA assay kit for hsa-miR-155 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described previously (33Jiang J. Lee E.J. Gusev Y. Schmittgen T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 17: 5394-5403Crossref Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 ng of total RNA was heated for 5 min at 80 °C with 10 μm of the 18 S rRNA antisense primer followed by cooling to room temperature. Three microliters of the 5× RT primer was then added, and the cDNA was synthesized as described (34Chen C. Ridzon D.A. Broomer A.J. Zhou Z. Lee D.H. Nguyen J.T. Barbisin M. Xu N.L. Mahuvakar V.R. Andersen M.R. Lao K.Q. Livak K.J. Guegler K.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: E179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4174) Google Scholar). Real time PCR (10 μl total reaction) was performed as described using 1 μl of a 1:50 dilution of cDNA. Gene expression was calculated relative to 18 S rRNA as described above and multiplied by 106 to simplify data presentation. Alternatively, total RNA was treated as described above; however, cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT). The expression of hAT1R mRNA relative to 18 S rRNA was determined as described above. The hAT1R-specific primers used were as follows: sense primer, 5′-CACCATGTTTTGAGGTTGACTGAC-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-CAGGCTAGGGAGATTGCATTTCTG-3′. Immunoassay for ERK—Twenty four hours after transfection the VSMCs were washed and serum-starved for an additional 24 h. Serum-starved cells were stimulated with Ang II (1 μm) for 5 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with a concentrated buffer solution containing 250 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 200 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.04% bromphenol blue (300 μl/1 × 106 cells). An aliquot of the supernatant was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to nitrocellulose membrane and blocking with 5% nonfat milk, the blot was incubated with an antibody (1:2000) specific for phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). The immunoblot was then incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and visualized with ECL, and the auto-radiograph was quantitated by densitometric analysis. The blots were subsequently stripped and reprobed with an ERK1/2-specific antibody (Cell Signaling) to normalize the level of phosphorylated ERK to total ERK. In Situ Hybridization—Locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes complementary to human mature miR-155 (5′-CCCCTATCACGATTAGCATTAA-3′) and scrambled negative control (5′-TTCACAATGCGTTATCGGATGT-3′) digoxigenin-labeled at the 5′ position were purchased from Exiqon (Vedbaek, Denmark). Detection of RNAs by in situ hybridization utilizing oligonucleotide probes was performed as described previously (50Nuovo G.J. Protocols and Applications. 1997; (, 3rd Ed., pp. , Lippincott/Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD): 123-192Google Scholar). Briefly, human tissues were deparaffinized, treated with protease (30 min in 2 mg/ml of pepsin), washed in sterile water, and subsequently washed with 100% ethanol and air-dried. Hybridization was performed at 37 °C overnight followed by a low stringency wash in 0.2× SSC and 2% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 10 min. The probe-target complex was visualized utilizing a digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase acting on the chromogen nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Nuclear fast red served as the counterstain. Statistical Analysis—All data are reported as means ± S.E. When comparisons were made between two different groups, statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. When multiple comparisons were made, statistical significance was determined using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post-test. All statistical analysis was performed using the software package Prism 4.0b (GraphPad Software, San Diego).

However, the association of this polymorphism with cardiovascular disease is difficult to interpret because it is not known how a genetic variation in the noncoding region results in differences in hAT1R expression. As a result of our demonstration that miR-155 can interact with a specific cis-response element localized in the hAT1R 3′-UTR and inhibit the expression of this receptor (10Martin M.M. Lee E.J. Buckenberger J.A. Schmittgen T.D. Elton T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), we investigated whether there was a relationship between the +1166 A/C SNP and the miR-155-binding site. Computer alignment demonstrated that this polymorphism occurs in the middle of the miR-155 complementarity seed binding sequence (Fig. 1, A and B). To determine whether the thermodynamics of binding between miR-155 and the hAT1R 3′-UTR cis-response element harboring either the A- or C-allele was distinct, the minimal free energy of hybridization was predicted (35Rehmsmeier M. Steffen P. Hocksmann M. Giegerich R. RNA. 2004; 10: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). Computational modeling suggests that the presence of the C-allele leads to a decrease in free energy (Fig. 1, C and D), which would result in a destabilized miR-155/hAT1R 3′-UTR hybrid. Therefore, we hypothesize that when the +1166 C-allele is expressed, hAT1R mRNAs would not fulfill the seed sequence target requirement, which in turn would result in augmented hAT1R expression levels because of the decreased binding of miR-155 with the hAT1R 3′-UTR cis-response element. The hAT1R +1166 C-allele Decreases Ability of miR-155 to Regulate Translation—To begin to test this hypothesis, the entire hAT1R 3′-UTR (i.e. 883-bp region) was subcloned immediately downstream from the firefly luciferase open reading frame, and the resulting construct was designated p3′-UTR-A (Fig. 2A). This construct harbors the hAT1R +1166 A-allele. In contrast, the mutant p3′-UTR-C construct expresses the hAT1R +1166 C-allele (Fig. 2A). To test the potency of miR-155 in regulating luciferase expression, either p3′-UTR-A or p3′-UTR-C was transfected into CHO cells with increasing concentrations of miR-155 or control nontargeting miRNAs (i.e. Con 1 or Con 2), and luciferase activities were determined. CHO cells were utilized because they do not express miR-155, 3T. S. Elton, unpublished observations. and therefore, endogenous expression of this miRNA did not mask the effects of the transfected miR-155. Dose-response experiments demonstrated that relative luciferase activity was significantly decreased with as little as 1 nm of miR-155 in CHO cells co-transfected with the p3′-UTR-A construct (Fig. 2B). A maximal decrease was obtained in p3′-UTR-A-transfected cells with a concentration of 30-50 nm miR-155. In contrast, the potency of miR-155 was dramatically reduced in CHO cells transfected with the p3′-UTR-C construct (Fig. 2B). For example, firefly luciferase activity of cells transfected with the p3′-UTR-C construct was not significantly reduced until co-transfected with 30 nm miR-155. Additionally, transfection of 50 nm miR-155 resulted in a maximal decrease of luciferase activity by only ∼20% (Fig. 2B). To investigate the importance of the SNP occurring in the middle of the miRNA and the hAT1R mRNA target seed complementarity sequence, a mutant miR-155 precursor was synthesized which compensated for the hAT1R +1166 C-allele by placing a complementary ""G"" residue in the miRNA sequence (Fig. 3A). However, by generating the mutant miR-155, a base pair mismatch was created within the hAT1R +1166 A-allele and the seed sequence of the mutant miR-155 (Fig. 3A). Identical transfection experiments were performed as described above; however, in these experiments, the mutant miR-155 was utilized (Fig. 3B). In contrast to the results obtained utilizing miR-155, mutant miR-155 demonstrated an increased potency at inhibiting relative luciferase activity in CHO cells transfected with the p3′-UTR-C construct and decreased for cells transfected with the p3′-UTR-A construct. Taken together, these results demonstrate that at least 7 bp of contiguous complementarity is needed between miR-155 and its hAT1R 3′-UTR target site to maximally inhibit luciferase activity and that a base pair mismatch within the seed sequence diminishes the ability of miR-155 to inhibit translation. To validate the above results, expression constructs, which result in the synthesis of hAT1R mRNAs that harbor either the +1166 A-allele (i.e. phAT1R-A) or the +1166 C-allele (i.e. phAT1R-C) (Fig. 4A), were co-transfected with 50 nm miR-Con, miR-155, or mutant miR-155, and hAT1R levels were quantitated by performing radioreceptor binding assays. Importantly, only miR-155 significantly inhibited the expression of the hAT1R synthesized in CHO cells transfected wi",https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m701050200,0
131,A Human-specific Polymorphism in the Coding Region of the Aggrecan Gene,"Aggrecan, one of the major structural genes of cartilage, encodes a proteoglycan core protein composed of an extended central glycosaminoglycan-bearing domain, flanked by globular domains at each end. The central region consists of long stretches of repeating amino acids that serve as attachment sites for glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin and keratan sulfate; the terminal globular domains interact with other cartilage components. The glycosaminoglycan attachment region is encoded in several species by a single large exon, within which are several different types of repeating sequences. Several species show within this exon a similar block of conserved repeats for attachment of chondroitin sulfate, but in humans this group of repeats is particularly well conserved. Examination of genomic DNA from a population of unrelated individuals by polymerase chain reaction or Southern blot assays shows this block of repeat sequences exists in multiple allelic forms, which differ by the number of repeats at this site in each allele. Thirteen different alleles have been identified, with repeat numbers ranging from 13 to 33. This is an unusual example of an expressed variable number of tandem repeat polymorphism. This polymorphism is apparently restricted to humans, of several species examined. This polymorphism results in individuals with differing length aggrecan core proteins, bearing different numbers of potential attachment sites for chondroitin sulfate. The possibility exists for a molecular understanding of biological variation in cartilage functional properties.

This polymorphism results in individuals with differing length aggrecan core proteins, bearing different numbers of potential attachment sites for chondroitin sulfate. The possibility exists for a molecular understanding of biological variation in cartilage functional properties. Aggrecan is the major proteoglycan of cartilage (1Wight T.N. Heinegard D.K. Hascall V.C. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of the Extracellular Matrix. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1991: 45-78Google Scholar) and is expressed at high levels only in this tissue; low levels of aggrecan expression have been reported in notochord (2Stirpe N.S. Goetinck P.F. Development. 1989; 107: 22-33Google Scholar, 3Domowicz M. Li H. Hennig A. Henry J. Vertel B.M. Schwartz N.B. Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 655-664Google Scholar) and calvaria (4Wong M. Lawton T. Goetinck P.F. Kuhn J.L. Goldstein S.A. Bonadio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5592-5598Google Scholar). Aggrecan is composed of two types of structural elements, an extended central core and three flanking globular domains. Two of the globular domains are at the amino terminus, share homology with link protein (5Doege K. Sasaki M. Horigan E. Hassell J.R. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17757-17767Google Scholar), and one, at least (G1), binds strongly to hyaluronan and link protein, effectively localizing the molecule in the cartilage matrix. The third globular domain, G3, shares intriguing structural features with the selectin family of cell adhesion molecules (6Tedder T.F. Steeber D.A. Chen A. Engel P. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 866-873Google Scholar) and may also provide important interactions with other cell or matrix components. The bulk of the molecule is made up of over 100 chondroitin sulfate chains attached to specific serine residues in the central portion of the core protein, the chondroitin-sulfate attachment region, or CS 1The abbreviations used are: CS, chondroitin sulfate; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; VNTR, variable number of tandem repeats; CEPH, Center Etude Polymorphisme Humaine. 1The abbreviations used are: CS, chondroitin sulfate; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; VNTR, variable number of tandem repeats; CEPH, Center Etude Polymorphisme Humaine. domain. These specific serine residues occur adjacent to glycine residues, and there has been considerable discussion as to what other features define a consensus attachment signal for chondroitin sulfate (7Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 229-255Google Scholar); these features include a nearby acidic amino acid as well as a nonpolar residue. It has not been determined whether all the suitable serine-glycine pairs are equally likely to be substituted with chondroitin sulfate. It is the tight packing of these highly hydrophilic, GAG-substituted molecules within the constraining collagen fibrillar network that provides the unique swelling pressure and resistance to compressive forces essential to cartilage function in articular joint surfaces. Analysis of the cDNA sequences for rat (5Doege K. Sasaki M. Horigan E. Hassell J.R. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17757-17767Google Scholar) and human aggrecan (8Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Google Scholar) produced the observation that the serine-glycine pairs occurred in two distinct patterns of repeating sequences, designated the CS-1 and CS-2 repeat regions, and that the human cDNA contained a subregion of the CS-1 repeat that was remarkably conserved in 19 repeats of 19 amino acids each. The degree of conservation was that of identity for most of the repeats at the nucleic acid sequence level. Several restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the human aggrecan gene were identified for use in genetic linkage studies (9Finkelstein J. Doege K. Yamada Y. Pyeritz R. Graham J. Moeschler J. Pauli R. Hecht J. Francomano C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 97-102Google Scholar), and one, aHaeIII restriction fragment length polymorphism, was particularly polymorphic. The cDNA probe used in that case was pSA003, which encodes the CS domain including the highly repeated subregion. As the CS domain of aggrecan is encoded by a single large exon in the human gene (10Doege K. Sasaki M. Yamada Y. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 200-202Google Scholar, 11Valhmu W.B. Palmer G.D. Rivers P.A. Ebara S. Cheng J.-F. Fischer S. Ratcliffe A. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 535-542Google Scholar), and the highly repeated region within the CS domain is flanked by HaeIII sites, the possibility was suggested that this repeat region might constitute a rare VNTR within the structural coding region of a gene. The work reported here is a result of a study confirming this hypothesis, prompting the examination of the functional and biological consequences of this variation in a major component of cartilage. DNA samples were obtained for the 40 large family founder couples from the CEPH (Center Etude Polymorphisme Humaine) (12Dausset J. Cann H. Cohen D. Lathrop M. Lalouel J.-M. White R. Genomics. 1990; 6: 575-577Google Scholar) collection, as well as for three of the extended families including grandparents and offspring. Where available, lymphoblast cell stocks for these individuals were obtained from the NIGMS mutant cell repository (maintained by the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ) and expanded in culture as directed by the supplier. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media containing 15% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. DNA was prepared from the cultured cells using the Puregene Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (Gentra Systems, Inc.). DNA (non-CEPH) was also prepared from whole tissues, either surgical discards including human placentas, other cultured cell lines, as well as bovine liver, also by the Puregene Kit method. DNA for three extended CEPH families was provided by Dr. Michael Litt, Oregon Health Sciences University; several other DNA samples were kindly given by Mirta Machado, Shriners Hospital for Children, Portland. The primers used in the human genomic PCR assay were located at positions 2888–2911 of the human aggrecan cDNA sequence (8Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Google Scholar) for the upstream sense primer (5′-TAGAGGGCTCTGCCTCTGGAGTTG-3′), and for the downstream, antisense primer positions 4115–4092 (5′-AGGTCCCCTACCGCAGAGGTAGAA-3′). The bovine genomic PCR reaction used primers from the two published cDNA fragments (13Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Heinegard D. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 255-259Google Scholar, 14Antonsson P. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16170-16173Google Scholar); the upstream primer was located at position 1304–1324 of the 5′ bovine cDNA (14Antonsson P. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16170-16173Google Scholar) (5′-AGGTTGCCCTCTGGGGGTGAG-3′), and the downstream, antisense primer at position 57–37 of the 3′ bovine cDNA fragment (13Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Heinegard D. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 255-259Google Scholar) (5′-GGGTGCTTCTCCGCTCAGGTC-3′). The 50-μl PCR reaction typically included 50 pmol of each of the sense and antisense primers, 100 ng of genomic DNA, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2.5 units ofTaq DNA polymerase, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm potassium chloride. The annealing temperature for both the human and bovine reactions was 67 °C, and 29 cycles of amplification were carried out. PCR products were subcloned by ligation into the T-tailed vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). 2 μg of genomic DNA was cut withHaeIII and fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA in the gel was denatured, neutralized, and transferred to derivatized nylon membrane (ZetaProbe GT, Bio-Rad) by capillary action using standard methods (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.58Google Scholar). The membrane was baked for 2 h at 80 °C in a vacuum oven, pre-washed at 65 °C for 1 h in 0.1 × SSC (SSC, 0.15 m sodium chloride, 0.015m sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.5% SDS, then prehybridized and hybridized in Church buffer (0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin) at 65 °C for 16 h. The probe used was a HaeIII fragment of the cDNA clone pSA003 (8Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Google Scholar) encoding the human VNTR region. The blots were washed at 65 °C in 0.1 × SSC, 1% SDS, following a prewash at room temperature in 2 × SSC, 5% SDS. DNA size markers were co-electrophoresed and transferred and probed in the same hybridization with 32P-labeled marker DNA. DNA probes were labeled using random primer extension with Klenow and [α-32P]dCTP according to the kit manufacturer (Amersham Corp.). The two smallest alleles, 13 and 18, were sequenced after subcloning PCR-generated DNA into a T-tailed vector, using M13 sequencing primers flanking the cloning site. Cycle sequencing using Taq polymerase (ABI kit) and an ABI 383 automated DNA sequencer were used. Allele 18 was too large to sequence completely across the clone in this manner, but 15 of the 18 repeats were sequenced. The bovine VNTR product, approximately 1.6 kilobase pairs, required a nested deletion strategy, as the sequence was too repetitive for internal priming and too long to sequence across from the ends. Nested deletions in pUC18 were constructed using exonuclease III and mung bean nuclease (Stratagene kit) and sequenced as above. A PCR assay was designed to examine the size of the highly repeated region in various individuals. This strategy made use of the fact that the repeat region was part of a large exon, so that total genomic DNA could be used for analysis. Primers were chosen at positions just outside the highly repeated domain, so that the size of the product was predicted to be 33 nucleotides greater than the repeat region, which in turn was determined by the number of repeats of the 57 nucleotides encoding each 19 amino acid unit. DNA samples were obtained from a number of sources, including common cell lines and surgical discards, but the major resource used for this study was the CEPH collection's 40 founder couples. These are the founders of large, well studied families for which lymphoblast cell cultures, as well as purified DNA in some cases, are available from the NIGMS cell repository. Upon screening DNA of 72 of these unrelated individuals, as well as 22 additional samples, a range of PCR product sizes was observed. Fig. 1 displays the first 10 of these alleles that were identified and that includes the extremes of the range; three additional alleles (not shown) have been observed making a total of 13 alleles to date. Several lines of evidence support the conclusion that these PCR products arise from a polymorphic repeat region in the CS domain of aggrecan. First, the bands differ in size by a base pair count that is an integral number of the base pairs in a repeat unit, or 57 bases. In this respect, it was noted that the band derived from pSA003, the allele that was published as a cDNA sequence (8Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Google Scholar), was exactly one repeat larger than predicted. Apparently the large number of identical repeats in this sequence allowed the alignment to ""slip"" by one repeat during the computerized assembly of the random, sonicated fragment sequences in the original sequencing. This is a difficult problem to circumvent if a repeat region is long and the repeats are very similar. Second, the same pattern, adjusted for restriction siteversus primer location, was obtained by genomic Southern analysis. Total genomic DNA was digested with HaeIII, electrophoretically fractionated, blotted, and probed with the CS-repeat cDNA (Fig. 1 B). This correspondence in pattern rules out a PCR artifact in the generation of the bands. The PCR product bands can be digested appropriately with restriction enzymes (data not shown). Furthermore, upon extending the assay to several of the families of the CEPH founders (DNA kindly provided by Dr. Michael Litt, OHSU) the alleles followed a strict Mendelian assortment in all cases, in up to three generations (data not shown). Finally, as discussed below, two of the alleles have been cloned and sequenced and conclusively identified as variants of the published repeat sequence. The description and frequency of these alleles in the studied population are presented in Table I. The numbers of repeats in these 13 alleles range from 33 to 13; the allele cloned as pSA003 corresponded to 22 repeats in this assay, which includes the published 19 repeats (8Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Google Scholar), the missing ""slipped"" repeat, and two additional repeats resulting from a change in the defined start of a repeat (see below), making it one of the smaller and also less common forms of the gene. The most common alleles in the general population are those of 28, 27, or 26 repeats that make up 87% observed alleles and represent a normal distribution with a mean and mode of 27 repeats. The CEPH founders used in this study consist of 49 Utah, 17 French, 4 Venezuelan, and 2 Amish individuals; the allele distribution in the two largest groups, the Utah and French families, showed the same mean allele size, 27, but somewhat different rankings of the different alleles. Allele 26 showed the most divergence, as it was 16% in the Utah families and 35% in the French families, although this sample group is quite small. No data are yet available from other ethnic groups.Table IDistribution of human aggrecan VNTR alleles in a random populationObserved allele repeat numberPCR product sizeFrequency%bpn = 18833191510.532185831.629168742.12816304523.92715738444.72615163418.125145942.122128873.721123110.520117410.519111710.518106021.11377510.5 Open table in a new tab The generality of the VNTR phenomenon among species was examined by attempting to demonstrate its occurrence in the bovine system. The rat (5Doege K. Sasaki M. Horigan E. Hassell J.R. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17757-17767Google Scholar), mouse (16Walcz E. Deak F. Erhardt P. Coulter S.N. Fulpo C. Horvath P. Doege K.J. Glant T.T. Genomics. 1994; 22: 364-371Google Scholar), and chicken (17Li H. Schwartz N.B. Vertel B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23504-23511Google Scholar) aggrecan cDNA sequences have been reported, and although a recognizable variant of the human repeat region can be seen in all cases, the sequences are poorly conserved as a group for each species relative to the level of the human repeats. Partial bovine cDNA sequences have been published (13Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Heinegard D. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 255-259Google Scholar, 14Antonsson P. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16170-16173Google Scholar), but these non-overlapping clones do not include the CS domain sequence where the repeat region would be expected. The human and bovine sequences both share related KS hexapeptide repeats however (14Antonsson P. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16170-16173Google Scholar), suggesting the CS repeats might also be similar, at least in level of conservation. Accordingly, the bovine CS-encoding region was cloned by PCR amplification from genomic DNA, using primer sequences from the published sequence flanking the gap region. The sequence determined from this PCR clone indeed contains a series of conserved repeats similar in size and number to the human conserved region, but the degree of conservation is lower in the bovine case (Fig.2). The rat repeat region sequence is presented for comparison and shows repeats that are conserved as a group even less well than the bovine. It is possibly due to this lower degree of sequence conservation that there has been no detectable polymorphism in approximately 20 bovine genomic DNA samples that have been examined by PCR (data not shown). These samples were obtained from different breeds and geographical regions in an effort to overcome the effects of agricultural inbreeding, but it may be that cattle from sufficiently isolated or distantly removed populations would still show some variation at this locus. At least it can be said that the repeated region in bovine is not polymorphic for the practical purpose of serving as an experimental system. Concurrently with this work, a bovine aggrecan cDNA clone encoding the CS domain was obtained in similar fashion by another group and sequenced, and the repeat region in that clone appears virtually identical to that reported here. 2Dr. Tom Hering, Case Western Reserve University, personal communication. This sequence is now available in GenBank (accession number U76615). The two shortest human alleles, 13 and 18, were cloned and sequenced, and the repeat structure compared with the previously sequenced allele 22 (Fig. 3). This comparison confirms that these alleles result from varying numbers of repeats and not from interpolation of some other sequence or amplification of some other unrelated sequence. The fine structure of these repeats can be examined because the near-identical repeats do show some variation, particularly in the penultimate codon, which may encode either threonine or alanine (Fig.2). Even where the amino acid sequences are identical, types of repeats can be distinguished by a third-base change in codon 17 of the 19-codon repeat, permitting four classes of repeats to be distinguished on the basis of these two adjacent codons: ACC ACT, ACC GCT, ACT GCT, and ACT ACT. On this basis, alleles 13 and 18 are rather similar, differing primarily by an expansion of the number of type III repeats in allele 18. It should be noted that three repeats in the middle of allele 18 could not be conclusively identified, due to the technical difficulties of sequencing such repeated regions; a deletion strategy will be required to sequence the longer alleles. Allele 22 shows several changes in the repeat pattern, including an expansion of type I repeats, a loss of type III repeats, and the introduction of a large body of type II repeats, not seen in the other two alleles. Allele 22 harbors one repeat that was not originally sequenced and has still not been determined. This unknown repeat is arbitrarily placed between the blocks of II and III repeats because it is most likely to be one of these types. Additionally, there are a few other changes in these repeats, shown boxed in Fig. 3, that may have arisen either by complex shuffling of repeat types or by point mutation within a block of repeats. VNTR polymorphisms, or hypervariable minisatellite regions, are extremely valuable tools in linkage analysis, providing high levels of heterozygosity (18Jeffreys A.J. Wilson V. Thein S.L. Nature. 1985; 314: 67-73Google Scholar). These loci are polymorphic by virtue of different numbers of conserved repeat sequences, probably generated by unequal crossing over during mitosis or meiosis (19Jeffreys A.J. Royle N.J. Wilson V. Wong Z. Nature. 1988; 332: 278-281Google Scholar). The polymorphic nature is correlated with degree of repeat conservation (18Jeffreys A.J. Wilson V. Thein S.L. Nature. 1985; 314: 67-73Google Scholar). These minisatellites almost always are associated with non-coding regions in the genome; the only exceptions previously reported are members of the mucin family (20Gum Jr., J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 557-564Google Scholar) and, recently, the p57KIP2 gene (21Tokino T. Urano T. Furuhata T. Matsushima M. Miyatsu T. Sasaki S. Nakamura Y. Hum. Genet. 1996; 97: 625-631Google Scholar). Mucins share several features with proteoglycans, including long stretches of repetitive sequence used for carbohydrate attachment; there is no similarity in these sequences however between mucins and aggrecan. One such mucin, the human epithelial mucin cloned from breast and pancreatic tumor cells (22Gendler S.J. Lancaster C.A. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Duhig T. Peat N. Burchell J. Pemberton L. Lalani E.-N. Wilson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15286-15293Google Scholar), consists of 20 to 100 repeats of a 20-amino acid sequence. This range in repeat number is much greater than seen in the aggrecan expressed VNTR repeats; the number of different alleles is also much higher for this mucin. The functional consequences of the length variation has not been explored for the mucins, and in fact the properties of mucins may be rather insensitive to variations in mucin core protein lengths. The p57KIP2 gene, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase, has a proline-alanine repeat domain of 40 hexanucleotide repeats, which are polymorphic in that 7–15% of individuals have 12-nucleotide deletions. The GC-rich character of these short repeats recalls the triplet repeat type of mutations (23Caskey C.T. Pizzuti A. Fu Y.-H. Fenwick Jr., R.G. Nelson D. Science. 1992; 256: 784-789Google Scholar). There are numerous cases of variation in numbers of repeated sequences in related proteins, and perhaps not surprisingly these are often carbohydrate-bearing domains. These variants occur in different members of multigene families, as for the trout apo-polysialoglycoproteins (24Sorimachi Y. Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Suzuki K. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17678-17684Google Scholar), or as evolutionary variants in closely related species, as for the involucrin gene (25Djian P. Green H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5321-5325Google Scholar). These examples may indicate tolerance for such core protein length variation but may also reflect compensatory changes in other tissue components. The aggrecan gene variation is unique, as the variation in repeats occurs at a polymorphic locus within a single population, as for mucins; yet unlike mucins the molecule is a primary functional component of a stable tissue, interacts with several other components of that tissue, and may contribute to a subtle tissue architecture, in addition to its bulk properties. There are two major aspects that may be affected by this variation in aggrecan repeat length (Fig. 4). Most obvious is the chondroitin-sulfate content. Each repeat contains two possible attachment points for CS, so that extreme range alleles 33 and 13 might vary by as many as 40 CS chains per core protein monomer. It is not known whether all serine-glycine pairs in the molecule are equally likely to receive CS chains, but if full substitution is assumed, there would be a range of 172 to 132 CS chains between these two alleles, respectively, representing a 30% variation. It is not clear what the consequences of such a difference in GAG content might mean functionally for cartilage, assuming all other variables in this complex system are unchanged; it is of course possible that chain length or percentage of sites substituted may differ in these individuals and thus compensate for acceptor site number. Differences in sulfation produce profound changes in cartilage, as seen in the brachymorphic mouse (26Orkin R.W. Pratt R.M. Martin G.R. Dev. Biol. 1976; 50: 82-94Google Scholar), and the recently identified diastrophic dysplasia gene as a sulfate transporter (27Hastbacka J. De la Chapelle A. Mahtani M.M. Clines G. Reeve-Daly M.P. Daly M. Hamilton B.A. Kusumi K. Trivedi B. Weaver A. Coloma A. Lovett M. Buckler A. Kaitila I. Lander E.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 1073-1087Google Scholar). The chondroitin sulfate chains of aggrecan undergo changes in size and number with aging, and these changes have been implicated in the onset of osteoarthritis (28Hardingham T. Bayliss M. Semin. Arthritis Rheum. 1990; 20: 12-33Google Scholar). It is possible that individuals expressing extreme repeat number alleles for the aggrecan expressed VNTR possess cartilage with unusual physical properties or that may show compensatory changes in aggrecan expression level, CS chain length, CS attachment site utilization, or sulfation pattern. The length of the core protein varies directly with repeat number, and this length variation also may lead to changes in cartilage function. The CS-bearing part of aggrecan is thought to attain an extended rod-like structure, so that more repeats should correlate with a longer core protein. The range in the CS domain would be 1538 to 1158 amino acids (allele 33 to allele 13), of which 589 to 209 are in the CS repeat domain; this range predicts a CS region length difference of 33%. This difference in core protein length may affect some critical spacing or packing aspects of cartilage. Aggrecan is anchored at the amino terminus by the hyaluronan/link protein binding of the G1 domain, but the carboxyl-terminal G3 domain also is likely to be involved in binding to some component of cartilage. The G3 domain of aggrecan has been shown to have lectin-like activity (29Halberg D.F. Proulx G. Doege K. Yamada Y. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9486-9490Google Scholar), and the similar domain of the related aggrecan family member versican has been reported to bind a variety of matrix molecules, most notably tenascin-R (30Aspberg A. Binkert C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10590-10594Google Scholar) and heparin sulfate (31Ujita M. Shinomura T. Ito K. Kitagawa Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27603-27609Google Scholar). While the GAG attachment domain of versican does not show the same type of conserved repeat sequence as aggrecan and is unlikely to vary in repeat number, it does undergo alternative splicing, producing molecules with varied spacing between G1 and G3 domains (32Ito K. Shinomura T. Zako M. Ujita M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 270: 958-965Google Scholar,33Naso M.F. Zimmermann D.R. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32999-33008Google Scholar). Variation in spacing between binding domains might be expected to have disruptive effects on tissue architecture, if the ligands are relatively fixed in position. Such disruption might be greater if two alleles are expressed together in the tissue; it is currently not known if both alleles of an individual heterozygous for aggrecan are expressed together and/or at an equal level in cartilage. The structure of the proteins expressed from these various polymorphic alleles has not been investigated; different alleles must be expressed in different individuals, however, as several alleles have been observed in the homozygous condition; these include alleles 28, 27, 26, and 22 (data not shown). The low frequency of most of the alleles (Table I) is probably the reason that homozygous individuals for the extreme forms of the gene have not been observed; it is also likely that other allelic forms exist in the population and would be observed in a larger sampling. We have analyzed the allelic distribution pattern for this gene in an independent population similar in size to that reported here, with very similar observed frequencies of these same alleles. 3W. E. Horton, Jr., R. Balakir, P. Precht, C. Plato, J. D. Tobin, M. Lethbridge-Cejku, L. Meek, and K. Doege, submitted for publication. There are numerous unanswered questions about the expression of such alleles, including whether both alleles in a heterozygote are expressed, whether both appear in equivalent amount and pattern in the matrix, as well as the questions regarding the glycosaminoglycan components raised above. Since these alleles occur widely in the population, the effects of the polymorphisms are obviously tolerated, and any proposed consequences would fall by necessity within the range of functional parameters seen in the population. One such potential consequence of different alleles might be a subtle variation in cartilage function affecting the resistance of an individual's articular cartilage to the onset of joint degeneration or osteoarthritis. These conditions occur widely with aging but to different degrees of severity and ages of onset in the population. The etiology of these disorders is undoubtedly complex and is under intense investigation, but a genetic component is suspected in families with early onset osteoarthritis, and in some cases has been demonstrated (see Ref. 34Jimenez S.A. Dharmavaram R.M. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1994; 53: 789-797Google Scholar, and references therein). In such a widespread disease, the type of variation seen at the polymorphic aggrecan locus may provide an explanation for cartilage with a common but subtle reduction in functionality. Support for this hypothesis has recently been obtained in a population study linking one of the aggrecan VNTR alleles to bilateral hand osteoarthritis.3 It is perhaps surprising that this type of aggrecan polymorphism only appears in humans, of the species so far examined. The occurrence of the polymorphism in other species has only been directly tested in cows, but the level of conservation of the repeats is insufficient in other species to support unequal crossing over and generation of different repeat numbers. The polymorphism depends on a high degree of sequence conservation, leading to the question of why the sequences are so highly conserved in humans alone of the species so far examined. The actual repeat sequence is somewhat different in the various species (Fig. 2). The human repeat is unique in conserving the two closely spaced serine-glycine pairs in the middle of the repeat; the bovine and rat repeats have lost one of the middle serine-glycine pairs in favor of an additional one at the beginning, which is uniformly a proline-glycine pair in human repeats. Until more is known about the utilization of particular serine-glycine pairs as CS acceptor sequences, as well as details of cartilage ultrastructure, it is difficult to speculate on the consequences of these different repeat structures. Sequencing of the three shortest alleles confirms that they have aris",https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.272.21.13974,0

A 247-bp region of the wheat D-genome Xwye838 locus, encoding ADP-glucopyrophosphorylase, and a 326-bp region of the wheat D-genome Gss locus, encoding granule-bound starch synthase, were sequenced in a total 564 lines of hexaploid wheat (T. aestivum, genome AABBDD) involving all its subspecies and 203 lines of Aegilops tauschii, the diploid source of the wheat D genome. In Ae. tauschii, two SNP variants were detected at the Xwye838 locus and 11 haplotypes at the Gss locus. Two haplotypes with contrasting frequencies were found at each locus in wheat. Both wheat Xwye838 variants, but only one of the Gss haplotypes seen in wheat, were found among the Ae. tauschii lines. The other wheat Gss haplotype was not found in either Ae. tauschii or 70 lines of tetraploid Ae. cylindrica (genomes CCDD), which is known to hybridize with wheat. It is concluded that both T. aestivum and Ae. cylindrica originated recurrently, with at least two genetically distinct progenitors contributing to the formation of the D genome in both species.",https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.103.016303,0
134,A M55V Polymorphism in a Novel SUMO Gene (SUMO-4) Differentially Activates Heat Shock Transcription Factors and Is Associated with Susceptibility to Type I Diabetes Mellitus,"Three SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) genes have been identified in humans, which tag proteins to modulate subcellular localization and/or enhance protein stability and activity. We report the identification of a novel intronless SUMO gene, SUMO-4, that encodes a 95-amino acid protein having an 86% amino acid homology with SUMO-2. In contrast to SUMO-2, which is highly expressed in all of the tissues examined, SUMO-4 mRNA was detected mainly in the kidney. A single nucleotide polymorphism was detected in SUMO-4, substituting a highly conserved methionine with a valine residue (M55V). In HepG2 (liver carcinoma) cells transiently transfected with SUMO-4 expression vectors, Met-55 was associated with the elevated levels of activated heat shock factor transcription factors as compared with Val-55, whereas the levels of NF-κB were suppressed to an identical degree. The SUMO-4M (Met) variant is associated with type I diabetes mellitus susceptibility in families (p = 4.0 × 10-4), suggesting that it may be involved in the pathogenesis of type I diabetes.

Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2001; 2: 202-210Google Scholar). SUMO-1 is related to ubiquitin, and although both share only an 18% sequence homology, they have a similar three-dimensional structure (1Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2001; 2: 202-210Google Scholar). In contrast to ubiquitin, which tags proteins for degradation, SUMO-1 seems to enhance protein stability and modulate the subcellular localization. The list of mammalian proteins, which are known to be sumoylated, is growing continually and includes RAN GTPase-activating protein 1 (nuclear import) (2Saitoh H. Pu R. Cavenagh M. Dasso M. Proc.

A C-terminal proteolytic event exposes two glycine residues at the C terminus that are involved in the formation of a peptide bond with the ϵ-amino group of a lysine residue of a target protein. The activating enzymes E1 (AOS1 and UBA2) and the conjugating enzyme E2 (UBC9) are required for sumoylation in vitro (1Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2001; 2: 202-210Google Scholar). In vivo, an additional enzyme E3 is required for efficient sumoylation (9Kagey M.H. Melhusih T.A. Wotton D. Cell. 2003; 113: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The E2 enzyme, UBC9, is specific for sumoylation, and recently, two additional SUMO family members have been identified based on the interaction with UBC9, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3 (10Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 11Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M.P. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). SUMO-1 shares a 48% identity with SUMO-2 and a 46% with SUMO-3. Very little is known regarding the functions of SUMO-2 and SUMO-3. However, SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 contain a consensus SUMO modification site (Fig. 1), which enables self-sumoylation and the formation of polymeric chains (11Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A.

Thus, SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 may have different roles in cellular functions. Here, we identify and characterize a novel fourth SUMO gene (SUMO-4) whose protein product is 87% homologous with SUMO-2 and report a unique polymorphism not encoded in any of the other SUMO genes (M55V). The SUMO-4M (Met variant) activates HSFs to a larger extent and is associated with susceptibility to type I diabetes (p = 4.0 × 10-4). SUMO-4M may be involved in the pathogenesis of type I diabetes. RT-PCR—Total RNA was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX), and RT-PCR performed using the Omniscript RT-PCR kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Total RNA (0.5 μg) was analyzed in the first strand reverse transcriptase reaction using a primer that includes poly(dT19)-CATTTTAAAC found in SUMO-2 mRNA and deduced from the poly(A) site in SUMO-4 genomic DNA by following directions from Qiagen. The primer was removed from the reaction mixture by purification using a Cycle-Pure kit from Omega Bio-Tek (Doraville, GA). The purified cDNA (10 μl to one-third of the total) was amplified in 25 μl of PCR reactions containing dNTPs, 1.25 m betaine (Sigma), and primers for SUMO-4F1 (forward) (5′-GCAATATGCTTGTGTACACATAC-3′) and either SUMO-4R1 (reverse) (5′-CACAGAAGAAGTCAAGACTGAG-3′) or SUMO-2R1 (5′-CAAGGAAGGAGTCAAGACTGA-3′). The PCR reaction was “hot-started” by adding Taq polymerase (PGC Scientific, Gaithersburg, MD) at 95 °C. The SUMO-2R1 and SUMO-4R1 primers have three mismatches, which were sufficient to obtain allele-specific PCR using the conditions described. After 35 cycles of PCR using an annealing temperature of 55 °C, 5 μl of the PCR product was analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel to identify the expected 466-bp DNA fragments. Control experiments were performed in which equivalent amounts of RNA were amplified without the prior reverse transcriptase step to demonstrate that RT-PCR products were generated from RNA and not from contaminating DNA. Nucleotide sequence analysis at our Child Health Research Center Sequencing Core at Baylor College of Medicine was used to confirm the specificities of the SUMO-2 and SUMO-4 RT-PCR products, respectively. Genotyping—Genotyping was done using a 3-step primer extension assay (12Devaney J.M. Pettit E L. Daler S.G. Vallone P.M. Butler J.M. Marino M.A. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). First, a defined region was amplified using 30 cycles of PCR consisting of 1 min at 94 °C (denaturation), 1 min at 55 °C (annealing), and 1 min at 72 °C (extension). PCR using SUMO-4F1 and SUMO-R2 primers (see RT-PCR above) resulted in a PCR product of 466 bp. In the next step, dNTPs and primers remaining from the PCR were removed by enzymatic digestion using shrimp alkaline phosphatase and exonuclease I (each from Amersham Biosciences). In the final step, the single base extension (SBE) reaction using an oligonucleotide primer resides directly adjacent to the nucleotide in question. The SBE primer was 5′-GAACCACGGGGATTGTCA-3′. The SBE reaction contained the extension primer, all four dideoxy dNTPs (Amersham Biosciences), Taq polymerase, and the purified PCR product. The SBE assay was done using 49 cycles of denaturation at 96 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 60 °C for 30 s. After the SBE primer was extended with the nucleotide analogue, the resulting products were analyzed using ion-pair reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography with the WAVE System (Transgenomic, Inc., Omaha, NE). Recombinant Clones—Vectors pHSE-Luc, pNF-κB-Luc, pTAL-Luc, and pCMV-Myc were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Renilla luciferase reporter phRL-null vector was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI), and HSF2 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). pET-15b vector was purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). SUMO-1, SUMO-2, SUMO-3, SUMO-4M, and SUMO-4V constructs were made to express active recombinant proteins ending in the terminal di-glycine residues (Fig. 1, additional C-terminal residues are cleaved normally in vivo). UBC9 was made to the full-length protein. All of the recombinant proteins were expressed in pET-15b vector. This vector allows the expression of recombinant proteins containing a His tag at the N terminus of the recombinant protein. The recombinant proteins were propagated in BL21(DE3)-transformed cells, and recombinant proteins were purified utilizing the His-bind resin (Ni2+) as described by the manufacturer (Novagen). Purified proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, with the exception of SUMO-4, which was dialyzed against 25 mm MES, pH 6.0, and 75 mm NaCl. The sequence of all of the recombinant clones was verified by nucleotide sequence analysis. RT-PCR from 293 human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells (Ambion) was used as a source of RNA to make cDNA in all of the constructs. The HEK cells are heterozygous and express mRNA for both SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V. For SUMO-4, the primer SUMO-4F2-GCCATATGGCCAACGAAAAGCC containing a NdeI site and primer SUMO-4R2-TCAACCTCCCGTAGGCTGTTG, which terminates the SUMO-4 amino acid sequence by two amino acids, were utilized. The RT-PCR products were ligated into TA-cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and transformed into XL1-Blue Escherichia coli cells. A 328-bp restriction endonuclease fragment created by the digestion of recombinant clones with the restriction endonucleases, NdeI (site in primer) and BamHI (site in vector), was subcloned into the NdeI/BamHI site of pET-15b. RT-PCR products of SUMO-2 were made using primers SUMO-2F2-GCCATATGGCCGACGAAAAGCC (NdeI site in primer) and SUMO-2R2-CCGGATCCTCAACCTCCCGTCTGCT (BamHI site in primer) and were ligated into pCR2.1. A NdeI/BamHI restriction endonuclease fragment from recombinant SUMO-2/pCR2.1 was subcloned into the NdeI/BamHI site of pET-15b. UBC9, SUMO-1, and SUMO-3 cDNA were made by RT-PCR using primers that did not contain NdeI or BamHI restriction endonuclease sites: UBC9F1-CGAGGGACTTTGAACATGTC; UBC9R1-CTGCGATGCCACAAGGT; SUMO-1F-GGTGAAGCCACCGTCATC; SUMO-1R-GAATATCTAAACTGTTGAATGACCC; SUMO-3F-CGCTCGGAAGCCATGT; and SUMO-3R-CTGCCAGGCTGCTCTCCG. An aliquot of the above reactions was re-amplified by PCR using primers containing NdeI and BamHI sites: UBC9F2-CGAGGGACTTTGCATATGTC; UBC9-R2-CAAGGTGGATCCTTATGAGG; SUMO-1F2-CCA-CCGTCCATATGTCTGACCAG; SUMO-1R2-AAAGAATATCGGATCCGTTGACTAACCCCCC; SUMO-3F2-CGCTCGGAACATATGTCCG; and SUMO-3-R2-CAGGCTGGGATCCGGCTAACCTCC. The secondary PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and were subcloned directly into the NdeI/BamHI site of pET-15b. For subcloning into a mammalian expression vector, pCMV-Myc (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), the recombinant SUMO-4/pET vectors were altered by 3 nucleotide changes to create a EcoRI site, in-frame with the first Met of both SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit utilizing PfuTurbo DNA polymerase and primers 5′-GTGCCGCGCGGAATTCATATG-3′ and its reverse complement were used per the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). An EcoRI/BamHI double digest resulted in a restriction endonuclease fragment, which was subcloned into the EcoRI/BglII sites of pCMV-Myc. HSF2 plasmid was amplified with primers HSF2NDEF-CGCCGCGTTACATATGAAGCAGAG and HSF2BAMR-CTGTTTTATCGGATCCTTCTGAGCAC, which resulted in a 410-bp PCR product containing NdeI and BamHI sites and included the complete DNA-binding domain (DBD) of HSF2. After digestion with NdeI and BamHI, the sequence was sub-cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET-15b. The recombinant HSF2-DBD/pET vector was altered to create a EcoRI site, in-frame with the first Met of HSF2, and the EcoRI/BamHI restriction endonuclease fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI/BglII sites of pCMV-Myc as described above and is called pCMV-Myc-HSF2-DBD82K. The lysine 82 was mutated to arginine using the primer 5′-GACTCTGGAATTGTAAGGCAAGAAAGAGATG-3′ and its reverse complement as described above and is called pCMV-Myc-HSF2-DBD82R. Antibodies—The SUMO-4-specific antibodies were prepared by the following protocol. The antiserum was made in rabbits immunized with the peptide-CEPRGLSVKQIRFRFG (SUMO-4V) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin carrier protein through the N-terminal Cys of the peptide (Sigma Genosys). The IgG fraction of the antiserum (4 ml/run) was purified using the Ag antibody purification kit from Pierce. SUMO-2 peptide-CERQGLSMRQIRFRFD made by Sigma Genosys was bound to Sepharose using the Sulfolink kit from Pierce (Rockford, IL). The IgG was fractionated over the SUMO-2 peptide column using the Pierce protocol and was tested for specificity against recombinant proteins for SUMO-1, SUMO-2, SUMO-3, SUMO-4M, and SUMO-4V by Western blotting. The SUMO-4 antibody was used at a dilution of 1:1000 and detected only SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V at approximately equal signal intensities. Monoclonal antibody for c-Myc (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used at a 1:2000 dilution. Transfections—HepG2 were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were seeded into 6-well plates and grown for 24 h. The cells were transfected at ∼75% confluency with 20 μg of DNA/well of pCMV-Myc-SUMO-4 constructs using a standard calcium phosphate protocol (13Barski O.A. Gabbay K.H. Bohren K.M. Genomics. 1999; 60: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After 6 h, the cells were shocked in 15% glycerol for 90 s and allowed to recover in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. After a 48-h incubation, the wells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped and the cells were concentrated by centrifugation. Nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described previously (14Timchenko N. Wilson D.R. Taylor L.R. Abdelsayed S. Wilde M. Sawadogo M. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1192-120213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pellet was suspended in buffer 1 (200 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT) for 30 min, cells were lysed by passage through a 22-guage needle, and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant (cytoplasmic extract) was stored at -20 °C, and the nuclei were suspended in buffer 2 (50 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 25% sucrose, 400 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT) for 60 min. The nuclear extract was recovered from the supernatant after centrifugation and stored at -20 °C. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay as described by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). 20 μg of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using c-Myc primary antibody. For co-transfections of pCMV-Myc-SUMO-4/pCMV-Myc-DBD-HSF2 constructs, 1 μg of each plasmid was transfected in 24-well plates as described above and whole cell extracts (WCEs) were made by dissolving the cells directly into 100 μl of 1× NuPAGE lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer containing reducing agent (Invitrogen). 20 μl of WCE was analyzed by Western blotting using the c-Myc primary antibody. Western Blotting—Nuclear, cytoplasmic, or WCEs were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE) and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk and probed with primary antibodies followed by anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase or anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Bands were visualized using ECL chemiluminescent kit (Amersham Biosciences) and autoradiography (Kodak X-Omat AR film). Luciferase Assay—Transfections for luciferase reporter assays were done as described above using 2.2 μg of transfected DNA in 24-well plates. The amount of DNA transfected was 1 μg of test plasmid (either the SUMO-4M or SUMO-4V construct or the control pCMV-Myc lacking the SUMO-4 sequences), 1 μg of either firefly luciferase reporter vector (pHSE-Luc or pNF-κB-Luc) or the pTAL-Luc control vector lacking any response element, and 0.2 μg of Renilla vector. The Renilla vector (phRL-null) served as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Dual-luciferase assays were done using a kit from Promega (Madison, WI) as described previously (13Barski O.A. Gabbay K.H. Bohren K.M. Genomics. 1999; 60: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The amount of firefly luciferase activity was normalized to that of the control Renilla luciferase activity. To determine the specific effect of the heat shock element (HSE) and NF-κB response elements without SUMO-4 overexpression in HepG2 cells, the combination of pCMV-Myc control/pTAL-Luc/phRL-null vector was transfected to determine background luciferase activity. The combination of pCMV-Myc control/pHSE-Luc/phRL-null or pCMV-Myc control/pNF-κB-Luc/phRL-null were transfected next into HepG2 cells, and the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase was compared with the background levels determined above. This comparison provided a relative amount of active transcription factors in the resting HepG2 cells that could bind to the HSE or NF-κB response elements, respectively. SUMO-4M or SUMO-4V/pHSE-Luc or pNF-κB-luc/phRL-null combinations were transfected into HepG2 cells to determine the effect of SUMO-4M or SUMO-4V overexpression on the specific response elements. The effect of overexpression of SUMO-4 on reporter gene expression was compared with the levels of reporter expression lacking SUMO-4 calculated above. To study the effect of oxidative stress, H2O2 (Sigma) was added to media to a final concentration of 2 or 4 mm during the final 18 h of transfection. 4–8 transfections were done for each combination of constructs, and the results were plotted as the mean ± S.E. The student's t test was used to determine the significance of the findings. In Vitro Sumoylation Assay—HepG2 cells (∼3 × 105) were concentrated by centrifugation and suspended in 100 μl of solution 3 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 1% Triton X-100) (14Timchenko N. Wilson D.R. Taylor L.R. Abdelsayed S. Wilde M. Sawadogo M. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1192-120213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 5 min of incubation on ice, the lysed cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 rpm and the supernatant was collected. The whole cell extract was used in the in vitro sumoylation assay. Formation of the thioester adducts between the recombinant E2 enzyme UBC9 and SUMO-4M or SUMO-4V was initiated essentially as described previously (15Desterro J.M.P. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Reactions contained whole cell extracts from HepG2 (7 μg), and recombinant SUMO-4M or SUMO-4V (2 μg) and UBC9 (5 μg) were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, and 2 mm DTT (30 μl of total reaction volume). Control reactions lacking recombinant UBC9 or including 100 mm DTT also were prepared. Reactions were incubated for 90 min at 30 °C and then stopped by adding 5 μl of NuPAGE lithium dodecyl sulfate buffer and heated to 100 °C for 4 min. Samples (15 μl) were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and analyzed by Western blotting using SUMO-4-specific primary and anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies as described above. Genetic Analyses—The chromosome 6q25 region has been shown to be associated with type I diabetes susceptibility (IDDM5) by linkage studies (16Cox N.J. Wapelhorst B. Morrison V.A. Johnson L. Pinchuk L. Spielman R.S. Todd J.A. Concannon P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 820-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). SUMO-4 is located in this region. The Tsp test (17Martin E.R. Kaplan N.L. Weir B.S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) was used to access linkage disequilibrium between the SUMO-4 marker alleles and disease, because this test provides a valid χ2 test for linkage disequilibrium in the presence of linkage. Tsp examines whether a heterozygous parent transmits the same or different marker alleles to each of their affected children (sibling pairs). Tissue Specificity of an mRNA Encoded by a Novel SUMO Gene on Chromosome 6q25—A SUMO-related nucleotide sequence is located within intron 6 of the TAB2 (mitogen-activating protein kinase kinase kinase 7-interacting protein-2, MAPK7IP2) gene on chromosome 6q25 (TAB2 DNA NCBI accession number AL031133 and smt3-like protein NCBI accession number CAA20019). In contrast to SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3, the SUMO-related DNA sequence does not contain any introns; however, it contains an open reading frame of 95 amino acids, a putative polyadenylation site, and a consensus ribosome-binding site (Kozak sequence) for correct translation initiation. Moreover, the predicted amino acid sequence is similar to that of SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3 with the largest sequence homology to SUMO-2 (Fig. 1, 87% amino acid homology). We have named this “putative” protein SUMO-4 based on the strong sequence homologies. To determine whether an mRNA specific to SUMO-4 is expressed, we performed RT-PCR from total RNA of various tissues. In contrast to SUMO-2, which is highly expressed in all of the tissues examined, SUMO-4 mRNA was detected mainly in kidney and HEK cells (Fig. 2). A nucleotide sequence analysis of the RT-PCR products confirmed their identities as SUMO-2 and SUMO-4, respectively. Amino Acid Polymorphism in SUMO-4 —A SNP was identified previously in this gene (rs237025, chromosome 6 position 149656820; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The C/T polymorphism is in the antisense strand and encodes methionine 55 (ATG) and valine 55 (GTG), respectively. Indeed, DNA isolated from HEK cells is heterozygous for the A/G DNA polymorphism. To determine the frequency of the SNP, we typed 115 unrelated Caucasian individuals. The allele frequencies of A and G were 0.49 and 0.51, respectively. Met-55 is conserved in SUMO 1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3 proteins in humans (Fig. 1) as well as in SUMO-related sequences in the following organisms: mouse; Xenopus; Drosophila, and yeast (18Su H.-L Li S.S.L. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 296: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The high degree of conservation of Met-55 between SUMO proteins within humans and among different species suggests that the M55V substitution may affect the structure and function of SUMO proteins. In Vitro Sumoylation—To determine whether SUMO-4 utilizes the E2 enzyme, UBC9, we tested recombinant SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V proteins in an in vitro sumoylation assay containing whole cell extract from HepG2 cells containing or lacking recombinant UBC9 (Fig. 3, lanes 1–6). High molecular weight (HMW) bands with molecular masses greater than 60 kDa were identified in Western blots for both SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V proteins (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 4, respectively) but were absent when recombinant UBC9 was omitted from the reaction (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 5). The HMW bands were also absent when recombinant UBC9 plus 100 mm DTT was present (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 6). DTT (100 mm) inhibits the formation of the thioester bonds and therefore provides additional evidence that the HMW bands are the result of sumoylation (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 4). UBC9-dependent SUMO-4 bands of 26 and 33 kDa are also present but in relatively lesser quantities than the HMW bands (Fig. 3, lane 1 and very weak in lane 4). These complexes are of the correct size for a SUMO-4 dimer and a SUMO-4·UBC9 complex, respectively (Fig. 3). Transfection Studies in HepG2 Cells—To test SUMO-4 overexpression in vivo, we used SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V constructs tagged with c-Myc in mammalian expression vectors containing the CMV promoter that were transfected into HepG2 cells (Fig. 3, lanes 7–10). In cytoplasmic extracts prepared from SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V transfections, most of the protein detected in Western blots was unconjugated free SUMO-4 (Fig. 3, lanes 8 and 10). In contrast, nuclear extracts from these experiments demonstrated mostly multiple bands greater than 50 kDa (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 9). These results suggest that SUMO-4 targets multiple proteins, and these are found primarily in the nucleus. Furthermore, the SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V expression products detected by the c-Myc tag appear to be equally present in the HepG2 cells (Fig. 3, lanes 7–10), demonstrating that the most abundant sumoylated proteins in HepG2 cells are not sumoylated differentially by the Met and Val variants. To characterize a specific substrate, we tested lysine 82 located in the DBD of HSF2, which is known to be sumoylated with SUMO-1 in vitro (7Goodson M. Hong Y. Rogers R. Matunis J. Park-Sarge O.-K. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18513-18518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), for sumoylation with SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V. SUMO-4M or SUMO-4V and either pCMV-Myc-HSF2-DBD82K (lysine-normal) or pCMV-Myc-HSF2-DBD82R (arginine-mutant) were co-transfected into HepG2 cells, and the WCE was analyzed by Western blotting with a c-Myc antibody (Fig. 4). Both DBD82K (Fig. 4, lane 5) and DBD82R (Fig. 4, lane 6) were expressed as 20-kDa proteins in HepG2 cells, whereas free SUMO-4 is expressed as a 12-kDa protein (Fig. 4, lanes 3 (Met) and 4 (Val)). A small amount of SUMO-4 is conjugated to HMW (100,000) HepG2 proteins (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). However, in co-transfection experiments, DBD82K (Fig. 4, lanes 1 (Met) and 2 (Val)) was sumoylated, whereas DBD82R (Fig. 4, lanes 7 (Met) and 8 (Val)) was not. These results confirm a single sumoylation site in the DBD of HSF2 at lysine 82 (7Goodson M. Hong Y. Rogers R. Matunis J. Park-Sarge O.-K. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18513-18518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, the major sumoylated species was not 32 but was 44 kDa, whereas minor sumoylated products were detected at 32 and 56 kDa (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). These results suggest that the DBD·SUMO-4 complexes have 1–3 copies of SUMO-4 and one copy of DBD82K. Indeed, SUMO-4 has a consensus sumoylation site, VKTE, located at amino acids 10–13 (Fig. 1), and thus, our results are consistent with SUMO-4 forming polymeric SUMO side chains. The degree of sumoylation of DBD82K with SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V was not different (Fig. 4, lane 1 versus 2 and data not shown). To determine whether SUMO-4 overexpression had a biological effect in the HepG2 cells, luciferase reporter constructs containing or lacking multiple copies of HSE or NF-κB binding elements were utilized in co-transfection experiments. These two response elements were selected because IκBα, HSF1, and HSF2 are known targets of sumoylation by SUMO-1 (3Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 6Hong Y. Rogers R. Matunis J. Mayhew C.N. Goodson M. Park-Sarge O.-K. Sarge K.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 18513-18518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). IκBα sumoylation inhibits NF-κB activity, whereas HSF1 and HSF2 sumoylation is required for the transcription factors to efficiently bind to and activate the HSE elements. The transfection of SUMO-4M activated the expression from the HSE elements (Fig. 5, lane 4 versus 5; p = 3.6 × 10-5) while suppressing activation from the NF-κB elements by ∼32% (Fig. 5, lane 1 versus 2; p = 3.7 × 10-4). Transfection of SUMO-4V also activated the expression from the HSE elements (Fig. 5, lane 4 versus 6; p = 0.002); however, the increase was significantly less compared with SUMO-4M (Fig. 4, 2.8-versus 4.2-fold, lane 6 versus 5; p = 0.004). Likewise, the transfection of SUMO-4V suppressed NF-κB activation (Fig. 5, lane 1 versus 3; p = 7.4 × 10-4); however, the suppression was the same for SUMO-4M compared with SUMO-4V (Fig. 5, lane 2 versus 3; p = not significant). In transfection studies of HepG2 cells under basal conditions (Fig. 5, lane 4), endogenous HSFs were not active (relative luciferase levels of ∼1) but were activated 4.2- and 2.8-fold when transfected with SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V, respectively (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and 6). To test the effect of oxidative stress on HSF activation, HepG2 cells were treated with 2 or 4 mm H2O2 for 18 h. Endogenous HSFs were activated 2.1- and 8.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 4). At 2 mm H2O2, the transfection of SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V both increased the amount of HSF reporter levels (Fig. 6, lane 1 versus 2, 5.7-fold activation, p = 0.0004; lane 1 versus 3, 4.2-fold activation, p = 0.002), and the levels were higher for SUMO-4M than they were for SUMO-4V (Fig. 6, lane 2 versus 3; p = 0.0008). At 4 mm H2O2, SUMO-4M increased reporter levels (Fig. 6, lane 4 versus 5, 8.5–13.5-fold activation; p = 0.04) and SUMO-4V levels were intermediate (Fig. 6, lane 6, 10.4-fold activation); however, the SUMO-4V activation was not statistically different compared with either 4 mm H2O2 alone or SUMO-4M (Fig. 6, lanes 4 versus 6 and 5 versus 6, respectively). Association of SUMO-4M with Susceptibility to Type I Diabetes Mellitus—Studies have shown the linkage of markers on chromosome 6q25 (IDDM5) with susceptibility to type I diabetes mellitus (16Cox N.J.

135,Color polymorphism and sex ratio distortion in a cichlid fish as an incipient stage in sympatric speciation by sexual selection,"We investigated a Lake Victoria cichlid with a complex colour polymorphism that apparently represents one original species and two incipient species, all of which are sympatric. In laboratory breeding experiments we observed sex ratio distortion in certain matings between original and incipient species. Mate choice experiments show that males of the incipient species exhibit mating preferences against the original species, and males and females of the original species exhibit strong mating preferences against the incipient species. Mating preferences might evolve by sex ratio selection to avoid matings with distorted progeny sex ratios. Phenotype frequencies in nature suggest that mating preferences translate into mating frequencies, thus restricting gene flow and exerting disruptive sexual selection between the original and incipient species. The incipient species do not differ in morphology or ecology from the original species, implying that colour polymorphism, associated with sex ratio distortion, can be an incipient stage in sympatric speciation, and that disruption of gene flow can precede ecological differentiation.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1461-0248.1999.00098.x,0
136,Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at <i>DTH2</i> with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia,"Flowering time (i.e., heading date in crops) is an important ecological trait that determines growing seasons and regional adaptability of plants to specific natural environments. Rice ( Oryza sativa L.) is a short-day plant that originated in the tropics. Increasing evidence suggests that the northward expansion of cultivated rice was accompanied by human selection of the heading date under noninductive long-day (LD) conditions. We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of DTH2 (for Days to heading on chromosome 2 ), a minor-effect quantitative trait locus that promotes heading under LD conditions. We show that DTH2 encodes a CONSTANS-like protein that promotes heading by inducing the florigen genes Heading date 3a and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 , and it acts independently of the known floral integrators Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1 . Moreover, association analysis and transgenic experiments identified two functional nucleotide polymorphisms in DTH2 that correlated with early heading and increased reproductive fitness under natural LD conditions in northern Asia. Our combined population genetics and network analyses suggest that DTH2 likely represents a target of human selection for adaptation to LD conditions during rice domestication and/or improvement, demonstrating an important role of minor-effect quantitative trait loci in crop adaptation and breeding.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1213962110,0
137,Monomorphism and polymorphism at Mhc DRB loci in domestic and wild ruminants,"Genetic polymorphism at Mhc class II DRB loci was investigated in samples of musk-ox from Canada and Greenland; moose from Sweden, Norway, Canada, and Alaska; roe deer from Norway and Sweden; reindeer from Svalbard and Norway; fallow deer from Norway and Sweden; and red deer from Norway. The results were compared with published data on cattle, bison, goat, sheep, and red deer. Cattle-specific primers amplified a single DRB locus in all species except fallow deer and red deer, in which two loci were found. Single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequence analysis were employed to detect genetic polymorphism. Complete monomorphism was found in musk-ox and fallow deer. Limited polymorphism was found in the moose, roe deer, and reindeer from Svalbard, whereas intermediate to extensive DRB diversity was present in reindeer from Norway and in bison, sheep, goat, cattle, and red deer. The restricted Mhc diversity in moose, roe deer, and fallow deer is notable in relation to the dramatic population expansion of moose and roe deer in Sweden during this century and since fallow deer is used for meat and game production with good results and without any marked disease problems. The results question the view that species or populations with restricted Mhc diversity have poor resistance to infectious diseases. A phylogenetic tree analysis revealed a clustering of DRB sequences within species rather than within allelic lineages across species. The results suggest trans-species persistence of polymorphic sequence motifs rather than of allelic lineages.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065x.1999.tb01390.x,0
138,Species and Geographic Differences in the Transferrin Polymorphism of Macaques,"Eleven molecular forms and 34 phenotypes of transferrin have been detected in 372 serums from six macaque species. The tendency to polymorphism varies from species to species and from one local population to another. The most extensive polymorphism was observed in Macaca mulatta, which showed at least ten transferrins and 24 phenotypes. Transferrins present in stump-tail macaques (M. speciosa) from Thailand were also found in crab-eating macaques (M. irus) from Thailand, but not in crab-eating macaques from the Philippines. The results suggest that macaque species are semispecies rather than complete species.",https://doi.org/10.1126/science.147.3660.884,0
139,Genetic polymorphisms: Impact on the risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders,"Clinical reports on monozygotic and dizygotic twins provided the initial evidence for the involvement of genetic factors in risk vulnerability for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Research with selectively bred and inbred rodents, genetic crosses of these lines and strains, and embryo culture studies have further clarified the role of both maternal and fetal genetics in the development of FASD. Research to identify specific polymorphisms contributing to FASD is still at an early stage. To date, polymorphisms of only one of the genes for the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme family, the ADH1B, have been demonstrated to contribute to FASD vulnerability. In comparison with ADH1B*1, both maternal and fetal ADH1B*2 have been shown to reduce risk for FAS in a mixed ancestry South African population. ADH1B*3 appears to afford protection for FASD outcomes in African-American populations. Other candidate genes should be examined with respect to FASD risk, including those for the enzymes of serotonin metabolism, in particular the serotonin transporter. By its very nature, alcohol teratogenesis is the expression of the interaction of genes with environment. The study of genetic factors in FASD falls within the new field of ecogenetics. Understanding of the array of genetic factors in FASD will be enhanced by future genetic investigations, including case-control, family association, and linkage studies.

140,Isozyme Polymorphism in Lens (Leguminosae),"Crossability and cytological studies have led to a recent taxonomic revision of Lens. Starch gel electrophoresis of isozymes was employed to clarify the relationships among the revised Lens taxa and provide further insight as to the origin of the cultivated lentil, L. culinaris ssp. culinaris. The 14 enzymes studied yielded scorable products of 25 putative isozyme loci, 16 of which were polymorphic. Isozyme polymorphism within accessions was extremely low while greater amounts of variation were observed among accessions and even greater amounts among taxa. A high degree of electrophoretic similarity was found among L. culinaris ssp. culinaris, L. culinaris ssp. orientalis, and L. culinaris ssp. odemensis. Lens nigricans ssp. ervoides possessed more allozymes in common with all three L. culinaris subspecies than with L. nigricans ssp. nigricans. Similarly, a differentiated cytotype of ssp. nigricans showed more electrophoretic affinity with all three L. culinaris subspecies and ssp. ervoides than with the remaining accessions of ssp. nigricans which emerged as the most electro- phoretically distinct group. On the basis of the electrophoretic data alone, ssp. orientalis and ssp. odemensis are the most likely progenitors of the cultivated lentil, ssp. culinaris.",https://doi.org/10.2307/2419075,0
141,Microsatellite polymorphism and the population structure of Atlantic cod (&lt;I&gt;Gadus morhua&lt;/I&gt;) in the northwest Atlantic,"Allelic variation in six highly polymorphic microsatellite loci (mean heterozygosity, 86%) provided evidence that cod (Gadus morhua) in the northwest Atlantic belong to multiple genetically distinguishable populations, and further that genetic differences may also exist between northwestern and southeastern cod aggregations within the northern cod stock complex off Newfoundland. Cod were sampled from winter aggregations ranging from Hamilton Bank to the northern Grand Bank in the northern cod complex, and from the Flemish Cap, the Scotian Shelf, and the Barents Sea. Tests of allele frequency homogeneity (χ 2 ), FST , and (δμ) 2 , allele sharing, and Rogersi distance measures revealed significant differences among northern cod, Flemish Cap, Scotian Shelf, and Barents Sea samples. Within the northern cod complex, two pooled samples, NORTH (Hamilton, Funk, and Belle Isle banks) and SOUTH (northern Grand Bank area), were distinguishable using χ 2 , (δμ) 2 , and allele sharing measures.

142,ECOLOGICAL GENETICS OF ADAPTIVE COLOR POLYMORPHISM IN POCKET MICE: GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION IN SELECTED AND NEUTRAL GENES,"Patterns of geographic variation in phenotype or genotype may provide evidence for natural selection. Here, we compare phenotypic variation in color, allele frequencies of a pigmentation gene (the melanocortin-1 receptor, Mc1r), and patterns of neutral mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation in rock pocket mice (Chaetodipus intermedius) across a habitat gradient in southern Arizona. Pocket mice inhabiting volcanic lava have dark coats with unbanded, uniformly melanic hairs, whereas mice from nearby light-colored granitic rocks have light coats with banded hairs. This color polymorphism is a presumed adaptation to avoid predation. Previous work has demonstrated that two Mc1r alleles, D and d, differ by four amino acids, and are responsible for the color polymorphism: DD and Dd genotypes are melanic whereas dd genotypes are light colored. To determine the frequency of the two Mc1r allelic classes across the dark-colored lava and neighboring light-colored granite, we sequenced the Mc1r gene in 175 individuals from a 35-km transect in the Pinacate lava region. We also sequenced two neutral mtDNA genes, COIII and ND3, in the same individuals. We found a strong correlation between Mc1r allele frequency and habitat color and no correlation between mtDNA markers and habitat color. Using estimates of migration from mtDNA haplotypes between dark- and light-colored sampling sites and Mc1r allele frequencies at each site, we estimated selection coefficients against mismatched Mc1r alleles, assuming a simple model of migration-selection balance. Habitat-dependent selection appears strong but asymmetric: selection is stronger against light mice on dark rock than against melanic mice on light rock. Together these results suggest that natural selection acts to match pocket mouse coat color to substrate color, despite high levels of gene flow between light and melanic populations.",https://doi.org/10.1554/03-418,0
143,Intraspecific competition drives multiple species resource polymorphism in fish communities,"It has been hypothesized that inter‐specific competition will reduce species niche utilization and drive morphological evolution in character displacement. In the absence of a competitor, intra‐specific competition may favor an expansion of the species niche and drive morphological evolution in character release. Despite of this theoretical framework, we sometimes find potential competitor species using the same niche range without any partitioning in niche. We used a database on test fishing in Sweden to evaluate the factors (inter‐ and intraspecific competition, predation, and abiotic factors) that could influence habitat choice of two competitor species. The pattern from the database shows that the occurrence of perch and roach occupying both littoral and pelagic habitats of lakes in Sweden is a general phenomenon. Furthermore, the results from the database suggest that this pattern is due to intra‐specific competition rather than inter‐specific competition or predation. In a field study, we estimated the morphological variation in perch and roach and found that, individuals of both species caught in the littoral zone were more deeper bodied compared to individuals caught in the pelagic zone. Pelagic perch fed more on zooplankton compared to littoral perch, independent of size, whereas the littoral perch had more macroinvertebrates and fish in their diet. Pelagic roach fed more on zooplankton compared to littoral roach, whereas littoral individuals fed more on plant material. Furthermore, we sampled littoral and pelagic fish from another lake to evaluate the generality of our first results and found the same habitat associated morphology in both perch and roach. The results show a consistent multi‐species morphological separation in the littoral and pelagic habitats. This study suggests that intra‐specific competition is possibly more important than inter‐specific competition for the morphological pattern in the perch‐roach system.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.16267.x,0
144,Typing of rhizobia by PCR DNA fingerprinting and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of chromosomal and symbiotic gene regions: application to Rhizobium leguminosarum and its different biovars,"Characterization of 43 strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovars viciae, trifolii, and phaseoli was performed by two methodologies based on PCR amplification, i.e., PCR DNA fingerprinting of interrepeat sequences and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of PCR -amplified chromosomal and symbiotic gene regions. Groupings generated by PCR DNA fingerprinting with either extragenic palindromic repetitive primers or two different single random primers were correlated with similar levels of resolution. Although less discriminating, PCR-RFLP analysis of intergenic spacer between genes coding for 16S and 23S rRNA (16S and 23S rDNA) yielded intraspecific polymorphisms. The classification of strains was independent of the biovar status and was in agreement with those obtained by PCR DNA fingerprinting. Intrabiovar variation within symbiotic gene regions was detected by PCR-RFLP analysis of nifDK and nodD gene regions, but the strains were grouped according to the biovar. The rDNA intergenic spacer and nif primers were verified to be universal for rhizobial species by testing of various reference strains, whereas the nod primers designed in this study were biovar or species specific for R. leguminosarum and Rhizobium etli. Classifications of R. leguminosarum strains by the PCR-based methods were correlated with those previously obtained by conventional total DNA restriction profile comparisons and RFLP analysis using chromosomal and symbiotic gene probes. Ranges of discriminating powers were also equivalent between the two approaches. However, the PCR-based methods are much less time-consuming and are therefore more convenient.",https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.62.6.2029-2036.1996,0
145,Novel Genetic Polymorphisms That Further Delineate the Phylogeny of the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> Complex,"In a previous report, we described a PCR protocol for the differentiation of the various species of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) on the basis of genomic deletions (R. C. Huard, L. C. de Oliveira Lazzarini, W. R. Butler, D. van Soolingen, and J. L. Ho, J. Clin. Microbiol. 41:1637-1650, 2003). That report also provided a broad cross-comparison of several previously identified, phylogenetically relevant, long-sequence and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (LSPs and SNPs, respectively). In the present companion report, we expand upon the previous work (i) by continuing the evaluation of known MTC phylogenetic markers in a larger collection of tubercle bacilli (n = 125), (ii) by evaluating additional recently reported MTC species-specific and interspecific polymorphisms, and (iii) by describing the identification and distribution of a number of novel LSPs and SNPs. Notably, new genomic deletions were found in various Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, new species-specific SNPs were identified for ""Mycobacterium canettii,"" Mycobacterium microti, and Mycobacterium pinnipedii, and, for the first time, intraspecific single-nucleotide DNA differences were discovered for the dassie bacillus, the oryx bacillus, and the two Mycobacterium africanum subtype I variants. Surprisingly, coincident polymorphisms linked one M. africanum subtype I genotype with the dassie bacillus and M. microti with M. pinnipedii, thereby suggesting closer evolutionary ties within each pair of species than had been previously thought. Overall, the presented data add to the genetic definitions of several MTC organisms as well as fine-tune current models for the evolutionary history of the MTC.",https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.01783-05,0
146,Natural Selection for Polymorphism in the Disease Resistance Gene <i>Rps2</i> of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>,"Abstract Pathogen resistance is an ecologically important phenotype increasingly well understood at the molecular genetic level. In this article, we examine levels of avrRpt2-dependent resistance and Rps2 locus DNA sequence variability in a worldwide sample of 27 accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana. The rooted parsimony tree of Rps2 sequences drawn from a diverse set of ecotypes includes a deep bifurcation separating major resistance and susceptibility clades of alleles. We find evidence for selection maintaining these alleles and identify the N-terminal part of the leucine-rich repeat region as a probable target of selection. Additional protein variants are found within the two major clades and correlate well with measurable differences among ecotypes in resistance to the avirulence gene avrRpt2 of the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Long-lived polymorphisms have been observed for other resistance genes of A. thaliana; the Rps2 data suggest that the long-term maintenance of phenotypic variation in resistance genes may be a general phenomenon and are consistent with diversifying selection acting in concert with selection to maintain variation.",https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/163.2.735,0
147,A microsatellite polymorphism in the gamma interferon gene is associated with resistance to gastrointestinal nematodes in a naturally-parasitized population of Soay sheep,"Free-living Soay sheep ( Ovis aries ) on the island of Hirta, St Kilda, Scotland, are naturally parasitized by gastrointestinal nematodes, predominantly Teladorsagia circumcincta . In this paper we show that reduced faecal egg counts (FEC) are associated with an allele at a microsatellite locus located in the first intron of the interferon gamma gene (o(IFN)-γ) in Soay sheep lambs and yearlings, measured at approximately 4 and 16 months of age, respectively. The same allele was also associated with increased T. circumcincta -specific antibody (IgA) in lambs, but not associated significantly in yearlings. Flanking control markers failed to show a significant association with either FEC or IgA. These results suggest that a polymorphic gene conferring increased resistance to gastrointestinal nematode parasites is located at or near the interferon gamma gene, and support previous reports which have mapped a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for resistance to this region in domestic sheep. Our data are consistent with the idea that a functional polymorphism leading to reduced expression or efficacy of (IFN)-γ could enhance the immune response to gastrointestinal nematodes by favouring the activity of the Th 2 cell subset and antibody associated immune mechanisms.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0031182001007570,0
148,"Association of Liver Injury From Specific Drugs, or Groups of Drugs, With Polymorphisms in HLA and Other Genes in a Genome-Wide Association Study","Background & AimsWe performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic risk factors for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) from licensed drugs without previously reported genetic risk factors.MethodsWe performed a GWAS of 862 persons with DILI and 10,588 population-matched controls. The first set of cases was recruited before May 2009 in Europe (n = 137) and the United States (n = 274). The second set of cases were identified from May 2009 through May 2013 from international collaborative studies performed in Europe, the United States, and South America. For the GWAS, we included only cases with patients of European ancestry associated with a particular drug (but not flucloxacillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate). We used DNA samples from all subjects to analyze HLA genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms. After the discovery analysis was concluded, we validated our findings using data from 283 European patients with diagnosis of DILI associated with various drugs.ResultsWe associated DILI with rs114577328 (a proxy for A*33:01 a HLA class I allele; odds ratio [OR], 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9−3.8; P = 2.4 × 10−8) and with rs72631567 on chromosome 2 (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.6−2.5; P = 9.7 × 10−9). The association with A*33:01 was mediated by large effects for terbinafine-, fenofibrate-, and ticlopidine-related DILI. The variant on chromosome 2 was associated with DILI from a variety of drugs. Further phenotypic analysis indicated that the association between DILI and A*33:01 was significant genome wide for cholestatic and mixed DILI, but not for hepatocellular DILI; the polymorphism on chromosome 2 was associated with cholestatic and mixed DILI as well as hepatocellular DILI. We identified an association between rs28521457 (within the lipopolysaccharide-responsive vesicle trafficking, beach and anchor containing gene) and only hepatocellular DILI (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6−2.7; P = 4.8 × 10−9). We did not associate any specific drug classes with genetic polymorphisms, except for statin-associated DILI, which was associated with rs116561224 on chromosome 18 (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 3.0−9.5; P = 7.1 × 10−9). We validated the association between A*33:01 terbinafine- and sertraline-induced DILI. We could not validate the association between DILI and rs72631567, rs28521457, or rs116561224.ConclusionsIn a GWAS of persons of European descent with DILI, we associated HLA-A*33:01 with DILI due to terbinafine and possibly fenofibrate and ticlopidine. We identified polymorphisms that appear to be associated with DILI from statins, as well as 2 non−drug-specific risk factors. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic risk factors for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) from licensed drugs without previously reported genetic risk factors.

149,The Two Faces of ACE2: The Role of ACE2 Receptor and Its Polymorphisms in Hypertension and COVID-19,"The mechanism for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection requires the binding of the virus to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, well-known for its role in counteracting ACE. ACE2 is involved in modulating blood pressure and establishing blood pressure homeostasis. Recently, a critical debatable question has arisen whether using antihypertensive medications will have a favorable impact on people infected with SARS-CoV-2 or a deleterious one, mainly because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) therapy can modulate the expression of ACE2 protein. The concern is that the use of ACEIs and ARBs will increase the expression of ACE2 and increase patient susceptibility to viral host cell entry and propagation. On the other hand, several genetic association studies have examined the relationship between ACE2 genetic variants and the risk of developing hypertension in different ethnic populations. In this review, we discuss the ongoing arguments in the literature about ACE2's role in mortality rate among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients comorbid with hypertension and critically evaluate the current debate about the usage or discontinuation of ACEI/ARB antihypertensive drugs. Moreover, we explore the two opposing roles that ACE2 genetic variants might be playing in COVID-19 by reducing ACE2 receptor effectiveness and mitigating SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.

Moreover, we explore the two opposing roles that ACE2 genetic variants might be playing in COVID-19 by reducing ACE2 receptor effectiveness and mitigating SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic of acute respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The mortality rates, as well as the infectious capacity of the virus, ranging from 1% to >5%, have raised a major concern worldwide. Older people with comorbid conditions, such as pulmonary disease, cardiac disease, kidney disease, diabetes, and hypertension, are associated with higher mortality rates.1Guan W.J. Liang W.H. Zhao Y.

The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection necessitates the binding of the virus to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and internalization of the complex by the host cell (Figure 1). Apart from its role as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (and for both the SARS-CoV and the related human respiratory coronavirus NL63), ACE2 is well-known for its role in hypertension. ACE2 modulates blood pressure and maintains blood pressure homeostasis through negatively regulating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).4Li J. Wang X. Chen J. Zhang H. Deng A.

Allergy Drug Targets. 2014; 13: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar ACE2 exerts its functions through cleaving either angiotensin I (Ang I) or Ang II into the inactive peptides Ang (1–9) and Ang (1–7), respectively (Figure 1). Ang (1–9) gets further metabolized into Ang (1–7). Ang (1–7) is a vasodilator, hence ACE2 counteracts the vasoconstrictor effects of the ACE-Ang II axis. The mechanism by which ACE2 antagonizes the effects of Ang II is either by cleaving the precursor Ang I, which reduces Ang II synthesis in tissues, or by directly hydrolyzing Ang II and reducing its levels in plasma. Both ACE and ACE2 are endothelium-bound carboxypeptidases that can be cleaved by different metalloproteases located on the cell surface and released in a soluble form. Contrary to ACE, which is widely expressed in many tissues and organs, ACE2's high expression is confined to the endothelial cells of the arteries, arterioles, and venules of the heart and kidney.4Li J.

The concern is that the use of ACEIs and ARBs will increase the expression of ACE2 and increase patient susceptibility to viral host cell entry and propagation. As a result, there has been a call for the discontinuation of ACEI/ARB usage prophylactically and in the context of suspected COVID-19 cases. In this review, we shed light on the current debate about ACE2's role in the mortality associated with COVID-19 cases with hypertension and weigh on the current argument about the usage or discontinuation of ACEI/ARB hypertensive medication. Finally, we explore the role of ACE2 genetic variants in the predisposition for hypertension and the response to hypertension treatments. Several epidemiological studies have established the augmented mortality in COVID-19 patients with hypertension. For instance, Wu et al.2Wu C. Chen X. Cai Y. Xia J. Zhou X. Xu S. Huang H. Zhang L.

However, a critical question that remains unanswered is whether this association is solely attributed to the pathogenesis of hypertension or to the associated comorbidity or therapy. In this section, we review recent findings regarding the role of antihypertensive medications, which have been at the center of a considerable debate, namely, ACEIs and ARBs. The main question has been whether they have a favorable impact on the people infected with SARS-CoV-2 or a deleterious one mainly because ACEI and ARB therapies can modulate the expression of ACE2, which has been identified as a receptor for SARS-COV2. The concern is that the use of ACEIs and ARBs will increase the expression of ACE2 and increase patient susceptibility to viral host cell entry and propagation. As a result, there has been a call for the discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs usage prophylactically and in the context of suspected COVID-19. However, other groups have been suggesting the opposite, where increased ACE2 can act as a vasodilator, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory. This is because ACE2 primarily acts to counterpoise the effect of ACE. Because ACE produces Ang II from Ang I, ACE2 generates Ang (1–9) from Ang I or Ang (1–7) from Ang II, respectively. Ang (1–7) possesses vasodilator, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties that, upon binding to the Mas receptor broadly, shifts the balance from vasoconstriction with Ang II to vasodilation with Mas receptor activation in the affected vascular bed.20Santos R.A.

ACE2 and Ang (1–7) are protective in several different lung injury models.

150,Modeling Gynodioecy: Novel Scenarios for Maintaining Polymorphism,"Nuclear‐cytoplasmic gynodioecy is a breeding system of plants in which females and hermaphrodites co‐occur in populations, and gender is jointly determined by cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) genes and nuclear restorers of male fertility. Persistent polymorphism at both CMS and nuclear‐restorer loci is necessary to maintain this breeding system. Theoretical models have explained how nuclear‐cytoplasmic gynodioecy can be stable for certain assumptions. However, recent advances in our understanding of the genetics, population biology, and molecular mechanisms of sex determination in nuclear‐cytoplasmic gynodioecious species suggest the utility of new models with different underlying assumptions. In this article, we examine different negative pleiotropic fitness effects of nuclear restorers (costs of restoration) using genetic and population assumptions based on recent literature. Specifically, we model populations with two CMS types and separate nuclear restorer loci for each CMS type. Under these assumptions, both overdominance for fitness and frequency‐dependent selection at nuclear‐restorer loci can support nuclear‐cytoplasmic gynodioecy. Costs of restoration can be either dependent or independent of the cytoplasmic background. Seed fitness costs are more vulnerable to fixation of CMS types than pollen costs. Survivorship costs are effective at maintaining polymorphism even when total reproductive effects are low. Overall, our models display differences in the stability of nuclear‐cytoplasmic gynodioecy and predicted population sex ratios that should be informative to researchers studying gynodioecy in the wild.",https://doi.org/10.1086/374803,0
151,DNA Polymorphism at the FRIGIDA Gene in Arabidopsis thaliana: Extensive Nonsynonymous Variation Is Consistent with Local Selection for Flowering Time,"FRIGIDA (FRI) is a major gene involved in the regulation of flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana. Nucleotide variation at this gene was investigated by sequencing 25 field ecotypes collected from western Europe. Genetic diversity at FRI was characterized by a high number of haplotypes and an excess of low-frequency polymorphisms. A large excess of intraspecific nonsynonymous variation associated with low synonymous variation was detected along the first exon in the FRI gene. In contrast, no excess of nonsynonymous divergence was detected between A. thaliana and A. lyrata. The Tajima and McDonald and Kreitman tests, however, suggested that this gene has evolved in a nonneutral fashion. Nonsynonymous variation included eight loss-of-function mutations that have probably arisen recently and independently in several locations. A phenotypic evaluation of the sequenced ecotypes confirmed that these loss-of-function mutations were associated with an early-flowering phenotype. Taken together, our results suggest that DNA polymorphism at the FRI gene in A. thaliana from western Europe has been shaped by recent positive selection for earliness in a set of isolated populations.",https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a004187,0
152,"Molecular analysis of jejunal, ileal, caecal and recto-sigmoidal human colonic microbiota using 16S rRNA gene libraries and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism","Microbiota in gut contents of jejunum, ileum, caecum and recto-sigmoid colon obtained from three elderly individuals at autopsy were compared using 16S rRNA gene libraries and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). Random clones of 16S rRNA gene sequences were isolated after PCR amplification with universal primer sets of total genomic DNA extracted from each sample of gut contents. An average of 90 randomly selected clones were partially sequenced (about 500 bp). T-RFLP analysis was performed using the 16S rRNA gene amplified from each sample. The lengths of the terminal restriction fragments were analysed after digestion with Hha I and Msp I. The jejunal and ileal microbiota consisted of simple microbial communities of streptococci, lactobacilli, ‘ Gammaproteobacteria ', the Enterococcus group and the Bacteroides group. Most of the species were facultative anaerobes or aerobes. The Clostridium coccoides group and the Clostridium leptum subgroup, which are the most predominant groups in human faeces, were not detected in samples from the upper gastrointestinal tract. The caecal microbiota was more complex than the jejunal and ileal microbiota. The C . coccoides group, the C . leptum subgroup and the Bacteroides group were detected in the caecum. The recto-sigmoidal colonic microbiota consisted of complex microbial communities, with numerous species that belonged to the C. coccoides group, the C. leptum subgroup, the Bacteroides group, ‘ Gammaproteobacteria ', the Bifidobacterium group, streptococci and lactobacilli, and included more than 26 operational taxonomic units. The results showed marked individual differences in the composition of microbiota in each region.",https://doi.org/10.1099/jmm.0.45935-0,0
153,Is colour polymorphism advantageous to populations and species?,"I am writing in response to an article by Bolton, Rollins and Griffith (2015) entitled ‘The danger within: the role of genetic, behavioural and ecological factors in population persistence of colour polymorphic species’ that was recently published as an Opinion under the NEWS AND VIEWS section in Molecular Ecology. Bolton et al . ( Molecular Ecology , 2015, 24 , 2907) argue that colour polymorphism may reduce population fitness and increase extinction risk and emphasize that this is contrary to predictions put forward by Forsman et al . ( Ecology , 89 , 2008, 34) and Wennersten &amp; Forsman ( Biological Reviews 87 , 2012, 756) that the existence of multiple colour morphs with co‐adapted gene complexes and associated trait values may increase the ecological and evolutionary success of polymorphic populations and species. Bolton et al . ( Molecular Ecology , 2015, 24 , 2907) further state that there is no clear evidence from studies of ‘true polymorphic species’ that polymorphism promotes population persistence. In response, I (i) challenge their classifications of polymorphisms and revisit the traditional definitions recognizing the dynamic nature of polymorphisms, (ii) review empirical studies that have examined whether and how polymorphism is associated with extinction risk, (iii) discuss the roles of trait correlations between colour pattern and other phenotypic dimensions for population fitness and (iv) highlight that the causes and mechanisms that influence the composition and maintenance of polymorphisms are different from the consequences of the polymorphic condition and how it may impact on aspects of ecological success and long‐term persistence of populations and species.",https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.13629,0
154,The genetic basis of a social polymorphism in halictid bees,"The emergence of eusociality represents a major evolutionary transition from solitary to group reproduction. The most commonly studied eusocial species, honey bees and ants, represent the behavioral extremes of social evolution but lack close relatives that are non-social. Unlike these species, the halictid bee Lasioglossum albipes produces both solitary and eusocial nests and this intraspecific variation has a genetic basis. Here, we identify genetic variants associated with this polymorphism, including one located in the intron of syntaxin 1a (syx1a), a gene that mediates synaptic vesicle release. We show that this variant can alter gene expression in a pattern consistent with differences between social and solitary bees. Surprisingly, syx1a and several other genes associated with sociality in L. albipes have also been implicated in autism spectrum disorder in humans. Thus, genes underlying behavioral variation in L. albipes may also shape social behaviors across a wide range of taxa, including humans.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-06824-8,0
155,Restriction site polymorphism of the genes encoding the major 25 kDa and 36 kDa outer-membrane proteins of Brucella,"Seventy-seven Brucella reference and field strains from different geographic origins and hosts representing the six recognized species and their different biovars were analysed for diversity of their genes encoding the major 25 and 36 kDa outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) by PCR-RFLP. The 25 kDa OMP is encoded by a single gene (omp25) whereas two closely related genes (omp2a and omp2b) encode and potentially express the 36 kDa OMP. Analysis of PCR products of the omp25 gene digested with nine restriction enzymes revealed two species-specific markers, i.e. the absence of the EcoRV site in all Brucella melitensis strains and an ~ 50 bp deletion at the 3' terminal end of the gene in all Brucella ovis strains. Analysis of PCR products of the omp2a and omp2b genes digested with 13 restriction enzymes indicated a greater diversity than the omp25 gene among the six Brucella species and within the Brucella abortus, Brucella suis, B. melitensis and B. ovis species. Greater polymorphism was also detected for the omp2b than for the omp2a gene, especially in B. ovis which seemed to carry two similar (but not identical) copies of omp2a instead of one copy each of omp2a and omp2b for the other Brucella species as was previously suggested by Ficht et al. (1990; Mol Microbiol 4, 1135-1142). Results of PCR-RFLP indicated that distinction can be made between Brucella species and some of their biovars, except between B. canis and B. suis bv. 3 and 4, on the basis of the size and diversity of their major OMP genes, and that it could be of importance for diagnostic, epidemiological and evolutionary study purposes.",https://doi.org/10.1099/13500872-141-9-2111,0
156,"Effects of Temperature on Growth, Development, and Color Polymorphism in the Ornate Chorus Frog Pseudacris ornata","We studied the effects of five temperature treatments (10 C, 15 C, 20 C, 25 C, 30 C) on larval development, growth, and color polymorphism of Pseudacris ornata in the laboratory. Body mass and developmental stage on day 32 increased with increasing temperature to 25 C, then decreased at 30 C. Mass at metamorphosis and time to metamorphosis decreased with increasing temperature treatments. Fewer deformities and greater average survival were found at intermediate temperature treatments of 20 C and 25 C than at the two extremes of 10 C and 30 C. No larvae metamorphosed from the 10 C treatment after 111 d and individuals only reached Gosner stage 30. Copper, brown, and gray metamorphs were produced from brown and gray parents; green morphs were not present. The proportion of brown metamorphs increased with increasing temperatures, but there was no change in gray metamorphs with temperature. The copper color morph was not observed at metamorphosis, but was distinguishable several weeks after metamorphosis. Alteration of temperature in the larval environment may explain some of the temporal and spatial variation in: 1) time to metamorphosis; 2) size at metamorphosis; and 3) relative frequency of color morphs in natural populations of P. ornata and amphibians, in general.",https://doi.org/10.2307/1445724,0
157,Expressed Sequence Tag-Linked Microsatellites as a Source of Gene-Associated Polymorphisms for Detecting Signatures of Divergent Selection in Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar L.),"The prediction that selection affects the genome in a locus-specific way also affecting flanking neutral variation, known as genetic hitchhiking, enables the use of polymorphic markers in noncoding regions to detect the footprints of selection. However, as the strength of the selective footprint on a locus depends on the distance from the selected site and will decay with time due to recombination, the utilization of polymorphic markers closely linked to coding regions of the genome should increase the probability of detecting the footprints of selection as more gene-containing regions are covered. The occurrence of highly polymorphic microsatellites in the untranslated regions of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) is a potentially useful source of gene-associated polymorphisms which has thus far not been utilized for genome screens in natural populations. In this study, we searched for the genetic signatures of divergent selection by screening 95 genomic and EST-derived mini- and microsatellites in eight natural Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., populations from different spatial scales inhabiting contrasting natural environments (salt-, brackish, and freshwater habitat). Altogether, we identified nine EST-associated microsatellites, which exhibited highly significant deviations from the neutral expectations using different statistical methods at various spatial scales and showed similar trends in separate population samples from different environments (salt-, brackish, and freshwater habitats) and sea areas (Barents vs. White Sea). We consider these ESTs as the best candidate loci affected by divergent selection, and hence, they serve as promising genes associated with adaptive divergence in Atlantic salmon. Our results demonstrate that EST-linked microsatellite genome scans provide an efficient strategy for discovering functional polymorphisms, especially in nonmodel organisms.",https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msi093,0
158,Epistasis and Allele Specificity in the Emergence of a Stable Polymorphism in <i>Escherichia coli</i>,"Ecological opportunities promote population divergence into coexisting lineages. However, the genetic mechanisms that enable new lineages to exploit these opportunities are poorly understood except in cases of single mutations. We examined how two Escherichia coli lineages diverged from their common ancestor at the outset of a long-term coexistence. By sequencing genomes and reconstructing the genetic history of one lineage, we showed that three mutations together were sufficient to produce the frequency-dependent fitness effects that allowed this lineage to invade and stably coexist with the other. These mutations all affected regulatory genes and collectively caused substantial metabolic changes. Moreover, the particular derived alleles were critical for the initial divergence and invasion, indicating that the establishment of this polymorphism depended on specific epistatic interactions.",https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1248688,0

Ischnura elegans has three colour morphs: one male-like coloured (androchrome) and two additional gynochrome brown morphs (infuscans and rufescens-obsoleta morphs). A total of 19 progenies obtained from once-mated females were reared in the laboratory in three generations. Results indicate that the colour morphs are controlled by the same genetic system as previously described for I. graellsii, i.e. an autosomal locus with female-limited expression and with three alleles with a hierarchy of dominance (pa > pi > p°). Five interspecific crossings between female I. graellsii and male I. elegans, five crossings between hybrid females and male I. elegans and one crossing between female I. graellsii and a hybrid male further confirmed that the genetic system is the same in both species. A survey of morph frequencies in north-west Spain revealed that I. elegans shows high variability in androchrome frequency (4–91%) between nearby populations, whereas in I. graellsii androchromes never are the majority morph (5–40%). The highest androchrome frequency in I. graellsii was found in populations closest to a locality where both species have hybridized, and that now has the highest androchrome frequency of I. elegans. We hypothesize that I. elegans genes have been incorporated into the genome of I. graellsii resulting in increased androchrome frequency in the latter species. Low androchrome frequency in I. elegans seems also related to the influence of I. graellsii genes. Therefore, we suggest that hybridization between both taxa is contributing to the temporal maintenance of contrasting androchrome frequencies in nearby populations.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2005.00506.x,0
160,Polymorphism at a mimicry supergene maintained by opposing frequency-dependent selection pressures,"Explaining the maintenance of adaptive diversity within populations is a long-standing goal in evolutionary biology, with important implications for conservation, medicine, and agriculture. Adaptation often leads to the fixation of beneficial alleles, and therefore it erodes local diversity so that understanding the coexistence of multiple adaptive phenotypes requires deciphering the ecological mechanisms that determine their respective benefits. Here, we show how antagonistic frequency-dependent selection (FDS), generated by natural and sexual selection acting on the same trait, maintains mimicry polymorphism in the toxic butterfly Heliconius numata Positive FDS imposed by predators on mimetic signals favors the fixation of the most abundant and best-protected wing-pattern morph, thereby limiting polymorphism. However, by using mate-choice experiments, we reveal disassortative mate preferences of the different wing-pattern morphs. The resulting negative FDS on wing-pattern alleles is consistent with the excess of heterozygote genotypes at the supergene locus controlling wing-pattern variation in natural populations of H. numata The combined effect of positive and negative FDS on visual signals is sufficient to maintain a diversity of morphs displaying accurate mimicry with other local prey, although some of the forms only provide moderate protection against predators. Our findings help understand how alternative adaptive phenotypes can be maintained within populations and emphasize the need to investigate interactions between selective pressures in other cases of puzzling adaptive polymorphism.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1702482114,0
161,Temporal and Spatial Heterogeneity of mtDNA Polymorphisms in Natural Populations of <i>Drosophila mercatorum</i>,"ABSTRACT Restriction endonuclease analysis of mtDNA was used to examine the genetic relatedness of several geographically separated isolines of the Drosophila mercatorum subgroup. In addition, we examined the temporal and spatial distribution of two mtDNA restriction site polymorphisms produced by the enzymes BstEII and BstNI at a single locality—Kamuela, Hawaii. Due to small sample sizes of some collections and the undesirable dependance of the estimation of polymorphism frequency on its variance, an arcsin square root transformation of the frequency data was used. We also use an Fst estimator of our transformed frequencies to demonstrate considerable spatial and temporal differentiation within the Kamuela population. In contrast, isozyme data from the same population reveals no pattern of differentiation. The temporal and geographic heterogeneity and population subdivision detected with mtDNA analysis also is consistent with the known dispersal behavior and ecological constraints of this species. The mtDNA data in conjunction with the isozyme data show that the population structure of the Kamuela D. mercatorum is close to the boundary line separating panmixia from subdivision, a conclusion that could not be made from isozyme data alone.",https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/116.2.215,0
162,Wide nucleo-cytoplasmic polymorphism for male sterility in Origanum vulgare L.,"Natural populations of O. vulgare contain 1–62 percent male-sterile (mS) plants. The inheritance of male sterility in P1, V2, and V3 families involved a distinct cytoplasmic factor interacting with specific restorer genes (Rf1, Rf2, and Rf3) in each case. The inheritance patterns of 21 additional mS plants, collected from diverse populations, are reported here. Each mS plant was crossed with four male testers (all heterozygous for Rf1, two for Rf2, and two for Rf3). Nine mS plants gave segregation patterns like P1, none like V2, and two like V3 cytoplasms. The remaining mS plants were characterized by at least three segregation patterns in sharp contrast with those of P1, V2, and V3 cytoplasms. Four mS plants (V4, V5, V6, and Y7) gave only male-fertile (mF) progenies with the male testers, within-family studies demonstrated monogenic inheritance in each family. However, reciprocal between-family crosses showed that the genes acting in each family represent distinct loci (designated respectively Rf4 to Rf7)- Distinct asymmetric results were obtained in some reciprocal crosses (e.g., in Y7 vs. other families; V5 vs. V6, P1 vs. other families, and in V5 vs. V6) suggesting cytoplasmic differences between such families. In studies of seven families (P1, V2 to V6 and Y7] where reciprocal between-family crosses were accomplished, results indicated different restorer genes and probably distinct cytoplasmic interactions in every case. Five of these families came from the same population (V2 to V6). Other mS plants of this population gave different results as did the mS plants tested from other populations. The same natural population seems therefore to contain a large number of nucleo-cytoplasmic factors for male sterility. The biological significance of such large cytoplasmic polymorphism in natural populations and its potential application in plant genetics and plant breeding are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a109424,0
163,Intraspecies Polymorphism of <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> Revealed by PCR-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) and RFLP-Single-Strand Conformational Polymorphism Analyses,"ABSTRACT A glycoprotein (Cpgp40/15)-encoding gene of Cryptosporidium parvum was analyzed to reveal intraspecies polymorphism within C . parvum isolates. Forty-one isolates were collected from different geographical origins (Japan, Italy, and Nepal) and hosts (humans, calves, and a goat). These isolates were characterized by means of DNA sequencing, PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), and RFLP-single-strand conformational polymorphism (RFLP-SSCP) analyses of the gene for Cpgp40/15. The sequence analysis indicated that there was DNA polymorphism between genotype I and II, as well as within genotype I, isolates. The DNA and amino acid sequence identities between genotypes I and II differed, depending on the isolates, ranging from 73.3 to 82.9% and 62.4 to 80.1%, respectively. Those among genotype I isolates differed, depending on the isolates, ranging from 69.0 to 85.4% and 54.8 to 79.2%, respectively. Because of the high resolution generated by PCR-RFLP and RFLP-SSCP, the isolates of genotype I could be subtyped as genotypes Ia1, Ia2, Ib, and Ie. The isolates of genotype II could be subtyped as genotypes IIa, IIb, and IIc. The isolates from calves, a goat, and one Japanese human were identified as genotype II. Within genotype II, the isolates from Japan were identified as genotype IIa, those from calves in Italy were identified as genotype IIb, and the goat isolate was identified as genotype IIc. All of the genotype I isolates were from humans. The Japanese isolate (code no. HJ3) and all of the Nepalese isolates were identified as genotypes Ia1 and Ia2, respectively. The Italian isolates were identified as genotype Ib, and the Japanese isolate (code no. HJ2) was identified as genotype Ie. Thus, the PCR-RFLP-SSCP analysis of this glycoprotein Cpgp40/15 gene generated a high resolution that has not been achieved by previous methods of genotypic differentiation of C . parvum .",https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.69.8.4720-4726.2003,0

165,"Factors responsible for a karyotypic polymorphism in the common shrew, <i>Sorex araneus</i>","A Robertsonian karyotypic polymorphism in the common shrew in the Oxford area, first described in the 1950s, was re-examined. The polymorphism involves chromosome arm combinations kq, no and pr (characteristic of the Oxford karyotypic race), ko (characteristic of the Hermitage karyotypic race) and jl (found in both races). The polymorphism for jl was sporadic along a north-south transect through the Oxford area, with the frequency of the twin-acrocentric morph never exceeding 10%. The frequency of the Oxford race-specific metacentrics decreased and the frequency of the Hermitage race-specific metacentric ko increased from north to south along the transect. At a latitudinal grid reference of about 180 km, there was a high frequency of individuals with chromosome arms k, n, o and q in the ancestral acrocentric state. This was coincident with the area of occurrence of ko-kq and ko-no Oxford-Hermitage hybrids. Such hybrids are double Robertsonian heterozygotes with monobrachial homology and are likely to suffer reduced fertility in consequence. It is proposed that this is a source of selection against the monobrachial hybrids and hence results in an increase in frequency of the acrocentric morphs. This scheme goes some way to explain the clines of polymorphism for arm combinations kq, no and ko, but it is suggested that other selective factors are involved. It cannot explain the cline of polymorphism for pr, which is in general terms similar to that for kq and no, but is more shallow and centred further north.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1986.0086,0
166,Variable Virulence and Efficacy of BCG Vaccine Strains in Mice and Correlation With Genome Polymorphisms,"Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG), an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, is the only vaccine available for tuberculosis (TB) control. However, BCG is not an ideal vaccine and has two major limitations: BCG exhibits highly variable effectiveness against the development of TB both in pediatric and adult populations and can cause disseminated BCG disease in immunocompromised individuals. BCG comprises a number of substrains that are genetically distinct. Whether and how these genetic differences affect BCG efficacy remains largely unknown. In this study, we performed comparative analyses of the virulence and efficacy of 13 BCG strains, representing different genetic lineages, in SCID and BALB/c mice. Our results show that BCG strains of the DU2 group IV (BCG-Phipps, BCG-Frappier, BCG-Pasteur, and BCG-Tice) exhibit the highest levels of virulence, and BCG strains of the DU2 group II (BCG-Sweden, BCG-Birkhaug) are among the least virulent group. These distinct levels of virulence may be explained by strain-specific duplications and deletions of genomic DNA. There appears to be a general trend that more virulent BCG strains are also more effective in protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis challenge. Our findings have important implications for current BCG vaccine programs and for future TB vaccine development.

167,Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) reveal details of polyploid evolution in <i>Dactylorhiza</i> (Orchidaceae),"The utility of the PCR-based AFLP technique (polymerase chain reaction; amplified fragment length polymorphisms) was explored in elucidating details of polyploid evolution in the Eurasian orchid genus Dactylorhiza. We emphasized Swedish taxa but also included some material from the British Isles and elsewhere in Europe. Three different sets of primers, amplifying different subsets of restriction fragments, independently revealed similar patterns for relationships among the Dactylorhiza samples investigated. The AFLP data support the general picture of polyploid evolution in Dactylorhiza, i.e., that allotetraploid derivatives have arisen repeatedly as a result of hybridization beween the two parental groups D. incarnata s.l. (sensu lato; diploid marsh orchids) and the D. maculata group (spotted orchids). Within the incarnata s.l. group, morphologically defined varieties were interdigitated. The D. maculata group consisted of two distinct subgroups, one containing autotetraploid D. maculata subsp. maculata and the other containing diploid D. maculata subsp. fuchsii. Allotetraploids showed a high degree of additivity for the putative parental genomes, and relationships among them were partly correlated to morphologically based entities, but also to geographic distribution. Thus, allotetraploid taxa from the British Isles clustered together, rather than with morphologically similar plants from other areas.",https://doi.org/10.2307/3558363,0
168,Association between DRD4 gene polymorphism and personality variation in great tits: a test across four wild populations,"Polymorphisms in the dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4) have been related to individual variation in novelty-seeking or exploratory behaviour in a variety of animals, including humans. Recently, the human DRD4 orthologue was sequenced in a wild bird, the great tit (Parus major) and a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 3 of this gene (SNP830) was shown to be associated with variation in exploratory behaviour of lab-raised individuals originating from a single wild population. Here we test the generality of this finding in a large sample of free-living individuals from four European great tit populations, including the originally sampled population. We demonstrate that the association between SNP830 genotype and exploratory behaviour also exists in free-living birds from the original population. However, in the other three populations we found only limited evidence for an association: in two populations the association appeared absent; while in one there was a nonsignificant tendency. We could not confirm a previously demonstrated interaction with another DRD4 polymorphism, a 15 bp indel in the promoter region (ID15). As yet unknown differences in genetic or environmental background could explain why the same genetic polymorphism (SNP830) has a substantial effect on exploratory behaviour in one population, explaining 4.5-5.8% of the total variance-a large effect for a single gene influencing a complex behavioural trait-but not in three others. The confirmation of an association between SNP830 genotype and personality-related behaviour in a wild bird population warrants further research into potential fitness effects of the polymorphism, while also the population differences in the strength of the association deserve further investigation. Another important future challenge is the identification of additional loci influencing avian personality traits in the wild.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294x.2009.04518.x,0
169,"Evidence for Inversion Polymorphism Related to Sympatric Host Race Formation in the Apple Maggot Fly, <i>Rhagoletis pomonella</i>","Evidence suggests that the apple maggot, Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae) is undergoing sympatric speciation (i.e., divergence without geographic isolation) in the process of shifting and adapting to a new host plant. Prior to the introduction of cultivated apples (Malus pumila) in North America, R. pomonella infested the fruit of native hawthorns (Crataegus spp.). However, sometime in the mid-1800s the fly formed a sympatric race on apple. The recently derived apple-infesting race shows consistent allele frequency differences from the hawthorn host race for six allozyme loci mapping to three different chromosomes. Alleles at all six of these allozymes correlate with the timing of adult eclosion, an event dependent on the duration of the overwintering pupal diapause. This timing difference differentially adapts the univoltine fly races to an approximately 3- to 4-week difference in the peak fruiting times of apple and hawthorn trees, partially reproductively isolating the host races. Here, we report finding substantial gametic disequilibrium among allozyme and complementary DNA (cDNA) markers encompassing the three chromosomal regions differentiating apple and hawthorn flies. The regions of disequilibrium extend well beyond the previously characterized six allozyme loci, covering substantial portions of chromosomes 1, 2, and 3 (haploid n = 6 in R. pomonella). Moreover, significant recombination heterogeneity and variation in gene order were observed among single-pair crosses for each of the three genomic regions, implying the existence of inversion polymorphism. We therefore have evidence that genes affecting diapause traits involved in host race formation reside within large complexes of rearranged genes. We explore whether these genomic regions (inversions) constitute coadapted gene complexes and discuss the implications of our findings for sympatric speciation in Rhagoletis.",https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/163.3.939,0
170,Diversity of the archaeal community in 44 anaerobic digesters as determined by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and 16S rDNA sequencing,"Summary The diversity of Archaea in anaerobic digesters was characterized by strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and the sequencing of 16S rDNA genes. The 44 digesters sampled, located in eight different countries, treated effluents from agriculture, the food processing and petro‐chemical industries, pulp and paper plant, breweries, slaughterhouses and municipal waste. All the existing processes were represented among the samples (fixed‐film, fluidized bed, stirred‐tank, UASB, sequential batch reactor, lagoon). Single strand conformation polymorphism analysis targeting the V3 region of 16S rDNA revealed between four to six distinct archaeal peaks per digester. The diversity of dominant Archaea in the 44 digesters was estimated as 23 different 16S rDNA sequences. Cloning of archaeal 16S rRNA genes from 11 distinct total genomic DNA, screening of clones by SSCP and the sequencing of 170 of them made it possible to characterize these SSCP peaks. All the sequences retrieved were members of the Euryarchaeaota subdomain. Furthermore, most of the sequences retrieved were very close to already known and cultivated strains or to environmental clones. The most frequent archaeal sequences were close to Methanosaeta concilii and to a 16S rDNA clone vadinDC06 located in the Methanobacterium clade (84% and 73% of digesters respectively). The other sequences were members of the Methanobacteriales and the Methanomicrobiales families. Only one sequence was far from any sequence of the database and it could be grouped with several sequences of environmental clones. Each digester harboured between two to nine archaeal sequences with only one of them corresponding to a putative acetate‐utilizing species. Furthermore, the process in the digesters appeared to play a part in the distribution of archaeal diversity.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2004.00616.x,0
171,Integrin Polymorphisms as Risk Factors for Thrombosis,"Introduction By the year 2020, ischemic heart disease will become the number one public health problem on the planet, surpassing lower respiratory infections, diarrheal disease, perinatal problems, and unipolar major depression.1 Acute myocardial infarction, the most feared complication of coronary artery disease, results from the formation of an occlusive thrombus at the site of a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. The 1990s have seen an increased awareness of the contribution of inherited disorders of hemostasis as risks for coronary thrombosis. Consideration for potential hypercoagulable states in patients with these disorders would seem justified, since, for example, the risk for an acute coronary event is considerably greater with an abnormally elevated fibrinogen level than with an elevated total cholesterol level.2,3 The clinical benefit of thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction provides further support for the importance of fibrin formation or dissolution in this setting.4,5 An appropriate hypercoagulable evaluation of an unusual arterial thrombosis, particularly in a young patient, would include assays for hyperhomocysteinemia, the lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, as well as assays for fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Currently, less evidence exists to support measurements of tissue plasminogen activator, von Willebrand factor (vWF), factors VII or XIII, or those factors associated with venous thrombosis, such as activated protein C resistance/factor V Leiden or deficiencies of antithrombin III, protein C, or protein S. There is also abundant evidence that platelet thrombi play a crucial role in the development of acute myocardial infarction. In 1974, Chandler et al summarized a series of pathologic studies examining coronary arteries of patients with acute myocardial infarction and reaffirmed the basic understanding that coronary artery thrombi can cause acute ischemia and myocardial infarction.6 DeWood et al provided in vivo evidence to corroborate pathologic data,7 and Trip et al correlated platelet hyperreactivity with coronary events and mortality in patients with established coronary artery disease.8 The clinical arena has also provided additional support for the central role of platelets in the acute ischemic coronary syndromes, myocardial infarction, and unstable angina. Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, and inhibitors of integrin αIIbβ3 (e.g., abciximab and integrilin) has demonstrated beneficial effects in a number of coronary artery disease settings.9-11 Platelet physiology is arbitrarily divided into phases of adhesion, activation, secretion, and aggregation. When arterial subendothelium is exposed, vWF molecules are rapidly localized to these areas, and the initial platelet contact with the wound is a tethering to this insoluble form of vWF via glycoprotein (GP) Ibα.12,13 Stable adhesion and platelet activation is then mediated through integrin α2β1 binding to exposed collagen and integrin αIIbβ3 binding to vWF and fibrinogen.14 Fibrinogen has multiple αIIbβ3 binding sites, and an expanding thrombus ensues when platelets aggregate via the intercellular bridging of fibrinogen and vWF binding to the activated conformation of αIIbβ3. Three platelet membrane glycoprotein receptors, αIIbβ3, α2β1, and GP Ib-IX, have highly interactive and additive adhesive effects, ultimately resulting in stable thrombus formation. Attempts to educate both physicians and the lay public about the so-called “traditional” risk factors for coronary artery disease and acute ischemic coronary syndromes have been successful,15 and there are now established preventive therapies, such as blood pressure control, cessation of cigarette smoking, and cholesterol lowering. Genetic variations confer a potent risk for coronary artery disease in many families, and, although these risks fall outside the domain of preventive medicine, an emerging concept in the field is that targeted genetic testing may be used to direct therapeutic decisions. Although inherited alterations of hemostatic factors are believed to be important in the development of acute ischemic coronary syndromes, until recently, inherited platelet risk factors had not been considered. This review will focus on the potential link between the genetic and platelet components of arterial thrombosis, in particular, coronary artery disease.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0037-1615851,0
172,Physiological and molecular characterization of flor yeasts: Polymorphism of flor yeast populations,"Abstract Yeast strains which form velum on the surface of Sherry wine during the aging process have been isolated and characterized. According to their metabolic and molecular features most of the yeasts that were isolated belong to different races of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (beticus, cheresiensis, montuliensis and rouxii ). Due to the conditions under which these yeasts were isolated, all strains have in common the capacity to develop a film as an adaptive mechanism which allows them to grow and survive in 15·5% vol. ethanol. All strains were prototrophs for amino acids and most vitamins but they gave different responses to the killer factor. However, whereas their physiological features were similar, they showed a great heterogeneity with regards to the nuclear and mitochondrial genome (mtDNA): DNA content per cell was quite variable (1·3 to 2n), electrophoretic karyotypes of nuclear genomes indicated a main pattern with some variations, and polymorphism shown by the mtDNA was very high. Under extreme conditions such as Sherry wine with 15·5% vol. ethanol, no fermentable sugar and an exclusively oxidative metabolism, cells hardly grow and the maintenance of a live population depends on survival and respiration, which in turn depend on the mtDNA. At the same time these environmental conditions are mutagenic for the mtDNA, causing an increase in variation. Thus, the polymorphism observed might reflect the enormous variability induced by the ethanol followed by the selection of those mtDNA sequences which make the mitochondria metabolically active under these conditions.",https://doi.org/10.1002/yea.320111408,0
173,Amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis identifies hybrids between two subspecies of warblers,"Abstract In the western Pyrenees (Southwest France and Northwest Spain), a narrow hybrid zone exists between the common chiffchaff Phylloscopus (collybita) collybita and the Iberian chiffchaff Phylloscopus (c.) brehmii . In this zone, which is approximately 20 km wide, mixed matings and individuals singing the songs of both taxa occur at substantial frequencies (24 and 8.6%, respectively), suggesting frequent hybridization. Previous studies have shown very weak mitochondrial gene flow ( Nm = 0.065), whereas four microsatellites suggested much higher nuclear gene flow ( Nm = 4.9). In this study we used the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method in order to identify hybrids and early backcrosses. We typed 91 birds from both allopatric and sympatric areas for 12 informative AFLP markers (of &gt; 141 polymorphic fragments), obtained by screening 13 AFLP primer combinations. These individuals were previously typed for song ( brehmii, collybita or mixed singers), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype and allelic genotypes at four microsatellite loci. Assignment tests demonstrated that in the zone of sympatry, a substantial number of intermediate genotypes existed among the birds previously believed to be pure collybita and brehmii , based on song and mtDNA haplotype. The majority of the mixed singers had intermediate genotypes. Our data suggest that the fraction of the adult population having a hybrid origin (hybrids or backcrosses) is in the order of 10%. With such a frequency of genetic hybrids, there would have been much more mtDNA introgression than observed, had female hybrids been perfectly fertile/viable. This result is consistent with male‐biased gene flow and Haldane’s rule.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.0962-1083.2001.01455.x,0
174,Essential Role of the Linear Ubiquitin Chain Assembly Complex in Lymphoma Revealed by Rare Germline Polymorphisms,"Constitutive activation of NF-κB is a hallmark of the activated B cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), owing to upstream signals from the B-cell receptor (BCR) and MYD88 pathways. The linear polyubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) attaches linear polyubiquitin chains to IκB kinase-γ, a necessary event in some pathways that engage NF-κB. Two germline polymorphisms affecting the LUBAC subunit RNF31 are rare among healthy individuals (∼1%) but enriched in ABC DLBCL (7.8%). These polymorphisms alter RNF31 α-helices that mediate binding to the LUBAC subunit RBCK1, thereby increasing RNF31-RBCK1 association, LUBAC enzymatic activity, and NF-κB engagement. In the BCR pathway, LUBAC associates with the CARD11-MALT1-BCL10 adapter complex and is required for ABC DLBCL viability. A stapled RNF31 α-helical peptide based on the ABC DLBCL-associated Q622L polymorphism inhibited RNF31-RBCK1 binding, decreased NF-κB activation, and killed ABC DLBCL cells, credentialing this protein-protein interface as a therapeutic target.We provide genetic, biochemical, and functional evidence that the LUBAC ubiquitin ligase is a therapeutic target in ABC DLBCL, the DLBCL subtype that is most refractory to current therapy. More generally, our findings highlight the role of rare germline-encoded protein variants in cancer pathogenesis.",https://doi.org/10.1158/2159-8290.cd-13-0915,0
175,Effects of Polymorphism on the Lipid Interaction of Human Apolipoprotein E,"ApoE exists as three common isoforms, apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4; apoE2 and apoE3 preferentially bind to high density lipoproteins, whereas apoE4 prefers very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). To understand the molecular basis for the different lipoprotein distributions of these isoforms in human plasma, we examined the lipid-binding properties of the apoE isoforms and some mutants using lipid emulsions. With both large (120 nm) and small (35 nm) emulsion particles, the binding affinity of apoE4 was much higher than that of apoE2 and apoE3, whereas the maximal binding capacities were similar among the three isoforms. The 22-kDa N-terminal fragment of apoE4 displayed a much higher binding capacity than did apoE2 and apoE3. The apoE4(E255A) mutant, which has no electrostatic interaction between Arg61 and Glu255, showed binding behavior similar to that of apoE3, indicating that N- and C-terminal domain interaction in apoE4 is responsible for its high affinity for lipid. In addition, the apoE3(P267A) mutant, which is postulated to contain a long α-helix in the C-terminal domain, had significantly decreased binding capacities for both sizes of emulsion particle, suggesting that the apoE4 preference for VLDL is not due to a stabilized long α-helical structure. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements showed that there is no significant difference in thermodynamic parameters for emulsion binding among the apoE isoforms. However, fluorescence measurements of 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid binding to apoE indicated that apoE4 has more exposed hydrophobic surface compared with apoE3 mainly due to the different tertiary organization of the C-terminal domain. The less organized structure in the C-terminal domain of apoE4 leads to the higher affinity for lipid, contributing to its preferential association with VLDL. In fact, we found that apoE4 binds to VLDL with higher affinity compared with apoE3. ApoE exists as three common isoforms, apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4; apoE2 and apoE3 preferentially bind to high density lipoproteins, whereas apoE4 prefers very low density lipoproteins (VLDL).

In fact, we found that apoE4 binds to VLDL with higher affinity compared with apoE3. Human apoE, a 34-kDa protein composed of 299 amino acids, plays an important role in lipoprotein metabolism and neurobiology through its interaction with the low density lipoprotein (LDL) 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein(s); HDL, high density lipoproteins; PC, phosphatidylcholine; ANS, 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. receptor family and cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (1Mahley R.W.

Lipidol. 1996; 7: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). ApoE exists in three major isoforms, apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4, each differing by cysteine and arginine at positions 112 and 158. ApoE3, the most common form, contains cysteine and arginine at these positions, respectively, whereas apoE2 contains cysteine and apoE4 contains arginine at both sites (5Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9077-9083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These differences have profound effects on the biological functions of apoE. Both apoE3 and apoE4 bind to the LDL receptor with high affinity, whereas apoE2 exhibits defective binding to the LDL receptor and is associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia (6Mahley R.W. Huang Y. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1933-1949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoE4 is associated with high plasma cholesterol level and an increased risk for both coronary heart disease and Alzheimer's disease (7Davignon J. Gregg R.E. Sing C.F. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 1-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Strittmatter W.J. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The apoE isoforms are further distinguished by their preferential distribution among lipoprotein classes: apoE4 prefers very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), whereas apoE2 and apoE3 prefer high density lipoproteins (HDL) (10Weisgraber K.H. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1503-1511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoE contains two independently folded functional domains: a 22-kDa N-terminal domain (residues 1–191) and a 10-kDa C-terminal domain (residues 222–299) (11Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11657-11666Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain exists in the lipid-free state as a four-helix bundle of amphipathic α-helices and contains the LDL receptor-binding region (residues 136–150 in helix 4) (13Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain has a high affinity for lipid and is responsible for lipoprotein binding (2Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Westerlund J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15745-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In apoE4, these two domains interact in a unique manner unlike in the other isoforms: Arg112 causes a rearrangement of the Arg61 side chain in the N-terminal domain of apoE4, allowing it to interact with Glu255 in the C-terminal domain (15Dong L.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19053-19057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This domain interaction in human apoE4 is responsible for the preferential association with VLDL and has been suggested to contribute to the accelerated catabolism of this isoform and, consequently, the increased cholesterol and LDL levels in plasma (9Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1485-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 16Dong L.M. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol.

Association of apoE with lipid is required for its high affinity binding to the LDL receptor (17Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4186-4190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of recent studies carried out to understand the molecular basis for this phenomenon indicated that the four-helix bundle in the N-terminal domain undergoes a conformational opening upon lipid binding, leading to the receptor-active conformation of apoE (18Raussens V.

In this conformation, the positive electrostatic potential in the receptor-binding region of apoE is enhanced, probably allowing its high affinity binding to the LDL receptor (22Lund-Katz S. Zaiou M.

In addition, we have recently shown that the two domains in apoE4 lead to two different lipid-bound conformations (open or closed four-helix bundle) on emulsion particles (24Saito H. Dhanasekaran P.

Chem. 2001; 276: 40949-40954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), providing a structural rationale for the variable receptor-binding activity displayed by lipoprotein-associated apoE (25Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Because the three isoforms of apoE exhibit different thermal and chemical stabilities (apoE4 < apoE3 < apoE2) (12Morrow J.A. Segall M.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Knapp M. Rupp B. Weisgraber K.H.

Indeed, the reactivity to dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes of the 22-kDa N-terminal fragments of the three isoforms tends to vary inversely with the stabilities of these fragments (27Segall M.L.

In this study, we examined further the lipid interaction of the three isoforms of apoE using lipoprotein-like emulsion particles to understand the molecular basis for the different lipoprotein distribution of apoE isoforms. In addition, to test the hypothesis that the domain interaction in apoE4 stabilizes an extended helical structure in the C terminus that targets a less curved VLDL surface (16Dong L.M. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19053-19057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 28Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V.

Materials—Egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (PC) and triolein were purchased from Sigma, and stock solutions were stored in chloroform/methanol (2:1) under nitrogen at -20 °C. [14C]Formaldehyde (40–60 Ci/mol) in distilled water was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. NaCNBH3 (Aldrich) was recrystallized from methylene chloride before use. 8-Anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Ultrapure guanidine hydrochloride was from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA). Bacteriological media were obtained from Fisher. The prokaryotic expression vector pET32a was from Novagen (Madison, WI), and the competent Escherichia coli strains BL21(DE3) and DH5α were from Invitrogen. PCR supplies and DNA purification kits were from QIAGEN Inc. (Chatsworth, CA). Restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, β-mercaptoethanol, aprotinin, and ampicillin were from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were from IDT (Coralville, IA). All other salts and reagents were analytical grade. Lipoprotein and Apolipoproteins—VLDL was isolated from fasting normolipidemic human plasma by ultracentrifugation at a density cut of 1.006 g/ml. Examination by agarose gel electrophoresis showed that the VLDL had pre-β mobility and that it was not contaminated with either chylomicrons or LDL. SDS-PAGE showed the expected presence of apoB-100, apoC, and apoE. Gel filtration chromatography (29Boyle K.E. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 302-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the VLDL particles had diameters in the range of 25–60 nm. Full-length human apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4 and their 22- and 10-kDa fragments were expressed and purified as described (24Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C.

The mutations in apoE3(P267A) and apoE4(E255A) were introduced using PCR to create DNA inserts that were ligated into a thioredoxin fusion expression vector (pET32a) as described (30Morrow J.A.

The mutation, sequence, and cDNA orientation were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and double-stranded DNA sequencing. The resulting fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli, cleaved, and purified as described (30Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Weisgraber K.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The purity of the proteins was monitored by SDS-PAGE (8–25% gradient) with an Amersham Biosciences Phast electrophoresis system. Protein concentrations were determined by the procedure of Lowry et al. (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of ApoE to Emulsion or VLDL Particles—Triolein/egg PC emulsion particles were prepared by sonication and purified by ultracentrifugation as described (24Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F.

The average particle diameter determined by quasi-elastic light scattering measurements was 120 ± 10 nm for large emulsions and 35 ± 5 nm for small emulsions. The binding of apoE to emulsion particles at room temperature was assayed with a centrifugation method as described (24Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C.

In VLDL binding experiments, the incubation mixtures of 14C-labeled apoE and human VLDL (0.3 mg/ml phospholipid) were centrifuged under the same conditions as in the case of small emulsions. Binding data were fitted by nonlinear regression to a one-binding site model with the GraphPAD Prism program. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) Measurements—Heats of apoE binding to emulsions were measured with a MicroCal MCS isothermal titration calorimeter at 25 °C as described (24Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40949-40954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The reactant was placed in the sample cell (1.35 ml) and titrated with 8–10-μl aliquots of the injectant with continual stirring at 400 rpm. To measure the enthalpy of binding at a low surface concentration, apoE solutions were injected into emulsions in the cell at a PC/protein molar ratio of >10,000, at which the injected protein binds completely to the emulsion surface (normal injection). For reverse injection, emulsions were injected into excess apoE (PC/protein ratio < 40), where the emulsion surface appears to be saturated with apoE. Heats of dilution were determined in control experiments by injecting either apoE solution or emulsions into buffer, and these heats were subtracted from the heats determined in the corresponding apoE/emulsion binding experiments. The decay rate constants for the heats of binding were obtained by fitting the titration curves to a one- or two-phase exponential decay model. ANS Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence measurements were obtained with a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer at 25 °C. The apoE sample was freshly dialyzed from 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 1% β-mercaptoethanol solution into Tris buffer (pH 7.4) before use. ANS fluorescence spectra were collected from 400 to 600 nm at an excitation wavelength of 395 nm in the presence of 50 μg/ml protein and 250 μm ANS. Under these conditions, ANS was in at least 100-fold excess to the protein (mol/mol). Binding of ApoE Isoforms to Emulsion Particles—Previously, we determined the parameters for binding of apoE4 and its 22- and 10-kDa fragments to emulsion particles using an ultracentrifugal separation (24Saito H.

In this study, we applied this method to compare the lipid-binding properties of the three isoforms. As shown in Fig. 1, both full-length apoE2 and apoE3 displayed saturable binding to large emulsions, similar to the behavior of full-length apoE4, whereas the 22-kDa fragments of apoE2 and apoE3 hardly bound to the emulsion surface. The dissociation constant (K d) and the maximal binding capacity (B max) for small and large emulsion particles are listed in Table I. In the case of the full-length proteins, apoE2 and apoE3 displayed much lower binding affinity for both emulsions compared with apoE4, whereas the binding capacities of the three isoforms were similar for both emulsion particle sizes. The binding parameters for full-length apoE3 were comparable to the previously reported data for human apoE3 (34Yokoyama S. Kawai Y. Tajima S. Yamamoto A. J. Biol.

Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19053-19057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To explore whether this hypothesis can be applied to the different lipid-binding behaviors of apoE3 and apoE4, we examined the lipid-binding properties of two apoE mutants, apoE3(P267A) and apoE4(E255A). ApoE3(P267A) is postulated to have a long α-helix in its C terminus because the mutation P267A is likely to remove the interruption or kink between predicted helices 225–266 and 268–289 (28Segrest J.P.

The mutation E255A in apoE4 is known to alter the apoE4 preference from VLDL to HDL by disrupting the domain interaction (16Dong L.M. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol.

Fig. 2 shows the binding isotherms of these mutants for small emulsions in comparison with the isotherms of the respective wild-type proteins; the binding parameters for both sizes of emulsion particles are summarized in Fig. 3. The mutation E255A in apoE4 reduced the lipid affinity without changing the binding capacity for both emulsions; and, as a result, the apoE4(E255A) mutant bound in a similar manner compared with wild-type apoE3 rather than apoE4, indicating that the domain interaction in apoE4 is responsible for its high affinity for lipid. In contrast, the apoE3(P267A) mutant displayed a much lower binding capacity compared with wild-type apoE3 regardless of the emulsion particle size, suggesting that helical length in the C terminus is not responsible for the different lipid-binding behavior of apoE3 and apoE4.Fig. 3Comparison of binding parameters among full-length apoE variants.

Fig. 4 shows the injections of full-length proteins and the 22-kDa fragments of apoE isoforms into large emulsions. Using the binding constants given in Table I and Fig. 3, the thermodynamic parameters for binding of apoE isoforms and mutants to small and large emulsions were obtained (Table II). As previously reported for apoE4 (24Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40949-40954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), binding of apoE isoforms and mutants to large particles was an exothermic process, but binding to small particles was much less exothermic or rather endothermic. As a result, the binding to large particles is enthalpically driven, whereas that to small particles is entropically driven. There was no significant difference in the thermodynamic binding parameters among the full-length apoE isoforms. In contrast, the enthalpies of binding of the 22-kDa fragments of apoE2 and apoE3 to large emulsions were much less exothermic than that of the apoE4 22-kDa fragment. In addition, the slow decay of ITC curves for full-length proteins and the apoE4 22-kDa fragment (half-life = 1.6–2.0 min) that appears to reflect opening of the N-terminal four-helix bundle (24Saito H.

These results suggest that the 22-kDa fragments of apoE2 and apoE3 cannot bind to the emulsion surface with the four-helix bundle in an open conformation (20Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the enthalpies of binding of mutants apoE3(P267A) and apoE4(E255A) to large emulsions were much reduced compared with the wild-type proteins, suggesting that proper arrangements of charged or helical residues in the C-terminal domain are critical to the favorable enthalpy of binding to large particles.Table IIThermodynamic parameters of binding of apoE isoforms and variants to emulsion particles at 25 °C35-nm emulsion120-nm emulsionΔHΔG aFree energy was calculated according to ΔG = —RT ln 55.5(1/Kd) using the binding constants given in Table I and Fig. 3.ΔS bThe entropy of binding was calculated from ΔG = ΔH— TΔS.ΔHΔG aFree energy was calculated according to ΔG = —RT ln 55.5(1/Kd) using the binding constants given in Table I and Fig. 3.ΔS bThe entropy of binding was calculated from ΔG = ΔH— TΔS.kcal/molkcal/molcal/mol Kkcal/molkcal/molcal/mol KApoE25.2 ± 1.9—10.8 ± 0.254 ± 7—64.3 ± 5.5—10.9 ± 0.1—177 ± 19ApoE3—0.9 ± 0.5—11.0 ± 0.134 ± 2—66.6 ± 7.1—10.9 ± 0.1—187 ± 23ApoE4cData are from Saito et al.

176,Ethnicity-dependent Polymorphism in Na+-taurocholate Cotransporting Polypeptide (SLC10A1) Reveals a Domain Critical for Bile Acid Substrate Recognition,"The key transporter responsible for hepatic uptake of bile acids from portal circulation is Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP, SLC10A1). This transporter is thought to be critical for the maintenance of enterohepatic recirculation of bile acids and hepatocyte function. Therefore, functionally relevant polymorphisms in this transporter would be predicted to have an important impact on bile acid homeostasis/liver function. However, little is known regarding genetic heterogeneity in NTCP. In this study, we demonstrate the presence of multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms in NTCP in populations of European, African, Chinese, and Hispanic Americans. Specifically four nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with a significant loss of transport function were identified. Cell surface biotinylation experiments indicated that the altered transport activity of T668C (Ile223 → Thr), a variant seen only in African Americans, was due at least in part to decreased plasma membrane expression. Similar expression patterns were observed when the variant alleles were expressed in HepG2 cells, and plasma membrane expression was assessed using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Interestingly the C800T (Ser267 → Phe) variant, seen only in Chinese Americans, exhibited a near complete loss of function for bile acid uptake yet fully normal transport function for the non-bile acid substrate estrone sulfate, suggesting this position may be part of a region in the transporter critical and specific for bile acid substrate recognition. Accordingly, our study indicates functionally important polymorphisms in NTCP exist and that the likelihood of being carriers of such polymorphisms is dependent on ethnicity.

Accordingly, our study indicates functionally important polymorphisms in NTCP exist and that the likelihood of being carriers of such polymorphisms is dependent on ethnicity. Bile acids, synthesized from the enzymatic catabolism of cholesterol, are the major solutes in bile, essential for the maintenance of bile flow and biliary lipid secretion (1St. Pierre M.V. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 1673-1686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, an important mechanism for cholesterol homeostasis occurs through its elimination in the form of bile acids. Indeed de novo synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol is thought to account for nearly half of the daily elimination of cholesterol from the body (1St. Pierre M.V. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 1673-1686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the gastrointestinal tract, bile acids also modulate the release of pancreatic secretions and gastrointestinal peptides and activate enzymes required for the absorption of lipid-soluble vitamins (2Koop I. Schindler M. Bosshammer A. Scheibner J. Stange E. Koop H. Gut. 1996; 39: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 3Riepl R.L. Fiedler F. Ernstberger M. Teufel J. Lehnert P. Eur. J. Med. Res. 1996; 1: 499-505PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, their detergent properties assist solubilization of cholesterol and dietary fats in the intestine. Bile salts are efficiently reabsorbed in the small intestine and are returned to the liver via the portal circulation and resecreted into bile, thus forming an enterohepatic circuit (4Trauner M. Boyer J.L. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 633-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). The efficient enterohepatic recirculation of bile acids is maintained by polarized expression of bile acid uptake and efflux transporters in the intestine and liver (4Trauner M. Boyer J.L. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 633-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Moreover, taurine or glycine conjugates of bile acids tend to be polar and hydrophilic, thus dependent on transporter proteins for cellular uptake and efflux (5Hofmann A.F. Feldman M. Scharschmidt B.F. Sleisenger M.H. Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease. Saunders, Philadelphia1998: 937-948Google Scholar). In the liver, it is estimated that Na+-dependent transport pathways account for greater than 80% of the hepatic uptake of conjugated bile acids such as taurocholate (6Muller M. Jansen P.L. J. Hepatol. 1998; 28: 344-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 7Anwer M.S. Hegner D. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1978; 359: 181-192PubMed Google Scholar, 8Scharschmidt B.F.

The transporter responsible for the observed Na+-dependent uptake of conjugated bile salts is Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP, 1The abbreviations used are: NTCP, Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; ISBT, ileal Na+-dependent bile acid transporter; BSEP, bile salt export pump; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: NTCP, Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; ISBT, ileal Na+-dependent bile acid transporter; BSEP, bile salt export pump; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. SLC10A1) (11Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Foguet M. Lubbert H. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10629-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 12Cattori V. Eckhardt U.

Med. 1997; 70: 331-340PubMed Google Scholar), is expressed exclusively in the liver and localized to the basolateral membrane of the hepatocyte (16Stieger B. Hagenbuch B. Landmann L. Hochli M. Schroeder A. Meier P.J. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 1781-1787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human NTCP gene encodes a 349-amino acid protein (14Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and shares 77% amino acid sequence identity with rat Ntcp (17Meier P.J. Eckhardt U. Schroeder A. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Hagenbuch et al. (18Hagenbuch B. Scharschmidt B.F. Meier P.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 901-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) demonstrated that, when Xenopus laevis oocytes were coinjected with total rat liver mRNA and antisense oligonucleotides specific to Ntcp, the expressed Na+-dependent taurocholate transport activity was reduced by 95%. This finding suggests a potentially central role for Ntcp in the hepatic uptake of bile acids. Accordingly, the extent of its expression or function would be predicted to significantly affect enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and directly affect cellular signaling pathways importantly involved in cholesterol homeostasis and hepatocyte function. One potential source of altered NTCP function may be genetic heterogeneity in this transporter related to the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs. Indeed, functional polymorphisms are known to exist among bile acid transporter family members. For example, mutations in the ileal Na+-dependent bile acid transporter (ISBT, SLC10A2) have been identified (19Oelkers P. Kirby L.C. Heubi J.E. Dawson P.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This transporter, expressed on the apical surface of ileal enterocytes and mediating the Na+-dependent uptake of conjugated and unconjugated bile acids in the intestine (20Craddock A.L. Love M.W.

Interestingly, certain loss of function mutations in the coding regions of ISBT result in a syndrome of primary bile acid malabsorption (19Oelkers P. Kirby L.C. Heubi J.E. Dawson P.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), characterized by severe diarrhea, malabsorption of fat, and malnutrition. Furthermore, a number of mutations in the bile salt export pump (BSEP, ABCB11), the ATP-dependent bile salt efflux transporter localized to the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes (25Gerloff T.

However, little is known regarding genetic heterogeneity in NTCP. The only published data to date have been a report of two SNPs in the coding region of NTCP in the Japanese population, conducted as a part of a large scale SNP discovery effort but lacking any functional studies of identified SNPs (28Saito S. Iida A. Sekine A. Ogawa C. Kawauchi S. Higuchi S. Nakamura Y. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 47: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Clearly, loss of function mutations in NTCP, if found to be present, would significantly add to our knowledge of the genetic basis of altered bile acid absorption, cholesterol elimination, and hepatocyte function. In this report we present data that support the presence of ethnicity-dependent functionally deleterious polymorphisms in NTCP. Moreover, functional studies indicate the presence of a discrete region within NTCP that is essential for bile acid substrate recognition. Materials—[3H]Taurocholate (3.4 Ci/mmol, >97% purity), unlabeled taurocholate, [3H]cholate (55 Ci/mmol, >97% purity), unlabeled cholate, [3H]estrone sulfate (53 Ci/mmol, >97% purity), and unlabeled estrone sulfate were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Recombinant vaccinia virus containing the T7 RNA polymerase gene (vtf-7) was a gift provided by Dr. Bernard Moss (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The pEF6/V5-His-TOPO® expression vector was purchased from Invitrogen. The monoclonal mouse anti-V5 antibody was purchased from Invitrogen. Human liver samples were kindly provided by Dr. F. P. Guengerich at our institution. Genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy European American, African American, Chinese American, and Hispanic American volunteers was purchased from Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ). All other chemical and reagents, unless stated otherwise, were obtained from Sigma and were of the highest grade available. Identification of SNPs in NTCP—Initially, total genomic DNA was isolated from human liver samples (Nashville Regional Organ Procurement Agency, Nashville, TN) from 20 European American donors without any history of underlying liver pathology or prior medications via the DNeasy® tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and quantified using an MBA 2000 mass spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of 30 additional European American, 50 African American, and 50 Chinese American healthy volunteers was obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories. A 226-kilobase bacterial artificial chromosome clone (CNS01RG6) containing the complete intron-exon boundaries for the human NTCP gene was identified from the Human Genome Project (GenBank™). Primer pairs to amplify each of the five exonic regions of NTCP were designed and are as follows: exon 1, forward 5′-GAACTGCACAAGAAACGGAGTC-3′ and reverse 5′-GCTCTTCCCCTCAATTGTGAC-3′; exon 2, forward 5′-GCACTTAGCAGGCACTCAAC-3′ and reverse 5′-GACAGTGAATCCTTAGAGTGC-3′; exon 3, forward 5′-CCAATTTCTACCTGTGCTTCC-3′ and reverse 5′-CTGCAGTGAGCTGAGAATGTG-3′; exon 4, forward 5′-CAGCACTGGGACAAAGTTGC-3′ and reverse 5′-GGCTCAGGTCTAATATTGGAG-3′; exon 5, forward 5′-CACACTCTAGGGCTGAGTTG-3′ and reverse 5′-GCTTCTTGGGTAGACACCCTGTC-3′. Using a GeneAmp® PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), PCR was carried out using ∼200 ng of human liver genomic DNA for European American subjects or ∼25 ng of genomic DNA (Coriell Cell Repositories) previously digested with the restriction endonuclease XhoI (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) for additional European Americans and all African American and Chinese American subjects consisting of dNTPs (0.25 mm each), the specific primer pair (4 μm each), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq® DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a final reaction volume of 50 μl. PCR was generally carried out at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 20 s for 30 cycles with the exception of exon 2, which was carried out at 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 10 s for 30 cycles. PCR products of expected sizes were completely visualized using ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gels and were fully sequenced in all subjects with an ABI 3700 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems). SNPs were identified utilizing the computer software program AlignX (Vector NTI, Version 7.0, InforMax, Inc., Frederick, MD) and confirmed by direct visualization of the sequences. A search of available SNP data bases 2Data bases included IMS-JST Japanese SNP (snp.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), dbSNP (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db = snp), PharmGKB (www.pharmgkb.org), and GeneCards™ (bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/cards/). was performed to identify any additional polymorphisms. Wild-type and Variant NTCP Plasmid Construction—The full open reading frame of human NTCP cDNA was obtained by PCR using AmpliTaq® DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) from a cDNA library synthesized from human liver mRNA using oligonucleotide primers 5′-ATGGAGGCCCACAACGCGTCT-3′ as the forward and 5′-CTAGGCTGTGCAAGGGGA-3′ as the reverse. A single PCR product of expected size was visualized on an ethidium bromide-stained 1.2% agarose gel. An aliquot of the PCR product was ligated into the pEF6/V5-His-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen). After transformation and growth in Escherichia coli, individual colonies containing the pEF6/V5-His-TOPO®/NTCP construct were identified. A pEF6/V5-His-TOPO®/NTCP with the NTCP cDNA inserted in the sense orientation downstream from the T7 promoter region was fully sequenced using an ABI 3700 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc.) and found to fully match the published reference sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_003049) (14Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). This clone was termed NTCP*1. Site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to create the identified nonsynonymous allelic variants: C800T and T836C identified from Chinese American samples, A940G identified from a Hispanic American sample, and T668C identified from African American samples. The appropriate point mutations were introduced individually into wild-type NTCP (*1) packaged into pEF6/V5-His-TOPO® using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the following oligonucleotide primers: C800T, forward 5′-CAAAATGTCCAACTCTGTTTCACCATCCTCAATGTGGCCTTTC-3′ and reverse 5′-GAAAGGCCACATTGAGGATGGTGAAACAGAGTTGGACATTTTG-3′; T668C, forward 5′-GCCATGACACCACTCTTGACTGCCACCTCCTCCCTGATG-3′ and reverse 5′-CATCAGGGAGGAGGTGGCAGTCAAGAGTGGTGTCATGGC-3′; T836C, forward 5′-GGCCTTTCCACCTGAAGTCACTGGACCACTTTTCTTCTTTC-3′ and reverse 5′-GAAAGAAGAAAAGTGGTCCAGTGACTTCAGGTGGAAAGGCC-3′; A940G, forward 5′-GAGAAATTCAAGACTCCCGAGGATAAAACAAAAATG-3′ and reverse 5′-CATTTTTGTTTTATCCTCGGGAGTCTTGAATTTCTC-3′. The presence of the mutations was verified by full sequencing. Wild-type and variant NTCP were renamed the following for expression studies: wild-type, NTCP*1; C800T, NTCP*2; T668C, NTCP*3; T836C, NTCP*4; and A940G, NTCP*5. Determination of Genotypic Frequencies—Direct sequencing of PCR products was performed to determine the genotypic frequencies of the nonsynonymous polymorphisms C800T, T668C, T836C, and A940G. PCR was carried out as previously described utilizing genomic DNA digested previously with the restriction endonuclease XhoI (New England Biolabs, Inc.) from a total of 90 European American, 90 African American, 90 Hispanic American, and 100 Chinese American healthy volunteers (Coriell Cell Repositories) with primers to amplify exon 3 and exon 4 of the NTCP gene. Single PCR products of expected sizes were visualized on ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gels. PCR products were fully sequenced in all subjects using an ABI 3700 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Allele frequencies were calculated based upon the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Cell Culture and Virus Preparation—HeLa (American Type Culture Collection) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For preparation of a viral stock of vtf-7 virus, HeLa cells grown to near confluency in 25-cm tissue culture plates were infected with 1 plaque-forming unit/10 cells. After an incubation period of 48 h at 37 °C, the infected cells were pelleted, homogenized, and recovered through centrifugation followed by titering of viral stock as described by Blakely et al.

Human hepatoma (American Type Culture Collection) cells (HepG2) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For transient transfection, cells were grown on sterile uncoated 35-mm glass-bottomed microwell dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) and transfected at 70-80% confluency with 4 μg of V5-tagged NTCP plasmid DNA (NTCP*1, -*2, or -*3) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 h, cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Transport Studies Using Recombinant Vaccinia Virus—HeLa cells grown in 12-well plates (∼0.8 × 106 cells/well) were infected with vaccinia (vtf-7) at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell in serum-free Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen) and allowed to adsorb for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells in each well were then transfected with 1 μg of wild-type or variant NTCP cDNA packaged into pEF6/V5-His-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen) along with Lipofectin® (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The parental plasmid lacking any insert was used as control. Transport was then evaluated using labeled substrates as outlined previously (30Kim R.B. Leake B. Cvetkovic M. Roden M.M. Nadeau J. Walubo A. Wilkinson G.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 1204-1209PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the taurocholate, cholate, and estrone sulfate transport kinetics, radiolabeled substrate uptake during the linear phase (first 3 min) was assessed in the presence of various concentrations of unlabeled compound. Passive diffusion was determined by carrying out parallel experiments using the parental plasmid DNA lacking the transporter cDNA, and this value was then subtracted from the total uptake rate seen in the presence of the transporter cDNA. Michaelis-Menten-type nonlinear curve fitting was carried out to obtain estimates of the maximal uptake rate (Vmax) and the concentration at which half the maximal uptake occurs (Km) (Prism™, GraphPad, San Diego, CA). All experiments were carried out in duplicate on at least 2-3 experimental days. Epitope-tagged Wild-type and Variant NTCP Construction—Because of a lack of a high affinity antibody to human NTCP, we utilized a 14-amino acid epitope (V5) in the pEF6/V5-His-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen) to generate V5-tagged wild-type and variant NCTP proteins. The QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to introduce a point mutation that converted the stop codon of NTCP to a lysine residue (TAG → AAG) utilizing the following oligonucleotide sense and antisense primers: 5′-CTGCTCCCCTTGCACAGCCAAGAAGGGCAATTCTGCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGCAGAATTGCCCTTCTTGGCTGTGCAAGGGGAGCAG-3′. The presence of the mutation was verified by full sequencing. The V5 tag was generated for wild-type NTCP and each of the nonsynonymous NTCP variants, and these were used for characterization of total protein and cell surface expression. NTCP Expression in HeLa Cells—HeLa cells transfected with NTCP cDNA tagged with the V5 epitope were scraped off plates, and the resulting suspension was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 3 min. The cell pellet was reconstituted with HED buffer (25 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science) and lysed by sonication. Samples were diluted with Laemmli buffer, and 3.75 μg of total cell protein were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels. Following transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, blots were probed with a monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (1:5000 dilution) (Invitrogen) and appropriate secondary antibody. To normalize sample loading, blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-calnexin antibody (StressGen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). NTCP Cell Surface Expression—HeLa cells were grown on 6-well plates and transfected with the NTCP cDNAs tagged with the V5 epitope using a similar protocol for transport experiments. Sixteen hours post-transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline Ca2+/Mg2+ (138 mm NaCl2, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 9.6 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.3) and then treated with a membrane-impermeable biotinylating agent (sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-SS-biotin, 1.5 mg/ml, Pierce) at 4 °C for 1 h. Subsequently the cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline Ca2+/Mg2+ containing 100 mm glycine and then incubated for 20 min at 4 °C with the same buffer to remove the remaining labeling agent. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline Ca2+/Mg2+, cells were disrupted with 700 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris base, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C for 1 h with constant agitation. Following centrifugation, 140 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) was added to 600 μl of cell lysate and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Beads were washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and the biotinylated proteins were released by incubation of the beads with 2× Laemmli buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Similar to total cell lysates, samples of the biotinylated fractions (25 μl) were subjected to Western analysis for detection of immunodetectable NTCP with monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (1:5000 dilution) and the intracellular, endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein calnexin as described previously. Deglycosylation of Total and Cell Surface-expressed NTCP—HeLa cells were grown on 6-well plates and transfected with the wild-type NTCP cDNA tagged with the V5 epitope using a protocol similar to that for transport experiments. Total and cell-surface expressed fractions of wild-type NTCP (*1) were isolated as described previously and subjected to enzymatic deglycosylation (Glyko, San Leandro, CA). Briefly 15 μl of total or cell-surface expressed NTCP*1 was dissolved in 30 μl of deionized water. 10 μl of 5× incubation buffer (0.25 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) and 2.5 μl of denaturation solution (2% SDS and 1 m β-mercaptoethanol) were added to the proteins, gently mixed, and incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. After cooling to room temperature, 2.5 μl of detergent solution (15% Nonidet P-40) was added to the proteins. Then 1 μl each of N-glycanase, sialidase A, and O-glycanase or 3 μl of water (control) was added to the proteins and subsequently incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Samples were diluted with 2× Laemmli buffer and subjected to Western analysis by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels for detection of immunodetectable NTCP with monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (1:5000 dilution). Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—HepG2 cells transiently transfected with V5-tagged NTCP plasmid DNA were fixed for 10 min in ice-cold 70% methanol. After a 5-min wash in PBS, cells were permeabilized for 10 min in PBT (0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS, pH 7.4). After a 5-min wash in PBS, cells were placed in blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated in primary antibody (anti-V5 antibody diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer) for 2 h at room temperature. After three 5-min washes in PBST (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4), cells were then incubated with secondary fluorescent dye (Texas Red)-labeled goat anti-mouse whole antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C. After three 5-min washes in PBST, cells were placed in PBS and viewed by confocal microscopy. HepG2 cells transfected with plasmid alone and cells transfected with V5-tagged NTCP wild-type plasmid DNA without incubation in primary antibody were used as two separate controls. Confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss Axiovert 100-M inverted microscope equipped with a LSM510 laser scanning unit. A Zeiss 63× 1.4 numerical aperture plan Apochromat oil immersion objective was used for all experiments. Confocal images were obtained using single excitation (595 nm) and emission (610-630 nm Texas Red) filter sets. For slow frame scanning, confocal images were obtained by scanning either laterally (top view, x-y scans) or axially (side view, x-z scans) across the cell. Image analysis and processing were performed with Zeiss LSM and Adobe Photoshop software. Statistical Analysis—Determination of the statistical differences between various group parameters was determined using either Student's t test, Mann-Whitney U test, analysis of variance (using Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test), or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. A p value of <0.05 was taken to be the minimum level of statistical significance. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in NTCP—To identify coding region SNPs, initial screening PCR was performed on all five exons of NTCP from genomic DNA samples of 50 European Americans, 50 African Americans, and 50 Chinese Americans and analyzed by direct sequencing. Obtained sequences were compared with the published NTCP reference sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_003049). Two nonsynonymous SNPs were identified by direct sequencing of PCR products from this initial screening of genomic DNA samples. The allelic variant C800T (Ser267 → Phe), in exon 4 of NTCP, was observed in 6 of 50 Chinese American DNA samples but was not seen in European Americans or African Americans (Fig. 1B). Another allelic variant T668C (Ile223 → Thr), in exon 3 of NTCP, was identified in 4 of 50 African American DNA samples but not seen in European Americans",https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m305782200,0
177,Social pairing and female mating fidelity predicted by restriction fragment length polymorphism similarity at the major histocompatibility complex in a songbird,"Female birds often copulate outside the pair-bond to produce broods of mixed paternity, but despite much recent attention the adaptive significance of this behaviour remains elusive. Although several studies support the idea that extra-pair copulations (EPCs) allow females to obtain 'good genes' for their offspring, many others have found no relationship between female mating fidelity and traits likely to reflect male quality. A corollary to the good genes hypothesis proposes that females do use EPCs to increase the quality of young, but it is the interaction between maternal and paternal genomes - and not male quality per se - that is the target of female choice. We tested this 'genetic compatibility' hypothesis in a free-living population of Savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) by determining whether females mated nonrandomly with respect to the major histocompatibility complex (Mhc). During both the 1994 and 1995 breeding seasons, female yearlings (but not older birds) avoided pairing with Mhc-similar males (P < 0.005). The Mhc similarity between mates also predicted the occurrence of extra-pair young in first broods (P < 0.007) and covaried with estimates of genome-wide levels of similarity derived from multilocus DNA fingerprinting profiles (P = 0.007). The overall genetic similarity between adults tended to predict female mating fidelity, but with less precision than their Mhc similarity (P = 0.09). In contrast, females appeared insensitive to the size, weight or age of males, none of which explained variation in female mating fidelity. Taken together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that females sought complementary genes for their offspring and suggest either that the benefits of heterozygosity (at the Mhc) drive female mating patterns or that the avoidance of inbreeding is an ultimate cause of social and genetic mate choice in Savannah sparrows.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-294x.2003.01968.x,0
178,The Influenza A Virus Protein NS1 Displays Structural Polymorphism,"ABSTRACT NS1 of influenza A virus is a potent antagonist of host antiviral interferon responses. This multifunctional protein with two distinctive domains, an RNA-binding domain (RBD) and an effector domain (ED) separated by a linker region (LR), is implicated in replication, pathogenesis, and host range. Although the structures of individual domains of NS1 from different strains of influenza viruses have been reported, the only structure of full-length NS1 available to date is from an H5N1 strain (A/Vietnam/1203/2004). By carrying out crystallographic analyses of full-length H6N6-NS1 (A/blue-winged teal/MN/993/1980) and an LR deletion mutant, combined with mutational analysis, we show here that these full-length NS1 structures provide an exquisite structural sampling of various conformational states of NS1 that based on the orientation of the ED with respect to RBD can be summarized as “open,” “semi-open,” and “closed” conformations. Our studies show that preference for these states is clearly dictated by determinants such as linker length, residue composition at position 71, and a mechanical hinge, providing a structural basis for strain-dependent functional variations in NS1. Because of the flexibility inherent in the LR, any particular NS1 could sample the conformational space around these states to engage ED in different quaternary interactions so that it may participate in specific protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions to allow for the known multifunctionality of NS1. We propose that such conformational plasticity provides a mechanism for autoregulating NS1 functions, depending on its temporal distribution, posttranslational modifications, and nuclear or cellular localization, during the course of virus infection. IMPORTANCE NS1 of influenza A virus is a multifunctional protein associated with numerous strain-specific regulatory functions during viral infection, including conferring resistance to antiviral interferon induction, replication, pathogenesis, virulence, and host range. NS1 has two domains, an RNA-binding domain and an effector domain separated by a linker. To date, the only full-length NS1 structure available is that from an H5N1 strain (A/Vietnam/1203/2004). Here, we determined crystal structures of the wild type and a linker region mutant of the H6N6 NS1 (A/blue-winged teal/MN/993/1980), which together with the previously determined H5N1 NS1 structure show that NS1 exhibits significant strain-dependent structural polymorphism due to variations in linker length, residue composition at position 71, and a mechanical hinge. Such a structural polymorphism may be the basis for strain-specific functions associated with NS1.",https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03692-13,0
179,PROTEIN POLYMORPHISM IN THE NARROW ENDEMIC <i>OENOTHERA ORGANENSIS</i>,"Oenothera organensis Munz has been an enigma because of its small population size but rich self-incompatibility (S) gene polymorphism. This perennial is known solely from the Organ Mountains, New Mexico, at elevations between 6,000 and 7,500 ft; and occupies an area of about 18 sq. mi. Emerson (1939, 1940) sampled four populations and found over 45 S-alleles whose distribution was rather homogeneous. Forty-five alleles is very high in view of Emerson's notion that the total population of Oe. organensis was less than 500 plants. There have been several attempts to explain how so many alleles each could be maintained at a low frequency in a species, with so few individuals (Wright, 1939, 1960, 1965; Fisher, 1958; Moran, 1962; Crosby, 1966). Is this very narrow endemic (rich in Salleles) rich or depauperate in genetic variation at other loci? Moreover is the spatial organization of variation at other loci similar to that at the S-locus? The purpose of our study was to obtain answers to these questions. As a prelude to stating our expectations and considering our findings, it is important to recognize a number of aspects of the ecology of the species. Recent exploration of the Organ Mountains by Ritter revealed that Oe. organensis is abundant in canyons that have good drainage. All of the populations known to date, and locations where others are likely, are noted in Figure 1. The species may be composed of 5,000 plants. The largest number of plants occur on the east side of the mountains which is rather mesic in many areas. The dispersal of pollen within and among populations is accomplished by strongflying hawkmoths (Hyles lineata, Manduca quinquemaculata, Sphinx chersis). Seeds have no obvious special dispersal adaptations. Local dispersal presumably is by water and small mammals or birds. Interpopulation seed dispersal is probably accomplished by deer, which heavily browse inflorescences and capsules. The sites of Oenothera are the only watering holes for deer in their peregrinations over ridges between canyons. Given the information on S-locus polymorphism, the distribution of populations and the type of pollen and seed vectors, what may we expect to find for the genome as a whole? Clearly S-allele polymorphism is not indicative of overall genetic variation. Polymorphism at the Slocus is protected in part through frequency-dependent selection; the rare alleles tend to be at an advantage (Wright, 1969). This form of selection tends to retard the decay of genetic variability and insure the retention of at least a few alleles. At other loci, the decay of variability is likely to be rapid, being dictated by the size and number of populations and the amount of isolation and differential selection between the populations. If there is little genetic subdivision of the species, as is suggested by the S-alleles, then the species would be a rather poor repository for genetic variation (Wright, 1948, 1951). In view of its narrow endemism, we hypothesize that Oe. organensis is monomorphic at most allozyme loci and has few alleles at polymorphic loci. The spatial distribution of alleles at other loci is likely to be governed by the same factors operative on S-alleles, especially the pollen and seed flow distributions. Since pollen is carried by strong",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1979.tb04708.x,0
180,"TROPHIC POLYMORPHISM AND BEHAVIORAL DIFFERENCES DECREASE INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION IN A CICHLID, HERICHTHYS MINCKLEYI","Resource polymorphisms, or morphological variations related to resource use, are common in fishes and are thought to be a possible step in speciation. This study experimentally tests the hypothesis that fitness (as estimated by growth rates) is increased by the presence of multiple trophic morphotypes (or morphs) within a population. Cage experiments were used to quantify the intraspecific competitive interactions between morphs of the polymorphic cichlid Herichthys minckleyi in Cuatro Ciénegas, Mexico. Results suggest that competition is reduced between morphs in mixed-morph treatments relative to equal-density single-morph treatments. Field studies revealed that the morphs feed in different microhabitats and use different feeding behaviors within these microhabitats. These results suggest that the polymorphism is maintained in the population because it decreases competition between the morphs, and that differences in feeding behavior facilitate resource partitioning.

181,A review of colour and pattern polymorphisms in anurans,"Species that exhibit polymorphism, the simultaneous occurrence of two or more discrete, genetically-based phenotypes in a population, are ideal for studying the microevolutionary forces that maintain genetic variation in nature. Many anuran species exhibit striking colour or dorsal pattern polymorphisms, and so provide an excellent system in which to study questions pertaining to the evolution and maintenance of polymorphisms. Despite the wide occurrence of pattern or colour polymorphisms in anurans (current records cite at least 225 species representing 35 genera and 11 families) surprisingly little conclusive work has been done on the inheritance and selective maintenance of this variation. The mode of inheritance has been investigated in 26 species, but conclusively demonstrated in only two. Forty-six species have been described as undergoing ontogenetic change, and 32 species have been described as sexually dimorphic. That anuran polymorphisms are under some sort of selection has been inferred from the large number of polymorphic species, from putative cases of apparent convergent evolution and the existence of identical polymorphisms in closely related species, from cyclical fluctuations in morph frequencies, and from a few observations of non-random survival during bouts of stress. The selective mechanisms maintaining these polymorphisms have been investigated in only 19 species. Most studies looked for physiological traits correlated with the polymorphism, rather than studying the most obvious mechanism, selective predation on colour/pattern itself. Thus, anuran polymorphisms remain a rich but largely unexploited system for studying the evolution of phenotypic variation in nature. There are at least 225 species representing 35 genera and 11 families of anurans that exhibit a colour or pattern polymorphism. These include several apparent cases of parallel polymorphism or convergent evolution. This diversity provides an excellent system in which to study polymorphism. The mode of inheritance has been investigated in 26 species. Although most studies indicate that CP is highly heritable, simple Mendelian inheritance has been conclusively demonstrated for CP polymorphisms in only two species (not counting albinos and other variants that are too rare to qualify as polymorphisms). There is an obvious need for more genetic studies. Forty-six species have been described as undergoing ontogenetic change, and 32 have been described as sexually dimorphic. An interesting area of research would be on the adaptive benefits of ontogenetic change, and on why anurans are sexually dimorphic. That anuran CP polymorphisms are under some sort of selection has been inferred by the large number of polymorphic species, the occurrence of apparent convergent evolution and the existence of identical polymorphisms in closely related species, the observation of consistent cyclical fluctuation in frequencies of morphs over short (seasonal) or long (annual) periods of time, and a few fortuitous cases of non-random survival (A. crepitans, and R. pipiens). The mechanisms behind the selective maintenance of colour and/or pattern polymorphism have been investigated in 19 species. Most of these studies attempted to determine if some fitness-related trait was correlated with morph type, and were mostly inconclusive. Although only four studies investigated direct selection by predators on CP polymorphism itself, two of these demonstrated differential selection (albeit in the laboratory). We believe that the simplest explanation for the maintenance of CP polymorphisms is indeed direct selection by visually-oriented predators. Well-designed studies are needed on the effects of predation on morph frequencies in the field. Although such studies are difficult to conduct, they are likely to be much more fruitful than yet more searching for correlated physiological traits. This remains a wide open and potentially rewarding area of study.",https://doi.org/10.1006/bijl.1999.0421,0
182,Polyploid polymorphism in <i>Andropogon gerardii</i>,"The relationship between nuclear DNA content and chromosome number was investigated in Andropogon gerardii. The distribution of cytotypes in a natural population of this grass was also examined. Nuclear DNA content was determined using flow cytometry rather than the traditional method of Feulgen microphotometry. Our results demonstrate the increased accuracy and speed of this new method in the detection and study of polyploidy. Nuclear DNA content is strongly correlated to chromosome number in Andropogon gerardii (r = 0.971, P &lt;0.01). The natural population of this grass was found to consist of plants with 2N = 60 chromosomes (hexaploid cytotype) and 2N = 80 chromosomes (octoploid cytotype), in equal proportions. Intermediate cytotypes were lacking in the natural population, although three progeny plants grown in the greenhouse from wild-collected seed show intermediate values of nuclear DNA content and have 2N = 70 chromosomes. The two coexisting cytotypes are intermingled and show no difference in microhabitats. The absence of septaploids in the natural population suggests that the two cytotypes are probably reproductively isolated.

183,Fire Ant Polymorphism (Hymenoptera: Formicidae): Factors Affecting Worker Size,"Worker size distributions are apparently not homeostatically regulated in colonies of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta Buren. Pupae produced in artificially composed polymorphic, dimorphic, and small-worker colonies were not significantly different in either average size or frequency distributions. However, larger colonies produced significantly larger pupae. Average pupal size was tightly correlated with the logarithm of colony size all the way from single founding queens up to mature colonies with tens of thousands of workers. High larval density also resulted in significantly smaller pupae. The apparent lack of homeostatic control combined with the influences of colony size and larval density, suggest that fire ant caste distributions do not track short-term environmental contingencies. Nevertheless, the general relationship between worker size and colony size is almost certainly adaptive.",https://doi.org/10.1093/aesa/78.3.381,0
184,Reciprocal virulence and resistance polymorphism in the relationship between Toxoplasma gondii and the house mouse,"Virulence in the ubiquitous intracellular protozoon Toxoplasma gondii for its natural intermediate host, the mouse, appears paradoxical from an evolutionary standpoint because death of the mouse before encystment interrupts the parasite life cycle. Virulent T. gondii strains secrete kinases and pseudokinases that inactivate the immunity-related GTPases (IRG proteins) responsible for mouse resistance to avirulent strains. Such considerations stimulated a search for IRG alleles unknown in laboratory mice that might confer resistance to virulent strains of T. gondii. We report that the mouse IRG system shows extraordinary polymorphic complexity in the wild. We describe an IRG haplotype from a wild-derived mouse strain that confers resistance against virulent parasites by interference with the virulent kinase complex. In such hosts virulent strains can encyst, hinting at an explanation for the evolution of virulence polymorphism in T. gondii.",https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.01298,0
185,Avipoxvirus phylogenetics: identification of a PCR length polymorphism that discriminates between the two major clades,"Avipoxvirus infections have been observed in an extensive range of wild, captive and domesticated avian hosts, yet little is known about the genome diversity and host-range specificity of the causative agent(s). Genome-sequence data are largely restricted to Fowlpox virus (FWPV) and Canarypox virus (CNPV), which have been sequenced completely, showing considerable divergence between them. It is therefore proving difficult, by empirical approaches, to identify pan-genus, avipoxvirus-specific oligonucleotide probes for PCR and sequencing to support phylogenetic studies. A previous preliminary study used the fpv167 locus, which encodes orthologues of vaccinia virus core protein P4b (A3). PCR per se did not discriminate between viruses, but restriction-enzyme or sequence analysis indicated that the avipoxviruses clustered either with FWPV or with CNPV. Here, further study of the P4b locus demonstrated a third cluster, from psittacine birds. A newly identified locus, flanking fpv140 (orthologue of vaccinia virus H3L), confirms the taxonomic structure. This locus is particularly useful in that viruses from the fowlpox-like and canarypox-like clusters can be discriminated by PCR on the basis of fragment size, whilst sequence comparison allows discrimination for the first time between Pigeonpox virus and Turkeypox virus. Except within the psittacines, virus and avian host taxonomies do not show tight correlation, with viruses from the same species located in very different clades. Nor are all the existing recognized avipoxvirus species, defined primarily by avian host species (such as CNPV and Sparrowpox virus), resolved within the present structure.",https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.81738-0,0
186,"Untangling the roles of microclimate, behaviour and physiological polymorphism in governing vulnerability of intertidal snails to heat stress","Biogeographic distributions are driven by cumulative effects of smaller scale processes. Thus, vulnerability of animals to thermal stress is the result of physiological sensitivities to body temperature ( T b ), microclimatic conditions, and behavioural thermoregulation. To understand interactions among these variables, we analysed the thermal tolerances of three species of intertidal snails from different latitudes along the Chinese coast, and estimated potential T b in different microhabitats at each site. We then empirically determined the temperatures at which heart rate decreased sharply with rising temperature (Arrhenius breakpoint temperature, ABT) and at which it fell to zero (flat line temperature, FLT) to calculate thermal safety margins (TSM). Regular exceedance of FLT in sun-exposed microhabitats, a lethal effect, was predicted for only one mid-latitude site. However, ABTs of some individuals were exceeded at sun-exposed microhabitats in most sites, suggesting physiological impairment for snails with poor behavioural thermoregulation and revealing inter-individual variations (physiological polymorphism) of thermal limits. An autocorrelation analysis of T b showed that predictability of extreme temperatures was lowest at the hottest sites, indicating that the effectiveness of behavioural thermoregulation is potentially lowest at these sites. These results illustrate the critical roles of mechanistic studies at small spatial scales when predicting effects of climate change.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2016.2367,0
187,Introgression drives repeated evolution of winter coat color polymorphism in hares,"Changing from summer-brown to winter-white pelage or plumage is a crucial adaptation to seasonal snow in more than 20 mammal and bird species. Many of these species maintain nonwhite winter morphs, locally adapted to less snowy conditions, which may have evolved independently. Mountain hares ( Lepus timidus ) from Fennoscandia were introduced into the Faroe Islands in 1855. While they were initially winter-white, within ∼65 y all Faroese hares became winter-gray, a morph that occurs in the source population at low frequency. The documented population history makes this a valuable model for understanding the genetic basis and evolution of the seasonal trait polymorphism. Through whole-genome scans of differentiation and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, we associated winter coat color polymorphism to the genomic region of the pigmentation gene Agouti , previously linked to introgression-driven winter coat color variation in the snowshoe hare ( Lepus americanus ). Lower Agouti expression in the skin of winter-gray individuals during the autumn molt suggests that regulatory changes may underlie the color polymorphism. Variation in the associated genomic region shows signatures of a selective sweep in the Faroese population, suggesting that positive selection drove the fixation of the variant after the introduction. Whole-genome analyses of several hare species revealed that the winter-gray variant originated through introgression from a noncolor changing species, in keeping with the history of ancient hybridization between the species. Our findings show the recurrent role of introgression in generating winter coat color variation by repeatedly recruiting the regulatory region of Agouti to modulate seasonal coat color change.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1910471116,0
188,Haemoglobin polymorphisms affect the oxygen-binding properties in Atlantic cod populations,"A major challenge in evolutionary biology is to identify the genes underlying adaptation. The oxygen-transporting haemoglobins directly link external conditions with metabolic needs and therefore represent a unique system for studying environmental effects on molecular evolution. We have discovered two haemoglobin polymorphisms in Atlantic cod populations inhabiting varying temperature and oxygen regimes in the North Atlantic. Three-dimensional modelling of the tetrameric haemoglobin structure demonstrated that the two amino acid replacements Met55beta1Val and Lys62beta1Ala are located at crucial positions of the alpha1beta1 subunit interface and haem pocket, respectively. The replacements are proposed to affect the oxygen-binding properties by modifying the haemoglobin quaternary structure and electrostatic feature. Intriguingly, the same molecular mechanism for facilitating oxygen binding is found in avian species adapted to high altitudes, illustrating convergent evolution in water- and air-breathing vertebrates to reduction in environmental oxygen availability. Cod populations inhabiting the cold Arctic waters and the low-oxygen Baltic Sea seem well adapted to these conditions by possessing the high oxygen affinity Val55-Ala62 haplotype, while the temperature-insensitive Met55-Lys62 haplotype predominates in the southern populations. The distinct distributions of the functionally different haemoglobin variants indicate that the present biogeography of this ecologically and economically important species might be seriously affected by global warming.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2008.1529,0
189,A unique pharmacogenetic expression of the N-acetylation polymorphism in the inbred hamster.,"Liver N-acetyltransferase (NAT) preparations (105,000 x g cytosol) were obtained from both sexes of 26 strains of inbred hamsters. Liver NAT activity levels were determined for six arylamine substrates; isoniazid, p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS), sulfamethazine (SMZ), procainamide and 2-aminofluorene. The N-acetylation of isoniazid, SMZ, procainamide and 2-aminofluorene exhibited a monomorphic expression in the hamster as the genetic variation in NAT activity levels between hamster strains was only about 2-fold for each substrate. In contrast, the N-acetylation of PABA and PAS showed a polymorphic expression in the hamster. Two inbred hamster lines (Bio 1.5 and Bio 82.73) had over 400-fold lower PABA NAT and over 20-fold lower PAS NAT activity levels than did the other inbred strains. In addition, the genetically determined N-acetylation differences between the rapid and slow acetylator hamster strains were also demonstrated in vivo for PABA but not for SMZ. Comparison of Michaelis-Menten kinetic constants of PABA NAT activity in a rapid and slow acetylator strain showed a 20-fold lower Km in the rapid acetylator strain suggesting an intrinsic structural difference in rapid and slow acetylator hamster liver NAT. Thus, the pharmacogenetic expression of the N-acetylation polymorphism is quite unique in the inbred hamster, in that PABA and PAS are genetically polymorphic substrates, whereas isoniazid, SMZ, procainamide and 2-aminofluorene are monomorphic, in direct contrast to man and rabbit.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0022-3565(25)32889-2,0
190,Association of fibrillin 1 single-nucleotide polymorphism haplotypes with systemic sclerosis in Choctaw and Japanese populations,"Previously, we demonstrated with the use of microsatellite markers that a 2-cM haplotype on chromosome 15q containing the fibrillin 1 gene (FBN1) was strongly associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc) in the Choctaw, a population with high SSc prevalence. In this study, all 69 known FBN1 exons were sequenced to ascertain the presence of changes that might show associations with SSc in the Choctaw and Japanese SSc patients and controls.Screening of FBN1 exons was accomplished by polymerase chain reaction-based fluorescence sequencing of genomic DNA using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) haplotypes, and their frequencies were determined with a new algorithm that recognizes past recombination events between sites. Haplotype phylogenies were inferred using the median-joining network analysis.Five SNPs were identified in FBN1. They are located in the 5'-untranslated region (SNP-1), exon 15 (SNP-2), intron 17 (SNP-3), exon 27 (SNP-4), and intron 27 (SNP-5). Only SNP-1 (T-->C) demonstrated an association with SSc in the Choctaw. Eleven FBN1 SNP haplotypes were ascertained in the Choctaw population, 2 of which (SNPs 5 and 6) were found only in the SSc patients. These same FBN1 SNP haplotypes were associated with SSc in the Japanese.A SNP in the 5'-untranslated region of FBN1 (SNP-1, C allele) was strongly associated with SSc in the Choctaw. Furthermore, this polymorphism is present on 2 unique FBN1 haplotypes found only in Choctaw SSc patients. The same 2 haplotypes demonstrate associations with SSc in the Japanese. These data extend the earlier microsatellite studies and are consistent with the hypothesis that FBN1 or a nearby gene on chromosome 15q is involved in SSc susceptibility in the Choctaw and the Japanese.",https://doi.org/10.1002/1529-0131(200104)44:4<893::aid-anr146>3.0.co;2-3,0
191,Cuckoos Combat Socially Transmitted Defenses of Reed Warbler Hosts with a Plumage Polymorphism,"In predator-prey and host-parasite interactions, an individual's ability to combat an opponent often improves with experience--for example, by learning to identify enemy signals. Although learning occurs through individual experience, individuals can also assess threats from social information. Such recognition could promote the evolution of polymorphisms if socially transmitted defenses depend on enemy morph frequency. This would allow rare variants to evade detection. Female brood parasitic common cuckoos, Cuculus canorus, are either gray or rufous. The gray morph is a Batesian mimic whose hawk-like appearance deters host attack. Hosts reject this disguise through social learning, increasing their own defenses when they witness neighbors mobbing a cuckoo. Our experiments reveal that social learning is specific to the cuckoo morph that neighbors mob. Therefore, while neighbors alert hosts to local cuckoo activity, frequency-dependent social information selects for a cuckoo plumage polymorphism to thwart host detection. Our results suggest that selection for mimicry and polymorphisms comes not only from personal experience but also from social learning.",https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1220759,0
192,Role of a polymorphism in a Hox/Pax-responsive enhancer in the evolution of the vertebrate spine,"Patterning of the vertebrate skeleton requires the coordinated activity of Hox genes. In particular, Hox10 proteins are essential to set the transition from thoracic to lumbar vertebrae because of their rib-repressing activity. In snakes, however, the thoracic region extends well into Hox10-expressing areas of the embryo, suggesting that these proteins are unable to block rib formation. Here, we show that this is not a result of the loss of rib-repressing properties by the snake proteins, but rather to a single base pair change in a Hox/Paired box (Pax)-responsive enhancer, which prevents the binding of Hox proteins. This polymorphism is also found in Paenungulata, such as elephants and manatees, which have extended rib cages. In vivo, this modified enhancer failed to respond to Hox10 activity, supporting its role in the extension of rib cages. In contrast, the enhancer could still interact with Hoxb6 and Pax3 to promote rib formation. These results suggest that a polymorphism in the Hox/Pax-responsive enhancer may have played a role in the evolution of the vertebrate spine by differently modulating its response to rib-suppressing and rib-promoting Hox proteins.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1300592110,0

194,Leaf colour polymorphisms: a balance between plant defence and photosynthesis,"Summary Whether plants use leaf colour to deter herbivores remains controversial. The warning signal hypothesis predicts that red pigmentation is adaptive by reducing herbivory; plants with predominantly red foliage should have higher fitness than those with green leaves. Despite many discussions, this prediction has rarely been tested, and alternative, non‐exclusive hypotheses cannot be ruled out. We have exploited leaf colour polymorphism in P seudowintera colorata to test the warning signal hypothesis and to address possible alternative explanations. Consistent with warning signals, redder foliage contained higher concentrations of polygodial, a sesquiterpene dialdehyde with strong antifeedant properties, and incurred less herbivory than green leaves. Redder plants hosted 22% fewer lepidopteran leafroller larvae than neighbouring green plants. However, contrary to the predictions of the hypothesis, there were no differences in fitness parameters between red and green plants. Overall leaf canopy colour was not a significant predictor of the number of seeds per fruit or of mean seed weight. This may be explained by differences in photosynthesis: green P. colorata leaves had 47% higher maximum CO 2 assimilation rates than matched red leaves from neighbouring plants. These results indicate that the benefits of deterring insect herbivores by signalling may be balanced by the higher photosynthetic rate of non‐signalling plants. A balance between signalling and photosynthesis is a novel mechanism for the maintenance of leaf colour polymorphisms in nature. Synthesis . Anthocyanin pigments may simultaneously serve multiple functions within leaves, and individuals of the same plant species may use different strategies to cope with insect herbivores. Therefore, investigations into the role of these pigments in plant–insect interactions need to consider plant physiology and the diversity of plant defence mechanisms.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12494,0
195,Genetic Polymorphism and Molecular Epidemiology of<i>Leishmania</i>(<i>Viannia</i>)<i>braziliensis</i>from Different Hosts and Geographic Areas in Brazil,"ABSTRACT Numerical zymotaxonomy and variability of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) between the small and large subunits of the rRNA genes were used to examine strain variation and relationships in natural populations of Leishmania ( Viannia ) braziliensis . A total of 101 strains from distinct hosts and Brazilian geographic regions were assigned to 15 zymodemes clustered in two major genetic groups. The great number of isolates (48.5%) placed in zymodeme IOC/Z-27 were collected on the Atlantic coast. The high molecular diversity found in populations in the Amazon Basin was related to the great number of sandfly vector(s) in that region. The results of the restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the ITS depicted considerable intraspecific variation. Genotypic groups A, B, and C contained 39, 40, and 22 isolates, which were divided into 16, 10, and 15 genotypes, respectively. The genetic polymorphism observed demonstrates the degree of diversity of L. ( V. ) braziliensis strains from different regions where they are endemic. The results reinforce the clonal theory for Leishmania parasites showing the genetic diversity of this pathogen and an association of L. ( V. ) braziliensis genotypes with specific transmission cycles, probably reflecting an adaptation of different clones to the vector species involved.",https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.41.7.3126-3132.2003,0
196,Gender polymorphism in flowers of Silene vulgaris (Moench) Garcke (Caryophyllaceae),"Silene vulgaris occurs in Israel as a stolonifcrous tetraploid which forms mostly sexually polymorphic populations. Fully hermaphrodite and fully male-sterile plants are linked by a range of intermediate forms which are gynomonoecious and bear hermaphrodite, male-sterile, and partially male-sterile flowers. Male-sterile flowers differ from hermaphrodite ones by having a narrower calyx, a shorter corolla, a thicker style, and a considerably larger stigmatic area with longer papillae which are more markedly bulbous basally. In individual anthers of hermaphrodite flowers, diameters of stained pollen grains showed a continuous variation from 36 to 80 μm with a modal value of 56. About 30% of pollen was found to be non-stainable. Reduction in male fertility occurs at different levels, from small or inviable pollen grains through abortion of single anthers, abortion of entire androecia, and through different degrees of gynomonoecy to totally male-sterile individuals. The proportion of stainable pollen to ovules in hermaphrodite flowers alone was found to be less than 100. From the data presented, less than a third of all ovules produced in the different kinds of flower develop into seeds. This may reflect an inadequacy of pollen, which the local population of S. vulgaris can tolerate because of its stoloniferous habit.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.1984.tb01004.x,0
197,Why are dwarf fish so small? An energetic analysis of polymorphism in lake whitefish (<i>Coregonus clupeaformis</i>),"Sympatric populations of dwarf lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) (DLW) and normal lake whitefish (NLW) commonly occur in north temperate and subarctic lakes. DLW have a much lower growth, mature earlier, and have a shorter life span than NLW. Furthermore, they are usually not found when cisco (Coregonus artedi) are present, possibly due to competitive exclusion. In this study, we compared the energy budget of DLW, NLW, and cisco using food consumption rates estimated with mass balance models of chemical tracers (i.e., mercury and radiocesium). These chemicals are globally distributed and can be readily detected in fish and their prey. Our analysis showed that the energy budget of DLW and cisco was similar. DLW and cisco consumed on average 4050% more food than NLW. The conversion efficiency of DLW and cisco was two to three times lower than that of NLW. These results suggest that DLW and cisco allocated a larger fraction of their energy budget to metabolism than NLW. Our analysis also suggests that the earlier maturation and shorter life span of DLW and cisco may be due to their higher metabolic rates.",https://doi.org/10.1139/f00-252,0
198,Trophic polymorphism in a terrestrial salamander,"Question: Does habitat heterogeneity promote trophic polymorphism in a terrestrial salamander? Hypothesis: Eastern red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) in upland and lowland habitats differ morphologically because their prey’s size differs between those habitats. Field site: Five mature hardwood forests in central New York and northern Pennsylvania, USA, with known differences in diet between upland and lowland habitats. Methods: We collected animals and examined their stomach contents and their cranial morphology, the latter with digital stereomicroscope images and morphometric methods. Results: We found morphological differences between upland and lowland salamanders, although there was a considerable phenotypic range for both habitats. Lowland salamanders generally had relatively shorter heads and a lower jaw/head ratio, and upland salamanders generally had the converse. Within and among habitats, cranial morphology was associated with diet, where salamanders with lowland-like morphology consumed more large prey and fewer small prey, and salamanders with upland-like morphology consumed the converse. Conclusions: The observed trophic polymorphism and association with food use within populations suggests that this variation may accentuate variation at larger scales, and may play an important role in diversification within the genus.",,0
199,Trans-Species Polymorphism in Immune Genes: General Pattern or MHC-Restricted Phenomenon?,"Immunity exhibits extraordinarily high levels of variation. Evolution of the immune system in response to host-pathogen interactions in particular ecological contexts appears to be frequently associated with diversifying selection increasing the genetic variability. Many studies have documented that immunologically relevant polymorphism observed today may be tens of millions years old and may predate the emergence of present species. This pattern can be explained by the concept of trans-species polymorphism (TSP) predicting the maintenance and sharing of favourable functionally important alleles of immune-related genes between species due to ongoing balancing selection. Despite the generality of this concept explaining the long-lasting adaptive variation inherited from ancestors, current research in TSP has vastly focused only on major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In this review we summarise the evidence available on TSP in human and animal immune genes to reveal that TSP is not a MHC-specific evolutionary pattern. Further research should clearly pay more attention to the investigation of TSP in innate immune genes and especially pattern recognition receptors which are promising candidates for this type of evolution. More effort should also be made to distinguish TSP from convergent evolution and adaptive introgression. Identification of balanced TSP variants may represent an accurate approach in evolutionary medicine to recognise disease-resistance alleles.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2015/838035,0
200,Gut bacteria alteration in obese people and its relationship with gene polymorphism,"To investigate the differences in cultivable gut bacteria and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 (PPAR-γ2) gene Pro12Ala variation in obese and normal-weight Chinese people.Using culture methods, the amounts of Escherichia coli, Enterococci, Bacteroides, Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria and Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) in the feces of 52 obese participants [body mass index (BMI): ≥ 28 kg/m(2)] and 52 participants of normal-weight (BMI: 18.5-24 kg/m(2)) were obtained. Study participants completed comprehensive questionnaires and underwent clinical laboratory tests. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-PFLP) assay was used to analyze PPAR-γ2 gene Pro12Ala variation.The obese group exhibited a lower amount of C. perfringens (6.54 ± 0.65 vs 6.94 ± 0.57, P = 0.001) and Bacteroides (9.81 ± 0.58 vs 10.06 ± 0.39, P = 0.012) than their normal-weight counterparts. No major differences were observed in Pro12Ala genotype distribution between the two groups; however, obese individuals with a Pro/Ala genotype had a significantly lower level of Bacteroides (9.45 ± 0.62 vs 9.93 ± 0.51, P = 0.027) than those with a Pro/Pro genotype. In addition, the obese group demonstrated a higher stool frequency (U = 975, P < 0.001) and a looser stool (U = 1062, P = 0.015) than the normal-weight group.Our results indicated interactions among cultivable gut flora, host genetic factors and obese phenotype and this might be helpful for obesity prevention.",https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v17.i8.1076,0
201,Multiple origins of polyploids in the Glycine tabacina complex inferred from chloroplast DNA polymorphism.,"The Glycine tabacina polyploid complex has been shown to include a minimum of two morphological and crossing groups, which also differ in chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) restriction map and nuclear ribosomal gene repeat phenotype. These AAB2B2 and BBB2B2 G. tabacina polyploids contain plastomes referable to the A and B diploid plastome groups of subgenus Glycine, respectively. Eight different cpDNA variants were observed among the 65 B-type polyploids studied, six of which were identical for numerous restriction site characters to plastome types found among the highly polymorphic B genome diploid species. It is hypothesized that there have been numerous independent origins of polyploid G. tabacina: at least one AA x B2B2 event and a minimum of five BB x B2B2 events involving different BB types as female progenitor. Low amounts of cpDNA divergence between diploid and polyploid plastomes and among the plastomes of geographically disjunct polyploids suggest that the origin and dispersal of polyploids are relatively recent events. All hypothesized diploid progenitors are native to Australia, while both A- and B-type G. tabacina polyploids occur on islands of the Pacific outside the range of diploids. The presence of several different plastome types of polyploid G. tabacina in the Pacific islands suggests that several colonization events have occurred.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.87.2.714,0
202,EVOLUTIONARY PACE OF CHROMOSOMAL POLYMORPHISM IN COLONIZING POPULATIONS OF DROSOPHILA SUBOBSCURA: AN EVOLUTIONARY TIME SERIES,"Biologists have long debated the speed, uniformity, and predictability of evolutionary change. However, evaluating such patterns on a geographic scale requires time‐series data on replicate sets of natural populations. Drosophila subobscura has proven an ideal model system for such studies. This fly is broadly distributed in the Old World, but was introduced into both North and South America just over two decades ago and then spread rapidly. Rapid, uniform, and predictable evolution would be demonstrated if the invading flies evolved latitudinal clines that progressively converged on those of the native populations. Evolutionary geneticists quickly capitalized on this opportunity to monitor evolutionary dynamics. Just a few years after the introduction, they surveyed chromosomal inversion frequencies in both North and South America. On both continents they detected incipient latitudinal clines in chromosome inversion frequencies that almost always had the same sign with latitude as in the Old World. Thus the initial evolution of chromosomal polymorphisms on a continental scale was remarkably rapid and consistent. Here we report newer samples of inversion frequencies for the colonizing populations: the time series now spans almost one decade for North America and almost two decades for South America. Almost all inversions in the New World continue to show the same sign of frequency with latitude as in the Old World. Nevertheless, inversion clines have not consistently increased in steepness over time; nor have they consistently continued to converge on the Old World baseline. However, five arrangements in South America show directional, continentwide shifts in frequency. Overall, the initial consistency of clinal evolutionary trajectories seen in the first surveys seems not to have been maintained.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00591.x,0
203,Abiotic factors may explain the geographical distribution of flower colour morphs and the maintenance of colour polymorphism in the scarlet pimpernel,"Summary Flower colour polymorphism is traditionally attributed to pollinator selection although other factors, such as indirect selection on correlated traits, can play an important role. L ysimachia arvensis is a widespread annual species with two colour morphs differing in anthocyanin composition. We explored the hypothesis that colour polymorphism is maintained by selection related to environmental heterogeneity. M orph frequencies and environmental traits were recorded in 51 populations along a wide geographical range. To explore the existence of morph‐by‐environment interactions, we conducted an experimental study comparing the two morphs under treatments differing in water and light availability. A geographical pattern was found with a negative association between blue frequencies and latitude. The proportion of the blue morph increased with temperature and sunshine hours, but decreased with precipitation. Flowering onset and flower size differed between morphs and scarcely varied across treatments. In contrast, several fitness components such as germination, seedling survival, seedling mass and flower production showed important morph‐by‐environment interactions. The blue morph showed higher overall male and female fitness in all the treatment combinations excepting in sun‐wet conditions where the red morph had higher fitness. Synthesis . Our results indicate that the mechanism of selection on flower colour seems to be related to differences in fitness of both morphs due to abiotic factors. These differences could explain the geographical distribution of flower colour morphs and the maintenance of the colour polymorphism. The marked difference in flowering time between morphs leaves open the potential for assortative mating and speciation in L ysimachia arvensis .",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12151,0
204,"Thrombophilia, Hypofibrinolysis, the eNOS T-786C Polymorphism, and Multifocal Osteonecrosis","We examined the hypothesis that thrombophilia, hypofibrinolysis, and the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) T-786C polymorphism are common, potentially treatable, and similar pathophysiologic causes of multifocal (three sites or more) and unifocal (single-site) osteonecrosis.We prospectively evaluated twenty-six consecutively referred adults with multifocal osteonecrosis, who included thirteen with idiopathic multifocal osteonecrosis and thirteen with secondary multifocal osteonecrosis (resulting from steroid therapy in ten and alcoholism in three). We compared these patients with race, sex, and age-matched normal control subjects and with patients with idiopathic unifocal and secondary unifocal osteonecrosis, respectively. Using polymerase chain reaction and serologic measures, we studied thrombophilic and hypofibrinolytic mutations and the eNOS T-786C polymorphism.The total number of polymerase chain reaction and serologic thrombophilic-hypofibrinolytic abnormalities and the eNOS T-786C polymorphism did not differ between patients with idiopathic (p > 0.5) or secondary (p > 0.5) multifocal and unifocal osteonecrosis. The frequency of low free protein-S levels (<66%) in patients with secondary multifocal osteonecrosis (four of eleven patients) was higher than that in the control subjects (one of fifty-nine) (risk ratio = 21.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.6 to 174; p = 0.0016, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p [Bp] = 0.004). Factor-V Leiden heterozygosity was present in two of thirteen patients with secondary multifocal osteonecrosis compared with none of sixty-four control subjects (p = 0.027, Bp = 0.008). For eleven patients with secondary multifocal osteonecrosis, the eNOS T-786C polymorphism was present in nine of twenty-two alleles compared with eight of forty-four alleles in twenty-two normal control subjects (risk ratio = 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 5.0; p = 0.047, Bp = 0.016). The frequency of homocystinemia (>13.5 mumol/L) was higher in patients with idiopathic multifocal osteonecrosis (two of thirteen patients) than in normal controls (none of fifty-one) (p = 0.039, Bp = 0.004). A high level of factor VIII (>150%) was seen in four of eight patients with idiopathic multifocal osteonecrosis and in seven of forty-eight normal controls (risk ratio = 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 9.1; p = 0.04, Bp = 0.008). The eNOS T-786C mutant allele was present in seven of twelve alleles in the six patients with idiopathic multifocal osteonecrosis who were tested, compared with twenty-five of 108 alleles in fifty-four control subjects (risk ratio = 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 4.5; p = 0.015, Bp = 0.008).Limited by the small numbers of patients with multifocal osteonecrosis, this exploratory study suggested that thrombophilia was associated with both idiopathic multifocal osteonecrosis and secondary multifocal osteonecrosis, as was the eNOS T-786C polymorphism. Multifocal and unifocal osteonecrosis are similarly associated with thrombophilia, hypofibrinolysis, and the eNOS T-786C polymorphism, which are potentially treatable pathophysiologic conditions, requiring further study.",https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.g.00616,0
205,Evolution of a unique <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> chloroquine-resistance phenotype in association with <i>pfcrt</i> polymorphism in Papua New Guinea and South America,"The mechanistic basis for chloroquine resistance (CQR) in Plasmodium falciparum recently has been linked to the polymorphic gene pfcrt . Alleles associated with CQR in natural parasite isolates harbor threonine (T), as opposed to lysine (K) at amino acid 76. P. falciparum CQR strains of African and Southeast Asian origin carry pfcrt alleles encoding an amino acid haplotype of CVIET (residues 72–76), whereas most South American CQR strains studied carry an allele encoding an SVMNT haplotype; chloroquine-sensitive strains from malarious regions around the world carry a CVMNK haplotype. Upon investigating the origin of pfcrt alleles in Papua New Guinean (PNG) P. falciparum we found either the chloroquine-sensitive-associated CVMNK or CQR-associated SVMNT haplotypes previously seen in Brazilian isolates. Remarkably we did not find the CVIET haplotype observed in CQR strains from Southeast Asian regions more proximal to PNG. Further we found a previously undescribed CQR phenotype to be associated with the SVMNT haplotype from PNG and South America. This CQR phenotype is significantly less responsive to verapamil chemosensitization compared with the effect associated with the CVIET haplotype. Consistent with this, we observed that verapamil treatment of P. falciparum isolates carrying pfcrt SVMNT is associated with an attenuated increase in digestive vacuole pH relative to CVIET pfcrt -carrying isolates. These data suggest a key role for pH-dependent changes in hematin receptor concentration in the P. falciparum CQR mechanism. Our findings also suggest that P. falciparum CQR has arisen through multiple evolutionary pathways associated with pfcrt K76T.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.221440898,0
206,Coagulase and protein A polymorphisms do not contribute to persistence of nasal colonisation by Staphylococcus aureus,"The nasal carriage rate of Staphylococcus aureus was examined in a longitudinal study of 31 healthy Danish volunteers. Each person was classified as persistent (>8 positive cultures from 10 examinations), an intermittent carrier (50–80% positive cultures) or an ocassional carrier (positive cultures on 10–40% of ocassions only). One hundred and twenty strains from these persons were subjected to phage typing and random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. Phage and RAPD typing were in close agreement. RAPD confirmed the spread of a particular S. aureus clone (phage type 95) throughout Denmark. However, no common genotype or phenotype characteristics of S. aureus that could separate persistent from intermittent or incidental colonisers were identified. The immunoglobulin binding protein A and the prothrombin binding coagulase protein are both putative S. aureus virulence or defence factors. Analysis of polymorphisms in the variable repeat regions in the genes for these proteins showed no correlation between the number of repeat units and, consequently, the protein structure with the ability of strains to persist in the human nasal mucosa. The amount of protein A, detectable by its IgG binding activity, appeared not to be correlated to persistence of carriage. Thus protein A and coagulase -gene polymorphisms do not seem to play a significant role in the propensity of S. aureus to colonise human nasal epithelium. Furthermore, based on the genetic heterogeneity encountered among the S. aureus strains it is suggested that within the current study population, no single clonal lineage of S. aureus has increased capability to colonise the human nasal epithelium.",https://doi.org/10.1099/00222615-46-3-222,0
207,COL6A1 Polymorphisms Associated With Ossification of the Ligamentum Flavum and Ossification of the Posterior Longitudinal Ligament,"In Brief Study Design. A case–control association study was conducted to investigate the genetic etiology for ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine (OPLL). Objective. To determine whether COL6A1 polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to OLF and OPLL in Chinese Han population. Summary of Background Data. The COL6A1 has been identified as a susceptibility gene for OPLL in Japanese. The susceptibility gene for OPLL may be different among various populations, so we investigated whether COL6A1 polymorphisms are also associated with OPLL in Chinese Han population. OLF and OPLL are similar in epidemiology, etiology, and pathology, and common coexist. Hereditary factors may be implicated in OLF and COL6A1 may be a potential susceptibility gene for OLF, so we investigated the relations between COL6A1 polymorphisms and OLF. Methods. Four known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of COL6A1 were genotyped among 338 Chinese Han subjects by high throughput GenomeLab SNPstream genotyping system. Allele frequency and genotype distribution of each polymorphism were compared using a contingency χ2 test between 183 cases (90 OPLL, 61 OLF, and 32 OPLL coexisting with OLF) and 155 controls. Results. Among 4 studied SNPs, allele frequency of promoter (−572T) SNP demonstrated the most significant difference not only between OPLL cases and controls (P = 2.65E-4), but also between OLF cases and controls (P =7.38E-4). Moreover, the overall frequency of haplotypes constructed from promoter (−572), intron 32 (−29), and intron 33 (+20) SNPs showed significant difference not only between the patients with OPLL and controls, but also between the patients with OLF and controls (P = 5.86E-3, P = 1.5E-8, respectively). Conclusion. This is the first report on SNPs of COL6A1 in OLF that suggests polymorphisms may be a risk factor for OLF. Our findings indicate that COL6A1 may be a common susceptibility gene for OLF and OPLL in Chinese Han population. A case–control association study was conducted to determine whether COL6A1 polymorphisms are associated with OLF as well as OPLL. Four SNPs of COL6A1 were genotyped among 338 Chinese Han subjects by GenomeLab SNPstream genotyping system. Our findings suggest COL6A1 may be a common susceptibility gene for OLF and OPLL.",https://doi.org/10.1097/brs.0b013e31815b761c,0
208,Chromosomal polymorphism of ribosomal genes in the genus Oryza,"The genes encoding for 18S-5.8S-28S ribosomal RNA (rDNA) are both conserved and diversified. We used rDNA as probe in the fluorescent in situ hybridization (rDNA-FISH) to localized rDNAs on chromosomes of 15 accessions representing ten Oryza species. These included cultivated and wild species of rice, and four of them are tetraploids. Our results reveal polymorphism in the number of rDNA loci, in the number of rDNA repeats, and in their chromosomal positions among Oryza species. The numbers of rDNA loci varies from one to eight among Oryza species. The rDNA locus located at the end of the short arm of chromosome 9 is conserved among the genus Oryza. The rDNA locus at the end of the short arm of chromosome 10 was lost in some of the accessions. In this study, we report two genome specific rDNA loci in the genus Oryza. One is specific to the BB genome, which was localized at the end of the short arm of chromosome 4. Another may be specific to the CC genome, which was localized in the proximal region of the short arm of chromosome 5. A particular rDNA locus was detected as stretched chromatin with bright signals at the proximal region of the short arm of chromosome 4 in O. grandiglumis by rDNA-FISH. We suggest that chromosomal inversion and the amplification and transposition of rDNA might occur during Oryza species evolution. The possible mechanisms of cyto-evolution in tetraploid Oryza species are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00122-007-0705-z,0
209,Chloroplast DNA polymorphism signals complex interspecific interactions in Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae),"Variation in the chloroplast genome of 44 accessions representing 14 Eucalyptus L'Hér. species from the series Viminales (sensu Pryor and Johnson 1971) was investigated. Southern analysis of the chloroplast genomes restricted with 12 enzymes revealed 20 restriction-site polymorphisms of which 7 were autapomorphic to individual trees. The 13 informative restriction-site polymorphisms were distributed between individuals of different species, but none was species-specific. Fourteen chloroplast haplotypes were identified for south-eastern Australian individuals. In endemic Tasmanian species, five haplotypes were identified. Chloroplast haplotypes appear to have a mosaic distribution in south-eastern Australia, more closely associated with geographical regions than with morphological species boundaries. The biogeographic distribution of chloroplast haplotypes may be explained by a combination of interspecific hybridisation and introgression, and convergent evolution. The lack of species-specificity of cpDNA variation indicates that, although cpDNA is not appropriate for species-level phylogeny analysis in the series Viminales, it may provide useful information in studies of biogeography and gene flow in Eucalyptus.",https://doi.org/10.1071/sb96028,0
210,"Comparison of Two Fingerprinting Techniques, Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism and Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis, for Determination of Bacterial Diversity in Aquatic Environments","We investigated bacterial diversity in different aquatic environments (including marine and lagoon sediments, coastal seawater, and groundwater), and we compared two fingerprinting techniques (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism [T-RFLP] and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis [ARISA]) which are currently utilized for estimating richness and community composition. Bacterial diversity ranged from 27 to 99 phylotypes (on average, 56) using the T-RFLP approach and from 62 to 101 genotypes (on average, 81) when the same samples were analyzed using ARISA. The total diversity encountered in all matrices analyzed was 144 phylotypes for T-RFLP and 200 genotypes for ARISA. Although the two techniques provided similar results in the analysis of community structure, bacterial richness and diversity estimates were significantly higher using ARISA. These findings suggest that ARISA is more effective than T-RFLP in detecting the presence of bacterial taxa accounting for <5% of total amplified product. ARISA enabled also distinction among aquatic bacterial isolates of Pseudomonas spp. which were indistinguishable using T-RFLP analysis. Overall, the results of this study show that ARISA is more accurate than T-RFLP analysis on the 16S rRNA gene for estimating the biodiversity of aquatic bacterial assemblages.",https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01361-06,0

Metacercariae of the Family Heterophyidae in marine and freshwater fishes are nonfastidious in their choice of definitive hosts, and therefore, cause infections in human and domestic animals. In the present study, species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were developed for identifying and differentiating the various species examined. Sequencing and aligning the 18S (SSU) rDNA revealed interspecific variation for which species-specific DNA oligonucleotides were designed and used for the identification of 6 heterophyid species recovered from piscivorous birds. The oligonucleotides were further used to evaluate the various stages (cercariae recovered from snails, metacercariae recovered from fish and adult trematodes) of the digeneans. By applying this method we elucidated for the first time the life cycle of Pygidiopsis genata. The phylogenetic interrelationship among the newly sequenced species of Heterophyidae is outlined.

212,Coexistence of three calcium carbonate polymorphs in the shell of the Antarctic clam <i>Laternula elliptica</i>,"We analyzed shell cuts of five individuals of the Antarctic bivalve Laternula elliptica from three locations along the Antarctic Peninsula by means of Confocal Raman Microscopy (CRM) as well as Electron Microprobe (EMP). The shell of L. elliptica has been previously described as being composed of aragonite exclusively. Now, CRM mapping reveals that three polymorphs of calcium carbonate – aragonite, calcite, and vaterite – are present in the chondrophore region of the examined individuals. Annual shell growth layers continue through aragonite and vaterite, suggesting simultaneous mineralization of both polymorphs. Spatially congruent EMP scans showed that the calcium carbonate polymorph affects the distribution of magnesium and strontium within the chondrophore. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of the coexistence of these three calcium carbonate polymorphs within the mineralized structures of a marine calcifying organism. Particularly the presence of vaterite is unexpected, but shows striking similarities to some fish otoliths. The strong effect of the calcium carbonate polymorph on trace element incorporation restrict the suitability of magnesium and strontium based proxies for the chondrophore area of L. elliptica.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2011gc003996,0
213,Major <scp>H</scp>istocompatibility <scp>C</scp>omplex class <scp>II</scp>b polymorphism influences gut microbiota composition and diversity,"Abstract Animals harbour diverse communities of symbiotic bacteria, which differ dramatically among host individuals. This heterogeneity poses an immunological challenge: distinguishing between mutualistic and pathogenic members of diverse and host‐specific microbial communities. We propose that M ajor H istocompatibility class II ( MHC ) genotypes contribute to recognition and regulation of gut microbes, and thus, MHC polymorphism contributes to microbial variation among hosts. Here, we show that MHC II b polymorphism is associated with among‐individual variation in gut microbiota within a single wild vertebrate population of a small fish, the threespine stickleback. We sampled stickleback from C edar L ake, on V ancouver I sland, and used next‐generation sequencing to genotype the sticklebacks’ gut microbiota (16S sequencing) and their MHC class II b exon 2 sequences. The presence of certain MHC motifs was associated with altered relative abundance (increase or decrease) of some microbial Families. The effect sizes are modest and entail a minority of microbial taxa, but these results represent the first indication that MHC genotype may affect gut microbiota composition in natural populations ( MHC ‐microbe associations have also been found in a few studies of lab mice). Surprisingly, these MHC effects were frequently sex‐dependent. Finally, hosts with more diverse MHC motifs had less diverse gut microbiota. One implication is that MHC might influence the efficacy of therapeutic strategies to treat dysbiosis‐associated disease, including the outcome of microbial transplants between healthy and diseased patients. We also speculate that macroparasite‐driven selection on MHC has the potential to indirectly alter the host gut microbiota, and vice versa.",https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.12846,0
214,The deletion polymorphism of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme gene is associated with target organ damage in essential hypertension.,"The activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is thought to play a significant role in the development of target organ damage in essential hypertension. An insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene has recently been associated with increased risk for left ventricular hypertrophy and coronary heart disease in the general population. The D allele is associated with higher levels of circulating ACE and therefore may predispose to cardiovascular damage. The study presented here was performed to investigate the association between the ACE genotype, microalbuminuria, retinopathy, and left ventricular hypertrophy in 106 patients with essential hypertension. ACE gene polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction technique. Microalbuminuria was evaluated as albumin-to-creatinine ratio (A/C) in three nonconsecutive first morning urine samples (negative urine culture) after a 4-wk washout period. Microalbuminuria was defined as A/C between 2.38 to 19 (men) and 2.96 to 20 (women). Hypertensive retinopathy was evaluated by direct funduscopic examination (keith-Wagener-Barker classification) and left ventricular hypertrophy by M-B mode echocardiography. The distribution of the DD, ID, and II genotypes was 27, 50, and 23%, respectively. The prevalence of microalbuminuria, retinopathy, and left ventricular hypertrophy was 19, 74, and 72% respectively. There were no differences among the three genotypes for age, known duration of disease, body mass index, blood pressure, serum glucose, uric acid, and lipid profile. DD and ID genotypes were significantly associated with the presence of microalbuminuria (odds ratio, 8.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.07 to 67.85; P = 0.019), retinopathy (odds ratio, 5.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.71 to 15.75; P = 0.005) and left ventricular hypertrophy (odds ratio, 5.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.52 to 17.94; P = 0.016). Furthermore, patients with DD and ID genotypes showed higher levels of A/C (3.6 +/- 0.9, DD; 2.6 +/- 0.7, ID; 0.9 +/- 0.2 mg/mmol, II; P = 0.0015 by analysis of variance) and increased left ventricular mass index (152 +/- 4.7, DD + ID versus 133 +/- 5.7 g/m2, II; P = 0.01) compared with II patients. The D allele was significantly more frequent in patients with microalbuminuria (odds ratio, 2.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.24 to 5.41; P = 0.013) and in those with retinopathy (odds ratio, 2.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.21 to 4.90; P = 0.015). Multiple regression analyses performed among the entire cohort of patients demonstrated that ACE genotype significantly and independently influences the presence of retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, and microalbuminuria. In conclusion, the D allele of the ACE gene is associated with microalbuminuria as well as with retinopathy and left ventricular hypertrophy, and seems to be an independent risk factor for target organ damage in essential hypertension.",https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.v7122550,0
215,A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the human beta-defensin 1 gene is associated with HIV-1 infection in Italian children,"In this study we show a significant correlation between a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the 5'-untranslated region of theDEFB1gene, which probably regulates the gene expression of human beta defensin 1 (hBD-1) and the risk of HIV-1 infection in an Italian paediatric population (97 HIV-1 perinatally infected children), pointing to the importance of innate immunity in HIV-1 infection. In the past few years researchers have recognized a number of novel proteins of the innate immune system that play important roles in conferring resistance to HIV-1 infection, especially in newborns, in whom the acquired immune response is not fully developed [1]. Defensins are perhaps the most important family of antimicrobial peptides in humans, and are known for their antiviral activities [2]. Furthermore, defensins play an important role in linking innate and adaptive immunity acting as 'mini-chemokines' [3]. The β-defensins, encoded by genes localized on 8p22–23, are small cationic amphipathic peptides (30–48 amino acids). DEFB1, which encodes the human beta defensin 1 (hBD-1) gene, is constitutively expressed within the oral cavity, skin, and internal epithelia, and its expression varies between individuals [4]. This study shows a significant correlation between a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5'- untranslated region of the DEFB1 gene and the risk of HIV-1 infection in newborns in an Italian paediatric population. The study highlights the importance of innate immunity in HIV-1 infection. Ninety-seven HIV-1 perinatally infected children (mean age 6.6 years ± 52.2 months) were enrolled for the study. All of these children were born to HIV-1-positive mothers who had not undergone any antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, and had not undergone caesarean section to prevent transmission. A total of 120 uninfected children, from the same ethnic background and matched for age, were employed as controls after informed consent. These children were known to be not at risk of infection and were not infected as their mothers were HIV-1 negative and they had never been exposed to the routes of virus transmission. DNA was extracted by using the GenomicPrep kit (Amersham-Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and polymerase chain reaction amplification performed under standard conditions [5] DNA sequences were obtained using the Big Dye Terminator sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and allele frequencies were calculated by direct gene counting. The significance of differences in allelic and genotype frequencies was calculated by Fisher's exact test using 2 × 2 contingency tables. Holm's correction for multiple tests was performed and only corrected P values less than 0.05 were considered to be significant. All the statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS software (version 6.1.3; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). We studied the frequency of three SNP in the 5'-untranslated region of the DEFB1 gene, which is likely to regulate gene expression, in both HIV-1-infected children and healthy controls matched for age. The three SNP examined were: (i) −52 (G/A); (ii) −44 (C/G); and iii) −20 (G/A). Allele and genotype frequencies for the three SNP in the two cohorts studied are shown in Table 1.Table 1: Frequencies of DEFB1 polymorphisms in infected children perinatally exposed to HIV-1 and pan-ethnic healthy controls.Allele frequencies of the −44 C/G SNP was significantly different in HIV-1-positive children compared with healthy controls. Moreover, the distribution of the three genotypes was shown to be significantly different from that of healthy controls (P < 0.001; corrected P value < 0.05). This is mainly caused by the difference in the frequency of (−44)CC homozygous individuals. The odds ratio for the (−44)CC genotype in HIV-1-infected children is 3.6 (95% confidence interval 1.89–6.90). Both genotype and allele frequencies of the −20G/A SNP in HIV-1-positive children were similar to the controls. Allele frequencies of the −52 G/A SNP in HIV-1-positive children were significantly different from healthy controls; however, they did not reach the significance level of 0.05 when Holm's correction is applied (Table 1). The (−44)C allele, located in a region that is highly conserved in other primate species, has already been shown to correlate with the risk of Candida spp. carriage [5], strongly supporting a role for this polymorphism in the modulation of DEFB1 expression. Dorschner et al. [6] recently demonstrated that murine beta defensin 1 (mBD-1), the murine homologous of hBD-1, is upregulated in embryonic and neonatal skin, and provides protection against infections in the earlier stage of the life. The HIV-1-positive children under study here were infected during delivery by contact with HIV-1-infected maternal blood or mucus in the birth canal. We can hypothesize that hBD-1 is very important in protecting the skin and mucosa of newborns in this stage by interacting with the viral particles or with cells of the immune response. In this study design we cannot exclude the possibility that the −44 C/G polymorphism is associated with HIV infection of the mothers or their ability to transmit the virus to their children. Unfortunately, biological samples from the mothers of HIV-1-infected children were not available to us or information on their viral load at the time of delivery. If women with these polymorphisms are more likely to be infected with HIV than women without the polymorphisms, then children of HIV-infected women may be expected to have a higher frequency of this polymorphism than controls, even if there is not a direct effect on vertical transmission. Another possibility is that the polymorphism may be associated with more rapid disease progression, and thus higher viral loads, in women who are infected. As higher viral loads are associated with an increased rate of vertical transmission, again, we may expect to see this relationship even if there is not a direct influence of the polymorphism itself on vertical transmission. To address these points a study on an adult population and a study on transmitter against non-transmitter mothers is necessary. A very recent study [7] demonstrated that HIV-1 replication is inhibited in human epithelial cells by β-defensins 2 and 3, that both of these molecules are able to interact with viral particles and downregulate the expression of CXCR4 in host cells. However, the same study did not demonstrate a role for hBD-1 in HIV-1 infection. One hypothesis that could explain this discrepancy would be that hBD-1 acts in synergy with other antimicrobial peptides expressed in the skin and at the mucosal surface (such as hBD-2, 3 and LL-37), or it may be that a new role for this peptide has not yet been discovered. Moreover, as DEFB1 is located close to the DEFB4 and DEFB103 genes (that encode for hBD-2 and 3, respectively), this SNP could be in linkage disequilibrium with another protective allele in these genes or could be associated with the polymorphic number of these genes and then with their expression in the skin [8]. To our knowledge, this is the first study that reports a significant association between an SNP in the DEFB1 gene and HIV-1 infection in children born to seropositive mothers; our results could suggest new insights into therapies based on synthetic antimicrobial peptides, to prevent HIV-1 mother-to-child transmission.

216,"Flower colour polymorphism in the Mediterranean Basin: occurrence, maintenance and implications for speciation","Flower colour polymorphism (FCP) is the occurrence of at least two discrete flower colour variants in the same population. Despite a vast body of research concerning the maintenance and evolutionary consequences of FCP, only recently has the spatial variation in morph frequencies among populations been explored. Here we summarise the biochemical and genetic basis of FCP, the factors that have been proposed to explain their maintenance, and the importance of FCP and its geographic variation in the speciation process. We also review the incidence of FCP in the environmentally heterogeneous Mediterranean Basin. Nearly 88% of Mediterranean FCP species showed anthocyanin-based polymorphisms. Concerning the evolutionary mechanisms that contribute to maintain FCP, selection by pollinators is suggested in some species, but in others, selection by non-pollinator agents, genetic drift or gene flow are also found; in some cases different processes interact in the maintenance of FCP. We emphasise the role of both autonomous selfing and clonal reproduction in FCP maintenance. Mediterranean polymorphic species show mainly monomorphic populations with only a few polymorphic ones, which generate clinal or mosaic patterns of variation in FCP. No cases of species with only polymorphic populations were found. We posit that different evolutionary processes maintaining polymorphism the Mediterranean Basin will result in a continuum of geographic patterns in morph compositions and relative frequencies of FCP species.",https://doi.org/10.1111/plb.12575,0
217,Fruit and seed polymorphism and its relation to seedling growth in the genus <i>Cakile</i>,"To ascertain the adaptive significance of dimorphism under unpredictable environments, the dimorphic fruit segments of Cakile edentula var. lacustris, Cakile edentula var. edentula, and Cakile maritima were tested for differences in size of propagules, dispersal ability, germination behaviour, and growth rate. The upper and lower fruit segments differed in some attributes but not in others. For example, the fruits, seeds, and shells of upper segments were significantly heavier than those of lower segments. However, the frequency distributions of mean mass per seed, shell, and fruit indicated a considerable zone of overlap beneath the histograms of upper and lower fruit segments. Under still conditions in a greenhouse, no differences were found in the floating ability of upper and lower fruit segments of C. edentula var. lacustris and C. maritima. Of the three taxa, C. maritima fruits had the highest shell to seed mass ratio and floated for the longest period of time. Morphological seed dimorphism was linked with a physiological seed dimorphism. The lower fruit segments of C. edentula var. lacustris germinated better than the upper fruit segments over a wider range of temperatures. Light did not alter the final germination percentage of upper or lower fruit segments but inhibited the rate of germination. The relative growth rate decreased in all three taxa with an increase in the age of a seedling, irrespective of its seed weight.",https://doi.org/10.1139/b89-353,0
218,THE EFFECTS OF PREDATION ON ARTIFICIAL MIMETIC POLYMORPHISMS WITH PERFECT AND IMPERFECT MIMICS AT VARYING FREQUENCIES,"Three main factors probably determine the effectiveness of Batesian mimicry.They are the frequency of the mimic, the degree of distastefulness of the model and the degree of perfection of the mimic.J. Brower (1960), using colored mealworms as models with perfect mimics, demonstrated that the mimics were selectively advantageous over a range of different frequencies relative to their models.Even at a frequency as high as 80%, the perfect mimics were well protected.She also showed that when models were more distasteful, they could support a higher frequency of mimics.O'Donald and Pilecki (1970) tested the hypothesis that frequency-depedent selection would maintain a mimetic polymorphism.In their experiments, baits of flour and lard were the artificial prey and sparrows the predators.The prey consisted of two different distasteful models, palatable mimics that perfectly resembled their models, and a palatable non-mimic.If the models were only slightly distasteful, then the rarer mimic did possess a selective advantage over the more common one.But there was no frequency-dependent selection if the models were highly distasteful: both the rare and common mimics were then equally well protected by their models.This is consistent with J. Brower's findings that more distasteful models can effectively support a greater frequency of mimics.If the mimics retain their advantage at higher fre-",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1971.tb01890.x,0
219,"Modification speed alters stability of ecological higher-order
  interaction networks","Higher-order interactions (HOIs) have the potential to greatly increase our understanding of ecological interaction networks beyond what is possible with established models that usually consider only pairwise interactions between organisms. While equilibrium values of such HOI-based models have been studied, the dynamics of these models and the stability of their equilibria remain underexplored. Here we present a novel investigation on the effect of the onset speed of a higher-order interaction. In particular, we study the stability of the equilibrium of all configurations of a three-species interaction network, including transitive as well as intransitive ones. We show that the HOI onset speed has a dramatic effect on the evolution and stability of the ecological network, with significant structural changes compared to commonly used HOI extensions or pairwise networks. Changes in the HOI onset speed from fast to slow can reverse the stability of the interaction network. The evolution of the system also affects the equilibrium that will be reached, influenced by the HOI onset speed.

221,Herbivore density mediates the indirect effect of herbivores on plants via induced resistance and apparent competition,"Abstract Herbivore‐induced plant resistance and apparent competition are two indirect ways herbivores interact. If a less damaging herbivore indirectly suppresses the abundance of a more damaging herbivore via these mechanisms, then plants may ultimately benefit. Changes in herbivore density, however, can dictate the intensity of species interactions and may play a critical role in determining the outcome of plant‐ and predator‐mediated herbivore interactions. We tested the effects of herbivore density on the strength of indirect interactions among phloem‐feeding aphids and herbivorous caterpillars and the outcome of these interactions for their shared host plant, cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum ). We quantified the survival of caterpillars on host plants that were infested with varying densities of aphids in the presence and absence of predators (ladybeetles). We found that aphids induced defensive proteins in cotton plants and that caterpillar survival was negatively affected by induced resistance. Likewise, we found that the presence of aphids increased predation of caterpillars by ladybeetles, but that apparent competition between aphids and caterpillars was density dependent. Ladybeetles consumed relatively high numbers of small caterpillars at low to intermediate aphid densities, but essentially became aphid specialists at high aphid densities. Aphid induced defenses and apparent competition combined such that plant damage by caterpillars was lowest when predators were present at low aphid density (induced resistance + highest level of apparent competition). This suggests that herbivores can benefit plants, but the effect on host plants is mediated by herbivore density. Indirect herbivore‐plant mutualisms may increase plant quality, plant fitness, and yield of crop plants and these interactions need to be considered in ecologically based pest management plans. In addition, these interactions likely alter arthropod community structure and natural selection on anti‐herbivore defense traits in plants in natural systems.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1218,0
222,Direct and indirect effect of cannibalism and intraguild predation in the two sibling <i>Harmonia</i> ladybird beetles,"Abstract In this study, we focused on the direct (i.e., predation) and indirect (i.e., potential threat from coexisting with a larger individual) effects of cannibalism and intraguild predation (IGP) during larval stages of two sibling ladybird beetles. These effects play an important role in the coexistence of the generalist–common Harmonia axyridis and specialist–rare H. yedoensis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). Direct predation effect of cannibalism and IGP was asymmetric in the two sibling ladybird beetles; the fourth instar larvae of H . axyridis were better intraguild predators than cannibals, while the reverse was true in the larvae of H. yedoensis . Neither cannibalism nor IGP significantly affected female body weight in either species. Larval H . axyridis surviving exposure to cannibalism or IGP had a reduced number of ovarioles as adults, whereas adult H. yedoensis ovarioles were not affected. For the indirect effects, longer developmental times in males and females and a lower total number of ovarioles in females were detected in H . axyridis . In H. yedoensis , shorter developmental time of males, lighter adult weight and fewer total ovarioles in females were observed. Olfactometer choice experiments clarified that the fourth instar larvae of H . axyridis avoided the first instar conspecific larvae, while those of H. yedoensis were attracted to the odors from H . axyridis and conspecifics. Thus, H . axyridis has an avoidance mechanism only for cannibalism but not for IGP , whereas H. yedoensis does not have any avoidance mechanism. These different behaviors in the direct and indirect effects of cannibalism and IGP observed in the laboratory may play important roles in the coexistence of generalist–common H . axyridis and specialist–rare H. yedoensis in natural conditions, compensating for the large handicap of H. yedoensis at reproductive interference from H . axyridis .",https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.6326,0
223,Short-Term Apparent Competition,"Interspecific interactions reflect the cumulative consequences of individual behavioral acts. The foraging decisions made by predators influence the way in which predation shapes the structure of prey communities. Alternative prey species co-occurring in a patch embedded in a matrix of many similar patches may interact through a shared mobile predator in two distinct ways. First, the functional response by an individual predator foraging in the patch to one prey species may be affected by the density of a second prey species in the patch (e.g., any time spent handling one prey reduces the time available for capturing other prey). Second, the presence of a second prey species may alter the propensity of predators to aggregate or remain in a given patch. We argue that this aggregative numerical response can in many circumstances generate -, - interactions (apparent competition) between prey species that otherwise would not interact. This is most likely if predators use a simple optimality criterion for prey selectivity within patches and the marginal-value theorem for deciding when to enter and leave patches. By contrast, if predators have suboptimal diets within patches but leave in accord with the marginal-value theorem, alternative prey may experience a +, - interaction; and, if predators use patches independently of prey availability, a +, + interaction between alternative prey can occur. Hence, the qualitative character of the interaction between alternative prey in a patchy environment depends on the degree to which predators do, or do not, match the canonical predictions of optimal foraging theory.",https://doi.org/10.1086/284718,0
224,"APPARENT COMPETITION, QUANTITATIVE FOOD WEBS, AND THE STRUCTURE OF PHYTOPHAGOUS INSECT COMMUNITIES","▪ Abstract Phytophagous insects and their natural enemies make up one of the largest and most diverse groups of organisms on earth. Ecological processes, in particular negative indirect effects mediated by shared natural enemies (apparent competition), may be important in structuring phytophagous insect communities. The potential for indirect interactions can be assessed by analyzing the trophic structure of insect communities, and we claim that quantitative food webs are particularly well suited for this task. We review the experimental evidence for both short-term and long-term apparent competition in phytophagous insect communities and discuss the possible interactions between apparent competition and intraguild predation or shared mutualists. There is increasing evidence for the importance of trait-mediated as well as density-mediated indirect effects. We conclude that there is a need for large-scale experiments manipulating communities in their entirety and a greater integration of community and chemical ecology.",https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ento.51.110104.151120,0
225,"Endangered, apparently: the role of apparent competition in endangered species conservation","Abstract Conservation biologists have reported growing evidence of food‐web interactions as causes of species endangerment. Apparent competition is an indirect interaction among prey species mediated by a shared predator, and has been increasingly linked to declines of prey species across taxa. We review theoretical and empirical studies of apparent competition, with specific attention to the mechanisms of asymmetry among apparently competing prey species. Asymmetry is theoretically driven by niche overlap, species fitness traits, spatial heterogeneity and generalist predator behavior. In real‐world systems, human‐induced changes to ecosystems such as habitat alteration and introduced species may be ultimate sources of species endangerment. However, apparent competition is shown to be a proximate mechanism when resultant changes introduce or subsidize abundant primary prey for predator populations. Demonstration of apparent competition is difficult due to the indirect relationships between prey and predator species and the potential for concurrent exploitative competition or other community effects. However, general conclusions are drawn concerning the characteristics of prey and predator species likely to exhibit asymmetric apparent competition, and the options for recovering endangered species. While short‐term management may be required to avoid imminent extinction in systems demonstrating apparent competition, we propose adaptive conservation efforts directed at long‐term recovery.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-1795.2009.00328.x,0
226,"Invasion by the Variegated Leafhopper and Biotic Interactions: Parasitism, Competition, and Apparent Competition","In 1980 the variegated leafhopper (VLH), Erythroneura variabilis, invaded California's San Joaquin Valley, and has since rapidly increased in numbers to become a major pest in vineyards. Correlated with the invasion by VLH are declining populations of congeneric grape leafhopper (GLH), E. elegantula. This paper explores interspecific competition and shared parasitism as possible reasons for this decline in GLH. Although interspecific competition between VLH and GLH was evident in field—cage experiments, its effects were equivalent to instraspecific competition. Instead of simple direct competition explaining the replacement of GLH by the invading VLH, the key appears to be parasitoid that is shared by two leafhoppers. In particular, the native GLH experiences higher attack rates from the shared parasitoid (Angarus epos) than does the invading VLH. This differential parasitism apparently shifts the competitive balance from one of equality to a strong disadvantage for the native relative to the invader. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to document the importance of parasitoid—mediated indirect effects in an invasion.",https://doi.org/10.2307/1938283,0
227,APPARENT COMPETITION WITH AN EXOTIC PLANT REDUCES NATIVE PLANT ESTABLISHMENT,"Biological invasions can change ecosystem function, have tremendous economic costs, and impact human health; understanding the forces that cause and maintain biological invasions is thus of immediate importance. A mechanism by which exotic plants might displace native plants is by increasing the pressure of native consumers on native plants, a form of indirect interaction termed ""apparent competition."" Using experimental exclosures, seed addition, and monitoring of small mammals in a California grassland, we examined whether exotic Brassica nigra increases the pressure of native consumers on a native bunchgrass, Nassella pulchra. Experimental plots were weeded to focus entirely on indirect effects via consumers. We demonstrate that B. nigra alters the activity of native small-mammal consumers, creating a gradient of consumption that dramatically reduces N. pulchra establishment. Previous work has shown that N. pulchra is a strong competitor, but that it is heavily seed limited. By demonstrating that consumer pressure is sufficient to curtail establishment, our work provides a mechanism for this seed limitation and suggests that, despite being a good competitor, N. pulchra cannot reestablish close to B. nigra within its old habitats because exotic-mediated consumption preempts direct competitive exclusion. Moreover, we find that apparent competition has a spatial extent, suggesting that consumers may dictate the rate of invasion and the area available for restoration, and that nonspatial studies of apparent competition may miss important dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1890/07-0223.1,0
228,"Indirect Interactions Between Prey: Apparent Competition, Predator Aggregation, and Habitat Segregation","Field experiments were performed to explore the nature of indirect interactions between two groups of ecologically distinct prey that occur on subtidal rocky reefs at Santa Catalina Island, California. Mobile gastropods (Tegula aureotincta, Tegula eiseni, and Astraea undosa) and sessile bivalves (mostly Chama arcana) share a common set of invertebrate predators (lobster Panulirus interrupts, cephalopod Octopus bimaculatus, and whelk Kelletia kelletii). The gastropods, which are secondarily preferred prey, principally occur on cobble reefs and less commonly on high-relief boulder reefs. Sessile bivalves and other species of favored prey are common on high-relief reefs and are rare or absent in cobble areas. The density of each predator species is greatest in high-relief areas containing abundant favored prey. Addition of bivalves to replicate cobble plots resulted in marked increases in predator density, relative to controls, because predators aggregated to areas containing favored prey. Greater densities of predators in the presence of experimentally added bivalves resulted in greater mortality and lower population densities of gastropods relative to controls. Conversely, mortality of Chama was higher where gastropods were common compared with cobble areas containing fewer gastropods. This occurred because the density of predators within a cobble reef, although low overall, was positively correlated with density of gastropods. Thus each group of prey was negatively affected by the presence of the other because each alternative prey increased the local density of predators. Such a doubly negative indirect interaction between prey, mediated by a shared predator, is known as a pparent competition; this is the first experimental demonstration of its existence. Because gastropods and bivalves are superior at withstanding predation in different habitats, shared predation and apparent competition may be sufficient mechanisms to maintain the pattern of habitat segregation displayed by these prey groups.",https://doi.org/10.2307/1939880,0
229,Apparent competition can compromise the safety of highly specific biocontrol agents,"Abstract Despite current concern about the safety of biological control of weeds, assessing the indirect impacts of introduced agents is not common practice. Using 17 replicate food webs, we demonstrate that the use of a highly host‐plant specific weed biocontrol agent, recently introduced into Australia, is associated with declines of local insect communities. The agent shares natural enemies (predators and parasitoids) with seed herbivore species from native plants, so apparent competition is the most likely cause for these losses. Both species richness and abundance in insect communities (seed herbivores and their parasitoids) were negatively correlated with the abundance of the biocontrol agent. Local losses of up to 11 species (dipteran seed herbivores and parasitoids) took place as the biocontrol agent abundance increased. Ineffective biocontrol agents that remain highly abundant in the community are most likely to have persistent, indirect negative effects. Our findings suggest that more investment is required in pre‐release studies on the effectiveness of biocontrol agents, as well as in post‐release studies assessing indirect impacts, to avoid or minimize the release of potentially damaging species.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01184.x,0
230,Apparent competition with an invasive plant hastens the extinction of an endangered lupine,"Invasive plants may compete with native plants by increasing the pressure of native consumers, a mechanism known as “apparent competition.” Apparent competition can be as strong as or stronger than direct competition, but the role of apparent competition has rarely been examined in biological invasions. We used four years of demographic data and seed‐removal experiments to determine if introduced grasses caused elevated levels of seed consumption on native plant species in a coastal dune system in California, USA. We show that the endangered, coastal dune plant Lupinus tidestromii experiences high levels of pre‐dispersal seed consumption by the native rodent Peromyscus maniculatus due to its proximity to the invasive grass, Ammophila arenaria . We use stage‐structured, stochastic population models to project that two of three study populations will decline toward extinction under ambient levels of consumption. For one of these declining populations, a relatively small decrease in consumption pressure should allow for persistence. We show that apparent competition with an invasive species significantly decreases the population growth rate and persistence of a native species. We expect that apparent competition is an important mechanism in other ecosystems because invasive plants often change habitat structure and plant–consumer interactions. Possible implications of the apparent‐competition mechanism include selective extinction of species preferred by seed consumers in the presence of an invasive species and biological homogenization of communities toward non‐preferred native plant species.",https://doi.org/10.1890/09-0418.1,0
231,HERBIVORE-MEDIATED APPARENT COMPETITION BETWEEN TWO SALT MARSH FORBS,"Indirect negative interactions between prey species that share a predator, referred to as apparent competition, have been modeled extensively. However, experimental studies examining the importance of apparent competition in the field are sparse, especially in plant–herbivore systems. In this study, I examined the role of a beetle herbivore, Erynephala maritima, in mediating the indirect effects of an abundant host plant, Salicornia europaea, on a less common host species, Atriplex patula var. hastata, in New England salt marshes. To examine these relationships, I manipulated plant density (plants with vs. without neighbors) and composition (conspecific neighbors vs. Salicornia neighbors) surrounding focal Atriplex plants, as well as the presence or absence of herbivores in a field experiment. Densities of both beetle eggs and larvae were significantly greater in plots with Salicornia, suggesting that its presence increases patch location or selection by herbivores. Higher insect densities resulted in significantly higher levels of herbivore damage to Atriplex within Salicornia-addition plots compared with high- and low-density Atriplex plots. Thus the identity, and not just density, of neighboring plants is important in determining levels of herbivory. Increased herbivore damage in Salicornia-addition plots resulted in a concomitant decrease in Atriplex survival and reproductive output. Furthermore, the negative effect of Salicornia on Atriplex survival and fruit production only occurred in the presence of herbivores, indicating that competitive effects are indirect rather than direct. Thus, Salicornia has a strong apparent competitive effect on Atriplex. Cross-site surveys suggested that the pattern of increased herbivore damage to Atriplex associated with increases in local Salicornia density is common and widespread. Overall, the results suggest that the apparent competitive effect of Salicornia is likely a major determinant of patterns of Atriplex abundance both between habitat patches and across marsh zones.

232,Apparent competition and insect community structure: towards a spatial perspective,"Competition has been widely discussed as a process that may structure communities of plants and animals. Its role in insect communities is less clear, especially as many insect species do not appear to compete for resources. However, such communities could still be structured by where the species interact through shared natural enemies. We explore recent attempts to assess whether apparent competition may structure herbivorous insect communities. Communities can be described by quantitative food webs from which the potential for apparent competition can be inferred. We illustrate both the construction of a diverse quantitative food web and a field experimental test of apparent competition using our work on leaf-miner communities in Belize. We consider how a spatial perspective may be incorporated into our leaf-miner community research, and speculate about the shape of apparent competition kernels and their relevance for the structure of herbivorous insect communities.",,0
233,Impacts of temporal variation on apparent competition and coexistence in open ecosystems,"The natural world is variable both in space and in time, but little ecological theory has been explicitly devoted to analyzing the consequences of both kinds of variability operating simultaneously. This issue is examined relative to the indirect interaction of apparent competition, which can limit the membership of prey communities. One limiting case that provides a useful starting point is to imagine that a local community is influenced by coupling with an external source landscape, but has little reciprocal influence on that landscape. There usually will be some rate of input of a locally inferior species that suffices to ‘swamp’ a superior species and drive it to extinction. We use simple models of apparent competition to show that when one superimposes upon this scenario temporal fluctuations, mediated through shifts in parameter values, such variation can either magnify the importance of the external input, or reduce it, depending on which component of the system experiences variation. We examine this in the case of both slow variation (for which we suggest a protocol that may be useful in a wide range of ecological models), and fast variation. The theoretical studies presented here provide examples of the rich range of outcomes that may arise due to temporal variability in spatially heterogeneous landscapes.",https://doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12570.x,0
234,Using Predator-Prey Theory to Predict Outcomes of Broadscale Experiments to Reduce Apparent Competition,"Apparent competition is an important process influencing many ecological communities. We used predator-prey theory to predict outcomes of ecosystem experiments aimed at mitigating apparent competition by reducing primary prey. Simulations predicted declines in secondary prey following reductions in primary prey because predators consumed more secondary prey until predator numbers responded to reduced prey densities. Losses were exacerbated by a higher carrying capacity of primary prey and a longer lag time of the predator's numerical response, but a gradual reduction in primary prey was less detrimental to the secondary prey. We compared predictions against two field experiments where endangered woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) were victims of apparent competition. First, when deer (Odocoileus sp.) declined suddenly following a severe winter, cougar (Puma concolor) declined with a 1–2-year lag, yet in the interim more caribou were killed by cougars, and caribou populations declined by 40%. Second, when moose (Alces alces) were gradually reduced using a management experiment, wolf (Canis lupus) populations declined but did not shift consumption to caribou, and the largest caribou subpopulation stabilized. The observed contrasting outcomes of sudden versus gradual declines in primary prey supported theoretical predictions. Combining theory with field studies clarified how to manage communities to mitigate endangerment caused by apparent competition that affects many taxa.",https://doi.org/10.1086/680510,0
235,Apparent competition drives community-wide parasitism rates and changes in host abundance across ecosystem boundaries,"Abstract Species have strong indirect effects on others, and predicting these effects is a central challenge in ecology. Prey species sharing an enemy (predator or parasitoid) can be linked by apparent competition, but it is unknown whether this process is strong enough to be a community-wide structuring mechanism that could be used to predict future states of diverse food webs. Whether species abundances are spatially coupled by enemy movement across different habitats is also untested. Here, using a field experiment, we show that predicted apparent competitive effects between species, mediated via shared parasitoids, can significantly explain future parasitism rates and herbivore abundances. These predictions are successful even across edges between natural and managed forests, following experimental reduction of herbivore densities by aerial spraying of insecticide over 20 hectares. This result shows that trophic indirect effects propagate across networks and habitats in important, predictable ways, with implications for landscape planning, invasion biology and biological control.",https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms12644,0
236,Differential impact of a shared nematode parasite on two gamebird hosts: implications for apparent competition,"If the deleterious effects of non-specific parasites are greater on vulnerable host species than on reservoir host species then exclusion of the vulnerable host through apparent competition is more likely. Evidence suggests that such a mechanism occurs in interactions between the ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), the grey partridge (Perdix perdix), and their shared caecal nematode Heterakis gallinarum. Modelling of the system predicts that the reduced parasite impact on the pheasant compared to the partridge results in the force of infection transmitted from pheasants to partridges being sufficient to cause partridge exclusion. Since the parasite impacts are currently estimated from correlational work, controlled infections were conducted to experimentally compare the impact of H. gallinarum on the two hosts and verify cause and effect. While challenged partridges showed reduced mass gain, decreased food consumption, and impaired caecal activity, in comparison to controls, the only detectable effect of parasite challenge on the pheasant was impaired caecal activity. The impact of H. gallinarum on challenged partridges conforms with previous correlational data, supporting the prediction that parasite-mediated apparent competition with the ring-necked pheasant may result in grey partridge exclusion. However, the observed decrease in the caecal activity of challenged pheasants could imply that H. gallinarum may also have an impact on the fecundity and survival of pheasants in the wild, particularly if food is limiting. If this is the case, the associated decrease in the force of infection to which the partridge is exposed may be sufficient to change the model prediction from partridge exclusion to pheasant and partridge coexistence.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0031182001007247,0
237,Geographic variation in apparent competition between native and invasive <i>Phragmites australis</i>,"Apparent competition, the negative interaction between species mediated by shared natural enemies, is thought to play an important role in shaping the structure and dynamics of natural communities. However, its importance in driving species invasions, and whether the strength of this indirect interaction varies across the latitudinal range of the invasion, has not been fully explored. We performed replicated field experiments at four sites spanning 900 km along the Atlantic Coast of the United States to assess the presence and strength of apparent competition between sympatric native and invasive lineages of Phragmites australis. Four herbivore guilds were considered: stem-feeders, leaf-miners, leaf-chewers and aphids. We also tested the hypothesis that the strength of this interaction declines with increasing latitude. Within each site, native and invasive plants of P. australis were cross-transplanted between co-occurring native and invasive patches in the same marsh habitat and herbivore damage was evaluated at the end of the growing season. Apparent competition was evident for both lineages and involved all but the leaf-chewer guild. For native plants, total aphids per plant was 296% higher and the incidence of stem-feeding and leaf-mining herbivores was 34% and 221% higher, respectively, when transplanted into invasive than native patches. These data suggest that invasive P. australis has a negative effect on native P. australis via apparent competition. Averaged among herbivore types, the indirect effects of the invasive lineage on the native lineage was 57% higher than the reverse situation, suggesting that apparent competition was asymmetric. We also found that the strength of apparent competition acting against the native lineage was comparable to the benefits to the invasive lineage from enemy release (i.e., proportionately lower mean herbivory of the invasive relative to the native taxa). Finally, we found the first evidence that the strength of apparent competition acting against the native lineage (from stem-feeders only) decreased with increasing latitude. These results suggest that not only could apparent competition be of tantamount importance to enemy release in enhancing the establishment and spread of invasive taxa, but also that these indirect and direct herbivore effects could vary over the invasion range.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.1646,0
238,Apparent competition and native consumers exacerbate the strong competitive effect of an exotic plant species,"Direct and indirect effects can play a key role in invasions, but experiments evaluating both are rare. We examined the roles of direct competition and apparent competition by exotic Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) by manipulating (1) L. maackii vegetation, (2) presence of L. maackii fruits, and (3) access to plants by small mammals and deer. Direct competition with L. maackii reduced the abundance and richness of native and exotic species, and native consumers significantly reduced the abundance and richness of native species. Although effects of direct competition and consumption were more pervasive, richness of native plants was also reduced through apparent competition, as small-mammal consumers reduced richness only when L. maackii fruits were present. Our experiment reveals the multiple, interactive pathways that affect the success and impact of an invasive exotic plant: exotic plants may directly benefit from reduced attack by native consumers, may directly exert strong competitive effects on native plants, and may also benefit from apparent competition.",https://doi.org/10.1890/14-0732.1,0
239,The foraging behavior of granivorous rodents and short-term apparent competition among seeds,"The foraging behavior of a predator species is thought to be the cause of short-term apparent competition among those prey species that share the predator. Short-term apparent competition is the negative indirect effect that one prey species has on another prey species via its effects on predator foraging behavior. In theory, the density-dependent foraging behavior of granivorous rodents and their preference for certain seeds are capable of inducing short-term apparent competition among seed species. In this study, I examined the foraging behavior of two heteromyid rodent species (family Heteromyidae), Merriam's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys merriami) and little pocket mice (Perognathus longimembris). In one experiment I tested the preferences of both rodent species for the seeds of eight plant species. Both rodent species exhibited distinct but variable preferences for some seeds and avoidance of others. However, the differences in preference appeared to have only an occasional effect on the strength of the short-term apparent competition detected in a field experiment. In another experiment, I found that captive individuals of both rodent species had approximately equal foraging effort (i.e., time spent foraging) in patches that contained a highly preferred seed type (Oryzopsis hymenoides) regardless of seed density and the presence of a less preferred seed type (Astragalus cicer) in the patches. The rodents also harvested a large proportion of O. hymenoides seeds regardless of initial seed density; this precluded a negative indirect effect of A. cicer on O. hymenoides. But there was a negative indirect effect of O. hymenoides on A. cicer caused by rodents having a lower foraging effort in patches that only contained A. cicer seeds than in patches that contained A. cicer and O. hymenoides seeds. The indirect interaction between O. hymenoides and A. cicer thus represented a case of short-term apparent competition that was non-reciprocal. Most importantly, it was caused by the foraging behavior of the rodents.",https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/12.4.467,0
240,Apparent Competition or Apparent Mutualism? Shared Predation When Populations Cycle,"We use simple mathematical models to explore the indirect interactions between two prey species that share a predator when all three species undergo population cycles. The results are compared to analogous findings for systems that reach a stable equilibrium point. It is common for removal of one prey from a cycling system to result in a decrease in the mean density of the remaining prey species, contrary to the usual logic of apparent competition. Even when apparent competition between prey exists, its magnitude is usually reduced by population cycles. This effect occurs when the predator has a concave-down relationship between prey abundance and its own per capita growth rate. Such relationships can occur because of a saturating functional or numerical response. We investigate how prey density dependence and the shape of the predator's functional and numerical responses affect the sign and magnitude of this indirect interaction between prey species. There may also be (+, −) interactions between prey that differ significantly in their susceptibility to the common predator.",https://doi.org/10.2307/176875,0

Apparent mutualism results when multiple prey species reduce predation risk for each other by altering a predator's functional response. Short-term apparent competition occurs when multiple prey species increase predation risks for each other through the numerical response, i.e. increasing the predator's birth rate, or aggregative response, i.e. attracting a higher density of predators. Our objectives in this study were to determine the aggregative response and 2-prey functional response of a predator and to examine indirect effects over a range of prey densities. We used the clam Macoma balthica and juvenile blue crabs Callinectes sapidus as prey for adult blue crabs. In laboratory experiments, we determined the single-prey functional responses of the crabs to each prey species and the 2-prey functional response. We combined the 2-prey functional response with the known blue crab aggregative response to clams to estimate field predation rates. Our model predicts that at low prey densities, clams and juvenile blue crabs exhibit apparent mutualism, whereas at high clam densities, this relation switches to short-term apparent competition. These unexpected results highlight the need to incorporate multiple aspects of predation at multiple scales when considering indirect effects.

242,Predatory fishes affect trophic cascades and apparent competition in temperate reefs,"We provide evidence for a trophic cascade involving apex predators and mesopredators of marine temperate reefs, lingcod and rockfish, respectively. We measured spatio-temporal variation in the relative abundance of lingcod, subadult rockfish and two shrimp groups eaten by rockfish ( Pandalus sp. and three smaller-bodied genera aggregated). Lingcod had an indirect positive effect on shrimps, as mediated by the direct negative effects of lingcod on rockfish and of rockfish on shrimps. These top-down effects on shrimps, however, were stronger for Pandalus than for small-bodied shrimps. Further, abundances of Pandalus and small-bodied shrimps were negatively correlated and the latter had a stronger positive effect on rockfish, suggesting that rockfish mediated asymmetrical apparent competition between shrimps. Our results indicate mechanisms by which predatory fishes may influence the structure of marine communities.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2010.0034,0
243,Apparent competition or apparent mutualism? An analysis of the influence of rose bush strip management on aphid population in wheat field,"Abstract: Apparent competition, mediated by a shared predator, plays a key role in conservation biological control. Appropriate agroecosystems management may favour this type of indirect interaction. In that context, our aim was to test the effect of rose bush [ Rosa rugosa (Thunb.)] strips on the building up of aphid populations and of their natural enemies in adjacent cereal habitats. Several aphid species are currently found on Rosa sp. including Metopolophium dirhodum (Walker) for which it is a primary host. Aphid predators and parasitoids may build their populations on the aphid population present on Rosa sp. and later on migrate to wheat field during the cereal aphid infestation. Moreover, the flowers of the rose bushes may provide a source of nectar and pollen to these natural enemies. Our experiment was conducted in three rose margin wheat plots with a strip of rose bushes of R. rugosa and three control plots. Plots were compared during 2 years (2003 and 2004). Aphid, parasitoid and predator densities were recorded from May to the harvest of wheat on rose bushes and in wheat. In 2003, the aphid densities were moderate but in 2004, the population of aphid was very high. Even if predator and parasitoids arrived earlier in rose margin field than in control ones, the presence of rose bushes did not influence the aphid population within the field. Metopolophium dirhodum did not seem to migrate from the rose bushes to wheat. The level of parasitism was weak in rose bushes and the natural enemy population was not different in rose margin wheat and in control plots. The causes of the lack of efficiency of this type of management are discussed as well as the high aphid population in wheat in 2004.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01157.x,0
244,Herbivore density mediates the indirect effect of herbivores on plants via induced resistance and apparent competition,"Abstract Herbivore‐induced plant resistance and apparent competition are two indirect ways herbivores interact. If a less damaging herbivore indirectly suppresses the abundance of a more damaging herbivore via these mechanisms, then plants may ultimately benefit. Changes in herbivore density, however, can dictate the intensity of species interactions and may play a critical role in determining the outcome of plant‐ and predator‐mediated herbivore interactions. We tested the effects of herbivore density on the strength of indirect interactions among phloem‐feeding aphids and herbivorous caterpillars and the outcome of these interactions for their shared host plant, cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum ). We quantified the survival of caterpillars on host plants that were infested with varying densities of aphids in the presence and absence of predators (ladybeetles). We found that aphids induced defensive proteins in cotton plants and that caterpillar survival was negatively affected by induced resistance. Likewise, we found that the presence of aphids increased predation of caterpillars by ladybeetles, but that apparent competition between aphids and caterpillars was density dependent. Ladybeetles consumed relatively high numbers of small caterpillars at low to intermediate aphid densities, but essentially became aphid specialists at high aphid densities. Aphid induced defenses and apparent competition combined such that plant damage by caterpillars was lowest when predators were present at low aphid density (induced resistance + highest level of apparent competition). This suggests that herbivores can benefit plants, but the effect on host plants is mediated by herbivore density. Indirect herbivore‐plant mutualisms may increase plant quality, plant fitness, and yield of crop plants and these interactions need to be considered in ecologically based pest management plans. In addition, these interactions likely alter arthropod community structure and natural selection on anti‐herbivore defense traits in plants in natural systems.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1218,0
245,Insect-mediated apparent competition between mammals in a boreal food web,"Significance Despite the growing recognition that indirect interactions within species networks can determine food web dynamics, empirical evidence remains rare. We demonstrate how the impact of insects on forest structure and composition can reverberate across trophic levels by altering apparent competition in a large-mammal food web subjected to timber extraction. Spruce budworm outbreaks initiated a flush in deciduous vegetation that benefited moose, which translated into apparent competition between moose and boreal caribou through wolf predation. Mortality risk of caribou became indirectly related to patterns of insect and human activities, with the ungulate experiencing higher risk when selecting stands severely infested by budworms and subsequently logged. We expose cascading effects of insect–forest interactions on large-mammal relations in human-altered ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2022892118,0
246,Numerical response of mammalian carnivores to rodents affects bird reproduction in temperate forests: A case of apparent competition?,"Abstract Resource pulses such as mast seeding in temperate forests may affect interspecific interactions over multiple trophic levels and link different seed and nonseed consumers directly via predation or indirectly via shared predators. However, the nature and strength of interactions among species remain unknown for most resource pulse–driven ecosystems. We considered five hypotheses concerning the influence of resource pulses on the interactions between rodents, predators, and bird reproduction with data from northern Switzerland collected between 2010 and 2015. In high‐rodent‐abundance‐years (HRAYs), wood warbler ( Phylloscopus sibilatrix ) nest survival was lower than in low‐rodent‐abundance‐years, but rodents were not important nest predators, in contrast to rodent‐hunting predators. The higher proportion of nests predated by rodent‐hunting predators and their increased occurrence in HRAYs suggests a rodent‐mediated aggregative numerical response of rodent‐hunting predators, which incidentally prey on the wood warbler's ground nests. There was no evidence that rodent‐hunting predators responded behaviorally by switching prey. Lastly, nest losses caused by nonrodent‐hunting predators were not related to rodent abundance. We show that wood warblers and rodents are linked via shared predators in a manner consistent with apparent competition, where an increase of one species coincides with the decrease of another species mediated by shared predators. Mast seeding frequency and annual seed production appear to have increased over the past century, which may result in more frequent HRAYs and generally higher peaking rodent populations. The associated increase in the magnitude of apparent competition may thus at least to some extent explain the wood warbler's decline in much of Western Europe.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.4608,0
247,Optimal foraging by an aphid parasitoid affects the outcome of apparent competition,"Apparent competition is an indirect, negative interaction occurring between two or more host species, mediated by a shared parasitoid. Host species' population growth rates, parasitoid attack rates, and parasitoid population size can mediate the outcomes of apparent competition. It has also been suggested that optimal foraging by a natural enemy can influence the outcome of apparent competition, resulting in increased suppression of the optimal host. While this has been shown in theory, to date no studies have empirically tested the link between parasitoid optimal foraging behaviour and the outcome of apparent competition. The present study examined how optimal foraging behaviour influences the outcome of apparent competition in an aphid banker plant system. First, Aphidius colemani V iereck's preference for Myzus persicae S ulzer or Rhopalosiphum padi L ., the non‐pest host on the banker plant, was examined, and then the difference in M. persicae suppression in the presence and absence of R. padi was assessed. It was found that optimal foraging behaviour led female A. colemani to prefer M. persicae over R. padi , due to increased offspring survival and female size. Consequently, optimally foraging A. colemani parasitised significantly more M. persicae in the presence of both aphid hosts than in the presence of M. persicae alone.

248,White-tailed deer browse on an invasive shrub with extended leaf phenology meets assumptions of an apparent competition hypothesis,"It has been hypothesized that invasive plant species with extended leaf phenology (ELP) elevate generalist herbivore populations, increasing herbivory on native plants (apparent competition). This hypothesis assumes that consumption of the invasive is associated with periods of ELP, the invasive is a major component of the herbivore's diet, and that it is more nutritious than native plants during periods of ELP. We tested these assumptions by estimating the proportion of the white-tailed deer diet comprised of Lonicera maackii, an invasive shrub with ELP, quantifying the seasonal pattern of deer browse on this invasive shrub, and comparing its nutritional quality to leafless woody stems. In the Miami University Natural Areas in southwest Ohio we quantified the frequency of leafy twigs of woody species 0.3–2.1 m high in three habitats (deciduous forest, Juniperus virginiana forest, and forest-field edge). Monthly we quantified deer browse on marked L. maackii twigs, and estimated the mass of leaf and stem tissue consumed with allometric relationships using diameter and length of unbrowsed twig portions. We estimated the percent of the annual deer diet comprised of L. maackii by dividing the sum of these estimates by the product of deer abundance (estimated by pellet-based distance sampling) and consumption estimates from the literature. Crude protein of L. maackii stems and leaves was determined by C:N analyser. In each habitat the frequency of L. maackii was greater than all other woody species combined. We estimated L. maackii comprised 14–47 % of the annual deer diet. Deer browsed L. maackii each month, but consumption was high in early spring and late summer. Crude protein of leafy twigs of L. maackii in early spring was 12.9 %, much higher than leafless twigs of native species on-site. These findings support the assumptions of the hypothesis that invasive plants with ELP impact native plants via deer-mediated apparent competition.",https://doi.org/10.1093/aobpla/plx006,0
249,Spatial connectedness of plant species: potential links for apparent competition via plant diseases,"This study evaluated the reactions of seven common C 4 grasses of the tallgrass prairie of the USA G reat P lains to the economically important wheat pathogens P yrenophora tritici‐repentis and G aeumannomyces graminis var. tritici ( G gt) isolated from wheat. The P . tritici‐repentis isolates (race 1) were pathogenic on all grasses tested, but symptom severity was markedly low. Three of the grass species inoculated with G gt were highly susceptible, while four species exhibited no symptoms. Because measures of connectedness can provide a proxy for population processes, connectedness was evaluated within and among the seven grass species in representative tallgrass prairie environments for all potential pathogen‐sharing patterns. A ndropogon gerardii was ubiquitous, so all plant species were well connected to it. A ndropogon scoparius (= S chizachyrium scoparium ), S orghastrum nutans and P anicum virgatum were fairly common but specialized to particular environments. B outeloua curtipendula was uncommon but occurred in all environments, while B uchloë dactyloides and B outeloua gracilis were uncommon and only occurred in upland sites. Co‐occurrence of plant species was generally not reciprocal in that, for many species pairs, species A rarely occurred without potential exposure to inoculum from species B , while species B commonly occurred without species A . The three grass species susceptible to G gt may act as sources of inoculum for each other within tallgrass prairie, with the potential to influence fitness, and tallgrass prairie and commercial wheat ecosystems in the G reat P lains also have the potential to share both pathogens.",https://doi.org/10.1111/ppa.12045,0
250,Extended leaf phenology may drive plant invasion through direct and apparent competition,"Invasive plants can inflict great harm, yet drivers of successful invasion remain unclear. Many invaders of North American deciduous forests exhibit extended leaf phenology (ELP), or longer growing season relative to natives. ELP may grant invaders competitive advantages, but we argue that ELP more potently drives invasion in the presence of herbivores. ELP invaders can support herbivores by lessening starvation during winter; consequently, native plants may suffer when attacked later through apparent competition. As modeled here, even short ELP can promote competitive success of invaders, and apparent competition sharply enhances ELP invader dominance. In ‘partial enemy escape’ scenarios, a less palatable ELP invader nearly excludes a preferred native where an invader without ELP could not. Together, ELP and apparent competition enhance invasion even when biotic resistance should suppress it, i.e. when the invader competes weakly or provides preferred forage. Thus, ELP‐apparent competition interactions grant invaders considerable success while challenging core tenets of invasion ecology.",https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.02529,0
251,Temperature and depth mediate resource competition and apparent competition between <i>Mysis diluviana</i> and kokanee,"In many food webs, species in similar trophic positions can interact either by competing for resources or boosting shared predators (apparent competition), but little is known about how the relative strengths of these interactions vary across environmental gradients. Introduced Mysis diluviana shrimp interact with planktivorous fishes such as kokanee salmon (lacustrine Oncorhynchus nerka ) through both of these pathways, and effective management depends on understanding which interaction is more limiting under different conditions. An “environmental matching” hypothesis predicts the ecological impacts of Mysis are maximized under cool conditions near its thermal optimum. In addition, we hypothesized Mysis is more vulnerable to predation by lake trout in relatively shallow waters, and therefore Mysis enhances lake trout density and limits kokanee through apparent competition more strongly in shallower habitats. We tested whether these hypotheses could explain food web differences between two connected lake basins, one relatively shallow and the other extremely deep. The shallower basin warmed faster, thermally excluded Mysis from surface waters for 75% longer, and supported 2.5–18 times greater seasonal production of cladoceran zooplankton than the deeper basin, standardized by surface area. Mysis consumed 14–22% less zooplankton in the shallower basin, and lower ratios of total planktivore consumption to zooplankton production (C:P) indicated less potential for resource competition with kokanee, consistent with environmental matching. Lake trout diets contained more Mysis in the shallower basin and at shallower sampling sites within both basins. The catch rate of lake trout was seven times greater and the predation risk for kokanee was 4–5 times greater in the shallower basin than in the deeper basin, consistent with stronger apparent competition in shallower habitats. Understanding how the strengths of these interactions are mediated by temperature and depth would enable managers to select appropriate strategies to address the unique combinations of conditions in hundreds of affected systems.",https://doi.org/10.1890/14-1822.1,0
252,"Apparent Competition, Lion Predation, and Managed Livestock Grazing: Can Conservation Value Be Enhanced?","Predator restorations often result in apparent competition, where co-occurring prey populations experience asymmetric predation pressure driven by predator preferences. In many rangeland ecosystems, livestock share the landscape with wildlife, including ungulates and the large carnivores that consume them. We examined whether apparent competition reorganized prey communities following restoration of lions (Panthera leo) to a savanna ecosystem, and whether and how livestock management could alter this indirect interaction between lions and their prey. Three lines of evidence supported the hypothesis that Jackson's hartebeest (Alcelaphus bucelaphus lelwel; an ungulate of conservation concern) are suppressed via lion-mediated apparent competition. First, hartebeest exhibited an Allee effect where they were exposed to lions, but displayed negative density-dependent population growth where they were protected from lions. Second, spatial overlap between plains zebra (Equus burchelli; the primary prey of lions) and hartebeest further exacerbated lion predation on hartebeest. Finally, hartebeest were killed selectively by lions, whereas zebra were killed by lions in proportion to their abundance. We then tested whether glades (nutrient-rich hotspots created by abandoned cattle [Bos indicus] corrals) could be used to manipulate top-down control of hartebeest via their influence on the spatial distribution of zebra. Zebra aggregated at glades, and survival of hartebeest increased with increasing distance from glades, suggesting that corrals may be placed on the landscape away from hartebeest to create spatial refuges from lions. Our findings demonstrate how informed placement of livestock corrals can be used to manipulate the spatial distribution of primary prey (zebra), thereby reducing apparent competition suffered by hartebeest. Our work further provides an example of how integrating apparent competition theory with proactive livestock management can improve conservation efforts in multiple-use landscapes.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2019.00123,0
253,Apparent competition leaves no detectable imprint on patterns of community composition: observations from a natural experiment,"Indirect interactions mediated by natural enemies shared among herbivorous insects have recently attracted much interest. While many studies have predicted a high potential for apparent competition, only a few have rigorously tested predictions derived from the food web structure in terms of realised population and community dynamics. In this study, a quantified food web was used to identify pairs of herbivore species potentially tied by strong parasitoid‐mediated interactions. The host populations and their parasitism rates over two consecutive years were then followed, during which time the abundance of one dominant host crashed. Following this natural experiment, imprints of asymmetrical, long‐term apparent competition among hosts were sought in population growth rates. The population growth revealed no signs of apparent competition as mediated by parasitoids: the abundance and parasitism rates of less abundant herbivores were uncorrelated with the relative growth rate of four dominant herbivore species with which they shared a major part of their parasitoids. Likewise, the population crash of the dominant herbivore, Cynips longiventris , did not detectably affect the abundances or parasitism rates of other herbivores with which it shared a major fraction of its parasitoids. Overall, this case study fails to add evidence to previous suggestions that apparent competition may constitute a major force in structuring natural communities. However, it suggests that dynamics should not be inferred from static food web structure alone, but rather that predictions based on structure should be verified by empirical observations of realised population dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1111/een.12048,0
254,Snow Leopard Dietary Preferences and Livestock Predation Revealed by Fecal DNA Metabarcoding: No Evidence for Apparent Competition Between Wild and Domestic Prey,"Accurate assessments of the patterns and drivers of livestock depredation by wild carnivores are vital for designing effective mitigation strategies to reduce human-wildlife conflict. Snow leopard’s ( Panthera uncia ) range extensively overlaps pastoralist land-use and livestock predation there is widely reported, but the ecological determinants of livestock consumption by snow leopards remain obscure. We investigated snow leopard dietary habits at seven sites across the Sanjiangyuan region of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau (QTP), an area central to the species’ global range. Snow leopard abundance, wild prey composition, and livestock density varied among those sites, thus allowing us to test the effects of various factors on snow leopard diet and livestock predation. Using DNA metabarcoding, we obtained highly resolved dietary data from 351 genetically verified snow leopard fecal samples. We then analyzed the prey preferences of snow leopards and examined ecological factors related to their livestock consumption. Across the sites, snow leopard prey was composed mainly of wild ungulates (mean = 81.5% of dietary sequences), particularly bharal ( Pseudois nayaur ), and supplemented with livestock (7.62%) and smaller mammals (marmots, pikas, mice; 10.7%). Snow leopards showed a strong preference for bharal, relative to livestock, based on their densities. Interestingly, both proportional and total livestock consumption by snow leopards increased linearly with local livestock biomass, but not with livestock density. That, together with a slight negative relationship with bharal density, supports apparent facilitation between wild and domestic prey. We also found a significant positive correlation between population densities of snow leopard and bharal, yet those densities showed slight negative relationships with livestock density. Our results highlight the importance of sufficient wild ungulate abundance to the conservation of viable snow leopard populations. Additionally, livestock protection is critically needed to reduce losses to snow leopard depredation, especially where local livestock abundances are high.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2021.783546,0
255,Apparent competition between two species of aphid via the fungal pathogen <i>Erynia neoaphidis</i> and its interaction with the aphid parasitoid <i>Aphidius ervi</i>,"Abstract 1. Motivated by a community study on aphids and their fungal pathogens, three hypotheses were tested experimentally to investigate the influence of the fungal pathogen, Erynia neoaphidis Remaudière and Hennebert, on aphid population and community ecology. 2. Field experiments were performed in 2 years to test whether two susceptible aphid species on different host plants might interact through the shared fungal pathogen. No strong pathogen‐mediated indirect interactions (apparent competition) between populations of pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris and nettle aphid Microlophium carnosum Buckton were detected. 3. In the first of the field experiments, pea aphids exposed to the fungus showed a weak tendency to produce more winged dispersal morphs than control populations not exposed to the fungus. In a laboratory test, however, no support was found for the hypothesis that the presence of volatiles from fungus‐infected cadavers promotes production of winged offspring. 4. The response of the pea aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi Halliday to colonies containing hosts infected 1 and 3 days previously was assessed. Wasps initiated fewer attacks on 1‐day‐old infected colonies than on healthy colonies, with the numbers on 3‐day‐old fungus‐infected colonies intermediate.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2311.2002.00397.x,0
256,A Mathematical Model Supporting a Hyperpredation Effect in the Apparent Competition Between Invasive Eastern Cottontail and Native European Hare,"In this work a mathematical model is built in order to validate on theoretical grounds field study results on a three-species system made of two prey, of which one is native and another one invasive, together with a native predator. Specifically, our results mathematically describe the negative effect on the native European hare after the introduction of the invasive Eastern cottontail, mediated by an increased predation rate by foxes. Two nonexclusive assumptions can be made: an increase in cottontail abundance would lead to a larger fox population, magnifying their predatory impact (""hyperpredation"") on hares; alternatively, cottontails attract foxes in patches where they live, which are also important resting sites for hares and consequently the increased presence of foxes results in a higher predation rates on hares. The model results support hyperpredation of increasing fox populations on native hares.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11538-021-00873-9,0
257,EVOLUTIONARILY INDUCED ALTERNATIVE STATES AND COEXISTENCE IN SYSTEMS WITH APPARENT COMPETITION,"Predators often consume multiple prey and by mutually subsidizing a shared predator, the prey may reciprocally harm each other. When predation levels are high, this apparent competition can culminate in a prey species being displaced. Coupling quantitative genetics and Lotka-Volterra models, we study how predator evolution alters this and other ecological outcomes. These models account for a trade-off between the predator's attack rates on two prey species. We provide a mathematical characterization of a strong form of persistence--permanence--for which there is a global attractor bounded away from extinction. When the evolutionary dynamics occur at a sufficiently slower time scale than the ecological dynamics, we also characterize attractors and their basins' of attraction using singular perturbation theory and a graphical approach to the eco-evolutionary dynamics. Our results show that eco-evolutionary feedbacks can mediate permanence at intermediate trade-offs in the attack rates. However, at strong trade-offs, permanence is lost. Despite this loss of permanence, there can be attractors supporting coexistence. These attractors, however, may coincide with attractors at which the predator is excluded. Our results highlight that evo-evolutionary feedbacks can alter community structure by mediating coexistence or leading to trait-dependent alternative stable states.",https://doi.org/10.1111/nrm.12076,0
258,Apparent Competition and Vector-Host Interactions,"Infectious disease influences the dynamics of host populations and the structure of species communities via impacts on host demography. Species that share infectious diseases are well-known to interact indirectly through the process of apparent competition, but there has been little attention given to the role of vectors in these indirect interactions. Here we explore how vector-borne disease and host-vector interactions can drive apparent competitive interactions. We show that different facets of the ecology associated with vector-host-host interactions affect the structure of the three-species assemblage. Crucially, the patterns associated with invasion of alternative hosts, the spread of the infectious disease by the vector, and the dynamics of the community interactions are influenced by the mode of transmission. We highlight the role of alternative hosts on disease amplification, dilution and magnification and discuss the results with reference to recent developments in apparent competition and community structure.",https://doi.org/10.1560/ijee.56.3-4.393,0
259,Realized trophic niche driven by apparent competition: an example with marsupials,"Abstract According to apparent competition theory, the co‐occurrence of two species that share the same predators appears to affect each other's population growth and abundance. However, due to habitat loss and over‐hunting, top predators are being made rare worldwide. Considering that apparent competitors share similar resources, we would expect the absence of top predators to reflect in changes on prey realized trophic niches. To test our hypothesis, we developed a model to predict the abundance ratio of apparent competitor species based on changes in their realized trophic niches. We tested our model against field data on the Neotropical marsupials Didelphis aurita and Metachirus nudicaudatus . Our results revealed that D. aurita and M. nudicaudatus are two species under apparent competition and their realized trophic niche and diet overlap change according to the presence of top predators. The model was able to predict the actual relative abundances of D. aurita and M. nudicaudatus in the three empirical studies analyzed. Our study presents quantitative support to the apparent competition theory; however, the model's applications to other groups still need to be verified. Additionally, our study shows that the lack of top predators has consequences on the realized trophic niche of their prey, and therefore, we reinforce that conservation plans need to focus on the effects of top predator loss on ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1111/btp.12468,0
260,Chapter 24 Apparent Competition and Regulation in a Wolf-Ungulate System,"Theme The nonmigratory elk population in the Madison headwaters area of Yellowstone National Park appeared to be regulated near ecological carrying capacity by food limitation for at least three decades prior to the reestablishment of wolves. Eight years of post-wolf data indicated a substantial proportion of wolf predation was additive and overwhelmed any potential for the elk population to demographically compensate. Thus, wolf predation resulted in a 60–70% decrease in elk abundance and the system transitioned from being bottom-up regulated in the absence of a significant predator to strong top-down limitation due to wolf predation. However, it is uncertain if predation will ultimately regulate the elk population at a lower, alternate state or if predation and other factors influencing elk vulnerability will interact to result in further decreases in elk abundance. Fundamental to this question is the role of bison as an alternative prey for wolves. We discuss regulatory processes in predator–prey systems and present conceptual models that provide contrasting predictions for wolf-ungulate dynamics. We also characterize various aspects of prey vulnerability that may influence the effects of alternative prey on predation of the preferred prey and, in turn, the stability or instability of wolf multiple-prey systems. We conclude by evaluating support for these processes in data we have collected on Madison headwaters elk and predicting the future trajectory of the herd.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s1936-7961(08)00224-8,0
261,Effects of male targeted harvest regimes on prey switching by female mountain lions: Implications for apparent competition on declining secondary prey,"Apparent competition, or predator selection for rare secondary prey instead of abundant primary prey, is causing prey declines in many species worldwide. The causal mechanism for apparent competition is either lower intrinsic growth rate in the secondary prey or higher disproportionate predation by predators for secondary prey. Harvest regimes which target male carnivores are now widely accepted to result in increased sexually selected infanticide (SSI) because of rapid male turnover and immigration by non-sire males, and sexually segregated habitat use because of female avoidance of infanticidal males. If harvest regimes which target male mountain lions cause increased SSI and sexually segregated habitat use by females with young, it could also cause inverse prey switching by females with young or apparent competition in declining secondary prey. We tested for inverse prey switching by female mountain lions with young — from abundant increasing white-tailed deer at low elevations to declining mule deer at high elevations in a heavily hunted, sexually segregated population of mountain lions. The ""no effect of targeted male harvest"" hypothesis predicts that none or all sexes and reproductive classes of mountain lions will select for mule deer. The ""targeted male harvest effect"" hypothesis predicts that only females with young will select for declining mule deer. We rejected the ""no effect of targeted male harvest"" hypothesis and accepted the ""targeted male harvest effect"" hypothesis because only females with cubs selected for declining mule deer at high elevations and only during summer, when kittens were vulnerable to infanticide — other sex and reproductive classes selected for abundant increasing white-tailed deer at low elevations. We suggest that harvest regimes which focus on male harvest to reduce predation on declining secondary prey could be causing increased predation on declining secondary prey elsewhere.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2015.09.006,0
262,Indirect facilitation between prey promotes asymmetric apparent competition,"Apparent competition is one mechanism that can contribute to the complex dynamics observed in natural systems, yet it remains understudied in empirical systems. Understanding the dynamics that shape the outcome of processes like apparent competition is vital for appreciating how they influence natural systems. We empirically evaluated the role of indirect trophic interactions in driving apparent competition in a model laboratory system. Our experimental system was designed to let us evaluate combined direct and indirect interactions among species. Here we describe the results of a factorial experiment using two noncompeting prey (Colpidium kleini, a heterotroph, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, an autotroph) consumed by a generalist predator Euplotes eurystomus to explore the dynamics of apparent competition. To gain intuition into the potential mechanism driving the asymmetry in the observed results, we further explored the system using structural equation modelling. Our results show an important role of positive interactions and indirect effects contributing to apparent competition in this system with a marked asymmetrical outcome favouring one prey, Chlamydomonas. The selected structural equation supports a role of indirect facilitation; although Chlamydomonas (a photoautotroph) and Colpidium (a bacterivore) use different resources and therefor do not directly compete, Colpidium reduces bacteria that may compete with Chlamydomonas. In addition, formation of colonies by Chlamydomonas in response to predation by Euplotes provides an antipredator defence not available to Colpidium. Asymmetric apparent competition may be more common in natural systems than the symmetric interaction originally proposed in classic theory, suggesting that exploration of the mechanisms driving the asymmetry of the interaction can be a fruitful area of further research to better our understanding of interspecific interactions and community dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13768,0
263,CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH PLANTS HELP HERBIVORES AND BENEFIT FROM PREDATORS THROUGH APPARENT COMPETITION,"Leaf domatia are tiny structures in leaf vein axils that are typically inhabited by predatory and fungivorous mites. A recent article reported plant domatia specifically suited for herbivorous mites, which seems paradoxical, since the plant is thus supporting a natural enemy that can harm itself. The authors claimed that domatia are created to promote herbivorous mites as “fodder” for predatory mites that attack another herbivorous mite damaging the plant, and that the relationship among the plant, the fodder mite, and the predatory mite constitute a multiway mutualism because all three species benefit from the interaction. I formulate this system using two simple mathematical models of apparent competition, which differ in how domatia are modeled, and then assess when it is advantageous for the plant to create such space for a natural enemy. As a necessary condition for mutualism, the product of reproductive efficiency and nutritious value of the fodder prey should exceed that of the pest prey. This condition is also sufficient, if the direct costs for making the structure of domatia are negligible. If there are significant costs, however, the condition is broader for predators with lower reproductive efficiency and higher mortality, and for non-fodder prey with high consumption rate and low predation rate. I suggest that creating domatia is more effective when predators are less prolific and non-fodder prey are more severe as pests. Finally, I discuss how this mathematical model can apply to a wider range of tritrophic mutualistic relationships such as those among plants, aphids, and ants.",https://doi.org/10.1890/06-1298,0
264,Resource competition and apparent competition in declining mule deer (<i>Odocoileus</i> <i>hemionus</i>),"Resource competition and apparent competition have both been suggested as the cause of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus (Rafinesque, 1817)) decline concurrent with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmerman, 1780)) increase. I tested for both hypotheses by conducting a “press” and “release” experiment in a mule deer, white-tailed deer, and cougar (Puma concolor (L., 1771)) community. If resource competition is causal, then predation should decrease, but other sources of mortality should increase following increased mortality of cougars and release of competing white-tailed deer. If apparent competition is causal, then predation should decrease and mule deer should increase following increased mortality of cougars and release of white-tailed deer. I accepted the apparent competition hypothesis because high mortality of female cougars and cougar population decline was associated with both white-tailed deer and mule deer population growth. Very high mortality of female cougars appeared to result in mule deer population recovery. However, high mortality of male cougars (with increased male immigration) preceding high female mortality appeared to result in sexually segregated prey-switching by females with cubs from abundant white-tailed deer to rare mule deer to avoid sexually selected infanticide. High mortality of resident male cougars may have precipitated the mule deer decline in the first place.",https://doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2016-0109,0

Although the cause is unresolved, some studies have suggested that Gray Wolves (Canis lupus) contributed to the decline. After the Moose decline, wolves could either decline or switch prey. To determine which occurred in our study area, we compared winter wolf counts and summer diet before and after the Moose decline. While wolf numbers in our study area nearly doubled from 23 in winter 2002 to an average of 41 during winters 2011–2013, calf:cow ratios (the number of calves per cow observed during winter surveys) in the wider Moose range more than halved from 0.93 in 2002 to an average of 0.31 during 2011–2013. Compared to summer 2002, wolves in summers 2011–2013 consumed fewer Moose and more White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus). While deer densities were similar during each period, average vulnerability, as reflected by winter severity, was greater during 2011–2013 than 2002, probably explaining the wolf increase. During the wolf increase Moose calves remained a summer food item. These findings suggest that in part of the Moose range, deer subsidized wolf numbers while wolves also preyed on Moose calves. This contributed to a Moose decline and is a possible case of apparent competition and inverse-density-dependent predation.",https://doi.org/10.22621/cfn.v130i4.1924,0

267,Host-enemy interactions provide limited biotic resistance for a range-expanding species via reduced apparent competition,"Abstract As species ranges shift in response to anthropogenic change, they lose coevolved or coadapted interactions and gain novel ones in recipient communities. Range-expanding species may lose or experience weak antagonistic interactions with competitors and enemies, and traits of interacting species will determine the strength of interactions. We leveraged a poleward range expansion of an oak gall wasp that co-occurs on its host plant with other gall wasp species and interacts with shared natural enemies (largely parasitoid wasps). We created quantitative host-parasitoid interaction networks by sampling galls on 400 trees. We compared network structure and function and traits of hosts and parasitoids in the native and expanded range. Interaction networks were less diverse in the expanded range, with low complementarity of parasitoid assemblages among hosts. While whole networks were more generalized in the expanded range, interactions with the range-expanding species were more specialized. This was not due to a loss of specialist enemies but weak apparent competition by shared generalist enemies. Phenological divergence of enemy assemblages attacking the novel and co-occurring hosts was greater in the expanded range that may contribute to weak apparent competition. Given the rate and extent of anthropogenic-driven range expansions, it is pressing to uncover how complex biotic interactions are reassembled.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.28.498037,0
268,"From apparent competition to facilitation, impacts of consumer niche construction on the coexistence and stability of consumer-resource communities","Summary In addition to their direct trophic effects, some consumers have a positive indirect effect on their resource, due to niche construction. A predator can facilitate its prey resource acquisition, through prey transport, or through modifications of nutrient cycling. Other predators defend their prey against other predators, or actively manage it, as in agriculture, which is found in numerous taxa such as humans, but also ants, beetles, fishes and microbes. Here we investigate the ecological consequences of considering such positive effects in a simple two resource–one predator module, in which the consumer has a positive effect on one of the resources. We consider several scenarios, in which the positive effect of the resource is either non costly, ie resulting from a by-product of the consumer phenotype such as nutrient cycling, or costly. The cost either decreases the exploitation of the helped resource or the opportunity to forage the alternative resource. We show that by modifying the trophic interactions in the module, niche construction alters the apparent competition between the resources, thereby impacting their coexistence. We investigate how the intensity of niche construction impacts species coexistence, the distribution of biomass among the three species, and the stability of the community. When niche construction has little or no cost, it leads to higher consumer and helped resource densities, while decreasing the alternative resource density. Alternatively, when niche construction has a strong cost, the alternative resource can increase in density, niche construction thereby leading to the emergence of facilitative interactions among resource species.",https://doi.org/10.1101/332437,0
269,Limiting Similarity? The Ecological Dynamics of Natural Selection among Resources and Consumers Caused by Both Apparent and Resource Competition,"Much of ecological theory presumes that natural selection should foster species coexistence by phenotypically differentiating competitors so that the stability of the community is increased, but whether this will actually occur is a question of the ecological dynamics of natural selection. I develop an evolutionary model of consumer-resource interactions based on MacArthur's and Tilman's classic works, including both resource and apparent competition, to explore what fosters or retards the differentiation of resources and their consumers. Analyses of this model predict that consumers will differentiate only on specific ranges of environmental gradients (e.g., greater productivity, weaker stressors, lower structural complexity), and where it occurs, the magnitude of differentiation also depends on gradient position. In contrast to ""limiting similarity"" expectations, greater intraspecific phenotypic variance results in less differentiation among the consumers because of how phenotypic variation alters the fitness landscapes driving natural selection. In addition, the final structure of the community that results from the coevolution of these interacting species may be highly contingent on the initial properties of the species as the community is being assembled. These results highlight the fact that evolutionary conclusions about community structure cannot be based on ecological arguments of community stability or coexistence but rather must be explicitly based on the ecological dynamics of natural selection.",https://doi.org/10.1086/701629,0
270,Effects of Intraguild Predation: Evaluating Resource Competition between Two Canid Species with Apparent Niche Separation,"Many studies determine which habitat components are important to animals and the extent their use may overlap with competitive species. However, such studies are often undertaken after populations are in decline or under interspecific stress. Since habitat selection is not independent of interspecific stress, quantifying an animal's current landscape use could be misleading if the species distribution is suboptimal. We present an alternative approach by modeling the predicted distributions of two sympatric species on the landscape using dietary preferences and prey distribution. We compared the observed habitat use of kit foxes ( Vulpes macrotis ) and coyotes ( Canis latrans ) against their predicted distribution. Data included locations of kit foxes and coyotes, carnivore scat transects, and seasonal prey surveys. Although habitats demonstrated heterogeneity with respect to prey resources, only coyotes showed habitat use designed to maximize access to prey. In contrast, kit foxes used habitats which did not align closely with prey resources. Instead, habitat use by kit foxes represented spatial and behavioral strategies designed to minimize spatial overlap with coyotes while maximizing access to resources. Data on the distribution of prey, their dietary importance, and the species-specific disparities between predicted and observed habitat distributions supports a mechanism by which kit fox distribution is derived from intense competitive interactions with coyotes.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/629246,0

We used predator-prey theory to predict outcomes of ecosystem experiments aimed at mitigating apparent competition by reducing primary prey. Simulations predicted declines in secondary prey following reductions in primary prey because predators consumed more secondary prey until predator numbers responded to reduced prey densities. Losses were exacerbated by a higher carrying capacity of primary prey and a longer lag time of the predator’s numerical response, but a gradual reduction in primary prey was less detrimental to the secondary prey. We compared predictions against two field experiments where endangered woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) were victims of apparent competition. First, when deer (Odocoileus sp.) declined suddenly following a severe winter, cougar (Puma concolor) declined with a 1– 2-year lag, yet in the interim more caribou were killed by cougars, and caribou populations declined by 40%. Second, when moose (Alces alces) were gradually reduced using a management experiment, wolf (Canis lupus) populations declined but did not shift consumption to caribou, and the largest caribou subpopulation stabilized. The observed contrasting outcomes of sudden versus gradual declines in primary prey supported theoretical predictions. Combining theory with field studies clarified how to manage communities to mitigate endangerment caused by apparent competition that affects many taxa.",https://doi.org/10.26686/wgtn.12960971,0
272,Safety from predators or competitors? Interference competition leads to apparent predation risk,"Prey often react to predation risk by foraging preferentially in the safety of cover rather than in more risky open patches. Yet this pattern of patch use also can be caused by dominant interspecific competitors. We develop a simple theory of this form of apparent predation risk that describes the patch use of an optimal forager confronted with dominant individuals. The theory predicts that subordinate animals should increase their use of safe foraging patches as the density of nearby dominants increases. We tested the theory with meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) and southern red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi). We used dyadic encounters to confirm that meadow voles are dominant over red-backed voles. We then evaluated their respective foraging patterns in pairs of covered and open patches in 4 adjacent subgrids in an old-field enclosure. Subordinate red-backed voles foraged indifferently between covered and open patches when few meadow voles were present. Red-backed voles increased their use of both patches as the number of nearby meadow voles increased. Giving-up densities were lowest, and harvesting efficiency highest, in covered patches when the number of nearby meadow voles was high. These results document competition between the 2 species and suggest that vigilance toward dominant meadow voles magnifies the risk experienced by red-backed voles in open patches. Investigators assessing foraging behavior between “safe” and “risky” patches might misinterpret the competitive effect as predation risk unless they 1st account for competition among foraging individuals.",https://doi.org/10.1644/12-mamm-a-304.1,0
273,Global Warming Could Magnify Insect-Driven Apparent Competition Between Native and Introduced Host Plants in Sub-Antarctic Islands,"Pristine sub-Antarctic islands terrestrial ecosystems, including many endemic species, are highly threatened by human-induced cosmopolitan plant invasion. We propose that native plant suppression could be further facilitated by the subsequent invasion by generalist pest species that could exacerbate their competitive exclusion through the process of apparent competition. By comparing the biological parameters of an invasive aphid species, Myzus ascalonicus, on one native (Acaena magellanica) and one invasive (Senecio vulgaris) plant species, we showed that survival and fecundity were higher and development time lower on the native plant species than on the invasive one. Moreover, comparing the effect of a temperature increase on the population dynamics of M. ascalonicus on the two plants, we showed that the relative profitability of the native species is further amplified by warming. Hence, while pest population doubling time is 28% higher on the invasive plant under current temperature, it would become 40% higher with an increase in temperature of 3°C. Consequently, our findings demonstrate that global warming could exacerbate competitive exclusion of native plants by invasive plants in sub-Antarctic islands by its indirect effect on the apparent competition mediated by generalist phytophagous pests.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvab122,0
274,"Aggression, Combat, and Apparent Burrow Competition in Hatchling and Juvenile Gopher Tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus)","Adult North American tortoises (Gopherus spp.) engage in aggressive interactions with conspecifics when competing for mates and burrows. However, aggressive interactions have not been widely reported in hatchling and juvenile tortoises. We describe aggressive interactions between wild hatchling and juvenile gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) based on video recordings collected at tortoise burrows. Immature tortoises usually inhabited burrows alone but occasionally shared them. Presence of multiple individuals inside burrows hindered tortoise movements in burrows. Hatchlings or juveniles exhibited overt aggression toward similar aged/sized conspecifics in at least 6 of 13 (46%) encounters, and cameras may have failed to detect aggression occurring inside burrows. Hatchlings and juveniles also exhibited aggressive responses to foreign objects that were similar in appearance to small tortoises. Aggressive behaviors resembled those of adults and included repeated ramming, pushing, biting, and flipping. Young tortoises may respond aggressively to conspecifics at burrows because the presence of additional individuals constrains thermoregulatory and antipredator movements within these important microhabitats. Social interactions appear to play a greater role in the ecology of hatchling and juvenile gopher tortoises than previously recognized.",https://doi.org/10.2744/ccb-1181.1,0
275,"GROWTH AND OVERPOPULATION OF YELLOW PERCH AND THE APPARENT EFFECT OF INCREASED COMPETITION ON BROOK TROUT IN LONG LAKE, HALIFAX COUNTY, NOVA SCOTIA","A fish survey was conducted on Long Lake, Woodens River, Halifax County, Nova Scotia during May 2005. A total of 2711 yellow perch were captured over a twelve day period and were the most abundant fish. Fifty-eight yellow perch were sampled for length, weight, scales, and sex. Total length of yellow perch ranged from 81mm to 276 mm with a mean of 133mm. Ages determined from scale analysis ranged from 2 to 13 years but 95% were younger than 8 years of age. Age at maturity was 2 years. The Von Bertalanffy growth relationship for yellow perch described slow growth and suggested stunting which is consistent in crowded populations. Increased abundance of yellow perch and reduced abundance of brook trout has been reported by anglers in the Woodens River system and was evident from our catches. The apparent effect of increased, intraguild competition on the brook trout population is discussed.Keywords: yellow perch, brook trout, overpopulation, stunting, intraguild competition.",https://doi.org/10.15273/pnsis.v47i1.3379,0
276,Refuge-mediated apparent competition in a tallgrass prairie?,"The refuge-mediated apparent competition hypothesis (RMACH) posits that a plant species can indirectly reduce growth of competitors, and thus invade, by providing refuge for herbivores of more palatable surrounding plants. If the RMACH applies to Lespedeza cuneata, an invasive legume with dense, chemically defended foliage, I predict (a) more arthropods where the invasive is present, indicating that it provides more suitable habitat, (b) greater herbivory on plants surrounding the invasive than on the invasive itself, indicating it is not a food source, and (c) reduced herbivory on neighboring plants where the invasive has been removed. Removal of L. cuneata from experimental plots produced no overall effect on arthropod abundance; however, Japanese Beetles, a devastating invasive, were twice as abundant in plots with L. cuneata, indicating that Japanese Beetles prefer plots with L. cuneata (prediction a). L. cuneata removal did not significantly affect percent herbivory of potted native plants (“phytometers”) placed in plots to evaluate herbivory, however, L. cuneata phytometers had significantly higher total herbivory than native phytometers. These herbivory analyses do not support predictions (b) and (c): L. cuneata had higher herbivory than native species and there was no effect of L. cuneata removal on herbivory of native species. L. cuneata phytometers were very immature when placed in field plots, potentially before developing chemical defenses to deter herbivores. L. cuneata and Japanese Beetles may interact to mutually facilitate their invasion, whether it is through refuge-mediated apparent competition or another mechanism of invasion.",https://doi.org/10.30707/etd2019.fowler.j,0
277,HERBIVORE-MEDIATED APPARENT COMPETITION BETWEEN TWO,"Indirect negative interactions between prey species that share a predator, referred to as apparent competition, have been modeled extensively. However, experimental studies examining the importance of apparent competition in the field are sparse, especially in plant-herbivore systems. In this study, I examined the role of a beetle herbivore, Ery- nephala maritima, in mediating the indirect effects of an abundant host plant, Salicornia europaea, on a less common host species, Atriplex patula var. hastata, in New England salt marshes. To examine these relationships, I manipulated plant density (plants with vs. without neighbors) and composition nonspecificc neighbors vs. Salicornia neighbors) sur- rounding focal Atriplex plants, as well as the presence or absence of herbivores in a field experiment. Densities of both beetle eggs and larvae were significantly greater in plots with Salicornia, suggesting that its presence increases patch location or selection by her- bivores. Higher insect densities resulted in significantly higher levels of herbivore damage to Atriplex within Salicornia-addition plots compared with high- and low-density Atriplex plots. Thus the identity, and not just density, of neighboring plants is important in deter- mining levels of herbivory. Increased herbivore damage in Salicornia-addition plots resulted in a concomitant decrease in Atriplex survival and reproductive output. Furthermore, the negative effect of Salicornia on Atriplex survival and fruit production only occurred in the presence of herbivores, indicating that competitive effects are indirect rather than direct. Thus, Salicornia has a strong apparent competitive effect on Atriplex. Cross-site surveys suggested that the pattern of increased herbivore damage to Atriplex associated with in- creases in local Salicornia density is common and widespread. Overall, the results suggest that the apparent competitive effect of Salicornia is likely a major determinant of patterns of Atriplex abundance both between habitat patches and across marsh zones.",,0
278,Predator-mediated apparent competition persists in a rapidly changing Subarctic ecosystem,"The Alternative Prey Hypothesis (APH) states that predators switch to relatively more abundant prey when their main prey is scarce. In the High Arctic, lemming population cycles indirectly affect predation risk on alternative prey such as shorebird nests as they share a main predator, the arctic fox. In this study, we examined the indirect effects of arvicoline rodent cycles on alternative prey in the Subarctic where arctic and red fox coexist as predators of primary (lemmings, voles) and alternative prey (shorebird nests). Using 10 years of field data, our results indicate that interannual variation in daily nest survival of Dunlin was best explained by an interactive effect of arvicoline rodent abundance and arctic fox (not red fox) abundance. During high rodent years, shorebird nest survival appeared to be buffered from variation in arctic fox abundance but when rodents were absent, nest survival declined. We found no relationship between shorebird nest survival and red fox abundance despite red foxes being found in much higher abundance in the study area. Our results indicate that despite the presence of other predators and multiple primary prey species, predator-mediated interactions common to High Arctic sites, still hold true for the Subarctic in regards to the arctic fox, arvicoline rodents and shorebirds.",https://doi.org/10.22541/au.167751581.19158082/v1,0
279,Winter tick sharing between ungulates in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and implications for apparent competition,"Abstract Host species heterogeneity can drive parasite dynamics through variation in host competency as well as host abundance. We explored how elk ( Cervus canadensis ) with apparent subclinical infestations of winter tick ( Dermacentor albipictus ) may be a cryptic reservoir and drive winter tick dynamics, impacting moose ( Alces alces ) populations. We found that winter tick infestation loads did not vary remarkably between both host species and winter ticks sourced from elk and moose produced similar numbers of larvae which activated within 5 days of each other. We also found similar larval densities in habitats predominately used by elk, moose, and both host species. Our analysis of 2793 informative single‐nucleotide polymorphisms showed genetic differentiation among tick populations that were only ~75 km apart, but fewer differences among ticks from elk or moose in the same locality, suggesting sharing of winter ticks across host species. Despite the clinical signs of high winter tick infestations being most apparent on moose, elk may be critical drivers of winter tick population dynamics and indirectly compete with moose in areas where they outnumber moose populations, a common characteristic of ungulate communities in western North America. Management interventions aimed at addressing winter tick issues on moose may wish to consider the movement patterns and abundance of cryptic reservoirs like elk.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.70129,0

281,Data from: Density-dependent indirect effects: apparent mutualism and apparent competition coexist in a two-prey system,"A predator consuming multiple prey species usually causes indirect effects. Apparent mutualism results when multiple prey species reduce predation risk for each other by altering a predator’s functional response. Short-term apparent competition occurs when multiple prey species increase predation risks for each other through the numerical response, i.e. increasing the predator’s birth rate, or aggregative response, i.e. attracting a higher density of predators. Our objectives in this study were to determine the aggregative response and 2-prey functional response of a predator and to examine indirect effects over a range of prey densities. We used the clam Macoma balthica and juvenile blue crabs Callinectes sapidus as prey for adult blue crabs. In laboratory experiments, we determined the single-prey functional responses of the crabs to each prey species and the 2-prey functional response. We combined the 2-prey functional response with the known blue crab aggregative response to clams to estimate field predation rates. Our model predicts that at low prey densities, clams and juvenile blue crabs exhibit apparent mutual- ism, whereas at high clam densities, this relation switches to short-term apparent competition. These unexpected results highlight the need to incorporate multiple aspects of predation at multiple scales when considering indirect effects.",https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12780455,0
282,Faculty Opinions recommendation of Apparent competition can compromise the safety of highly specific biocontrol agents.,"Despite current concern about the safety of biological control of weeds, assessing the indirect impacts of introduced agents is not common practice. Using 17 replicate food webs, we demonstrate that the use of a highly host-plant specific weed biocontrol agent, recently introduced into Australia, is associated with declines of local insect communities. The agent shares natural enemies (predators and parasitoids) with seed herbivore species from native plants, so apparent competition is the most likely cause for these losses. Both species richness and abundance in insect communities (seed herbivores and their parasitoids) were negatively correlated with the abundance of the biocontrol agent. Local losses of up to 11 species (dipteran seed herbivores and parasitoids) took place as the biocontrol agent abundance increased. Ineffective biocontrol agents that remain highly abundant in the community are most likely to have persistent, indirect negative effects. Our findings suggest that more investment is required in pre-release studies on the effectiveness of biocontrol agents, as well as in post-release studies assessing indirect impacts, to avoid or minimize the release of potentially damaging species.

283,How apparent competition and predator responses led to the decline of Arctic ground squirrels in the boreal forests of the southwest Yukon,"Throughout much of North America’s boreal forest, the cyclical fluctuations of snowshoe hare populations (Lepus americanus) may cause other herbivores to become entrained in similar cycles. Alternating apparent competition and indirect mutualism via prey switching are the mechanisms behind this interaction. Our purpose is to document a change in the role of indirect interactions between sympatric populations of hares and arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii plesius), and to emphasize the influence of predation for controlling ground squirrel numbers. We used mark-recapture to estimate the population densities of both species over a 25-year period that covered two snowshoe hare cycles. We analysed the strength of association between snowshoe hare and ground squirrel numbers and changes in the seasonal and annual population growth rates of ground squirrels over time. A hyperbolic curve best describes the per capita rate of increase of ground squirrels relative to their population size, with a single stable equilibrium and a lower critical threshold below which populations drift to extinction. The crossing of this unstable boundary resulted in the subsequent uncoupling of ground squirrel and hare populations following the decline phase of their cycles in 1998. The implications are that this sustained Type II predator response led to the local extinction of ground squirrels. Arctic ground squirrels may also have exhibited an Allee effect caused by the disruption of social signalling of approaching predators when few individuals are left in a colony.",https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.1923v1,0

285,"Faculty Opinions recommendation of Do rabbits eat voles? Apparent competition, habitat heterogeneity and large-scale coexistence under mink predation.","Habitat heterogeneity is predicted to profoundly influence the dynamics of indirect interspecific interactions; however, despite potentially significant consequences for multi-species persistence, this remains almost completely unexplored in large-scale natural landscapes. Moreover, how spatial habitat heterogeneity affects the persistence of interacting invasive and native species is also poorly understood. Here we show how the persistence of a native prey (water vole, Arvicola terrestris) is determined by the spatial distribution of an invasive prey (European rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus) and directly infer how this is defined by the mobility of a shared invasive predator (American mink, Neovison vison). This study uniquely demonstrates that variation in habitat connectivity in large-scale natural landscapes creates spatial asynchrony, enabling coexistence between apparent competitive native and invasive species. These findings highlight that unexpected interactions may be involved in species declines, and also that in such cases habitat heterogeneity should be considered in wildlife management decisions.

Lucero Department of Plant and Wildlife Sciences, BYU Master of Science The effect of shared enemies between invasive and native species has been argued to facilitate biological invasions (i.e., the apparent competition hypothesis or ACH). This study investigated a previously untested possibility: whether granivorous small mammals facilitate cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) invasion by driving food-mediated apparent competition between cheatgrass and native grasses. Specifically, we tested three predictions that must be true if such apparent competition occurs. First, cheatgrass invasion augments total seeds available to granivorous small mammals. Second, density of granivorous small mammals increases in response to increased seed availability (simulated with experimental additions of cheatgrass seeds). Third, granivorous small mammals prefer seeds from native grasses over cheatgrass seeds. We tested these predictions in the Great Basin Desert of Utah, USA. Cheatgrass invasion augmented total yearly seed production. Granivorous small mammals preferred native seeds over cheatgrass seeds. However, neither abundance, richness, nor diversity of granivorous small mammals increased in response to experimental additions of cheatgrass seed. We therefore conclude that granivorous small mammals did not drive food-mediated apparent competition during the study period. The lack of support for the ACH in this study may suggest that the role of small mammal-driven apparent competition is either unimportant in the Great Basin, or that the appropriate indirect interactions between small mammals, cheatgrass, and native grasses have yet to be evaluated. Testing the third prediction required the separation of seeds from the soil matrix. We employed a chemical flotation methodology to recover target seeds from soil, and developed a novel method of decanting target material from the flotation solution. We compared the utility of the novel method to that of a traditional decantation method. Specifically, we compared effectiveness (the proportion of seeds recovered from a known sample), rapidity (the time required to decant that sample), efficiency (the number of seeds decanted per second), and recovery bias (the effect of relative density on seed recovery) between methods. Our proposed method was more effective, more rapid, more efficient, and less biased than the traditional method. Therefore, any future work relying on flotation to analyze seed banks should clearly describe how samples are decanted and should consider the proposed method as a potential means of enhancing the efficiency of chemical flotation.",,0

289,Resource competition in plant invasions: emerging patterns and research needs,"Invasions by alien plants provide a unique opportunity to examine competitive interactions among plants. While resource competition has long been regarded as a major mechanism responsible for successful invasions, given a well-known capacity for many invaders to become dominant and reduce plant diversity in the invaded communities, few studies have measured resource competition directly or have assessed its importance relatively to that of other mechanisms, at different stages of an invasion process. Here, we review evidence comparing the competitive ability of invasive species vs. that of co-occurring native plants, along a range of environmental gradients, showing that many invasive species have a superior competitive ability over native species, while invasive congeners are not necessarily competitively superior over native congeners, nor alien dominants are better competitors than native dominants. We discuss how the outcomes of competition depend on a number of factors, such as the heterogeneous distribution of resources, the stage of the invasion process, as well as phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary adaptation, which may result in increased or decreased competitive ability in both invasive and native species. Competitive advantages of invasive species over natives are often transient and only important at the early stages of an invasion process. It remains unclear how important resource competition is relative to other mechanisms (competition avoidance via phenological differences, niche differentiation in space associated with phylogenetic distance, recruitment and dispersal limitation, indirect competition, and allelopathy). We then identify the conceptual and methodological issues characterizing competition studies in plant invasions, and we discuss future research needs, including examinations of resource competition dynamics and of the impact of global environmental changes on competitive interactions between invasive and native species.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2014.00501,0

(2) Experiments were performed with (a) bahiagrass, Paspalum notatum, grown in soil treated with gallic acid and hydroquinone, putative inhibitors produced by Polygonella myriophylla and (b) tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum, grown in soils from under and around black walnut, Juglans nigra. (3) Phytotoxicity decreased as plant density increased. This was attributed to plant 'dilution' of phytotoxins, i.e. the sharing of the available phytotoxin among many plants at high densities such that each received a small sub-lethal dose. (4) Phytotoxins caused characteristic deviations from expected yield-density relationships. Low to moderate phytotoxin concentrations caused a decrease in the slope of the log yield-log density relationship. Contrary to the expected consequences of increased density and resource competition, the presence of high phytotoxin concentrations may cause a reversal in the slope of predicted log yield-log density relationships at low plant densities, such that maximum individual plant weight occurs at an intermediate density. (5) Demonstration of either decreasing phytotoxicity with increasing plant density or a reversal in slope of the predicted log yield-log density relationship is proposed as an indication of the presence of toxic substances in soil.

291,Herbivory and plant resource competition: a review of two interacting interactions,"This review discusses the prevalence and potential for interactive effects between herbivory and competition on plant growth and biomass, and it is apparent that such effects typically arise when there is a mismatch between the spatial scale of herbivore behaviour (food or patch choice) and the spatial heterogeneity of the plant community. Historically, such interactive effects have been examined using two approaches. Studies using the first approach have excluded plant neighbors and herbivores in a factorial experiment, and scored effects on plant biomass. Studies using the second approach have observed herbivore abundance or herbivory on plants with or without plant neighbors, and have identified a large number of mechanisms underlying such interactive effects. The two types of studies have produced somewhat conflicting results, where interactive effects have been commonly observed in studies using the second approach and only rarely in studies using the first approach. This is most likely a consequence of a biased choice of study systems, where studies using the first approach have primarily studied mammalian herbivory while studies using the second approach have been more focussed on insect herbivory. Moreover, studies using the first approach have typically been very small‐scale manipulations and this probably precludes most possible interactive effects in systems with mammalian herbivory. This points to the fact that studies examining interactive effects of herbivory and plant competition should more carefully consider the behaviour and life history of herbivores included in the study prior to the design of removal experiments.",https://doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12568.x,0

Stachowicz*, Jarrett E. Byrnes Section of Evolution and Ecology and Center for Population Biology, University of California at Davis, Davis, California 95616, USA *Email: jjstachowicz@ucdavis.edu ABSTRACT: Experimental manipulations and observational surveys often produce conflicting conclusions regarding the effects of native species diversity on community susceptibility to invasion. Both provide useful pieces of information, but typically each asks fundamentally different questions. Surveys tell us that locations with species-rich native communities are characterized by conditions that promote exotic species richness, whereas experiments tell us that, within a location, the loss of resident species increases the likelihood of the establishment of new species. In the present study, we apply observational data to a study of the consequences of species loss for invasion in order to assess the generality across scales and the relative importance of experimental results. We begin by using long-term recruitment data to explore how small-scale mechanisms of biotic resistance could operate on a landscape scale. We find that individual species have complementary seasonal recruitment patterns such that more diverse communities might be able to more consistently fill space that opens throughout the season, leading to reduced invasion success. However, field surveys of native and invader richness show that the slope of the relationship between native and invader diversity changes with the availability of resources (space) and the presence of habitat-forming foundation species. In these systems, biotic resistance appears to be important only when resources are scarce and foundation species are rare. Thus, we conclude that biotic resistance, as identified in experiments, is a consistent effect of diversity that can be explained mechanistically at even a landscape scale, but that it plays a dominant role only when total diversity is constrained by resource limitation.

293,"Differential Dispersal, Local Resource Competition, and Sex Ratio Variation in Birds","Local resource competition arising through differential natal dispersal of daughters and sons may be an overlooked selection pressure on progeny sex ratio variation in birds. Passerines have predominantly daughter-biased natal dispersal; anseriforms have predominantly son-biased natal dispersal. Therefore, the local resource competition hypothesis predicts that passerines will have daughter-biased sex ratios and anseriforms will have son-biased sex ratios. These predictions are supported by observations of between-order variation in progeny sex ratios. Across latitude and within season, variation in progeny sex ratios of given species may also reflect selection through local resource competition arising in association with variation in relative son and daughter philopatry.",https://doi.org/10.1086/285472,0
294,Ungulate Grazing in Sagebrush Grassland: Mechanisms of Resource Competition,"In many areas of western North America, populations of Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus canadensis) avoid snow at high elevations during winter by migrating to sagebrush grassland communities in mountain valleys, communities that are used by cattle in the spring and early summer. As a result of these patterns of habitat use, the impact of elk on forage supplies for cattle has emerged as an important issue in range and wildlife management throughout the West. We examined effects of variation in population density of elk on the availability and use of forage resources by cattle in a randomized complete block experiment conducted in sagebrush grassland during four years. We manipulated elk numbers to achieve four levels of population density (0, 9, 15, and 31 elk/km 2 ), replicated each level three times, and observed responses of vegetation and cattle to these manipulations. At high densities (31 animals/km 2 ), elk annually removed 57% of the standing crop of dead perennial grass and 12% of the total annual production of live perennial grass. Standing crops of dead perennial grass in early spring declined in direct proportion to increasing elk density (linear effect F 1,6 = 10.0, P = 0.02) from a mean of 8.7 g/m 2 in the controls (0 elk/km 2 ) to 3.3 g/m 2 in the high density (31 elk/km 2 ) treatment. Early spring standing crops of live perennial grass also declined as elk population density increased, but these trends only approached significance (linear effect F 1.6 = 3.4, P = 0.12). Effects of elk grazing on herbaceous aboveground net primary production were not significant (minimum P &gt; 0.38), but the total supply of herbaceous dry matter available to cattle (standing dead + primary production) declined in linear relation to elk density (linear effect F 1.6 = 7.7, P = 0.03). Canopy cover of shrubs was least and canopy cover of grass was greatest at intermediate levels of elk density (quadratic effect F 1.6 = 9.4, P = 0.03). We found weak enhancing effects of elk populations on nutritional quality of spring forage. Elk grazing caused linear increases in the digestibility (F 1.6 = 5.0, P. = 0.07) and nitrogen content (F 1.6 = 15.1, P = 0.008) of perennial grass available to cattle. Nitrogen content of cattle diets increased in the moderately grazed treatments (control vs. 15 elk/km 2 , F 1.6 = 4.3, P = 0.06), but dietary digestibility and fiber content did not change significantly with treatment. Daily forage intake by cattle (kilograms of dry matter per cow per day) declined in direct relation to elk density (F 1.6 = 5.2, P = 0.06), primarily as a result of reductions in intake of standing dead grass. Consequently, cattle daily intake of digestible energy (linear effect F 1.6 = 5.1, P = 0.06) and nitrogen (control vs. others F 1.6 = 5.4, P = 0.06) declined as elk population density increased. The mechanism responsible for this decline was a Type II functional response of cattle to forage biomass. We conclude that effects of elk on cattle represent a composite of facilitative and competitive effects. When forage production is low and cattle density is high, competition is a much stronger force than facilitation.",https://doi.org/10.2307/2269564,0
295,Effects of resource competition and herbivory on plant performance along a natural productivity gradient,"Summary 1 The effects of resource competition and herbivory on a target species, Triglochin maritima , were studied along a productivity gradient of vegetation biomass in a temperate salt marsh. 2 Transplants were used to measure the impact of grazing, competition and soil fertility over two growing seasons. Three parts of the marsh were selected to represent different successional stages; Triglochin reached local dominance at intermediate biomass of salt‐marsh vegetation. At each stage, three competition treatments (full plant competition, root competition only, and no competition) and three grazing treatments (full grazing, no grazing on Triglochin , and no grazing on Triglochin or neighbours) were applied to both seedlings and mature plants. 3 Competition and herbivory reduced biomass and flowering of Triglochin . The impact of grazing was strongest at the stage with the lowest biomass, while both herbivory and competition had a significant impact at the stage with the highest biomass. When plants were protected from direct herbivory, competition operated at all three successional stages. 4 Grazing reduced light competition when vegetation biomass was low or intermediate, but at high biomass there was competition for light even when grazing occurred. Herbivore exclusion increased the effects of plant competition. Except at low biomass, the negative impact of plant competition on Triglochin performance was greater than the positive effect of not being grazed. 5 Grazing played a minor role in seedling survival and establishment which were largely controlled by competitive and facilitative effects. 6 Once established, the persistence of Triglochin will be determined largely by grazing. Intense grazing in the younger marsh and increasing competition for light in the older marsh will restrict the distribution to sites with intermediate biomass.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2000.00450.x,0
296,Competition for nutrients and light: testing advances in resource competition with a natural phytoplankton community,"A key challenge in ecology is to understand how nutrients and light affect the biodiversity and community structure of phytoplankton and plant communities. According to resource competition models, ratios of limiting nutrients are major determinants of species composition. At high nutrient levels, however, species interactions may shift to competition for light, which might make nutrient ratios less relevant. The ""nutrient-load hypothesis"" merges these two perspectives, by extending the classic model of competition for two nutrients to include competition for light. Here, we test five key predictions of the nutrient-load hypothesis using multispecies competition experiments. A marine phytoplankton community sampled from the North Sea was inoculated in laboratory chemostats provided with different nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loads to induce either single resource limitation or co-limitation of N, P, and light. Four of the five predictions were validated by the experiments. In particular, different resource limitations favored the dominance of different species. Increasing nutrient loads caused changes in phytoplankton species composition, even if the N:P ratio of the nutrient loads remained constant, by shifting the species interactions from competition for nutrients to competition for light. In all treatments, small species became dominant whereas larger species were competitively excluded, supporting the common view that small cell size provides a competitive advantage under resource-limited conditions. Contrary to expectation, all treatments led to coexistence of diatoms, cyanobacteria and green algae, resulting in a higher diversity of species than predicted by theory. Because the coexisting species comprised three phyla with different photosynthetic pigments, we speculate that niche differentiation in the light spectrum might play a role. Our results show that mechanistic resource competition models that integrate nutrient-based and light-based approaches provide an important step forward to understand and predict how changing nutrient loads affect community composition.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2187,0
297,Aggressive Interactions and Resource Competition in Relation to Species Displacement Among Crayfish of the Genus Orconectes,"Aggressive interactions and competition for shelter were studied in simplified laboratory environments among the crayfish Orconectes virilis, O. propinquus, and O. rusticus. O. rusticus was clearly superior to O. virilis, with O. propinquus generally intermediate. These results are consistent with ongoing displacements in northern Wisconsin. However, in another part of the study involving competition for preferred substrate, little displacement occurred even at high densities; caution is therefore suggested in assessing the importance of aggressive interactions to species displacements.",https://doi.org/10.2307/1548090,0
298,Resource competition of herbivorous zooplankton: a review of approaches and perspectives,"Resource competition is an indirect interaction, affecting the competitors via the exploitation of common food sources. The traditional phenomenological view of competition is presently being overcome by mechanistic concepts, thus opening the way to take advantage of knowledge of zooplankton ecophysiology, life histories, and feeding modes. Several hypotheses of zooplankton competition have been proposed, some of them entirely based on assumptions about resource use, some of them involving other than merely resource related aspects. The concepts of threshold food concentrations, of resource partitioning due to different feeding modes, and of the effects of resource variance are regarded to be the most promising approaches. Research along these lines is encouraged",https://doi.org/10.1127/archiv-hydrobiol/118/1990/1,0
299,Resource competition between sympatric sibling rotifer species,"Mechanisms underlying competitive interactions are important in understanding the structure of planktonic communities, particularly the coexistence of similar species. Here we present experimental results of exploitative competition among three sympatric sibling species of the Brachionus plicatilis complex for two differently‐sized species of food microalgae. These three rotifer species are to be found in seasonal succession in brackish ponds on the Spanish Mediterranean coast; they can, however, co‐occur for long periods. The functional and numerical responses of the three Brachionus species to both food microalgae, although similar, differed. Neither rotifer population growth nor grazing rates showed a clear positive correlation between rotifer and alga sizes. Tilman's models were applied to these results in order to predict the outcome of competition in two rotifer, two resources systems. For testing predictions and addressing the possibility of rotifer coexistence, we performed pairwise competition experiments in semicontinuous cultures, which introduces periodic disturbance as an additional factor. Results confirmed the pattern expected from Tilman's models regarding the competitive superiority of each rotifer species, when food composition was biased toward one of the two resources. This shows the relevance of the food threshold concept to predict the superior competitor. However, coexistence of rotifers was found in conditions in which Tilman's models had predicted an unstable equilibrium, with the winning species depending on the initial conditions. We hypothesize that variance in food availability mediated coexistence. Our results suggest that both food partitioning and disturbance are important in explaining the coexistence of these sibling species in nature.",https://doi.org/10.4319/lo.2001.46.6.1511,0
300,Resource Competition During Seasonal Succession Toward Dominance by Cyanobacteria,"An annual replacement of eucaryotic algae by nostocalean cyanobacteria was studied by monitoring the algal and zooplankton communities as well as various nutrient components during three growing seasons in Pleasant Pond, Minnesota. Short—term factorial experiments consisting of nitrogen and phosphorus enrichments and macrograzer removal were performed, and algal population growth was observed to determine whether nitrogen, phosphorus, or both were potentially limiting to different phytoplankton taxa. The algal taxa that were consumed by the dominant grazer, Daphnia pulex, were also determined. Competition for nitrogen together with grazing on the inferior competitors occurred. Several other potential mechanisms–a changing nitrogen—to—phosphorus supply ratio, increasing grazing pressure, and competition for silicon–did not appear to be important. Nitrogen was more limiting than phosphorus. At least some nonheterocystous species were nitrogen limited in every experiment. During the transition to dominance by Nostocales, Nostocales did not usually respond to nitrogen additions, whereas many other species did. This taxonomic difference in nutrient limitation suggests that some of the species unable to produce heterocysts were being outcompeted for nitrogen. Daphnia grazers consumed Anabaena flos—aquae, Fragilaria sp., gelatinous greens, pennate diatoms, and Scenedesmus spp. Algal responses to added nitrogen and to grazers were often interdependent. A behavioral indirect effect via the grazers' functional response could explain this dependence.",https://doi.org/10.2307/1938429,0
301,Resource competition in a discrete environment: Why are plankton distributions paradoxical?,"For nearly all natural waters, planktonic organisms will be distributed discretely in the fluid mechanical sense. This means that the dynamics of planktonic ecosystems occur among discrete particles, not continuous scalar fields. This idea was first suggested by Hurlburt (1990) as an explanation for the paradox of the plankton. However, the discrete nature of organism distributions has many important implications for the interpretation and modeling of planktonic ecosystems. In particular, mass conservation relationship approaches to the modeling of planktonic populations (i.e., resource competititon and its result, competitive exclusion) will not be valid for all natural conditions. A microscale model of competition among individual phytoplankton cells was used to investigate the role of discreteness on phytoplankton competitition for a single, limiting nutrient substrate. This scaling analysis demonstrates that rates of competitition should increase with cellular abundance and phytoplankton size. For a typical eutrophic planktonic ecosystem (relatively large cell abundances and cell sizes), resource competitition among individual phytoplankters appears to be likely. However, for oligotrophic conditions (low cell abundances and small cells), rates of competitive displacement should be greatly reduced. The microscale competition model does not predict that the final outcome of competition will differ from resource competition theory when evaluated over thousands of division cycles. However the time required for this outcome to occur may be so long that other processes, such as episodic nutrient inputs, imposed diel cycles, and specialization of the grazer assemblage, are likely to have a dominant role in determining the species composition of an oligotrophic phytoplankton community. This seeming violation of the principle of competitive exclusion occurs because nutrient competition in oligotrophic environments is governed by interactions among discrete individuals rather than entire populations. Discreteness in plankton distributions also creates an ecological subgrid scale (SGS) problem that must be solved as part of most mathematical descriptions of plankton population dynamics. Approaches towards solution of the ecological SGS problem are suggested; however, a great deal of theoretical and experimental work remains.",https://doi.org/10.4319/lo.1998.43.6.1133,0
302,Intraspecific competition drives increased resource use diversity within a natural population,"Resource competition is thought to play a major role in driving evolutionary diversification. For instance, in ecological character displacement, coexisting species evolve to use different resources, reducing the effects of interspecific competition. It is thought that a similar diversifying effect might occur in response to competition among members of a single species. Individuals may mitigate the effects of intraspecific competition by switching to use alternative resources not used by conspecific competitors. This diversification is the driving force in some models of sympatric speciation, but has not been demonstrated in natural populations. Here, we present experimental evidence confirming that competition drives ecological diversification within natural populations. We manipulated population density of three-spine sticklebacks ( Gasterosteus aculeatus ) in enclosures in a natural lake. Increased population density led to reduced prey availability, causing individuals to add alternative prey types to their diet. Since phenotypically different individuals added different alternative prey, diet variation among individuals increased relative to low-density control enclosures. Competition also increased the diet–morphology correlations, so that the frequency-dependent interactions were stronger in high competition. These results not only confirm that resource competition promotes niche variation within populations, but also show that this increased diversity can arise via behavioural plasticity alone, without the evolutionary changes commonly assumed by theory.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2006.0198,0
303,Flow-mediated resource competition in the suspension feeding gorgonian Plexaura homomalla (Esper),"To assess the importance of resource competition in suspension feeders, growth of a common Caribbean gorgonian Plexaura homomalla (Esper) was examined with and without conspecifics. Five small branch sections (i.e., transplants) from a single parent colony were set next to each other in a linear array on a cement flat and maintained in situ in an area characterized by oscillating flow. After one year, we found a systematic decrease in growth rate from the outer to the middle position on these flats, a pattern consistent with expectations of flow-mediated competition for water-borne resources. Competition for water-borne resources is seldom considered among reef taxa, but such competition can play an important role in affecting both intra- and interspecific interactions.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0022-0981(97)00015-4,0
304,Resource competition and interactive segregation between sympatric whitefish morphs,"Two whitefish morphs have been identified in lakes in northern Norway from a bimodal distribution of gill raker numbers: a sparsely- and a densely-rakered. Habitat choice and feeding ecology of whitefish were studied in five lakes with the two morphs living in sympatry, and in five lakes harbouring only the sparsely-rakered morph. In sympatry, the two whitefish morphs exhibited a strict niche segregation, the sparsely-rakered morph mainly residing in the littoral zone feeding on zoobenthos, whereas the densely-rakered morph predominantly fed on zooplankton and dominated in the pelagic zone. In allopatry, however, the densely-rakered morph exhibited a larger niche width, utilising both the benthic and pelagic habitats and having a diet that included both zoobenthos and zooplankton. Thus, in sympatry with densely-rakered whitefish, the sparsely-rakered morph appears to be relegated from the pelagic zone, resulting in an interactive segregation due to resource competition between the two morphs.",,0
305,"BIOME3: An equilibrium terrestrial biosphere model based on ecophysiological constraints, resource availability, and competition among plant functional types","The equilibrium terrestrial biosphere model BIOME3 simulates vegetation distribution and biogeochemistry, and couples vegetation distribution directly to biogeochemistry. Model inputs consist of latitude, soil texture class, and monthly climate (temperature, precipitation, and sunshine) data on a 0.5° grid. Ecophysiological constraints determine which plant functional types (PFTs) may potentially occur. A coupled carbon and water flux model is then used to calculate, for each PFT, the leaf area index (LAI) that maximizes net primary production (NPP), subject to the constraint that NPP must be sufficient to maintain this LAI. Competition between PFTs is simulated by using the optimal NPP of each PFT as an index of competitiveness, with additional rules to approximate the dynamic equilibrium between natural disturbance and succession driven by light competition. Model output consists of a quantitative vegetation state description in terms of the dominant PFT, secondary PFTs present, and the total LAI and NPP for the ecosystem. Canopy conductance is treated as a function of the calculated optimal photosynthetic rate and water stress. Regional evapotranspiration is calculated as a function of canopy conductance, equilibrium evapotranspiration rate, and soil moisture using a simple planetary boundary layer parameterization. This scheme results in a two‐way coupling of the carbon and water fluxes through canopy conductance, allowing simulation of the response of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and leaf area to environmental factors including atmospheric CO 2 . Comparison with the mapped distribution of global vegetation shows that the model successfully reproduces the broad‐scale patterns in potential natural vegetation distribution. Comparison with NPP measurements, and with an FPAR (fractional absorbed photosynthetically active radiation) climatology based on remotely sensed greenness measurements, provides further checks on the model's internal logic. The model is envisaged as a tool for integrated analysis of the impacts of changes in climate and CO 2 on ecosystem structure and function.",https://doi.org/10.1029/96gb02344,0
306,Plant Competition and Resource Availability in Response to Disturbance and Fertilization,"Variation in the intensities of above— and belowground competition is proposed to underlie changes in community structure associated with variable fertility and disturbance. Here we report measurements of light, soil nitrogen, and above— and belowground competition in vegetation that had received four combinations of fertilization and disturbance for 3 yr. Two levels of nitrogen addition (none and 17 g°m — 2 °yr — 1 ) and two of soil disturbance (non and annual tilling to remove all vegetation) were applied in a factorial design to 5 ° 5 m plots (10 replicated) in a 31—yr—old field in southeastern Minnesota. During the 3rd yr of the experiment, community standing crop, light penetration, and soil ammonium and nitrate concentrations were measured every 3—4 wk. Fertilization significantly increased productivity and tilling significantly decreased community biomass at the start of the growing season, indicating that the experimental treatments created variation in stress and disturbance. Transplants of Schizachyrium scoparium, a native perennial grass, were grown with no neighbors, or with the roots of neighbors, or with all neighbors in each combination of fertility and disturbance in order to examine competition intensity. In both undisturbed and tilled plots, belowground competition was the dominant interaction in unfertilized plots, whereas both below— and aboveground competition controlled growth in fertilized plots. The intensity of aboveground competition was greatest in plots with the lowest light penetration and declined significantly with increasing light supply. Similarly, belowground competition was most intense in plots with the lowest nitrogen availability and decreased significantly with increasing availability. The intensities of above— and belowground competition were significantly negatively correlated. The total (above— and belowground) intensity of competition did not vary with fertility, but was significantly reduced by disturbance. Similarly, the effect of neighbor mass on transplant growth was significantly reduced by disturbance.",https://doi.org/10.2307/1939319,0
307,"Desert locust outbreaks in the Sahel: resource competition, predation and ecological effects of pest control","Summary The desert locust Schistocerca gregaria has been considered a major pest since ancient times, as locust swarms holding millions of insects move throughout the Sahel, northern Africa, Middle East and southern Mediterranean countries. Most research has focused on the biology of the species and the development of strategies in locust control, but little is known about the place of locust pulses within food webs in which domestic herbivores and European long‐distance migratory birds are also involved. We evaluated the role of desert locust outbreaks in the food webs of the Sahelian region. We analysed the potential resource competition with domestic herbivores and the response of a generalist predator by assessing its diet and foraging behaviour in relation to the availability of locusts. Stable isotope analyses revealed that little trophic overlap exists between desert locusts that feed on trees and shrubs and nomadic livestock that feed on grasses in the Sahelian savanna grasslands. These results suggest low resource competition with the main human resources in regions with little agricultural development. In addition, during an outbreak that occurred in winter, desert locusts were consumed by resident and long‐distance migrant birds. This accounted for significant changes in the diet and foraging strategies of wintering generalist predators such as the black kite Milvus migrans . Synthesis and applications . Our results raise questions about the need for spraying locust swarms in areas where economic losses are scant and wintering populations of European trans‐Saharan migrant birds are high. A deeper insight into the ecological and economical role of these outbreaks is urgently needed, together with a reassessment of desert locust control in the Sahel.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01279.x,0
308,Simulating resource competition in multispecies agricultural plant communities,"Summary: Résumé: Zusammenfassung Agricultural systems that utilize reduced tillage, minimal inputs produced off‐farm, and/or intercropping are being developed worldwide. In these systems competition for resources among two or more plant species, including weeds, are important. A need exists for improved modelling capabilities of multispecies interactions so that these systems can be studied more quickly and efficiently. The Nitrogen, Tillage, Residue, Management (NTRM) model was expanded to simulate the concurrent development of several plant species growing together in a field‐sized agricultural plant community. Competitive interactions between component plant species were simulated by the addition of algorithms to partition average daily light flux density in a one‐dimensional, horizontally layered plant canopy and by expansion of a one‐dimensional root zone sub‐model to predict the simultaneous extraction of water and soil nitrogen by competing plant root systems. The expanded simulation model, known as NTRM‐MSC (−Multiple Species Competition), was calibrated and validated with data obtained from a field study investigating com ( Zea mays L.) and redroot pigweed ( Amaranthus retroflexus L.) competitive interactions. Preliminary model validation was performed using data from com/pigweed mixtures and monocultures receiving reduced irrigation inputs or no nitrogen fertilization. Results indicated that the NTRM‐MSC model shows promise for simulating canopy light interception in mixed and monoculture stands. The model also performed well (r 2 of 0.889 to 0.955) at predicting dry matter accumulation and leaf area development of both com and redroot pigweed growing in mixture and monoculture for irrigated, non‐irrigated, and for N‐fertilized and non‐fertilized conditions. Sensitivity analyses of several model parameters suggest that the NTRM‐MSC model may provide information on factors important in driving the competition between species in agroecosystems. Simulation de la compétition pour les ressources dans des communautés végétates agricoles multi‐spécifiques Des systèmes agricoles à base de travaux du sol réduits, de niveaux d'intrants minima ux, et/ou de cultures associées, sont développés dans e monde entier. Dans ces systèmes, la compétition pour les ressources entre deux ou de multiples espèces, végétales, y compris des mauvaises herbes, tient une place importante. Pour étudier ces systèmes plus rapidement et plus efficace‐ment, il faut augmenter la puissance des modèles d'interactions multispécifiques. Le modèle de gestion Azote‐Travail du sol‐Residus (NTRM) a étéélendu de manière à simuler le développe‐ment concurrentiel de plusieurs espèces végétales croissant ensemble au sein d'une com‐munauté végétale agricole de la taille d'un champ. Les interactions compétitives entre espèces végétales étaient simulées par 1'addition d'algorithmes de répartition du flux lumineux moyen quotidien dans un couvert organisé encouches horizontales et par extension d'un sousmodèle mono‐dimensionnel de zones racinaires pour prédire le prélèvement simultané d'eau et d'azote par des systèmes racinaires concurrents. Le modèle étendu, dénommé NTRM‐MSC (MSC pour compétition multispécifique), a été calibré et validé par une étude au champ des interactions compétitives entre le maïs ( Zea mays L.) et l'amaranthe réfléchie ( Amaranthus retroflexus L.). Une validation préliminaire du modèle a été obtenue à partir de cultures, pures ou mélangées, de maïs et d'amaranthes, sous irrigation réduite ou sans fertilisation azotée. Les résultats montrent l'intérêt du modèle NTRM‐MSC pour simuler l'interception de lumière par les couverts de cultures pures ou mélangées. Le modèle a aussi fourni des prédictions satisfaisantes ( r 2 de 0,889 à 0,955) de l'accumulation de matière sèche et de l'augmentation de surface foliaire du maïs et de l'amaranthe poussant en mélange et en cultures pures, en conditions irriguées ou non irriguées, avec ou sans fertilisation azotée. L'analyse de la sensibilité de plusieurs de ses paramètres suggère que le modèle NTRM‐MSC pourrait fournir des informations sur les facteurs importants dans la conduite de la compétition entre espèces dans les agroécosystèmes. Simulation der Konkurrenz um Wachstumsfaktoren in Agro‐Phytozönosen Weltweit werden landwirtschaftliche Produktionssysteme mit reduzierter Bodenbearbeitung, verringertem Input von Produktionsmitteln und Zwischenfruchtbau entwickelt. In diesen Systemen spielt die Konkurrenz der Pflanzenarten einschließlich der Unkräuter um die Wachstumsfaktoren eine große Rolle. Für ihre schnelle und umfassende Untersuchung sind gut entwickelte Modelle über die ökologischen Beziehungen zwischen mehreren Arten erforderlich. Ein Modell NTRM zum Stickstoff‐Bodenbearbeitung‐Rückstände‐Management wurde erweitert, um die gemeinsame Entwicklung mehrerer Pflanzenarten in feldgroßen Pflanzenbeständen simulieren zu können. Die Konkurrenzbeziehungen zwischen den einzelnen Arten wurden durch Algorithmen über den Anteil am durchschnittlichen täglichen Lichteinfall in einer eindimensionalen, horizontalen Vegetationsdecke und durch Erweiterung eines eindimensionalen Untermodells für die Wurzelzone simuliert, um die gleichzeitige Aufnahme von Wasser und Stickstoff durch konkurrierende Pflanzen‐ und Wurzelsysteme zu prognostizieren. Das für die Konkurrenz verschiedener Arten (MSC) erweiterte Simulationsmodell NTRM‐MSC wurde mit Daten aus Freilandsversuchen über die Konkurrenzbeziehungen zwischen Mais ( Zea mays L.) und Zurückgekrümmtem Amarant ( Amaranthus retroflexus L.) kalibriert und validiert. Für eine vorläufige Validierung des Modells wurden Daten aus Mais‐Amarant‐Misch‐ und ‐Reinbeständen eingesetzt, die weniger bewässert und nicht mit Stickstoff gedüngt worden waren. Anhand der Ergebnisse erwies sich das NTRM‐MSC‐Modell für die Simulation der Lichtaufnahme in Misch‐ und Reinbeständen als aussichtsreich. Auch die Prognose der Trockenmassebildung und der Blattflächenentwicklung bei beiden Arten in bewässerten und nicht bewässerten sowie N‐gedüngten und nicht gedüngten Beständen war gut ( r 2 von 0,889 bis 0,955). Sensitivitätstests für verschiedene Modellparameter lassen das NTRM‐MSC‐Modell für die Gewinnung von Informationen über wichtige Faktoren für die Bee‐influssung der Konkurrenz zwischen den Arten in Agro Phytozönosen brauchbar erscheinen.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.1993.tb01945.x,0
309,Separation of Allelopathy from Resource Competition Using Rice/Barnyardgrass Mixed-Cultures,"Plant-plant interference is the combined effect of allelopathy, resource competition, and many other factors. Separating allelopathy from resource competition is almost impossible in natural systems but it is important to evaluate the relative contribution of each of the two mechanisms on plant interference. Research on allelopathy in natural and cultivated plant communities has been hindered in the absence of a reliable method that can separate allelopathic effect from resource competition. In this paper, the interactions between allelopathic rice accession PI312777, non-allelopathic rice accession Lemont and barnyardgrass were explored respectively by using a target (rice)-neighbor (barnyardgrass) mixed-culture in hydroponic system. The relative competitive intensity (RCI), the relative neighbor effect (RNE) and the competitive ratio (CR) were used to quantify the intensity of competition between each of the two different potentially allelopathic rice accessions and barnyardgrass. Use of hydroponic culture system enabled us to exclude any uncontrolled factors that might operate in the soil and we were able to separate allelopathy from resource competition between each rice accession and barnyardgrass. The RCI and RNE values showed that the plant-plant interaction was positive (facilitation) for PI312777 but that was negative (competition) for Lemont and barnyardgrass in rice/barnyardgrass mixed-cultures. The CR values showed that one PI312777 plant was more competitive than 2 barnyardgrass plants. The allelopathic effects of PI312777 were much more intense than the resource competition in rice/barnyardgrass mixed cultures. The reverse was true for Lemont. These results demonstrate that the allelopathic effect of PI312777 was predominant in rice/barnyardgrass mixed-cultures. The most significant result of our study is the discovery of an experimental design, target-neighbor mixed-culture in combination with competition indices, can successfully separate allelopathic effects from competition.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0037201,0
310,"THE BURDEN OF CO-OCCUPANCY: INTRASPECIFIC RESOURCE COMPETITION AND SPACING PATTERNS IN AMERICAN MINK, MUSTELA VISON","Live-trapping and radiotracking of American mink (Mustela vison) on 24 km of the River Thames, United Kingdom, revealed range sizes (male: 6.8 km, female: 2.7 km), numbers of other mink found in the range of each male (0.98 males, 1.95 females) and each female (1.18 males, 0.32 females), and range overlaps between dyads of males (88.2%), a male and a female (male: 32.6%, female: 69.1%), and females (66.3%). We used these data to estimate the potential energetic burden of conspecifics on each other. As a monthly average, cohabiting males and other females take an estimated 30% and 9%, respectively, of the total energy consumption by mink within the range of each female. Similarly, cohabiting males and females consume an estimated 21% and 40%, respectively, of the energy in each male's range. Intraspecific resource depression may force both sexes, especially males, to maintain larger ranges. We suggest that, in the case of American mink, intraspecific prey-resource competition affects the range sizes of both sexes.",https://doi.org/10.1644/1545-1542(2003)084<1341:tbocir>2.0.co;2,0
311,Resource competition and community structure in aquatic micro-organisms: experimental studies of algae and bacteria along a gradient of organic carbon to inorganic phosphorus supply,"Two microbial communities were grown in chemostats receiving a low supply of inorganic Phosphorus (P) (10 μM) and different supplies of organic carbon (OC), ranging from 0 to 600 μM, either as glucose or a mixture of organic substrates. One community was a natural assemblage of lake plankton and the other was a model community composed of cultured organisms. As the supply ratio of OC to inorganic P increased, concentrations of dissolved OC increased, concentrations of dissolved P decreased and abundances of phototrophic algae decreased. Abundances of bacteria and phagotrophic organisms did not consistently change with the OC:P supply ratio. The model community was first established with a phototroph (Scenedesmus quadricauda) and bacteria; the steady states of this community were invasible by the mixotroph Ochromonas danica under all OC:P supply ratios used. When OC supply was high, both microbial communities persisted with higher concentrations of dissolved OC when mixed substrates, rather than glucose, were supplied. Otherwise, the effects of organic substrate composition appeared to be secondary to those of the OC:P supply ratio. These experiments confirm some elements of published theory on resource-based interactions among heterotrophic bacteria and phototrophic algae.",https://doi.org/10.1093/plankt/22.8.1591,0
312,Resource competition and plant traits: a response to Craine <i>et al</i>. 2005,"Summary Resource competition theory incorporates the mechanisms that underlie consumer–resource interactions and the trade‐offs that constrain these mechanisms. Contrary to assertions by Craine, the concept of R* as the measure of resource reduction and the predictor of resource competition has not changed since it was proposed more than two decades ago. Resource reduction, as summarized in R*, is readily observed. Soil concentrations of nitrate and water are decreased by plant uptake, and are lowered to different levels by different species. Tests have shown R* theory to correctly predict competitive outcomes for a variety of organisms and ecosystems. Consumer‐resource mechanisms are a building block for theories that incorporate other trade‐offs faced by plants, such as those between competitive ability and dispersal. Numerous plant traits interactively determine R* in a manner predictable from trait‐based resource competition theory. The same traits shown by comparative research to be associated with plant dominance in low‐nutrient habitats give lower R* values, greater predicted competitive ability and greater predicted abundances in nutrient‐limited habitats. Plant ecology needs closer links between analytical theory, observations and experiments. Simple verbal theories can generate novel ideas but the logical implications of such scenarios are best explored using the rigorous logic of mathematics. Predictions of theory can then be tested via experiments and comparative studies.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2007.01201.x,0
313,Predation as a factor mediating resource competition among rotifer sibling species,"The relevance of predation as a factor mediating the competitive interaction among ecologically very similar species is investigated by experimentally analyzing the effect of the copepod predator Diacyclops bicuspidatus odessanus on three sibling rotifer species belonging to the Brachionus plicatilis species complex. These rotifer species are similar in shape but show notable differences in body size. Predator and prey species coߚoccur in brackish waterbodies close to the Mediterranean coast of Spain. First, we characterized differential vulnerability of rotifers to predation. A consistent tendency of higher predation rates on smaller prey (i.e., smaller species and younger individuals) was observed. Analysis of predation showed that predator contact rate did not differ significantly among prey species, but that attack, capture probabilities, and handling time did. Second, we performed population dynamics experiments with two prey species competing for a single resource at different levels of predation. Predation extended coexistence of the competing rotifers, whereas the inferior competitor was excluded in the absence of the predator. In some pairwise experiments, we found that the greater the predation level, the larger the relative increase in density of the inferior competitor. Our results suggest that predation can affect the dynamics of very similar competing species in natural aquatic communities, promoting coexistence.",https://doi.org/10.4319/lo.2004.49.1.0040,0
314,Allelopathy and resource competition: the effects of Phragmites australis invasion in plant communities,"Phragmites australis, a ubiquitous wetland plant, has been considered one of the most invasive species in the world. Allelopathy appears to be one of the invasion mechanisms, however, the effects could be masked by resource competition among target plants. The difficulty of distinguishing allelopathy from resource competition among plants has hindered investigations of the role of phytotoxic allelochemicals in plant communities. This has been addressed via experiments conducted in both the greenhouse and laboratory by growing associated plants, Melaleuca ericifolia, Rumex conglomeratus, and model plant, Lactuca sativa at varying densities with the allelopathic plant, P. australis, its litter and leachate of P. australis litter. This study investigated the potential interacting influences of allelopathy and resource competition on plant growth-density relationships.In greenhouse, the root exudates mediated effects showed the strongest growth inhibition of M. ericifolia at high density whereas litter mediated results revealed increased growth at medium density treatments compared to low and high density. Again, laboratory experiments related to seed germination and seedling growth of L. sativa and R. conglomeratus exhibited phytotoxicity decreased showing positive growth as plant density increased and vice versa. Overall, the differential effects were observed among experiments but maximum individual plant biomass and some other positive effects on plant traits such as root and shoot length, chlorophyll content occurred at an intermediate density. This was attributed to the sharing of the available phytotoxin among plants at high densities which is compatible to density-dependent phytotoxicity model.The results demonstrated that plant-plant interference is the combined effect of allelopathy and resource competition with many other factors but this experimental design, target-neighbor mixed-culture in combination of plant grown at varying densities with varying level of phytotoxins, mono-culture, can successfully separate allelopathic effects from competition.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s40529-017-0183-9,0
315,Sex allocation in response to local resource competition over breeding territories,"Sex allocation according to local resource competition suggests that investment and offspring sex ratio should be biased toward the dispersing sex to limit the competition among the natal philopatric sex. Conversely, when competition over resources is low, parents should allocate more resources toward the philopatric sex. In this study, this reciprocal scenario of sex allocation is tested. More specifically, the effect of breeding territory availability on primary sex ratio is studied in the collared flycatcher, a migratory passerine bird, where males are the natal philopatric sex. As predicted, primary sex ratios were biased toward males in areas where available territories were abundant (estimated from population growth). No relationship between sex ratio adjustment and adult phenotypes as well as date of first egg was found. We discuss potential explanation for the male-biased broods in areas with many vacant territories and low levels of competition. We suggest that sex ratio adjustment in relation to breeding territory quality and availability could be relatively common in birds.",https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arp002,0
316,A Competition Hierarchy among Boreal Ants: Impact on Resource Partitioning and Community Structure,"Differences in social organization and behaviour rank ant species into a competition hierarchy (starting with superior competitors): territorials (e.g., the Formica rufa -group red wood ants), encounterers (e.g. Camponotus, Lasius niger), and submissives (e.g., Formica fusca). Territorials and encounterers behave aggressively against individuals of alien colonies; these species are not expected to cooccur. Submissives behave recessively and may coexist with stronger species, but their forager numbers and nest densities should decrease. If such small-scale behavioural processes structure the ant community, predictable larger-scale nest-distribution pattern of the species is expected. We tested the expectations with bait experiments and nest mapping, and modelled the results by multiway contingency tables. Submissives showed complementary abundances with territorials in terms of forager numbers on the baits, and their nest densities within the territory increased toward its periphery. Pressure by territorial and encounter species on the baits caused the submissive species to shift from protein to carbohydrate. Territorials and encounterers had complementary occurrences on the baits. The nests of territorials were far apart, with only occasional nests of encounter species at the outskirts of the territory. In the late successional habitats of the boreal taiga biome superior territorial competitors, especially the polycalic red wood ant species, assume the role of organizing centers of ant species assemblages.",https://doi.org/10.2307/3565636,0
317,Resource Competition Triggers the Co-Evolution of Long Tongues and Deep Corolla Tubes,"Background It is normally thought that deep corolla tubes evolve when a plant's successful reproduction is contingent on having a corolla tube longer than the tongue of the flower's pollinators, and that pollinators evolve ever-longer tongues because individuals with longer tongues can obtain more nectar from flowers. A recent model shows that, in the presence of pollinators with long and short tongues that experience resource competition, coexisting plant species can diverge in corolla-tube depth, because this increases the proportion of pollen grains that lands on co-specific flowers. Methodology/Principal Findings We have extended the model to study whether resource competition can trigger the co-evolution of tongue length and corolla-tube depth. Starting with two plant and two pollinator species, all of them having the same distribution of tongue length or corolla-tube depth, we show that variability in corolla-tube depth leads to divergence in tongue length, provided that increasing tongue length is not equally costly for both species. Once the two pollinator species differ in tongue length, divergence in corolla-tube depth between the two plant species ensues. Conclusions/Significance Co-evolution between tongue length and corolla-tube depth is a robust outcome of the model, obtained for a wide range of parameter values, but it requires that tongue elongation is substantially easier for one pollinator species than for the other, that pollinators follow a near-optimal foraging strategy, that pollinators experience competition for resources and that plants experience pollination limitation.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002992,0
318,EFFECTS OF COMPETITION ON RESOURCE AVAILABILITY AND GROWTH OF A CALIFORNIA BUNCHGRASS,"In California, little is known about the sensitivity of native bunchgrasses to competition or to changes in resource availability. We investigated the effect of nonnative annual vegetation on resource availability and growth of a native bunchgrass, Nassella pulchra, in a pair of factorial field experiments that incorporated effects of both interspecific and intraspecific competition as well as variation in soil depth. Plots of differing target densities and neighborhoods were used to assess changes in aboveground (light) and belowground (water) resource availability over multiple seasons in two sites with differing soil depth. N. pulchra grown without interspecific competitors grew larger and produced more culms at all planting densities compared to plants in plots with interspecific competitors. Intraspecific competition significantly influenced growth only in the absence of interspecific competition. Reproductive effort, as measured by flowering culm production, was more sensitive than vegetative growth to both forms of competition. Light availability and variability at the soil surface was greatly reduced by the nonnative annual neighborhood. As expected, soil moisture was rapidly depleted by annuals to 30 cm in all plots. In deep-soil plots, soil moisture was reduced at 60–150 cm depths only when annual vegetation was removed, and depletion was correlated with N. pulchra basal area. This result suggests that the interspecific neighborhood reduced root growth in N. pulchra and its subsequent ability to use deep moisture. Within California's inland grasslands, nonnative annual vegetation has changed seasonal patterns of resource availability. We conclude that (1) increased competition for light during the spring, when growth of annuals is most rapid, suppresses growth and reproduction of N. pulchra; (2) by suppressing bunchgrass growth, annual grasses reduce access to belowground resources by competitive interference; and (3) the loss of perennial grasses in California grasslands and the general dominance by nonnative annual species results in the relative underutilization of deep soil resources. These conclusions suggest that the dominance of California grasslands by nonnative annual vegetation has shifted the primary limiting resource from soil moisture to light and the timing of resource limitation from summer to winter and spring.",https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[2697:eocora]2.0.co;2,0
319,Resource Partitioning and Competition within a Guild of Fugitive Prairie Plants,"Badger disturbances on tall-grass prairies constitute a limiting resource for a guild of fugitive plants. These plants partition the resource along several dimensions. Divergent centers of resource utilization result from different suites of adaptive life-history characteristics important during colonization. While overlap of utilization functions is considerable along single dimensions of the resource, complementary adaptations of species result in reduced overlap along a complex gradient integrating the separate dimensions. We predict that the number, packing, and organization of species into a guild will change as the nature of the limiting resource changes. Specifically, changes in the abundance of the resource alter the heterogeneity of the resource over space, and as a result relationships among the adaptive centers of resource utilization for species also change. Predictions of changes in resource partitioning and guild organization, based upon assumptions concerning competition among species populations, correspond very closely to empirical field observations. In nature, composition of the fugitive species guild is expected to vary locally with changes in the nature and spatial heterogeneity of badger disturbances, and this variation over space also will depend upon the colonization capabilities of the species. Field investigation of competition provided insight into relationships among species comprising the fugitive guild. Competitive interactions are closely related to the adaptive life-history characteristics involved in the colonization of badger disturbances. The type of interaction occurring among individuals on a site depends upon events occurring during the colonization phase of the life cycle, and different types of competitive interactions have different effects upon the likelihood of subsequent site colonization (i.e., reproductive success of interacting individuals). Both the frequency and types of competitive interactions occurring among individuals in fugitive populations are predicted to depend upon the abundance of the limiting resource; the likelihood of colonization will change as the spatial distribution of colonization sites changes. Thus, the effects of changes in the distribution of the resource over space upon the relative colonization rates of species must be known to predict accurately the impact of competition upon resource partitioning and organization of fugitive plant populations into a guild.",https://doi.org/10.1086/283180,0
320,Body size and shape responses to warming and resource competition,"Abstract Body size is a fundamental trait that impacts many aspects of species biology and ecology. It is, in turn, influenced by a suite of environmental factors, and often decreases with warming. Although environmental conditions can also impact body shape, which is another functional trait that influences locomotion, resource acquisition and potentially physiological processes, such responses are poorly understood and rarely quantified. We experimentally tested the independent and combined effects of environmental temperature, resource level and interspecific competition on the body shape and size responses of two model protist species. We also tested the degree to which these individual‐level phenotypic responses are associated with population densities and species coexistence. Body shape was strongly influenced by resource competition, whereas body size changes were mainly driven by environmental temperature. In both species, lower resource levels resulted in body shape elongation, suggesting that relatively more elongate individuals with potentially higher swimming speed were advantaged in the resource scarce environment. However, competition had contrasting influence on the body shape of the two species. Competition decreased the population densities of Blepharisma japonicum , which exhibited relative body shape elongation, similar to the response at low resource levels. In contrast, competition increased the population densities of Paramecium aurelia , which exhibited reduced elongation similar to body shape response at high resource levels. Hence, body shape responses could be indicative of changes in resource availability, aiding our understanding of competitive hierarchies and species interactions. Coexistence was observed in all treatment combinations, likely because body size of both species decreased similarly under warming, potentially maintaining constant per capita competitive intensity. These findings, along with recent research on phytoplankton, diverse pelagic invertebrates, and birds highlight the importance of body shape and morphology across different taxonomic groups. Hence, we call for body size and shape to be considered in concert when investigating ecological consequences of climate warming.

321,Limiting Similarity? The Ecological Dynamics of Natural Selection among Resources and Consumers Caused by Both Apparent and Resource Competition,"Much of ecological theory presumes that natural selection should foster species coexistence by phenotypically differentiating competitors so that the stability of the community is increased, but whether this will actually occur is a question of the ecological dynamics of natural selection. I develop an evolutionary model of consumer-resource interactions based on MacArthur's and Tilman's classic works, including both resource and apparent competition, to explore what fosters or retards the differentiation of resources and their consumers. Analyses of this model predict that consumers will differentiate only on specific ranges of environmental gradients (e.g., greater productivity, weaker stressors, lower structural complexity), and where it occurs, the magnitude of differentiation also depends on gradient position. In contrast to ""limiting similarity"" expectations, greater intraspecific phenotypic variance results in less differentiation among the consumers because of how phenotypic variation alters the fitness landscapes driving natural selection. In addition, the final structure of the community that results from the coevolution of these interacting species may be highly contingent on the initial properties of the species as the community is being assembled. These results highlight the fact that evolutionary conclusions about community structure cannot be based on ecological arguments of community stability or coexistence but rather must be explicitly based on the ecological dynamics of natural selection.",https://doi.org/10.1086/701629,0
322,Effects of Intraguild Predation: Evaluating Resource Competition between Two Canid Species with Apparent Niche Separation,"Many studies determine which habitat components are important to animals and the extent their use may overlap with competitive species. However, such studies are often undertaken after populations are in decline or under interspecific stress. Since habitat selection is not independent of interspecific stress, quantifying an animal's current landscape use could be misleading if the species distribution is suboptimal. We present an alternative approach by modeling the predicted distributions of two sympatric species on the landscape using dietary preferences and prey distribution. We compared the observed habitat use of kit foxes ( Vulpes macrotis ) and coyotes ( Canis latrans ) against their predicted distribution. Data included locations of kit foxes and coyotes, carnivore scat transects, and seasonal prey surveys. Although habitats demonstrated heterogeneity with respect to prey resources, only coyotes showed habitat use designed to maximize access to prey. In contrast, kit foxes used habitats which did not align closely with prey resources. Instead, habitat use by kit foxes represented spatial and behavioral strategies designed to minimize spatial overlap with coyotes while maximizing access to resources. Data on the distribution of prey, their dietary importance, and the species-specific disparities between predicted and observed habitat distributions supports a mechanism by which kit fox distribution is derived from intense competitive interactions with coyotes.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/629246,0
323,Resource competition can explain simplicity in microbial community assembly,"Predicting the composition and diversity of communities is a central goal in ecology. While community assembly is considered hard to predict, laboratory microcosms often follow a simple assembly rule based on the outcome of pairwise competitions. This assembly rule predicts that a species that is excluded by another species in pairwise competition cannot survive in a multispecies community with that species. Despite the empirical success of this bottom–up prediction, its mechanistic origin has remained elusive. In this study, we elucidate how this simple pattern in community assembly can emerge from resource competition. Our geometric analysis of a consumer-resource model shows that trio community assembly is always predictable from pairwise outcomes when one species grows faster than another species on every resource. We also identify all possible trio assembly outcomes under three resources and find that only two outcomes violate the assembly rule. Simulations demonstrate that pairwise competitions accurately predict trio assembly with up to 100 resources and the assembly of larger communities containing up to twelve species. We then further demonstrate accurate quantitative prediction of community composition using the harmonic mean of pairwise fractions. Finally, we show that cross-feeding between species does not decrease assembly rule prediction accuracy. Our findings highlight that simple community assembly can emerge even in ecosystems with complex underlying dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2212113120,0
324,A Graphical-Mechanistic Approach to Spatial Resource Competition,"Ecological communities are structured by processes operating at multiple spatial scales, which results in an often daunting complexity. Here we present a simple graphical theory to study the interaction of two fundamental community processes: resource competition at the local scale and dispersal at the regional scale. We consider a metacommunity model with two habitat patches in which consumer species compete for a spatially distributed resource. We introduce a graphical construction of the equilibrium metacommunity composition, analogous to traditional competition theory for two resources. As in the nonspatial case, the zero net growth isoclines (ZNGIs) play a central role in the analysis. We show that a consumer species' ZNGI depends on its dispersal characteristics, and this dependence leads to a unification of various dispersal-based coexistence mechanisms. We illustrate this unification using four specific mechanisms: species-specific dispersal rates, spatially asymmetric dispersal, resource-dependent dispersal, and competition between habitat specialists and generalists.",https://doi.org/10.1086/679066,0
325,"The relative importance of seed competition, resource competition and perturbations on community structure","Abstract. While the regional climate is the primary selection pressure for whether a plant strategy can survive, however, competitive interactions strongly affect the relative abundances of plant strategies within communities. Here, we investigate the relative importance of competition and perturbations on the development of vegetation community structure. To do so, we develop DIVE (Dynamics and Interactions of VEgetation), a simple general model that links plant strategies to their competitive dynamics, using growth and reproduction characteristics that emerge from climatic constraints. The model calculates population dynamics based on establishment, mortality, invasion and exclusion in the presence of different strengths of perturbations, seed and resource competition. The highest levels of diversity were found in simulations without competition as long as mortality is not too high. However, reasonable successional dynamics were only achieved when resource competition is considered. Under high levels of competition, intermediate levels of perturbations were required to obtain coexistence. Since succession and coexistence are observed in plant communities, we conclude that the DIVE model with competition and intermediate levels of perturbation represents an adequate way to model population dynamics. Because of the simplicity and generality of DIVE, it could be used to understand vegetation structure and functioning at the global scale and the response of vegetation to global change.",https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-8-1107-2011,0

327,Breeding state and season affect interspecific interaction types: indirect resource competition and direct interference,"Indirect resource competition and interference are widely occurring mechanisms of interspecific interactions. We have studied the seasonal expression of these two interaction types within a two-species, boreal small mammal system. Seasons differ by resource availability, individual breeding state and intraspecific social system. Live-trapping methods were used to monitor space use and reproduction in 14 experimental populations of bank voles Myodes glareolus in large outdoor enclosures with and without a dominant competitor, the field vole Microtus agrestis. We further compared vole behaviour using staged dyadic encounters in neutral arenas in both seasons. Survival of the non-breeding overwintering bank voles was not affected by competition. In the spring, the numbers of male bank voles, but not of females, were reduced significantly in the competition populations. Bank vole home ranges expanded with vole density in the presence of competitors, indicating food limitation. A comparison of behaviour between seasons based on an analysis of similarity revealed an avoidance of costly aggression against opponents, independent of species. Interactions were more aggressive during the summer than during the winter, and heterospecific encounters were more aggressive than conspecific encounters. Based on these results, we suggest that interaction types and their respective mechanisms are not either–or categories and may change over the seasons. During the winter, energy constraints and thermoregulatory needs decrease direct aggression, but food constraints increase indirect resource competition. Direct interference appears in the summer, probably triggered by each individual’s reproductive and hormonal state and the defence of offspring against conspecific and heterospecific intruders. Both interaction forms overlap in the spring, possibly contributing to spring declines in the numbers of subordinate species.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-011-2008-y,0
328,Potential for Resource Competition between Eurasian Ruffe and Yellow Perch: Growth and RNA Responses in Laboratory Experiments,"The ruffe Gymnocephalus cernuus, an exotic percid from Eurasia that is now established in limited areas of the Great Lakes, is invading areas currently occupied by native yellow perch Perca flavescens. We conducted two laboratory experiments to determine whether competition for benthic macroinvertebrate food (live aquatic oligochaetes) may occur, thereby resulting in reduced growth for one or both fish species. In the first experiment, we compared the short-term (7-d) growth of ruffe and yellow perch among four treatments: one individual (ruffe or yellow perch), two conspecifics (two ruffe or two yellow perch), one fish of each species together, and two fish of each species together (N = 9 per treatment). Growth was measured both as change in mass and as RNA levels in the white muscle tissue of fish, which is an index of short-term growth. In the second experiment, we looked at longer-term (58-d) growth using three treatments: two conspecifics alone, one fish of each species together, and two fish of each species together (N = 3 per treatment). The growth rates of ruffe did not differ significantly from those of yellow perch in a given treatment in either experiment. In both experiments, however, the growth of both species declined about 70% in the high-density treatments (two fish of each species together) compared with the low-density treatments. The results of RNA analyses were consistent with change in mass and represent an alternative approach to assessing growth responses. In ruffe−yellow perch interactions in nature, total fish density may be more important than species composition in determining growth rates when food is limiting. Therefore, ruffe invasions that increase overall fish density may be detrimental to the growth of yellow perch.",https://doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<1331:pfrcbe>2.0.co;2,0
329,"Sexual dimorphism driven by intersexual resource competition: Why is it rare, and where to look for it?","Abstract Sexes often differ more obviously in secondary sexual characteristics than in traits that appear naturally selected, despite conceivable benefits to intersexual niche partitioning. Genetic constraints may play a role in limiting sex‐specific niche evolution; however, it is not clear why this limit should apply to naturally selected traits more than those under sexual selection; the latter routinely produces dimorphism. We ask whether ecological factors and/or features of the mating system limit dimorphism in resource use, or conversely, what conditions are the most permissible ones for sexual niche differences. The scale of mating competition and spatial variation in resource availability can help predict sexually dimorphic niches or the lack thereof. We investigate why and when dimorphism might fail to evolve even if genetic covariation between the sexes posed no constraint. Our analytical model incorporates the first aspect of spatial interactions (scale of mating competition). It is followed by simulations that explore broader conditions, including multiple resources with habitat heterogeneity, genetic correlations and non‐Gaussian resource‐use efficiency functions. We recover earlier known conditions for favourable conditions for the evolution of niche partitioning between sexes, such as narrow individual niche and low degrees of genetic constraint. We also show spatial considerations to alter this picture. Sexual niche divergence occurs more readily when local mating groups are small and different resources occur reliably across habitats. Polygyny (medium‐sized or large mating groups) can diminish the prospects for dimorphism even if no genetic constraints are present. Habitat heterogeneity typically also disfavours niche dimorphism but can also lead to polymorphism within a sex, if it is beneficial to specialize to be very competitive in one habitat, even at a cost to performance in the other. Sexual conflict is usually used to explain dimorphic traits or behaviours. Our models highlight that introducing conflict (achieved by switching from monogamy to polygamy) can also be responsible for sexual monomorphism. Under monogamy, males benefit from specializing to consume other resources than what feeds the female best. Polygyny makes males disregard this female benefit, and both sexes compete for the most profitable resource, leading to overlapping niches.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13487,0
330,Modulation of antibiotic effects on microbial communities by resource competition,"Abstract Antibiotic treatment significantly impacts the human gut microbiota, but quantitative understanding of how antibiotics affect community diversity is lacking. Here, we build on classical ecological models of resource competition to investigate community responses to species-specific death rates, as induced by antibiotic activity or other growth-inhibiting factors such as bacteriophages. Our analyses highlight the complex dependence of species coexistence that can arise from the interplay of resource competition and antibiotic activity, independent of other biological mechanisms. In particular, we identify resource competition structures that cause richness to depend on the order of sequential application of antibiotics (non-transitivity), and the emergence of synergistic and antagonistic effects under simultaneous application of multiple antibiotics (non-additivity). These complex behaviors can be prevalent, especially when generalist consumers are targeted. Communities can be prone to either synergism or antagonism, but typically not both, and antagonism is more common. Furthermore, we identify a striking overlap in competition structures that lead to non-transitivity during antibiotic sequences and those that lead to non-additivity during antibiotic combination. In sum, our results establish a broadly applicable framework for predicting microbial community dynamics under deleterious perturbations.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-37895-x,0
331,Resource Competition and an Analytical Model of Zooplankton Feeding on Phytoplankton,"In this paper we have developed a new consumer-resource model, with specific reference to zooplankton feeding on phytoplankton. In principle, the model can be extended to any terrestrial or aquatic community in which the consumers graze nearly randomly (as described by the grazing rate parameter fi) on food which has relatively little mobile escape capability. In contrast with the intuitive or phenomenological approaches often used in constructing competition models, we have tried to derive the consumer-resource interaction term from first principles as much as possible. We developed a general form with clearly defined parameters that represent fundamental system processes such as consumer filtering rate. We particularized the model parameters to describe two known forms of feeding: (1) saturation feeding in which the rate remains constant above a given food density while the filtering rate decreases, and (2) inhibited feeding in which a decline appears at high food density. From an examination of the model's equilibrium equations for strongly similar zooplankton species feeding on similar phytoplankton species, we have drawn the following conclusions: (1) The competitive exclusion principle has only limited validity. For a community in which the consumers exhibit no intraspecific competition and have identical assimilation efficiency to death-rate ratios, ē/d, any number of consumer species may, in fact, coexist and compete for the same food. Communities in which the consumer species have identical ē/d are probably rare. However, in a community with intraspecific competition (a common occurrence) any number of consumer species, with a wide spectrum of ē/d ratios, may coexist and compete for the same food. (2) The equations for a complex community composed of many consumer and food species can be reduced to a single equation whose form is identical with that of a single-consumer, single-food system. This implies that, at equilibrium, structurally complex communities may behave functionally like simple ones. (3) The standard competition coefficient, α, of the Volterra equation is a poor measure of competition in nonlinear systems. It exhibits incongruous variations with changes in system parameters. We have proposed a new definition of competition coefficient, Cin, which is based on derivatives of state variables evaluated at the system operating point and which eliminates the incongruities exhibited by α. In a community with no intraspecific competition, all Cin are unity. In a community with intraspecific competition, the Cin tend to equalize as the number of food species increases, resulting in equal competitive strength of all consumer species in systems of the type studied here.",https://doi.org/10.1086/283028,0
332,Resource partitioning and interspecific competition in snakes: the search for general geographical and guild patterns,"The role of interspecific competition as a key factor in the ecology of natural communities where species exploit limited resources is well established, and the study of competition dynamics in snake communities has received much attention in recent years. Twenty years ago, an acclaimed review ( Toft 1985 ) suggested that snakes were atypical among vertebrates because sympatric species usually partition the food niche. Here, I review the articles published in the last two decades with the aim of finding any general geographical or guild patterns and assessing if Toft's main conclusion is still supported by new evidence. Where appropriate, I use Monte Carlo simulations to establish whether observed patterns of niche overlap are real, or if they have occurred by chance. My study shows clear congruence in the patterns of coexistence exhibited by snake communities in different regions of the world, i.e.: (1) cold regions of the northern hemisphere (high latitudes and altitudes) exhibit low species richness and a very low, or even absent, potential for interspecific competition; (2) aquatic snakes that form communities in temperate regions generally partition the food type available and exhibit a broad similarity in habitat use with subtle differences in microhabitat use; (3) terrestrial snake communities in temperate regions are very variable in terms of their coexistence dynamics and show no evidence of generalised patterns; (4) sympatric viperids in Europe, North America and, most interestingly, tropical Asia partition the available habitat but not the prey resource; (5) competition is much stronger in tropical snake communities, and the intensity of this process fluctuates throughout the year being most intense during periods of low food availability; (6) in general, tropical snakes partition the food resource (prey type and/or prey size), but when this resource is not partitioned competitive exclusion can occur. Prey resource availability is a fundamental variable for all snake communities; this is clearly documented by studies on terrestrial snakes in Australia where, due to a relative scarcity of prey availability in the field, sympatry among species is much rarer than in other continents. I conclude that, although there are several notable exceptions, Toft's main conclusion is still supported by empirical evidence. However, I disagree with Toft's conclusion that most snakes are food specialists, and I contend that interspecific competition is important in structuring many (if not most) of the snake communities around the world.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14064.x,0
333,Resource Competition and Host Feedbacks Underlie Regime Shifts in Gut Microbiota,"AbstractThe spread of an enteric pathogen in the human gut depends on many interacting factors, including pathogen exposure, diet, host gut environment, and host microbiota, but how these factors jointly influence infection outcomes remains poorly characterized. Here we develop a model of host-mediated resource competition between mutualistic and pathogenic taxa in the gut that aims to explain why similar hosts, exposed to the same pathogen, can have such different infection outcomes. Our model successfully reproduces several empirically observed phenomena related to transitions between healthy and infected states, including (1) the nonlinear relationship between pathogen inoculum size and infection persistence, (2) the elevated risk of chronic infection during or after treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, (3) the resolution of gut dysbiosis with fecal microbiota transplants, and (4) the potential protection from infection conferred by probiotics. We then use the model to explore how host-mediated interventions-namely, shifts in the supply rates of electron donors (e.g., dietary fiber) and respiratory electron acceptors (e.g., oxygen)-can potentially be used to direct gut community assembly. Our study demonstrates how resource competition and ecological feedbacks between the host and the gut microbiota can be critical determinants of human health outcomes. We identify several testable model predictions ready for experimental validation.",https://doi.org/10.1086/714527,0
334,Effects of Reduced Interspecific Competition on Resource Utilization in Perch (Perca Fluviatilis),"The effects of a reduction in the size of a roach (Rutilus rutilus) population on a perch (Perca fluviatilis) population were studied. The population size of roach was reduced by 70% and the biomass by 40%. The biomass of the perch population increased by 140%, which was a result of an increase in young—of—the—year (0+) perch. The consumption of the adult perch population increased more than two—fold compared to the situation before the removal experiment. 0+ perch did not switch in August from a diet of zooplankton to a diet of macroinvertebrates, as was the case before the removal experiment, and they also expanded their habitat. This resulted in a reduced age class competition, and the limitations set by the macroinvertebrate bottleneck phase in the life period of perch were reduced. Though the removal experiment lacked a control, the considerable response of both the zooplankton community and the perch population strongly suggests that roach greatly influenced the resource intake and resource utilization of perch.",https://doi.org/10.2307/1938578,0
335,Molecular signatures of resource competition: Clonal interference favors ecological diversification and can lead to incipient speciation*,"Microbial ecosystems harbor an astonishing diversity that can persist for long times. To understand how such diversity is structured and maintained, ecological and evolutionary processes need to be integrated at similar timescales. Here, we study a model of resource competition that allows for evolution via de novo mutation, and focus on rapidly adapting asexual populations with large mutational inputs, as typical of many bacteria species. We characterize the adaptation and diversification of an initially maladapted population and show how the eco-evolutionary dynamics are shaped by the interaction between simultaneously emerging lineages - clonal interference. We find that in large populations, more intense clonal interference can foster diversification under sympatry, increasing the probability that phenotypically and genetically distinct clusters coexist. In smaller populations, the accumulation of deleterious and compensatory mutations can push further the diversification process and kick-start speciation. Our findings have implications beyond microbial populations, providing novel insights about the interplay between ecology and evolution in clonal populations.",https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.14315,0
336,Nematode Interactions on Beetle Hosts Indicate a Role of Mouth-Form Plasticity in Resource Competition,"Competition is rampant across kingdoms, arising over potential mates, food resources, and space availability. When faced with opponents, phenotypic plasticity proffers organisms indispensable advantageous strategies to outcompete rivals. This tactic is especially crucial on decaying insect hosts as myriad microbes and numerous nematodes struggle to establish thriving populations and ensure resource availability for future generations. Scarab beetles and their associated nematode symbionts on La Réunion Island have provided exceptional systems to study complicated cross-phylum interactions in soil, and recently we have identified a previously unexplored beetle host, Gymnogaster bupthalma , to be reliably co-infested with diplogastrids Pristionchus mayeri and Acrostichus spp. These nematodes maintain the capacity to plastically respond to environmental conditions by developing disparate mouth forms, a strict bacterial-feeding morph or an omnivorous morph that enables predation on other nematodes. In addition, under stressful settings these worms can enter an arrested development stage called dauer, non-feeding dispersal larvae that resume development into reproducing adults when conditions improve. By investigating this beetle-nematode system in a natural context, we uncovered a novel Pristionchus strategy, wherein dauer dispersal from the carcass is gradual and a reproducing population is sustained. Remarkably, usually preferential-bacterial morph P. mayeri develop as predators in populations dense with competitors.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2021.752695,0
337,Resource Overlap and Competition in Pond Snails: An Experimental Analysis,"Several ponds were quantitatively sampled in northeastern Indiana, and the relative abundances of pulmonate snails were determined. Feeding preferences, on several natural food types, were estimated in feeding trials in the laboratory. The two main objectives of the study were to determine (1) which species pair had the highest resource overlap along the habitat and food dimensions of the niche, and (2) whether these species actually suffered decreased growth or fecundity due to competition. Sampling data and feeding trials indicate that Aplexa hypnorum is a specialist in both habitat and food use, and is a detritivore in heavily wooded, temporary ponds. Lymnaea elodes is more common in partially wooded, temporary ponds, and specializes on periphyton and carrion. Physa gyrina has a broad utilization of both the habitat and food dimensions of the niche. Helisoma trivolvis is a generalist in food preference, but was common in this study only in a permanent pond. These data, and niche overlap estimates based on them, predict that L. elodes and P. gyrina should have the greatest overlap on resources. Manipulative field experiments, in three different ponds, suggest that high overlap along the habitat and dietary dimensions of the niche results in competition in these freshwater snails. Interspecific competition decreased fecundity in P. gyrina, but not in L. elodes, in two separate experiments. For both species, interspecific competition had less of an effect than increased conspecific densities on growth rates. Physa generally did better in the less productive, temporary ponds, while L. elodes had higher fecundities and growth rates in a permanent, more productive pond. Lymnaea elodes was considered the better competitor because interspecific competition had smaller effects on growth and reproduction than intraspecific competition. Data on size—specific reproductive rates suggest that the earlier reproducing P. gyrina may be able to exploit more ephemeral habitats as refuges.",https://doi.org/10.2307/1938959,0
338,Temperature and depth mediate resource competition and apparent competition between <i>Mysis diluviana</i> and kokanee,"In many food webs, species in similar trophic positions can interact either by competing for resources or boosting shared predators (apparent competition), but little is known about how the relative strengths of these interactions vary across environmental gradients. Introduced Mysis diluviana shrimp interact with planktivorous fishes such as kokanee salmon (lacustrine Oncorhynchus nerka ) through both of these pathways, and effective management depends on understanding which interaction is more limiting under different conditions. An “environmental matching” hypothesis predicts the ecological impacts of Mysis are maximized under cool conditions near its thermal optimum. In addition, we hypothesized Mysis is more vulnerable to predation by lake trout in relatively shallow waters, and therefore Mysis enhances lake trout density and limits kokanee through apparent competition more strongly in shallower habitats. We tested whether these hypotheses could explain food web differences between two connected lake basins, one relatively shallow and the other extremely deep. The shallower basin warmed faster, thermally excluded Mysis from surface waters for 75% longer, and supported 2.5–18 times greater seasonal production of cladoceran zooplankton than the deeper basin, standardized by surface area. Mysis consumed 14–22% less zooplankton in the shallower basin, and lower ratios of total planktivore consumption to zooplankton production (C:P) indicated less potential for resource competition with kokanee, consistent with environmental matching. Lake trout diets contained more Mysis in the shallower basin and at shallower sampling sites within both basins. The catch rate of lake trout was seven times greater and the predation risk for kokanee was 4–5 times greater in the shallower basin than in the deeper basin, consistent with stronger apparent competition in shallower habitats. Understanding how the strengths of these interactions are mediated by temperature and depth would enable managers to select appropriate strategies to address the unique combinations of conditions in hundreds of affected systems.",https://doi.org/10.1890/14-1822.1,0
339,Intraspecific competition drives multiple species resource polymorphism in fish communities,"It has been hypothesized that inter‐specific competition will reduce species niche utilization and drive morphological evolution in character displacement. In the absence of a competitor, intra‐specific competition may favor an expansion of the species niche and drive morphological evolution in character release. Despite of this theoretical framework, we sometimes find potential competitor species using the same niche range without any partitioning in niche. We used a database on test fishing in Sweden to evaluate the factors (inter‐ and intraspecific competition, predation, and abiotic factors) that could influence habitat choice of two competitor species. The pattern from the database shows that the occurrence of perch and roach occupying both littoral and pelagic habitats of lakes in Sweden is a general phenomenon. Furthermore, the results from the database suggest that this pattern is due to intra‐specific competition rather than inter‐specific competition or predation. In a field study, we estimated the morphological variation in perch and roach and found that, individuals of both species caught in the littoral zone were more deeper bodied compared to individuals caught in the pelagic zone. Pelagic perch fed more on zooplankton compared to littoral perch, independent of size, whereas the littoral perch had more macroinvertebrates and fish in their diet. Pelagic roach fed more on zooplankton compared to littoral roach, whereas littoral individuals fed more on plant material. Furthermore, we sampled littoral and pelagic fish from another lake to evaluate the generality of our first results and found the same habitat associated morphology in both perch and roach. The results show a consistent multi‐species morphological separation in the littoral and pelagic habitats. This study suggests that intra‐specific competition is possibly more important than inter‐specific competition for the morphological pattern in the perch‐roach system.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.16267.x,0
340,Food as a Limited Resource in Competition between Two Species of Terrestrial Salamanders,"The terrestrial salamander Plethodon richmondi shenandoah occurs primarily in areas of talus, apparently excluded from surrounding areas of deep soil by Plethodon cinereus. Although the two species are closely related P. r. shenandoah grows to a longer body length and has a broader head. All ages classes of P. r. shenandoah emigrate out of the talus and are found within 3 m of the talus edge, but only adults which are as large as or larger than the largest P. cinereus are able to survive farther than about 3 m from the talus. This distribution is not explained by a tendency for large adults to wander more than juveniles. The large P. r. shenandoah in the soil take prey that are significantly larger than prey taken by conhabiting P. cinerueus, indicating that food may be the limited resource for which competition occurs. Both species are euryphagic and prey upon the same taxa of small animals. Food is periodically limited in availability, but not in abundance. Following a rain, salamanders forage freely and consume a large quantity of prey, based on stomach contents, but prey become increasingly unavailable as the soil and leaf litter dry and the salamanders are restricted to isolated pockets of moisture. Stomachs remain virtually empty until the next rain, at which time they are full again indicating that the abundance of prey is not greatly affected by the intervening dryness. Food may periodically become a limited resource during long dry seasons and as such may affect the survival of the salamanders or their ability to produce eggs. It is not clear whether interspecific competition is through differential exploitation of the limited resource or through interference. Lack of evidence for interspecific aggression may indicate that the former occurs, although it could not be demonstrated experimentally. Contiguous allopatry between the two species seems to result from an interaction of competitive exclusion and differential tolerance to dryness; P. cinereus is presumably a superior competitor for food in the soil and excludes P. r. shenandoah to areas of talus which P. cinereus cannot enter due to its tolerance of drier conditions in the rocks.",https://doi.org/10.2307/1934249,0
341,Carry-over effects of resource competition and social environment on aggression,"Abstract Aggressive behavior is common in many species and is often adaptive because it enables individuals to gain access to limited resources. However, aggression is also highly plastic and the degree of plasticity could be influenced by factors such as resource limitation and the social environment. In this study, we examined how the effects of social experience and resource limitation could persist to affect future aggressive interactions. Using naturally inbred strains of Drosophila melanogaster that differ in aggressiveness, we manipulated the level of available resources by varying fly density (two treatments: high and low per capita resources) and group composition by varying strain frequency (five treatments: homogeneous strains, or mixed at 1:3, 1:1 or 3:1 ratios of the more aggressive to less-aggressive strain). For each treatment group, we measured aggression before and after flies were placed through a 4-day period of fixed resources. There was no consistent effect of resource competition on aggression. Instead, changes in aggression depended on resource availability in combination with group composition. In homogeneous groups made up of only one strain, all males became more aggressive following the fixed-resource period, regardless of fly density. In mixed-strain treatments at high density, we observed plastic shifts in aggression of males from both strains, but the direction of plastic responses depended on social composition. Our results show that aggression may not only be influenced by the intensity of previous competitive experiences caused by resource limitation, but also through social effects caused by the composition of the group.",https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arz170,0
342,Diel Changes in Resource Demand: Competition and Predation in Species Replacement among Crayfishes,"With laboratory experiments and field surveys, we examine community—structuring mechanisms in a system undergoing invasion. Orconectes rusticus, an invading crayfish species, is replacing O. propinquus and O. Virilis in northern Wisconsin lakes. We test the hypothesis that periodicity of species interactions influences invasion success. Specifically, we test whether the intensity of interspecific competition varies on a diel cycle as a function of predation risk from visually feeding fishes. We tested for competitive exclusion in experimental pools (1.4 m in diameter) by determining habitat use of the three crayfishes in single—0 and three—species treatments. The pools contained equal area habitats of cobble, open sand, macrophytes in organic sediments (muck), and macrophytes in sand. In single—species treatments, all three species preferred cobble habitat during the day with a secondary preference for muck—macrophyte habitat. In three—species relative to single—species pools, O. rusticus increased daytime use of cobble habitat while O. virilis and O. propinquus reduced use of cobble and increased use of muck—macrophyte and sand—macrophyte habitats, respectively. Crayfish were evenly distributed among habitats at night. All three crayfishes altered habitat use between night and day, consistent with the need to forage at night and seek refuge from predation during the day. Results of a laboratory experiment giving crayfish the choice of feeding in the open or hiding in clean cobble in the presence and absence of a predator showed that crayfish chose habitat on the basis of food availability when predation risk was low and on the basis of shelter availability when risk was high. Data from experiments were consistent with habitat use observed in single— and mixed—species lakes, supporting our hypothesis that the interaction of competition with diel fluctuations in predation risk contributes to the ongoing O. rusticus invasion.",https://doi.org/10.2307/1941615,0

Densities of Oligochaeta (families Tubificidae and Enchytraeidae), Amphipoda, Insecta larvae, Polychaeta and macro-Nematoda, and a broad range of environmental factors were followed over 5 mo of caging. A significant increase of amphipod and insect larvae densities in the cages indicated a positive exclusion effect, while no such effect was observed for oligochaetes (Tubificidae in particular), polychaetes or macronematodes. Resource competitive interactions were a plausible explanation for the status of the amphipod community. This was supported by the parallel positive exclusion effect detected for microalgal densities. It is therefore hypothesized that competition for microalgae and deposited food sources is the determining structuring force exerted by the epibenthos on the macrobenthic infauna. However, the presence of epibenthic predation cannot be excluded. Macrobenthos . Infauna . Epibenthos . Exclusion experiment . Mangroves .

344,Survival of a specialist natural enemy experiencing resource competition with an omnivorous predator when sharing the invasive prey <i>Tuta absoluta</i>,"Abstract Can specialist natural enemies persist in ecosystems when competing with omnivorous natural enemies for their shared prey? The consequences of omnivory have been studied theoretically, but empirical studies are still lacking. Omnivory is nevertheless common in nature and omnivorous predators coexist with specialists in many ecosystems, even when they are intraguild predators. This type of association is also common in agroecosystems in which biological control strategies are used. Our study provides an example of the outcome of such an association in the context of biological control of the invasive pest Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera) in a tomato agroecosystem. The two natural enemies involved, that is, a specialist ( Stenomesius japonicus (Hymenoptera) parasitoid) and an omnivore ( Macrolophus pygmaeus (Hemiptera) predator), were able to coexist for 3 months in our experimental cages in the absence of metacommunity mechanisms (i.e., emigration and recolonization), contrary to theoretical expectations. However, they negatively affected each other's population dynamics. We found that spatial resource segregation was not a mechanism that promoted their coexistence. Regarding pest control, the specialist and omnivorous natural enemies were found to exhibit complementary functional traits, leading to the best control when together. Mechanisms that may have promoted the coexistence of the two species as well as consequences with regard to the inoculative biological control program are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.3396,0
345,Resource Use by Bill Morphs of An African Finch: Evidence for Intraspecific Competition,"The African estrildid finch Pyrenestes ostrinus exhibits a polymorphism in bill size that is not related to sex. This paper examines the feeding ecology, sessonal changes in abundance, and diet overlap of the two bill morphs on a study are in south—central Cameroon. The morphs fed on two major sedge species, hard and soft. The diets of the small— and large—billed morphs were influenced by their feeding efficiencies on the sedges and seed abundance. When both major sedges were abundant, diet overlap between morphs was high, but overlap declined during the major dry season when overall food abundance was low. During the dry season, large—billed morphs specialized on the hard—seeded sedge species while small—billed morphs broadened their diet to include other foods. This pattern of resource use is consistent with increased intraspecific compeition for food and similar to patterns of resource use between distinct species during food—lean times. A model for the evolution of the polymorphism is presented.",https://doi.org/10.2307/1938261,0
346,Resource Partitioning and Interspecific Competition in Two Two-Species Insular <i>Anolis</i> Lizard Communities,"Population experiments with Anolis lizard species demonstrate a relation between the amount of between-species competition and the degree of interspecific resource partitioning (the more the partitioning the less the competition). Specifically, the amount of resource partitioning between the two species (Anolis gingivinus and Anolis wattsi pogus) on the island of St. Maarten is less than that between the two species (Anolis bimaculatus and Anolis wattsi schwartzi) on the island of St. Eustatius. The presence of Anolis wattsi both lowers the growth rates and raises the perch heights of Anolis gingivinus individuals. In contrast, Anolis wattsi has no effect on Anolis bimaculatus. Thus, when there is less resource partitioning, Anolis wattsi has a greater competitive effect. This verifies, for these species, a central assumption of competition theory: the strength of between-species competition is inversely related to the amount of interspecific resource partitioning.",https://doi.org/10.1126/science.217.4558.444,0
347,"Resource Overlap, Prey Dynamics, and The Strength of Competition","Patterns of resource use and the strength of interspecific competition were explored for two temperate marine reef fishes, black surfperch (Embiotoca jacksoni) and striped surfperch (E. lateralis). These species occupy a depth—related gradient in abundance of food (crustaceans) and preferred foraging microhabitats (species of foliose algae that contain food items). Field experiments revealed that the intensity of competition varied greatly along the resource gradient. At the shallow end of the gradient, which contains seasonally high food levels and large amounts of the most preferred foraging microhabitat (the red alga Gelidium), interspecific competition was intense during seasons when food was scarce. This was accompanied by low overlap in use of feeding microhabitats. We detected no competition in deep areas that lacked Gelidium. In this portion of the resource gradient, low overlap occurred because there was no preferred microhabitat that both fishes could share. Low overlap in the deep habitat was not a consequence of competition but rather of the slightly different foraging adaptations of each species. In the surfperch system, static, among—habitat patterns of resource overlap provided little insight into the existence or strength of competition. High overlap occurred when competition was dampened by abundant food (in the shallow zone during food—rich seasons). Low overlap was either associated with strong competition (during periods of relative scarcity of food in the shallow zone) or its absence (deep areas which lacked the shared, preferred microhabitat). Spatial and temporal variation in the strength of interspecific competition was better predicted by dynamic (seasonal) patterns of microhabitat overlap, but only when coupled with knowledge of food dynamics, foraging adaptations of the competitors, and availability of preferred shared microhabitat.",https://doi.org/10.2307/1938124,0
348,Resource competition shapes biological rhythms and promotes temporal niche differentiation in a community simulation,"Competition for resources often contributes strongly to defining an organism's ecological niche. Endogenous biological rhythms are important adaptations to the temporal dimension of niches, but how other organisms influence such temporal niches has not been much studied, and the role of competition in particular has been even less examined. We investigated how interspecific competition and intraspecific competition for resources shape an organism's activity rhythms.To do this, we simulated communities of one or two species in an agent-based model. Individuals in the simulation move according to a circadian activity rhythm and compete for limited resources. Probability of reproduction is proportional to an individual's success in obtaining resources. Offspring may have variance in rhythm parameters, which allow for the population to evolve over time.We demonstrate that when organisms are arrhythmic, one species will always be competitively excluded from the environment, but the existence of activity rhythms allows niche differentiation and indefinite coexistence of the two species. Two species which are initially active at the same phase will differentiate their phase angle of entrainment over time to avoid each other. When only one species is present in an environment, competition within the species strongly selects for niche expansion through arrhythmicity, but the addition of an interspecific competitor facilitates evolution of increased rhythmic amplitude when combined with additional adaptations for temporal specialization. Finally, if individuals preferentially mate with others who are active at similar times of day, then disruptive selection by intraspecific competition can split one population into two reproductively isolated groups separated in activity time.These simulations suggest that biological rhythms are an effective method to temporally differentiate ecological niches and that competition is an important ecological pressure promoting the evolution of rhythms and sleep. This is the first study to use ecological modeling to examine biological rhythms.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.6770,0
349,Resource Competition: A Bifurcation Theory Approach,"We develop a framework for analysing the outcome of resource competition based on bifurcation theory. We elaborate our methodology by readdressing the problem of competition of two species for two resources in a chemostat environment. In the case of perfect-essential resources it has been extensively discussed using Tilman’s representation of resource quarter plane plots. Our mathematically rigorous analysis yields bifurcation diagrams with a striking similarity to Tilman’s method including the interpretation of the consumption vector and the resource supply vector. However, our approach is not restricted to a particular class of models but also works with other trophic interaction formulations. This is illustrated by the analysis of a model considering interactively-essential or complementary resources instead of prefect-essential resources. Additionally, our approach can also be used for other ecosystem compositions: multiple resources–multiple species communities with equilibrium or oscillatory dynamics. Hence, it gives not only a new interpretation of Tilman’s graphical approach, but it constitutes an extension of competition analyses to communities with many species as well as non-equilibrium dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1051/mmnp/20138611,0
350,Periodic temporal environmental variations induce coexistence in resource competition models,"Natural ecosystems, in particular on the microbial scale, are inhabited by a large number of species. The population size of each species is affected by interactions of individuals with each other and by spatial and temporal changes in environmental conditions, such as resource abundance. Here, we use a generic population dynamics model to study how, and under what conditions, a periodic temporal environmental variation can alter an ecosystem's composition and biodiversity. We demonstrate that using timescale separation allows one to qualitatively predict the long-term population dynamics of interacting species in varying environments. We show that the notion of Tilman's R* rule, a well-known principle that applies for constant environments, can be extended to periodically varying environments if the timescale of environmental changes (e.g., seasonal variations) is much faster than the timescale of population growth (doubling time in bacteria). When these timescales are similar, our analysis shows that a varying environment deters the system from reaching a steady state, and stable coexistence between multiple species becomes possible. Our results posit that biodiversity can in part be attributed to natural environmental variations.",https://doi.org/10.1103/physreve.108.034404,0
351,Competition and resource breadth shape niche variation and overlap in multiple trophic dimensions,"Competition plays a central role in the maintenance of biodiversity. A backbone of classic niche theory is that local coexistence of competitors is favoured by the contraction or divergence of species' niches. However, this effect should depend on the diversity of resources available in the local environment, particularly when resources vary in multiple ecological dimensions. Here, we investigated how available resource breadth (i.e. prey diversity) and competition together shape multidimensional niche variation (between and within individuals) and interspecific niche overlap in 42 populations of congeneric tropical frog species. We modelled realized niches in two key trophic dimensions (prey size and carbon stable isotopes) and sampled available food resources to quantify two-dimensional resource breadth. We found a 14-fold variation in multidimensional population niche width across populations, most of which was accounted for by within-individual diet variation. This striking variation was predicted by an interaction whereby individual niche breadth increased with resource breadth and decreased with the number of congeneric competitors. These ecological gradients also interact to influence the degree of niche overlap between species, which surprisingly decreased with population total niche width, providing novel insights on how similar species can coexist in local communities. Together, our results emphasize that patterns of exploitation of resources in multiple dimensions are driven by both competitive interactions and extrinsic factors such as local resource breadth.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2019.0369,0
352,INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION AND RESOURCE PULSE UTILIZATION IN A COLD DESERT COMMUNITY,"In desert ecosystems a large proportion of water and nitrogen is supplied in rain-induced pulses. It has been suggested that competitive interactions among desert plants would be most intense during these pulse periods of high resource availability. We tested this hypothesis with three cold desert shrub species of the Colorado Plateau (Gutierrezia sarothrae, Atriplex confertifolia, and Chrysothamnus nauseosus), which differ in their distribution of functional roots. In a three-year field study we conducted a neighbor removal experiment in conjunction with simulated 25-mm precipitation events and the addition of a nitrogen pulse in either spring or summer. We measured predawn water potential (Ψ), gas exchange, leaf δ15N, carbon isotope discrimination (Δ), and growth of target plants for the duration of the study. We found that G. sarothrae used resource pulses to a larger extent than A. confertifolia, which has more functional roots at depth. In all species, the addition of a water or nitrogen pulse did not significantly affect maximal rates of photosynthesis or branch growth. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, we did not find that pulse use was reduced by the presence of neighboring plants. Nevertheless, there was strong evidence for competitive interactions, which were more likely mediated by water at depth than by nitrogen. In the more deep-rooted species A. confertifolia, neighbor removal affected Ψ, gas exchange, Δ, percentage of carbon, and growth. G. sarothrae, which has a much smaller proportion of roots at depth, was less affected by the removal of neighboring shrubs, and not at all when only predominantly shallow-rooted herbaceous species were removed. These results suggest that shrubs in this cold desert community may primarily compete for water in deeper soil layers, where water depletion is slow and dominated by plant water uptake. There appeared to be little competition for water in shallow soil layers, where depletion is fast and dominated by evaporation.",https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[2602:icarpu]2.0.co;2,0
353,Resource limitation prevents the emergence of drug resistance by intensifying within-host competition,"Significance Antimicrobial drug resistance is set to kill millions in the coming decades. Finding new drugs is one solution, but might it also be possible to prevent the emergence of drug resistance in the first place? We show that the emergence of drug resistance can be prevented by reducing the availability of a nutrient for which drug-resistant parasites are especially hungry. Rather than killing parasites, this intervention works by harnessing ecological interactions: With resistant parasites struggling to replicate, susceptible parasites outcompete them before they can emerge.

Here, we demonstrate that phloem-feeding membracids (Publilia modesta) compete intraspecifically for the protective services of an ant mutualist (Formica altipetens). By experimentally increasing membracid densities in the field, we observed three negative effects due to competition for ants: (1) a 45%-59% reduction in the number of ants tending membracid aggregations, (2) a 63% increase in the abundance of a predatory salticid spider (Pellenes sp.), and (3) a 59% reduction in the mean number of membracid nymphs per plant. In total, the loss of protective services due to competition for mutualists translated into a 92% decrease in the production of newly eclosed membracid adults. These findings provide the first experimental demonstration that animal species compete for mutualists. In addition, our work indicates that mutualisms can be strongly influenced by the local biotic neighborhoods in which they occur and thus may be far more variable than previously thought.",https://doi.org/10.1086/285256,0

356,COMPETITION AMONG<i>EUCALYPTUS</i>TREES DEPENDS ON GENETIC VARIATION AND RESOURCE SUPPLY,"Genetic variation and environmental heterogeneity fundamentally shape the interactions between plants of the same species. According to the resource partitioning hypothesis, competition between neighbors intensifies as their similarity increases. Such competition may change in response to increasing supplies of limiting resources. We tested the resource partitioning hypothesis in stands of genetically identical (clone-origin) and genetically diverse (seed-origin) Eucalyptus trees with different water and nutrient supplies, using individual-based tree growth models. We found that genetic variation greatly reduced competitive interactions between neighboring trees, supporting the resource partitioning hypothesis. The importance of genetic variation for Eucalyptus growth patterns depended strongly on local stand structure and focal tree size. This suggests that spatial and temporal variation in the strength of species interactions leads to reversals in the growth rank of seed-origin and clone-origin trees. This study is one of the first to experimentally test the resource partitioning hypothesis for intergenotypic vs. intragenotypic interactions in trees. We provide evidence that variation at the level of genes, and not just species, is functionally important for driving individual and community-level processes in forested ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1890/07-1733.1,0
357,The Nutrient-Load Hypothesis: Patterns of Resource Limitation and Community Structure Driven by Competition for Nutrients and Light,"Resource competition theory predicts that the outcome of competition for two nutrients depends on the ratio at which these nutrients are supplied. Yet there is considerable debate whether nutrient ratios or absolute nutrient loads determine the species composition of phytoplankton and plant communities. Here we extend the classical resource competition model for two nutrients by including light as additional resource. Our results suggest the nutrient-load hypothesis, which predicts that nutrient ratios determine the species composition in oligotrophic environments, whereas nutrient loads are decisive in eutrophic environments. The underlying mechanism is that nutrient enrichment shifts the species interactions from competition for nutrients to competition for light, which favors the dominance of superior light competitors overshadowing all other species. Intermediate nutrient loads can generate high biodiversity through a fine-grained patchwork of two-species and three-species coexistence equilibria. Depending on the species traits, however, competition for nutrients and light may also produce multiple alternative stable states, suppressing the predictability of the species composition. The nutrient-load hypothesis offers a solution for several discrepancies between classical resource competition theory and field observations, explains why eutrophication often leads to diversity loss, and provides a simple conceptual framework for patterns of biodiversity and community structure observed in nature.",https://doi.org/10.1086/665650,0
358,Does the relative importance of resource competition and architectural effect in floral variation vary with stages of floral ontogeny?,"Abstract Variation in floral allocation within inflorescences has been attributed to resource competition and/or architectural effect. The two hypotheses were extensively studied and both hypotheses were partly supported by previous studies. However, the relative importance of resource competition and architectural effect may vary with stages of floral ontogeny in a species. To detect the effects of ontogenetic stages on floral variation, we manipulated the 6‐flowered inflorescences of Adenophora jasionifolia (Campanulaceae) by early, late, and non‐thinning flowers. Our results indicated that pollen and ovule production of the remaining flowers were not significantly different between early and late thinning manipulations, suggesting that floral sex allocation was determined far before flowering, in support of the architectural effect hypothesis. Under hand‐pollination treatments, early thinning but not late thinning resulted in a significant increase in seed number and seed set of the remaining flowers. Therefore, the increase in seed production of the remaining flowers related to the floral ontogeny. The resource competition for floral allocation was significant under early thinning rather than late thinning manipulation. Our results suggest that studies on floral variation within inflorescences should take into account the stages of floral ontogeny.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1759-6831.2011.00175.x,0
359,"Unusual positional effects on flower sex in an andromonoecious tree: Resource competition, architectural constraints, or inhibition by the apical flower?","PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Two, nonmutually exclusive, mechanisms—competition for resources and architectural constraints—have been proposed to explain the proximal to distal decline in flower size, mass, and/or femaleness in indeterminate, elongate inflorescences. Whether these mechanisms also explain unusual positional effects such as distal to proximal declines of floral performance in determinate inflorescences, is understudied. METHODS: We tested the relative influence of these mechanisms in the andromonoecious wild olive tree, where hermaphroditic flowers occur mainly on apical and the most proximal positions in determinate inflorescences. We experimentally increased the availability of resources for the inflorescences by removing half of the inflorescences per twig or reduced resource availability by removing leaves. We also removed the apical flower to test its inhibitory effect on subapical flowers. KEY RESULTS: The apical flower had the highest probability of being hermaphroditic. Further down, however, the probability of finding a hermaphroditic flower decreased from the base to the tip of the inflorescences. An experimental increase of resources increased the probability of finding hermaphroditic flowers at each position, and vice versa. Removal of the apical flower increased the probability of producing hermaphroditic flowers in proximal positions but not in subapical positions. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate an interaction between resource competition and architectural constraints in influencing the arrangement of the hermaphroditic and male flowers within the inflorescences of the wild olive tree. Subapical flowers did not seem to be hormonally suppressed by apical flowers. The study of these unusual positional effects is needed for a general understanding about the functional implications of inflorescence architecture.",https://doi.org/10.3732/ajb.1600433,0
360,"Resource use of crucian carp along a lake productivity gradient is related to body size, predation risk, and resource competition","Abstract Generalist fish species can feed on a wide resource spectrum and across trophic levels depending on resource availability and trophic interactions. Crucian carp ( Carassius carassius ) represents a good candidate species to investigate variation in the trophic ecology of generalist fish as it can be found in highly variable fish communities and its resource use is well documented. In this study, we explored the trophic ecology of crucian carp at the individual and population levels using stable isotope and gut content analysis. We tested if trophic resource use varied according to lake productivity, predation risk, intra‐ and interspecific competition, or individual fish size. We found that crucian carp resource preference was highly variable among and within lakes. In predator‐free lakes, small crucian carp occurred in high densities, showed increased interindividual specialisation, and relied mainly on pelagic zooplankton. In presence of predators, large crucian carp occurred in low densities and included greater proportions of benthic macroinvertebrates in their diet. This shift in resource use was further favoured in productive, shallow lakes where littoral prey were probably abundant. Resource partitioning was an important factor determining crucian carp niche use, as fish had higher trophic position in absence of other cyprinids. Crucian carp showed highly dynamic resource use and food preferences in response to variable environmental conditions. Overlooking complex diet preferences of generalist fish may lead to an oversimplification of freshwater community dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1111/eff.12668,0
361,Secondary production and diet of an invasive snail in freshwater wetlands: implications for resource utilization and competition,"Invasive species can monopolize resources and thus dominate ecosystem production. In this study we estimated secondary production and diet of four populations of Pomacea canaliculata, a freshwater invasive snail, in wetlands (abandoned paddy, oxbow pond, drainage channel, and river meander) in monsoonal Hong Kong (lat. 22°N). Apple snail secondary production (ash-free dry mass [AFDM]) ranged from 165.9 to 233.3 g m−2 year−1, and varied between seasons. Production was lower during the cool dry northeast monsoon, when water temperatures might have limited growth, but fast growth and recruitment of multiple cohorts were possible throughout much (7–10 months) of the year and especially during the warm, wet southwest monsoon. The diet, as revealed by stomach-content analysis, consisted mainly of detritus and macrophytes, and was broadly consistent among habitats despite considerable variation in the composition and cover of aquatic plants. Apple snail annual production was >10 times greater than production estimates for other benthic macroinvertebrates in Hong Kong (range 0.004–15 g AFDM m−2 year−1, n = 29). Furthermore, annual production estimates for three apple snail populations (i.e. >230 g AFDM m−2 year−1) were greater than published estimates for any other freshwater snails (range 0.002–194 g AFDM m−2 year−1, n = 33), regardless of climatic regime or habitat type. High production by P. canaliculata in Hong Kong was attributable to the topical climate (annual mean ~24°C), permitting rapid growth and repeated reproduction, together with dietary flexibility including an ability to consume a range of macrophytes. If invasive P. canaliculata can monopolize food resources, its high productivity indicates potential for competition with other macroinvertebrate primary consumers. Manipulative experiments will be needed to quantify these impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem function in wetlands, combined with management strategies to prevent further range extension by P. canaliculata.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10530-009-9537-x,0
362,"Teasing apart plant community responses to N enrichment: the roles of resource limitation, competition and soil microbes","Abstract Although ecologists have documented the effects of nitrogen enrichment on productivity, diversity and species composition, we know little about the relative importance of the mechanisms driving these effects. We propose that distinct aspects of environmental change associated with N enrichment (resource limitation, asymmetric competition, and interactions with soil microbes) drive different aspects of plant response. We test this in greenhouse mesocosms, experimentally manipulating each factor across three ecosystems: tallgrass prairie, alpine tundra and desert grassland. We found that resource limitation controlled productivity responses to N enrichment in all systems. Asymmetric competition was responsible for diversity declines in two systems. Plant community composition was impacted by both asymmetric competition and altered soil microbes, with some contributions from resource limitation. Results suggest there may be generality in the mechanisms of plant community change with N enrichment. Understanding these links can help us better predict N response across a wide range of ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12665,0
363,Interspecific Resource Competition Effects on Fisheries Revenue,"In many fisheries multiple species are simultaneously caught while stock assessments and fishing quota are defined at species level. Yet species caught together often share habitat and resources, resulting in interspecific resource competition. The consequences of resource competition on population dynamics and revenue of simultaneously harvested species has received little attention due to the historical single stock approach in fisheries management. Here we present the results of a modelling study on the interaction between resource competition of sole (Solea solea) and slaice (Pleuronectus platessa) and simultaneous harvesting of these species, using a stage-structured population model. Three resources were included of which one is shared with a varied competition intensity. We find that plaice is the better competitor of the two species and adult plaice are more abundant than adult sole. When competition is high sole population biomass increases with increasing fishing effort prior to plaice extinction. As a result of this increase in the sole population, the revenue of the stocks combined as function of effort becomes bimodal with increasing resource competition. When considering a single stock quota for sole, its recovery with increasing effort may result in even more fishing effort that would drive the plaice population to extinction. When sole and plaice compete for resources the highest revenue is obtained at effort levels at which plaice is extinct. Ignoring resource competition promotes overfishing due to increasing stock of one species prior to extinction of the other species. Consequently, efforts to mitigate the decline in one species will not be effective if increased stock in the other species leads to increased quota. If a species is to be protected against extinction, management should not only be directed at this one species, but all species that compete with it for resource as well.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0053352,0
364,"Interactions Among the Effects of Herbivory, Competition, and Resource Limitation on Chaparral Herbs","Older chaparral stands are frequently characterized by gaps in the canopy and by a lack of herbaceous vegetation in these openings. Many causes for the lack of herb growth in gaps have been postulated, including lack of seeds in the soil, limited nutrients and water, competition with shrubs for resources, interference competition (i.e., allelopathy), and herbivory. An experiment was conducted to assess the individual and combined effects of four main factors (trenching to reduce root competition, caging to reduce herbivory, nutrient addition, and water addition) on herb germination, survival, and growth in chaparral dominated by chamise, Adenostoma fasciculatum. We found strong interactions among these treatments. Therefore, no single factor can be regarded as causing the absence of herbs in chaparral. Herb establishment was limited by herbivory and root competition with shrubs for limited nutrients and/or water. Survival was enhanced by trenching, caging, and water. Growth was enhanced by nutrient addition, but the magnitude of this nutrient effect became appreciable only within trenched, caged plots. The vegetative cover of annual herbs in gaps was limited by the combined effects of herbivory, competition with the roots of shrubs, inadequate nutrients, and inadequate water.",https://doi.org/10.2307/1938906,0
365,Resource competition in contour hedgerow intercropping systems involving different shrub species with mature and young tea on sloping highlands in Sri Lanka,"Tea ( Camellia sinensis ) in Sri Lanka is grown predominantly on sloping highlands. Incorporating trees as hedgerows along contours is aimed at reducing erosion and improving soil fertility through addition of prunings as mulch. However, there could be significant competition for essential growth resources between the hedgerows and tea. The primary objective of this study was to determine the influence of six hedgerow species ( Calliandra calothyrsus , Senna [ Cassia ] spectabilis , Eupatorium inulifolium , Flemingia congesta , Gliricidia sepium and Tithonia diversifolia ) on mature (6-year-old) and young (6-month-old) tea. This study had three on-farm, long-term (from Nov 1998 to Dec 2002) field experiments. Experiment 1 had 12 treatment combinations with the six shrub species and two mulching treatments (i.e. hedgerow prunings added to the tea plot as a mulch, and unmulched) on mature tea plus a sole tea crop as control. The same was repeated on young tea in Experiment 2 to determine whether resource competition on young tea was greater than that on mature tea. Experiment 3 examined the effects of removing tree root competition on tea by cutting a 1-m deep trench between hedgerows and tea. In all experiments, total tea yields of hedgerow intercrops, cumulated over the 50-month experimental period, were significantly lower (by 3–50%) than sole tea crops, thus indicating significant resource competition except in the case of mulched hedgerow systems involving Eupatorium and mature tea (18% yield increase). Removal of below-ground competition significantly increased tea yields by 11–19%. Addition of hedgerow prunings as a mulch significantly increased yields of both mature and young tea by 13–21%. Tea yields of hedgerow systems with Calliandra , Flemingia and Eupatorium showed greater yield reductions in young tea than in mature tea, but the opposite was shown with other hedgerow species. There was a significant negative linear relationship between tea yield and pruned biomass of hedgerows. Tea yields of all experiments showed significant negative correlations with several hedgerow characters, which are indicators of their competitive ability. These included hedgerow root density, canopy lateral spread, height and cross-section. In a majority of hedgerow systems, the available phosphorus content of topsoil (0–20 cm depth) was up to 51% lower compared to sole crops. It is concluded that incorporation of contour hedgerows in to an existing tea crop could result in significant resource competition with tea and thereby cause tea yield to decrease. However, there is scope for selection of hedgerow species that minimize competition through spatial and temporal complementarity with tea in resource capture.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0021859605005563,0
366,"Elephants for Africa: male Savannah elephant <i>Loxodonta africana</i> sociality, the Makgadikgadi and resource competition","The resurgence of the Boteti River, at the western border of the Makgadikgadi Pans National Park (MPNP), has had a large influence on the importance of this area in the framework of ecosystem conservation in Botswana and, in particular, for the movement of elephants into historical rangelands. The River represents a hard border to the MPNP and community lands to the east. Cultural knowledge about how to deal with elephants is deficient because of the lack of recent exposure to this species, aggravating the issues in the region. Working towards human–elephant coexistence, Elephants for Africa's research focuses on the social and ecological requirements of male Savannah elephants Loxodonta africana , alongside those of the human population, and applies this in the context of human–wildlife resource competition in the region. Strong partnerships with the communities bordering the MPNP and engaging a local non‐governmental organization board of experts to guide our work are the foundation of evolving working solutions to decrease the socio‐economic impacts of living alongside elephants.

367,Resource competition can explain simplicity in microbial community assembly,"Abstract Predicting the composition and diversity of communities is a central goal in ecology. While community assembly is considered hard to predict, laboratory microcosms often follow a simple assembly rule based on the outcome of pairwise competitions. This assembly rule predicts that a species that is excluded by another species in pairwise competition cannot survive in a multispecies community with that species. Despite the empirical success of this bottom-up prediction, its mechanistic origin has remained elusive. In this study, we elucidate how this simple pattern in community assembly can emerge from resource competition. Our geometric analysis of a consumer-resource model shows that trio community assembly is always predictable from pairwise outcomes when one species grows faster than another species on every resource. We also identify all possible trio assembly outcomes under three resources and find that only two outcomes violate the assembly rule. Simulations demonstrate that pairwise competitions accurately predict trio assembly with up to 100 resources and the assembly of larger communities containing up to twelve species. We then further demonstrate accurate quantitative prediction of community composition using harmonic mean of pairwise fractions. Finally, we show that cross-feeding between species does not decrease assembly rule prediction accuracy. Our findings highlight that simple community assembly can emerge even in ecosystems with complex underlying dynamics. Significance Multispecies microbial communities play an essential role in the health of ecosystems ranging from the ocean to the human gut. A major challenge in microbial ecology is to understand and predict which species can coexist within a community. While a simple empirical rule utilizing only pairwise outcomes successfully predicts multispecies laboratory communities, its mechanistic origin has remained unexplained. Here, we find that the observed simplicity can emerge from competition for resources. Using a generic consumer-resource model, we demonstrate that community assembly of highly complex ecosystems is nevertheless well predicted by pairwise competitions. Our results argue that community assembly can be surprisingly simple despite the potential complexity associated with competition and crossfeeding of many different resources by many different species.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.13.544752,0
368,Foraging activity of roving herbivorous reef fish (Acanthuridae and Scaridae) in eastern Brazil: influence of resource availability and interference competition,"Foraging activity of roving herbivorous reef fish (RHs) from families Acanthuridae (surgeonfish; three species) and Scaridae (parrotfish; five species), and its relationship to resource availability and interference competition, was studied in the largest South Atlantic Reef complex (Abrolhos Bank, eastern Brazil). Observations were undertaken at four sites differing in resource availability and competitors' abundance (i.e. RHs and territorial herbivores from genus Stegastes ). Turf algae (TA) were selected by most species in most sites, while other food items were generally avoided. Surgeonfish had higher feeding rates than parrotfish, the former grazing more frequently on fleshy algae (FA) and the latter on crustose calcareous algae (CCA). Both surgeonfish and parrotfish interacted agonistically most frequently with damselfish, followed by confamilial interactions. Despite these consistent patterns, feeding rates, food selection and frequency of agonistic interactions differed significantly between sites for most species. Bite rates on CCA and FA were disproportionally higher in sites where such items were more available, leading to significant spatial variation in grazing selectivity (i.e. positive rather than negative selection of CCA and ‘lower avoidance’ of FA). Although agonistic interactions were more frequent at sites where herbivorous fish (both roving and territorial) were most abundant, there was no clear relationship between interference competition and foraging patterns. These results indicate that the scarcity of other food may induce RHs to consume the dominant resources. They also support the hypotheses that RHs are unable to clear large tracts of reef surface of FA once these have proliferated, and that territorial herbivores do not limit the access of RHs to particular resources.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0025315409991147,0
369,Fusarium Crown Rot of Winter Wheat Influenced by Resource Competition Near a Tree Windbreak,"Fusarium crown rot becomes most severe when wheat is stressed for water near the time of anthesis. This research examined the potential to study crown rot in the gradient of resource competition near a tree windbreak. Winter wheat was planted for 2 years into a field infested by Fusarium pseudograminearum and bordered by 17-m-high Austrian pines. Crown rot, plant growth and yield, and soil water content were evaluated at six distances (5 to 46 m) perpendicular to the tree line in strip plots inoculated or not inoculated with the pathogen. Crown rot was minor (&lt;5% whiteheads) in noninoculated strips and greater in inoculated strips (26 to 35%) in a 21-m zone from 9 to 30 m from the tree line (0.5–1.8 times the tree height; 0.5–1.8H). At 46 m (2.7H), crown rot was similar in noninoculated and inoculated strips (2 to 5% whiteheads). Whiteheads and culm browning were roughly the reverse of soil water depletion by tree roots. Grain yield at 23 m compared with 46 m was reduced by 33 to 35% in noninoculated plots and by 43 to 49% in inoculated plots. It is possible to study associations between water stress and Fusarium crown rot in the zone of resource competition near windbreaks.",https://doi.org/10.1094/pdis-01-19-0213-re,0
370,Resource competition and apparent competition in declining mule deer (<i>Odocoileus</i> <i>hemionus</i>),"Resource competition and apparent competition have both been suggested as the cause of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus (Rafinesque, 1817)) decline concurrent with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmerman, 1780)) increase. I tested for both hypotheses by conducting a “press” and “release” experiment in a mule deer, white-tailed deer, and cougar (Puma concolor (L., 1771)) community. If resource competition is causal, then predation should decrease, but other sources of mortality should increase following increased mortality of cougars and release of competing white-tailed deer. If apparent competition is causal, then predation should decrease and mule deer should increase following increased mortality of cougars and release of white-tailed deer. I accepted the apparent competition hypothesis because high mortality of female cougars and cougar population decline was associated with both white-tailed deer and mule deer population growth. Very high mortality of female cougars appeared to result in mule deer population recovery. However, high mortality of male cougars (with increased male immigration) preceding high female mortality appeared to result in sexually segregated prey-switching by females with cubs from abundant white-tailed deer to rare mule deer to avoid sexually selected infanticide. High mortality of resident male cougars may have precipitated the mule deer decline in the first place.",https://doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2016-0109,0
371,A graphical theory of competition on spatial resource gradients,"Ecology Letters (2011) 14: 220–228 Resource competition is a fundamental interaction in natural communities. However, little remains known about competition in spatial environments where organisms are able to regulate resource distributions. Here, we analyse the competition of two consumers for two resources in a one-dimensional habitat in which the resources are supplied from opposite sides. We show that the success of an invading species crucially depends on the slope of the resource gradients shaped by the resident. Our analysis reveals that parameter combinations, which lead to coexistence in a uniform environment, may favour alternative stable states in a spatial system, and vice versa. Furthermore, differences in growth rate, mortality or dispersal abilities allow a consumer to coexist stationarily with – or even outcompete – a competitor with lower resource requirements. Applying our theory to a phytoplankton model, we explain shifts in the community structure that are induced by environmental changes.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01574.x,0
372,Competition between foliar Neotyphodium lolii endophytes and mycorrhizal Glomus spp. fungi in Lolium perenne depends on resource supply and host carbohydrate content,"1. Cool-season grasses can be simultaneously infected by foliar fungal endophytes and colonised by mycorrhizal fungi, the integrated functions of which are strong predictors of plant fitness within grassland ecosystems. Evidence has been presented previously that infection of grass species with foliar endophytes can negatively affect mycorrhizal colonisation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that mycorrhizal colonisation in turn adversely affects Neotyphodium endophyte concentrations and that the competitive interaction between the two endosymbionts is affected by resource supply. 2. Specifically, we report how competition between Glomus (G. mosseae– GM, G. intraradices– GI) mycorrhizal fungi and N. lolii (common strain (CS) and AR1) foliar endophytic strains is affected by P supply and water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content in two Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) cultivars: a high sugar grass, AberDart, and a conventional (control) grass, Fennema. 3. The presence of Glomus mycorrhizae reduced the concentrations of endophytes and alkaloids in leaf blades and pseudostems. The reduction depended on P supply, ryegrass cultivar (notably WSC content) and endophyte strain. Conversely, foliar endophyte infection reduced mycorrhizal colonisation rates and concentrations in the roots of the control cultivar Fennema, although not in the high sugar cultivar, AberDart. 4. Neither GM nor N. lolii infection had an effect per se on the yield of root or blade compared with mycorrhiza-free (M-) and endophyte-free (E-) plants, respectively; though, yield of roots and blades was reduced by GI infection and at low P. 5. Competitive interactions between ecologically widespread foliar endophytes (valuable for plant protection) and mycorrhizal endosymbionts (valuable for P acquisition) as seen in this study are of critical importance especially in areas of high pest prevalence and low P availability. Our work stresses the need for elucidating the physiological/metabolic basis for such interactions between endosymbionts to understand how these processes contribute to plant performance and fitness in grassland ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01853.x,0
373,Seasonal adjustment of sex ratio and offspring masculinity by female deer mice is inconsistent with the local resource competition hypothesis,"Background: Natural selection is expected to favour the dispersing sex when one sex has a greater tendency to disperse and resources are limited, i.e. during periods of high population density. This is termed the local resource competition hypothesis. Among deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, males are more likely to disperse than females. The masculinity of male deer mice can also affect the probability of their dispersal. ‘Masculinity’ is a continuous variable compounded from a suite of traits associated with being male (i.e. hormones, behaviours, morphology, life history). Hypothesis: Female deer mice will produce male-biased sex ratios and more masculinized offspring when population density (and thus local resource competition) is high. Methods: We investigated cohort sex ratio and population density in P. maniculatus during the breeding season of 16 consecutive years. Population density was the surrogate for local resource competition and was measured once every two weeks. We measured masculinity as ano-genital distance (AGD), which is a common measurement of masculinity in mammals and a correlate of testosterone levels, in 6-day-old wild P. maniculatus offspring during the breeding season (May through August) of 2011 and investigated whether masculinity was correlated with population density in a manner consistent with local resource competition. Results: Sex ratio did not correlate as predicted with local resource competition; females produced more female-biased litters when density was high. However, maternal adjustments to masculinity did correlate with litter sex ratio, suggesting that sex ratio and masculinity might covary in response to some selection pressure other than local population density.",,0
374,Resource capture and use by tropical forest tree seedlings and their consequences for competition,"All plants need the same resources (water, light and nutrients) for their survival, growth and reproduction. Paradoxically, water is a limiting resource in many tropical rain forests. Variation in community structure, composition and functioning is driven to a large extent by variation in rainfall (Medina 1999; Poorter et al. 2004). Species composition changes continuously and gradually along the rainfall gradient (Hall & Swaine 1981; Bongers et al. 1999; Bongers et al. 2004), and within forests species tend to sort out along slope gradients in water availability (van Rompaey 1993; Webb & Peart 2000; Harms et al. 2001). Within a given forest a range of species coexist that differ in their drought tolerance. These species face to a greater or lesser extent a bottleneck during the dry season, when water is in short supply. Seasonal droughts (with low soil matric potentials) occur annually in tropical moist forest and occasionally in tropical wet forest (Veenendaal et al. 1996a). Even in seemingly aseasonal wet forests dry periods of 15–30 days may occur every other year (Walsh & Newbery 1999).",https://doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511541971.003,0

From 1993 to 1998 we collected 300 composite samples of sedge (Carex aquatilis and Carex spp.), willow (Salix arctica), legume (Oxytropis spp. and Astragalus spp.), and avens (Dryas integrifolia). Samples were collected in mid-June (start of the growing season), mid-July (peak of the growing season), mid-late August (senescence), and early (November), mid- (February), and late- (April/May) winter. We analysed forages for percent digestibility (in vitro acid-pepsin dry matter digestibility), crude protein (CP), fibre, lignin, and energy content. There was significant inter-annual variation in levels of lignin, fibre, and energy, and significant intra-annual (seasonal) variation for all quality measures and forages, which reflected the strong difference in quality between summer and winter.

376,The Causes of Resource Monopolization: Interaction Between Resource Dispersion and Mode of Competition,"Abstract The degree of monopolization of resources is thought to be higher in groups that compete by interference than by exploitation. However, the monopolization of resources will presumably depend on (1) whether the dispersion of resources is economically defendable, and (2) whether some competitors have the ability to defend these resource distributions and hence capitalize on this potential. We tested for an interaction between the effects of temporal resource dispersion and aggressiveness on the degree of resource monopolization in a foraging system. Two species of fish differing markedly in aggressiveness (high: convict cichlids, Archocentrus nigrofasciatus ; low: goldfish, Carrasius auratus ) were allowed to compete intra‐specifically in groups of four for food that was either potentially defendable (arrived asynchronously) or not (arrived synchronously). As predicted, the monopolization of food, measured as the coefficient of variation of food eaten within groups, was significantly higher in the defendable than in the undefendable treatment for convict cichlids but not for goldfish. However, the monopolization of food was higher in the non‐aggressive goldfish than in the aggressive convict cichlids. Future studies should quantify and compare the monopolization in species that compete primarily via scramble competition to those that use primarily resource defence.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0310.2003.00948.x,0
377,Separating the effects of air and soil temperature on silver birch. Part I. Does soil temperature or resource competition determine the timing of root growth?,"The aboveground parts of boreal forest trees mostly grow earlier, and the roots later, in the growing season. We aimed to experimentally test whether the extrinsic driver of soil temperature or the intrinsic driver (resource competition between plant parts) is a more important control for the root and shoot growth of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) seedlings. Sixteen two-year-old seedlings were grown in controlled environment rooms for two simulated growing seasons (GS1, GS2). In GS1, all the seedlings were acclimatized under the same conditions, but in GS2, the soil temperature treatments were: (i) constant 10 °C (Cool); (ii) constant 18 °C (Warm); (iii) early growing season at 10 °C, switched to 18 °C later (Early Cool Late Warm, ECLW) and (iv) early growing season 18 °C, switched to 10 °C later (Early Warm Late Cool, EWLC). The treatments did not affect growth allocation between shoots and roots. Warm soil benefitted shoot elongation as it slowed down in EWLC and accelerated in ECLW after the soil temperature switch. However, whole-tree biomasses were similar to Cool and the seedlings grew largest in Warm. Phenology was not strongly affected by soil temperature, and root and shoot growth did not usually peak simultaneously. Short root mortality increased strongly in ECLW and decreased in EWLC after the soil temperature switch. Long root longevity was not significantly affected but long root growth ceased earliest in ECLW. Soil warming increased foliar nutrient contents. Growth dynamics were not solely driven by soil temperature, but resource competition also played a significant role. The study showed the importance of soil temperature for fine root dynamics not only through root growth but also via root mortality, as soil warming increased mortality even more than growth. Soil temperature has complex effects on tree and soil functioning, which further affects carbon dynamics in forest ecosystems that have a climate feedback.",https://doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpac092,0
378,How topography and neighbor shape the fate of trees in subtropical forest restoration: Environmental filtering and resource competition drive natural regeneration,"The structure of plant communities at local scales depends on both the spatial heterogeneity of abiotic environmental factors and the biotic interactions within the community. However, although environmental filtering due to microtopographic heterogeneity and resource competition among plants caused by spatial variation in tree density and size are considered to be very important in explaining the mechanisms of community assembly, their effects on the processes of individual mortality and recruitment in natural forest regeneration, as well as their relative contributions, are still poorly understood. To address this, we established a 12-ha permanent plot in a subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest area and measured microtopographic variables such as elevation, slope, aspect, and TPI using a total station. We monitored the individual mortality and recruitment in forest natural regeneration through repeated surveys at 5-year intervals. We fitted spatial covariance models to jointly use multiple factors from three groups of variables (microtopographic effect, neighborhood density effects, neighborhood size effects) as explanatory variables to analyze their roles in driving the mortality and recruitment of all individual and 12 dominant species in forest natural regeneration at the neighborhood scale. Our results show that: (1) In the crucial early stages of secondary forest restoration, natural regeneration is influenced by a synergy of environmental filtering, due to microtopographic heterogeneity, and resource competition among plants. (2) For distinct species responses, evergreen dominant species' mortality is largely explained by neighborhood effects, while deciduous species are more affected by topographic factors. Furthermore, the adverse effects of larger conspecific trees on younger trees indicate a pattern of competitive pressure leading to mortality among regenerating trees, such pattern emphasis the influence of parent trees on natural regeneration. (3) As trees grow, their interaction with these stressors evolves, suggesting a shift in their resource acquisition strategies and response to neighborhood effects and environmental factors. Despite these changes, the relative importance of topographic factors in determining survival and recruitment success remains constant. This research highlights the importance of considering both environmental and neighborhood effects in forest management, particularly in early secondary forest restoration.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fecs.2024.100169,0
379,Variation in resource competition traits among <i>Microcystis</i> strains is affected by their microbiomes,"Abstract Freshwater harmful algal blooms are often dominated by Microcystis , a phylogenetically cohesive group of cyanobacteria marked by extensive genetic and physiological diversity. We have previously shown that this genetic diversity and the presence of a microbiome of heterotrophic bacteria influences competitive interactions with eukaryotic phytoplankton. In this study, we sought to explain these observations by characterizing Monod equation parameters for resource usage (maximum growth rate μ max , half‐saturation value for growth K s, and quota) as a function of N and P levels for four strains (NIES‐843, PCC 9701, PCC 7806 [WT], and PCC 7806 Δ mcyB ) in presence and absence of a microbiome derived from Microcystis isolated from Lake Erie. Results indicated limited differences in maximum growth rates but more pronounced differences in half‐saturation values among Microcystis strains. The largest impact of the microbiome was reducing the minimal nitrogen concentration sustaining growth and reducing half saturation values, with variable results depending on the Microcystis strain. Microcystis strains also differed from each other in their N and P quotas and the extent to which microbiome presence affected them. Our data highlight the importance of the microbiome in altering Microcystis ‐intrinsic traits, strain competitive hierarchies, and thus bloom dynamics. As quota, μ max , and K s are commonly used in models for harmful algal blooms, our data suggest that model improvement may be possible by incorporating genotype dependencies of resource‐use parameters.",https://doi.org/10.1002/mlf2.12094,0
380,Food resource competition between African wild dogs and larger carnivores in an ecosystem with artificial water provision,"Abstract Predators of similar size often compete over prey. In semi‐arid ecosystems where water is a limiting resource, prey availability can be affected by water distribution, which further increases resource competition and exacerbate conflict among predators. This can have implications for carnivore dietary competition. Hence, we evaluated the dynamics of food resource competition between African wild dogs and four competing predators (cheetahs, leopards, lions and spotted hyaenas) in different seasons and across areas with different waterhole densities in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. We used the frequency of occurrence of prey items found in predators' scats to analyse diet composition, overlap and prey preference. For most predators, kudu was most frequently consumed and preferred. Low and medium water‐dependent prey (medium and small‐sized) were mostly consumed by wild dogs, leopards and cheetahs. Wild dog diet overlap was high with all predators, particularly with hyaenas and lions. There were no seasonal differences in the predators diet. The diet overlap of wild dogs with lions was highest in the low waterhole density area, and wild dog diet composition did not differ significantly from the diet of lions and hyaenas. In the low waterhole density area, wild dogs and hyaenas broadened their niche breadth, and predators diet had a higher proportion of low water‐dependent prey. A low density of waterholes increased food resource competition. However, high density of waterholes, where there is more prey availability, can increase the aggregation and density of predators, and hence, increase the risks involved in interspecific competition on wild dogs. To reduce food resource competition on wild dogs, we propose to conserve larger‐bodied prey that are less dependent on water (e.g. kudu, reedbuck, eland and gemsbok). As the use of water pumping is common practice, we propose maintaining water management heterogeneity where prey which is less dependent on water can also thrive.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.11141,0
381,Assessing the potential for resource competition between the Kerguelen Plateau fisheries and southern elephant seals,"Indirect ecological interactions such as competition for resources between fisheries and marine predators have often been proposed but can be difficult to demonstrate empirically. The Kerguelen Plateau in the Southern Indian Ocean supports fisheries for both Patagonian toothfish and mackerel icefish and is also an important foraging ground for several avian and mammalian predators, including the southern elephant seal. We quantified the spatio-temporal use of the plateau by southern elephant seals and found that males and females spent 30% of their time on the plateau within the commonly used fishing grounds, indicating the possibility of competition for resources there. We then contrasted the seals’ use of two habitat types, the benthos (where interactions with the long-line fisheries are most likely) and the epi-pelagic zone. The likelihood of feeding on the benthos declined as ocean depth increased and was also less likely at night. Males were also more likely to feed on the benthos than females. The sub-adult male seals consumed an estimated 6,814 – 14,848 tons of high energy content prey (including toothfish) and females 7,085 – 18,037 tons from the plateau during the post-molt winter months. For males this represented 79.6 - 173.4% of the mean annual catch by the Kerguelen fishery compared to 82.8 - 210.7% for adult females. When considering the seals consumption of fish from the benthos within the fishing grounds these estimates decreased to 3.6 - 15.1% of the fishery’s total annual catch for females and 7.8 - 19.1% for males. While this further indicates the possibility of indirect ecological interactions (with the fishery taking more fish than the seals), the lack of detailed diet information for the seals precludes us from establishing the degree or nature of the possible interactions because the importance of toothfish and icefish in the diet of the seals is unknown. However, the unique life history and highly polygynous nature of this species, and the lack of evidence of a measurable effect on either the seal’s population growth rates or the catch per unit of the fishery, suggest that any indirect ecological interactions are not of sufficient magnitude to affect either the seal population or the fishery.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.1006120,0
382,"Variation in the Strength of Interference Competition with Resource Density in Blackbirds, Turdus merula","The decline in feeding rate of single blackbirds when feeding with one or two competitors was measured over a range of prey densities, in two winters, to determine whether the degree of interference competition experienced by an individual was independent of resource density. Individual wild blackbirds feeding with one or two competitors in experimental patches suffered high interference competition in both winters. In the absence of interactions (any observable despotic behaviour) there was no significant variation in the degree of interference competition with prey density in either winter. However, in the presence of interactions (an incident of chasing or being chased by a conspecific while feeding) there was significant variation in the degree of interference competition with prey density: interference competition peaked at mid-prey densities in both winters.",https://doi.org/10.2307/3546477,0
383,Sex-specific strategies of resource allocation in response to competition for light in a dioecious plant,"The differential plasticity hypothesis suggests that sexual dimorphism in dioecious plants could evolve in response to sex-specific resource requirements for reproduction (i.e., high carbon requirements for ovules and high nitrogen demands for pollen). When resources become limiting during growth, males and females should, therefore, adjust their allocation to resource-harvesting organs differently. To investigate the potential for plants to respond to resource limitation late in life and to test the differential plasticity hypothesis, we grew male and female individuals of the annual wind-pollinated plant Mercurialis annua in a common garden. Late in the growth season, we simulated a change in competition by decreasing plant density in half of the replicates. We measured both allocation to vegetative and reproductive traits and analyzed the relative allocation to reproduction vs. growth. Males and females differentially adjusted their resource allocation in response to varying plant densities, despite the fact that they were reproductively mature. Males maintained the same relative allocation of resource to reproductive vs. vegetative tissues at both densities. In contrast, females reduced vegetative growth proportionally less than seed production at the higher density. Our results highlight the dynamic nature of allocation decisions taken by plants, which respond quickly and in a sexually dimorphic way to changes in their competitive circumstances. The existence of resource 'currencies' limiting male and female functions differently have potentially led to the evolution of sex-specific strategies of resource acquisition and deployment, with females conserving resources for vegetative organs to ensure their future carbon-rich reproduction.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-017-3966-5,0
384,"Stoichiometrically Explicit Competition between Grazers: Species Replacement, Coexistence, and Priority Effects along Resource Supply Gradients","Assuming key trade‐offs among interactors, several models (resource ratio, keystone predation, intraguild predation) predict changes in species composition over resource supply gradients. Ecological stoichiometry could also predict compositional shifts of grazers over gradients of nutrient and light supply through a mechanism involving (mis)matches between elemental body composition of grazers and plants. This hypothesis is explored here using a suite of two‐grazer, one‐plant models that incorporate three key components: plant production depends on light and nutrients, nutrient content of plants can vary, and homeostatic grazers can be carbon or nutrient limited. The results from this suite closely resemble the classical resource ratio model describing plant competition for two resources. Here, the models predict shifts of grazer composition along resource supply gradients if species trade off competitive abilities for plant carbon and nutrients. Given this trade‐off, superior nutrient competitors should dominate low nutrient environments, and superior carbon competitors should dominate high nutrient environments. At intermediate nutrient supply, species can coexist at a stable equilibrium, or alternative stable states emerge, depending on how grazers impact their resources. These results depend on food web architecture, however. For instance, predators can alter or reduce possibilities for stoichiometry‐mediated coexistence of grazers.",https://doi.org/10.1086/422201,0
385,"Effects of spatial aggregation on competition, complementarity and resource use","Abstract The spatial distributions of most species are aggregated to varying degrees. A limited number of studies have examined the effects of spatial aggregation on interspecific and intraspecific interactions, generally finding that spatial aggregation can enhance coexistence between species by reducing the capacity for interspecific competition. Less well studied are the effects of spatial aggregation on complementarity (i.e. differences in resource use strategies) and resource use. Our primary hypothesis was that spatial aggregation reduces the complementarity between species owing to: (i) less interspecific interactions as a result of spatial separation; and (ii) less differences between species as a result of phenotypic plasticity. We further postulate that these negative effects of spatial aggregation on complementarity will reduce resource use by the community. Here we test these hypotheses in a pot experiment in which we applied three levels of spatial aggregation to three sets of two‐species mixtures of herbaceous perennial plant species from native grasslands of south‐eastern Australia. Both root and shoot biomass were significantly affected by spatial aggregation, although the nature of these affects depended upon the species involved, and the relative strengths of interspecific versus intraspecific competition. Complementarity between species in the distribution of their green leaves decreased significantly as spatial aggregation increased for one of the species mixtures, providing some evidence in support of our hypothesis that aggregation reduces complementarity through phenotypic plasticity. Spatial aggregation also altered light interception and use of soil moisture resources, although these effects were dependent on the species involved. We suggest that clear effects of spatial aggregation on complementarity and resource use may be obscured by the idiosyncratic way in which neighbour identity influences plant growth and hence plant size, limiting the ability to generalize, at the community level, any underlying effects of spatial pattern on ecological process.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2007.01813.x,0

In the highly variable deep-sea hydrothermal vent environment, physical and chemical factors are known to play an important role in limiting the distribution and abundance of species, but the importance of biotic interactions remains largely unresolved. The high density and biomass attained by the vent macrofauna suggest that resource partitioning and competition may be significant in these communities. This study of food resource utilisation at northeast Pacific deep-sea hydrothermal vents uses an approach based on stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses to characterise trophic interactions between the 3 dominant alvinellid polychaetes, Paralvinella palmiformis, P. sulfincola, and P. pandorae. We also examine size structure in sympatric and allopatric populations of P. palmiformis and P. pandorae. Results indicate that food resource partitioning occurs both intra- and interspecifically in P. palmiformis and P. sulfincola, and we advocate that this process contributes to explaining their co-existence at very high densities. In contrast, P. pandorae has a much more restricted trophic niche, overlaps P. palmiformis in diet and is much smaller in size when found in sympatry with P. palmiformis. P. pandorae is the most likely of the 3 species to be affected by intra- and/or interspecific competition for food, and this may explain the drastic change in the population size structure observed between successive years. Our work indicates that within the limits imposed by environmental conditions, biotic interactions such as food resource partitioning and competition can be significant factors structuring deep-sea hydrothermal vent communities.

387,Modelling how resource competition among snail hosts affects the mollusciciding frequency and intensity needed to control human schistosomes,"Abstract Ecological interactions among intermediate hosts or vectors of human pathogens can enhance or hinder control efforts. However, we currently lack quantitative frameworks to predict how interactions among host physiology, ecology and control effort shape human disease risk. We explore this approach for human schistosomiasis, a major, historically neglected tropical disease. A recent re‐emphasis on snail host control using molluscicides highlights the need to re‐evaluate the ecological mechanisms driving emergence of schistosome cercariae, the life stage that directly infects humans. We integrate physiology, resource competition and control using individual‐based models based on general metabolic theory, Dynamic Energy Budget theory, to simulate human infectious schistosome density under molluscicide scenarios varying in frequency and intensity throughout a 150‐day transmission season. Without molluscicide control, our model predicts intense resource competition among hosts and large and early parasite peaks under algae and detritus resources. Consistent monthly control, as recommended by the WHO, can work if intense, that is, &gt;90% host mortality. In contrast, one‐off, intense and early mollusciciding induces large delayed rebounds in parasites by releasing the few remaining snails from resource competition. Our simulations confirm the WHO recommendation that frequent mollusciciding can disrupt transmission, but contradict recent suggestions for infrequent mollusciciding, for example, annually, which can backfire because relaxed resource competition among hosts stimulates parasite production. Our results identify resource competition as a key ecological mechanism driving parasite population intensity for schistosome habitats across ecosystems. Our results show resource ecology models can identify peaks in parasite density. More generally, resource competition among hosts may complicate efforts to control infected snail host densities in the field and thus disease risk through culling or mortality‐based interventions. Connecting individuals to community and disease dynamics with resource ecology can inform better field control strategies and help managers avoid unintended consequences for human health.

388,Prototheca-Mediated Interference Competition between Anuran Larvae Operates by Resource Diversion,"Growth of small anuran larvae (Bufo calamita) was inhibited in the presence of larger larvae (Rana temporaria) by an interference mechanism involving unicellular algae of the genus Prototheca. Protothecans sequestered only small amounts of available nutrients during their passage through the larval gut, but their presence in feces diverted small tadpoles from high-quality food sources and thus promoted coprophagy as an alternative feeding strategy. Large larvae produced protothecans in their feces in numbers inversely related to food supply, which accentuated growth inhibition of small larvae at low resource levels. A simple model of growth inhibition was developed to account for these observations.",https://doi.org/10.1086/physzool.65.4.30158541,0
389,Competition and Patterns of Resource Use by Two Sympatric Raptors,"We examined the diets of two sympatric raptors, Swainson's Hawks (Buteo Swainsoni) and Harris' Hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus), during a prey decline that resulted in lowered reproductive success for both species. Contrary to the predictions of competition theory, diets of the two species did not become more specialized. However, we observed interspecific aggression by Swainson's Hawks, which evidently defended a large territory against Harris' Hawks. We conclude that direct competition for food did not take place between these two hawks because such competition was mediated by competition for territories and the subsequent partitioning of space.",https://doi.org/10.2307/1370185,0
390,Periodic temporal environmental variations induce coexistence in resource competition models,"Natural ecosystems, in particular on the microbial scale, are inhabited by a large number of species. The population size of each species is affected by interactions of individuals with each other and by spatial and temporal changes in environmental conditions, such as resource abundance. Here, we use a generic population dynamics model to study how, and under what conditions, a periodic temporal environmental variation can alter an ecosystem's composition and biodiversity. We demonstrate that using time scale separation allows one to qualitatively predict the long-term population dynamics of interacting species in varying environments. We show that the notion of Tilman's R* rule, a well-known principle that applies for constant environments, can be extended to periodically varying environments if the time scale of environmental changes (e.g., seasonal variations) is much faster than the time scale of population growth (doubling time in bacteria). When these time scales are similar, our analysis shows that a varying environment deters the system from reaching a steady state, and stable coexistence between multiple species becomes possible. Our results posit that biodiversity can in part be attributed to natural environmental variations.",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2202.11635,0
391,The role of resource competition in the Wolbachia-Host relationship,"Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever represent a significant burden on global health, with millions of cases occurring annually. Current mosquito control strategies have not been able to prevent the recent resurgence of these diseases, necessitating the development of alternative strategies. One such strategy involves infecting key mosquito species, including the primary dengue vector Aedes aegypti, with the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis. In mosquitoes, Wolbachia cause pathogen blocking and restrict the reproduction of dengue and many other pathogens, leading to a decrease in vector competence. A further Wolbachia-induced phenotype, cytoplasmic incompatibility, allows Wolbachia to spread through uninfected insect populations in a self-sustaining manner. These phenotypes make Wolbachia a promising option for mosquito biocontrol. Wolbachia can affect many other aspects of the insect host’s physiology, including altering lifespan, feeding habits, locomotor behaviour and fecundity, but the basis of these effects is unclear. Interestingly, the Wolbachia genome is suggestive of nutritional parasitism. Many basic metabolic pathways are missing or incomplete and this indicates that Wolbachia must rely on a number of host resources. In this thesis I assess the hypothesis that competition over these key resources contributes to some of the physiological changes seen in Wolbachia-infected insects. Cholesterol is a critical resource involved in many biological processes, which both Wolbachia and infecting viruses require for their replication and survival. Host cholesterol is likely to be scarce, as insects cannot synthesis it themselves. Competition for cholesterol could potentially underlie many Wolbachia-induced phenotypes including pathogen blocking. In Chapter 2, the role of cholesterol in pathogen blocking was examined using the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. Flies were reared on cholesterol-enriched food for multiple generations and then challenged with the pathogenic Drosophila C virus. Overall, there was a weaker pathogen blocking effect for high cholesterol flies and this translated to a decrease in average survival time of 2-5 days and an increase in the viral accumulation rate compared to Wolbachia-infected flies on standard food. In Chapter 4, the role of bloodmeal cholesterol in pathogen blocking was considered in A. aegypti. Mosquitoes were provided with a range of cholesterol-enriched bloodmeals, dosed with dengue virus. After virus quantification it was clear that there was no difference in viral titre of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes regardless of bloodmeal cholesterol level. The one exception was for a rat blood control diet, which had the lowest cholesterol level. Here no Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes became infected with dengue, suggesting that low bloodmeal cholesterol levels may contribute in some way to pathogen blocking strength. In Chapter three, cholesterol and amino acids, both key resources in egg development, were considered in the context of Wolbachia-induced changes to A. aegypti fecundity seen after feeding a non-human bloodmeal. Wolbachia-infected A. aegypti had 15-25% lower levels of cholesterol suggesting that Wolbachia is utilising and depleting the supply of host cholesterol. Through dietary manipulation, we increased the bloodmeal cholesterol provided to Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes, but observed no change to either fecundity or egg viability. Amino acids are another vital resource involved in all manner of physiological processes including protein synthesis and regulation of egg development. After feeding on a non-human bloodmeal Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes fed an amino acid supplemented diet laid approximately 15-20 more eggs than those fed a standard diet. Egg viability for these mosquitoes was also increased by 30-40%, and the majority of eggs appeared to be properly developed. These results suggest that Wolbachia sequesters host amino acids at the expense of developing eggs. In Chapter 5, the metabolic changes caused by two different Wolbachia infections of A. aegypti through 1H NMR profiling were considered. The results revealed extensive manipulation of the amino acid pathways with increased levels of methionine, lysine and tryptophan and decreased levels of histidine. There were also significant effects on the host’s energy network and electron transport chain as evidenced by higher levels of ATP, NAD+/NADH and lower levels of pyruvate seen with infection. Wolbachia infection also causes significant changes to the host neurotransmitter profile, with infected mosquitoes exhibiting decreased levels of key neurotransmitters serotonin and acetylcholine, changes to key compounds in the dopamine biosynthesis pathway and increased levels of GABA. Together these changes represent a heavy metabolic burden due to infection, and this could contribute to some of the major physiological effects of infection. It is clear from these results that competition between host and symbiont for key resources is occurring and that this competition can explain manipulations of host physiology by Wolbachia. Due to the importance of host fitness for Wolbachia-based biocontrol these findings represent a critical advance in the understanding of Wolbachia-host interactions.",,0
392,Habitat and food resource use of perch and roach in a deep mesotrophic reservoir: enough space to avoid competition?,"Abstract – The aim of this study was to test assumptions about the interaction of perch ( Perca fluviatilis L.) and roach ( Rutilus rutilus L.) concerning their food and habitat use in a deep and mesotrophic reservoir. From 1998 to 2001 the fish were caught with gillnets to perform diet analyses. Additionally, vertical gillnets were set to study vertical spatial distribution of both species. The results indicate that in a large and deep reservoir perch and roach are able to avoid competition by separating their niches first in the spatial dimension and then in the dimension of food utilisation. These separations result in low inter‐ and intraspecific competition of both species. We conclude that these niche separations can widen the juvenile competitive bottleneck to such an extent that the perch are not forced to compete with their older conspecifics during their first year of life, enabling perch to become large and consequently piscivorous.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2005.00120.x,0
393,Phloem-Feeding Specialists Sharing a Host Tree: Resource Partitioning Minimizes Interference Competition among Galling Aphid Species,"This study deals with a guild of specialist, phloem feeding aphids (Homoptera; Pemphigidae; Fordinae) which form galls on Pistachia trees (Anacardiaceae). In Israel, each of two Pistacia species carries five common species of galling aphids, which may occur in large numbers on the same individual tree, shoot, leaf or even leaflet. These Fordinae have very similar life cycles, they all feed on phloem sap, and all of them need very young, unfolding leaves for gall formation. Our data show, however, that most pairs of species are unlikely to compete for galling sites because their niches are separated either temporally (fundatrices arrive at different times and, therefore, occupy different leaves) or spatially, by attacking different sites on the tree, shoot, or leaf. In 1991-1993, we calculated niche breadth (B) of each species, and proportional similarity (PS) between each species pair on shoots colonized by more than one species. PS between different species pairs on leaves within shoots ranged between 0 and 0.48. This means that, on the niche dimension represented by the shoot, the two species may share some of the habitat units. If the two species compete, we expected that niche breadth of at least one of them would be reduced on the cohabited shoots. This was not the case. B was not negatively affected when pairs of species occupied the same shoot, compared with shoots where only one species was present. B was positively correlated with density: the chance of niche overlap increased when more galls occupied the same shoot. In species sharing leaves within shoots, B showed similar trends. On P. atlantica, Smynthurodes betae and Forda riccobonii had the highest PS. Both the species make their galls on leaflet margins and occur frequently on the same leaves. Only at this level did we detect negative interactions: the frequency of co-occurrence of galls of both species on the same leaflet (within galled leaves) was significantly less than expected by chance. Taking into account our deliberate non-random selection of trees, shoots, and leaves, where competition was likely to occur, we conclude that interspecific interference competition for galling sites is not a major determinant of the resource partitioning of these closely-related herbivores",https://doi.org/10.2307/3545732,0
394,Resource quality or competition: why increase resource acceptance in the presence of conspecifics?,"Some animal species increase resource acceptance rates in the presence of conspecifics. Such responses may be adaptive if the presence of conspecifics is a reliable indicator of resource quality. Similarly, these responses could represent an adaptive reduction in choosiness under high levels of scramble competition. Although high resource quality and high levels of scramble competition should both favor increased resource acceptance, the contexts in which the increase occurs should differ. In this paper, we tested the effect of social environment on egg-laying and aggressive behavior in the walnut fly, Rhagoletis juglandis, in multiple contexts to determine whether increased resource acceptance in the presence of conspecifics was better viewed as a response to increased host quality or increased competition. We found that grouped females oviposit more readily than isolated females when provided small (low-quality) artificial hosts but not when provided large (high-quality) artificial hosts, indicating that conspecific presence reduces choosiness. Increased resource acceptance was observed even when exposure to conspecifics was temporally or spatially separate from exposure to the resource. Finally, we found that individuals showed reduced aggression after being housed in groups, as expected under high levels of scramble competition. These results indicate that the pattern of resource acceptance in the presence of conspecifics may be better viewed as a response to increased scramble competition rather than as a response to public information about resource quality.",https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arr042,0
395,Investigating resource competition in cereal-legume intercropping systems,"Intercropping has long been a key crop production strategy for low input farming systems, such as those of smallholders, and organic farmers, where two or more crops are used to allow for the complementary use of resources, such as light, water, and nutrients. Although some intercropping systems have shown success, our understanding of them is not fully complete. The increasing need to utilise ecosystem resources as efficiently as possible demands a more comprehensive understanding, in particular as large-scale, high production farming systems begin to show interest in mixed specie crop production. A more site-specific approach is required, which looks at management aspects, such as planting practices, fertiliser and irrigation use, soil type, weather conditions, and cultivar choice. This thesis looks at cereal-legume row intercropping with very different management and environmental conditions in India and Germany. A major challenge with intercropping research is to efficiently investigate all potential scenarios using traditional experimentation. Process-based agro-ecosystem modelling is explored and used to conduct virtual experiments using the crop simulation model (CSM) APSIM. The general discussion develops overall conclusions for intercropping strategies and the scope of their future use. Chapters two and three are based on the use of intercropping as part of a climate resilient, risk reducing cropping strategy in semi-arid regions. As there is little knowledge of how and to what extent intercropping can be a viable option under future conditions, a field experiment in the dry season offered an opportunity to test this system under extreme but real-world conditions. Consequently, a field trial was run in semi-arid India over a two-year period (2015 and 2016) in the dry and hot (summer) season. These trials were set up as a split-split-plot experiment with four replicates to assess the performance of simultaneously sown sole versus intercropped stands of pearl millet and cowpea, with two densities (30 cm and 60 cm spacing between rows - both with 10 cm spacing within rows), and three drip irrigation treatments (severe stress, partial stress, and well-watered). Results showed that intercropping pearl millet led to a significantly lower total grain yield in comparison to the sole equivalent. Pearl millet’s highest yields were 1,350 kg/ha when intercropped and 2,970 kg/ha when grown as a sole crop; for cowpea, 990 kg/ha when intercropped, and 1,150 kg/ha as a sole crop. Interestingly, even when maximum daily temperatures reached up to 42.2 °C (julian day 112 in 2016), well-watered, pearl millet produced reasonable yields. We conclude that sole as opposed to intercropping systems could be a more efficient and therefore suitable practice under similar temperature regimes. However, more research would be needed to identify a suitable cowpea genotype and planting density that could allow for higher intercropped pearl millet yields. Clearly, despite the bulk of the literature promoting the benefits of intercropping, the system per se is not a ‘silver bullet’ solution to agricultural production and sustainability needs. We believe it is important to link such detailed experimental data with models to help reveal the mechanistic processes beneath system performance. This third chapter illustrates this approach using the data presented in chapter two, which was tested against APSIM simulations. After rigorous model calibration and validation, simulation experiments evaluated the manipulation of genetic traits, such as maximum plant height, i.e. ‘ideotyping’. The model showed distinct interactions and our approach the ability to highlight insights into intercropping systems. For the pearl millet-cowpea intercrop simulations, the cereal was the driver of total intercrop yield. To achieve this, the cereal intercrop component had to be taller than the cowpea. Chapter four of this thesis looked at a mechanised system using intercrop combinations of eight winter faba bean genotypes and three winter wheat varieties on two sites in temperate central Germany. Intercropping was higher yielding than sole crop equivalents, especially on the more marginal site and soil. Limited leaf area index and canopy height of faba bean are key traits for high yielding winter bean-wheat intercrops. Based on the genetic material used in this experiment, marginal sites are better cultivated with vigorous genotypes, while fertile sites require less vigorous ones. Mirrored in the simluation experiment of chapter three, this strategy works to ensure good cereal yields as excessive legume biomass growth must not out compete the cereal for light. Winter faba beans in particular should be bred to restrain from excess vegetative biomass development under more fertile conditions. While intercropping can play a role in robust food production systems, further experimentation is needed to help design specific GxExM combinations of intercrop systems. This thesis finishes with a detailed discussion that looks not only into findings and discussion points of the core chapters, but also some of the challenges and ways forward for intercropping research and CSM.",https://doi.org/10.53846/goediss-8230,0
396,Identifying resource competition in maize-based soil conservation systems using<sup>13</sup>C and<sup>15</sup>N isotopic discrimination,"Soil conservation measures such as establishing grass barriers or cover crops effectively control erosion but also provoke competition, which reduces yields of companion crops. We used 13C and 15N natural abundance profiles to identify the causes of competition of soil conservation measures on a field with 59% slope in Northwest Vietnam three years after establishment. Treatments were maize under farmer’s practice (T1, control), maize with Guinea grass barriers (T2), maize under minimum tillage (MT) with Pinto peanuts as cover crop (T3), and maize under MT and relay cropped with Adzuki beans (T4). A pretest using data from zero-N plots revealed that abundance of water and limited nitrogen availability induced low grain N concentrations, enriched leaf δ13C, and reduced maize grain yield. Similar low N leaf concentrations and elevated δ13C values were observed in maize growing close to frequently pruned grass barriers under positive water balance conditions, indicating that yield decline in these rows can be attributed mainly to N competition. Enriched δ15N values of maize from rows next to barriers indicated reliance on soil N rather than on 15N-depleted fertiliser N. Vigorous cover crop growth under MT resulted in maize yield decline due to N competition while relay-cropped legumes did not trigger inter-species competition having a similar maize yield, leaf N concentration, δ13C, and δ15N as the control.",https://doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2015.1074185,0
397,COUNTERINTUITIVE OUTCOMES OF INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION BETWEEN TWO GRASSHOPPER SPECIES ALONG A RESOURCE GRADIENT,"Interspecific competition has long been implicated as a force structuring the distribution of organisms along environmental gradients. The research presented here uses a survey, foraging observations, and a manipulative field experiment that test the included-niche competition hypothesis as a mechanism structuring the distribution of a generalist grasshopper, Melanoplus femurrubrum, along a food-resource gradient. A field survey of 10 old fields revealed a step-like reduction in M. femurrubrum abundance as the proportion of grass cover in the fields exceeded 60%. Furthermore, M. femurrubrum abundance and the abundance of a potential competitor, the grass specialist Chorthippus curtipennis, were negatively correlated among the fields. Experimental foraging observations showed that M. femurrubrum was a polyphagous feeder that preferred grass and consumed less grass in the presence of C. curtipennis. The pattern of grasshopper distribution and foraging data support an included-niche competition hypothesis. However, in a field experiment that manipulated C. curtipennis presence and absence and the composition of vegetation in which competition might occur, growth and mortality rates in M. femurrubrum did not respond to C. curtipennis competition. Performance was predicted to be lowest in grass-dominated conditions, those corresponding to the locations where M. femurrubrum does not exist. Instead, growth rates were highest and mortality rates were lowest in grass-only treatments. While the survey and foraging observations support the included-niche hypothesis, the experiments suggest that interspecific competition in adult grasshoppers is not the cause of the grasshopper distribution pattern. Similar experiments in western North American prairies indicate that interspecific competition can be important and that foraging ecology can be a good indicator of the interaction. This study contributes to the increasing body of knowledge about interspecific competition's role in organism distributions. It demonstrates that geographic similarity in natural history need not lead to a similar importance of limiting factors.",https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[0948:cooicb]2.0.co;2,0
398,Emergent Shapes of Trait-Based Competition Functions from Resource-Based Models: A Gaussian Is Not Normal in Plant Communities,"In community ecology, it is widely assumed that organisms with similar traits compete more intensely with one another for resources. This assumption is often encoded into theory and empirical tests via a unimodal competition function, which predicts that per capita competitive effect declines with separation in traits. Yet it remains unknown how well this function represents the true effect of traits on competitive outcomes, especially for long-lived plant communities, where lifetime fitness is difficult to estimate. Here, we evaluate the shape of competition functions embedded in two resource-based (RB) models, wherein plants compete for shared, essential resources. In the first RB model individuals compete for two essential nutrients, and in the second they compete for light in a size-based successional setting. We compared the shapes of the competition functions that emerged from interactions within these RB models to the unimodal function and others shapes commonly applied. In few instances did the trait-based competition function emerging from the RB model even vaguely resemble any of the shapes previously used. The mismatch between these two approaches suggests that theory derived using fixed competition functions based on trait separation may not apply well to plant systems, where individuals compete for shared resources. The more promising path will be to model depletion of resources by populations in relation to their traits, with its consequences for fitness landscapes and competitive exclusion.",https://doi.org/10.1086/714868,0

Habitat and diet utilization were compared between juvenile striped bass and bluefish in 3 New York Bight marine embayments. Juvenile bluefish and striped bass were seldom captured together during the summer and early fall, suggesting low habitat overlap at the scale of a beach seine haul. Diet overlap was also low; age-0 bluefish (spring- and summer-spawned cohorts) had a more piscivorous diet than age-0 and age-1 striped bass. A 60d laboratory growth experiment tested for interference competition between age-0 bluefish (spring-spawned) and age-1 striped bass fed fish prey in mixed- and single-species treatments. In the growth experiment, bluefish grew significantly faster than striped bass; however, within a species, there was no significant difference in growth between the mixed- and single-species treatments. Additionally, long-term field-monitoring data showed that annual estimates of growth rate for bluefish and striped bass were not correlated with annual estimates of their potential competitor¹s density. These field and laboratory data provide no evidence for competitive interactions between juvenile striped bass and bluefish.

400,Specifying the Harsh Conditions of Life: Resource Competition and Predation in the 1970s,"Despite its publication in The American Naturalist, the historical impact of Levin et al. (1977) has been largely lost in the general ecological literature. Its significance has been better appreciated in the microbial ecology literature, where it is often cited as an authority on ecological concepts, from fitness trade-offs to community dynamics. Most notably, Levin and colleagues provided a framework for thinking concretely about microbial competition and predation, at a time when the field of microbial ecology largely dealt with describing microbial diversity but not the dynamics that generate and maintain that diversity. That article provides a key link between even earlier work on the coevolution of bacteria and viruses (M. J. B. Paynter and H. R. Bungay III, 1969, “Dynamics of Coliphage Infections,” pages 323–335 in D. Perlman, ed., Fermentation Advances, Academic Press, New York) and the recent and ongoing growth of microbial population biology and experimental evolution. It also highlights the development of theory that combined trophic cascades and competition—topics that are increasingly relevant as microbial ecologists strive to make sense of metagenomic data and spatiotemporal patterns of microbial diversity. As microbial and general ecology continue to be reintegrated (B. J. M. Bohannan and R. E. Lenski, 2000, “Linking Genetic Change to Community Evolution: Insights from Studies of Bacteria and Bacteriophage,” Ecology Letters 3:362–377; C. M. Jessup, R. Kassen, S. E. Forde, B. Kerr, A.

401,Molecular signatures of resource competition: clonal interference favors ecological diversification and can lead to incipient speciation,"Abstract Microbial ecosystems harbor an astonishing diversity that can persist for long times. To understand how such diversity is structured and maintained, ecological and evolutionary processes need to be integrated at similar timescales. Here, we study a model of resource competition that allows for evolution via de novo mutation, and focus on rapidly adapting asexual populations with large mutational inputs, as typical of many bacteria species. We characterize the adaptation and diversification of an initially maladapted population and show how the eco-evolutionary dynamics are shaped by the interaction between simultaneously emerging lineages – clonal interference. We find that in large populations, more intense clonal interference fosters diversification under sympatry, increasing the probability that phenotypically and genetically distinct clusters stably coexist. In smaller populations, the accumulation of deleterious and compensatory mutations can push further the diversification process and kick-start speciation. Our findings have implications beyond microbial populations, providing novel insights about the interplay between ecology and evolution in clonal populations.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.20.391151,0
402,Timing of resource input and larval competition between invasive and native container-inhabiting mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae),"Container-inhabiting mosquito species are subject to both intraspecific and interspecific competition during larval development in resource-limited habitats. The arrival of an invasive species, Aedes albopictus, in the U.S. has altered competitive interactions among container-inhabiting mosquito species and, in some cases, has led to displacement of these species. Resource enrichment of container habitats has been shown to alleviate competitive interactions and to promote species co-existence; however, the importance of the timing of enrichment has yet to be explored. Larval competition between Ae. albopictus and a native species, Ochlerotatus triseriatus, was explored when resources were added either gradually or in a single pulse. Replacement series experiments revealed that Ae. albopictus was able to outcompete and displace Oc. triseriatus via resource monopolization when all resources were made available simultaneously; however, when the same resource amount was added over time, survival was high for both species, leading to co-existence. Timing of resource input also had an effect in monospecific treatments, indicating that intraspecific competition impacts survival as well. Duration of larval development was influenced by both species presence and by timing of resource input for Oc. triseriatus. These results indicate competitive outcome is condition-specific and that timing of resource input can determine whether a dominant invasive competitor displaces a native species, or if the two species are able to co-exist. Both intraspecific and interspecific competition occur at different temporal scales due to species-specific differences in larval developmental time. Timing of resource availability in container habitats can impact mosquito survival via competitive interactions, which can ultimately influence vector population size and behavior, possibly influencing vector-borne disease transmission.",https://doi.org/10.3376/1081-1710(2007)32[252:torial]2.0.co;2,0
403,Environmental resource interactions affect red raspberry growth and its competition with white spruce,"Multifactor experiments were used to study the effects of (1) shade, moisture, and nutrients on above- and below-ground biomass production of red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) and (2) intra- versus inter-specific competition for light, nitrogen, and space in interplantings of raspberry and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) seedlings. Interactive effects among the manipulated resources on seedling growth were common. Raspberry biomass increased with increasing moisture and nutrients or with added nitrogen when nitrogen was the only nutrient manipulated. Seventy-three percent shade reduced raspberry biomass production, while production under full sun and 30% shade was similar. Raspberry shoot/root ratio increased with increasing nutrients and shade but decreased with age. In mixed plantings with spruce, when nitrogen was added, raspberry biomass and shoot/root ratio increased at the expense of spruce, while the shoot/root ratio decreased with shade in low-nitrogen plots. Spruce height growth was not affected by light level, nitrogen addition, or competition type; however, spruce diameter and biomass production decreased with competition from both raspberry and spruce and increased with increasing growing space and in low-nitrogen shaded plots where raspberry was less common.",https://doi.org/10.1139/x99-078,0
404,"Simple models combining competition, defence and resource availability have broad implications in pelagic microbial food webs","Abstract In food webs, interactions between competition and defence control the partitioning of limiting resources. As a result, simple models of these interactions contain links between biogeochemistry, diversity, food web structure and ecosystem function. Working at hierarchical levels, these mechanisms also produce self‐similarity and therefore suggest how complexity can be generated from repeated application of simple underlying principles. Reviewing theoretical and experimental literature relevant to the marine photic zone, we argue that there is a wide spectrum of phenomena, including single cell activity of prokaryotes, microbial biodiversity at different levels of resolution, ecosystem functioning, regional biogeochemical features and evolution at different timescales; that all can be understood as variations over a common principle, summarised in what has been termed the ‘Killing‐the‐Winner’ (KtW) motif. Considering food webs as assemblages of such motifs may thus allow for a more integrated approach to aquatic microbial ecology.",https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13122,0
405,"Competition, resource partitioning and coexistence of an endoparasitoid <i>Encarsia perniciosi</i> and an ectoparasitoid <i>Aphytis melinus</i> of the California red scale","Abstract. 1. Laboratory experiments and field studies were conducted to explain the coexistence of an endoparasitoid, Encarsia perniciosi Tower, and an ectoparasitoid, Aphytis melinus DeBach, both of which were introduced into California to control the California red scale, Aonidiella aurantii (Mask.). 2. Encarsia parasitized all scale stages but it preferred first and second instar scales. This is in contrast to Aphytis melinus , in which previous studies have shown that it parasitizes second and third instar females and second instar males but prefers third instar female scales. Encarsia developed most rapidly when it parasitized an early second instar and slowest when it parasitized the mature female scale. However, on early second instar scales it was about 80% as fecund as a wasp that emerged from a mature female scale. 3. Second instar scales parasitized by Encarsia were accepted by Aphytis as readily as unparasitized scales. 4. Encarsia did not distinguish between unparasitized hosts and those previously parasitized by Aphytis. 5. Encarsia always outcompeted by Aphytis when both species parasitize the same host. 6. Encarsia prefers scale on stems whereas Aphytis prefers those on leaves and fruits. This, too, may be a result of interspecific competition with Aphytis. 7. The partitioning of the scale resource by the two species explains why they coexist in coastal southern California but it does not explain why Encarsia disappeared from citrus groves in the inland valleys coincident with the introduction of Aphytis melinus into southern California.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.1990.tb00830.x,0
406,Habitat deterioration relaxes resource competition and sexual selection in the threespine stickleback,"The operation of sexual selection depends on ecological conditions. Thus, changes in environmental conditions because of human activities can alter the strength and direction of sexual selection, with implications for evolutionary trajectories and the viability of populations. We show that aquatic algal blooms can relax the operation of sexual selection by influencing which males are available to attract females. This is by influencing the ability of males to maintain a resource needed in mate attraction. When we exposed two competing threespine stickleback males Gasterosteus aculeatus , whose attractiveness to females was known, to either clear or algal‐turbid water, nest abandonment was more common in clear water, and it was usually the unattractive male that abandoned his nest. In turbid water, on the other hand, nest abandonments were less common and when they occurred, the probability increased that the attractive male abandoned his nest, and that the unattractive male subsequently occupied it. This change in the composition of nesting males increased the mating success of unattractive males. Thus, our results reveal a new mechanism through which habitat deterioration can influence sexual selection, by altering success in the competition for a resource critical in mate attraction, a territory with a nest in this case. This could be a common mechanism, considering the prevalence of resource competition in mate choice systems. On a broader level, our results emphasise the importance of considering the impact of environmental changes on the outcome of resource competition when investigating the influence that environmental disturbances have on the operation of sexual selection and thereby on evolutionary processes and population dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.07750,0
407,Resource characteristics and competition affect colony and individual foraging strategies of the wood ant <i>Formica integroides</i>,"Abstract 1. Resource characteristics and competitive pressure can affect an ant colony’s foraging strategy. This study examined the ability of the wood ant Formica integroides to respond, at both the colony and individual levels, to changes in competitive pressure for access to terrestrial and arboreal resources. 2. Because foraging behaviours depend on resource characteristics, foraging for different resource types (e.g. terrestrial and arboreal habitats) produces different spatial or territorial arrangements. In this study, terrestrial contests for resources followed an interference‐exploitation tradeoff, while arboreal foragers defended entire trees as absolute territories. 3. Competitive pressure for access to arboreal resources was shown to increase with distance from F. integroides nests. 4. In this study, the ability of F. integroides to defend a resource varied with body size. Large foragers were better defenders than small foragers. For groups of foragers, the ability to defend a resource increased with the ratio of large to small foragers. 5. In response to competitive pressure, F. integroides colonies altered the size distribution of arboreal, but not terrestrial, foragers. An increase in competitive pressure was matched by an increase in the number of large foragers allocated to trees. This response to competition affected the relationship between body size and distance from the nest for arboreal foragers. 6. Foraging behaviours for individual arboreal foragers also varied with competitive pressure. As competition increased, large arboreal foragers spent more time in direct contact with the resource rather than standing between resource patches.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2007.00950.x,0
408,COMPETITION BETWEEN NICROPHORUS ORBICOLLIS AND N. DEFODIENS: RESOURCE LOCATING EFFICIENCY AND TEMPORAL PARTITIONING,"The larger-bodied burying beetle, Nicrophorus orbicollis, competes with the smaller N. defodiens for valued, protein-rich, carrion resources. We tested four hypotheses of this competitive relationship. We found support for the hypotheses that N. defodiens locates fresh carcasses more quickly than N. orbicollis and that carcasses placed under the leaf litter are more difficult for Nicrophorus to locate than carcasses placed above the leaf litter. By shifting the photocycle of N. defodienswe were able to manipulate this normally crepuscular species into beginning its active period 3 h later, during the active period of the nocturnal N. orbicollis. This clock-shift eliminates the 3 h head start that N. defodiens typically experiences in the field. We did not find support for the hypothesis that clock-shifted N. defodiens would suffer in competition compared to non-clock-shifted beetles. We did find support for the hypothesis that the presence of N. defodiens on a carcass provides clues to searching N. orbicollis. We suggest that the presence of efficient carrion searchers such as N. defodiens may significantly increase the numbers and success of the Nicrophorus guild.",https://doi.org/10.1656/1092-6194(2002)009[0013:cbnoan]2.0.co;2,0
409,"Niche filtering, not interspecific resource competition, explains the geographical co-occurrence of butterfly species","The relevance of interspecific resource competition in the context of community assembly by herbivorous insects is a well-known topic in ecology. Most previous studies focused on local species assemblies, that shared host plants. Few studies evaluated species pairs within a single taxon when investigating the effects of host plant sharing at the regional scale. Herein, we explore the effect of plant sharing on the geographical co-occurrence patterns of 229 butterflies distributed across the Japanese archipelago; we use two spatial scales (10 × 10 km and 1 × 1 km grids) to this end. We considered that we might encounter one of two predictable patterns in terms of the relationship between co-occurrence and host-sharing among butterflies. On the one hand, host-sharing might promote distributional exclusivity attributable to interspecific resource competition. On the other hand, sharing of host plants might promote co-occurrence attributable to filtering by resource niche. At both grid scales, we found significant negative correlations between host use similarity and distributional exclusivity. Our results support the thesis that the butterfly co-occurrence pattern across the Japanese archipelago is better explained by filtering via resource niche rather than interspecific resource competition.",,0
410,"CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT AS THE ""BEST OF A BAD SITUATION"": FITNESS TRADE-OFFS RESULTING FROM SELECTION TO MINIMIZE RESOURCE AND MATE COMPETITION","Abstract Character displacement has long been considered a major cause of adaptive diversification. When species compete for resources or mates, character displacement minimizes competition by promoting divergence in phenotypes associated with resource use (ecological character displacement) or mate attraction (reproductive character displacement). In this study, we investigated whether character displacement can also have pleiotropic effects that lead to fitness trade-offs between the benefits of avoiding competition and costs accrued in other fitness components. We show that both reproductive and ecological character displacement have caused spadefoot toads to evolve smaller body size in the presence of a heterospecific competitor. Although this shift in size likely arose as a by-product of character displacement acting to promote divergence between species in mating behavior and larval development, it concomitantly reduces offspring survival, female fecundity, and sexual selection on males. Thus, character displacement may represent the ""best of a bad situation"" in that it lessens competition, but at a cost. Individuals in sympatry with the displaced phenotype will have higher fitness than those without the displaced trait because they experience reduced competition, but they may have reduced fitness relative to individuals in allopatry. Such a fitness trade-off can limit the conditions under which character displacement evolves and may even increase the risk of ""Darwinian extinction"" in sympatric populations. Consequently, character displacement may not always promote diversification in the manner that is often expected.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2005.tb00928.x,0
411,Effect of resource availability on evolution of virulence and competition in an environmentally transmitted pathogen,"Understanding ecological and epidemiological factors driving pathogen evolution in contemporary time scales is a major challenge in modern health management. Pathogens that replicate outside the hosts are subject to selection imposed by ambient environmental conditions. Increased nutrient levels could increase pathogen virulence by pre-adapting for efficient use of resources upon contact to a nutrient rich host or by favouring transmission of fast-growing virulent strains. We measured changes in virulence and competition in Flavobacterium columnare, a bacterial pathogen of freshwater fish, under high and low nutrient levels. To test competition between strains in genotype mixtures, we developed a quantitative real-time PCR assay. We found that a virulent strain maintained its virulence and outcompeted less virulent strains independent of the nutrient level and resource renewal rate while a less virulent strain further lost virulence in chemostats under low nutrient level and over long-term serial culture under high nutrient level. Our results suggest that increased outside-host nutrient levels might maintain virulence in less virulent strains and increase their contribution to epidemics in aquaculture. The results highlight a need to further explore the role of resource in the outside-host environment in maintaining strain diversity and driving evolution of virulence among environmentally growing pathogens.",https://doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiy060,0
412,Resource competition shapes biological rhythms and promotes temporal niche differentiation in a community simulation,"Abstract Competition for resources often contributes strongly to defining an organism’s ecological niche. Biological rhythms are important adaptations to the temporal dimension of niches, but the role of other organisms in determining such temporal niches have not been much studied, and the role specifically of competition even less so. We investigate how interspecific and intraspecific competition for resources shapes an organism’s activity rhythms. For this, communities of one or two species in an environment with limited resource input were simulated. We demonstrate that when organisms are arrhythmic, one species will always be competitively excluded from the environment, but the existence of activity rhythms allows niche differentiation and indefinite coexistence of the two species. Two species which are initially active at the same phase will differentiate their phase angle of entrainment over time to avoid each other. When only one species is present in an environment, competition within individuals of the species strongly selects for niche expansion through arrhythmicity, but the addition of an interspecific competitor facilitates evolution of increased rhythmic amplitude when combined with additional adaptations for temporal specialization. Finally, if individuals preferentially mate with others who are active at similar times of day, then disruptive selection by intraspecific competition can split one population into two reproductively isolated groups. In summary, these simulations suggest that biological rhythms are an effective method to temporally differentiate ecological niches, and that competition is an important ecological pressure promoting the evolution of rhythms and sleep. Author summary Why do we sleep? We are interested in the ecological factors which promote the evolution of biological rhythms like the sleep-wake cycle, focusing especially on competition. When animals compete with each other for resources, they often evolve to avoid each other by specializing to use different resources or separating their activity in other ways. To test hypotheses about how competition shapes rest-activity rhythms, we performed computer simulations of a community of animals who move, reproduce, and compete for resources. We show that biological rhythms let two species divide time so that one species is active while its competitor is resting, thus avoiding depleting shared resources. When a species has no competitors in the simulation, competition between members of the same species cause population and individual rhythms to decrease, since resource availability is low when everybody is active at the same time. However, having competitors allows strong rhythms to evolve from originally arrhythmic organisms. Competition can even cause a single population to split into two species which are separated in time.

413,Allelopathic potential and resource competition capability of Amaranthus retroflexus under different nitrogen supply,"In order to approach the relationships between the allelopathy and the resource competition capability of Amaranthus retroflexus during its invasion to farmland ecosystem,a sand culture experiment with A.retroflexus and Glycine max was conducted to study the biomass accumulation and allocation and the nitrogen content in different organs of the two plants under four levels of nitrogen supply with or without the addition of activated carbon.Under lower nitrogen supply,the allelopathic potential of A.retroflexus increased,and its biomass was mainly allocated to reproduction organs,under higher nitrogen supply,the allelopathic potential of A.retroflexus decreased,and its biomass was mainly allocated to root and leaf.Under the conditions of poorer nitrogen nutrition,the nitrogen content of G.max was significantly lower when active carbon was added,compared with the control,but the difference became smaller when the nitrogen supply was increasing.These results suggested that the A.retroflexus during its invasion could adjust its allelopathic potential and biomass allocation to adapt different levels of nitrogen nutrition.",,0
414,The influence of reproductive mode on resource competition and diversity patterns in Ediacaran early animal communities,"The appearance of the oldest known animals during the late Ediacaran (~574 million years ago [Ma]) was followed by a phase of little change. This period, which lasted ~14 million years, ended with a burst of rapid diversification known as the Ediacaran Second Wave. The reasons for these diversity patterns are poorly understood. Here we investigate how reproductive mode mediated community dynamics, and in turn macroevolutionary change, in the Ediacaran. We show that widespread reproduction via stolon (namely via filaments connecting clones) in the first animals limited intra-specific competition among neighbours, leading to inter-specific competition acting at smaller-spatial scales than intra-specific competition, a phenomenon called heteromyopia6. Heteromyopia enables co-existence of sub-optimal competitors because the dispersal limitation of the dominant species means that they do not inhabit all the optimal habitat, so that lesser competitors can still exist within the same community, operating under reduced selection pressure. We explored the consequences of this dispersal limitation on community diversity using Approximate Bayesian Computation to estimate the posterior distributions of dispersal with a spatially explicit model fitted to the three Ediacaran assemblages and showed that the change from stoloniferous to sexual reproduction that coincided with the Second Wave could explain the sudden increase in alpha diversity observed in the fossil record. We conclude that widespread asexual reproduction via stolon likely constrained early animal evolution, limiting diversification until the onset of mobility and widespread sexual reproduction.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.08.632049,0
415,The roles of resource availability and competition in mediating growth rates of invasive and native freshwater snails,"Summary The classic paradigm in community ecology is that competition structures communities, limiting the number of species that can coexist. Under this paradigm, highly diverse communities should be biotically resistant to invasion. However, the importance of biotic resistance in repelling invasions might depend on resources because high resource availability can increase growth rates of invasive species and either reduce or increase competitive effects of invasive species on native community members. We tested how experimentally altered resource levels affected growth rates of an invasive ( P otamopyrgus antipodarum ) and a native snail ( P yrgulopsis robusta ) and interspecific competition between them. P otamopyrgus and P yrgulopis are the dominant macroinvertebrates in streams within the range of the locally endemic P yrgulopsis in W yoming, U . S . A . In the absence of competition, we found that P otamopyrgus always grew faster than P yrgulopsis at both high and low resource levels. In the presence of interspecific competition, P otamopyrgus growth rates were not affected by resource levels or the biomass of P yrgulopsis competitors. On the other hand, P yrgulopsis grew slower at low resource levels and especially when the biomass of P otamopyrgus competitors was high. These results indicate that negative effects of P otamopyrgus on P yrgulopsis growth rates were stronger at low resource levels. In contrast, P yrgulopsis did not reduce P otamopyrgus growth under any resource scenario. Thus, increased resource availability seems to mitigate strong competitive effects of P otamopyrgus on the native snail in this stream.",https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12566,0
416,Interspecific interference competition at the resource patch scale: do large herbivores spatially avoid elephants while accessing water?,"Animals may anticipate and try to avoid, at some costs, physical encounters with other competitors. This may ultimately impact their foraging distribution and intake rates. Such cryptic interference competition is difficult to measure in the field, and extremely little is known at the interspecific level. We tested the hypothesis that smaller species avoid larger ones because of potential costs of interference competition and hence expected them to segregate from larger competitors at the scale of a resource patch. We assessed fine-scale spatial segregation patterns between three African herbivore species (zebra Equus quagga, kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros and giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis) and a megaherbivore, the African elephant Loxodonta africana, at the scale of water resource patches in the semi-arid ecosystem of Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. Nine waterholes were monitored every two weeks during the dry season of a drought year, and observational scans of the spatial distribution of all herbivores were performed every 15 min. We developed a methodological approach to analyse such fine-scale spatial data. Elephants increasingly used waterholes as the dry season progressed, as did the probability of co-occurrence and agonistic interaction with elephants for the three study species. All three species segregated from elephants at the beginning of the dry season, suggesting a spatial avoidance of elephants and the existence of costs of being close to them. However, contrarily to our expectations, herbivores did not segregate from elephants the rest of the dry season but tended to increasingly aggregate with elephants as the dry season progressed. We discuss these surprising results and the existence of a trade-off between avoidance of interspecific interference competition and other potential factors such as access to quality water, which may have relative associated costs that change with the time of the year.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12582,0
417,Using three pairs of competitive indices to test for changes in plant competition under different resource and disturbance levels,"Questions: How do different resource and disturbance levels interact to affect competition? How do different indices of competition change the interpretation of how competition changes under different resource and disturbance conditions? Location: Greenhouse, Thompson Rivers University, Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada. Methods: Three pairs of indices that have been used to differentiate the predictions of Grime (CSR) and Tilman's (R*) theories were used to assess competition on two species of temperate bunchgrass, (Pseudorogeneria spicata and Festuca campestris) grown in a greenhouse on stress and disturbance gradients. Stress was created by manipulating the amount of water (high, low) and concentration of nutrient solution (high, low) added to pots, while disturbance was created by clipping (clipped, unclipped) in a fully factorial design. Plants were grown individually or with a single neighbour. The three pairs of indices were: (1) absolute and relative competition; (2) competitive effect and response; and, (3) competitive importance and intensity. Results: Absolute competition and competitive importance were the only indices responsive to the resource gradient, which supports CSR theory, and also the only ones to record an effect of disturbance on the strength of competition – under high resource conditions. The other indices showed few responses along the gradients, which supports R* theory. Measures of competitive effect and response did not differentiate the two theories. Conclusion: We show that some indices of competition show a decline with increased stress and disturbance, while other indices do not. Therefore, it is necessary to choose a competition index appropriate to the question being asked. Competitive importance and absolute competition were responsive to changes in stress and disturbance, while the other indices were not.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-1103.2010.01207.x,0
418,Resource Colimitation Drives Competition Between Phytoplankton and Bacteria in the Southern Ocean,"Abstract Across the Southern Ocean, phytoplankton growth is governed by iron and light, while bacterial growth is regulated by iron and labile dissolved organic carbon (LDOC). We use a mechanistic model to examine how competition for iron between phytoplankton and bacteria responds to changes in iron, light, and LDOC. Consistent with experimental evidence, increasing iron and light encourages phytoplankton dominance, while increasing LDOC and decreasing light favors bacterial dominance. Under elevated LDOC, bacteria can outcompete phytoplankton for iron, most easily under lower iron. Simulations reveal that bacteria are major iron consumers and suggest that luxury storage plays a key role in competitive iron uptake. Under seasonal conditions typical of the Southern Ocean, sources of LDOC besides phytoplankton exudation modulate the strength of competitive interactions. Continued investigations on the competitive fitness of bacteria in driving changes in primary production in iron‐limited systems will be invaluable in refining these results.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2020gl088369,0
419,Trait-Mediated Effects of Parasitic Phorid Flies (Diptera: Phoridae) on Ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) Competition and Resource Access in Coffee Agro-ecosystems,"Predator effects on prey traits change competitive interactions between prey species affecting resource use. Parasitic phorid flies limit competitive-dominant ant activity, potentially meditating competitive interactions between ant species, changing competitive hierarchies, or affecting ant communities. I considered interactions between phorids (Pseudacteon sp.), their ant host (Azteca instabilis F. Smith), and co-occurring ant species in coffee agro-ecosystems testing whether phorids (1) limit A. instabilis recruitment activity, (2) affect competitive interaction between ant species, and (3) are associated with other species' resource access and therefore have the potential to change competitive hierarchies. I monitored recruitment of A. instabilis and other ants to baits over 90 min on canopy trees with or without phorids. A. instabilis were one-half as abundant with phorids. Other species gained access to baits 12 times more often and were only able to take over baits when phorids were present. Furthermore, many more species (13 versus 2) gained access to resources when phorids were present. These results indicate that phorids mediate competitive interactions between ant species and may influence ant communities by affecting resource availability. Considering that phorids limit A. instabilis attacks on herbivores and that ant species differ in effects on arthropod communities, phorids may have strong community-level effects in coffee agro-ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1603/0046-225x(2005)034[1089:teoppf]2.0.co;2,0
420,Temporal habitat partitioning and resource competition between congenerics: Testing for density-dependent growth and mortality in estuarine shrimp,"Habitat partitioning can promote coexistence of closely related competitors. Two congeneric shrimps (brown shrimp, Penaeus aztecus , and white shrimp, Penaeus setiferus ) which utilize estuaries in the southeastern U.S. temporally partition much of their nursery habitat occupancy but also experience a period of overlap at the respective tails of their nursery residency. Throughout nursery residency, when conspecific or congeneric abundance can be high, density-dependent (D-D) processes may alter demographic rates, but the relative importance of the potential biotic interactions occurring in these habitats (e.g., intra- and inter-specific competition, cannibalism, among others) remains underexplored. Here, we documented the periods of nursery habitat use for these two penaeid shrimp species within a representative salt marsh estuary. Next, a set of manipulative laboratory experiments was conducted to test if conspecific or congeneric density, as well as the relative proportions of each species, affect growth and mortality. In three experiments designed to simulate each of the phases of penaeid shrimp nursery habitat use (brown only, brown and white overlap, white only), shrimp were maintained at ecologically relevant densities (12.5–37.5 m -2 ) and tagged to follow growth trajectories. We found varying degrees of density-dependence between species and across response variables (length, mass, mortality), with the effect of additional species identity varying between white and brown shrimp for all three response metrics. Body size was an important predictor of mortality for both brown and white shrimp, with smaller animals exhibiting higher mortality probabilities. These results suggest that changing environmental conditions could lead to D-D impacts on some demographic rates but not others for these ecologically and economically important species during their estuarine residency.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316219,0
421,The effect of resource availability on interspecific competition between a native and an invasive ant,"Interspecific competition influences the composition of ecological communities. Species may differ in their needs for different resources, therefore resource availability may determine the outcome of interspecific interactions. Species often compete over food, shelter or both. When more than one resource is limited, different species may prioritize different resources. To determine the impact of resource availability on the competitive relationship between an invasive and a native species, we examined interactions between groups of the invasive Argentine ant ( Linepithema humile ) and the native odorous ant ( Tapinoma sessile ) over (1) food, (2) shelter or (3) both simultaneously. We further examined the mechanisms underlying the competitive relationship, asking whether aggressive interactions, exploratory behaviour or the order of arrival at a resource explained resource use. Shelter was preferred by both species when no competitors were present. In a competitive setting, L. humile groups controlled shelter through aggressive displacement but lost control over food due to investment of workers in the control of shelter. Thus, there are tradeoffs when competing over multiple resources and aggressive interactions allow invasive species to displace native species from a preferred resource. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Intergroup conflict across taxa’.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2021.0146,0
422,Resource use by juvenile brown trout and<scp>A</scp>lpine bullhead: influence of interspecific versus intraspecific competition,"Abstract Stream‐dwelling salmonids and bullheads occupy similar resource niches in northern rivers. It is therefore tempting to assume that they might be involved in a competitive interaction, with potential implications for the habitat use and growth of brown trout ( S almo trutta ). We conducted artificial‐stream experiments to test whether a putative competitor, A lpine bullhead ( C ottus poecilopus ), had an effect on the habitat use of under‐yearling (0+) and yearling (1+) trout. We hypothesised that (i) 1+ trout would be competitively superior to 0+ trout, forcing the younger fish to suboptimal habitats, and that (ii) bullhead might affect the habitat use and prey selection of 0+ trout but less so that of 1+ trout. Against our predictions, no effect of bullhead was found on the habitat use of either age class of brown trout. Instead, yearling trout seemed to force bullheads to suboptimal microhabitats with high current velocities. Presence of yearlings also decreased the growth of under‐yearling fish and caused a shift in their diet composition. These findings suggest that competitive interactions may not limit the coexistence of brown trout and bullheads in boreal rivers. Intraspecific interactions between trout age classes may be more important, with potentially detrimental effects on the growth and overwintering success of 0+ trout.",https://doi.org/10.1111/eff.12072,0
423,"Competition between cheatgrass and bluebunch wheatgrass is altered by temperature, resource availability, and atmospheric CO2 concentration","Global change drivers (elevated atmospheric CO2, rising surface temperatures, and changes in resource availability) have significant consequences for global plant communities. In the northern sagebrush steppe of North America, the invasive annual grass Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) is expected to benefit from projected warmer and drier conditions, as well as increased CO2 and nutrient availability. In growth chambers, we addressed this expectation using two replacement series experiments designed to test competition between B. tectorum and the native perennial bunchgrass Pseudoroegneria spicata. In the first experiment, we tested the effects of elevated temperature, decreased water and increased nutrient availability, on competition between the two species. In the second, we tested the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and decreased water availability on the competitive dynamic. In both experiments, under all conditions, P. spicata suppressed B. tectorum, though, in experiment one, warmer and drier conditions and elevated nutrient availability increased B. tectorum's competitiveness. In experiment two, when grown in monoculture, both species responded positively to elevated CO2. However, when grown in competition, elevated CO2 increased P. spicata's suppressive effect, and the combination of dry soil conditions and elevated CO2 enhanced this effect. Our findings demonstrate that B. tectorum competitiveness with P. spicata responds differently to global change drivers; thus, future conditions are unlikely to facilitate B. tectorum invasion into established P. spicata communities of the northern sagebrush steppe. However, disturbance (e.g., fire) to these communities, and the associated increase in soil nutrients, elevates the risk of B. tectorum invasion.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-017-4046-6,0

425,"Low Resource Competition, Availability of Nutrients and Water Level Fluctuations Facilitate Invasions of Australian Swamp Stonecrop (Crassula helmsii)","Australian swamp stonecrop (Crassula helmsii (Kirk) Cockayne) is invasive in Western Europe. Its small size and high potential for regeneration make it difficult to eliminate. Short-term experiments have demonstrated that the growth of C. helmsii depends on nutrient availability and resource competition. In order to confirm those mechanisms in the field, we studied the abundance of C. helmsii in Northern Europe over a longer period of time in relation to nutrient availability and co-occurring plant communities and plant species. C. helmsii impacted native species mainly by limiting their abundance. The native plant species present indicated that previous or periodic elevated nutrient availability were likely responsible for the proliferation of C. helmsii. When growing in submerged conditions, the dominance of C. helmsii depended on a high availability of CO2. A series of exceptionally dry summers allowed C. helmsii to increase in cover due to weakened biotic resistance and a loss of carbon limitation. Only Littorella uniflora (L.) Asch. and Juncus effusus L. were able to remain dominant and continue to provide biotic resistance. Based on our findings, minimizing nutrient (C and N) availability and optimizing hydrology provides native species with stable growth conditions. This optimizes resource competition and may prevent the proliferation of C. helmsii.",https://doi.org/10.3390/d16030172,0
426,Resource matching across habitats is limited by competition at patch scales in an estuarine-opportunist fish,"I used field observations, assays, and experiments with the euryhaline cottid Cottus aleuticus to evaluate the extent to which average resource availability drives the large-scale distribution of these fish among upstream and estuarine habitats and how interspecific competition from a congener affects its performance in the estuary. Population densities of C. aleuticus were only consistent with resource densities across years during two of five study years, indicating a lack of resource matching at large temporal scales. On shorter temporal scales, fish growth rates that were two to three times higher in the estuary compared with the stream were inconsistent with the predictions of resource matching theory. A manipulation of C. aleuticus density showed that the estuary could support at least twice the number of individuals that occurred there; thus, the profitable estuary is underutilized. Interspecific competition with Cottus asper was partially responsible for this underutilization as indicated by a substantial reduction in growth and condition among C. aleuticus individuals in experimental manipulations that compared intra- and inter-specific effects. Observed spatial overlap between these two cottids combined with the results of the competition experiment suggests that C. aleuticus is more strongly limited in its ability to use estuarine habitats opportunistically by interspecific competition than by intraspecific competition.",https://doi.org/10.1139/f04-235,0
427,Competition alters seasonal resource selection and promotes use of invasive shrubs by an imperiled native cottontail,"Many ecosystems face multiple invaders, and interactions among invasive and native species may complicate conservation efforts for imperiled species. Examination of fine-scale resource selection can be used to detect patterns in habitat selection resulting from species interactions and assess the value of specific resources, including invasive plants, to wildlife. We used animal location data with mixed-effects resource selection models to examine seasonal competitive interactions and species-specific selection for forage and cover resources by an imperiled native lagomorph, the New England cottontail Sylvilagus transitionalis and its nonnative competitor, the eastern cottontail S. floridanus in the eastern Hudson Valley, NY. We found evidence that resource selection by New England cottontails depended on the relative prevalence of eastern cottontails to New England cottontails. Where eastern cottontails were less prevalent New England cottontail selected for resources characteristic of early successional shrublands. Where eastern cottontails were more prevalent, New England cottontails selected for resources characteristic of later successional shrublands. New England cottontail use of certain invasive shrubs depended on the prevalence of eastern cottontails relative to New England cottontails, suggesting response to invasive plants is confounded by interactions with a nonnative competitor. Our results further emphasize the need for conservation efforts to consider invasive management within the ecosystem context. We demonstrate the utility of resource selection studies to assist in this regard by exploring competitive interactions in the absence of removal studies, while simultaneously assessing the impact of habitat components such as invasive vegetation on species of conservation concern. Synthesis and applications Resource selection studies can be directly applied to inform ongoing species conservation where multiple invaders are present or where species interactions influence resource selection. Fine-scale assessments of resource selection, similar to those presented here, can be used to selectively manage habitat to benefit desired species within the ecosystem context.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.4580,0
428,Resource Partitioning and Interspecific Competition Among Coexisting Species of Guans and Toucans in Se Brazil,"Between 1987 and 1998 fruit consumption and habitat use of six syntopic species of guans and toucans were studied in two Atlantic rainforest areas of southeastern Brazil: the Paranapiacaba forest fragment (140,000 ha) and the Parque Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso (22,500 ha). These two areas cover an altitudinal gradient of 0 to 1,095 m. Pipile jacutinga and the larger species of toucans (Ramphastos vitellinus and R. dicolorus) inhabit the upper levels of the forest (canopy and emergent trees), whereas Penelope obscura and the smaller toucanets (Baillonius bailloni and Selenidera maculirostris) mostly inhabit middle levels (subcanopy) and understorey. Diet composition (fruit) differed among guans and toucans and also among guan species. P. jacutinga and P. obscura tended to forage more on the fleshy fruits of Lauraceae and Myrtaceae trees, respectively, while toucans (especially B. bailloni) fed largely on palm fruits (Arecaceae). Potential congeneric competitors in the study areas are Ramphastos vitellinus ariel and R. dicolorus.

429,Effects of resource heterogeneity and environmental disturbance on the growth performance and interspecific competition of wetland clonal plants,"Resource heterogeneity significantly influences the growth, reproduction, and vegetation composition of wetland plants. However, the effect of the interaction of resource heterogeneity and environmental disturbance on growth performance and interspecific relationships among emergent plants is far from clear. In this study, we used a mesocosm experiment to examine the plasticity in clonal growth responses of Acorus calamus and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani to different levels of flooding disturbance and soil sediment heterogeneity types. Soil nutrient heterogeneity treatments did not always have a positive effect on the growth of A. calamus and S. tabernaemontani because species-specific characteristics and environmental disturbance can influence the positive effect of environmental heterogeneity on clonal plants. A. calamus exhibited longer root length, behavior advantageous for heterogeneous distributions of nutrients. To adapt to deep water habitats, A. calamus and S. tabernaemontani transform clonal growth in the horizontal direction into the vertical direction. Soil nutrient heterogeneity can cause interspecific competition between A. calamus and S. tabernaemontani. However, with increasing water level, the effects of interspecific competition on S. tabernaemontani and A. calamus decreased gradually. The two wetland species compete for heterogeneously distributed soil nutrients under low water levels. However, an increase in water level results in limited illumination, so vertical growth is employed to compete for light resources. Our results show that S. tabernaemontani and A. calamus used both plasticity strategies to cope with resource heterogeneity and environmental disturbance. These spatial and temporal variations may modify growth and vegetation stability in disturbed environments.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e00914,0
430,Root competition influences pollen competitive ability in<i>Viola tricolor</i>: effects of presence of a competitor beyond resource availability?,"Summary It has recently been suggested that not only nutrients but also presence of a competitor can influence competitive ability in plants, for example, by strategic changes in allocation to roots (a ‘tragedy of the commons’ effect). Such strategic changes might occur also in pollen, because this has potential to increase siring success during pollen competition in the pistil. I tested the new hypothesis that pollen competitive ability – a trait often strongly affected by resources of the pollen parent – was influenced by presence of a root competitor using glasshouse‐grown Viola tricolor in 2 years. Plants of two maternal families were combined in pairs with their roots either separated or intermingled in the same amount of resources. Maternal families varied in response to root competition, with pollen performance increasing in some families, decreasing in others and unchanged in others. An increase did not mirror a decrease in the competing family, suggesting an explanation beyond differential ability to gain resources. The responses to competitive environment were often consistent across three independent competitors. There was a positive correlation between family responses in pollen performance and family responses in plant size to root competitors. Larger plants did not produce better pollen per se , indicating that the change in pollen performance was not a pure side effect of altered plant size. There was no support for a ‘tragedy of the commons’ effect on root production. With the experimental design used, an effect of rooting volume could not be completely ruled out. The currently unknown mechanism of the below‐ground interactions between plants of V. tricolor was strong enough to change relative pollen competitive ability. These interactions might thus promote variation in the outcome of pollen competition. Synthesis. The results of this study indicate the presence of a competitor on pollen competitive ability beyond the effect of nutrients. Even though the underlying mechanism needs to be explored further, the detected link between pollen competition and soil competition suggests a phenomenon well worth investigating. Further studies may lead to increased understanding of the evolutionary consequences of selection operating in response to interactions with neighbours.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2008.01387.x,0
431,Dietary resource use and competition between white-tailed deer and introduced sika deer,"Content Native communities of herbivores have evolved fundamental dietary niches that avoid or minimise competition; the introduction of exotic species can change dietary niches, cause overlap in resource use, and result in competition for resources. Aims We compared niche breadth, overlap in diet, and quality of diet between introduced sika deer and native white-tailed deer in Maryland, USA. We investigated these changes in free-ranging populations where both species are allopatric as well as when they are sympatric. Methods We used microhistological analysis of faecal samples to determine the percentage of resources used by sika deer and white-tailed deer, as measured between geographical areas of similar habitat quality. We compared resource use specifically by controlling for harvest pressure and resource availability, which are known to alter resource use other than the presence of an additional deer species. Key results We observed a significant resource overlap (range 63–88%) between species. In the presence of sika deer, white-tailed deer displayed an increased niche breadth (108%) and a lower diet quality (17%). Sika deer consumed the same resources that comprised 78% of white-tailed deer diet. Unlike other native ungulates that have dietary overlap with white-tailed deer, sika deer is neither temporally nor geographically segregated in habitat use. Conclusions Resource overlap and changes in niche breadth and diet quality during sympatry strongly denote dietary competition between sika deer and white-tailed deer. This competition results in white-tailed deer altering the dietary selection, thereby consuming lower-quality forage. Implications White-tailed deer are concentrate selectors and require higher diet quality than do sika deer, which can tolerate diets higher in fibre, consistent with their classification as intermediate feeders. A decrease in the nutritional quality of resources used by white-tailed deer could contribute to the decline of white-tailed deer over time and allow the continued spread of sika deer.",https://doi.org/10.1071/wr17125,0
432,Plant zonation in a brackish tidal marsh: descriptive verification of resource-based competition and community structure,"This study examined the hypothesis that the zonal patterns of dominant species in brackish tidal marshes may be explained by resource competition for soil nitrogen and light. This hypothesis was tested by analyzing abiotic and biotic field data collected from a brackish tidal marsh located at Brunswick Point, British Columbia. Biotic data revealed that this tidal marsh is dominated by two species that occupy distinct separate zones correlated to marsh elevation. In particular, sites whose elevation was from −0.80 to 0.20 m (geodetic datum) were dominated by Scirpus americanus, while sites with an elevation 0.20 m were dominated by Carex lyngbyei. Analysis of the relationships between measured variables indicated that total species biomass, species height, and total soil nitrogen were all positively correlated to sample site elevation. Further, the availability of light at the soil surface was found to be negatively correlated to plant biomass and site elevation. These results may suggest that S. americanus is dominant in the low marsh because it is a better competitor for soil nitrogen. Carex lyngbyei may be competitively dominant in the high marsh because its greater biomass and height make it a superior competitor for light. Key words: competition, light, nitrogen, tidal marshes, zonation.",https://doi.org/10.1139/b90-217,0
433,Density dynamics of bumblebees in subalpine meadows: competition and resource limitation,"Densities of Bombus flavifrons and B. rufocinctus were measured over one summer in 23 and 11 discrete subalpine meadows, respectively. I assessed the relation between observed bee densities and meadow size, elevation, floristics, temperature, and time of day by multiple regression. Multivariate regression solutions for each week of observation accounted for 38 to 61% of the variation in density for B. flavifrons and 47 to 87% for B. rufocinctus . Temperature or time of day consistently accounted for the most variation in density of the two species. In early summer meadow size or elevation also accounted for a large proportion of explained variation in B. flavifrons density; as the summer progressed meadow floristics increasingly contributed to the explanation of variation in both species. In mid‐ to late summer a statistically significant portion of the variation in densities not explained by habitat characteristics was accounted for by densities of congeners: i.e., densities of B. flavifrons and B. rufocinctus were negatively related in eight meadows where they co‐occurred. In experimental meadows where all Bombus but one of the two target species were removed. B. rufocinctus underwent significant positive density compensation but B. flavifrons did not. To the extent that B. flavifrons appeared to limit the density of B. rufocinctus these statistical and experimental results are consistent with the hypothesis that competition limits local bumblebee densities.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1986.tb01207.x,0
434,"Narrow Dietary Niche With High Overlap Between Snow Leopards and Himalayan Wolves Indicates Potential for Resource Competition in Shey Phoksundo National Park, Nepal","ABSTRACT Understanding species' dietary ecology and interspecific interactions is crucial for multi‐species conservation planning. In Central Asia and the Himalayas, wolves have recolonized snow leopard habitats, raising considerable concern about resource competition between these apex predators. Using micro‐histological analysis of prey species remains (e.g., hair) in their fecal samples, we determined the prey composition, dietary niche breadth, and the extent of diet overlap between these two apex predators in Shey Phoksundo National Park, Nepal. We analyzed 152 scat samples collected along 89 survey transects from April to June 2021. Our findings reveal a significant overlap in their diets (Pianka's index = 0.93), with snow leopard and wolf scats containing the remains of 11 and 10 prey species, respectively. However, the interspecific difference in prey selection was apparent, with significant deviations between observed and expected prey use indicating non‐random prey selection relative to availability: Snow leopards exhibited a higher occurrence of wild prey items in their diet (55.28%), primarily blue sheep ( Pseudois nayaur ) (24.83%), whereas wolves relied predominantly on domestic livestock (67.89%), with goats ( Capra hircus ) accounting for over one‐fourth of their diet (29.15%). Yaks ( Bos grunniens ) comprised a significant portion of the biomass consumed by both predators, with higher for wolves (43.68%) than snow leopards (36.47%). Overall, the narrow dietary niche breadth with high overlap indicates potential resource competition between snow leopards and wolves. However, a comprehensive understanding of resource competition will require further study on other axes of niche partitioning, including habitat and time. Nevertheless, the region's low prey richness means that, with increasing human influence, any reduction in wild prey or increase in livestock could intensify competition between snow leopards and wolves, which could have implications for livestock depredation.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.70873,0
435,Trait-Mediated Effects of Parasitic Phorid Flies (Diptera: Phoridae) on Ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) Competition and Resource Access in Coffee Agro-ecosystems,"Predator effects on prey traits change competitive interactions between prey species affecting resource use. Parasitic phorid flies limit competitive-dominant ant activity, potentially meditating competitive interactions between ant species, changing competitive hierarchies, or affecting ant communities. I considered interactions between phorids (Pseudacteon sp.), their ant host (Azteca instabilis F. Smith), and co-occurring ant species in coffee agro-ecosystems testing whether phorids (1) limit A. instabilis recruitment activity, (2) affect competitive interaction between ant species, and (3) are associated with other species' resource access and therefore have the potential to change competitive hierarchies. I monitored recruitment of A. instabilis and other ants to baits over 90 min on canopy trees with or without phorids. A. instabilis were one-half as abundant with phorids. Other species gained access to baits 12 times more often and were only able to take over baits when phorids were present. Furthermore, many more species (13 versus 2) gained access to resources when phorids were present. These results indicate that phorids mediate competitive interactions between ant species and may influence ant communities by affecting resource availability. Considering that phorids limit A. instabilis attacks on herbivores and that ant species differ in effects on arthropod communities, phorids may have strong community-level effects in coffee agro-ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ee/34.5.1089,0
436,Ecological competition based resource control for sustainable heterogeneous wireless networks,"In a heterogeneous wireless network (HWN), users from multiple networks with various QoS requirements compete with each other for finite resources. As this competition becomes intense, the distribution of resources may become extremely haphazard, thus making users of certain classes to be disadvantaged over others. This may destabilize the HWNs and even lead certain classes of users requiring relatively higher resources into complete extinction. Hence, the key for a sustainable HWN is a resource management scheme, which fairly allocates all network resources. Therefore, in this paper, first we propose an analytical model to characterize such unfairness and instability in HWNs. This approach is based on the theory of ecological multi-species multi-resource competition (MSMRC). Next, to counter the aforementioned instability and unfairness, we propose a new joint radio resource management (JRRM) scheme, MSMRC scheme, which is capable of ensuring the HWN's stability and maintain the coexistence of users of widely diverse requirements, even under the extreme situations. Results indicate that the MSMRC scheme also supports the sustainability of the HWN by helping it to withstand sudden disruptions.",https://doi.org/10.1109/pimrc.2011.6139724,0
437,Consumer Effects on the Vital Rates of Their Resource Can Determine the Outcome of Competition between Consumers,"Current competition theory does not adequately address the fact that competitors may affect the survival, growth, and reproductive rates of their resources. Ecologically important interactions in which consumers affect resource vital rates range from parasitism and herbivory to mutualism. We present a general model of competition that explicitly includes consumer-dependent resource vital rates. We build on the classic MacArthur model of competition for multiple resources, allowing direct comparison with expectations from established concepts of resource-use overlap. Consumers share a stage-structured resource population but may use the different stages to different extents, as they do the different independent resources in the classic model. Here, however, the stages are dynamically linked via consumer-dependent vital rates. We show that consumers’ effects on resource vital rates result in two important departures from classic results. First, consumers can coexist despite identical use of resource stages, provided each competitor shifts the resource stage distribution toward stages that benefit other species. Second, consumers specializing on different resource stages can compete strongly, possibly resulting in competitive exclusion despite a lack of resource stage-use overlap. Our model framework demonstrates the critical role that consumer-dependent resource vital rates can play in competitive dynamics in a wide range of biological systems.",https://doi.org/10.1086/661986,0
438,"Defoliation, nitrogen, and competition: effects on plant growth and resource allocation of <i>Cleistogenes squarrosa</i> and <i>Artemisia frigida</i>","Abstract Two species, Artemisia frigida Willd. (C 3 , semishrub, and dominant on overgrazed sites) and Cleistogenes squarrosa (Trin.) Keng (C 4 , perennial bunchgrass, and dominant or codominant on moderately grazed sites) were studied to determine the effects of defoliation, nitrogen (N) availability, competition, and their interactions on growth, biomass, and N allocation in a greenhouse experiment. The main treatments were: two nitrogen levels (N0 = 0 mg N pot –1 , N1 = 60 mg N pot –1 ), two defoliation intensities (removing 60% of total aboveground biomass and no defoliation), and three competitive replacement series (monocultures of each species and mixtures at 0.5:0.5). Our results were inconsistent with our hypothesis on the adaptive mechanisms of A. frigida regarding the interactive effects of herbivory, N, and competition in determining its dominant position on overgrazed sites. Cleistogenes squarrosa will be replaced by A. frigida on overgrazed sites, although C. squarrosa had higher tolerance to defoliation than did A. frigida. Total biomass and N yield and 15 N recovery of C. squarrosa in mixed culture were consistently lower than in monocultures, whereas those of A. frigida grown in mixtures were consistently higher than in monocultures, suggesting higher competitive ability of A. frigida. Our results suggest that interspecific competitive ability may be of equal or greater importance than herbivory tolerance in determining herbivore‐induced species replacement in semi‐arid Inner Mongolian steppe. In addition, the dominance of A. frigida on overgrazed sites has been attributed to its ability to shift plant‐plant interactions through gap colonization, root niche differentiation, and higher resistance to water stress.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jpln.200625104,0
439,Collective foraging: Experimentally increased competition decreases group performance exploiting a permanent resource,"Abstract Foraging collectively offers advantages, such as access to social information on food locations, but it may also intensify competition for local resources. Social information may be most advantageous during ecologically challenging conditions, when food sources are scarce or unpredictable, which predicts more collective foraging during such conditions. Alternatively, higher within‐group competition when resources are scarce might destabilize social groups and reduce collective foraging. To evaluate these effects, we experimentally decreased the number and predictability of food sources (feeders with ad libitum seeds) available to wild‐caught common waxbills Estrilda astrild living in a large open‐air mesocosm. Compared to control periods, in the treatment with few food sources competitive aggressiveness at feeders increased, the social network became more fragmented, with on average weaker associations between individuals, and foraging groups became smaller. Foraging groups also spent less time per visit to the feeding area, individuals spent less time at the feeders per group visit and had to make more visits to the feeding area per day, all of which indicate less efficient exploitation of the food sources. These effects were also observed when the number of feeders changed unpredictably across days. Even though the collective behaviour of waxbills appeared to exacerbate, rather than mitigate, the ecological challenges of reduced or unpredictable food sources, we suggest that, in nature, this increased aggressiveness and fragmentation of the social network may function adaptively as an early trigger to explore alternative foraging locations before local food sources are severely depleted.

440,Mating competition and parentage assessment in Ptomascopus morio (Coleoptera: Silphidae): A case for resource defense polygyny,"Ptomascopus morio of both sexes are attracted to vertebrate carcasses, a necessary resource for reproduction.The stage during reproduction that resource defense was most intense and the hypothesis that large beetles were better competitors and sired a larger share of the offspring were supported and tested.Male-male aggression (pushing, biting and mounting) was commonly observed before and during oviposition, but rarely after the larvae hatched.Few female-female aggressive interactions were observed at any time.Parentage analysis of the offspring of six groups of two males and two females each reproducing on a separate carcass revealed that the large males sired more of the offspring than small males.Paternity analysis, using AFLP markers, revealed that larger males had higher paternity than smaller males, but the number of eggs produced by each female did not differ between large and small females.This suggests that competition among males is intense until the end of oviposition and that resident (large) males can acquire more mates and sire more offspring than smaller males; competition among females was not evident at any time.",https://doi.org/10.14411/eje.2006.099,0
441,Cooperation or competition : dilemma for resource managers in sustainable wildlife utilisation,"Keywords: analytical modelling; Associated Private Nature Reserves; consumptive use; elephants; Kruger National Park; land productivity; non-consumptive use; waterpoints; Savanna ecosystem model; South Africa. Wildlife as part of biodiversity is a global natural resource. However, landowners have some control over the future of wildlife on their land. Wildlife could be managed by the state or private landowners. The survival of the wildlife and their habitats is determined by how these landowners decide to use the land and the renewable resources on it. Some complication come into place given that wildlife usually roam on land held over by more than one owner providing more challenge to its management. In addition, wildlife as a natural resource has multiple uses that generate revenues for the betterment of the landowners. The uses could be consumptive or non-consumptive. Each landowner has multiple objectives which might be conflicting which poses even a greater challenge to the sustainable wildlife management. To meet their objectives wildlife managers use management tools. Some of the tools used include constructing or closing of artificial waterpoints, fire management, fencing, and population manipulation through culling/hunting or translocation of animals. However, use of these management tools can lead to unintended or opposite effects if they are not well understood. There are direct and indirect effects of the tools on biodiversity. Landowners could be tempted to excessively use some of the tools in order to achieve their objectives. In addition, most studies have concentrated on either the ecological or economic effects of the wildlife management tools. For the landowner, it is essential that he comprehends both the ecological and economic effects of the wildlife management tools for the sustainable management of wildlife, a contribution of this study. The main objective of this study is to assess the ecological and economic implications of some wildlife management tools on the landowners’ welfare. I use simple ecological economic analytical models based on the Pontryagin’s maximum principle to perform the analyses. The Savanna ecosystem model which is a spatially explicit, process-oriented model is also used to further explore the effects of one of the wildlife management tools on landowner’s multiple objectives. One of the tools that is analyzed in this thesis is the improvement of land productivity through increasing of vegetation quality. Given that, it is usually not easy to increase the land size in response to increased incentives, some landowners might consider increasing the land productivity. The results show that utilization of wildlife can contribute to wildlife conservation and enhancement of welfare as a result of investment by landowners into habitat quality improvement. However, the use of a wildlife management tool has direct and indirect effects as demonstrated by another framework presented in this thesis on waterpoints. Waterpoints are used by wildlife managers to supplement natural water supplies which in turn support herbivore populations, like elephants. A private oriented landowner may be interested only in maximization of profits or personal benefits either from elephant offtake and/or tourism revenue, thus might ignore the negative effects that could be brought about by elephants to biodiversity. In such case, the game reserve management as the authority entrusted with sustainable management of the game reserve should use economic instruments such as subsidies or payments for the compliant landowners and/or taxes or charges for the non-compliant landowners to encourage compliance with sustainable wildlife management practices. The Savanna ecosystem model is used to explore the effects of waterpoints on elephant density (representing an economic objective) and biodiversity (representing an ecological objective). The model is used to analyze the differential impact of waterpoints on the Kruger National Park’s regions under 26 waterpoints manipulation scenarios. The model is also used to analyze elephant impact on vegetation biomass diversity in four regions of Kruger National Park. The results showed that constructing (or closing) extra waterpoints in one region does not necessarily translate into higher (or lower) elephant densities in that region, but the effect depends on the vegetation and other conditions of the region in comparison to neighbouring regions. In one of the regions, the model showed that there is a trade-off between elephant density and vegetation biomass diversity. In another region, elephants’ effect on vegetation biomass diversity follows the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, whilst in other regions the relationship is positive. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis postulates that there would be a higher diversity of vegetation structure at intermediate elephant densities whilst at extreme levels of both low and high disturbance the diversity would be reduced. The model thus suggests that different strategies should be adopted for different regions, e.g., an adaptive management strategy could be used for one of the regions where waterpoints are switched on and off depending on the elephant density. Another wildlife management tool that is analyzed is the use of physical barriers like fences. Physical barriers could be utilised by landowners to separate different wildlife uses which might be conflicting. Landowners or game reserve management are often faced with the decision whether to undertake consumptive (hunting) and/or non-consumptive (tourism) use on their properties. A theoretical model is constructed to examine these cases. The results show that that the two uses can be undertaken in the same contiguous area if the consumptive use is not dominating. In conclusion, what emerges from this work is that given that the landowner’s welfare is not only affected by his own actions but also his neighbours’ modi operandi, then the landowner should consider all levels of cooperation with his neighbours in order to fully maximize his welfare. This includes cooperation in terms of which management tool(s) he and/or his neighbour should use. The frameworks presented in this thesis could be used by landowners (both state and private) to analyze the effects of their management actions on their welfare.",https://doi.org/10.18174/176001,0
442,Individual Variation in Trophic Egg Production: Evidence for Maternal Manipulation in Response to Resource and Competition Levels,"Abstract Females of the subsocial shield bug Parastrachia japonensis (Heteroptera: Parastrachiidae) incorporate trophic eggs (nutritive eggs) into their egg mass. Considerable variation occurs among females in trophic egg number and the proportion of an egg mass that is composed of trophic eggs. Because trophic eggs are essential to the development and survival of young, this variation could significantly impact female fitness. We tested the hypothesis that trophic egg abundance is induced by maternal phenotype (weight, body size) and resource exposure. We predicted that resource limitations would cause females to produce fewer fertile eggs and more trophic eggs and that larger and heavier females would produce more of each egg type. Females ovipositing early in the season are exposed to different resource conditions than those that oviposit late. Thus, we compared egg production patterns between these two groups and several other factors related to nesting. No correlation was seen between body size and trophic egg abundance, or, indeed, egg production, overall; however, heavier females produced heavier egg masses. Counter to our prediction, late females, which had greater access to food, produced significantly more total eggs, fewer fertile eggs, and more trophic eggs than early females. A binomial generalized linear model analysis indicated that the factors most correlated with the percentage of an egg mass destined to become trophic eggs were resource abundance, resulting from early or late oviposition, and distance of the nest from the host tree, with closer females producing more trophic eggs. The findings support our hypothesis that resource availability and, to a lesser extent, maternal phenotype affect trophic egg abundance.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0310.2012.02039.x,0
443,"Response of a mesocarnivore community to a new food resource: recognition, exploitation, and interspecific competition","Abstract Mammalian carnivores with generalist feeding behaviour should trace and exploit new and predictable food resources quicker and more easily than more specialised species. On the other hand, if the new food resource is spatially and temporally predictable, interference or exploitation competition should arise among members of the carnivore guild, with the expectation that smaller species will not use the food resource or will change their foraging behaviour to avoid conflict with larger species. Here, we studied the response to a new food resource of a mammalian mesocarnivore community in south-western Iberian Peninsula. We installed artificial feeding points supplied with a novel food source and tracked them by camera trapping to investigate whether (1) the new artificial food resource was visited, recognised and exploited by the mesocarnivore guild species; (2) how frequently they used the food; and (3) in case of co-occurrence, if dominant species excluded or reduced the feeding options of subordinates. All target species except the badger recognised and exploited the novel food. More generalist species trended to visit feeding points more frequently and spent more time feeding than less generalist species, even though significant differences were not achieved in all cases. When co-occurring at the same feeding point, the arrival of larger species reduced either the visitation rates, feeding probability or time spent feeding of smaller species. Moreover, some smaller species showed a shift in their normal activity pattern at the feeding points when a larger competitor started to use the food source. Overall, we conclude that active avoidance combined with temporal segregation may help reduce agonistic interactions among competitors for shared resources.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10344-022-01597-4,0
444,Resource partitioning and exploitative competition in stem-galling midges mediated by the host plant,"Abstract Izeniola obesula Dorchin and Stefaniola defoliata Dorchin (Diptera, Cecidomyiidae) are two cecidomyiid species inducing multichambered galls in young shoots of the salt marsh plant, Suaeda monoica Gmelin (Chenopodiaceae). The purpose of this work was to study the relationship between the two species, which co‐occur in time and space, and may therefore potentially compete for plant resources. Characterization of the resources available to ovipositing females revealed that shoots in apical positions are more vigorous than shoots in basal positions, but that the two species of gall midges react to this variability of resources in different ways, as reflected by the patterns of gall distribution. Izeniola obesula galls were primarily induced in the younger, more rapidly growing shoots, whereas those of S. defoliata were predominantly induced in older, less vigorous shoots. Nevertheless, despite the general partitioning of resources, a certain amount of niche overlap was found, resulting in the occasional induction of an S. defoliata gall proximal to that of I. obesula in the same shoot. Co‐occurrence of the two types of galls in time and space did not have apparent effect on S. defoliata galls, but did have a strong adverse impact on young I. obesula galls, 60% of which were killed without producing adult midges, and the remaining 40% produced a much smaller number of adults. These effects are attributed to asymmetric interspecific competition that is mediated by the plant, resulting from the difference in stem tissues utilized by the larvae of the two species. It is concluded that preponderance of vacant niches, low densities of galls, and small niche overlap between the species do not preclude the occurrence of interspecific exploitative competition in this system, although its role in shaping the populations of the species is limited.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2006.00364.x,0
445,"Dynamic competition and resource partitioning during the early life of two widespread, abundant and ecologically similar fishes","Abstract Competition and resource partitioning can have profound implications for individuals, populations and communities, and thus food webs, ecosystems and the management of biota and environments. In many species, the impacts of competition and resource partitioning are believed to be most severe during early life, but our understanding of the mechanisms and implications is incomplete. This study revealed short-term variations in both the occurrence and direction of competition during the early life of roach Rutilus rutilus and common bream Abramis brama , two of the most widespread and abundant fish species in Europe. There was also evidence of resource partitioning when small taxa dominated the zooplankton, but not when larger taxa were more abundant. In spite of the differences in foraging ecology, there were no significant differences in growth or nutritional condition in allopatry and sympatry. Similar to the concept of condition-specific competition, when competitive abilities vary along environmental gradients, the impacts of interspecific interactions on foraging ecology, growth and condition are dynamic and likely vary according to temporal fluctuations in prey availability. This is important because short-term incidences of competition could have cascading effects on food webs, even when no impacts on growth rates or condition are detected.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04247-5,0
446,"Resource partitioning and asymmetric competition between sympatric freshwater and Omono types of ninespine stickleback,<i>Pungitius pungitius</i>","The freshwater and Omono types of ninespine stickleback, Pungitius pungitius (L., 1758), coexist in several ponds and a stream in the Omono River system, Japan. We tested the hypothesis that coexistence of the two types is accomplished by resource partitioning through interspecific competition. First, the stomach contents of the two types were compared between sympatric and allopatric populations: the stomach contents of the sympatric freshwater type consisted of almost all Copepoda, whereas those of the sympatric Omono type consisted of not only Copepoda, but also many large benthic invertebrates; the stomach contents of both allopatric types were similar, consisting of Copepoda and large benthic invertebrates. Second, behaviour related to resource use in a sympatric pond was observed in the nonbreeding season: the freshwater type showed little aggressive behaviour, but the Omono type had a high frequency of aggressive behaviour. These results indicate that the sympatric freshwater type does not hold a feeding territory and its food resource is almost all Copepoda, whereas the Omono type has a feeding territory and its food resources are various. This suggests that asymmetric interference competition causes a diet shift of the sympatric freshwater type, allowing the two types to coexist by their resource partitioning.",https://doi.org/10.1139/z06-207,0
447,"Using silvicultural practices to regulate competition, resource availability, and growing conditions for <i>Pinus palustris</i> seedlings underplanted in <i>Pinus taeda</i> forests","In the southeastern United States, many forest managers are interested in restoring longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) to upland sites that currently support loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.). We quantified the effects of four canopy treatments (uncut Control; MedBA, harvest to 9 m 2 ·ha −1 ; LowBA, harvest to 5 m 2 ·ha −1 ; and Clearcut) and three cultural treatments (NT, no treatment; H, herbicide release of longleaf pine seedlings; and H+F, herbicide release plus fertilization) on resource availability and growing conditions in relation to longleaf pine seedling response for 3 years. Harvesting treatments reduced competition from canopy trees but resulted in greater abundance of understory vegetation. Harvesting shifted the interception of light from the canopy to the subcanopy vegetation layer; however, total light availability at the forest floor increased with the intensity of canopy removal. Soil moisture was not affected by harvesting or by the cultural treatments. Foliar nutrient concentrations (N, P, and K) of longleaf pine seedlings generally increased with the intensity of the harvest treatment. Of the plant resources measured, we found that light was most strongly correlated with longleaf pine seedling growth and that incorporating the interception of light by subcanopy vegetation improved the relationship over that of canopy light transmittance alone.",https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2016-0066,0
448,Non-local competition drives both rapid divergence and prolonged stasis in a model of speciation in populations with degenerate resource consumption,"The theory of speciation is dominated by adaptationist thinking, with less attention to mechanisms that do not affect species adaptation. Degeneracy--the imperfect specificity of interactions between diverse elements of biological systems and their environments--is key to the adaptability of populations. A mathematical model was explored in which population and resource were distributed one-dimensionally according to trait value. Resource consumption was degenerate--neither strictly location-specific nor location-independent. As a result, the competition for resources among the elements of the population was non-local. Two modeling approaches, a modified differential-integral Verhulstian equation and a cellular automata model, showed similar results: narrower degeneracy led to divergent dynamics with suppression of intermediate forms, whereas broader degeneracy led to suppression of diversifying forms, resulting in population stasis with increasing phenotypic homogeneity. Such behaviors did not increase overall adaptation because they continued after the model populations achieved maximal resource consumption rates, suggesting that degeneracy-driven distributed competition for resources rather than selective pressure toward more efficient resource exploitation was the driving force. The solutions were stable in the presence of limited environmental stochastic variability or heritable phenotypic variability. A conclusion was made that both dynamic diversification and static homogeneity of populations may be outcomes of the same process--distributed competition for resource not affecting the overall adaptation--with the difference between them defined by the spread of trait degeneracy in a given environment. Thus, biological degeneracy is a driving force of both speciation and stasis in biology, which, by themselves, are not necessarily adaptive in nature.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4682-9-56,0
449,"Resource utilization, competition and cannibalism of the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii in integrated rice-crayfish culture without artificial diets","In a 95-day, integrated rice-crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) culture experiment, the changes in the contribution of feed sources, intra-sexual isotopic niche width, inter-sexual isotopic niche overlap, and potential competition were analyzed. The contribution of plants available for crayfish decreased over the culturing time, whereas the contribution of animal feed sources increased accordingly, and that of the cannibalized feed sources increased initially and then decreased. In contrast, the contribution of detritus as a feed source decreased initially and then increased. Female crayfish made higher contributions to inter-sexual cannibalism than intra-sexual cannibalism on August 28 and September 24, whereas these contributions were higher for male crayfish on September 24 and October 20. Double inter-sexual cannibalism occurred in the middle and later periods of the trial. The isotopic niche of crayfish ascend in the direction of the δ15N axis on September 24 and then decreased and contracted by October 20. The isotopic niche of males and the total population decreased over culturing time, occupying a larger isotopic niche than females at the same time point, and the isotopic niche of males decreased more slowly than that of females. The inter-sexual overlap of the isotopic niches decreased initially and then increased. The contribution of inter-sexual cannibalism was the highest, and the inter-sexual overlap of the isotopic niches was lowest on September 24. Moderate inter-sexual cannibalism could reduce inter-sexual overlap of the isotopic niche and potential competition for resources. This study is the first to investigate the feed sources and intra- and inter-sexual isotopic niches of P. clarkii in rice fields without artificial diets for crayfish, with a view to providing insights for further research on the interplay between cannibalism and competition between male and female crayfish.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.100644,0
450,Pollinator competition and the contingency of nectar depletion during an early spring resource pulse,"Concerns about competition between pollinators are predicated on the assumption of floral resource limitation. Floral resource limitation, however, is a complex phenomenon involving the interplay of resource production by plants, resource demand by pollinators, and exogenous factors-like weather conditions-that constrain both plants and pollinators. In this study, we examined nectar limitation during the mass flowering of rosaceous fruit trees in early spring. Our study was set in the same region as a previous study that found severe nectar limitation in summer grasslands. We used this seasonal contrast to evaluate two alternative hypotheses concerning the seasonal dynamics of floral resource limitation: either (H1) rates of resource production and consumption are matched through seasonal time to maintain a consistent degree of resource limitation, or (H2) a mismatch of high floral resource production and low pollinator activity in early spring creates a period of relaxed resource limitation that intensifies later in the year. We found generally much lower depletion in our spring study compared to the near 100% depletion found in the summer study, but depletion rates varied markedly through diel time and across sampling days, with afternoon depletion rates sometimes exceeding 80%. In some cases, there were also pronounced differences in depletion rates across simultaneously sampled floral species, indicating different degrees of nectar exploitation. These findings generally support the seasonal mismatch hypothesis (H2) but underscore the complex contingency of nectar depletion. The challenge of future work is to discern how the fluctuation of resource limitation across diel, inter-diel, and seasonal time scales translates into population-level outcomes for pollinators.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.11531,0
451,Evaluation of food competition and resource partitioning of recruiting fish with permanent residents in a seagrass habitat,"Recruiting King George whiting Sillaginodes punctatus were studied to assess the potential for food competition with permanent resident fish species in a nursery habitat. Marine migrant post larval S. punctatus (<60 mm TL) consumed primarily harpacticoid copepods and had high (>0.6) diet overlap with permanent resident fish species Favonigobius leteralis and Stigmatopora nigra. Food electivity index indicated that S. punctatus juveniles preferred harpacticoid copepods and amphipods, while juvenile Heteroclinus adelaide and Gymnapistes marmoratus migrating to the nursery habitat targeted larger prey such as amphipods. Preference for larger prey by H. adelaide and G. marmoratus species coupled with differences in prey composition in the stomach was due to mouth size and feeding habits, resulting in different food preferences to S. punctatus. The whiting showed an ontogenetic shift in diet with early settlers (>60 mm TL) consuming less copepods and more amphipods, while previous year recruits (>120 mm TL) consumed polychaete worms. This study indicates that competition for food resources between the new recruiting S. punctatus juveniles and permanent resident juveniles is reduced through differences in temporal and spatial feeding behaviours, mouth morphology, and ontogenetic shift in prey consumption.",https://doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2019.1661259,0
452,Competition strategies driving resource partitioning in chitin degrading communities,"Resource competition strongly shapes microbial community dynamics and function. In polysaccharide-degrading communities, primary degraders secrete monomer-releasing enzymes and exploiters consume released products without investing in enzymes. By investigating competitive strategies between chitin degraders and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) exploiters, we uncover several interacting factors, including GlcNAc liberation rates, diffusive loss, and resource partitioning between competitors, which determine community viability and growth dynamics at early stages of degradation. Aside from cases involving antibiotic secretion or aggregation on particles to privatize degrading enzymes, exploiters also inhibit degraders by siphoning away limiting GlcNAc flux during early stages of particle degradation, when degraders must overcome diffusive GlcNAc loss to sustain chitinase production. Analogous to the Allee effect in population biology, these effects lead to sensitive dependences on initial species densities for a community to thrive. This study elucidates how metabolic competition at early stages of particle degradation shapes species interactions, resource partitioning, and ultimately community viability.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.07.622309,0
453,"Root competition influences pollen competitive ability in Viola tricolor, effects of presence of a competitor beyond resource availability?","1. It has recently been suggested that not only nutrients but also presence of a competitor can influence competitive ability in plants, for example, by strategic changes in allocation to roots (a 'tragedy of the commons' effect). Such strategic changes might occur also in pollen, because this has potential to increase siring success during pollen competition in the pistil. 2. I tested the new hypothesis that pollen competitive ability a trait often strongly affected by resources of the pollen parent was influenced by presence of a root competitor using glasshouse grown Viola tricolor in 2 years. Plants of two maternal families were combined in pairs with their roots either separated or intermingled in the same amount of resources. 3. Maternal families varied in response to root competition, with pollen performance increasing in some families, decreasing in others and unchanged in others. An increase did not mirror a decrease in the competing family, suggesting an explanation beyond differential ability to gain resources. The responses to competitive environment were often consistent across three independent competitors. 4. There was a positive correlation between family responses in pollen performance and family responses in plant size to root competitors. Larger plants did not produce better pollen per se, indicating that the change in pollen performance was not a pure side effect of altered plant size. There was no support for a 'tragedy of the commons' effect on root production. With the experi mental design used, an effect of rooting volume could not be completely ruled out. 5. The currently unknown mechanism of the below-ground interactions between plants of V. tricolor was strong enough to change relative pollen competitive ability. These interactions might thus promote variation in the outcome of pollen competition. 6. Synthesis. The results of this study indicate the presence of a competitor on pollen competitive ability beyond the effect of nutrients. Even though the underlying mechanism needs to be explored further, the detected link between pollen competition and soil competition suggests a phenomenon well worth investigating. Further studies may lead to increased understanding of the evolutionary consequences of selection operating in response to interactions with neighbours.",,0
454,"Resource Variation Within and Between Patches: Where Exploitation Competition, Local Adaptation, and Kin Selection Meet","In patch- or habitat-structured populations, different processes can favor adaptive polymorphism at different scales. While spatial heterogeneity can generate spatially disruptive selection favoring variation between patches, local competition can lead to locally disruptive selection promoting variation within patches. So far, almost all theory has studied these two processes in isolation. Here, we use mathematical modeling to investigate how resource variation within and between habitats influences the evolution of variation in a consumer population where individuals compete in finite patches connected by dispersal. We find that locally and spatially disruptive selection typically act in concert, favoring polymorphism under a wider range of conditions than when in isolation. But when patches are small and dispersal between them is low, kin competition inhibits the emergence of polymorphism, especially when the latter is driven by local competition for resources. We further use our model to clarify what comparisons between trait and neutral genetic differentiation (QST/FST comparisons) can tell about the nature of selection. Overall, our results help us understand the interaction between two major drivers of polymorphism: locally and spatially disruptive selection, and how this interaction is modulated by the unavoidable effects of kin selection under limited dispersal.",https://doi.org/10.1086/727483,0
455,"From apparent competition to facilitation, impacts of consumer niche construction on the coexistence and stability of consumer-resource communities","Summary In addition to their direct trophic effects, some consumers have a positive indirect effect on their resource, due to niche construction. A predator can facilitate its prey resource acquisition, through prey transport, or through modifications of nutrient cycling. Other predators defend their prey against other predators, or actively manage it, as in agriculture, which is found in numerous taxa such as humans, but also ants, beetles, fishes and microbes. Here we investigate the ecological consequences of considering such positive effects in a simple two resource–one predator module, in which the consumer has a positive effect on one of the resources. We consider several scenarios, in which the positive effect of the resource is either non costly, ie resulting from a by-product of the consumer phenotype such as nutrient cycling, or costly. The cost either decreases the exploitation of the helped resource or the opportunity to forage the alternative resource. We show that by modifying the trophic interactions in the module, niche construction alters the apparent competition between the resources, thereby impacting their coexistence. We investigate how the intensity of niche construction impacts species coexistence, the distribution of biomass among the three species, and the stability of the community. When niche construction has little or no cost, it leads to higher consumer and helped resource densities, while decreasing the alternative resource density. Alternatively, when niche construction has a strong cost, the alternative resource can increase in density, niche construction thereby leading to the emergence of facilitative interactions among resource species.",https://doi.org/10.1101/332437,0
456,Resource diversity mitigates the effects of intraspecific competition in co-occurring cryptic nematode species,"Intraspecific competition and resource diversity are considered major drivers of niche differentiation, which are expected to promote population niche expansion by driving individuals to feed on alternative resources and/or by enhancing individual diet specialization. Nevertheless, experimental studies on the interaction effects of both factors on animal behavior and population dynamics remain scant. Here, we investigate how resource diversity alters the impact of intraspecific competition on resource preference and fitness of three co-occurring cryptic species of the marine nematode complex Litoditis marina (Pm I, Pm III and Pm IV). For each cryptic species, two competition regimes (‘low nematode density’ and ‘high nematode density’) were established in microcosms with varying resource diversity ( E. coli , low-, medium- and high-diversity food). Our results show differences in resource preference and population fitness depending on intraspecific competition and resource diversity, but the response also varied considerably between cryptic species. Pm III did not exhibit resource preference under low intraspecific competition, but preferred the two most diverse food sources under high intraspecific competition. Pm IV also showed preference for medium-diversity food under high competition, whereas no resource preference was observed in Pm I regardless of competition regimes and resource diversity. Nevertheless, all cryptic species exhibited enhanced adult population growth on a more diverse food source under stronger intraspecific competition. These results indicate that resource diversity can alleviate intraspecific competition and affect niche diversification, which may impact diversity maintenance in ecological communities.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2024.1240802,0
457,Effect of Intracellular Carbon Resource on Competition between PAOs and GAOs for Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal,"Batch tests were conducted to study the effect of internal carbon resource on the competition between phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs) and glycogen accumulating organism (GAOs) for simultaneous N and P removal. The result showed that the average P removal rate of PAOs was above 98.5%. Both PAOs and GAOs enriched sludge released P effectively on the anaerobic phase, and about 20 mg/L P was released. In the anoxic-P uptake process, 2.24 mmol/g-MLVSS and 2.44 mmol/g-MLVSS of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) were consumed by PAOs enriched sludge and GAOs enriched sludge, respectively. Simultaneously, the glycogen concentration of GAOs enriched sludge was higher than that of PAOs enriched sludge during the anoxic process, on the contrast, more glycogen was synthesized in PAOs enriched sludge than GAOs enriched sludge, and 0.95 mmol/g-MLVSS glycogen was synthesized in PAOs enriched sludge.",https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.1073-1076.1007,0
458,"Search patterns, resource regeneration, and ambush locations impact the competition between active and ambush predators","Abstract Many predators ambush prey rather than pursue them or shift between foraging modes. Active predators typically encounter prey more frequently than ambush predators. I designed a simulation model to examine whether this always holds and how active and ambush predators fare in capturing mobile prey. Prey foraged for clumped resources using area‐restricted search, shifting from directional movement before resource encounter to less directional movement afterward. While active predators succeeded more than ambush predators, the advantage of active predators diminished when ambush predators were positioned inside resource patches rather than outside. I investigated the impact of eight treatments and their interactions. For example, regeneration of prey resources increased the difference between ambush predators inside and outside patches, and uncertain prey capture by predators decreased this difference. Several interactions resulted in outcomes different from each factor in isolation. For instance, reducing the directionality level of active predators impacted moderately when applied alone, but when combined with resource regeneration it led to the worst success of active predators against ambush predators inside patches. Ambush predators may not always be inferior to active predators, and one should consider the key traits of the studied system to predict the relative success of these two foraging modes.",https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.15169,0

460,Ecological resource competition as a driver of metallome evolution,"Abstract Undoubtedly, Earth’s first redox revolution, which culminated ∼2.4 billion years ago in the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), fundamentally altered the resources available to microbial communities, leading to novel ecological competitions and evolutionary innovations. These eco-evolutionary dynamics are largely unexplored, particularly at the molecular level. Here, we hypothesize that such dynamics in the wake of the GOE explain the otherwise paradoxical evolutionary history of metal use in nitrogen fixation by nitrogenase. This ancient metalloenzyme exists in three isozymes, with distinct metal cofactors. Recent research demonstrates that the most ancient isozyme, emerging a billion years or more before the GOE, required a molybdenum (Mo)-based cofactor. “Alternative” nitrogenases using iron (Fe) or vanadium (V) cofactors evolved after the GOE. This history is puzzling because Mo availability in the environment increased after the GOE, while Fe availability decreased , due to the contrasting environmental redox behaviors of these elements. Why, then, did the alternatives emerge only after the GOE? Using a simple model constrained by known microbial Mo quotas, we demonstrate that a strong selection pressure for use of metals in nitrogenase other than Mo is a likely consequence of competition between nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes and nitrate-reducing microbes, which require Mo for nitrate reduction and assimilation. This competition would have intensified after the GOE due to increasing environmental availability of nitrate, explaining the evolutionary timing of the nitrogenase isozymes. Ecological resource competition therefore emerges as a third driver of metallome evolution in deep-time, alongside the relative environmental availabilities and adaptive advantages of particular metals. Significance statement The selection of metals in biochemical evolution is widely attributed to either the relative environmental availability of specific metals or their functional benefits in biological systems. We propose a third pressure, ecological resource competition, which is typically overlooked as a driver of molecular novelty in deep time. Specifically, we hypothesize that competition between Mo-dependent nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes and Mo-dependent nitrate reducers led to the emergence of Mo-free “alternative” nitrogenase enzymes during the early Proterozoic. This novel hypothesis explains the paradoxical emergence of alternative nitrogenases after the Great Oxidation Event despite increasing ocean Mo abundances at that time. Competition among microbial species for the same metals likely drove molecular innovations, especially in response to dynamically changing geochemical landscapes.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.11.627971,0
461,Fending for oneself or partnering up: Competition between mixo- and heterotrophic ciliates under dynamic resource supply,"Abstract The outcome of species competition strongly depends on the traits of the competitors and associated trade-offs, as well as on environmental variability. Here we investigate the relevance of consumer trait variation for species coexistence in a ciliate consumer – microalgal prey system under fluctuating regimes of resource supply. We focus on consumer competition and feeding traits, and specifically on the consumer’s ability to overcome periods of resource limitation by mixotrophy, i.e. the ability of photosynthetic carbon fixation via algal symbionts in addition to phagotrophy. In a 48-day chemostat experiment, we investigated competitive interactions of different heterotrophic and mixotrophic ciliates of the genera Euplotes and Coleps under different resource regimes, providing prey either continuously or in pulses under constant or fluctuating light, entailing periods of resource depletion in fluctuating environments, but overall providing the same amount of prey and light. Although ultimate competition results remained unaffected, population dynamics of mixotrophic and heterotrophic ciliates were significantly altered by resource supply mode. However, the effects differed among species combinations and changed over time. Whether mixotrophs or heterotrophs dominated in competition strongly depended on the genera of the competing species and thus species-specific differences in the minimum resource requirements that are associated with feeding on shared prey, nutrient uptake, light harvesting and access to additional resources such as bacteria. Potential differences in the curvature of the species’ resource-dependent growth functions may have further mediated the species-specific responses to the different resource supply modes. In addition, while the presence of a heterotrophic competitor may have a direct negative effect on the growth rate of a mixotrophic species through grazing on a shared prey species, its presence may also have an indirect positive effect on the growth rate of the mixotroph by reducing competition between the autotroph and mixotroph for shared nutrients and light. Our study thus demonstrates that complex trophic interactions determine the outcome of competition, which can only be understood by taking on a multidimensional trait perspective.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.06.564392,0
462,A resource competition model for seed mass variation in grasslands,"The large variation in seed mass among species inspired a vast array of theoretical and empirical research that attempt to explain this variation. So far, seed mass variation was explained by two classes of models, the first focused on coexistence of species varying in seed mass within communities, while the second focused on variation in seed mass between communities along environmental gradients. Here, we develop a mechanistic resource competition model capable of simultaneously explaining variation in seed mass within and between communities. We use the model to investigate how differences in seed mass among species interact with light asymmetry and growth allometry to determine the relative fitness (relative reproductive success) of large- vs. small-seeded species within communities, and how such interactions are translated into patterns of seed mass variation along gradients of resource availability and disturbance. Under the framework of the model, growth allometry increases the relative fitness of small seeded species while light asymmetry increases the relative fitness of large seeded species. Increasing resource availability increases the fitness of large-seeded species by increasing the relative importance of light competition. In contrast, disturbance increases the fitness of small seeded species due to a combination of different mechanisms operating simultaneously. Resource availability and disturbance also influence the magnitude of within-community differences in fitness (and therefore, the potential for species coexistence). The observed patterns are consistent with empirically observed responses of species diversity to resource availability, disturbance and their interaction (e.g. the unimodal diversity response to resource availability and the 'grazing reversal hypothesis').",,0
463,A statistical approach to assess interspecific consumptive competition and functional redundancy in ephemeral resource uses using camera traps,"Camera traps have been widely used in wildlife research, offering significant potential for monitoring species interactions at ephemeral resources. However, raw data obtained from camera traps often face limitations due to observation censoring, where resource consumption by dominant animals may obscure potential resource use by less dominant animals. We extended time-to-detection occupancy modeling to quantify interspecific consumptive competition and redundancy of ecosystem functions through consumption between two species, while accounting for observation censoring. By treating resource use by rival species as censored data, we estimated the proportion of resources potentially used in the absence of rival species and calculated the loss caused by the rival species, which is defined as ""Competition Intensity Index."" We also defined the Unique Functional Contribution, which represents the net functional loss when a species is removed, calculated by excluding the contribution potentially substituted by the other species. We also considered resource degradation and computed the quantity of resources acquired by each species. This established framework was applied to predation data on bird nests by alien squirrels and other predators (Case 1) as well as scavenging on mammalian carcasses by two carnivores (Case 2). In Case 1, the introduction of squirrels significantly affected the breeding success of birds. Although nests were being preyed upon by native crows also, our model estimated that Unique Functional Contribution by the squirrels was 0.47. This means that, by eradicating the squirrels, the reproductive success of the birds could potentially increase by as much as 47%. In Case 2, the Competition Intensity Index for foxes was 0.17, whereas that for raccoon dogs was 0.46, suggesting an asymmetric effect of resource competition between the two species. The frequency distribution of wet mass available to the two species differed significantly. This approach will enable a more robust construction of resource-consumer interaction networks.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.70031,0
464,"Resource competition, not facilitation, structures gravel beach plant communities","Abstract Questions How are plant–plant interactions mediated by environmental factors to influence plant community structure on gravel beaches? Location Two coastal gravel beaches on the eastern coast of New Zealand. Methods We surveyed plant co‐occurrence patterns on the beaches and performed plant addition experiments, varying nutrients, water, and presence of potential nurse plants. We used C‐score analysis to test whether observed individual and species co‐occurrence patterns deviated from random expectation. Generalised linear modelling of survival within the experiments tested the importance of potential nurse plants vs both resource‐ and non‐resource‐based stress. Results Despite the harsh conditions, species co‐occurred less frequently than expected if distributions were random. The presence of adult nurse plants had a negative, rather than facilitative effect on growth and survival of planted shrub seedlings. Abiotic factors also influenced seedling survival, although responses were species‐specific. Conclusions We found no evidence that facilitation plays a role in structuring plant communities in the highly stressed environment of New Zealand gravel beaches. Rather, our results support the prediction that resource competition is the dominant factor in determining community structure in highly stressed environments and is inconsistent with the stress gradient hypothesis.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.13099,0
465,Kleptoparasitism and Coexistence: Resource Competition Between Indian Leopards and Striped Hyenas,"In ecosystems where multiple carnivores coexist, interspecific interactions are crucial in shaping behavioral adaptations and resource utilization strategies. This study examines the competitive dynamics between Indian leopards (Panthera pardus fusca) and striped hyenas (Hyaena hyaena) in the Jhalana Reserve Forest, an urban-enclosed wildlife habitat in Jaipur, India. Using direct observations, citizen science contributions, and camera-trap data, we document kleptoparasitism and competitive exclusion instances where hyenas successfully outnumber leopards to gain access to food. Our findings indicate that hyenas exhibit an acute ability to locate leopard kills, often arriving within minutes of a leopard beginning to feed. Additionally, spatial constraints imposed by the reserve’s fencing create an ecological imbalance, as leopards can access external food sources while hyenas remain confined. We also discuss the potential consequences of supplementary feeding practices, which may influence predator behavior and interspecific interactions. This study highlights the importance of understanding competitive dynamics in fragmented landscapes to inform conservation strategies that promote coexistence.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ani15060784,0
466,Test of Resource Competition Theory Between Microalga and Macroalga Under Phosphate Limitation,"Short_term batch cultures were used to measure the phosphate_dependent growth kinetics for a marine microalga, Tetraselmis subcordiformis (Wille) Hazen, and a marine macroalga, Ulva pertusa Kjellm. Results were fitted to the Monod model. U. pertusa had a lower half_saturation constant and maximum growth rate, which were 0.016 μmol/L and 0.16 d -1 respectively, while the growth kinetics of T. subcordiformis were 0.021 μmol/L and 0.83 d -1 . Long_term semicontinuous nutrient competition experiments were performed between T. subcordiformis and U. pertusa under phosphate limitation in laboratory. Loss rates were manipulated to get the same or different resource requirement values ( R * ) of the two species. Comparison between the theoretical predictions derived from Monod kinetics and the outcome of competition experiments indicated that the Monod model could predict the results only when the R * values of the two species were significantly different, and T. subcordiformis displaced U. pertusa when they had the same resource requirements. The Monod model can only partly predict the competition results between microalga and macroalga.",,0
467,Resource competition drives an invasion-replacement event among shrew species on an island,"Abstract Invasive mammals are responsible for the majority of native species extinctions on islands. While most of these extinction events will be due to novel interactions between species (e.g. exotic predators and naive prey), it is more unusual to find incidences where a newly invasive species causes the decline/extinction of a native species on an island when they normally coexist elsewhere in their overlapping mainland ranges. We investigated if resource competition between two insectivorous small mammals was playing a significant role in the rapid replacement of the native pygmy shrew ( Sorex minutus ) in the presence of the recently invading greater white-toothed shrew ( Crocidura russula ) on the island of Ireland. We used DNA metabarcoding of gut contents from &gt;300 individuals of both species to determine each species’ diet and measured the size of individuals (weight and length) during different stages of the invasion in Ireland (before, during and after the species come into contact with one another) and on a French island where both species have long coexisted (acting as a natural ‘control’ site). Dietary composition, niche width and overlap and size were compared in these different stages. The size of the invasive C. russula and composition of its diet changes between when it first invades an area and after it becomes established. Individuals are larger and they consume larger invertebrates at the invasion front, before switching towards the smaller prey taxa that are more essential for the survival of the native species after establishment. As a result, the level of interspecific dietary overlap increases from between 11–14% when they first come into contact with each other to between 39–46% after the invasion. Here we show that an invasive species can quickly alter its dietary niche in a new environment, leading to negative impacts that were not previously predicted based on the coexistence of these species in other parts of their mainland ranges. As well as causing the replacement of a native small mammal, the invasive shrew may be rapidly exhausting local resources of larger invertebrate species. These subsequent changes in terrestrial invertebrate communities could have severe impacts further downstream on ecosystem functioning and services.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.27.489660,0
468,Emergence of diversity-stability-productivity relationships in a generic multi-species resource competition framework,"The relationships between diversity, stability and productivity have been the subject of intense debate in the ecological literature for at least the last half century. The contemporary focus on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has emphasised the role of diversity in controlling the productivity and stability of communities e.g. species assembly experiments and related theoretical studies have shown a positive correlation between diversity and both productivity and stability. On the other hand earlier work emphasised the impact of factors such as productivity and disturbance on diversity. For example, the hump-backed model asserts that diversity is highest at intermediate levels of productivity whilst the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) holds that local diversity is promoted by low levels of disturbance but reduced at high levels. More recently there has been (renewed) recognition that all three factors are interdependent and are determined by the local co-evolution of species assemblages in different settings. Here we present a generic model of resource competition and co-adaptation between species in a local community in which species compete for a single resource and a fluctuating environmental variable determines the relative competitive ranking of species. Coexistence of species is therefore possible via temporal resource partitioning, but in the model this is mediated by the competing effects of stochastic extinction and the immigration of novel phenotypes from a regional species pool. The model is simulated in environments with varying levels of autocorrelation/variability, but with the resource supply rate held constant. Aggregating these simulations builds a picture of diversity-stability-productivity relationships that might be observed in a region with a given level of resource supply, but local variation in the properties of the environmental variable. These relationships broadly agree with the IDH and hump-backed models. In contrast when we vary resource levels (indicative of regional/large-scale gradients) we typically find increasing diversity-stability, diversity-productivity relationships. Finally, by turning off the immigration component, the model is used to study species assembly scenarios with results confirming the positive impact of diversity on stability and productivity. Our results suggest that many of the documented relationships between diversity, productivity and stability can be viewed as different facets of a fundamental competition for resources.",,0
469,Responses of rhizosphere microbial communities and resource competition to soil amendment in saline and alkaline soils,"<title>Abstract</title> Background and aims Soil amendments have been widely applied in the remediation of saline soil and the improvement of crops resistance to external stresses. However, the responses of soil microbial community composition, structure, function, and resource competition strategy to soil amendment in saline and alkaline soil remain unclear. Methods A barrel experiment was performed in a cotton field to explore the effects of soil amendment on soil microbial life history strategies under simulated saline and alkali stresses during cotton flowering stage. Results The results showed that saline and alkali stresses disrupted soil microbial succession and altered rhizosphere soil micro-environment. However, after the application of amendment in saline soil, the abundance of dominant bacteria (<italic>Subgroup_17</italic>) and fungi (<italic>Mortierella</italic>, <italic>Chaetomium</italic>), soil metabolic functions (biosynthesis of amino acids and fatty acid), soil K<sup>+</sup> content and Si/N ratio significantly increased, while soil Na<sup>+</sup> content and electrical conductivity (EC) significantly reduced. After the application of amendment in alkaline soil, the abundance of dominant soil bacteria (<italic>Aeromicronium</italic>, <italic>Rokubacteriales</italic>, <italic>RB41</italic>) and fungi (<italic>Mycosphaeralla</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus</italic>), phenylalanine metabolise and fatty acid biosynthesis pathways soil K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio, organic carbon content, total nitrogen, and Si/N ratio significantly increased, while soil Na<sup>+</sup> content, pH, and Si/C ratio significantly decreased.

470,"Niche filtering, not interspecific resource competition, explains the co-occurrence of butterfly species across the Japanese archipelago","The relevance of interspecific resource competition in the context of community assembly by herbivorous insects is a well-known topic in ecology. Most previous studies focused on local species assemblies, that shared host plants. Few studies evaluated species pairs within a single taxon when investigating the effects of host plant sharing at the regional scale. Herein, we explore the effect of plant sharing on the geographical co-occurrence patterns of 229 butterflies distributed across the Japanese archipelago; we use two spatial scales (10 × 10 km and 1 × 1 km grids) to this end. We considered that we might encounter one of two predictable patterns in terms of the relationship between co-occurrence and host-sharing among butterflies. On the one hand, host-sharing might promote distributional exclusivity attributable to interspecific resource competition. On the other hand, sharing of host plants might promote co-occurrence attributable to filtering by resource niche. At both grid scales, we found significant negative correlations between host use similarity and distributional exclusivity. Our results support the thesis that the butterfly co-occurrence pattern across the Japanese archipelago is better explained by filtering via resource niche rather than interspecific resource competition.",,0
471,Low Water Depth and Fluctuation Facilitated Weak-Competitive Floating-Leaved Plants by Altering Light Resource Competition,"Floating-leaved plants are aquatic plants living between the shore and the open water, with their petioles holding leaves floating on the water surface and roots entrenching in the sediment. Hydrological conditions affect the growth and interspecific interaction of aquatic plants. Brasenia schreberi J. F. Gmel. and Nymphoides peltate (Gmel.) O. Kuntze occupied similar ecological niches. While the former is classified as a second-class endangered species in China, the latter is known for its strong invasive potential. We conducted an experiments in which plants were cultivated in mixed or monoculture under four hydrological conditions (20, 50, 80 cm and fluctuation). The coverage, biomass, petiole length, branch length, and number of remates were measured. Our results indicate that N. peltate exhibited increased development when grown in mixed culture, while B. schreberi showed a marked decline except under low water levels and fluctuating conditions. The relative interaction index (RII) was highest under low water levels and followed by fluctuating conditions. Our results suggest that B. schreberi shows weak competitive ability when grown with N. peltate, but performs better in low water levels and fluctuating conditions. Specifically, in low water levels, B. schreberi is able to compete for light resources before N. peltate dominates the water surface.Additionally, in fluctuating conditions, N. peltate dominance is constantly disrupted, which enable weaker competitors to survive and ultimately contributing to the maintenance of species diversity.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4404604,0

473,"The political ecology of small-scale gold mining reform in Guyana : resource competition, formal institutions, and green development pathways","This thesis operationalizes a political ecology research programme to examine the different dimensions of environmentally-oriented small-scale gold mining reform within Guyana’s unique mining setting. The study is based on a year of fieldwork in Guyana and employs a mix of spatial, quantitative, and qualitative data – including multiple Geographic Information Systems (GIS) maps, mineral property data, hundreds of secondary documents, three ethnographic site-based case studies, and 143 semi-structured interviews._x000D_
_x000D_
The research approach examines the small-scale reform agenda in Guyana as a ‘storyline’, enabling a view of the policy agenda as not only embodying structures and institutions, but as also predicated on particular assumptions about social and ecological reality. By highlighting the contrasts between the ways policies are perceived and experienced by a range of actors on the ground with the abstract policy framings, it offers an analysis of the root causes of policy failure, conflict, and economic and social injustice._x000D_
_x000D_
The thesis identifies a range of powerful (and under-acknowledged) political phenomena in the mining landscape that threaten the legibility, legitimacy, and effectiveness of the reform approach. These phenomena relate to contested local understandings of environmental change; unresolved contentions among poorer miners and indigenous groups over the structural basis of formal titles; emerging forms of market-mediated exclusion; and inherent ‘informality’ amidst intense resource competition, state fragility and remote geographies._x000D_
_x000D_
The persistence of such phenomena offers a reminder that mining reform is not merely a ‘legal-institutional’ process but an inherently ‘political’ one that entails contestation over how social and ecological relationships are defined and managed. While showing how a political ecology approach enables engagement with a range of normative concerns, this thesis also makes specific contributions to current academic and policy debates on small-scale gold mining governance, offering new insights on patterns of informality, injustice, and exclusion.",,0
474,EFFECTS OF REDUCED INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION ON RESOURCE UTILIZATION IN,"The effects of a reduction in the size of a roach (Rutilus rutilus) population on a perch (Percafluviatilis) population were studied. The population size of roach was reduced by 70% and the biomass by 40%. The biomass of the perch population increased by 140%, which was a result of an increase in young-of-the-year (0+) perch. The consumption of the adult perch population increased more than two-fold compared to the situation before the removal experiment. 0+ perch did not switch in August from a diet of zooplankton to a diet of macroinvertebrates, as was the case before the removal experiment, and they also expanded their habitat. This resulted in a reduced age class com- petition, and the limitations set by the macroinvertebrate bottleneck phase in the life period of perch were reduced. Though the removal experiment lacked a control, the considerable response of both the zooplankton community and the perch population strongly suggests that roach greatly influenced the resource intake and resource utilization of perch.",,0

476,EFFECTS OF SPERM COMPETITION ON RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN MALE DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,"Evolution and sexual selection have favoured the development of morphological, physiological and behavioural adaptations in males to handle sperm competition risk. Some males however, are also able to respond to this risk within a much shorter time period. Their plastic phenotype allows them to adapt according to their ever-changing environment. There are, however, costs and limitations to plasticity and there is a trade-off between reproduction and survival. In addition, the investment into plastic sperm-competitive traits creates supplementary energy costs. The aim of this project was to study the trade-off between survival and male Drosophila melanogaster responses to sperm competition, and to look at the effect these responses have on both fitness and resource allocation. In a first experiment, the interactions between various nutrient treatments, sperm competition, and survival of virgin males were studied. It was found that males were only able to invest and benefit from sperm-competitive traits with a sufficient energy supply. Male survival was optimum at intermediate nutrient level and, when conditioned to sperm competition, they lived longer and were less active than males not conditioned to sperm competition. In a second set of experiments, using three nutrient levels and sperm competition risk, male survival and reproductive success were measured. It was found that males subjected to low nutrient treatment increased their mating duration and invested more in courtship, which suggests that terminal investment was taking place. This study has added evidence to the terminal investment concept, and has contributed to the research on the energy trade-off between reproduction, socio-sexuality and the individuals’ experience of their environment.",,0
477,"Resource Use of Native Bees: Understanding Roles of Preference, Nutrition and Competition","Author(s): Harmon-Threatt, Alexandra Nicole | Advisor(s): Kremen, Claire | Abstract: Global declines of pollinators have highlighted the lack of information on pollinator species and communities necessary to improve conservation efforts. Specifically, significant information is missing on resource use of native pollinators and factors at both the species and community level that influence resource selection. My dissertation work uses a variety of methods to examine resource use and patterns at the species level and community level for native bumble bees (Bombus) and how preference, nutrition and competition affect foraging and community assembly. Identifying resource and habitat preference is considered a key component to conserving declining species and is commonly used by conservation biologists for birds and mammals. Although identifying resource preference is also considered critical to conserving pollinators, to date no comparable work has been done on pollinator species. In chapter one, pollen use of the yellow faced bumble bee (Bombus vosnesensekii) was conducted using a Dirichlet multinomial model (DM) by comparing three different models of collection: 1) Use=Availability, 2)Use=Preference* Availability and 3) Use. Although B.vosnesenskii was thought to be a generalist forager, it does not collect pollen with respect to its availability and demonstrated significant preferences for some resources when accounting for availability. Additionally, models that excluded availability were typically superior to those that included availability. This suggests that estimates of preference and resource reliance can be adequately estimated without measuring availability which may be critical for cryptic species and those difficult to identify available resources such as pollinators. To better understand the patterns of resource preference found in chapter one, analysis of features that may influence resource use was conducted. Morphological, nutritional (protein and amino acid composition) and availability (pollen per inflorescence) features of plants were measured for 12 species available to B. vosnesenskii. Plants were divided first by origin (native or non-native) and then by collection (collected or not-collected) and compared across groups. Although it is assumed native species should be superior for native pollinators no significant differences were found when compared based on origin. However, when grouped based on collection, collected species were significantly different for amino acid content, protein, and availability. This suggests that not all native plants are adequate resources to support pollinator communities and that not all invasive species are inadequate and that care should be taken when restoring plant communities for pollinators. Lastly, phylogenetic methods were used to understand patterns of community assembly and competition in bumble bee communities. Community assembly theory would suggest that communities should attempt to limit similarity, either morphological or phylogenetic similarity, to maintain coexistence. Bumble bees have long been considered to limit overlap in a community by dividing niche space by tongue length and thus communities were thought to be comprised of species with different tongue lengths. To test this, the Nearest Taxon Index (NTI) and Net Relatedness Index (NRI) were calculated for 118 co-occurring communities in Nearctic Areas of North America using a phylogenetic distance matrix and a trait distance matrix. Although, long believed to limit similarity by having different tongue lengths this method found bumble bee communities were both phylogentically closely related and had more similar tongue length when compared to randomly generated null communities. This could suggest that patterns of community assembly and resource use may be driven by nutritional requirements of bumble bees and require them to share resources rather than divide the niche space as expected. Although further work is needed to support these findings, the patterns found here have implications for conservation of native pollinators. The observed non-random patterns of resource use, both for preference and floral traits, suggest that significant effort should be made to determine plant species that support native pollinators particularly species that are declining. It is commonly assumed that by restoring native plant communities native bee communities will return but this work highlights that not all native plants can provide necessary protein or amino acids to support bee communities. Lastly, the high level of relatedness of bumble bee communities may suggest that whole communities may respond similarly to threats such as disease or habitat fragmentation and thus may be more susceptible to whole community losses. Efforts should be made to monitor populations and limit damage to communities. While all species have intrinsic value, pollinators are also invaluable to maintaining wild flower and crop plants that support higher trophic level diversity and food security and thus particular efforts should be made to conserve them.",,0
478,The structure of Congolese shrew ensembles: competition and spatial variation in resource abundance,"Abstract Interspecific competition, environmental filtering, or spatial variation in productivity can contribute to positive or negative spatial covariance in the abundances of species across ensembles (i.e., groups of interacting species defined by geography, resource use, and taxonomy). In contrast, density compensation should give rise to a negative relationship between ecomorphological similarity and abundance of species within ensembles. We evaluated (1) whether positive or negative covariances characterized the pairwise relationships of 21 species of Congolese shrew, and (2) whether density compensation characterized the structure of each of 36 Congolese shrew ensembles, and did so based on the abundances or biomasses of species. In general, positive covariance is more common than negative covariance based on considerations of abundance or biomass, suggesting dominant roles for environmental filtering and productivity. Nonetheless, negative covariance is more common for ecomorphologically similar species, suggesting a dominant role for competition within functional groups. Effects of abundance or biomass compensation, via pairwise or diffuse competitive interactions, were detected less often than expected by chance, suggesting that interspecific competition is not the dominant mechanism structuring these ensembles. Effects of competition may be balanced by responses to variation in resource abundance among sites in a landscape or among niche spaces within sites. Future studies of compensatory effects should incorporate considerations of heterogeneity in the abundance and distribution of resources in ecological space to better isolate the effects of competition and resource abundance, which can have opposing effects on community structure.",https://doi.org/10.1093/jmammal/gyae032,0
479,Moisture and competition constrain ephemeral resource quality for burying beetle reproduction,"Abstract Shifts in abiotic factors such as temperature and moisture can change the availability of resources, especially under climate change. Both abiotic and biotic drivers can have profound, rapid effects on species distribution, survival, and reproduction. Little is known about how abiotic factors affect the availability of ephemeral resources. Burying beetles ( Nicrophorus spp.) are specialist users of ephemeral resources, as their reproduction requires locating, defending, and burying a small carcass. Environmental moisture, such as coastal fog, could change how quickly carcasses dry out. We tested the role of carcass moisture and interspecific competition with a generalist scavenger, Heterosilpha spp., on reproduction by placing pairs of Nicrophorus guttula in field chambers with fresh and experimentally dehydrated mouse carcasses. Pairs that were given fresh mouse carcasses were more likely to carry out reproductive behaviors and produce viable offspring than pairs that were given a partially dehydrated mouse. For those pairs that reproduced, competition limited the number of offspring. These results indicate that shifts in abiotic factors under climate change, along with biotic factors like competition, can reduce the availability of ephemeral resource patches for consumers.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.04.621899,0
480,Inter-Cluster Competition and Resource Partitioning May Govern the Ecology of Frankia,"Abstract Microbes live in a complex communal ecosystem. The structural complexity of microbial community reflects diversity, functionality as well as habitat type. Delineation of ecologically important microbial populations along with exploration of their roles in environmental adaptation or host-microbe interaction has a crucial role in modern microbiology. In this scenario, reverse ecology (the use of genomics to study ecology) plays a pivotal role. Some studies have reported the presence of other non- Frankia genus from the same root nodule from where the Frankia was isolated. Since co-existance of two different genus in one small niche should maintain a strict direct interaction, it will be interesting to utilize the concept of reverse ecology in this scenario.Here, we exploited an ‘R’ package, the RevEcoR, to resolve the issue of co-existing microbes which are proven to be a crucial tool for identifying the nature of their relationship (competition or complementation) persisting among them. Our target organism here is Frankia , a nitrogen-fixing actinobacterium popular for its genetic and host specificity nature. According to their plant host, Frankia has already been subdivided into four clusters CI, CII, CIII and CIV. Our results revealed a strong competing nature of CI Frankia . The competition index between CI and CIII was greater than other studied Frankia clusters. The other interesting result was the co-occurrence of C-II and C-IV groups. It was revealed that these two groups follow the theory of resource partitioning in their lifestyle. Metabolic analysis along with their differential transporter machinery validated our hypothesis of resource partitioning among C-II and C-IV group.",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1183956/v1,0
481,Numerical simulation of competition mechanism calculation under limited resource conditions,"Population space is formed by a regional competition pattern in which nutrients and various cells interact. The competitive relationships of research groups are very important for biodiversity. To solve this problem, a regional nutrient competition model is established and analyzed here, where all cells are subject to biophysical constraints in metabolic trade-offs. By establishing a model, the relationship between its spatial structure, metabolic balance, and cell diversity was clarified. Studies have found that the diffusion time of nutrients is a time scale of cell diversity. The rapid diffusion of nutrients causes fluctuations in certain cell communities, even leading to death and extinction. In addition, competition for space resources can spontaneously generate multiple stabilities. Therefore, small disturbances may cause significant ecological fluctuations. The results show that in a spatial community, only when various cells continuously compete for resources can the microecosystem in the body have a high degree of cell diversity and rich dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1109/icftic59930.2023.10455828,0
482,"Resource availability, competitor abundance and specialization affect competition among bumblebees","Abstract The strength of interspecific and intraspecific competition depends on resource availability, competitor abundance, and specialization. Most studies are conducted with single species pairs, constraining our understanding of what drives competition in multispecies communities. We investigated the effect of floral density, competitor abundance, flowering period, and trait specialization (proboscis length) on the potential for interspecific and intraspecific competition between seven common bumblebee species in the Hengduan Mountains of southwest China. We estimated the potential for interspecific and intraspecific competition using resource partitioning indices in plant-bumblebee networks (Müller’s index) over five consecutive years, quantifying changes in floral densities and bumblebee abundance throughout the season. The potential for interspecific competition increased with bumblebee abundance, particularly when floral density was low later in the season. On the other hand, the potential for intraspecific competition increased with abundance of focal bumblebee species and for specialized long-tongued bumblebees, especially when floral density was low. This suggests that resource scarcity regulates species coexistence by limiting abundant species dominance via interspecific competition and intraspecific competition. Our results indicate the importance of intraspecific competition and specialization in maintaining diversity in multispecies communities.",https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/araf038,0

485,"Carnivory in the Oligo-Miocene: Resource Specialization, Competition, and Coexistence Among North American Fossil Canids","Author(s): Balisi, Mairin Francesca Aragones | Advisor(s): Van Valkenburgh, Blaire | Abstract: Competition likely shaped the evolution of the mammalian family Canidae (dogs and their ancestors; order Carnivora). From their origin 40 million years ago (Ma), early canids lived alongside potential competitors that may have monopolized the large-carnivore niche—such as bears, bear-dogs, and nimravid saber-toothed cats—before becoming large and hypercarnivorous (diet of g70% meat) later in their history. This ecomorphological context, along with high phylogenetic resolution and an outstanding fossil record, makes North American fossil canids an ideal system for investigating how biotic interactions (e.g. competition) and ecological specialization (e.g. hypercarnivory) might influence clade evolution.Chapter 1 investigates whether ecological generalization enables species to have longer durations and broader geographic range. I developed and applied a carnivory index to 100+ species, processing 3708 occurrences through a new duration-estimation method accounting for varying fossil preservation. A non-linear relationship between duration and carnivory emerged: both hyper- and hypocarnivores have shorter durations than mesocarnivores.Chapter 2 tests the cost of hypercarnivory, quantified as elevated extinction risk. Large hypercarnivorous canids experienced extinction rates on par with other canids. However, in each canid subfamily, extinction rates rose after the first occurrence of large hypercarnivores, supporting the idea of hypercarnivory as a “macroevolutionary ratchet” for individual clades. Large hypercarnivores originated just over 10 Ma after the origin of Canidae, exhibiting constant diversification rates and peaking in richness around 12 Ma. Relationships emerge between diversification rates of canid subfamilies and temperature, suggesting future hypotheses to be investigated.Chapter 3 quantifies functional morphology in 114 fossil canids and non-canid competitors from 40 to 15 Ma, testing for ecological congruence between continental and regional scales and whether ecomorphological disparity reflects taxonomic diversity. Disparity appears inversely related to diversity. All four geographic regions examined preserved a narrower range of ecomorphology than at the continental scale. These results suggest that partitioning dietary as well as geographic resources, despite constraints to size, permitted canids to minimize competition and diversify.These macroecological and macroevolutionary studies of early canids and their potential competitors improve understanding of the resilience of the carnivore niche over long timescales, including periods of accelerated global change.",,0

487,Seed mass diversity along resource gradients: the role of allometric growth rate and size-asymmetric competition,"The large variation in seed mass among species inspired a vast array of theoretical and empirical research attempting to explain this variation. So far, seed mass variation was investigated by two classes of studies: one class focuses on species varying in seed mass within communities, while the second focuses on variation between communities, most often with respect to resource gradients. Here, we develop a model capable of simultaneously explaining variation in seed mass within and between communities. The model describes resource competition (for both soil and light resources) in annual communities and incorporates two fundamental aspects: light asymmetry (higher light acquisition per unit biomass for larger individuals) and growth allometry (negative dependency of relative growth rate on plant biomass). Results show that both factors are critical in determining patterns of seed mass variation. In general, growth allometry increases the reproductive success of small-seeded species while light asymmetry increases the reproductive success of large-seeded species. Increasing availability of soil resources increases light competition, thereby increasing the reproductive success of large-seeded species and ultimately the community (weighted) mean seed mass. An unexpected prediction of the model is that maximum variation in community seed mass (a measure of functional diversity) occurs under intermediate levels of soil resources. Extensions of the model incorporating size-dependent seed survival and disturbance also show patterns consistent with empirical observations. These overall results suggest that the mechanisms captured by the model are important in determining patterns of species and functional diversity.",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1709.09391,0

489,"Stoichiometrically Explicit Competition between Grazers: Species Replacement, Coexistence, and Priority Effects along Resource Supply Gradients","Assuming key trade‐offs among interactors, several models (resource ratio, keystone predation, intraguild predation) predict changes in species composition over resource supply gradients. Ecological stoichiometry could also predict compositional shifts of grazers over gradients of nutrient and light supply through a mechanism involving (mis)matches between elemental body composition of grazers and plants. This hypothesis is explored here using a suite of two‐grazer, one‐plant models that incorporate three key components: plant production depends on light and nutrients, nutrient content of plants can vary, and homeostatic grazers can be carbon or nutrient limited. The results from this suite closely resemble the classical resource ratio model describing plant competition for two resources. Here, the models predict shifts of grazer composition along resource supply gradients if species trade off competitive abilities for plant carbon and nutrients. Given this trade‐off, superior nutrient competitors should dominate low nutrient environments, and superior carbon competitors should dominate high nutrient environments. At intermediate nutrient supply, species can coexist at a stable equilibrium, or alternative stable states emerge, depending on how grazers impact their resources. These results depend on food web architecture, however. For instance, predators can alter or reduce possibilities for stoichiometry‐mediated coexistence of grazers.",https://doi.org/10.2307/3473436,0

491,Regulation of Keystone Predation by Small Changes in Ocean Temperature,"Key species interactions that are sensitive to temperature may act as leverage points through which small changes in climate could generate large changes in natural communities. Field and laboratory experiments showed that a slight decrease in water temperature dramatically reduced the effects of a keystone predator, the sea star Pisaster ochraceus , on its principal prey. Ongoing changes in patterns of cold water upwelling, associated with El Niño events and longer term geophysical changes, may thus have far-reaching impacts on the composition and diversity of these rocky intertidal communities.",https://doi.org/10.1126/science.283.5410.2095,0
492,Keystone Predation and Interaction Strength: Interactive Effects of Predators on Their Main Prey,"The application of basic ecological concepts to fields of conservation biology and applied environmental sciences is a healthy sign, but before these concepts are widely used, ecology must provide operational definitions and quantifiable methods. Keystone species and interaction strength are concepts with deep practical and theoretical implications. We studied the strength of predation on mussels (Mytilus trossulus) by the keystone seastar Pisaster ochraceus and the whelks Nucella emarginata and N. canaliculata under different environmental conditions in the Oregon intertidal zone. We attempted to determine: (1) the sensitivity of keystone predation to the presence of other predators in the system; (2) the role of other predators in the presence and absence of a keystone species; and (3) the per capita and population—level variability in interaction strengths of strong (keystone) vs. weak interactors. Predation intensity on mussels was measured by recording the survival of mussels transplanted to areas from which seastars, whelks, or both, had been either manually removed or left undisturbed at natural densities. Whelk experimental units were nested within those for the seastar treatment to account for the much larger body size and greater mobility of seastars. Each combination of seastar and whelk treatment was replicated four times in both wave—exposed and wave—protected habitats of two sites that differed in predator densities, primary productivity, and recruitment and growth rates of prey species. Predation intensity by the keystone predator was strong under all site $\times$ wave exposure combinations, and was unaffected by the presence of whelks. Whelks, in contrast, had ecologically important effects on mussel survival in the absence, but not in the presence, of the keystone predator. Population (total) interaction strength between seastars and mussels was 2—10 times stronger than that between whelks and mussels across sites and wave exposures. Per capita interaction strength of seastars was two to three orders of magnitude larger than that of whelks. However, per capita effects of seastars were more variable between sites and wave exposures, probably because simple density values grossly underestimate the ability of mobile predators to localize prey. Such interactive effects and variability in interaction strengths between keystone and weak predators may characterize all keystone predator—dominated systems, but data currently are insufficient to test this proposition. Negative effects of seastars on whelk density were observed &lt;4 mo following initiation of Pisaster removals. Seastars also had a negative effect on whelk sizes, which took longer to appear, after 6 mo of continuous Pisaster removal. Negative effects of seastars on whelks appeared to be stronger in places with higher densities of predators, partially explaining the reduced predation intensity of whelks observed in the presence of seastars. Our results support the idea that in keystone—dominated systems, species other than the keystone species have only minor, if any, effects on the rest of the community, and thus might be cited by some as r edundant species. However, our results also indicate that, after the loss of a keystone species, previously r edundant species can partially compensate for the reduced predation and adopt a major role in the altered system. Such responses are potentially an important force in stabilizing communities. Further, such possible compensatory capabilities of alternative consumers suggests that, at least for predators, the term r edundant species conveys an inaccurate image of the potential importance of weak interactors and should be abandoned.",https://doi.org/10.2307/2963488,0
493,Spatial dynamics of keystone predation,"1. I investigated the effects of dispersal on communities of keystone predators and prey. I obtained two key results. 2. First, a strong trade-off between competitive ability and predator susceptibility allows consumer coexistence over a large resource productivity range, but it also lowers the predator-susceptible superior competitor's abundance and increases its risk of extinction. Thus, unexpectedly, dispersal plays a more important role in coexistence when predator-mediated coexistence is strong rather than weak. The interplay between the trade-off, small population sizes resulting from transient oscillations, and dispersal leads to qualitatively different species distributions depending on the relative mobilities of the consumers and predator. These differences yield comparative predictions that can be tested with data on trade-off strength, dispersal rates, and species distributions across productivity gradients. 3. Second, there is an asymmetry between species in their dispersal effects: the predator-resistant inferior competitor's dispersal has a large effect, but the predator-susceptible superior competitor's dispersal has no effect, on coexistence and species' distributions. The inferior competitor's dispersal also mediates the predator's dispersal effects: the predator's dispersal has no effect when the inferior competitor is immobile, and a large effect when it is mobile. The net outcome of the direct and indirect effects of the inferior competitor's dispersal is a qualitative change in the species' distributions from interspecific segregation to interspecific aggregation. 4. The important point is that differences between species in how they balance resource acquisition and predator avoidance can lead to unexpected differences in their dispersal effects. While consumer coexistence in the absence of dispersal is driven largely by the top predator, consumer coexistence in the presence of dispersal is driven largely by the predator-resistant inferior competitor.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01439.x,0
494,Keystone predation and molecules of keystone significance,"Keystone species structure ecological communities and are major determinants of biodiversity. A synthesis of research on keystone species is nonetheless missing a critical component - the sensory mechanisms for behavioral interactions that determine population- and community-wide attributes. Here, we establish the chemosensory basis for keystone predation by sea stars (Pisaster ochraceus) on mussels. This consumer-resource interaction is prototypic of top-down driven trophic cascades. Each mussel species (Mytilus californianus and M. galloprovincialis) secretes a glycoprotein orthologue (29.6 and 28.1 kDa, respectively) that acts, singularly, to evoke the sea star predatory response. The orthologues (named ""KEYSTONEin"") are localized in the epidermis, extrapallial fluid, and organic shell coating (periostracum) of live, intact mussels. Thus, KEYSTONEin contacts chemosensory receptors on tube feet as sea stars crawl over rocky surfaces in search of prey. The complete nucleotide sequences reveal that KEYSTONEin shares 87% (M. californianus) or 98% (M. galloprovincialis) homology with a calcium-binding protein in the shell matrix of a closely related congener, M. edulis. All three molecules cluster tightly within the Complement Component 1 Domain Containing (C1qDC) protein family; each exhibits a large globular domain, low complexity region(s), coiled coil, and at least four of five histidine-aspartic acid tandem motifs. Collective results support the hypothesis that KEYSTONEin evolved ancestrally in immunological, and later, in biomineralization roles. More recently, the substance has become exploited by sea stars as a contact cue for prey recognition. As the first identified compound to evoke keystone predation, KEYSTONEin provides valuable sensory information, promotes biodiversity, and shapes community structure and function. Without this molecule, there would be no predation by sea stars on mussels.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.1849,0
495,Keystone Predation and Plant Species Coexistence: The Role of Carnivore Hunting Mode,"Plant communities are shaped by bottom-up processes such as competition for nutrients and top-down processes such as herbivory. Although much theoretical work has studied how herbivores can mediate plant species coexistence, indirect effects caused by the carnivores that consume herbivores have been largely ignored. These carnivores can have significant indirect effects on plants by altering herbivore density (density-mediated effects) and behavior (trait-mediated effects). Carnivores that differ in traits, particularly in their hunting mode, cause different indirect effects on plants and, ultimately, different plant community compositions. We analyze a food-web model to determine how plant coexistence is affected by herbivore-consuming carnivores, contrasting those causing only density-mediated effects with those causing trait-mediated effects as well. In the latter case, herbivores can adjust their consumption of a refuge plant species. We derive a general graphical model to study the interplay of density- and trait-mediated effects. We show that carnivores eliciting both effects can sustain plant species coexistence, given intermediate intensities of behavioral adjustments. Coexistence is more likely, and more stable, if the refuge plant is competitively dominant. These results extend our understanding of carnivore indirect effects in food webs and show that behavioral effects can have major consequences on plant community structure, stressing the need for theoretical approaches that incorporate dynamical traits.",https://doi.org/10.1086/657436,0
496,"Sea Star Wasting Disease in the Keystone Predator Pisaster ochraceus in Oregon: Insights into Differential Population Impacts, Recovery, Predation Rate, and Temperature Effects from Long-Term Research","Sea star wasting disease (SSWD) first appeared in Oregon in April 2014, and by June had spread to most of the coast. Although delayed compared to areas to the north and south, SSWD was initially most intense in north and central Oregon and spread southward. Up to 90% of individuals showed signs of disease from June-August 2014. In rocky intertidal habitats, populations of the dominant sea star Pisaster ochraceus were rapidly depleted, with magnitudes of decline in density among sites ranging from -2x to -9x (59 to 84%) and of biomass from -2.6x to -15.8x (60 to 90%) by September 2014. The frequency of symptomatic individuals declined over winter and persisted at a low rate through the spring and summer 2015 (~5–15%, at most sites) and into fall 2015. Disease expression included six symptoms: initially with twisting arms, then deflation and/or lesions, lost arms, losing grip on substrate, and final disintegration. SSWD was disproportionally higher in orange individuals, and higher in tidepools. Although historically P. ochraceus recruitment has been low, from fall 2014 to spring 2015 an unprecedented surge of sea star recruitment occurred at all sites, ranging from ~7x to 300x greater than in 2014. The loss of adult and juvenile individuals in 2014 led to a dramatic decline in predation rate on mussels compared to the previous two decades. A proximate cause of wasting was likely the ""Sea Star associated Densovirus"" (SSaDV), but the ultimate factors triggering the epidemic, if any, remain unclear. Although warm temperature has been proposed as a possible trigger, SSWD in Oregon populations increased with cool temperatures. Since P. ochraceus is a keystone predator that can strongly influence the biodiversity and community structure of the intertidal community, major community-level responses to the disease are expected. However, predicting the specific impacts and time course of change across west coast meta-communities is difficult, suggesting the need for detailed coast-wide investigation of the effects of this outbreak.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0153994,0
497,"Selection, predation and dispersal of seeds by tree squirrels in temperate and boreal forests: are tree squirrels keystone granivores?","This paper summarizes the ecological and evolutionary interactions for seed trees and Holarctic tree squirrels. The squirrel-seed interactions prior to dispersal and hoarding of seeds as well as those in which squirrels exert a significant positive effect on dispersal and establishment of seeds are reviewed. Across all Holarctic systems, three primary selective pressures that tree squirrels exert on tree seeds are recognized: two as seed predator and one as seed disperser. The close evolutionary relationship between several species of tree squirrels and tree species on which they feed, including the influence of tree squirrels on seed and tree characteristics and the effects of seeds on the demography, behaviour and social system of the squirrels are considered. It is suggested that in some systems tree squirrels might be considered keystone consumers as a result of their disproportionate influence on seed fates.",https://doi.org/10.1079/9780851998060.0205,0
498,Evaluating the effects of trophic complexity on a keystone predator by disassembling a partial intraguild predation food web,"Summary 1. Many taxa can be found in food webs that differ in trophic complexity, but it is unclear how trophic complexity affects the performance of particular taxa. In pond food webs, larvae of the salamander Ambystoma opacum occupy the intermediate predator trophic position in a partial intraguild predation (IGP) food web and can function as keystone predators. Larval A. opacum are also found in simpler food webs lacking either top predators or shared prey. 2. We conducted an experiment where a partial IGP food web was simplified, and we measured the growth and survival of larval A. opacum in each set of food webs. Partial IGP food webs that had either a low abundance or high abundance of total prey were also simplified by independently removing top predators and/or shared prey. 3. Removing top predators always increased A. opacum survival, but removal of shared prey had no effect on A. opacum survival, regardless of total prey abundance. 4. Surprisingly, food web simplification had no effect on the growth of A. opacum when present in food webs with a low abundance of prey but had important effects on A. opacum growth in food webs with a high abundance of prey. Simplifying a partial IGP food web with a high abundance of prey reduced A. opacum growth when either top predators or shared prey were removed from the food web and the loss of top predators and shared prey influenced A. opacum growth in a non‐additive fashion. 5. The non‐additive response in A. opacum growth appears to be the result of supplemental prey availability augmenting the beneficial effects of top predators. Top predators had a beneficial effect on A. opacum populations by reducing the abundance of A. opacum present and thereby reducing the intensity of intraspecific competition. 6. Our study indicates that the effects of food web simplification on the performance of A. opacum are complex and depend on both how a partial IGP food web is simplified and how abundant prey are in the food web. These findings are important because they demonstrate how trophic complexity can create variation in the performance of intermediate predators that play important roles in temporary pond food webs.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01906.x,0
499,Temperature effects on metabolic scaling of a keystone freshwater crustacean depend on fish-predation regime,"According to the metabolic theory of ecology, metabolic rate, an important indicator of the pace of life, varies with body mass and temperature due to internal physical constraints. However, various ecological factors may also affect metabolic rate and its scaling with body mass. Although reports of such effects on metabolic scaling usually focus on single factors, the possibility of significant interactive effects between multiple factors requires further study. In this study, we show that the effect of temperature on the ontogenetic scaling of resting metabolic rate of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus minus depends critically on habitat differences in predation regime. Increasing temperature tends to cause decreases in the metabolic scaling exponent (slope) in population samples from springs with fish predators, but increases in population samples from springs without fish. Accordingly, the temperature sensitivity of metabolic rate is not only size-specific, but also its relationship to body size shifts dramatically in response to fish predators. We hypothesize that the dampened effect of temperature on the metabolic rate of large adults in springs with fish, and of small juveniles in springs without fish are adaptive evolutionary responses to differences in the relative mortality risk of adults and juveniles in springs with versus without fish predators. Our results demonstrate a complex interaction among metabolic rate, body size, temperature, and predation regime. The intraspecific scaling of metabolic rate with body size and temperature is not merely the result of physical constraints related to internal body design and biochemical kinetics, but rather is ecologically sensitive and evolutionarily malleable.",https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.232322,0
500,"Keystone and Intraguild Predation, Intraspecific Density Dependence, and a Guild of Coexisting Consumers","Previous models of diamond-shaped and intraguild predation community modules have represented the essence of the trade-off necessary for a top predator to prevent competitive exclusion among a set of resource-limited consumers. However, at most two consumers can coexist in these models. In this article, I show how intraspecific density dependence in the consumers can permit many more than two consumers to coexist in these community modules. Moreover, responses of the community to removal of the top predator depend on the patterns of the strengths of species interactions relative to the strengths of intraspecific density dependence. If the consumers experience similar strengths of intraspecific density dependence, removing the top predator will in most cases have little effect on consumer species richness. A substantial reduction in consumer species richness with predator removal (i.e., the keystone predation effect) will typically occur only when the consumer that can support a population at the lowest resource abundance also (1) experiences substantially weaker intraspecific density dependence than other consumers and (2) experiences significantly higher levels of mortality from the predator. These results identify how intraspecific density dependence fosters the coexistence of multiple consumers in two important community modules and shapes the responses of these community modules to perturbations such as predator removal.",https://doi.org/10.1086/674010,0
501,Summer predation rates on ungulate prey by a large keystone predator: how many ungulates does a large predator kill?,"Abstract Estimates of predation rates by large predators can provide valuable information on their potential impact on their ungulate prey populations. This is especially the case for pumas Puma concolor and its main prey, mule deer Odocoileus hemionus . However, only limited information on predation rates of pumas exist where mule deer are the only ungulate prey available. I used VHF telemetry data collected over 24‐h monitoring sessions and once daily over consecutive days to derive two independent estimates of puma predation rates on mule deer where they were the only large prey available. For the 24‐h data, I had 48 time blocks on female pumas with kittens, 43 blocks on females without kittens and 30 blocks on males. For the daily consecutive data, the average number of consecutive days followed was 51.5±4.2 days. There were data on five female pumas with kittens, five pregnant females and nine females without kittens. Predation rates over an average month of 30 days from the 24‐h monitoring sessions were 2.0 mule deer per puma month for males (15.1 days per kill), 2.1 mule deer per puma month (14.3 days per kill) for females without kittens and 2.5 mule deer per puma month (12.0 days per kill) for pregnant females and females with kittens. For the consecutive daily data, females without kittens had an estimated predation rate of 2.1±0.14 mule deer per puma month (14.9±0.90 days per kill). Pregnant and females with kittens had predation rates of 2.7±0.18 and 2.6±0.21 mule deer per puma month, respectively (11.4±0.72 and 12.0±1.1 days per kill, respectively). Predation rates estimated in this study compared with those estimated by energetic demand for pumas in the study area but were lower than other field derived estimates. These data help increase our understanding of predation impacts of large predators on their prey.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2008.00443.x,0
502,Implications of Habitat Loss on Seed Predation and Early Recruitment of a Keystone Palm in Anthropogenic Landscapes in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest,"Habitat loss is the main driver of the loss of global biodiversity. Knowledge on this subject, however, is highly concentrated on species richness and composition patterns, with little discussion on the consequences of habitat loss for ecological interactions. Therefore, a systemic approach is necessary to maximize the success of conservation efforts by providing more realistic information about the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on natural environmental processes. We investigated the implications of habitat loss for the early recruitment of Euterpe edulis Martius, a keystone palm in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, in nine sampling sites located in landscapes with different percentages of forest cover (9%-83%). We conducted a paired experiment using E. Edulis seeds set up in experimental stations composed of a vertebrate exclosure versus an open treatment. We used ANCOVA models with treatments as factors to assess the influence of habitat loss on the number of germinated seeds, predation by vertebrates and invertebrates, infestation by fungi, and number of seedlings established. Habitat loss did not affect the probability of transition from a dispersed to a germinated seed. However, when seeds were protected from vertebrate removal, seedling recruitment showed a positive relationship with the amount of forest cover. Seed infestation by fungi was not significant, and seed predation was the main factor limiting seed recruitment. The loss of forest cover antagonistically affected the patterns of seed predation by vertebrates and invertebrates; predation by invertebrates was higher in less forested areas, and predation by vertebrates was higher in forested areas. When seeds were exposed to the action of all biotic mortality factors, the number of recruited seedlings was very low and unrelated to habitat loss. This result indicates that the opposite effects of seed predation by vertebrates and invertebrates mask a differential response of E. edulis recruitment to habitat loss.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0133540,0
503,Comfort over safety: thermoregulation overshadows predation risk effects in the activity of a keystone prey,"Abstract The activity level is a fundamental metric of animal behavior, related to the avoidance of predators, food acquisition, and thermoregulation. Animals need to weigh their activity budget to fulfill their energetic, social and reproductive requirements over the energetic costs of these activities. This task becomes further challenging for prey species, which also need to account for predation risk. To investigate the factors shaping proactive behavioral decisions leading prey species engagement in their diel activities, we implemented a multisite year‐round monitoring study on the Iberian rabbit ( Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus ), a key prey species in Mediterranean ecosystems. We deployed remotely triggered cameras over 15 sites to continuously monitor Iberian rabbits' activity. We estimated activity levels from time‐of‐detection data from camera traps, and modeled it as a function of climatic, intraspecific, predation, and resource‐related covariates. We found that Iberian rabbits exhibit a bimodal activity pattern peaking at sunrise and sunset, with a more pronounced peak occurring at sunrise during the nonbreeding season, and spend 9.15 ± 3.00 h/day (mean ± sd ) active. Diel activity levels were negatively affected by extreme environmental temperatures and density dependence, demonstrating the privileged importance of social interactions and normothermia maintenance. We found mammalian predator activity and abundance to have near‐negligible effects on the activity levels of this key prey, suggesting decreased antipredator behavior when risk is perceived as prolonged. Moreover, we argue that perceived risk may be more important than realized risk in shaping Iberian rabbits' activity level. These results provide valuable insights toward a comprehensive understanding of the factors underlying behavioral decisions made by prey species, relevant for maintaining their energetic and homeostatic balance.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jzo.12947,0
504,Can crabs kill like a keystone predator? A field-test of the effects of crab predation on mussel mortality on a northeast Pacific rocky shore,"Predation can strongly influence community structure and ecosystem function, so the loss of key predators can have dramatic ecological consequences, unless other predatory species in the system are capable of playing similar ecological roles. In light of the recent outbreak of sea star wasting disease (SSWD) and subsequent depletion of west coast sea star populations, including those of the keystone predator Pisaster ochraceus, we examined whether large mobile crabs could play a role as predators on mussels (Mytilus californianus) on a rocky shore in Northern California. Using a combination of sea star removal and predator exclusion cages we found that mussel mortality was 43-294 times greater in uncaged treatments versus caged treatments. Mortality on uncaged mussels at low tidal elevations was due to predation by large mobile crabs (Cancer productus and Romaleon antennarium); confirmed by the presence of mussel shell fragments and documented attacks on wax snail replicas. Laboratory feeding assays indicated that crabs, on a per unit biomass basis, can consume almost twenty-five times as many mussels per day than sea stars, which together with the results of our field experiment, suggest that large predatory crabs could play an important role in maintaining ecosystem function through their predation on mussels on rocky shores where P. ochraceus are rare, absent, or have been depleted by SSWD.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183064,0
505,Predation cues amplify the effects of parasites on the personality of a keystone grazer,"Parasites can alter species interactions either by modifying infected host behaviour or by influencing behavioural responses in uninfected individuals. Salt marsh ecosystems are characterized by a predator-prey interaction between the keystone grazer, Littoraria irrorata, and its main predator, Callinectes sapidus, both integral players in mediating the productivity of these habitats. Littoraria also acts as the first intermediate host for at least four species of digenetic trematode. Parasite infection has been shown to decrease grazing and climbing in populations of Littoraria, although effects on infected host response to predators have not been investigated. Moreover, how infection might increase or decrease among-individual variation in behaviour (i.e. animal personality) is still unknown. Here we ask how trematode infection affects the expression of boldness in the anti-predator responses of L. irrorata in both the absence and presence of a predator cue. We find that individual boldness varies substantially, and repeatability tends to increase as the number of stressors increases, with infected individuals exposed to a predator cue showing the strongest expression of behavioural types. Parasitism amplifies this effect, although the parasite itself does not appear to directly induce behavioural changes: infected snails show no evidence of decreased climbing or differences in refuge use as compared to their uninfected counterparts. Infection might therefore drive the expression of condition-dependent personality differences evident only under high-risk conditions. Group infection status strongly influenced behavioural reaction norms: uninfected individuals grouped with an infected snail were more responsive to predation risk, exhibiting increased climbing behaviour and spending less time in the water. Here parasites are influencing personality indirectly by inducing avoidance behaviours in healthy individuals, although only in high-risk environments. The potential for exposure to parasites and predators fluctuates greatly across marsh ecosystems. Given the ecological importance of this predator-prey relationship, trematode infection can act as an important, although indirect, determinant of overall salt marsh community structure, health and function.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13891,0
506,Adaptation in a keystone grazer under novel predation pressure,"Understanding how species adapt to environmental change is necessary to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services. Growing evidence suggests species can adapt rapidly to novel selection pressures like predation from invasive species, but the repeatability and predictability of selection remain poorly understood in wild populations. We tested how a keystone aquatic herbivore, Daphnia pulicaria, evolved in response to predation pressure by the introduced zooplanktivore Bythotrephes longimanus. Using high-resolution 210Pb-dated sediment cores from 12 lakes in Ontario (Canada), which primarily differed in invasion status by Bythotrephes, we compared Daphnia population genetic structure over time using whole-genome sequencing of individual resting embryos. We found strong genetic differentiation between populations approximately 70 years before versus 30 years after reported Bythotrephes invasion, with no difference over this period in uninvaded lakes. Compared with uninvaded lakes, we identified, on average, 64 times more loci were putatively under selection in the invaded lakes. Differentiated loci were mainly associated with known reproductive and stress responses, and mean body size consistently increased by 14.1% over time in invaded lakes. These results suggest Daphnia populations were repeatedly acquiring heritable genetic adaptations to escape gape-limited predation. More generally, our results suggest some aspects of environmental change predictably shape genome evolution.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2024.1935,0
507,Influencing factors of predation on five keystone prey species in Haizhou Bay based on Delta-GAMMs.,"Trophic dynamics is one of the major regulators of fishery production in marine ecosystems, which is important for the implementation of ecosystem-based fisheries management. Based on data collected form bottom trawl surveys in Haizhou Bay and adjacent waters during autumn of 2011 and 2018, Delta-GAMMs (Delta-generalized additive mixed models) were constructed to evaluate the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on the predation of five key prey species (including Leptochela gracilis, Alpheus japonicus, Loligo spp., Larimichthys polyactis, and Oratosquilla oratoria) in the Haizhou Bay. Percent frequency of occurrence and predation pressure index were used to identify their major predators. Variance inflation factor and full subsets regression were analyzed to quantify the degree of multicollinearity between these factors. The results showed that the occurrence frequency of keystone prey species in the stomach of predators ranged from 8.5% to 42.2%, and the weight percentage ranged from 4.2% to 40.9%. The average deviance explanation rate of the ""binomial"" model was 16.1%, and the average deviance explanation rate of the ""positive"" model was 23.8%. Body length of predator, predator population density, and sea bottom temperature were important factors influencing prey-predator trophic interactions. Predator length was the most important factor, with feeding probability and weight percentage of keystone prey species all increasing with body length of predator. Feeding probability and weight percentage of key prey species decreased with predator population density. The effects of environmental factors such as sea bottom temperature, depth of water, latitude, and sea bottom salinity showed different trends, depending on the prey-predator assemblage. This study showed that the Delta-GAMMs was an effective method to explore the trophic interactions between prey and predators in marine ecosystems, and could provide a theoretical basis for the conservation and sustainable use of fisheries resources.海洋生态系统的营养动力学是决定渔业生产力的主要因素,也是实施基于生态系统的渔业管理的重要基础。为了评估生物因子和非生物因子对海州湾5种关键饵料生物被摄食的影响,本研究基于2011和2018年秋季在海州湾及其邻近海域进行的渔业资源底拖网调查和胃含物分析数据,构建了Delta-GAMMs模型,选择细螯虾、日本鼓虾、枪乌贼、小黄鱼和口虾蛄5种关键饵料生物作为研究对象,基于出现频率百分比和捕食压力指数筛选其主要捕食者,基于方差膨胀因子和全子集回归筛选影响5种关键饵料生物被摄食的关键因子。结果表明: 5种关键饵料生物在捕食者食物中的出现频率范围为8.5%～42.2%,重量百分比范围为4.2%～40.9%。Delta-GAMMs二项模型和正态模型的平均偏差解释率分别为16.1%和23.8%。捕食者体长、捕食者种群密度和底层水温是影响饵料生物-捕食者相互作用的重要因素。其中,捕食者体长是最重要的影响因素,关键饵料生物的被摄食率和被摄食量均随捕食者体长的增加呈上升趋势,关键饵料生物的被摄食率和被摄食量随着捕食者种群密度的增加而下降。此外,底层水温、水深、纬度和底层盐度等环境因素对种间营养关系的影响,因饵料生物-捕食者组合的不同而呈现不同的趋势。研究表明,Delta-GAMMs模型是探究海洋生态系统饵料生物与捕食者相互作用的有效方法,能够为渔业资源养护和可持续利用提供理论依据。.",https://doi.org/10.13287/j.1001-9332.202304.030,0
508,A Theoretical Framework for Intraguild Predation,"Many important issues in community ecology revolve around the interplay of competition and predation. Species that compete may also be locked in predator-prey interactions, a mixture of competition and predation known as ""intraguild predation"" (IGP). There is growing evidence for the importance of IGP in many natural communities, yet little formal ecological theory addresses this particular blend of interactions. In this article, we explore the consequences of incorporating IGP into standard models of exploitative competition and food chains (a general resource-consumer model, a Lotka-Volterra food chain model, and Schoener's exploitative competition model). Our theoretical analyses suggest a general criterion for coexistence in IGP systems: the intermediate species (the prey in intraguild predation) should be superior at exploitative competition for the shared resource, whereas the top species (the predator) should gain significantly from its consumption of the intermediate species. Along gradients in environmental productivity, coexistence is most likely at intermediate levels of productivity. Analyses of the models reveal the potential for alternative stable states in systems with IGP; these are particularly likely if the top predator gains little benefit from consuming the intermediate predator. We further show that IGP can lead to unstable population dynamics, even when all pairwise interactions are inherently stable and each species can increase when rare. Persistent, strong IGP raises a puzzle of species coexistence, particularly in productive environments. We conclude by comparing IGP with related community modules (i.e., food chains, exploitative competition, apparent competition) and discussing mechanisms that should foster coexistence in systems with strong IGP.",https://doi.org/10.1086/286018,0
509,Intraguild predation: a widespread interaction related to species biology,"Abstract Intraguild predation (IGP), defined as killing and eating among potential competitors, seems to be a ubiquitous interaction, differing from competition or predation. In the present study we assess the frequency of IGP among 763 potential intraguild prey and 599 potential intraguild predators. Our results indicate that IGP is common in nature, reaching frequencies between 58.4 and 86.7%. A null model suggests that IGP in different groups of predators and prey (i.e. carnivores, omnivores, herbivores, detritivores, or top and intermediate species) have different deviations from a chance expectation, indicating these attributes of species biology as main determinants of IGP persistence. We suggest that IGP satisfies two basic requirements to be considered as important to the trophic structuring of communities. First, its occurrence is not random, rather it is associated with well‐defined attributes of species biology, and secondly, it is a widespread interaction.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00613.x,0
510,HABITAT STRUCTURE AFFECTS INTRAGUILD PREDATION,"Intraguild predation is thought to be ubiquitous in natural food webs. Yet, theory on intraguild predation predicts the intraguild prey to persist only under limited conditions. This gap between theory and empirical observations needs scrutiny. One reason might be that theory has focused on equilibrium dynamics and a limited set of species (usually three) that interact in well-mixed populations in unstructured habitats, and these assumptions will often not hold in natural systems. In this review, we focus on the effects of habitat structure on intraguild predation. Habitat structure could reduce encounter rates between predators and prey and could create refuges for prey. In both cases, habitat structure could reduce the strength of intraguild interactions, thereby facilitating species coexistence. A meta-analysis of studies on manipulation of habitat structure shows that intraguild prey indeed suffer less from intraguild predation in structured habitats. This was further confirmed by a meta-analysis in which studies on intraguild predation were classified according to habitat structure. Intraguild predation reduced densities of the intraguild prey significantly more in habitats with little structure than in habitats rich in structure. The effect of intraguild predation on the shared prey was negative, and not significantly affected by habitat structure. We conclude that habitat structure may increase persistence of the intraguild prey by decreasing the strength of the interaction between intraguild predator and intraguild prey.",https://doi.org/10.1890/06-1408.1,0
511,INTRAGUILD PREDATION DIMINISHED IN COMPLEX-STRUCTURED VEGETATION: IMPLICATIONS FOR PREY SUPPRESSION,"Multiple-predator limitation of prey populations may be mediated by both predator–predator interactions and vegetation structure. Antagonistic interactions among predators, such as intraguild predation, can diminish the collective impact of natural enemies on prey population size. However, structurally complex vegetation may moderate such interactions by providing a refuge for predators, thereby enhancing prey suppression. Specifically, we examined the combined impact of two salt-marsh-inhabiting invertebrate predators, the mirid Tytthus vagus and the wolf spider Pardosa littoralis, on suppression of their shared prey, the planthopper Prokelisia dolus, in simple (thatch-free) and complex (thatch-rich) vegetation. In structurally simple habitats in the laboratory, the predators interacted antagonistically, due to the intraguild predation of mirids by spiders, and predation pressure on the planthopper population was relaxed. However, structurally complex habitats dampened this antagonistic interaction by providing a refuge for mirids from spider predation, thereby increasing the combined effectiveness of these predators in suppressing planthopper populations. Consistent with our laboratory results, we found enhanced co-occurrence of these predators in complex habitats in the field, where mirids are apparently at lower risk from spider predation and outbreaks of planthoppers are less likely. In contrast, in simple habitats, mirids were relatively less abundant, a finding consistent with the expectation of increased intraguild predation from spiders. Therefore, in this salt marsh system, complex vegetation diminished the occurrence of intraguild predation between mirids and spiders and increased overall enemy impact on their shared herbivore prey, demonstrating for the first time that plants can mediate enemy effects on insect herbivores by influencing predator–predator interactions.",https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[0643:ipdics]2.0.co;2,0
512,Predator diversity and the functioning of ecosystems: the role of intraguild predation in dampening trophic cascades,"Abstract Single trophic‐level studies of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning highlight the importance of mechanisms such as resource partitioning, facilitation, and sampling effect. In a multi‐trophic context, trophic interactions such as intraguild predation may also be an important mediator of this relationship. Using a salt‐marsh food web, we investigated the interactive effects of predator species richness (one to three species) and trophic composition (strict predators, intraguild predators, or a mixture of the two) on ecosystem functions such as prey suppression and primary production via trophic cascades. We found that the trophic composition of the predator assemblage determined the impact of increasing predator species richness on the occurrence of trophic cascades. In addition, increasing the proportion of intraguild predator species present diminished herbivore suppression and reduced primary productivity. Therefore, trophic composition of the predator assemblage can play an important role in determining the nature of the relationship between predator diversity and ecosystem function.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00832.x,0
513,INTRAGUILD PREDATION AMONG APHID PREDATORS: CHARACTERIZATION AND INFLUENCE OF EXTRAGUILD PREY DENSITY,"Intraguild predation (IGP), a common interaction in invertebrates and vertebrates, affects the abundance and distribution of many species. Several parameters influence the magnitude and direction of IGP: feeding specificity, size, mobility, and aggressiveness of the protagonists, as well as extraguild prey density. Under laboratory conditions, we studied IGP among three species of aphid predators, Aphidoletes aphidimyza (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), Chrysoperla rufilabris (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), and Coleomegilla maculata lengi (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), which commonly attack the potato aphid (extraguild prey) Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Homoptera: Aphididae). We characterized the levels and symmetry of IGP among the various stages of the predators in the absence of extraguild prey. The aphid specialist A. aphidimyza was more vulnerable to IGP than C. rufilabris and C. maculata, two generalist predators. The C. maculata/C. rufilabris interaction was symmetric (mutual IGP), whereas the C. maculata/A. aphidimyza and C. rufilabris/A. aphidimyza interactions were asymmetric, in favor of the coccinellid and the lacewing, respectively. Sessile and low mobility stages of all species were extremely vulnerable to IGP. Generally, the larger sized individual won confrontations. For similar sizes, lacewing larvae were superior to coccinellid larvae. We also tested whether IGP decreases when extraguild prey are introduced into the system. Data from five predator combinations revealed three types of responses: (1) an exponential decrease in IGP (lacewing instar I vs. coccinellid instar I); (2) a constant IGP (lacewing instar III vs. coccinellid instar I); (3) a constant IGP at low densities decreasing at high densities (lacewing instar III vs. gall midge old larva). Four theoretical scenarios are derived from these responses. Each is discussed according to the ecological attributes of the protagonists. This study shows that IGP is influenced by factors inherent to the predators and external factors such as extraguild prey density. The results are discussed further in the context of aphid biological control.",https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[1084:ipaapc]2.0.co;2,0
514,Intraguild Predation and Competition Among Desert Scorpions,"Interactions among four species of desert scorpion were analyzed over a 9—yr period at two sites in the Coachella Valley, California. Although potential competitors that feed on similar anthropod prey, these species also eat one another (i.e., engage in intraguild predation); heterospecific scorpions were found to form 8—21.9% of the diet. Size differences determine scorpion—scorpion predation. Larger individuals of any species were always the predator, and prey scorpions were most frequently males and individuals that were in motion. Intraguild predation was most frequent when food availability was low. The numerically dominant scorpion, Paruroctonus mesaensis (&gt;95% of all individuals), killed and ate 8 and 6% of two smaller scorpion species (Paruroctonus luteolus and Vaejovis confusus, respectively) and 10% of all the observed newborn of another scorpion species, Hadrurus arizonensis. Mortality due to P. mesaensis was generally an inverse function of the density of P. luteolus and of V. confusus. During a 29—mo experiment, &gt;6000 P. mesaensis were removed from 300 100—m 2 quadrats. There were significant increases in the populations of P. luteolus and V. confusus (but not of Hadrurus) in the removal quadrats, compared to control quadrats. The hypothesis that species compete exploitatively for food was also tested. Although there was extensive evidence that food limited feeding, growth, adult size, and reproduction, there was no evidence that food use by one scorpion depleted the availability of prey to other scorpions: abundance of prey (determined by trapping), percent feeding (number of individuals observed with prey ° total number of individuals observed), and mean body sizes were not greater in the removal vs. control quadrats. We conclude that intraguild predation rather than exploitation competition is the major factor structuring the observed patterns of distribution and abundance of these scorpions. We suggest that aspects of foraging behavior and the spatial and temporal patterns of surface activity of smaller scorpion species and age classes have coevolved largely to avoid predation by P. mesaensis. Many assemblages of scorpion species exhibit intraguild predation, and we speculate that this process produces behavioral and activity patterns similar to those observed in this study.",https://doi.org/10.2307/1939264,0
515,Intraguild predation among aphidophagous predators,"Since the publication of papers by Polis et al. (1989Polis et al. ( , 1992)), intraguild predation (IGP) has been considered in numerous systems and a growing number of papers have been published, demonstrating the ubiquity and the importance of this interaction.It appears that aphidophagous guilds constitute especially favourable systems for IGP.Temporal and spatial distributions of aphids promote interactions, such as IGP, among natural enemies.However, despite extensive laboratory and field studies, several questions remain to be answered: Which traits of the different protagonists of the system may promote or hamper the occurrence of IGP? How do ants tending aphids modulate the interaction?How should one consider the ""sub-lethal"" effects (and the defensive mechanisms) associated with the risk of IGP? May IGP disrupt or enhance aphid control?These different issues are discussed by focusing on the predatory species in the complex system of aphidophagous guilds.It appears that, first, IGP may constitute one of the main forces influencing the structure and dynamics of aphidophagous guilds, and therefore it has to be taken into account in research studies, and second, because of the ephemeral nature of aphid colonies and the great number of species belonging to aphidophagous guilds, understanding all the implications of the interaction, both direct and indirect, constitutes a very complex task.",https://doi.org/10.14411/eje.2005.052,0
516,Intraguild predation in raptor assemblages: a review,"Intraguild predation, the killing of species that use similar resources, has been largely overlooked in raptor investigations. To help fill this gap in knowledge, we conducted a literature review, focusing on studies that tested the behavioural and demographic impact of intraguild predation on individuals, populations, and assemblages of diurnal and nocturnal raptorial species. Overall, data were available for 39 empirical and experimental studies on 63 populations belonging to 11 killer species and 15 victim species. An overview of these studies suggested that intraguild predation was a widespread, size‐based phenomenon. Results from multiple studies on the same species at different locations were usually consistent across wide geographical areas. Individual‐level demographic impacts included reduced site‐occupancy, breeding success and survival. Individuals of the prey species responded to predation pressure through direct spatial avoidance, risk‐sensitive habitat selection, short‐term behavioural avoidance (e.g. reduced vocal activity and escape to refugia after predator detection) and, possibly, temporal segregation. Population‐level effects were common but mainly examined as spatio‐temporal correlations between the abundance of killer and victim species. Correlative evidence also suggested that intraguild predation may have the potential to structure whole raptor assemblages. More studies on other species and different geographic areas are needed to increase our understanding of the causes and consequences of this widespread interaction. From a conservation point of view, intraguild predation may limit the success of raptor preservation programmes and could be used as a management tool through its effect on mesopredator release and its potentially positive, indirect effects on game species.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919x.2008.00786.x,0
517,Intraguild Predation and Competition Between Larval Dragonflies: Direct and Indirect Effects on Shared Prey,"We conducted manipulative field experiments in artificial ponds to quantify the predatory impact of larvae of a migratory dragonfly (Tramea lacerata) on a common resident dragonfly species (Erythemis simplicicollis), and on damselflies as shared prey of the two dragonflies. We found that the combined predatory effects of these two dragonflies on damselflies were not additive. To determine the underlying cause of non—additive predation rates in the field, we conducted a second experiment in laboratory aquaria to isolate the impact of each predator on the consumption rates of the other. Dragonfly consumption rates of damselflies in single—predator treatments were compared to those in the presence of heterospecifics or conspecifics with their menta (mouthparts) surgically modified so that they could not capture prey. In the laboratory experiment, de—mented Tramea reduced the consumption rates of Erythemis to less than half of that observed when Erythemis foraged alone. Erythemis numbers were also reduced by Tramea predation. Erythemis had neither effect on Tramea. Both of the negative effects of Tramea on Erythemis will have indirect positive effects on damselflies. The ""behavioral"" component (reduced Erythemis foraging rate) should be more important than the ""trophic link"" (reduced Erythemis numbers) indirect effect. Together these indirect positive effects will allay, but not completely compensate for, the direct negative effects of Tramea predation on damselflies. These results illustrate how an asymmetric potential for intraguild predation can lead to asymmetries in interference competition and to non—additive effects on prey mortality. The addition of removal of predators that interact in this manner to or from communities should have only a small net effect on prey because of compensating direct and indirect effects. This may explain why predator manipulations have often had unpredictable or undetectable effects on freshwater benthic communities.",https://doi.org/10.2307/1939515,0
518,Trophic supplements to intraguild predation,"Intraguild predation (IGP) is a dominant community module in terrestrial food webs that occurs when multiple consumers feed both on each other and on a shared prey. This specific form of omnivory is common in terrestrial communities and is of particular interest for conservation biology and biological control given its potential to disrupt management of threatened or pest species. Extensive theory exists to describe the dynamics of three‐species IGP, but these models have largely overlooked the potential for other, exterior interactions, to alter the dynamics within the IGP module. We investigated how three forms of feeding outside of the IGP module by intraguild predators (i.e. trophic supplementation) affect the dynamics of the predators (both IG predator and IG prey) and their shared resource. Specifically, we examined how the provision of a constant donor‐controlled resource, the availability of an alternative prey species, and predator plant‐feeding affect the dynamics of IGP models. All three forms of trophic supplements modified the basic expectations of IGP theory in two important ways, and their effects were similar. First, coexistence was possible without the IG prey being a superior competitor for the original shared resource if the IG prey could effectively exploit one of the types of trophic supplements. However, supplements to the IG predator restricted the potential for coexistence. Second, supplements to the IG prey ameliorated the disruptive effects of the IG predator on the suppression of the shared resource, promoting effective control of the resource in the presence of both predators. Consideration of these three forms of trophic supplementation, all well documented in natural communities, adds substantial realism and predictive power to intraguild predation theory.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2007.15378.x,0
519,"PRODUCTIVITY, INTRAGUILD PREDATION, AND POPULATION DYNAMICS IN EXPERIMENTAL FOOD WEBS","Theory predicts that productivity and the relative efficiency of resource utilization determine the outcome of interactions between intraguild predators and prey. Interactions between two freshwater protists, Colpidium striatum (the intraguild prey) and Blepharisma americanum (the intraguild predator), in laboratory microcosms support the predictions of intraguild predation theory. Colpidium competitively excluded Blepharisma when bacterial production was low, even though Blepharisma had a potential advantage conferred by its ability to consume Colpidium. In contrast to competitive exclusion at low productivity, Colpidium and Blepharisma coexisted for many generations at higher levels of bacterial production. Theory predicts a similar transition from competitive exclusion to coexistence as productivity increases, if intraguild predators use resources less efficiently than intraguild prey/competitors. Other experiments showed that Colpidium depresses bacterial densities more than Blepharisma, a result consistent with greater efficiency of resource utilization by Colpidium. These results indicate that simple mathematical models can provide important insights into the population dynamics of intraguild predators and prey under different levels of productivity.",https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[0752:pipapd]2.0.co;2,0
520,The Ubiquity of Intraguild Predation among Predatory Arthropods,"Intraguild predation (IGP) occurs when one predator species attacks another predator species with which it competes for a shared prey species. Despite the apparent omnipresence of intraguild interactions in natural and managed ecosystems, very few studies have quantified rates of IGP in various taxa under field conditions. We used molecular analyses of gut contents to assess the nature and incidence of IGP among four species of coccinellid predators in soybean fields. Over half of the 368 predator individuals collected in soybean contained the DNA of other coccinellid species indicating that IGP was very common at our field site. Furthermore, 13.2% of the sampled individuals contained two and even three other coccinellid species in their gut. The interaction was reciprocal, as each of the four coccinellid species has the capacity to feed on the others. To our knowledge, this study represents the most convincing field evidence of a high prevalence of IGP among predatory arthropods. The finding has important implications for conservation biology and biological control.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0028061,0
521,FOOD WEBS AND INTRAGUILD PREDATION: COMMUNITY INTERACTIONS OF A NATIVE MESOCARNIVORE,"Trophic level interactions between predators create complex relationships such as intraguild predation. Theoretical research has predicted two possible paths to stability in intraguild systems: intermediate predators either outcompete higher-order predators for shared resources or select habitat based on security. The effects of intraguild predation on intermediate mammalian predators such as swift foxes (Vulpes velox) are not well understood. We examined the relationships between swift foxes and both their predators and prey, as well the effect of vegetation structure on swift fox-coyote (Canis latrans) interactions, between August 2001 and August 2004. In a natural experiment created by the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site in southeastern Colorado, USA, we documented swift fox survival and density in a variety of landscapes and compared these parameters in relation to prey availability, coyote abundance, and vegetation structure. Swift fox density varied significantly between study sites, while survival did not. Coyote abundance was positively related to the basal prey species and vegetation structure, while swift fox density was negatively related to coyote abundance, basal prey species, and vegetation structure. Our results support the prediction that, under intraguild predation in terrestrial systems, top predator distribution matches resource availability (resource match), while intermediate predator distribution inversely matches predation risk (safety match). While predation by coyotes may be the specific cause of swift fox mortality in this system, the more general mechanism appears to be exposure to predation moderated by shrub density.",https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2007)88[334:fwaipc]2.0.co;2,0
522,Habitat selection by predators and prey in communities with asymmetrical intraguild predation,"Competition and predation have broad ecological consequences as they may influence individual behavior and community structure. In some cases, they are linked and predator and prey are also competitors (intraguild predation). I present a game theoretic model of habitat use by predators and prey under conditions of asymmetrical intraguild predation. This model predicts that when the diet of intraguild predators is restricted to intraguild prey and the resource for which predators and prey compete (the basal resource), co‐occurrence is only stable when dietary overlap is low and productivity of the basal resource is not high. The addition of alternative resources for predators results in co‐occurrence under all conditions. Variation in alternative resource productivity produces a continuum of intraguild prey distributions from matching relative habitat safety, to one that reflects both food and predation risk. When there is a substantial alternative resource for predators, the distribution of predators matches that of alternative resource availability while the distribution of prey is influenced by both habitat riskiness and food availability. The density and distribution of the predator's alternative resource thus influence habitat selection by the intraguild prey. This stresses the importance of indirect interactions in structuring habitat use in communities and the need to view habitat selection in a community context.",https://doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.920315.x,0
523,Intraguild Predation and Cannibalism among Larvae of Detritivorous Caddisflies in Subalpine Wetlands,"Comparative data from subalpine wetlands in Colorado indicate that larvae of the limnephilid caddisflies, Asynarchus nigriculus and Limnephilus externus, are reciprocally abundant among habitats–Limnephilus larvae dominate in permanent waters, whereas Asynarchus larvae dominate in temporary basins. The purpose of this paper is to report on field and laboratory experiments that link this pattern of abundance to biotic interactions among larvae. In the first field experiment, growth and survival were compared in single and mixed species treatments in littoral enclosures. Larvae, which eat mainly vascular plant detritus, grew at similar rates among treatments in both temporary and permanent habitats suggesting that exploitative competition is not important under natural food levels and caddisfly densities. However, the survival of Limnephilus larvae was reduced in the presence of Asynarchus larvae. Subsequent behavioral studies in laboratory arenas revealed that Asynarchus larvae are extremely aggressive predators on Limnephilus larvae. In a second field experiment we manipulated the relative sizes of larvae and found that Limnephilus larvae were preyed on only when Asynarchus larvae had the same size advantage observed in natural populations. Our data suggest that the dominance of Asynarchus larvae in temporary habitats is due to asymmetric intraguild predation (IGP) facilitated by a phenological head start in development. These data do not explain the dominance of Limnephilus larvae in permanent basins, which we show elsewhere to be an indirect effect of salamander predation. Behavioral observations also revealed that Asynarchus larvae are cannibalistic. In contrast to the IGP on Limnephilus larvae, Asynarchus cannibalism occurs among same—sized larvae and often involves the mobbing of one victim by several conspecifics. In a third field experiment, we found that Asynarchus cannibalism was not density—dependent and occurred even at low larval densities. We hypothesize that Asynarchus IGP and cannibalism provide a dietary supplement to detritus that may be necessary for the timely completion of development in these nutrient—poor, high—elevation wetlands.",https://doi.org/10.2307/2265743,0
524,Intraguild Predation of Beneficial Arthropods by Red Imported Fire Ants in Cotton,"The red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta (Buren), is an invasive species in the southern United States and is expanding its range westward to California and eastward up the Atlantic Coast. This voracious predator can reach extremely high densities and have widespread effects once it invades an ecosystem. We conducted a 2-yr sampling study and a series of greenhouse and field experiments to document the impact of red imported fire ants on beneficial insects in cotton. We found that the densities of 12 of 13 natural enemies sampled on cotton plants in 1999, and 8 out of 8 sampled in 2000, were negatively correlated with the densities of foraging fire ant workers. Red imported fire ants reduced the survival of lady beetles (Coccinella septempunctata L., and Hippodamia convergens Guérin-Méneville) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) by 50% and green lacewing larvae (Chrysoperla carnea Stephens) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) by 38% in greenhouse experiments. Fire ants did not, however, reduce the survival of spiders (Oxyopidae, Thomisidae, and Clubionidae). We used a commercially available fire ant bait to suppress fire ant populations in cotton fields during the 2000 growing season and compared the densities of beneficial arthropods in treated versus control fields. Densities of lady beetles, spiders, and big-eyed bugs (Heteroptera: Geocoridae) were significantly higher in fields with suppressed fire ant populations than in fields with relatively large fire ant populations. The effect of fire ants on minute pirate bugs (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) was inconsistent, and populations of damsel bugs (Heteroptera: Nabidae) and hooded beetles (Coleoptera: Anthicidae) were not affected by fire ant suppression. The results of this study suggest that red imported fire ants are major intraguild predators of important beneficial arthropods in cotton.",https://doi.org/10.1603/0046-225x-31.6.1168,0
525,"Intraguild predation and species exclusions in amphipods: the interaction of behaviour, physiology and environment","1. Data from field surveys, laboratory experiments and computer simulations of community dynamics revealed that a novel interaction among intraguild predation, physiological adaptation and environment may explain the complex distributions of two putatively competing aquatic amphipods. 2. Gammarus pulex and G. tigrinus both thrive in fresh and oligohaline waters in western Europe. However, the native European G. pulex excludes the invading North American G. tigrinus from freshwaters of relatively low conductivity, whereas the reverse occurs at higher conductivities. Additionally, there is much spatio‐temporal fluctuation in the patterns of coexistence of these species. 3. Laboratory experiments in The Netherlands and Ireland revealed that mutual predation of moulting individuals occurred frequently between these species. However, predation frequencies were differentially in favour of G. pulex under the ionic conditions to which this species is physiologically adapted (freshwater). On the other hand, predation was not differential under the ionic conditions to which G. tigrinus is physiologically adapted (oligohaline water). 4. A mathematical model, which extends the logistic equation to include mutual intraguild predation, simulated interactions over a range of values of relevant population parameters. This indicated that G. pulex would be excluded when balanced instantaneous rates of mutual predation were combined with the known greater reproductive output of G. tigrinus . However, this reproductive advantage is overcome by any relatively small bias in the instantaneous rate of predation favouring G. pulex , leading to the exclusion of G. tigrinus . This occurs even when the reproductive advantage to G. tigrinus is relatively large. Moreover, the model generated ‘switches’ in species dominance that are determined by the relative values of reproductive rate and mutual predation. The time taken to ‘switch’ may explain the transient periods of apparent coexistence of these species observed in the field. 5. The complex community dynamics of such species may thus be understood in terms of variation in the intensity of species interactions mediated by behavioural, physiological and environmental factors.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00106.x,0
526,INTRAGUILD PREDATION DRIVES EVOLUTIONARY NICHE SHIFT IN THREESPINE STICKLEBACK,"Intraguild predation--competition and predation by the same antagonist--is widespread, but its evolutionary consequences are unknown. Intraguild prey may evolve antipredator defenses, superior competitive ability on shared resources, or the ability to use an alternative resource, any of which may alter the structure of the food web. We tested for evolutionary responses by threespine stickleback to a benthic intraguild predator, prickly sculpin. We used a comparative morphometric analysis to show that stickleback sympatric with sculpin are more armored and have more limnetic-like body shapes than allopatric stickleback. To test the ecological implications of this shift, we conducted a mesocosm experiment that varied sculpin presence and stickleback population of origin (from one sympatric and one allopatric lake). Predation by sculpin greatly increased the mortality of allopatric stickleback. In contrast, sculpin presence did not affect the mortality of sympatric stickleback, although they did have lower growth rates suggesting increased nonpredatory effects of sculpin. Consistent with their morphology, sympatric stickleback included more pelagic prey in their diets, leading to depletion of zooplankton in the mesocosms. These findings suggest that intraguild prey evolution has altered food web structure by reducing both predation by the intraguild predator and diet overlap between species.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01545.x,0
527,Intraguild Predation and Native Lady Beetle Decline,"Coccinellid communities across North America have experienced significant changes in recent decades, with declines in several native species reported. One potential mechanism for these declines is interference competition via intraguild predation; specifically, increased predation of native coccinellid eggs and larvae following the introduction of exotic coccinellids. Our previous studies have shown that agricultural fields in Michigan support a higher diversity and abundance of exotic coccinellids than similar fields in Iowa, and that the landscape surrounding agricultural fields across the north central U.S. influences the abundance and activity of coccinellid species. The goal of this study was to quantify the amount of egg predation experienced by a native coccinellid within Michigan and Iowa soybean fields and explore the influence of local and large-scale landscape structure. Using the native lady beetle Coleomegilla maculata as a model, we found that sentinel egg masses were subject to intense predation within both Michigan and Iowa soybean fields, with 60.7% of egg masses attacked and 43.0% of available eggs consumed within 48 h. In Michigan, the exotic coccinellids Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis were the most abundant predators found in soybean fields whereas in Iowa, native species including C. maculata, Hippodamia parenthesis and the soft-winged flower beetle Collops nigriceps dominated the predator community. Predator abundance was greater in soybean fields within diverse landscapes, yet variation in predator numbers did not influence the intensity of egg predation observed. In contrast, the strongest predictor of native coccinellid egg predation was the composition of edge habitats bordering specific fields. Field sites surrounded by semi-natural habitats including forests, restored prairies, old fields, and pasturelands experienced greater egg predation than fields surrounded by other croplands. This study shows that intraguild predation by both native and exotic predators may contribute to native coccinellid decline, and that landscape structure interacts with local predator communities to shape the specific outcomes of predator-predator interactions.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0023576,0

A. clausi displayed a Holling type 3 functional response (which differed significantly from a type 2 response, p < 0.05) for ciliates when there was a constant abundance of algae present, and likewise for algae when there was a constant abundance of ciliates present. The results were implemented in a mathematical model to investigate the effect of different functional responses on a simple food web comprised of nutrient, algae, ciliates and copepods. In the model, ciliates and copepods competed for resources (algae) and ciliates were also prey for copepods. This blend of predation and competition among copepods and ciliates corresponds to intraguild predation as defined by Polis & Holt (1992; Trends Ecol Evol 7:151-154). Stable solutions with all state variables present were found over a range of nutrient concentrations when the copepods displayed type 3 functional responses. On the contrary, when copepods displayed type 2 responses, such stable solutions were only found at very low input nutrient concentrations. Coexistence of ciliates and copepods further required that ciliates had a lower threshold prey concentration for positive net growth than copepods.

529,Intraguild Predation and Cannibalism in Odonate Larvae: Effects of Foraging Behaviour and Zooplankton Availability,"presented individually and together. The large larvae of A. juncea showed high foraging activity irrespective of odonate prey treatment. Predation by A. juncea was lowest on Coenagrion hastulatum larvae, which had a 'sit and wait foraging mode, and highest on actively foraging Leucorrhinia dubia larvae. However, both activity and predation on L. dubia were lower in the presence of zooplankton and large A. juncea, perhaps reflecting avoidance of predation risk when foraging. Small larvae of A. juncea showed about the same foraging activity and vulnerability to predation as did L. dubia. Cordulia aenea larvae had intermediate foraging activity levels which were lower in the presence of zooplankton, but suffered high predation, indicating a low odonate predator escape ability. When all four odonate prey larvae were presented together, C. hastulatum and C. aenea experienced the lowest and highest predation, respectively, whereas predation on A. juncea and L. dubia was intermediate. About 25% of the large A. juncea larvae from field populations had preyed on L. dubia and C. hastulatum. The low abundances of A. juncea and C. aenea in the study ponds may explain why these species were not found in the fecal pellets of large A. juncea larvae. The results show that large A. juncea larvae frequently prey on odonate larvae. The intensity of this predation depends on the foraging behaviour of prey odonate larvae.

530,Intraguild predation reduces redundancy of predator species in multiple predator assemblage,"1. Interference between predator species frequently decreases predation rates, lowering the risk of predation for shared prey. However, such interference can also occur between conspecific predators. 2. Therefore, to understand the importance of predator biodiversity and the degree that predator species can be considered functionally interchangeable, we determined the degree of additivity and redundancy of predators in multiple- and single-species combinations. 3. We show that interference between two invasive species of predatory crabs, Carcinus maenas and Hemigrapsus sanguineus, reduced the risk of predation for shared amphipod prey, and had redundant per capita effects in most multiple- and single-species predator combinations. 4. However, when predator combinations with the potential for intraguild predation were examined, predator interference increased and predator redundancy decreased. 5. Our study indicates that trophic structure is important in determining how the effects of predator species combine and demonstrates the utility of determining the redundancy, as well as the additivity, of multiple predator species.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2006.01115.x,0

532,Spatial Dynamics of Communities with Intraguild Predation: The Role of Dispersal Strategies,"I investigate the influence of dispersal strategies on intraguild prey and predators (competing species that prey on each other). I find an asymmetry between the intraguild prey and predator in their responses to each other's dispersal. The intraguild predator's dispersal strategy and dispersal behavior have strong effects on the intraguild prey's abundance pattern, but the intraguild prey's dispersal strategy and behavior have little or no effect on the intraguild predator's abundance pattern. This asymmetry arises from the different constraints faced by the two species: the intraguild prey has to acquire resources while avoiding predation, but the intraguild predator only has to acquire resources. It leads to puzzling distribution patterns: when the intraguild prey and predator both move away from areas of high density, they become aggregated to high‐density habitats, but when they both move toward areas of high resource productivity, they become segregated to resource‐poor and resource‐rich habitats. Aggregation is more likely when dispersal is random or less optimal, and segregation is more likely as dispersal becomes more optimal. The crucial implication is that trophic constraints dictate the fitness benefits of using dispersal strategies to sample environmental heterogeneity. A strategy that affords greater benefits to an intraguild predator can lead to a more optimal outcome for both the intraguild predator and prey than a strategy that affords greater benefits to an intraguild prey.",https://doi.org/10.1086/522837,0
533,"TRADE-OFFS, TEMPORAL VARIATION, AND SPECIES COEXISTENCE IN COMMUNITIES WITH INTRAGUILD PREDATION","Intraguild predation/parasitism (IGP: competing species preying on or parasitizing each other) is widespread in nature, but the mechanisms by which intraguild prey and predators coexist remain elusive. Theory predicts that a trade-off between resource competition and IGP should allow local niche partitioning, but such trade-offs are expressed only at intermediate resource productivity and cannot explain observations of stable coexistence at high productivity. Coexistence must therefore involve additional mechanisms beside the trade-off, but very little is known about the operation of such mechanisms in nature. Here I present the first experimental test of multiple coexistence mechanisms in a natural community exhibiting IGP. The results suggest that, when resource productivity constrains the competition–IGP trade-off, a temporal refuge for the intraguild prey can not only promote coexistence, but also change species abundances to a pattern qualitatively different from that expected based on the trade-off or a refuge alone. This is the first empirical study to demonstrate a mechanism for why communities with IGP do not lose species diversity in highly productive environments. These results have implications for diversity maintenance in multi-trophic communities, and the use of multiple natural enemies in biological control.",https://doi.org/10.1890/06-1515.1,0
534,Nutritional benefits of intraguild predation and cannibalism among generalist and specialist phytoseiid mites,"Summary 1. Intraguild predation and cannibalism are common among predaceous phytoseiid mites (Acari, Phytoseiidae) but the nutritional benefits gained by these processes are poorly understood. 2. The study reported here addressed the questions of whether cannibalism and intraguild predation provide different nutritional benefits and whether the ability to utilise cannibalism and intraguild predation is linked to the diet specialisation of phytoseiid mites. Specialists tested were Phytoseiulus macropilis , Galendromus occidentalis , and Neoseiulus longispinosus; generalists tested were Amblyseius andersoni , Neoseiulus cucumeris , and Neoseiulus fallacis . 3. All generalists and the specialist P. macropilis were able to complete juvenile development with both con‐ and hetero‐specific prey. Juvenile development of generalists was shorter with heterospecific prey than with conspecific prey, whereas development of the specialist P. macropilis did not differ between prey types. Only a few N. longispinosus and G. occidentalis , both specialists, reached adulthood by cannibalism but none reached adulthood by intraguild predation. 4. All generalists were able to sustain oviposition by intraguild predation. Neoseiulus cucumeris and A. andersoni laid more eggs with heterospecific prey than with conspecific prey, whereas N. fallacis had similar oviposition rates with both prey types. No specialist sustained oviposition by intraguild predation or cannibalism. 5. Overall, generalists gained equal or more nutritional benefits by intraguild predation than by cannibalism and were able to utilise phytoseiid intraguild prey as an alternative food source. Specialists gained equal or more nutritional benefits from cannibalism than from intraguild predation. For specialists, con‐ and hetero‐specific phytoseiids may be considered only a supplemental food.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2311.2000.00284.x,0
535,<b>Generalist predators disrupt parasitoid aphid control by direct and coincidental intraguild predation</b>,"Abstract Generalist predators and parasitoids are considered to be important regulators of aphids. The former not only feed on these pests, but might also consume parasitoids at all stages of development. This direct or coincidental interference affects the natural control of aphids, the scale of which is largely unknown, and it has rarely been examined under natural conditions. Here, molecular diagnostics were used to track trophic interactions in an aphid-parasitoid-generalist predator community during the build-up of a cereal aphid population. We found that generalist predators, principally carabid and staphylinid beetles as well as linyphiid spiders, had strong trophic links to both parasitoids and aphids. Remarkably, more than 50% of the parasitoid DNA detected in predators stems from direct predation on adult parasitoids. The data also suggest that coincidental intraguild predation is common too. Generalist predators, hence, disrupt parasitoid aphid control, although the levels at which the predators feed on pests and parasitoids seem to vary significantly between predator taxa. Our results suggest that taxon-specific trophic interactions between natural enemies need to be considered to obtain a more complete understanding of the route to effective conservation biological control.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007485311000551,0
536,Intraguild predation of lynxes on foxes: evidence of interference competition?,"There is a growing focus among ecologists on the importance of predatory interactions between competing species, but because of its mixed character. it is difficult to pinpoint the possible, competitive component of the interaction. We tested degree of prey consumption in intraguild predation of Eurasian lynxes on red foxes against assumed ‘pure’ predation. i.e, roe deer and mountain hares. The proportion of uneaten fox carcasses was highly significantly larger than the proportion of both other prey species, indicating that interference competition may play a role in the intraguild predation of lynxes on red foxes.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1999.tb01281.x,0
537,Intraguild predation in winter wheat: prey choice by a common epigeal carabid consuming spiders,"Summary Predators can provide a valuable ecosystem service by suppressing crop pests. However, intraguild predation, where predators compete for the same prey resource whilst consuming each other, may destabilize population dynamics and increase the risk of pest outbreaks. Very little is known about intraguild predation in open fields or the strengths of trophic links between predators which may negatively affect pest control. We tested the null hypothesis that predation by the epigeal predator Pterostichus melanarius (Coleoptera: Carabidae) on different spiders is species‐independent (proportional to density). A combination of population monitoring in winter wheat, molecular identification of juvenile spiders, molecular analysis of predator gut contents and a Monte Carlo simulation model were used to analyse prey choice. Pterostichus melanarius were pitfall‐trapped over three months, and 622 individuals were screened for the remains of four spider species. Predation rates on spiders were 43·6% in June and 33·3% in August and showed clear evidence of prey choice. Predation on the web‐dependent Tenuiphantes tenuis (Linyphiidae) was significantly greater than predicted from a random choice model, while predation on Bathyphantes gracilis (Linyphiidae) was significantly lower. The beetles may be selecting the most abundant species disproportionately (switching) or responding in some cases to spatial niche separation ( T. tenuis locate their webs marginally lower than B. gracilis ). However, two itinerant hunters, Erigone spp. (Linyphiidae) and Pachygnatha degeeri (Tetragnathidae), were consumed in proportion to their density. Synthesis and applications . High levels of intraguild predation were revealed using molecular diagnostics. The gut analysis approach provided invaluable data that will inform the future design of appropriate pest management and integrated farming strategies that encourage these predators. The data showed strong evidence of prey choice. Managers can, however, probably encourage high densities of all these known aphid predators (spiders and carabids) because disproportionately high rates of predation on the most common spiders at our field sites ( T. tenuis ) were not sufficient to prevent strong growth in the density of this species between June and August (adults increased × 1·6 and juveniles × 8·6). Such work is essential if we are to reveal the processes behind functional biodiversity in crops.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12008,0
538,Facultative Intraguild Predation by Larval Cerambycidae (Coleoptera) on Bark Beetle Larvae (Coleoptera: Scolytidae): Fig. 1.,"Larvae of the Carolina sawyer Monochamus carolinensis (Olivier) (Cerambycidae) and bark beetle larvae (Scolytidae) often simultaneously feed in phloem of recently killed pine trees. Our investigations reveal that M. carolinensis larvae may act as facultative intraguild predators of bark beetle larvae. Phloem sandwiches were used in four experiments to examine inter- and intraspecific interactions. We discovered that all sizes of M. carolinensis larvae killed bark beetle larvae. Seventy-six percent of the killed bark beetle larvae were consumed by M. carolinensis, including 58% that were entirely ingested. Cannibalism in M. carolinensis occurred in every experimental trial. Based on this evidence, M. carolinensis, and possibly related cerambycid species associated with bark beetles, are facultative intraguild predators of larvae of other phloem inhabiting species. The consequences of this behavior may have important implications for bark beetle population dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1603/0046-225x-30.1.17,0
539,"Intraguild predation between an introduced lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and a native lady beetle, Coleomegilla maculata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae).","The introduction of the multicolored Asian lady beetle, Harmonio axyridis Pallas (Cole?ptera: Coccinellidae), to the United States has led to its interaction with native coccinellid species. Harmon?a axyridis adults and larvae co-occur temporally and spatially with adults and larvae of the native species, Coleomegilla maculata (DeGeer), which is the most abundant coccinellid species on sweet corn in Kentucky. We tested the capability of H. axyridis to develop on a diet of only C. maculata eggs and the propensity for either species to prey upon the other. We found that H. axyridis larvae can complete development on a diet of only C. maculata eggs and that pr?dation between H. axyridis and C. maculata larvae usu ally results in H. axyridis eating C. maculata. The multicolored Asian lady beetle (Harmonio axyridis Pallas [Cole?ptera: Coc cinellidae]) was introduced into the United States as a biological control agent of several arboreal homopteran pests. Repeated releases of H. axyridis were made in several states starting in 1916, and now this beetle is found throughout much of the United States (Gordon, 1985; Tedders and Schaefer, 1994; LaMana and Miller, 1996). Since the first detection ofH. axyridis in Kentucky during 1992, it has been found in that state on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) and sweet corn (Zea mays L.) (Pfan nenstiel, 1995; Cottrell and Yeargan, 1998a, b), in addition to arboreal habitats. Dur ing our field studies on the native lady beetle Coleomegilla maculata (DeGeer) in sweet corn, we noted that H. axyridis (adults and larvae combined) was the second most frequently observed predator species feeding on C. maculata eggs on sweet corn (Cottrell and Yeargan, 1998a, b). Additionally, an observation was made of a late-instar H axyridis eating a late-instar C. maculata on sweet corn in the field (T. E. Cottrell, pers. obs.). In the laboratory, when reared in petri dishes with food and water provided ad li bitum, approximately ten C maculata larvae could be kept in single 9-cm-diameter petri dishes through pupation with little or no cannibalism. However, when H axyridis larvae were reared in this manner, cannibalism sometimes occurred, even though excess food was provided (T. E. Cottrell, pers. obs.). From our field and lab oratory observations, H axyridis larvae appeared more aggressive than C maculata larvae. Our primary objective was to determine, under controlled conditions, the out come of intraguild pr?dation between these coccinellid species. We also determined whether the invading species could utililize eggs of the native species as a food source. Finally, as an index of relative aggressiveness of the two species, we exam ined the tendency of each species to cannibalize similar-sized larvae. 1 Current address: United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service, South eastern Fruit and Tree Nut Research Laboratory, 21 Dunbar Road, Byron, Georgia 31008.

These colonies were used for collection of eggs and larvae used in pr?dation and cannibalism studies. Colonies were maintained at 27 ? 1?C and a photoperiod of 15:9 (L:D) hr in an environmental chamber. Indi vidual adults were kept in 9-cm-diameter petri dishes and provided a blended beef diet (100 g beef liver, 100 g ground beef, and 12 ml of 5% sucrose [wt/vol]) wrapped in laboratory film (Parafilm M' American Can Company, Greenwich, CT) (Cohen, 1985). The diet of//, axyridis adults was occasionally supplemented with Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) eggs to increase the beetles' egg production. Water was provided by placing a moistened, cotton dental wick in the petri dish. Green floral paper was cut into 10-cm-diameter circles and used to line lids of petri dishes containing adult, female coccinellids. This paper provided females with an oviposi tional substrate which was easily removed and replaced. Egg clusters were collected daily. Helicoverpa zea eggs were collected from a laboratory colony maintained by methods modified from Ignoffo (1965) at 15:9 (L:D) hr and room temperature. Pr?dation of C. maculata eggs by H. axyridis was examined by placing 30 unfed first-instar H. axyridis larvae individually into 9-cm-diameter petri dishes with a moistened cotton dental wick for a water source, and providing C. maculata eggs, ad libitum, daily. Data were recorded for number of larvae surviving through each instar, pupal stage, and for emerged adults. To obtain larvae of the appropriate size or instar for our studies of larval pr?da tion and cannibalism, larvae of both species were reared singly in 9-cm-diameter petri dishes at 15:9 (L:D) hr and 27 ? 1?C with H. zea eggs ad libitum for food and a moistened cotton dental wick for a water source. All pr?dation and cannibalism experiments were done in 9-cm-diameter petri dishes in environmental chambers at 15:9 (L:D) hr and 27 ? 1?C. No food or water was provided during the intraguild pr?dation or cannibalism experiments, but an open container of water was placed at the bottom of the incubator to increase humidity. Thirty-one second-instar H. axyridis were paired with second-instar C. maculata and, after 24 hr, numbers of live and eaten larvae of each species were recorded. A 2 x 2 contingency table was used to compare totals for live and eaten H. axyridis with live and eaten C. maculata. We used Yates' correction for continuity to calculate %2 because the degrees of freedom = 1 (Zar, 1996). Intraguild pr?dation was examined and analyzed in the same man ner for the following combinations of H. axyridis and C. maculata: fourth-instar H. axyridis versus fourth-instar C. maculata (N = 35 pairs) and first-instar H. axyridis versus third-instar C. maculata (N = 36 pairs). In addition to testing intraguild pr? dation between specific instars, we also tested it for individuals that were similar in size. For that experiment we weighed third-instar H. axyridis and fourth-instar C. maculata using a Mettler AE 163 balance (Mettler-Toledo, Inc., Worthington, OH), and 31 H. axyridis third instars were paired with similar-weight C. maculata fourth instars. Because these individuals were similar in size, we felt that they might require a longer period to engage in intraguild pr?dation. Thus, data were recorded at 24 hr and again at 96 hr, and results were analyzed for each time as previously described. Twenty pairs of fourth-instar C. maculata were set up as described for intraguild pr?dation experiments above and cannibalism was recorded after 24 hr. Similarly, 36 pairs of fourth-instar H. axyridis were examined after 24 hr and cannibalism was recorded.

540,Intraguild predation in the presence of a shared natural enemy,"Intraguild predation (IGP) is a widespread phenomenon in nature, and yet the simplest theoretical models of IGP predict that coexistence of intraguild predator and prey is only possible under restrictive assumptions. Here I examine how a specialist or generalist natural enemy of these species affects their long-term persistence and abundance, as functions of the natural enemy's relative attack severity and fecundity on each species. Notably, I show that failure to include the effects of a higher trophic level in models of IGP can lead to incorrect predictions about the coexistence or exclusion of guild members. I then consider how an interaction between native species and a natural enemy is perturbed by the arrival of an invasive intraguild predator. I outline the conditions under which the native species and/or its natural enemy are threatened by the arrival of the intraguild predator, and also when the natural enemy is beneficial in preventing the initial invasion or eventual dominance of the invader. This work provides new insights on the influence of omnivory on food web stability, and also generates testable hypotheses for predicting the impact of a novel intraguild predator on the recipient community at multiple trophic levels.",https://doi.org/10.1890/09-2314.1,0
541,Testing intraguild predation theory in a field system: does numerical dominance shift along a gradient of productivity?,"Abstract Although ecological theory exists to predict dynamics in communities with intraguild predation (IGP), few empirical tests have examined this theory. IGP theory, in particular, predicts that when two competitors interact via IGP, with increasing resource productivity: (1) the IG predator will increase in abundance as the IG prey declines, and (2) increasing dominance of the IG predator will cause resource density to increase. Here, we provide a first test of these predictions in a field community consisting of a scale insect and its two specialist parasitoids, Aphytis melinus (the IG predator) and Encarsia perniciosi (the IG prey). The shared resource, California red scale, is a pest of citrus, and its productivity varies across a threefold range among citrus cultivars. We examined both absolute and relative densities of parasitoids along this natural gradient of scale productivity in three citrus cultivars (orange, grapefruit and lemon). Although both parasitoid species were found in all three cultivars, their abundances reflected those predicted by IGP theory: the IG prey species dominated at low productivity and the IG predator dominated at high productivity. This relationship was caused by an increase in Aphytis density with productivity. In addition, the density of scale increased with the dominance of the IG predator. These results from a field system demonstrate the important dynamic outcomes for food webs with IGP.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1461-0248.2003.00515.x,0
542,Reciprocal intraguild predation and predator coexistence,"Abstract Intraguild predation is a mix of competition and predation and occurs when one species feeds on another species that uses similar resources. Theory predicts that intraguild predation hampers coexistence of species involved, but it is common in nature. It has been suggested that increasing habitat complexity and the presence of alternative food may promote coexistence. Reciprocal intraguild predation limits possibilities for coexistence even further. Habitat complexity and the presence of alternative food are believed to promote coexistence. We investigated this using two species of predatory mites, Iphiseiodes zuluagai and Euseius concordis , by assessing co‐occurrence in the field and on arenas differing in spatial structure in the laboratory. The predators co‐occured on the same plants in the field. In the laboratory, adults of the two mites fed on juveniles of the other species, both in the presence and the absence of a shared food source, showing that the two species are involved in reciprocal intraguild predation. Adults of I. zuluagai also attacked adults of E. concordis . This suggests limited possibilities for coexistence of the two species. Indeed, E. concordis invariably went extinct extremely rapidly on arenas without spatial structure with populations consisting of all stages of the two predators and with a shared resource. Coexistence was prolonged on host plant leaves with extra food sources, but E. concordis still went extinct. On small, intact plants, coexistence of the two species was much longer, and ended with the other species, I. zuluagai , often going extinct. These results suggest that spatial structure and the presence of alternative food increase the coexistence period of intraguild predators.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.4211,0
543,"SIZE DEPENDENT INTRAGUILD PREDATION AND CANNIBALISM IN COEXISTING WOLF SPIDERS (ARANEAE, LYCOSIDAE)","Two species of wolf spider, Hogna helluo (Walckenaer 1837) and Pardosa milvina Hentz 1844 dominate the predatory community on the soil surface of agroecosystems in eastern North America. Although as adults they are very different in size, differences in phenology ensure that they overlap in size at various times during the year. In a laboratory experiment, we explored the propensity of each species to attack and kill the other wolf spider species (intraguild predation), conspecifics (cannibalism) or crickets (ordinary predation). Both spiders attacked and killed a broader size range of crickets more quickly than they approached other spiders. We found no differences in Hogna foraging on conspecifics or Pardosa, but Pardosa attacked and killed Hogna more readily than conspecifics. Because Hogna was so slow in attacking other spiders, their impact as an intraguild predator may be quite small, especially if their approach to crickets is an indication of their predatory tendencies with insects. On the other hand, Pardosa attacked and killed small Hogna as readily as crickets, which suggests they may have an influence on Hogna populations if Hogna young emerge coincident with large juvenile or adult Pardosa.",https://doi.org/10.1636/ct05-10.1,0
544,Leaf pubescence mediates intraguild predation between predatory mites,"Plant morphological traits such as leaf pubescence may affect herbivores and their natural enemies at the individual, population and community levels. Leaf pubescence has been repeatedly shown to mediate predator‐herbivore interactions whereas the influence of leaf pubescence on predator–predator interactions such as intraguild predation (IGP) has seldom been investigated. Using a three‐pronged approach we assessed the influence of leaf pubescence on the predatory mites Kampimodromus aberrans and Euseius finlandicus . Both predators occur on broad‐leaved trees in Europe. Euseius finlandicus is mostly found on trees with glabrous leaves whereas K. aberrans mainly occurs on trees with pubescent leaves. We hypothesized that leaf pubescence mediates IGP between K. aberrans and E. finlandicus and thereby determines their dominance and proportional abundance. A field survey on apple revealed that the abundance of K. aberrans and E. finlandicus is negatively correlated, with the former predominating on cultivars with strongly pubescent leaves and the latter predominating on cultivars with little pubescent or glabrous leaves. Microhabitat choice tests showed that K. aberrans preferentially resides on pubescent leaves whereas E. finlandicus preferentially resides on glabrous leaves. The effects of leaf pubescence on survival and development of immature IG predators and IG prey were reversed for K. aberrans and E. finlandicus . In the presence of the IG predator E. finlandicus , immature K. aberrans had higher survival probabilities on pubescent leaves than on glabrous ones. In contrast, the survival chances of immature E. finlandicus were higher on glabrous leaves than on pubescent ones when the IG predator K. aberrans was present. Artificial leaf pubescence enhanced IG prey capture by immature K. aberrans and prolonged their longevity but impaired IG prey capture by immature E. finlandicus and shortened their longevity. We conclude that leaf pubescence mediates IGP strength and symmetry and discuss the implications to natural and biological control.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2007.15895.x,0
545,Coexistence of Predator and Prey in Intraguild Predation Systems with Ontogenetic Niche Shifts,"In basic intraguild predation (IGP) systems, predators and prey also compete for a shared resource. Theory predicts that persistence of these systems is possible when intraguild prey is superior in competition and productivity is not too high. IGP often results from ontogenetic niche shifts, in which the diet of intraguild predators changes as a result of growth in body size (life-history omnivory). As a juvenile, a life-history omnivore competes with the species that becomes its prey later in life. Competition can hence limit growth of young predators, while adult predators can suppress consumers and therewith neutralize negative effects of competition. We formulate and analyze a stage-structured model that captures both basic IGP and life-history omnivory. The model predicts increasing coexistence of predators and consumers when resource use of stage-structured predators becomes more stage specific. This coexistence depends on adult predators requiring consumer biomass for reproduction and is less likely when consumers outcompete juvenile predators, in contrast to basic IGP. Therefore, coexistence occurs when predation structures the community and competition is negligible. Consequently, equilibrium patterns over productivity resemble those of three-species food chains. Life-history omnivory thus provides a mechanism that allows intraguild predators and prey to coexist over a wide range of resource productivity.",https://doi.org/10.1086/662676,0
546,Intraguild predation in larval parasitoids: implications for coexistence,"Summary Many coexisting parasitoids interact via intraguild predation (IGP); however, in IGP theory without stage structure the intraguild predator and intraguild prey coexist via this mechanism over only a relatively narrow region of parameter space. A recent formulation of IGP theory with a stage of the intraguild prey species that is invulnerable to attack by the intraguild predator shows that coexistence between guild members can occur across a much broader range of resource productivity than is predicted by IGP theory without stage structure. These general theoretical predictions are used to explore the implications for coexistence of Aphytis melinus (DeBach) and Encarsia perniciosi (Tower), a pair of parasitoids that coexist on California red scale. Reanalysis of a published laboratory competition experiment between two parasitoid species suggests that Aphytis , an ectoparasitoid, survives at a lower rate when the reparasitized host contains a more developed juvenile endoparasitoid ( Encarsia ). This pattern is contrary to a common assumption that ectoparasitoids always consume endoparasitoids in a shared host, and may affect coexistence. The experiment covered only the first ∼30% of the Encarsia development period and did not describe the outcome for Encarsia , so the dynamic effects of this interaction in the context of IGP remain unclear. In addition, Encarsia is capable of parasitizing much younger hosts than is Aphytis , which the experiment did not examine. The experiment was repeated, and extended to cover the full developmental duration of Encarsia . An additional experiment was performed to explore whether Encarsia could pre‐empt Aphytis by attacking younger hosts. Aphytis juvenile survival was found to decrease as a function of the age of the juvenile Encarsia onto which it was laid. When Encarsia parasitized very young hosts, it was increasingly invulnerable to attack by Aphytis and increasingly more likely to survive to emergence. However, until the formation of an invulnerable pseudomoult, Encarsia was always killed in larger hosts, regardless of its age at the time of Aphytis attack. According to stage‐structured IGP theory, the decline in Aphytis success combined with an invulnerable Encarsia stage may promote coexistence in this system.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2656.2002.00660.x,0
547,Evolutionarily Driven Shifts in Communities with Intraguild Predation,"Recent studies investigating feedbacks between evolution and ecology suggest that microevolution may affect community structure. Motivated by this, we use a quantitative genetics and Lotka-Volterra framework to understand the impact of eco-evolutionary feedbacks on an intraguild predation community in which the intraguild predator evolves between a phenotype specialized for attacking its competitor (the intraguild prey) and a phenotype specialized for attacking a common resource. We show that evolution can drive both sudden and gradual shifts in community structure. Evolutionary rescue of the community, in which evolution prevents the loss of species, occurs in two ways: (i) selection to a particular phenotype that supports coexistence and (ii) continuous evolution between prey- and resource-specialist phenotypes that support community-level Red Queen dynamics in which the community fluctuates between prey- and predator-dominated states. Paradoxically, the predator can evolve to extirpate itself from the community provided that the ecological dynamics support bistability. Strong trade-offs between specialist phenotypes can lead to trait-based alternative states of the community resembling either a food chain or exploitative competition. Finally, we show that rapid evolution can stabilize equilibria that are unstable for the ecological dynamics, whereas slow evolution can stabilize equilibria that are unstable for the evolutionary dynamics. Our results demonstrate that eco-evolutionary feedbacks can drive shifts in community structure and that the overall dynamics depend on the trade-off strength and evolutionary rate.",https://doi.org/10.1086/683170,0
548,Intraguild predation enhances biodiversity and functioning in complex food webs,"Abstract Intraguild predation ( IGP ), that is, feeding interaction between two consumers that share the same resource species, is commonly observed in natural food webs. IGP expands vertical niche space and slows down energy flows from lower to higher trophic levels, which potentially affects the diversity and dynamics of food webs. Here, we use food‐web models to investigate the effects of IGP on species diversity and ecosystem functioning. We first simulate a five‐species food‐web module with different strengths of IGP at the herbivore and/or carnivore level. Results show that as the strength of IGP within a trophic level increases, the biomass of its resource level increases because of predation release; this increased biomass in turn alters the energy fluxes and biomass of other trophic levels. These results are then extended by subsequent simulations of more diverse food webs. As the strength of IGP increases, simulated food webs maintain (1) higher species diversity at different trophic levels, (2) higher total biomasses at different trophic levels, and (3) larger energy fluxes across trophic levels. Our results challenge the intuitive hypothesis that food‐web structure should maximize the efficiency of energy transfer across trophic levels; instead, they suggest that the assembly of food webs should be governed by a balance between efficiency (of energy transfer) and persistence (i.e., the maintenance of species and biomasses). Our simulations also show that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (e.g., total biomass or primary production) is much stronger in the presence of IGP , reconciling the contrast from recent studies based on food‐chain and food‐web models. Our findings shed new light on the functional role of IGP and contribute to resolving the debate on structure, diversity and functioning in complex food webs.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2616,0
549,Intraguild predation may explain an amphipod replacement: evidence from laboratory populations,"Abstract In a laboratory experiment that permitted both observations of the behaviour of individuals and the monitoring of small populations, the role of ‘intraguild predation’ in the elimination of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus duebeni celticus by the introduced G. pulex was examined. Over 18 weeks, deaths in single and mixed species replicates were monitored. Rates of ‘mortality’ (deaths not due to cannibalism or predation) did not differ between the species. Gammarus d. celticus , however, was more cannibalistic than G. pulex and, in both species, males were more often cannibalized than females. In mixed species replicates, the mean proportions of animals preyed upon did not differ among replicates with differing starting proportions of the two species, nor was there a difference between the sexes in numbers preyed upon. G. pulex , however, preyed more frequently on G. d. celticus than vice versa, and this became more pronounced over time. In 87% of mixed species replicates, G. pulex eliminated G. d. celticus . The results support the proposition that intraguild predation may be the primary mechanism whereby G. pulex rapidly replaces G. d. celticus in freshwater. Integrating behavioural observations with population level monitoring may thus link pattern and process in behaviour and ecology.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1999.tb01216.x,0
550,"Intraguild predation between erigonid spiders, lacewing larvae and carabids","Abstract: Petri dish experiments were conducted to study intraguild predation (IGP) between erigonid spiders ( Erigone atra (Blackwall), Oedothorax apicatus (Blackwall), a carabid beetle ( Pterostichus melanarius (Ill.) and lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) larvae. Erigonid spiders increased the mortality rates of lacewing larvae to different degrees, depending on the species and sex of spider concerned. The effect of spiders on lacewing larvae was highest (up to nearly 100% mortality) in the absence of alternative prey. In the presence of three or 20 aphids ( Sitobion avenae Fab.) female erigonids increased the mortality rates of lacewing larvae compared to controls, but predation on lacewing larvae decreased in the presence of increasing numbers of aphids. Males of O. apicatus caused no significant increase in mortality rate of lacewing larvae in the presence of aphids. Lacewing larvae (L2‐larvae and L3‐larvae) did not kill erigonid spiders. IGP between the female erigonids E. atra and O. apicatus was not found. P. melanarius fed on lacewing larvae and on erigonid spiders, and E. atra was preferred over O. apicatus. The sex‐specific and species‐specific IGP rates of spiders on lacewing larvae and the great influence of alternative prey on IGP rate reveal a general problem when data resulting from one sexual stage or one species or one feeding regime are generalized to a whole arthropod group. Moreover, the results suggest that an increase of top predators, such as carabid beetles, which prey only to a limited extent on the pest species itself, may affect natural insect pest control by IGP.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.1998.tb01479.x,0
551,The roles of habitat and intraguild predation by coyotes on the spatial dynamics of kit foxes,"Abstract Intraguild predation (IGP) by a dominant predator can drive the spatial dynamics of a subordinate predator and may explain space‐use patterns that deviate from theoretical predictions that species will use areas that maximize the availability of limited resources (resource availability hypothesis). Intraguild predation may suppress the distribution and abundance of mesopredators, but spatial resource partitioning may facilitate coexistence, with the subordinate carnivore utilizing suboptimal habitats. In arid systems, free‐standing water was historically scarce, limiting the distribution of larger‐bodied predators and offering large areas of refugia for smaller, arid‐adapted species, such as the kit fox ( Vulpes macrotis ). In these systems, the development of artificial water sources may facilitate an increase in the distribution and abundance of larger carnivores (e.g., coyotes [ Canis latrans ]), perhaps to the detriment of kit foxes. We coupled noninvasive genetic sampling and dynamic occupancy models to evaluate the spatial dynamics of kit foxes and their intraguild predators, coyotes, in western Utah, United States. We evaluated the influence of habitat characteristics on coyote occupancy patterns, and then investigated the role of habitat and coyotes on kit fox space use at multiple scales. Coyote occupancy was unrelated to water availability, but was positively related to the proportion of shrubland and woodland cover, a pattern consistent with predictions of the resource availability hypothesis. Supporting predictions of IGP theory, kit fox occupancy was negatively related to shrubland and woodland cover, minimizing overlap with land‐cover types favoring coyote occupancy. Furthermore, kit fox probability of local extinction was positively related to coyote activity. Interestingly, kit fox detection was positively related to coyote activity (i.e., kit fox detection was higher on spatial surveys with greater coyote sign), suggesting that at finer scales, kit foxes utilized riskier habitats to secure sufficient resources. Our results identified two alternative states predicted by IGP theory (i.e., intraguild predator dominated and coexistence of intraguild predator and intraguild prey) in a single system and elucidated the importance of considering dynamic processes and scale when investigating IGP.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1749,0
552,Impact of intraguild predation on parasitoid foraging behaviour,"1. Trophic interactions between predators and parasitoids can be described as intraguild predation (IGP) and are often asymmetric. Parasitoids (typically the IG prey) may respond to the threat of IGP by mitigating the predation risk for their offspring. 2. We used a system with a facultative predator Macrolophus caliginosus , the parasitoid Aphidius colemani , and their shared prey, the aphid Myzus persicae . We examined the functional responses of the parasitoid in the presence/absence of the predator on two host plants (aubergine and sweet pepper) with differing IGP risk. 3. Estimated model parameters such as parasitoid handling time increased on both plants where the predator was present, but impact of the predator varied with plant species. The predator, which could feed herbivorously on aubergine, had a reduced impact on parasitoid foraging on that plant. IG predator presence could reduce the searching effort of the IG prey depending on the plant, and on likely predation risk. 4. The results are discussed with regard to individual parasitoid's foraging behaviour and population stability; it is suggested that the presence of the predator can contribute to the stabilisation of host–parasitoid dynamics",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2009.01171.x,0

Concepción, PO Box 297, Concepción, Chile 2Center for Advanced Studies in Ecology and Biodiversity, P. Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile *Email: pcamus@ucsc.cl ABSTRACT: We assessed the ingestion of animal items by 29 herbivore species of the most common invertebrates on rocky intertidal shores of northern Chile (21 to 30°S). Data were obtained from 4 communities sampled seasonally from winter 2004 to spring 2005. Gastric contents of 2671 individuals were categorized into 143 food items, 42.7% of them corresponding to animal prey. All herbivores were polyphagous generalists, showing a moderate to high dietary overlap and suggesting the potential for exploitation competition. Diet width and the proportion of animal items ingested per species were positively related with body mass, revealing a high potential for true omnivory among larger herbivores. Barnacles were the dominant prey item, followed by a suite of common intertidal animals, including herbivore species. The consumption of herbivores was defined as apparent intraguild (IG) predation, a framework that we used by analogy to describe pairwise interactions at a regional and community level. We recorded 29 IG predator–IG prey interactions, all of them asymmetrical (no reciprocal predation), and directed exclusively towards heterospecific IG prey, which in most cases were juvenile individuals that were taxonomically unrelated. All IG predators were large herbivore species, and they appeared to avoid consuming conspecifics. The high incidence of polyphagy and apparent IG predation may not be simply an epiphenomenon of grazing, nor a response to limited algal resources, and we discuss the nature of herbivores as consumers and the implications of potential omnivory for the connectedness, looping, and chain length of intertidal food webs.

554,Intraguild predation and competition: an analysis of net growth shifts in larval amphibian prey,"This study examines the net shift in prey growth among species of aquatic salamander larvae (Ambystoma) that engage in intraguild prédation and competition with their predators. Larval salamander and frog species were studied in a pen experiment in a natural pond. A 2 × 3 factorial experimental design was used. The factors were (i) the presence (11 per pen) or absence of Ambystoma opacum predators, and (ii) three levels of Ambystoma jeffersonianum (42, 84, and 168 per pen), a prey species that also shares resources with A. opacum. All other species were stocked at constant levels. Mass at metamorphosis of A. jeffersonianum was not affected by predator presence. The larval period of A. jeffersonianum (prey) decreased by 20 d in the presence of A. opacum (predators), suggesting enhanced differentiation rate when predators reduced prey populations. Ambystoma maculatum (another prey species) showed no growth responses across experimental treatments, probably because it faced predation from both A. opacum and A. jeffersonianum. A previous study showed that in the absence of both A. opacum and A. jeffersonianum predators, A. maculatum prey manifested reduced mass at metamorphosis. Thus, among these predators and prey, which share resources, the enhanced differentiation rate or larger metamorphic size that prey experienced in reduced prey populations was more important than any negative impact of depressed shared resource levels among predators and prey.",https://doi.org/10.1139/z88-262,0
555,How functional response and productivity modulate intraguild predation,"Numerous models have been developed to predict the effect of environmental productivity on the coexistence of prey and predators within the three‐species module of intraguild predation. Theoretical models have mainly used Holling Type I and Type II functional response, the latter typically best describing the functional response of a predator. However, no empirical study has simultaneously examined the form of the functional response and the effect of prey density on intraguild interactions. This is surprising considering that the strength of the functional response is crucially important for the stability of simple predator‐prey systems and the persistence, sustainability and biodiversity of communities. In this study, we first developed a linear and a nonlinear functional response model for intraguild predators and next used a plant–aphid–predator mesocosm to parameterize the models and test their predictions at different prey densities. As expected, the assumptions of the linear model are not supported by empirical results which lead to systemic overestimation of the predation rate and the intensity of intraguild predation. On the other hand, the predictions of the nonlinear functional response model fit very well with experimental observations mainly because key behavioral characteristics such as handling time are integrated in this model. The nonlinear model is thus a good predictor of intraguild predation and allows a better understanding of how environmental productivity and predator behavior influence the occurrence and outcome of multiple predator interactions.",https://doi.org/10.1890/es12-00379.1,0

Special attention is given to understanding how the trophic ecology of PF can affect sardine population dynamics, which have been declining in recent years. Diet composition was estimated for juvenile and adult fish collected off the western and southern Iberian coasts during spring by determining the contribution of different prey types and prey size-classes to total dietary carbon. Results show that PF have highly diversified diets, with mesozooplankton and prey ranging from 1000 to 2000 µm being the major contributors to total dietary carbon. Calanoid copepods were important prey for all PF. Despite these similarities, there were significant differences in diet composition between areas, species, and maturity stages. Small prey such as phytoplankton, crustacean eggs, nauplii and small copepods were particularly important for the diet of sardines and juvenile chub mackerel. Prey >1500 µm (including decapod larvae, euphausiids and mysids) were mostly important for anchovies, adult chub mackerel, bogue, horse mackerel, jack mackerel and Mediterranean horse mackerel. Chub mackerel juveniles had the highest diet overlap with sardines. Sardine and chub mackerel juveniles, followed by bogue, were the main predators of fish eggs, particularly those of sardines, suggesting further investigation of their role in egg mortality and recruitment strength. This is particularly relevant given the recent northward expansion of chub mackerel into the main spawning grounds of sardines off the WIUE.

557,The importance of intraguild predation in predicting emergent multiple predator effects,"Prey typically coexist with multiple predator species, each of which presents a predation risk related to its habitat domain and foraging mode. These predator characteristics can be used to predict how the risk from multiple predators will combine to create emergent multiple predator effects for shared prey. Interactions between predators, particularly intraguild predation, can strongly alter prey suppression, though the importance of intraguild predation in multiple predator effects has not been explicitly explored. Furthermore, the vast majority of studies on multiple predator effects has focused on shared prey that are herbivorous, thus experiments focused on mesopredators are needed to evaluate the generality of conclusions made about multiple predator effects. We used a suite of carnivorous arthropods to test a predictive framework of multiple predator effects and to evaluate the role of intraguild predation in shaping these effects. We allowed the wolf spiders Pardosa milvina , Tigrosa helluo , and Rabidosa rabida and the ground beetle Scarites quadriceps to interact and recorded the outcome of all predatory events. We used two tests of multiple predator effects to determine whether predators created risk enhancement, risk reduction, or were substitutable. We found that the occurrence of intraguild predation decreased the overall risk to prey, causing observed multiple predator effects to deviate from predictions. Additionally, we highlight the importance of considering predator identity, as predators were capable of increasing, decreasing, or not altering the success of their competitors. Our study demonstrates that intraguild predation is a critical factor in determining how the risk from multiple predators will combine to affect their prey.",https://doi.org/10.1890/13-2347.1,0
558,Leaf domatia reduce intraguild predation among predatory mites,"1. Although theory suggests that intraguild predation destabilises food webs and may result in exclusion of species, empirical observations of food webs reveal that it is a common interaction. It has been proposed that habitat structure reduces the interaction strength of intraguild predation, thus facilitating the coexistence of species. 2. This was tested using acarodomatia, tiny structures on plant leaves, and predatory mites, which usually reside in these domatia. Sweet pepper plants (Capsicum annuum L.) were used, which possess domatia consisting of tufts of hair, and coffee plants (Coffea arabica L.) with pit-shaped domatia. 3. On sweet pepper, the predatory mites Neoseiulus cucumeris Oudemans and Iphiseius degenerans Berl. feed on each other's juveniles. Larvae of each of the species were therefore used as intraguild prey with adult females of the other species as intraguild predators. On coffee, a similar set-up was used, with larvae and adult females of Amblyseius herbicolus Chant and Iphiseiodes zuluagai Denmark & Muma as intraguild prey and intraguild predators, respectively. 4. Domatia on detached, isolated sweet pepper and coffee leaves were either closed with glue or left open, after which larvae and adult predators were released. As a control, larvae were released on leaves with open or closed domatia without an adult predator. 5. Survival of larvae was high in the absence of the adult (intraguild) predator. In the presence of the intraguild predator, survival was significantly higher on leaves with open domatia than on leaves with closed domatia. 6. This shows that even such tiny structures as plant domatia may significantly affect the interaction strength of intraguild predation.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2011.01286.x,0
559,Role of intraguild predation in aphidophagous guilds,"Abstract The concept of intraguild predation (IGP) appeared in 1987–1989 to describe trophic interactions within a guild of arthropods inhabiting a sand dune desert: consumers B prey on consumers A and both of them prey on a common resource. Theory predicts that the two types of consumers should only coexist if consumer A is more efficient in the conversion of the common resource than B. As a consequence, this resource is more abundant in the presence than in the absence of intraguild predators. Such a theoretical prediction probably explains the vivid interest shown by ecologists involved in biological control for IGP. It is therefore not surprising that many papers report on IGP among natural enemies of aphids. A close examination of these reported cases indicates that they rarely fulfil the theoretical requirements for IGP. That is, guilds of aphidophagous insects are rarely the theatre of IGP but frequently of interspecific predation. This is confirmed by experimental assessment of the cost of attacking and eating intraguild prey instead of extraguild in ladybird beetles.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2011.01626.x,0
560,The Behavioral Type of a Top Predator Drives the Short-Term Dynamic of Intraguild Predation,"Variation in behavior among individual top predators (i.e., the behavioral type) can strongly shape pest suppression in intraguild predation (IGP). However, the effect of a top predator's behavioral type-namely, foraging aggressiveness (number of killed divided by prey time) and prey choosiness (preference degree for certain prey type)-on the dynamic of IGP may interact with the relative abundances of top predator, mesopredator, and pest. We investigated the influence of the top predator's behavioral type on the dynamic of IGP in a three-species system with a top predator spider, a mesopredator spider, and a psyllid pest using a simulation model. The model parameters were estimated from laboratory experiments and field observations. The top predator's behavioral type altered the food-web dynamics in a context-dependent manner. The system with an aggressive/nonchoosy top predator, without prey preferences between pest and mesopredator, suppressed the pest more when the top predator to mesopredator abundance ratio was high. In contrast, the system with a timid/choosy top predator that preferred the pest to the mesopredator was more effective when the ratio was low. Our results show that the behavioral types and abundances of interacting species need to be considered together when studying food-web dynamics, because they evidently interact. To improve biocontrol efficiency of predators, research on the alteration of their behavioral types is needed.",https://doi.org/10.1086/690501,0
561,"Prey, predators, parasites: intraguild predation or simpler community modules in disguise?","1. Competition and predation are at the heart of community ecology. The theoretical concept of intraguild predation (IGP) combines these key interactions in a single community module. Because IGP is believed to be ubiquitous in nature, it has been subject to extensive research, and there exists a well-developed theoretical framework. 2. We show that a general class of IGP models can be transformed to simpler, but equivalent community structures. This rather unexpected simplification depends critically on the property of 'indiscriminate predation', which we define broadly as the top-predator not distinguishing between its two different prey species. 3. In a broader context, the great importance of IGP and of the simplifying transformation we report here is enhanced by the recent insight that the basic IGP structure extends naturally to host–parasitoid and host–pathogen communities. We show that parasites infecting prey (predators) tend to render IGP effectively into exploitative competition (tritrophic food chain, respectively). 4. The equivalence between the original and simplified community module makes it possible to take advantage from already existing insights. We illustrate this by means of an eco-epidemiological IGP model that is strikingly similar to a classical exploitative competition model. 5. The change of perspective on certain community modules may contribute to a better understanding of food web dynamics. In particular, it may help explain the interactions in food webs that include parasites. Given the ubiquity of parasitism, food webs may appear in a different light when they are transformed to their simplified analogue.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01788.x,0
562,Intraguild predation on the parasitoid Aphidius ervi by the generalist predator Harmonia axyridis: the threat and its avoidance,"Interactions between natural enemies can be crucial for determining their overall control of pest species, yet the mechanisms that govern such interactions are often poorly understood. The risk of negative effects such as intraguild predation and the possibility of mitigating such risks are important components for ultimately determining the compatibility of biological control agents. We performed a group of experiments to determine whether the coccinellid Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) poses an intraguild threat to the parasitoid Aphidius ervi Haliday (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and to see whether A. ervi is able to avoid predation by responding to the chemical tracks deposited by H. axyridis. We show that although H. axyridis does not readily consume A. ervi mummies, it preferentially consumes parasitized aphids over unparasitized aphids. We also show that A. ervi can defend against this threat by avoiding oviposition in the presence of H. axyridis chemical tracks. Aphidius ervi parasitized far fewer pea aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) on plants [Vicia faba L. (Fabaceae)] with H. axyridis chemical tracks in a no-choice environment at a single-plant scale. Similarly, when parasitoids could move freely between plants with and without tracks, A. ervi parasitism was higher on plants without tracks. Behavioral observations of A. ervi foraging suggested that this might be because of reduced A. ervi attack rates and patch residence times in the presence of H. axyridis tracks. Despite a risk of intraguild predation by H. axyridis, our study suggests that A. ervi may be able to mitigate this risk by altering its behavior in response to chemical cues.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2010.01090.x,0
563,Top predators and habitat complexity alter an intraguild predation module in pond communities,"Summary Predator diversity and habitat complexity frequently influence species interactions at lower trophic levels, yet their joint investigation has been performed infrequently despite the demonstrated importance of each individual factor. We investigated how different top predators and varying habitat complexity influence the function of an intraguild predation module consisting of two larval salamanders, intraguild predator Ambystoma annulatum and intraguild prey A. maculatum . We manipulated predator food webs and habitat complexity in outdoor mesocosms. Top predators significantly influenced body condition and survival of A. annulatum , but habitat complexity had minimal effects on either response. A three‐way interaction among the covariates top predator identity, habitat complexity and A. annulatum survival influenced body condition and survival of A. maculatum via a density‐mediated indirect effect. Different top predator combinations had variable effects in different habitat complexity treatments on intraguild predator ( A. annulatum ) survival that subsequently influenced intraguild prey ( A. maculatum ) body condition and survival. Future work should consider how different top predators influence other food web components, which should vary due to predator attributes and the physical environments in which they co‐occur.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12462,0
564,Escaping Intraguild Predation: Mexican Kit Foxes Survive While Coyotes and Golden Eagles Kill Canadian Swift Foxes,"Although interspecific killing among carnivores can drive populations toward extinction, it is generally unknown how these intraguild interactions vary among populations, and whether the threat for vulnerable species can be mitigated. We studied imperiled populations of swift foxes (Vulpes velox) in Canada and kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis) in Mexico to determine potential differences in survival or predator-avoidance strategies. Survival rates were significantly lower in Canada than in Mexico because of mortality caused by coyotes (Canis latrans) and golden eagles (Aquila chrysaëtos), and the potential for population recovery is likely higher for the Mexican fox population. Differences in body size between coyotes and foxes, diet, group sizes, intraspecific home-range overlap, home-range sizes of coyotes, and movements of coyotes relative to foxes were similar among study areas. However, Canadian foxes had home ranges that were approximately 3 times larger than those in Mexico, and Canadian foxes were most frequently killed on their home-range peripheries. Home ranges of kit foxes decreased in size as the availability of black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies increased and associated refuge holes, which foxes could use to escape predation, were significantly more abundant in Mexico than in Canada. Small home ranges of foxes probably reduced encounters with coyotes in Mexico, and a high availability of refuges likely allowed foxes to elude predators when such encounters did occur. Differences in survival of foxes relative to mortality caused by coyotes demonstrate that interactions between carnivores can -vary greatly between populations and that, in some situations, vulnerable species may be able to coexist with dominant carnivores despite a lack of large-scale habitat partitioning.",https://doi.org/10.1644/06-mamm-a-159r.1,0
565,"Intraguild predation leads to cascading effects on habitat choice, behaviour and reproductive performance","Summary Intraguild predation ( IGP ) is a commonly recognized mechanism influencing the community structure of predators, but the complex interactions are notoriously difficult to disentangle. The mesopredator suppression hypothesis predicts that a superpredator may either simultaneously repress two mesopredators, restrain the dominant one and thereby release the subdominant mesopredator, or elicit different responses by both mesopredators. We show the outcome arising from such conditions in a three‐level predator assemblage (Eurasian eagle owl Bubo bubo L., northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis L. and common buzzard Buteo buteo L.) studied over 25 years. In the second half of the study period, the eagle owl re‐colonized the study area, thereby providing a natural experiment of superpredator introduction. We combined this set‐up with detailed GIS analysis of habitat use and a field experiment simulating intrusion by the superpredator into territories of the subdominant mesopredator, the buzzard. Although population trends were positive for all three species in the assemblage, the proportion of failed breeding attempts increased significantly in both mesopredators after the superpredator re‐colonized the area. We predicted that superpredator‐induced niche shifts in the dominant mesopredator may facilitate mesopredator coexistence in superpredator‐free refugia. We found significant changes in nesting habitat choice in goshawk, but not in buzzard. Since competition for enemy‐free refugia and the rapid increase in population density may have constrained niche shifts of the subdominant mesopredator, we further predicted behavioural changes in response to the superpredator. The field experiment indeed showed a significant increase in aggressive response of buzzards towards eagle owl territory intrusion over the course of 10 years, probably due to phenotypic plasticity in the response towards superpredation risk. Overall, our results show that intraguild predation can be a powerful force of behavioural change, simultaneously influencing habitat use and aggressiveness in predator communities. These changes might help to buffer mesopredator populations against the negative effects of intraguild predation.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12493,0
566,Temporal dynamics of a simple community with intraguild predation: an experimental test,"We explore how adding complexity to a typical predator–prey interaction affects temporal dynamics. Intraguild predation webs contain competition, predation, and omnivory in a system of three species where theory and empirical results can be compared. We studied a planktonic microcosm community in which an alga is consumed by a flagellate and by a rotifer that also consumes the flagellate. Previously published theory predicts that phase lags between the species are the outcome of a “tug of war” among the intraguild‐predation links: rotifers↔algae, flagellates↔algae, and rotifers↔flagellates. We observed sustained oscilltions with abundance peaks that corresponded exactly to theoretical predictions in all replicates: peaks of the rotifers and flagellates fell on either side of a quarter‐period lag behind the prey (algae) peaks, with the peak of the intermediate predator (flagellates) preceding that of the top predator (rotifers). The phase lags in these experiments suggest that temporal variation in flagellate growth rate is primarily driven by variation in the intensity of its consumption by rotifers, rather than by variation in the density of its algal prey. This system illustrates how interaction strength affects the pattern of intraguild predation cycles and provides an opportunity to explore how evolution of interaction strength may affect those dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1890/12-0786.1,0
567,An acanthocephalan parasite mediates intraguild predation between invasive and native freshwater amphipods (Crustacea),"Summary 1. The balance of predation between closely related invasive and native species can be an important determinant of the success or failure of biological invasions. In Irish freshwaters, the introduced amphipod Gammarus pulex has replaced the native G. duebeni celticus , possibly through differential mutual intraguild predation (IGP). Theoretically, parasitism could mediate such predation and hence the invasion outcome. However, this idea remains poorly studied. 2. In a field survey, we show that the acanthocephalan parasite Echinorynchus truttae is present in more G. pulex populations than G. d. celticus populations. In addition, within parasitised populations, E. truttae is more prevalent in the invader than in the native. 3. We show for the first time that an acanthocephalan parasite mediates predation between its intermediate macroinvertebrate hosts. In a field experiment, E. truttae parasitism of the invader lowered IGP upon the unparasitised native. In laboratory experiments, parasitism of G. pulex significantly reduced their predatory impact on recently moulted female G. d. celticus . Parasitism also appeared to cause reduction in predatory behaviour, such as attacks per contact on precopula guarded female natives. 4. We conclude that higher parasite prevalence in invaders as compared with natives, by mediation of interspecific interactions, could promote species coexistence, or at least slow species replacements, in this particular biological invasion.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01145.x,0
568,Invasion success in communities with reciprocal intraguild predation depends on the stage structure of the resident population,"The probability of individuals being targeted as prey often decreases as they grow in size. Such size‐dependent predation risk is very common in systems with intraguild predation (IGP), i.e. when predatory species interact through predation and competition. Theory on IGP predicts that community composition depends on productivity. When recently testing this prediction using a terrestrial experimental system consisting of two phytoseiid mite species, Iphiseius degenerans as the IG‐predator and Neoseiulus cucumeris as the IG‐prey, and pollen ( Typha latifolia ) as the shared resource, we could not find the predicted community shift. Instead, we observed that IG‐prey excluded IG‐predators when the initial IG‐prey/IG‐predator ratio was high, whereas the opposite held when the initial ratio was low, which is also not predicted by theory. We therefore hypothesized that the existence of vulnerable and invulnerable stages in the two populations could be an important driver of the community composition. To test this, we first demonstrate that IG‐prey adults indeed attacked IG‐predator juveniles in the presence of the shared resource. Second, we show that the invasion capacity of IG‐predators at high productivity levels indeed depended on the structure of resident IG‐prey populations. Third, we further confirmed our hypothesis by mimicking successive invasion events of IG‐predators into an established population of IG‐prey at high productivity levels, which consistently failed. Our results show that the interplay between stage structure of populations and reciprocal intraguild predation is decisive at determining the species composition of communities with intraguild predation.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19369.x,0

In an effort to distinguish these two types of effects, during the summer of 1994 I compared abundances, patterns of microhabitat use, and diets of P. maniculatus on four areas of shrub-dominated prairie in north-central Colorado to these characteristics on four similar sites where O. leucogaster was removed. The abundance of P. maniculatus decreased during the study on both control and removal sites, but the decline was greater on controls, where numbers of O. leucogaster increased. Declines in the abundance of P. maniculatus on individual study plots were correlated with abundances and recolonization rates of O. leucogaster. Only 6% of P. maniculatus present on controls during pre-removal trapping were captured 7 wk later, compared to 32% of those initially present on removal sites. Furthermore, changes in the number of P. maniculatus were inversely related to the amount of shrub cover on sites, suggesting that shrubs may have provided refuge from O. leucogaster, which rarely uses these microhabitats. Analyses of microhabitat use support this assertion; individual P. maniculatus increased their use of shrubs on control sites when O. leucogaster was abundant, but there were no shifts in microhabitat use on removal sites. The proportions of arthropods in the diets of the two species were similar prior to Onychomys removals, and although P. maniculatus consumed fewer arthropods as the experiment progressed, diets did not differ between control and removal sites. In addition, Ord’s kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ordii) increased slightly in number following removals, and western harvest mice (Reithrodontomys megalotis) colonized two removal sites. These results suggest that predatory or aggressive interference by O. leucogaster, rather than exploitative competition, was responsible for the observed changes in abundance and microhabitat use. Risk of aggression or predatory interference therefore may influence the local abundance and distribution of P. maniculatus and other small rodents on areas of shortgrass prairie where habitat characteristics permit coexistence.",https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[1519:csospr]2.0.co;2,0
570,Feeding under high risk of intraguild predation: vigilance patterns of two medium-sized generalist predators,"To balance conflicting demands for food and safety from predation, foraging individuals trade off time between feeding and safety by vigilant behavior. We studied the behavior of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and pine martens (Martes martes) scavenging at carcasses of moose (Alces alces) killed by wolves (Canis lupus) in Sweden. Red foxes were observed visiting carcasses more often and at a higher frequency than pine martens, which restricted carcass use to certain habitats. Both species followed a similar daily and seasonal activity pattern. The seasonal peak of scavenging, in April for pine martens and April–May for red foxes, showed that remains of wolf-killed prey are likely an important food source for both of these species during reproduction. Pine martens displayed an overall higher level of vigilance and a lower level of feeding than red foxes. Vigilance by pine martens was affected by habitat, visibility, and vegetative cover at carcass sites. Pine martens did not display increased vigilance during time periods of high red fox activity and there was no effect of the time of day. Our study showed support for the importance of interspecific predation risk leading smaller predators to trade off foraging for increased vigilance, but habitat characteristics affected vigilance patterns more than the mere presence of a larger predator.",https://doi.org/10.1644/13-mamm-a-125,0
571,"Resource quality, resource availability, and intraguild predation among omnivorous mirids","Abstract Intraguild predation (IGP) among predatory species can influence many plant-arthropod associations. However, the relevance of IGP is poorly understood for truly omnivorous species such as those that can complete development on both animal and plant diets. Here we test the hypothesis that IGP among two omnivorous mirids is more common when extraguild food is either absent or not suitable. Laboratory experiments were performed in experimental cages in order to determine the effect of intraguild prey densities and diet availability on direction and intensity of IGP between Dicyphus tamaninii and Macrolophus caliginosus (Heteroptera: Miridae). Intraguild predation was symmetrical between the two mirid species in the absence of alternative food. Increasing densities of intraguild prey enhanced drastically the incidence of IGP. Intraguild predation was reduced when mirids were in the presence of green or red tomato fruits, but the presence of any other extraguild resources had no impact on IGP level. However, when given before the experiments, all resources with the exception of tomato leaves significantly reduced IGP. A second experiment was performed on live plants to compare the results of the previous trials with that obtained in a more natural setting. No IGP was observed when both mirid species were present on a plant. However, development of the intraguild prey (the more vulnerable stage) was hindered by the presence of the intraguild predator. The potential of such results is discussed from community ecology and biological control perspective.

572,Intraguild predation of the aphid pathogenic fungus <i>Pandora neoaphidis </i>by the invasive coccinellid <i>Harmonia axyridis</i>,"Abstract 1. The ladybird Harmonia axyridis is an invasive alien species in many countries and is predicted to have a negative impact on native biodiversity. However, little is known on the status of this aphidophage as an intraguild predator of natural enemies of aphids such as insect‐pathogenic fungi. 2. The study assessed the predation of the aphid‐specific pathogenic fungus Pandora neoaphidis by adult and larval H. axyridis collected from the U.K. (an invasive population) and Japan (a native population) relative to that of the ladybird Coccinella septempunctata (native to the U.K.) and the non‐U.K. C. septempunctata subspecies brucki that were either starved or unstarved. 3. Overall, predation of uninfected aphids was greater than infected aphids and, when given a choice, a preference for aphids was shown. However, the extent of this preference was dependent on the species and origin of the coccinellid. Harmonia axyridis (U.K.) consumed the greatest quantity of fungal cadavers and showed little preference for uninfected aphids over infected aphids. In contrast, C. septempunctata rarely consumed infected aphids. Life stage had no direct effects on predation but starved coccinellids consumed more uninfected aphids than infected aphids. 4. Harmonia axyridis (U.K.) is a stronger intraguild predator of P. neoaphidis cadavers than the native species C. septempunctata and, therefore, may have an impact on the occurrence and persistence of P. neoaphidis . The differences in intraguild predation by H. axyridis collected in the U.K. and those from Japan suggests that individuals that invaded the U.K. could have a different genetic profile to those in its native range.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2007.00954.x,0
573,Laboratory studies on intraguild predation and cannibalism among coccinellid larvae (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae),"Intraguild predation (IGP) and cannibalism occur in the field and could affect the dominance structure of guilds of coccinellid species. The exotic biological control agent Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is now well established in most areas of Northern and Central Italy, but it is unclear what effect this species could have on native dominant and non-dominant coccinellids with which it co-occurs. In order to predict the trophic interactions in coccinellid guilds and the likely effect of H. axyridis, the incidence of IGP and cannibalism among the following six species were evaluated under laboratory conditions: H. axyridis, three native dominant species, Adalia bipunctata (L.), Oenopia conglobata (L.) and Coccinella septempunctata L. and two native non-dominant species, Platynaspis luteorubra (Goeze) and Scymnus apetzi (Mulsant). Unfed and fed fourth instar larvae of the above species were paired in an experimental arena and the incidence of predation recorded over a period of 24 h. In absence of aphids, the survival probabilities (SP) of A. bipunctata and O. conglobata were lowest when paired with either C. septempunctata or H. axyridis (< 0.20 SP after 24 h). The SP of C. septempunctata was similar if paired with either a conspecific larva or H. axyridis (< 0.34 SP after 24 h) and that of H. axyridis was reduced similarly if paired with either a conspecific larva or C. septempunctata (> 0.71 SP after 24 h). The SP of P. luteorubra was lower when paired with A. bipunctata and C. septempunctata (< 0.07 SP after 24 h) than with other species and that of S. apetzi was greatly reduced when paired with all the dominant and exotic species (< 0.27 SP after 24h). In presence of aphids no predatory events occurred in most combinations. H. axyridis acted as a strong predator of native dominant and non-dominant coccinellids when the aphids are scarce. We did not find any evidence, however, that the incidence of IGP among exotic and native species is higher than either IGP or cannibalism in native species. The likelihood of IGP occurring in the field is discussed.",https://doi.org/10.14411/eje.2012.046,0
574,"Intraguild predation, thermoregulation, and microhabitat selection by snakes","Intraguild (IG) predation, the killing and eating of potential competitors, can be a powerful force within faunal assemblages.If both the IG predator and its prey prefer similar microhabitats in spatially structured environments, avoidance of the predator may relegate IG prey to suboptimal habitats.In southeastern Australia, the broad-headed snake (Hoplocephalus bungaroides) is an endangered species sympatric with the small-eyed snake (Cryptophis nigrescens), an abundant and geographically widespread species known to eat other snakes.Both of these nocturnal ectotherms shelter diurnally beneath thermally distinctive ''hot rocks,'' which are in limited supply.When selecting shelter sites, broad-headed snakes thus face a trade-off between predation risk and habitat quality.In laboratory experiments, we allowed broad-headed snakes to choose between retreat sites differing in thermal regimes, in scent cues from predators, and in the actual presence of the predator.Broad-headed snakes displayed an aversion to sites with live predators and predator scent, yet nonetheless frequently selected those sites to obtain thermal benefits.In trials with live predators, adult broad-headed snakes shared hot rocks with small-eyed snakes, but most juveniles did not; data from a 16-year field study likewise suggest that broad-headed snakes only cohabit with small-eyed snakes if the two snakes are similar in body size.Our results suggest that thermoregulatory considerations are sufficient to prompt juvenile (but not adult) broad-headed snakes to risk IG predation, emphasizing the importance of microhabitat quality and body size in mediating IG predator-prey interactions.",https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arp011,0
575,Competition and Intraguild Predation Among Three Species of Coccinellids (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae),"Abstract The establishment of exotic coccinellid species may be related to the decline in native coccinellid species within the United States. Coccinellids may interact indirectly by competing for shared resources and directly through intraguild predation. Prior studies have examined pairwise interactions among species and although several coccinellid species typically co-exist within habitats, multi-species interactions have rarely been investigated. To examine how aphid prey levels influence interspecific interactions among a multispecies assemblage, the exotic coccinellids, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) and Coccinella septempunctata (L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and a native coccinellid species, Coleomegilla maculata (DeGeer) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), were paired or placed in groups containing three heterospecific larvae and fed 2.4, 12.0, or 24.0 mg of aphids per larva daily. Larval survival, developmental time, and adult weight of individuals were measured. Greater amounts of prey typically resulted in increased adult weights and shorter developmental times. When Coleomegilla maculata and Coccinella septempunctata were paired, Coleomegilla maculata had higher survival rates at low prey levels and Coccinella septempunctata had higher survival at mid- and high prey levels. When the three species were combined, Coccinella septempunctata and Coleomegilla maculata had similar survival rates (17%) at low prey levels; at mid- and high prey levels, Coccinella septempunctata survival increased (58–88%), but Coleomegilla maculata survival remained similar (17–21%). Survival of H. axyridis was not affected by competitors. Even though intraguild predation occurs among these species, the responses to competitors varied based on prey level, coccinellid species, and the number of interacting larvae.",https://doi.org/10.1603/008.102.0310,0
576,The food web in a subterranean ecosystem is driven by intraguild predation,"Abstract Trophic interactions of cave arthropods have been understudied. We used molecular methods (NGS) to decipher the food web in the subterranean ecosystem of the Ardovská Cave (Western Carpathians, Slovakia). We collected five arthropod predators of the species Parasitus loricatus (gamasid mites), Eukoenenia spelaea (palpigrades), Quedius mesomelinus (beetles), and Porrhomma profundum and Centromerus cavernarum (both spiders) and prey belonging to several orders. Various arthropod orders were exploited as prey, and trophic interactions differed among the predators. Linear models were used to compare absolute and relative prey body sizes among the predators. Quedius exploited relatively small prey, while Eukoenenia and Parasitus fed on relatively large prey. Exploitation of eggs or cadavers is discussed. In contrast to previous studies, Eukoenenia was found to be carnivorous. A high proportion of intraguild predation was found in all predators. Intraspecific consumption (most likely cannibalism) was detected only in mites and beetles. Using Pianka’s index, the highest trophic niche overlaps were found between Porrhomma and Parasitus and between Centromerus and Eukoenenia , while the lowest niche overlap was found between Parasitus and Quedius . Contrary to what we expected, the high availability of Diptera and Isopoda as a potential prey in the studied system was not corroborated. Our work demonstrates that intraguild diet plays an important role in predators occupying subterranean ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-84521-1,0
577,The dynamics of intraguild predation in Chrysomya albiceps Wied. (Diptera: Calliphoridae): interactions between instars and species under different abundances of food,"The pattern of larval interaction in blowflies confined with Chrysomya albiceps Wied. and C. rufifacies Maquart can be changed in response to the predatory behaviour of the two species to a contest-type process instead of the scramble competition that usually occurs in blowflies. Facultative predation is a frequent behaviour in C. albiceps and C. rufifacies that occurs as an alternative food source during the larval stage. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of intraguild predation by C. albiceps on other fly species in order to analyse interspecific and intraspecific survival in C. albiceps, C. megacephala and C. macellaria Fabricius. The experimental design of the study allowed us to evaluate how factors such as species, density and abundance of food influenced the survival of the calliphorid species. When C. albiceps was confined with C. megacephala or C. macellaria, only adults of C. albiceps survived at different larval densities and abundance of food. In addition, the survival of C. albiceps was higher in two-species experiments when compared to single species experiments. The implications of these results for the dynamics of C. albiceps were discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1590/s1519-566x2006000600009,0
578,Intraguild Predation Behaviour of Ladybirds in Semi-Field Experiments Explains Invasion Success of Harmonia axyridis,"Harmonia axyridis has been introduced as a biological control agent in Europe and the USA. Since its introduction, it has established and spread, and it is now regarded as an invasive alien species. It has been suggested that intraguild predation is especially important for the invasion success of H. axyridis. The aim of this study was to compare the intraguild predation behaviour of three ladybird species (Coccinella septempunctata, Adalia bipunctata, and H. axyridis). Predation behaviour was investigated in semi-field experiments on small lime trees (Tilia platyphyllos). Two fourth-instar larvae placed on a tree rarely made contact during 3-hour observations. When placed together on a single leaf in 23%–43% of the observations at least one contact was made. Of those contacts 0%–27% resulted in an attack. Harmonia axyridis attacked mostly heterospecifics, while A. bipunctata and C. septempunctata attacked heterospecifics as often as conspecifics. In comparison with A. bipunctata and C. septempunctata, H. axyridis was the most successful intraguild predator as it won 86% and 44% of heterospecific battles against A. bipunctata and C. septempunctata respectively, whilst A. bipunctata won none of the heterospecific battles and C. septempunctata won only the heterospecific battles against A. bipunctata. Coccinella septempunctata dropped from a leaf earlier and more often than the other two species but was in some cases able to return to the tree, especially under cloudy conditions. The frequency with which a species dropped did not depend on the species the larva was paired with. The results of these semi-field experiments confirm that H. axyridis is a strong intraguild predator as a consequence of its aggressiveness and good defence against predation from heterospecific species. The fact that H. axyridis is such a strong intraguild predator helps to explain its successful establishment as invasive alien species in Europe and the USA.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0040681,0
579,Evaluating the effects of trophic complexity on a keystone predator by disassembling a partial intraguild predation food web,"Summary 1. Many taxa can be found in food webs that differ in trophic complexity, but it is unclear how trophic complexity affects the performance of particular taxa. In pond food webs, larvae of the salamander Ambystoma opacum occupy the intermediate predator trophic position in a partial intraguild predation (IGP) food web and can function as keystone predators. Larval A. opacum are also found in simpler food webs lacking either top predators or shared prey. 2. We conducted an experiment where a partial IGP food web was simplified, and we measured the growth and survival of larval A. opacum in each set of food webs. Partial IGP food webs that had either a low abundance or high abundance of total prey were also simplified by independently removing top predators and/or shared prey. 3. Removing top predators always increased A. opacum survival, but removal of shared prey had no effect on A. opacum survival, regardless of total prey abundance. 4. Surprisingly, food web simplification had no effect on the growth of A. opacum when present in food webs with a low abundance of prey but had important effects on A. opacum growth in food webs with a high abundance of prey. Simplifying a partial IGP food web with a high abundance of prey reduced A. opacum growth when either top predators or shared prey were removed from the food web and the loss of top predators and shared prey influenced A. opacum growth in a non‐additive fashion. 5. The non‐additive response in A. opacum growth appears to be the result of supplemental prey availability augmenting the beneficial effects of top predators. Top predators had a beneficial effect on A. opacum populations by reducing the abundance of A. opacum present and thereby reducing the intensity of intraspecific competition. 6. Our study indicates that the effects of food web simplification on the performance of A. opacum are complex and depend on both how a partial IGP food web is simplified and how abundant prey are in the food web. These findings are important because they demonstrate how trophic complexity can create variation in the performance of intermediate predators that play important roles in temporary pond food webs.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01906.x,0
580,Stable isotope analyses document intraguild predation in wolf spiders (Araneae: Lycosidae) and underline beneficial effects of alternative prey and microhabitat structure on intraguild prey survival,"Intraguild predation (IGP) is common among generalist predators and an important issue in food web theory, because IGP may destabilise communities by increasing extinction of species. Also, IGP may interfere with the effectiveness of generalist predators as biological control agents. In general, occurrence of IGP in laboratory or field studies is inferred from abundance data or direct observations only. We investigated if tracing stable isotopes allows distinction between different types of predation and confirmation of IGP. Wolf spiders were chosen as model organisms for generalist predators; IGP of third instar A. cuneata on second instar P. palustris was investigated in a laboratory experiment. The availability of alternative prey and the complexity of the microhabitat were manipulated, since both factors are thought to facilitate coexistence of predators. Stable isotope analysis documented predation of A. cuneata on P. palustris and predation on alternative prey by both juveniles. Both the presence of alternative prey and the availability of shelter reduced mortality of juvenile P. palustris during the first week. During the second week mortality increased in complex structure without alternative prey presumably due to enhanced activity and cannibalism among starving P. palustris . Thus, microhabitat complexity and prey abundance may foster coexistence of wolf spiders in the field. In conclusion, stable isotope analysis was proven a powerful tool to investigate animal behaviour without direct observation. The method allowed disentangling predator feeding behaviour when more than one type of prey was present.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14421.x,0
581,Intraguild predation among ladybeetles and a green lacewing: do the larval spines of <i>Curinus coeruleus</i>(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) serve a defensive function?,"Abstract Laboratory experiments examined interspecific interactions between larvae of three coccinellid species, Curinus coeruleus Mulsant (Chilocorinae), Harmonia axyridis Pallas and Olla v-nigrum (Mulsant) (Coccinellinae), and between these and larvae of the green lacewing, Chrysoperla rufilabris (Burmeister). Larvae of C. coeruleus , although defended on their dorsal surface with long spines, had the smallest mandibles, were the slowest-moving, and the least successful in interspecific larval combat. The long spines of third instar C. coeruleus appeared to reduce their palatability as food to H. axyridis and O. v-nigrum larvae in choice tests with dead larvae, but were not an effective defence against these species in Petri dish arenas. Larvae of O. v-nigrum had a smooth dorsal surface, were intermediate in terms of mandible size, but were the fastest moving, a trait that benefited their survival in intraguild combat. Larvae of H. axyridis were intermediate with respect to dorsal spines and speed of movement, but had the largest mandibles. This species was the most effective intraguild combatant among the coccinellids and the only one to successfully compete against C. rufilabris larvae of similar age. The speed, manoeuverability and long mandibles of C. rufilabris enabled them to impale coccinellid larvae at a relatively safe distance. The spines of C. coeruleus larvae impeded laterally oriented attacks by C. rufilabris , but did not provide sustained protection from repeated attacks. Success in these interactions appeared largely a function of offensive weaponry (mandible size and morphology) and speed of movement, although the role of dorsal spines as defensive structures was not ruled out. Rates of larval cannibalism were highest for C. rufilabris and largely mirrored the level of aggression observed in interspecific combat for each species.",https://doi.org/10.1079/ber2003269,0
582,Influence of predator-specific defense adaptation on intraguild predation,"The persistence of intraguild predation (IGP), the prey–predator interaction between competing species, is puzzling because simple IGP models readily predict species extinction. In this study, we explored a mathematical model incorporating predator-specific defense adaptation of basal prey against intraguild prey and intraguild predator. The model explicitly described the dynamics of the defense effort against each predator under the assumption that anti-predator defense was associated with reducing effort allocated to reproduction. The model predicted that defense adaptation (i.e. the ability to reallocate defense effort) would facilitate coexistence, particularly when system productivity is high; at low productivity, coexistence would be facilitated or inhibited depending on initial effort allocation prior to defense adaptation. In addition, we found that three-species dynamics became more stable at higher adaptation rates. The results suggest that common behavioral changes, such as predator-specific defense adaptation, have significant implications for the community structure and dynamics of IGP systems.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.17953.x,0
583,Intraguild predation leads to genetically based character shifts in the threespine stickleback,"Intraguild predation is a common ecological interaction that occurs when a species preys upon another species with which it competes. The interaction is potentially a mechanism of divergence between intraguild prey (IG-prey) populations, but it is unknown if cases of character shifts in IG-prey are an environmental or evolutionary response. We investigated the genetic basis and inducibility of character shifts in threespine stickleback from lakes with and without prickly sculpin, a benthic intraguild predator (IG-predator). Wild populations of stickleback sympatric with sculpin repeatedly show greater defensive armor and water column height preference. We laboratory-raised stickleback from lakes with and without sculpin, as well as marine stickleback, and found that differences between populations in armor, body shape, and behavior persisted in a common garden. Within the common garden, we raised stickleback half-families from multiple populations in the presence and absence of sculpin. Although the presence of sculpin induced trait changes in the marine stickleback, we did not observe an induced response in the freshwater stickleback. Behavioral and morphological trait differences between freshwater populations thus have a genetic basis and suggest an evolutionary response to intraguild predation.",https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.12811,0
584,Analysis of adaptive foraging in an intraguild predation system,"Abstract. An intraguild predation (IGP) system with adaptive foraging behavior was analyzed using a simple mathematical model. The main aim was to explore how the adaptive behavior affects species interactions as well as how such interactions derived from adaptive behavior affect community stability. The focal system contained top predators, intermediate predators, and basal prey. Intermediate predators exhibit antipredator behavior and balance costs (e.g. perceived predation risk) and benefits (e.g. resource intake) to determine their foraging effort. Density-dependent foraging behavior with the unique connectance of the IGP food web created unusual species interactions. Notably, increased prey density can transmit negative indirect effects to top predators while increased top predator density transmits positive indirect effects to prey population. The nature of these interactions is density-dependent. The results suggest that both IGP (as opposed to linear food chain) and adaptive foraging behaviors may strongly influence community dynamics due to emergent interactions among direct effects and indirect effects. Furthermore, the adaptive foraging of intermediate predators may stabilize the community as a whole.",https://doi.org/10.5194/we-4-1-2003,0
585,"Role of surface chemicals in egg cannibalism and intraguild predation by neonates of two aphidophagous ladybirds, <i>Propylea dissecta</i> and <i>Coccinella transversalis</i>","Abstract: The role of surface chemicals in egg cannibalism and intraguild predation by neonates of two aphidophagous ladybirds, Propylea dissecta and Coccinella transversalis were examined. Neonates of both species prefer to eat non‐sibling conspecific eggs than heterospecific eggs, with higher preference in P. dissecta . Surface chemicals appear to play a major role for the preference of conspecific eggs, as the ladybird behaviour was reversed when these chemicals were interchanged. The surface chemicals present on the eggs possibly act as feeding stimulants to conspecific neonates but not for heterospecific neonates. Egg clustering enhances the effect of surface chemical and stimulate non‐sibling egg cannibalism and appears to reduce intraguild predation. Egg clustering is advantageous to ladybirds, as it can stimulate non‐sibling cannibalism by neonates. It appears that aggregation of chemicals present on the conspecific egg surface possibly attracts the hungry conspecific neonate, providing the first meal for its survival, while protecting against heterospecific predators. Neonates of both ladybirds were reluctant to eat heterospecific eggs.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2004.00913.x,0
586,Effects of Intraguild Predation: Evaluating Resource Competition between Two Canid Species with Apparent Niche Separation,"Many studies determine which habitat components are important to animals and the extent their use may overlap with competitive species. However, such studies are often undertaken after populations are in decline or under interspecific stress. Since habitat selection is not independent of interspecific stress, quantifying an animal's current landscape use could be misleading if the species distribution is suboptimal. We present an alternative approach by modeling the predicted distributions of two sympatric species on the landscape using dietary preferences and prey distribution. We compared the observed habitat use of kit foxes ( Vulpes macrotis ) and coyotes ( Canis latrans ) against their predicted distribution. Data included locations of kit foxes and coyotes, carnivore scat transects, and seasonal prey surveys. Although habitats demonstrated heterogeneity with respect to prey resources, only coyotes showed habitat use designed to maximize access to prey. In contrast, kit foxes used habitats which did not align closely with prey resources. Instead, habitat use by kit foxes represented spatial and behavioral strategies designed to minimize spatial overlap with coyotes while maximizing access to resources. Data on the distribution of prey, their dietary importance, and the species-specific disparities between predicted and observed habitat distributions supports a mechanism by which kit fox distribution is derived from intense competitive interactions with coyotes.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/629246,0
587,Temporal shifts in intraguild predation pressure between beluga whales and Greenland halibut in a changing Arctic,"Asymmetrical intraguild predation (AIGP), which combines both predation and competition between predator species, is pervasive in nature with relative strengths varying by prey availability. But with species redistributions associated with climate change, the response by endemic predators within an AIGP context to changing biotic-abiotic conditions over time (i.e. seasonal and decadal) has yet to be quantified. Furthermore, little is known on AIGP dynamics in ecosystems undergoing rapid directional change such as the Arctic. Here, we investigate the flexibility of AIGP among two predators in the same trophic guild: beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), by season and over 30 years in Cumberland Sound-a system where forage fish capelin (Mallotus villosus) have recently become more available. Using stable isotopes, we illustrate different predator responses to temporal shifts in forage fish availability. On a seasonal cycle, beluga consumed less Greenland halibut and increased consumption of forage fish during summer, contrasting a constant consumption rate of forage fish by Greenland halibut year-round leading to decreased AIGP pressure between predators. Over a decadal scale (1982-2012), annual consumption of forage fish by beluga increased with a concomitant decline in the consumption of Greenland halibut, thereby indicating decreased AIGP pressure between predators in concordance with increased forage fish availability. The long-term changes of AIGP pressure between endemic predators illustrated here highlights climate-driven environmental alterations to interspecific intraguild interactions in the Arctic.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2017.0433,0
588,Temperature dependency of intraguild predation between native and invasive crabs,"Environmental factors such as temperature can affect the geographical distribution of species directly by exceeding physiological tolerances, or indirectly by altering physiological rates that dictate the sign and strength of species interactions. Although the direct effects of environmental conditions are relatively well studied, the effects of environmentally mediated species interactions have garnered less attention. In this study, we examined the temperature dependency of size-structured intraguild predation (IGP) between native blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus, the IG predator) and invasive green crabs (Carcinus maenas, the IG prey) to evaluate how the effect of temperature on competitive and predatory rates may influence the latitudinal distribution of these species. In outdoor mesocosm experiments, we quantified interactions between blue crabs, green crabs, and shared prey (mussels) at three temperatures reflective of those across their range, using two size classes of blue crab. At low temperatures, green crabs had a competitive advantage and IGP by blue crabs on green crabs was low. At high temperatures, size-matched blue and green crabs were competitively similar, large blue crabs had a competitive advantage, and IGP on green crabs was high. We then used parameter values generated from these experiments (temperature- and size-dependent attack rates and handling times) in a size-structured IGP model in which we varied IGP attack rate, maturation rate of the blue crab from the non-predatory to predatory size class, and resource carrying capacity at each of the three temperatures. In the model, green crabs were likely to competitively exclude blue crabs at low temperature, whereas blue crabs were likely to competitively and consumptively exclude green crabs at higher temperatures, particularly when resource productivities and rates of IGP were high. While many factors may play a role in delimiting species ranges, our results suggest that temperature-dependent interactions can influence local coexistence and are worth considering when developing mechanistic species distribution models and evaluating responses to environmental change.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2157,0
589,Size-structured cannibalism between top predators promotes the survival of intermediate predators in an intraguild predation system,"Individuals in most natural populations of predators vary in size, and size differences among individuals often result in cannibalism. Cannibalism is an extremely common phenomenon in the animal kingdom, particularly among generalist predators that engage in intraguild predation (IGP). However, few studies have specifically addressed the effects of cannibalism on IGP. The aim of my study was to investigate how trophic and behavioral interactions between 2 size classes of an intraguild (IG) predator influenced the survival and behavior of IG prey and a shared prey resource. I tested for these effects with larval odonates by exposing a shared prey resource (Ischnura verticalis) to the presence or absence of IG prey (Pachydiplax longipennis) and 2 size classes of IG predators (small or large Anax junius) in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design. Mortality rates of the shared resource in all single-predator treatments were significantly greater than in nonpredator controls, and risk reduction was observed when the shared resource was exposed to combinations of predators. The significant negative effect of large A. junius on P. longipennis survival and activity level was greater than that of small A. junius. Cannibalism occurred between large and small A. junius in size-structured IG predator treatments, and the effects of the size classes were not additive for the survival of IG prey. Cannibalism was not solely responsible for risk reduction in IG prey, and reduced activity level of small A. junius in the presence of larger conspecifics probably had a positive influence on P. longipennis survival. My results demonstrate that cannibalism among IG predators can influence the survival of IG prey and might contribute to coexistence among predators in systems with strong IGP.",https://doi.org/10.1899/09-006.1,0
590,"Cannibalism and intraguild predation in the phytoseiid mites Typhlodromips swirskii, Euseius scutalis and Typhlodromus athiasae (Acari: Phytoseiidae).","The intraguild predation and cannibalism on eggs and immatures by the adult females of Euseius scutalis, Typhlo- dromus athiasae and Typhlodromips swirskii were examined under laboratory conditions. Adult females of all three species exhib- ited higher predation rates on larvae than on protonymphs. Typhlodromips swirskii had higher predation rates on heterospecific than on conspecific prey and all females failed to predate on eggs and protonymphs of its own. Also, T. swirskii females were able to sustain oviposition when preying upon eggs and immatures of T. athiasae and E. scutalis, whereas cannibalizing T. swirskii females did not lay eggs and all died in a short time (6.0-7.3 days), respectively. Typhlodromus athiasae failed to predate on eggs as well as immatures of T. swirskii and females suffered a higher mortality than vice versa. Euseius scutalis females ate 6.0 larvae or 5.2 protonymphs of T. athiasae and 0.7 eggs or 0.4 larvae of T. swirskii per female per day. Females of E. scutalis were hardly able to sustain oviposition irrespective of con- or heterospecific prey, so reproduction was very low. The present study indicates that phytoseiid immatures are suitable prey for surviving and reproduction of polyphagous phytoseiids.",,0
591,"The Quality of Nonprey Food Affects Cannibalism, Intraguild Predation, and Hyperpredation in Two Species of Phytoseiid Mites","Generalist arthropod predators not only prey on herbivores but also may engage in competitive interactions by attacking and consuming conspecifics (cannibalism) or other predators (intraguild predation [IGP] and hyperpredation). These types of interactions are quite common among predators used in biological control. Although there is evidence that nonprey food relaxes cannibalism and IGP, there is little information regarding the impact of the quality of the nonprey food. Herein, we examined how pollen of different nutritional quality (pine, narrow-leaf cattail, or apple) impacted 1) the cannibalism by females of Euseius stipulatus (Athias-Henriot) (Acari: Phytoseiidae) on conspecific larvae, 2) the reciprocal predation between gravid females of E. stipulatus or Iphiseius degenerans (Berlese) (Acari: Phytoseiidae) and heterospecific larvae, and 3) the predation of E. stipulatus on the eggs of the aphid predator Aphidoletes aphidimyza (Rondani) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae). E. stipulatus cannibalism was significantly reduced in the cattail pollen treatment, whereas in the pine pollen it did not significantly differ from control (no food). Predation between I. degenerans and E. stipulatus was significantly reduced in the cattail pollen treatment as compared to the control treatment. Finally, predation of E. stipulatus on A. aphidimyza eggs was significantly reduced when cattail or apple pollen was provided compared to the pine pollen or control treatments. These results suggest that cattail or apple pollen is suitable for mitigating negative interactions among generalist predatory mites used in biological control.",https://doi.org/10.1093/jee/tox301,0
592,Biodiversity Loss following the Introduction of Exotic Competitors: Does Intraguild Predation Explain the Decline of Native Lady Beetles?,"Exotic species are widely accepted as a leading cause of biodiversity decline. Lady beetles (Coccinellidae) provide an important model to study how competitor introductions impact native communities since several native coccinellids have experienced declines that coincide with the establishment and spread of exotic coccinellids. This study tested the central hypothesis that intraguild predation by exotic species has caused these declines. Using sentinel egg experiments, we quantified the extent of predation on previously-common (Hippodamia convergens) and common (Coleomegilla maculata) native coccinellid eggs versus exotic coccinellid (Harmonia axyridis) eggs in three habitats: semi-natural grassland, alfalfa, and soybean. Following the experiments quantifying egg predation, we used video surveillance to determine the composition of the predator community attacking the eggs. The extent of predation varied across habitats, and egg species. Native coccinellids often sustained greater egg predation than H. axyridis. We found no evidence that exotic coccinellids consumed coccinellid eggs in the field. Harvestmen and slugs were responsible for the greatest proportion of attacks. This research challenges the widely-accepted hypothesis that intraguild predation by exotic competitors explains the loss of native coccinellids. Although exotic coccinellids may not be a direct competitor, reduced egg predation could indirectly confer a competitive advantage to these species. A lower proportion of H. axyridis eggs removed by predators may have aided its expansion and population increase and could indirectly affect native species via exploitative or apparent competition. These results do not support the intraguild predation hypothesis for native coccinellid decline, but do bring to light the existence of complex interactions between coccinellids and the guild of generalist predators in coccinellid foraging habitats.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0084448,0
593,"A species invasion mediated through habitat structure, intraguild predation, and parasitism","With field, laboratory, and modeling approaches, we examined the interplay among habitat structure, intraguild predation (IGP), and parasitism in an ongoing species invasion. Native Gammarus duebeni celticus (Crustacea: Amphipoda) are often, but not always, replaced by the invader Gammarus pulex through differential IGP. The muscle‐wasting microsporidian parasite Pleistophora mulleri infects the native but not the invader. We found a highly variable prevalence of P. mulleri in uninvaded rivers, with 0–91% of hosts parasitized per sample. In addition, unparasitized natives dominated fast‐flowing riffle patches of river, whereas parasitized individuals dominated slower‐flowing, pooled patches. We examined the survivorship of invader and native in single and mixed‐species microcosms with high, intermediate, and zero parasite prevalence. G. pulex survivorship was high in all treatments, whereas G. duebeni subsp. celticus survivorship was significantly lower in the presence of the invader. Further, parasitized G. duebeni subsp. celticus experienced near‐total elimination. Models of the species replacement process implied that parasite‐enhanced IGP would make invasion by G. pulex more likely, regardless of habitat and parasite spatial structure. However, where heterogeneity in parasite prevalence creates a landscape of patches with different susceptibilities to invasion, G. pulex may succeed in cases where invasion would not be possible if patches were equivalent. The different responses of parasitized and unparasitized G. duebeni subsp. celticus to environmental heterogeneity potentially link landscape patterns to the success or failure of the invasion process.",https://doi.org/10.4319/lo.2004.49.5.1848,0
594,Social Interactions between Two Owl Species Sometimes Associated with Intraguild Predation,"Species may act simultaneously as competitor and predator for other species at the same trophic level. This is known as Intraguild Predation (IGP). Most research on this topic describes the final steps of this phenomenon, when one species suffers lost progeny or decreased numbers due to predation and competition by another species. However, little is known about the mechanism that regulates this interaction in previous steps. In this work two species of the same guild (Little Owl Athene noctua and Barn Owl Tyto alba) were selected to test the hypothesis that the hunting and social behaviour of the Little Owl would be conditioned by the presence of Barn Owls. Nine Little Owls were radio-tracked and monitored for nine months. 1223 fixes were obtained and 250 hours of listening were recorded. Moreover, during this time Barn Owls were detected 66 times screeching, hunting or flying in the same areas as the monitored Little Owls. The subsequent activity (movements and voices) of tagged and untagged Little Owls was observed during 30-minute periods. The results show that Little Owl behaviour was affected by Barn Owl presence. When Little Owls noted the presence of Barn Owls, they stayed quiet and silent, or alternatively, sought refuge in the branches of trees or in secure holes in buildings, resuming their activities minutes later, when the risk of predation was presumably lower. This behaviour may have enabled survival and successful breeding of Little Owl in close proximity to Barn Owls.",https://doi.org/10.5253/078.096.0112,0
595,"Intraguild predation, activity patterns, growth and longitudinal distribution in running water odonate larvae","I studied predation by larval Cordulegaster boltonii on larvae of two other dragonfly species in a laboratory artificial stream. Onychogomphus forcipatus unguiculatus suffered significantly higher predation than Onychogomphus uncatus. Activity was much lower in O. uncatus, which is interpreted as an antipredation trait against C. boltonii. The higher activity of O. f. unguiculatus makes it vulnerable to the sit-and-wait predator C. boltonii due to increased encounters. Rearing of both Onychogomphus in field cages under the same conditions of temperature, food availability and density revealed lower growth rates of O. uncatus, which may be interpreted as a cost of the antipredation behaviour. To test whether experimental results have relevance for largescale distribution patterns of the two Onychogomphus, samples were taken at 23 sites in river-systems of southern France where both species co-occur. In the field I found that O. f. unguiculatus does not coexist with C. boltonii at sites where the latter occurs in high numbers. In contrast, O. uncatus is established even at high density of C. boltonii.",https://doi.org/10.1127/archiv-hydrobiol/151/2001/1,0
596,Facultative Intraguild Predation of Red Oak Borer Larvae (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae): Fig. 1.,"In the Ozark National forests of Arkansas and Missouri, an outbreak of a native cerambycid beetle, the red oak borer, Enaphalodes rufulus (Haldeman), seems responsible for widespread oak mortality. The underlying reasons for this outbreak are being studied. Historically, a small portion of within-tree red oak borer mortality has been attributed to natural enemies (woodpeckers and nitidulid larvae), but the majority of mortality is from unknown factors. In four experiments, phloem sandwiches were used to observe inter- and intraspecific predation on red oak borer larvae. Our studies revealed that red oak borer was cannibalistic and that this behavior resulted in statistically significant weight gain. Observations were also made on predaceous behavior by associated insect larvae, specifically carpenterworms, elaterids, and nitidulids. We found that carpenterworms and elaterids will eat red oak borer larvae, but nitidulids exhibited no predaceous behavior. These observed behaviors may have important implications for red oak borer population dynamics because they identify potential mortality factors to red oak borer larvae.",https://doi.org/10.1603/0046-225x-35.2.443,0
597,Impact of plant architecture and extraguild prey density on intraguild predation in an agroecosystem,"Abstract Several models and experimental studies conducted in confined environments have shown that intraguild predation ( IGP ) can modulate population abundances and structure communities. A number of ecological and abiotic factors determine the nature and frequency of IGP . This study examined the effect of plant architecture and extraguild prey density, and their interactions, on the occurrence of IGP between two species of ladybird, H armonia axyridis ( P allas) and P ropylea quatuordecimpunctata L . (both C oleoptera: C occinellidae). Theoretical concepts predict that IGP levels would increase with a decrease of both extraguild prey density and plant structural complexity. We conducted a factorial experiment in an open soybean field into which coccinellid larvae were introduced in experimental plots for a period of 5 days. We tested two levels of soybean aphid [ A phis glycines M atsumara ( H emiptera: A phididae)] density, low and high (100 and 1 000 aphids per plot, respectively), and two levels of plant complexity, low (by removing half of the branches from the soybean plants) and high (by leaving plants intact). We used species‐specific molecular markers to detect the presence of P . quatuordecimpunctata in the digestive tract of H . axyridis . Molecular gut‐content analysis of H . axyridis revealed that rates of IGP were higher (20%) at low aphid density than at high aphid density (&lt;6%). Decreased plant complexity did not impact the frequency of IGP . In accordance with existing literature, this study demonstrates that IGP is amplified at low extraguild prey density. We conclude that considering environmental factors, such as extraguild prey density, is crucial to improve our ability to predict the impact of intraguild predation on community structure and, from an applied perspective, biological control.",https://doi.org/10.1111/eea.12213,0
598,Intraguild Predation between Lady Beetles and Lacewings: Outcomes and Consequences Vary with Focal Prey and Arena of Interaction,"Abstract We examined reciprocal intraguild predation (IGP) and cannibalism among various combinations of Coleomegilla maculata DeGeer and Chrysoperla cornea Stephens larvae as they developed feeding on greenbugs, Schizaphis graminum Rondani, on sorghum plants in microcosms. Pairs of C. maculata larvae suppressed aphids better than pairs of C. carnea larvae or heterospecific larval pairs and yielded the highest rate of plant survival. IGP by C. carnea larvae occurred mostly in the first instar, whereas C. maculata larvae were more aggressive in later instars. Although C. carnea was the superior intraguild predator, winning 62.7% of contests in microcosms, this value increased to 88.9% when the experiment was repeated in petri dishes without plant material, regardless of whether greenbugs or eggs of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller were offered as focal prey. Provision in petri dishes of the sessile, higher quality prey (Ephestia) as opposed to greenbugs, improved the survival of solitary larvae and delayed cannibalism and IGP until later developmental stages in both species. Larvae of C. maculata that cannibalized took longer to develop and weighed less at pupation, independent of the arena or prey offered. Although larvae of C. carnea did not pay a cost for cannibalism or IGP in microcosms, there were some negative developmental effects of IGP in petri dishes, particularly on the Ephestia diet. These results illustrate how the plant, as a substrate, can mediate the strength of IGP interactions and how the relative suitability of the focal prey can influence both the timing and consequences of cannibalism and IGP.",https://doi.org/10.1603/an11165,0
599,The benefits of intraguild predation for a top predator spider,"1. Intraguild predation (IGP) among generalist predators significantly affects the food web dynamics but the benefits of IGP for top predators are still unclear. 2. We offered diets consisting of aphids, of spiders, and their sequential mix (i.e. polytypic diet) to the spider Philodromus cespitum and measured its survival, weight, development, and fecundity. To avoid a species‐specific effect, the aphid and spider prey consisted of several similarly sized species. 3. The spider diet prolonged survival in comparison to starvation while the aphid and polytypic diets enabled the highest survival of juveniles. The spider diet resulted in low weight gain and slow development in juveniles at the population level. However, the weight change was highly variable among individuals, and a substantial portion of the individuals engaging in IGP gained the most weight compared to other diets. The aphid and polytypic diets resulted in the largest weight increase and fastest development in juveniles at the population level, and there was little variability in the amount of weight gained among individuals. Diet did not affect survival of adult females, but females on the spider and polytypic diets had higher fecundity than those on the aphid diet. 4. While both the aphids and the spiders had energetic and nutritional value for Philodromus cespitum , a polytypic diet consisting of a mix of them improved overall fitness. IGP therefore seems to be an adaptive strategy of Philodromus cespitum , and IGP on small spiders may increase its performance in ecosystems where aphids are highly dominant pests.",https://doi.org/10.1111/een.12960,0
600,Cannibalism and Intraguild Predation of Eggs Within a Diverse Predator Assemblage,"Greater biodiversity among aphid predators sometimes leads to greater predator reproductive success. This could occur if cannibalism of predator eggs is consistently stronger than intraguild predation, such that diversity dilutes cannibalism risk when total predator densities remain constant across diversity levels. We compared the frequency of cannibalism versus intraguild predation by adult predators of four species [the lady beetles Coccinella septempunctata L. and Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville, and the predatory bugs Geocoris bullatus (Say) and Nabis alternatus Parshley] on the eggs of three predator species (all of these predators but Nabis). For both coccinellid species, egg predation averaged across all intraguild predators was less frequent than cannibalism. In contrast, Geocoris eggs were generally more likely to be consumed by intraguild predators than by conspecifics. Closer inspection of the data revealed that Geocoris consistently consumed fewer eggs than the other species, regardless of egg species. Indeed, for lady beetle eggs it was relatively infrequent egg predation by Geocoris that brought down the average across all heterospecific predators, masking the fact that adults of the two lady beetles were no more likely to act as egg cannibals than as intraguild predators. Nabis ate eggs of the two beetles at approximately equal rates, but rarely ate Geocoris eggs. Female predators generally consumed more eggs than did males, but this did not alter any of the patterns described above. Altogether, our results suggest that species-specific differences in egg predation rates determined the relative intensity of egg intraguild-predation versus cannibalism, rather than any more general trend for egg cannibalism to always exceed intraguild predation.",https://doi.org/10.1603/en10047,0
601,"Keystone and Intraguild Predation, Intraspecific Density Dependence, and a Guild of Coexisting Consumers","Previous models of diamond-shaped and intraguild predation community modules have represented the essence of the trade-off necessary for a top predator to prevent competitive exclusion among a set of resource-limited consumers. However, at most two consumers can coexist in these models. In this article, I show how intraspecific density dependence in the consumers can permit many more than two consumers to coexist in these community modules. Moreover, responses of the community to removal of the top predator depend on the patterns of the strengths of species interactions relative to the strengths of intraspecific density dependence. If the consumers experience similar strengths of intraspecific density dependence, removing the top predator will in most cases have little effect on consumer species richness. A substantial reduction in consumer species richness with predator removal (i.e., the keystone predation effect) will typically occur only when the consumer that can support a population at the lowest resource abundance also (1) experiences substantially weaker intraspecific density dependence than other consumers and (2) experiences significantly higher levels of mortality from the predator. These results identify how intraspecific density dependence fosters the coexistence of multiple consumers in two important community modules and shapes the responses of these community modules to perturbations such as predator removal.",https://doi.org/10.1086/674010,0
602,Spatial Dynamics of Communities with Intraguild Predation: The Role of Dispersal Strategies,"I investigate the influence of dispersal strategies on intraguild prey and predators (competing species that prey on each other). I find an asymmetry between the intraguild prey and predator in their responses to each other’s dispersal. The intraguild predator’s dispersal strategy and dispersal behavior have strong effects on the intraguild prey’s abundance pattern, but the intraguild prey’s dispersal strategy and behavior have little or no effect on the intraguild predator’s abundance pattern. This asymmetry arises from the different constraints faced by the two species: the intraguild prey has to acquire resources while avoiding predation, but the intraguild predator only has to acquire resources. It leads to puzzling distribution patterns: when the intraguild prey and predator both move away from areas of high density, they become aggregated to high‐density habitats, but when they both move toward areas of high resource productivity, they become segregated to resource‐poor and resource‐rich habitats. Aggregation is more likely when dispersal is random or less optimal, and segregation is more likely as dispersal becomes more optimal. The crucial implication is that trophic constraints dictate the fitness benefits of using dispersal strategies to sample environmental heterogeneity. A strategy that affords greater benefits to an intraguild predator can lead to a more optimal outcome for both the intraguild predator and prey than a strategy that affords greater benefits to an intraguild prey.",https://doi.org/10.2307/4541156,0
603,"Cannibalism and Intraguild Predation Community Dynamics: Coexistence, Competitive Exclusion, and the Loss of Alternative Stable States","Predators often exert strong top-down regulation of prey, but in many systems, juvenile predators must compete with their future prey for a shared resource. In such life-history intraguild predation (LHIGP) systems, prey can therefore also regulate the recruitment and thus population dynamics of their predator via competition. Theory predicts that such stage-structured systems exhibit a wide range of dynamics, including alternative stable states. Here we show that cannibalism is an exceedingly common interaction within natural LHIGP systems that determines what coexistence states are possible. Using a modeling approach that simulates a range of ontogenetic diet shift scenarios along a productivity gradient, we demonstrate that only if the predator is competitively dominant can cannibalism promote coexistence by allowing prey to persist. If the prey is competitively dominant, cannibalism instead results in competitive exclusion of the predator and the loss of potential alternative stable states. Further, predator exclusion occurs at low cannibalistic preference relative to empirical estimates and is consistent across LHIGP systems in which the predator undergoes a complete diet shift or diet broadening over ontogeny. Given that prey is frequently competitively dominant in natural systems, our results demonstrate that even weak cannibalism can inhibit predator persistence, prompting exploration of mechanisms that reconcile theory with the common occurrence of such interactions in nature.",https://doi.org/10.1086/693997,0

We tested the preference of the adults and fourth-instar larvae of C. montrouzieri for healthy mealybugs and parasitized mealybugs harboring 1-, 4-, 7- and 14-day-old parasitoid larvae. The experiments were conducted in no-choice (only unparasitized mealybugs or parasitized mealybugs of one parasitoid age were offered at one time) and choice (unparasitized and parasitized mealybugs of a specific age were offered simultaneously) tests. Both the adults and larvae of C. montrouzieri fed on unparasitized and parasitized mealybugs but strongly discriminated against the hardened mummies (14 days old). We also investigated the influence of the presence of C. montrouzieri to the foraging effectiveness of L. dactylopii. The level of parasitism by L. dactylopii was reduced from about 13 to 6% when the number of the C. montrouzieri was increased from zero to four. We recommended that the releases of C. montrouzieri should be conducted 14 days after the releases of L. dactylopii to reduce intraguild predation on the parasitized mealybugs and to avoid interference with the foraging parasitoids.",https://doi.org/10.1080/09583150701596305,0
605,"Intraguild Predation on Congeners Affects Size, Aggression, and Survival among Ambystoma Salamander Larvae","I designed laboratory and mesocosm experiments to test the hypotheses that consumption of a congener as supplemental food can increase the size variance, size, aggression rates, and mortality of intraguild predator populations. Experimental populations of Marbled Salamander (Ambystoma opacum), Jefferson Salamander (Ambystoma jeffersonianum) and Tiger Salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) larvae that were initially fed a smaller congener Spotted Salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) as a food supplement developed larger SVL and size variation after seven days than control larvae that were not fed a congener. Experimental treatment populations had greater initial size variation because some larvae ate a congener and others did not. Treatment larvae had increased SVL, aggression rates and mortality after 60 days compared to control populations. These results suggest that intraguild predation on a congener can affect fitness and population dynamics of predator populations. I hypothesize that intraguild predation on congeners results in size variation and then increased aggression and mortality caused by cannibalism.",https://doi.org/10.1670/29-03a,0
606,A test of the hypothesis that a pathway of intraguild predation limits densities of a wolf spider,"Abstract. 1. The high number of potential predatory interactions among the many arthropod generalist predators in terrestrial food webs makes exhaustive testing of interaction strengths by field experiments unfeasible. Thus, correlative patterns and laboratory observations of behaviour often form the basis of inferences about the strength of interaction pathways involving generalist predators (intraguild predation). 2. Previous research has revealed a negative correlation between survival of juvenile wolf spiders of the genus Schizocosa (Lycosidae) and densities of another abundant spider family, the Gnaphosidae. 3. Feeding trials in laboratory microcosms with a leaf‐litter substrate revealed that gnaphosids prey on juvenile Schizocosa in a structurally complex habitat. 4. Gnaphosid densities were manipulated in two different field experiments, each conducted in a different year, in order to test directly the hypothesis that intraguild predation by gnaphosids limits densities of juvenile Schizocosa . 5. Reducing numbers of gnaphosids, and doubling their numbers to two times the mean natural density, had no impact on the survival of juvenile Schizocosa in either field experiment. This finding suggests that correlative patterns in nature and feeding trials in the laboratory may at times provide deceptively simple and potentially misleading generalisations about the strengths of interaction pathways in complex networks of generalist predators.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0307-6946.2004.00601.x,0
607,Diet-dependent intraguild predation between the predatory mites Neoseiulus californicus and Neoseiulus cucumeris,"Based on the hypothesis that matching diets of intraguild (IG) predator and prey indicate strong food competition and thus intensify intraguild predation (IGP) as compared to non-matching diets, we scrutinized diet-dependent mutual IGP between the predatory mites Neoseiulus cucumeris and N. californicus. Both are natural enemies of herbivorous mites and insects and used in biological control of spider mites and thrips in various agricultural crops. Both are generalist predators that may also feed on plant-derived substances such as pollen. Irrespective of diet (pollen or spider mites), N. cucumeris females had higher predation and oviposition rates and shorter attack latencies on IG prey than N. californicus. Predation rates on larvae were unaffected by diet but larvae from pollen-fed mothers were a more profitable prey than those from spider-mite fed mothers resulting in higher oviposition rates of IG predator females. Pollen-fed protonymphs were earlier attacked by IG predator females than spider-mite fed protonymphs. Spider mite-fed N. californicus females attacked protonymphs earlier than did pollen-fed N. californicus females. Overall, our study suggests that predator and prey diet may exert subtle influences on mutual IGP between bio-control agents. Matching diets did not intensify IGP between N. californicus and N. cucumeris but predator and prey diets proximately influenced IGP through changes in behaviour and/or stoichiometry.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2010.01548.x,0
608,Intraguild Predation Responses in Two Aphidophagous Coccinellids Identify Differences among Juvenile Stages and Aphid Densities,"(1) Intraguild predation (IGP) can occur among aphidophagous predators thus reducing their effectiveness in controlling crop pests. Among ladybirds, Coccinella septempunctata L. and Hippodamia variegata Goeze are the most effective predators upon Aphis gossypii Glov., which is an economically important pest of melon. Understanding their likelihood to engage in reciprocal predation is a key point for conservation of biological control. Here, we aim to investigate, under laboratory conditions, the level of IGP between the two above mentioned aphidophagous species. (2) Fourth-instars of the two species were isolated in petri dishes with combinations of different stages of the heterospecific ladybird and different densities of A. gossypii. The occurrence of IGP events was recorded after six hours. (3) C. septempunctata predated H. variegata at a higher rate than vice versa (70% vs. 43% overall). Higher density of the aphid or older juvenile stage of the IG-prey (22% of fourth instars vs. 74% of eggs and second instars) reduces the likelihood of predation. (4) To our knowledge, IGP between C. septempunctata and H. variegata was investigated for the first time. Results represent a baseline, necessary to predict the likelihood of IGP occurrence in the field.",https://doi.org/10.3390/insects5040974,0
609,Assessing the potential for intraguild predation among taxonomically disparate micro-carnivores: marsupials and arthropods,"Interspecific competition may occur when resources are limited, and is often most intense between animals in the same ecological guild. Intraguild predation (IGP) is a distinctive form of interference competition, where a dominant predator selectively kills subordinate rivals to gain increased access to resources. However, before IGP can be identified, organisms must be confirmed as members of the same guild and occur together in space and time. The lesser hairy-footed dunnart (Sminthopsis youngsoni, Dasyuridae) is a generalist marsupial insectivore in arid Australia, but consumes wolf spiders (Lycosa spp., Lycosidae) disproportionately often relative to their availability. Here, we test the hypothesis that this disproportionate predation is a product of frequent encounter rates between the interactants due to high overlap in their diets and use of space and time. Diet and prey availability were determined using direct observations and invertebrate pitfall trapping, microhabitat use by tracking individuals of both species-groups, and temporal activity using spotlighting and camera traps. Major overlap (greater than 75% similarity) was found in diet and temporal activity, and weaker overlap in microhabitat use. Taken together, these findings suggest reasonable potential, for the first time, for competition and intraguild predation to occur between taxa as disparate as marsupials and spiders.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.171872,0
610,Tigers eating tigers: evidence of intraguild predation operating in an assemblage of tiger beetles,"Summary 1. Co‐occurrence of closely related predators in a prey‐limited habitat appears to contradict the principle of competitive exclusion, however it may be explained through indirect effects, niche shifts, and intraguild predation. 2. The interactions between sympatric tiger beetle Cicindela species were examined. Cicindela circumpicta is the largest of three species ( C. circumpicta , C. togata , C. fulgida ) found in saline habitats throughout central North America. The temporal occurrence of these species overlaps, as does their spatial occurrence on exposed salt flats of saline marshes. During field observations, exoskeletal remains of C. togata were found at the study site in Nebraska, U.S.A. 3. In laboratory trials, male C. circumpicta ate C. togata in 38% of trials and female C. circumpicta ate C. togata in 50% of trials ( n = 24). 4. In the field, potential prey, consisting mainly of small flies, was found mostly in shaded conditions but tiger beetles differed significantly in shade use, with C. circumpicta spending 70% of the time in the shade compared with ≈ 20% for C. togata . Differential habitat use was not explained by maximum temperature tolerances, which did not differ between the species. 5. Laboratory trials established that both tiger beetle species consumed small prey (apterous Drosophila ) but C. togata was more efficient at capturing winged Drosophila . 6. Foraging efficiency, as measured by the time taken for a C. togata to capture three prey items, decreased significantly in the presence of other tiger beetles, especially C. circumpicta . 7. These results are an indication that intraguild predation and induced changes in foraging behaviour operate in the ecology of adult tiger beetles.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2311.2001.00333.x,0
611,Incorporation of Intraguild Predation Into a Pest Management Decision-Making Tool: The Case of Thrips and Two Pollen-Feeding Predators in Strawberry,"Action thresholds are traditionally based on the density of pests and the economic damage they cause to crops. Pest damage assessments are usually made in a ""sterile"" environment, devoid of extenuating factors such as predators, parasitoids, and alternative food sources. Recently, the effects of a predator or parasitoid species have been considered. However, interactions between natural enemy species (intraguild predation and interference), which are common in agricultural fields, have not been incorporated yet into decision-making tools. We conducted a series of leaf disc and potted plant trials to evaluate the effects of two predator species, the anthocorid Orius laevigatus (Fieber) and the phytoseiid Neoseiulus cucumeris (Oudemans) on the density of and fruit damage inflicted by western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande). We then used the obtained results to develop a pest management decision-making tool for the control of western flower thrips. Because strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne) flower in cycles, pollen, a food source for both predators and the pest, is periodically available in the system and has also been incorporated in our decision-making tool. The developed new management tool would allow the relaxation of the economic threshold (ET) for western flower thrips in strawberry flowers. The presence of an average of a single O. laevigatus per flower for example, may allow that relaxation of the ET by 40% (from 10 to 14 western flower thrips per flower) when pollen is available during the winter. Because field monitoring shows that O. laevigatus populations in Israeli strawberry often reach mean densities of three to four per flower, the new approach promises to drastically reduce the employment of toxic insecticides.",https://doi.org/10.1603/ec09373,0
612,Does nitrogen limitation promote intraguild predation in an aphidophagous ladybird?,"Abstract Reciprocal intraguild predation occurs between the two aphidophagous ladybird beetles Coccinella septempunctata L. and Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). However, its direction is asymmetrical; H. axyridis generally acts as an intraguild predator, and C. septempunctata as an intraguild prey. According to Denno and Fagan's prediction that nitrogen shortages in predators may promote intraguild predation, it was hypothesized that growth of intraguild predator H. axyridis is more limited by nitrogen than that of intraguild prey C. septempunctata , and that H. axyridis growth is enhanced by feeding on C. septempunctata compared to feeding on aphids. To determine nitrogen‐limited growth in H. axyridis , the following two predictions were examined. First, it was predicted that the nitrogen content of H. axyridis would be higher than that of C. septempunctata when both feed on aphids. However, nitrogen content did not differ between the two ladybirds. Second, it was predicted that nitrogen‐use efficiency of H. axyridis would be lower than that of C. septempunctata . However, there was no significant difference between species. These results did not support the hypothesis that growth of H. axyridis is more limited by nitrogen than that of C. septempunctata. In addition, the present study showed that dry mass and nitrogen growth of H. axyridis were not enhanced, but rather decreased, by eating high‐nitrogen C. septempunctata , compared to eating low‐nitrogen aphids. Overall, the present study did not support the hypothesis that nitrogen shortages in predators may promote intraguild predation.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2006.00414.x,0
613,Do the antipredator strategies of shared prey mediate intraguild predation and mesopredator suppression?,"Understanding the conditions that facilitate top predator effects upon mesopredators and prey is critical for predicting where these effects will be significant. Intraguild predation (IGP) and the ecology of fear are hypotheses used to describe the effects of top predators upon mesopredators and prey species, but make different assumptions about organismal space use. The IGP hypothesis predicts that mesopredator resource acquisition and risk are positively correlated, creating a fitness deficit. But if shared prey also avoid a top predator, then mesopredators may not have to choose between risk and reward. Prey life history may be a critical predictor of how shared prey respond to predation and may mediate mesopredator suppression. We used hierarchical models of species distribution and abundance to test expectations of IGP using two separate triangular relationships between a large carnivore, smaller intraguild carnivore, and shared mammalian prey with different life histories. Following IGP, we expected that a larger carnivore would suppress a smaller carnivore if the shared prey species did not spatially avoid the large carnivore at broad scales. If prey were fearful over broad scales, we expected less evidence of mesopredator suppression. We tested these theoretical hypotheses using remote camera detections across a large spatial extent. Lagomorphs did not appear to avoid coyotes, and fox detection probability was lower as coyote abundance increased. In contrast, white-tailed deer appeared to avoid areas of increased wolf use, and coyote detection probability was not reduced at sites where wolves occurred. These findings suggest that mesopredator suppression by larger carnivores may depend upon the behavior of shared prey, specifically the spatial scale at which they perceive risk. We further discuss how extrinsic environmental factors may contribute to mesopredator suppression.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.2170,0
614,Intraguild predation between Amblyseius swirskii and two native Chinese predatory mite species and their development on intraguild prey,"Abstract Amblyseius swirskii , native to the east and southeast Mediterranean region, is a successful biological control agent of whiteflies. In this study, we investigated intraguild predations (IGP) between each stage of A. swirskii and each stage of two Phytoseiid species that occur in China, Amblyseius orientalis and Neoseiulus californicus . When there was no whitefly egg provided as the extraguild prey, IGP between A. swirskii and A. orientalis , and between A. swirskii and N. californicus , was observed in 10 and 20 out of 35 combinations, respectively. When IGP was observed, A. swirskii was the intraguild predator in 70% and 65% cases of A. orientalis and N. californicus predation, respectively. These results suggest that A. swirskii is a more aggressive intraguild predator compared to either A. orientalis or N. californicus . When whitefly eggs were provided as the extraguild prey, IGP between A. swirskii and N. californicus decreased greatly, but no significant decrease of IGP was observed between A. swirskii and A. orientalis . Amblyseius swirskii was able to complete development on both heterospecific predatory mites, and both heterospecific predatory mites completed their development on A. swirskii . Possible impacts that A. swirskii may have on local predatory mite populations in China are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1038/srep22992,0
615,Intraguild Predation Among Three Common Coccinellids (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in China: Detection Using DNA-Based Gut-Content Analysis,"The ubiquity of intraguild predation (IGP) has been widely recognized for predatory coccinellids (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). In Chinese agroecosystems, three species (Coccinella septempunctata L., Harmonia axyridis (Pallas), and Propylea japonica (Thunberg)) are particularly common, but there is little information of interactions occurring between them. In no-choice laboratory feeding trials, differential directional predation was observed between species: C. septempunctata preyed on eggs of P. japonica more than H. axyridis and H. axyridis consumed eggs of C. septempunctata and P. japonica equally, whereas P. japonica had a very low predation rate on eggs of the other two species. In choice trials, C. septempunctata and P. japonica larvae preyed less on H. axyridis eggs than those of P. japonica and C. septempunctata, respectively, contrasting with H. axyridis larvae, which showed similar preference for both species. Species-specific primers were developed for each coccinellid and used to determine the relative frequency of prey consumption in the field. Prior to field-based analysis, primer specificity was confirmed and consumption of prey elicited a positive reaction success, and detection time varied between different predator–prey combinations. Predators were then collected from cotton agroecosystems and, interestingly, no DNA of C. septempunctata was found in P. japonica, but all other predator–prey combinations yielded positive documentation of IGP in the field, with the greatest rate of 9% of C. septempunctata testing positive for H. axyridis DNA. This study confirmed the frequency of IGP among three common coccinellids in Chinese agroecosystems and the likelihood for interference to the biological control services provided by these important natural enemies.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvw154,0
616,Plant quality effects on intraguild predation between <i>Orius laevigatus</i> and <i>Aphidoletes aphidimyza</i>,"Abstract To understand the influence of plant quality on intraguild predation and consequently on the suppression of a shared prey population as well as on plant yield, the interactions between Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae) (shared prey), Aphidoletes aphidimyza (Rondani) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) (intermediate predator), and Orius laevigatus Fieber (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) (top predator) were investigated in 25‐day experiments on cucumber, Cucumis sativus L. (Cucurbitaceae) at various N fertilization levels (90, 150, and 190 p.p.m.) in microcosm set‐ups under greenhouse conditions. The final aphid population size was significantly affected by an interactive effect of N fertilization and predator application. Regardless of the N fertilization levels, O. laevigatus alone was more effective in aphid suppression than A. aphidimyza alone. In addition, the risk for aphids of being predated upon by both predators together was significantly reduced in the low and medium‐N fertilization levels, whereas it was additive in the high‐N fertilization treatment. The A. aphidimyza population was suppressed by O. laevigatus in both the 90 and 150 p.p.m. N treatments. However, there was no intraguild predation of O. laevigatus on A. aphidimyza at the 190 p.p.m. N level. Total plant yield depended on predator treatments and N fertilization levels, with the highest yield produced at the 150 p.p.m. N fertilization level in treatments with either O. laevigatus alone or with both predators together. Our results demonstrate that the weak asymmetric intraguild predation among A. aphidimyza and O. laevigatus does not influence the ability of both predators together to diminish bottom‐up effects on aphid populations and the yield losses associated with aphid infestations.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2010.00982.x,0
617,Alternative prey mediate intraguild predation in the open field,"Generalist predators that kill and eat other natural enemies can weaken biological control. However, pest suppression can be disrupted even if actual intraguild predation is infrequent, if predators reduce their foraging to lower their risk of being killed. In turn, predator-predator interference might be frequent when few other prey are available, but less common when herbivorous and detritus-feeding prey are plentiful. We used molecular gut-content analysis to track consumption of the predatory bug Geocoris sp. by the larger intraguild predator Nabis sp., in organic and conventional potato (Solanum tuberosum) fields.We found that higher densities of both aphids and thrips, two common herbivores, correlated with higher probability of detecting intraguild predation. Perhaps, Nabis foraging for these herbivores also encountered and ate more Geocoris. Surprisingly, likelihood of intraguild predation was not strongly linked to densities of either Nabis or Geocoris, or farming system, suggesting a greater importance for prey than predator community structure. Intriguingly, we found evidence that Geocoris fed more often on the detritus-feeding fly Scaptomyza pallida with increasing predator evenness. This would be consistent with Geocoris shifting to greater foraging on the ground, where S. pallida would be relatively abundant, in the face of greater risk of intraguild predation.Overall, our findings suggest that while herbivorous prey may heighten intraguild predation of Geocoris in the foliage, detritivores might support a shift to safer foraging on the ground. This provides further evidence that prey abundance and diversity can act to either heighten or relax predator-predator interference, depending on prey species identity and predator behavior. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ps.6825,0
618,Microcosm studies on intraguild predation between female erigonid spiders and lacewing larvae and influence of single versus multiple predators on cereal aphids,"Abstract: Intraguild predation between female erigonid spiders [ Erigone atra (Blackwall) and Oedothorax apicatus (Blackwall), Araneae, Erigonidae] and lacewing larvae (second instar larvae of Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens), Neuropt., Chrysopidae) and interaction effects of predator combinations on cereal aphids were investigated in a microcosm system under laboratory conditions. The microcosm experiments were run for 7 days and consisted of 15wheat seedlings, 15 Sitobion avenae (F) (Hom., Aphididae) as start population, plus a female spider or a lacewing larva or a combination of a spider plus a lacewing larva. The mortality rate of lacewing larvae was significantly increased by 44 and 31% due to intraguild predation by female spiders of E. atra and O. apicatus in comparison with lacewing larvae that were kept alone. The final aphid numbers in the microcosms were significantly reduced by all single predator treatments (spiders, lacewing larvae) and the predator combinations in comparison with controls without predators. The predation effect on aphid populations due to both spider species was similar and not statistically different. An additive effect of the predator combinations ‘spider plus surviving lacewing larva’ was found for both spider species resulting in reduced aphid numbers compared with the single predator treatments. When the lacewing larva was killed by an E. atra female the effects on aphids were non‐additive, but aphid numbers were not statistically increased compared with the lacewing larva treatment. When the lacewing larva was killed by an O. apicatus female, the effects of spider and C. carnea larva were additive on aphid numbers. In the presence of additional prey (fruit flies and Collembola) intraguild predation was not found and E. atra females had no significant effect on the survival of lacewing larvae. In addition, E. atra females had no significant effect on aphid numbers in the presence of fruit flies and Collembola, but in combination with a lacewing larva that survived, a significantly greater reduction of the aphid population was observed compared with the lacewing larva treatment. The body mass of lacewing larvae at the end of the experiment was not statistically influenced by the presence or absence of an E. atra female.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0418.2002.00638.x,0

Two experiments were performed in the laboratory to assess the behaviour of dropping from a host plant as a defence against intraguild predation in aphidophagous ladybird larvae. 2.

620,Life Cycle Complexity Influences Intraguild Predation and Cannibalism in Pond Communities,"Predation risk is an important contributor to community structure that varies in response to abiotic and biotic factors. In aquatic habitats, predation risk is often linked to hydroperiod as the latter directly influences predator identity within these ecosystems. For pond-breeding salamanders, intraguild predation (IGP) and cannibalism are prevalent interactions in larval communities, but the frequency of each type of agonistic interaction, as well as changes in their pervasiveness along hydroperiod gradients are not well understood. Size-structured populations of aquatic life stages (paedomorphic adults and overwintered larvae) of mole salamanders (Ambystoma talpoideum) have the potential to be dominant IG predators and cannibals in permanent ponds because of large size advantages over successive cohorts, but the species exists as only a single larval cohort in temporary ponds with reduced predatory abilities on guild members. Thus, both the potential for and intensity of predation by this species is linked to hydroperiod; yet, the predatory abilities of aquatic life stages of mole salamanders have not been evaluated. This study examined the extent to which larger size classes (paedomorphs and overwintered larvae) of mole salamanders preyed upon conspecifics and a congeneric competitor, the spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum). Predation trials occurred in indoor microcosms and were executed under two habitat treatments that included pseudo-natural conditions containing alternate prey and refugia, as well as simplified environments (no alternative food or cover). Embryos or hatchlings of mole and spotted salamanders were exposed either separately or concurrently to paedomorphic and overwintered larval mole salamanders in each habitat treatment. Additionally, overwintered larvae were offered as prey to paedomorphic adults. No significant differences in mortality were observed between habitat treatments (complex versus simple) for either embryo or hatchling predation experiments. Mortality of mole and spotted embryos did not differ when they were offered separately or together, but paedomorphs caused significantly higher mortality among mole embryos compared to spotted embryos. Hatchlings of both species were heavily preyed upon (nearly 100% in all trials), but overwintered larvae exhibited 100% survival with paedomorph predators, indicating size-thresholds of predation risk that were not species specific. Paedomorphs and overwintered larvae therefore are most likely generalist predators that feed equally and effectively on hatchlings of co-occurring species, but are more likely to consume egg masses that do not incur significant handling costs. When present, paedomorphs or overwintered larvae have the potential to alter population dynamics of both guild members and conspecifics by being dominant predators on early life stages. As the prevalence of overwintering and paedomorphosis varies along hydroperiod gradients, predation risk from this species is likely to occur discontinuously and thereby may be an important, yet variable, structuring force.",https://doi.org/10.1643/ce-12-034,0
621,Ecological Interactions between Rana sylvatica and Ambystoma maculatum: Evidence of Interspecific Competition and Facultative Intraguild Predation,"Rana sylvatica (Wood Frog) tadpoles subsist as microphagous suspension feeders but opportunistically prey on macroinvertebrates and embryos of Ambystoma maculatum (Spotted Salamander). We conducted two mesocosm experiments to determine whether breeding phenology and presence of Rana affect the growth, time to metamorphosis, and survival of Ambystoma (Experiment 1) and whether Rana density and access to Ambystoma embryos affect the growth, duration of larval period, and survival of both species (Experiment 2). Rana did not affect Ambystoma embryonic survival in either experiment. In Experiment 1, seasonal time of oviposition did not affect the overall response of Ambystoma larvae; however, Rana presence decreased larval survival and prolonged time to metamorphosis. In Experiment 2, relatively high tadpole density significantly reduced Ambystoma survival and decreased Rana survival, growth, and development. The results of this and other studies suggest that R. sylvatica may adversely affect A. maculatum through an array of context-dependent interactions, including indirect food web alteration, direct competition for benthic macroinvertebrates and zooplankton, and consumption of embryos. We provide a conditional interpretation of community organization that encompasses bottom-up and top-down effects generated by Rana on community members.",https://doi.org/10.1643/ce-04-037r1,0
622,Differential habitat use and recruitment facilitate coexistence in a community with intraguild predation,"Theory predicts that species engaged in intraguild predation (IGP) can only coexist under limited conditions, yet IGP is common in nature. Habitat complexity can promote coexistence by reducing encounter rates, but little information is known about the contribution of differential habitat use. We hypothesized that differential use of alternative habitats promotes coexistence of an intraguild (IG) predator and prey. We evaluated predictions of this hypothesis with an experimental introduction of an IG predator fish into four natural stream communities that previously contained only the IG prey fish. We monitored the development of this IGP over the course of four years to determine how each species used alternative stream habitats. The introduced species preferred pool habitats while the resident species was more evenly distributed across pools and riffles. The density of the resident decreased in the pool habitat preferred by the invader, accompanied by a local increase in the mean of the resident size distribution. Selective predation by the invader on hatchling residents appears to impact the residents' demographic response. The continued recruitment of resident juveniles in riffles, where the introduced species is rare, facilitated the persistence of the resident. This differential use of habitats was not accompanied by a change in the resident's growth rates in either habitat. Our results showed that differential habitat selection and recruitment promoted persistence during an invasion involving IGP, which helps to bridge the gap between theory and observation in explaining coexistence in IGP systems.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3558,0
623,"Diet and reproductive success of an Arctic generalist predator: Interplay between variations in prey abundance, nest site location, and intraguild predation","Under varying prey abundance, generalist consumers should be less affected than specialists due to their more diverse diet. Nonetheless, when prey availability declines, interspecific competition among consumers should increase and could lead to increased intraguild predation. We examined these potential effects in a generalist predator of the tundra, the Glaucous Gull (Larus hyperboreus), over a 7-yr period characterized by large fluctuations in lemming abundance, a potential prey item for gulls. We studied diet by analyzing regurgitated pellets collected at nests and blood nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes, and we monitored annual nesting density and reproductive success on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada. Stable isotopes revealed a relatively similar contribution of terrestrial and marine food sources to the gull diet, although the terrestrial contribution increased in the year of high lemming abundance. According to analysis of pellets, diet during incubation was dominated by geese and lemmings, whereas geese were the main prey during chick-rearing. As expected for a generalist predator, annual variation in diet during incubation reflected overall lemming abundance, and the increased consumption of geese during chick-rearing was associated with an influx of goose families into the study area at that time. Gull nest density, laying date, clutch size, and mass gain of chicks did not vary with lemming population fluctuations. Hatching success, on the other hand, was positively related to lemming abundance and was greater for nests located on islets than for those along the shores of ponds and lakes. Intraguild predation on gull eggs by predators such as Arctic foxes, which primarily feed on lemmings during the summer, was probably the main cause of nest failure. Although a generalist predator like the Glaucous Gull has a diversified diet and may feed only opportunistically on lemmings, our results suggest that large cyclical fluctuations in lemming abundance may still affect gull reproductive success through intraguild predation.",https://doi.org/10.1642/auk-14-273.1,0
624,Roles of Alternative Prey for Mesopredators on Trophic Cascades in Intraguild Predation Systems: A Theoretical Perspective,"Declines of apex predators can cause dramatic increases of smaller predators and ensuing collapses of their prey. However, recent empirical evidence finds that the disappearance of apex predators does not reduce but can increase prey populations. This poses a great challenge in managing species interactions involving mesopredator release. Here we analyze a mathematical model to explain variable consequences of apex predator loss and to develop management guidelines for prey conservation. The model formulates an intraguild predation system (apex predators, mesopredators, and their shared prey) with mesopredators supplied with additional alternative prey. We show that apex predator loss causes only negative effects on shared prey without alternative prey but has either negative or positive effects with alternative prey. Moreover, when alternative prey is highly abundant, apex predator loss causes strong mesopredator release and reduces shared prey greatly. Finally, the model suggests that a viable management strategy to restore shared prey under much uncertainty about a target system is to allocate a limited control effort not only to both predators but also to alternative prey. Alternative prey for mesopredators may be a crucial ingredient that controls the cascading dynamics of intraguild predation systems and should be considered as an important management target.",https://doi.org/10.1086/675691,0

Butler IV*, Jennifer A. Lear Department of Biological Sciences, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia 23529, USA *Email: mbutler@odu.edu ABSTRACT: Intraguild predation occurs when species simultaneously compete for resources and interact as predator and prey, which describes the interaction between juvenile Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus and Caribbean reef octopus Octopus briareus in the Florida Keys, USA. Octopuses are notorious predators of decapod crustaceans, and their use of crevice shelters suggests that they may also compete for shelter with their lobster prey. Lobsters use mainly chemical cues to detect and avoid octopus, so we hypothesized that the negative association between these species may be as much the consequence of avoidance of a superior competitor as it is of direct predation. Surveys of lobsters and octopuses occupying artificial shelters at 19 hard-bottom sites confirmed that lobsters do not share dens with octopuses, and also show that lobster and octopus abundances are negatively correlated. Tethering experiments on a subset of those sites revealed that predation on lobster was indeed higher on sites with more octopuses. Results from mesocosm studies indicated that although juvenile lobsters do not attain a size refuge from octopus predation, the presence of alternative prey and lobster conspecifics reduces the risk of predation on lobster by octopus. Mesocosm experiments also showed that octopuses were the competitive dominants when shelter was limited. Thus, the negative association between lobster and octopus in the field appears to be driven by both predation and avoidance of octopus-rich sites by lobsters, rather than competition per se. However, crevice shelters suitable for juvenile lobster are limited in many hard-bottom areas in the Florida Keys, so areas where octopuses are abundant may further limit the local accessibility of shelters for juvenile spiny lobsters even if the direct effects of predation by octopus are minimal.

626,Unstable intraguild predation causes establishment failure of a globally invasive species,"Abstract Biotic resistance is often posited, but rarely known, to be the cause of invasion failure. Competition and predation are the most frequently identified processes that may prevent or limit the establishment of nonnative species. Interactions between nonnative and native species that involve intraguild predation (IGP) are very common in nature, although theory predicts most IGP systems should be unstable and lead to extinction. If this prediction is true, the frequency of invasion failures due to IGP may be underappreciated because of their fleeting nature and, thus, studies of unstable IGP systems are lacking, despite the opportunities they offer for understanding the factors affecting their unstable dynamics. We investigated a failed invasion involving an IGP relationship. In Florida, the guppy ( Poecilia reticulata ), a worldwide invader, fails to establish in the presence of eastern mosquitofish ( Gambusia holbrooki ). We tested whether and how resident mosquitofish cause guppy invasion failure using replicated mesocosm and aquarium trials. Both the predator and competitor components of the IGP relationship were strongly asymmetrical, with large impacts on guppies. We identified two effects, direct consumption of neonates and aggressive interference competition, that limited survival and recruitment. The highly unstable nature of this IGP relationship is the primary cause of the failure of the guppy to establish in Florida. Our study shows that the transient nature of an ephemeral IGP relationship can yield important insights into the underlying causes of invasion failure, including the role of strong biotic resistance.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3411,0
627,Intraguild predation of non-coccinellid aphid natural enemies by Harmonia axyridis: prey range and factors influencing intraguild predation,"The Coccinellidae Recording Scheme, the UK’s scheme for mapping coccinellid distributions, was launched in 1968 and was led by Michael Majerus from the 1980s. In the early years participants tended to be experienced naturalists, so to draw others in, Mike set up a very successful offshoot, the Cambridge Ladybird Survey (CLS), a public outreach survey that ran from 1984 to 1994. The CLS generated a huge amount of data and made a significant contribution to Mike’s New Naturalist ‘Ladybirds’ book (1994). When Harmonia axyridis arrived in the UK in late 2004, Mike realised the potential for involving the public in a unique opportunity to study the spread of an invasive animal from the start of the invasion process. Thus the Harlequin Ladybird Survey was launched in early 2005 as one of the first online wildlife surveys in the UK. Over 26,000 online records have been received, enabling a study of unprecedented detail. Mike was very adept at using the media to convey his message. His expertise extended to the Lepidoptera (including evolutionary studies of the peppered moth Biston betularia) and presidency of the Amateur Entomologists' Society, enabling further outreach opportunities.",,0
628,Interactions between bivalves and zooplankton: competition or intraguild predation? Implications for biomanipulation in subtropical shallow lakes,"Zooplankton and bivalves are the main consumers of phytoplankton in shallow lakes; however, knowledge regarding trophic interactions between them is scarce. Competition for resources appears to be an obvious direct interaction, but the scheme may be more complex. Bivalves can consume all or only part of the zooplankton, constituting an intraguild predation module. In the present study we investigated the interaction between bivalves and zooplankton and its effects on phytoplankton grazing and community structure using an experimental approach in an aquarium. Two bivalve species were considered, namely Diplodon parallelopipedon (native) and Corbicula fluminea (non-native), in addition to a natural zooplankton community dominated by small-sized zooplankton. The findings indicate that phytoplankton consumption by the zooplankton is substantially less than that by the bivalves. Under the experimental conditions, the bivalves actively consumed small-sized zooplankton (rotifers and nauplii), but no consumption of medium-sized individuals (cladocerans and copepods) was observed. The differential consumption may have implications on the size and structure of zooplankton, favouring an average larger-sized community. Thus, phytoplankton may be negatively affected both directly by consumption and indirectly because of the resulting structure of the zooplankton community. The main results of the study are also discussed from the perspective of biomanipulation techniques in tropical and subtropical regions.",https://doi.org/10.1071/mf15454,0
629,Response of Coccinellid Larvae to Conspecific and Heterospecific Larval Tracks: A Mechanism That Reduces Cannibalism and Intraguild Predation,"Cannibalism, where one species feeds on individuals of its own species, and intraguild predation (IGP), where a predator feeds on other predatory species, can both pose significant threats to natural enemies and interfere with their biological control of pests. Behavioral mechanisms to avoid these threats, however, could help maintain superior pest control. Here, we ask whether larvae of Coccinella septempunctata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) respond to larval tracks deposited by the other and whether this behavioral response reduces the threat of cannibalism and IGP. In petri dish experiments, we show that both H. axyridis and C. septempunctata avoid foraging in areas with conspecific larval tracks. Using a method of preventing larvae from depositing tracks, we then demonstrate that the frequency of cannibalism is greater for both species when larvae are prevented from depositing tracks compared with when the tracks are deposited. For multi-species interactions we show in petri dish experiments that C. septempunctata avoids H. axyridis larval tracks but H. axyridis does not avoid C. septempunctata larval tracks, demonstrating an asymmetry in response to larval tracks that parallels the asymmetry in aggressiveness between these species as intraguild predators. On single plants, we show that the presence of H. axyridis larval tracks reduces the risk of IGP by H. axyridis on C. septempunctata. Our study suggests that larval tracks can be used in more ways than previously described, in this case by changing coccinellid larval behavior in a way that reduces cannibalism and IGP.",https://doi.org/10.1603/en10211,0
630,Stabilizing effect of intra-specific competition on prey-predator dynamics with intraguild predation,"Multi-species population models with various types of interactions are important to understand the stable coexistence of prey and predator species and the role of various factors leading to complex dynamics and extinction of one or more species. Models of two predators sharing one prey population are analyzed by some researchers and the role of nonlinear functional responses and interaction strengths are reported to be responsible for the stable coexistence of three species. However, one-prey-two-predator models with intraguild predation have received relatively less attention from researchers. Recent literature on this topic mainly focused on the study of local and global stability properties of possible equilibria and appearance of various types of bifurcations. Intra-specific competition among predator species is an important factor for coexistence of more than one predator species competing for one shared prey. Hence it is quite essential to understand the role of intra-specific competition on the stability and bifurcation behavior. In this work we wish to demonstrate the stabilizing role of intra-specific competition among intermediate and top predators when the growth rate of prey species is adequate to support both the predator species. With the help of stability and bifurcation analysis we show the stabilizing role of intra-specific competition among predators. Moreover, strong self-regulation in intraguild predator prevents extinction of intraguild prey at high productivity and resolve the contradiction between empirical and previous theoretical results on the fate of intraguild prey at high productivity. To establish our claim we present, apart from analytical results, extensive numerical simulation results and couple of bifurcation diagrams.",https://doi.org/10.1051/mmnp/2018033,0
631,"Intraguild predation on<i>Eretmocerus</i>sp. nr.<i>emiratus</i>, a parasitoid of<i>Bemisia tabaci</i>, by three generalist predators with implications for estimating the level and impact of parasitism","Abstract Intraguild predation (IGP) is pervasive in many managed and unmanaged ecosystems and may have negative, neutral or positive effects on the biological control of pest insects. Both generalist predators and aphelinid parasitoids attack Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) Biotype B (=B. argentifolii Perring & Bellows) on cotton in the southwestern USA. Free-choice and no-choice laboratory assays were conducted to quantify prey consumption patterns and preference by three representative generalist predators, Geocoris punctipes (Say), Orius insidiosus (Say), and Hippodamia convergens Guérin-Méneville, offered fourth instar B. tabaci nymphs and nymphs parasitized by Eretmocerus sp. nr. emiratus. All three predators showed a significant preference for larval and pupal stage parasitoids over early fourth instar nymphs, but G. punctipes and O. insidiosus were non-discriminating when offered a choice of larval parasitoids and late fourth instar nymphs. The potential implications of these observed patterns for the field were examined through sensitivity analyses of existing field life table data. First, preference for parasitized hosts alters the methods required for calculating marginal rates of parasitism. Incorporating a preference variable in the estimation procedure had a very small positive effect (0.02–1.13% change) on total generational mortalities observed in previous life table studies. However, further hypothetical analyses suggested that under circumstances of lower generational mortality and higher levels of either apparent parasitism or predation, high levels of predator preference for parasitized prey could alter estimates of total mortality as much as 14%. Second, although intraguild predation was demonstrated, the implications for biological control are unclear. Based on field life table data the rate of IGP ranged from 0.019 to 0.126 depending on predator species and prey comparison, but accounting for these levels of IGP had only small negative effects on total generational mortalities (0.193–1.278% change).",https://doi.org/10.1080/09583150701408816,0
632,"Comparative population structure, abundance and vertical distribution of six copepod species in the North Atlantic: Evidence for intraguild predation?","Abstract The abundance, vertical distribution and stage composition of the copepods Euchaeta norvegica, Metridia lucens and Pleuromamma robusta and the abundance and vertical distribution of Acartia sp., Oithona spp. and Oncaea sp. were analysed for a period of 4.5 years (1971–1974), based on data previously collected at weather station India in the North Atlantic (59°N, 19°W). The results were compared with previously published results on Calanus finmarchicus during the same study. The factor analysis showed two well-differentiated groups. The cohort development and abundance of C. finmarchicus, E. norvegica and Oncaea were related to successive phytoplankton blooms. On the contrary, the cohort development and abundance of M. lucens, P. robusta, Acartia spp. and Oithona spp. were not related to phytoplankton concentration and showed negative relationships with Calanus abundance. We suggest that C. finmarchicus, which largely dominates the biomass at station India, could play a key role in the structuring of the community: as prey for the carnivorous E. norvegica, vectoring the spring bloom to deep waters through faecal pellet consumption by the coprophagous Oncaea spp., and through intraguild predation on the early stages of other omnivorous copepods such as Acartia, Oithona, M. lucens and P. robusta.",https://doi.org/10.1080/17451000600865321,0
633,Impacts of Intraguild Predation on Arctic Copepod Communities,"Communities of large copepods form an essential hub of matter and energy fluxes in Arctic marine food webs. Intraguild predation on eggs and early larval stages occurs among the different species of those communities and it has been hypothesized to impact its structure and function. In order to better understand the interactions between dominant copepod species in the Arctic, we conducted laboratory experiments that quantified intraguild predation between the conspicuous and omnivorous Metridia longa and the dominant Calanus hyperboreus. We recorded individual egg ingestion rates for several conditions of temperature, egg concentration and alternative food presence. In each of these experiments, at least some females ingested eggs but individual ingestion rates were highly variable. The global mean ingestion rate of M. longa on C. hyperboreus eggs was 5.8 eggs ind-1 d-1, or an estimated 37% of M. longa daily metabolic need. Among the different factors tested and the various individual traits considered (prosome length, condition index), only the egg concentration had a significant and positive effect on ingestion rates. We further explored the potential ecological impacts of intraguild predation in a simple 1D numerical model of C. hyperboreus eggs vertical distribution in the Amundsen Gulf. Our modelling results showed an asymmetric relationship in that M. longa has little potential impact on the recruitment of C. hyperboreus (< 3% egg standing stock removed by IGP at most) whereas the eggs intercepted by the former can account for a significant portion of its metabolic requirement during winter (up to a third).",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2016.00185,0
634,Intraguild Predation of Hippodamia variegata on Aphid Mummies in Cotton Field,"Intraguild predation among arthropod predators in agricultural ecosystems may have a negative impact on biological control. At present, there are few direct reports on trophic relationships among participants of predation in field groups. In this study, we measured the feeding choices of Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) towards mummies with different densities of Aphis gossypii Glover. The dynamics of the occurrence of mummies in the cotton field were investigated over 2017–2019. Singleplex PCR and multiplex PCR were used to detect the predation of 2090 H. variegata individuals on aphids and mummies in Xinjiang cotton field, which revealed the intraguild predation frequency between H. variegata and various parasitoids. There was no obvious feeding preference of H. variegata towards live aphids or mummies, which mainly depended on the relative density of prey. Among the four species of aphids detected in H. variegata, A. gossypii had a high detection rate and was the main prey source of the ladybeetle in the cotton filed. Mostly, ladybeetles consumed parasitoids through mummies, with 6.39% directly feeding on adult parasitoids. H. variegata had strong trophic links to both parasitoids and aphids. We established a food web of aphids–primary parasitoids–hyperparasitoids–H. variegata, which can be used to evaluate the pest control ability of H. variegata from a new perspective.",https://doi.org/10.3390/insects14010081,0
635,"Intraguild predation and competitive displacement between <i>Nesidiocoris tenuis</i> and <i>Dicyphus maroccanus</i>, two biological control agents in tomato pests","Dicyphus maroccanus Wagner and Nesidiocoris tenuis Reuter (Hemiptera: Miridae) are 2 biological control agents in tomatoes. Through the crop seasons, a natural shift in the occurrence of both mirids in favor of N. tenuis has been observed at the end of the cropping cycle in eastern Spain. To better optimize their conservation, the reasons for the observed change, such as intraguild interactions (IGP) or the influence of environmental conditions, are worth elucidating. To do this, we first studied the IGP of adult females on heterospecific nymphs in the laboratory. We next studied exploitative competition between adults and nymphs of each species when feeding on Ephestia kueniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) eggs in the laboratory. Finally, to analyze the competitive displacement between both mirids, we conducted a semifield experiment in which both predators were released together. All experiments were conducted at 2 temperature regimes (20 and 25°C). Adult-to-nymph intraguild interactions occurred only at 25 ºC at very low levels, showing that N. tenuis attacked and consumed a greater proportion of heterospecific nymphs. Nesidiocoris tenuis was a better competitor than D. maroccanus when feeding on the shared prey in the presence of its heterospecific nymph at 25 ºC. In semifield conditions, N. tenuis showed a competitive advantage over D. maroccanus at both temperatures. We conclude that there is not direct interference between both species, however, N. tenuis has a greater ability to outcompete, since it is best adapted to higher temperatures and it is able to remove food sources for D. maroccanus.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1744-7917.12361,0
636,The Ecological Significance and Incidence of Intraguild Predation and Cannibalism among Anurans in Ephemeral Tropical Pools,"Ephemeral pools are traditionally considered to be tadpole refuges, with few or no predators. While it is recognized that some tadpoles are predaceous, little attention has been given to understanding how tadpoles shape age and size structures of populations and the composition of tadpole assemblages. I examined the incidence of intraguild predation (IGP) among three species that co-occur in ephemeral pools in the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica. I found a high incidence of IGP among the three species, with IG predators differing in their voracity for prey eggs and IG prey differing in their vulnerability to IGP. I also examined the factors that influence the intensity of cannibalism and tadpole performance in a model species, Smilisca phaeota. I manipulated predator and prey size and developmental stage, tadpole density, food quantity, and tadpole relatedness in microcosm experiments. Cannibalism in S. phaeota was dependent on tadpole predator and prey size and developmental stage, with medium and large tadpoles causing almost complete mortality of embryos, but little mortality of mobile hatchlings. In contrast, predation by small tadpoles was restricted primarily to the embryo developmental stage. Tadpole mortality was high in low plant food quantity treatments, suggesting a high incidence of cannibalism. Other measures of tadpole performance, including survival to metamorphosis, metamorph mass, and larval period, were influenced by tadpole density and plant food quantity. Additions of conspecific prey eggs and degree of tadpole relatedness did not affect tadpole performance. My results suggest that tadpoles are capable of playing a regulatory role, influencing the relative abundance and composition of species in pools through differential IGP and cannibalism on eggs and hatchlings. The intensity of IGP in ephemeral pools is likely influenced by the morphology of IG predators, reproductive mode and fecundity of IG prey, and priority effects. My study supports the view that we need to reconsider the position tadpoles occupy within the aquatic food webs, with greater appreciation for their role as predators.",https://doi.org/10.1643/cp-08-114,0
637,Intraguild Predation Dynamics in a Lake Ecosystem Based on a Coupled Hydrodynamic-Ecological Model: The Example of Lake Kinneret (Israel),"The food web of Lake Kinneret contains intraguild predation (IGP). Predatory invertebrates and planktivorous fish both feed on herbivorous zooplankton, while the planktivorous fish also feed on the predatory invertebrates. In this study, a complex mechanistic hydrodynamic-ecological model, coupled to a bioenergetics-based fish population model (DYCD-FISH), was employed with the aim of revealing IGP dynamics. The results indicate that the predation pressure of predatory zooplankton on herbivorous zooplankton varies widely, depending on the season. At the time of its annual peak, it is 10-20 times higher than the fish predation pressure. When the number of fish was significantly higher, as occurs in the lake after atypical meteorological years, the effect was a shift from a bottom-up controlled ecosystem, to the top-down control of planktivorous fish and a significant reduction of predatory and herbivorous zooplankton biomass. Yet, seasonally, the decrease in predatory-zooplankton biomass was followed by a decrease in their predation pressure on herbivorous zooplankton, leading to an increase of herbivorous zooplankton biomass to an extent similar to the base level. The analysis demonstrates the emergence of non-equilibrium IGP dynamics due to intra-annual and inter-annual changes in the physico-chemical characteristics of the lake, and suggests that IGP dynamics should be considered in food web models in order to more accurately capture mass transfer and trophic interactions.",https://doi.org/10.3390/biology6020022,0
638,"Asymmetric intraguild predation of Harmonia axyridis (Pallas, 1773) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) on a native Coccinellidae guild","Harmonia axyridis is an exotic species that can cause serious impacts on native biodiversity in areas where it is introduced to act as a biological control agent. This predator is often involved with intraguild predation, in most cases with aphids predators. Here, we report the results of experiments designed to understand the outcome of the invasion of H. axyridis on native coccinellid aphidophagous guilds using intraguild predation as a theoretical framework. Tests were conducted to determine the interactions between 1st and 4th instars larvae and H. axyridis adults, with Cycloneda sanguinea, Cycloneda pulchella, Eriopis connexa and Hippodamia convergens larvae, as well as eggs predation rate. Two treatments were used: absence and presence of food, Cinara atlantica. The results showed that 1st and 4th instars larvae and H. axyridis adults are able to prey on larvae and eggs of four Coccinellidae species analyzed, and also their own eggs, showing that this exotic species is a dominant predator in this guild of aphidophagous coccinellids. Adding to these results, studies are recommended, especially the monitoring of these species in the field in the long run, reporting their abundance and diversity as well as their behavior and impact within aphidophagous guilds, especially in Coccinellidae species.",https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9665-rbent-2019-69,0
639,Predator water balance alters intraguild predation in a streamside food web,"Previous work suggests that animal water balance can influence trophic interactions, with predators increasing their consumption of water-laden prey to meet water demands. But it is unclear how the need for water interacts with the need for energy to drive trophic interactions under shifting conditions. Using manipulative field experiments, we show that water balance influences the effects of top predators on prey with contrasting ratios of water and energy, altering the frequency of intraguild predation. Water-stressed top predators (large spiders) negatively affect water-laden basal prey (crickets), especially male prey with higher water content, whereas alleviation of water limitation causes top predators to switch to negatively affecting energy-rich midlevel predators (small spiders). Thus, the relative water and energy content of multiple prey, combined with the water demand of the top predator, influences trophic interactions in ways that can alter the strength of intraguild predation. These findings underscore the need for integration of multiresource approaches for understanding implications of global change for food webs.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2635,0
640,Two protagonists on aphidophagous patches: effects of learning and intraguild predation,"Abstract In aphidophagous systems, trophic interactions between parasitoids and predators, termed intraguild predation, are frequently asymmetric. To mitigate predation risk for themselves and their offspring, intraguild prey may exploit associative learning to gain accurate information about patch quality. Therefore, costs of unnecessary escape behavior are avoided. We used sweet pepper patches ( Capsicum annuum L., cv. ‘Mazurka’) (Solanaceae), sustaining Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas) or Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Homoptera: Aphididae) aphids, as a model system to quantify the foraging behaviors of the parasitoid Aphelinus abdominalis (Dalman) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), when confronted with predatory second instar Chrysopa carnea (Stephens) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae). The behavior of predator‐naive or predator‐experienced A. abdominalis foraging in a patch with or without C. carnea was recorded and analyzed using a multiple video observation system. We investigated (i) whether A. abdominalis could learn to detect the presence of a predator in a patch, (ii) the impact of the predator presence on the learning and motor learning of the parasitoid, and (iii) the effects of the aphid species on the guild interactions. Results showed that the presence of, or experience with the predator does not affect A. abdominalis learning or motor learning. We discuss the behavioral and ecological implications of our finding. Overall, predator‐induced aphid mobility increased the frequency and allocation time of Aphelinus oviposition activities, especially when Ma . euphorbiae was the host. The predator imposed indirect fitness costs on the parasitoid. Aphelinus abdominalis searched more often and longer, resulting in a tendency towards reduced Ma . euphorbiae parasitism rate in patches harboring C. carnea .",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2008.00676.x,0
641,Interactions between branchiate mole salamanders (Ambystoma talpoideum) and lesser sirens (Siren intermedia): asymmetrical competition and intraguild predation,"Abstract Using field sampling and experiments in natural and artificial ponds, I studied interactions between branchiate adult mole salamanders (Ambystoma talpoideum) and lesser sirens (Siren intermedia), two top predators in temporary ponds of the southeastern United States. The abundance and distribution of these two salamanders were independent among ponds, with A. talpoideum more numerous and widespread than S. intermedia. Both species were more likely to be found in ponds near other intermittent wetlands. Within a pond, captures of these two species were negatively correlated, and a field experiment showed that paedomorphic A. talpoideum avoided traps containing S. intermedia. An experiment in artificial ponds confirmed that interactions between these two species were highly asymmetrical; S. intermedia reduced the growth and recruitment of A. talpoideum without experiencing reciprocal. positive or negative effects. These results suggest that S. intermedia competes with and is an intraguild predator of A. talpoideum, limiting its growth and controlling its recruitment.",https://doi.org/10.1163/156853899x00141,0
642,Ontogenetic stage-specific reciprocal intraguild predation,"The size or stage of interacting individuals is known to affect the outcome of ecological interactions and can have important consequences for population dynamics. This is also true for intraguild predation (the killing and eating of potential competitors), where the size or ontogenetic stage of an individual determines whether it is the intraguild predator or the intraguild prey. Studying size- or stage-specific interactions is therefore important, but can be challenging in species with complex life histories. Here, we investigated predatory interactions of all feeding stages of the two predatory mite species Neoseiulus californicus and Phytoseiulus macropilis, both of which have complex life cycles, typical for predatory arthropods. Populations of these two species compete for two-spotted spider mites, their prey. We evaluated both the capacity to kill stages of the other predator species and the capacity to benefit from feeding on these stages, both prerequisites for the occurrence of intraguild predation. Ontogeny played a critical role in the occurrence of intraguild predation. Whereas the juveniles of P. macropilis developed from larva until adulthood when feeding on N. californicus eggs, interestingly, adult female P. macropilis did not feed on the smaller stages of the other species. We furthermore show that intraguild predation was reciprocal: both juveniles and adult females of N. californicus preyed on the smallest stages of P. macropilis. These results suggest that a proper analysis of the interactions between pairs of species involved in intraguild predation should start with an inventory of the interactions among all ontogenetic stages of these species.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-018-4256-6,0
643,Differential physico-chemical tolerances and intraguild predation among native and invasive amphipods (Crustacea); a field study,"We used field surveys and transplant experiments to elucidate the relative roles of physico-chemical regime and intraguild predation in determining the generally mutually exclusive distributions of native and invader freshwater amphipod species. Field surveys showed that the native Gammarus duebeni celticus dominates the shoreline of Lough Neagh, N. Ireland, with some co-occurrence with the N. American invader G. tigrinus. However, the latter species dominates the deeper areas of the mid-Lough. Transplant experiments showed no difference in survival of the native and invader in single species 'bioassay tubes' placed along the shoreline. However, there was significantly higher survival of the invader compared with the native in single species tubes placed in the mid-Lough. In mixed species tubes on the shoreline, the native killed and ate the invader, with no reciprocal interaction, leading to significant reductions of the invader. However, the invader had significantly higher survival than the native in mixed species tubes in the mid-Lough, with no evidence of predation between the two species. These results indicate that, whereas differential intraguild predation may determine domination of the shoreline by the native, differential physico-chemical tolerances may be major determinants of the domination of the mid-Lough by the invader. This study emphasises the need to consider the habitat template in conjunction with biotic interactions before attempting to draw conclusions about mechanisms determining relative distribution patterns of native and invasive species.",https://doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0156-0165,0
644,"Cannibalism and intraguild predation involved in the intra- and inter-specific interactions of the invasive fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, and lepidopteran maize stemborers","Abstract Cannibalism and intraguild predation can play important roles in determining spread and survival or death of organisms which share the same resource. However, the relationship between cannibalism and intraguild predation, and the costs and benefits of such behaviours, is difficult to establish within insect communities, and little is known about how such behaviours are affected by invasive species. The present study was aimed at assessing the interactions between larvae of fall armyworm ( Spodoptera frugiperda ) and maize stemborers (native to Africa, Busseola fusca , and Sesamia calamistis and native to India, Chilo partellus ) in relation to cannibalism and intraguild predation when they utilize the same resource. Experiments involving treatments with either single species of S. frugiperda or any of the stemborers or pairwise species combinations with S. frugiperda were conducted under laboratory conditions. The experimental insect larvae were reared on maize leaves and monitored until the last developmental stage where cannibalism and/or intraguild predation, larval survival, and relative growth rate were recorded. Results of the intraspecific interaction indicated that S. frugiperda exhibited cannibalism to a larger degree than the stemborers species, especially at the late instars. The higher cannibalism trait in S. frugiperda turned, however, to competitive advantage as it led to a higher degree of intraguild predation when they cohabit with stemborer species and allowed FAW to gain a greater relative growth rate. Overall, interactions with FAW are detrimental for stemborer species and may be an important factor to explain the invasive success of S. frugiperda . Such knowledge is essential to understand the mechanisms behind ecological interactions between pests with overlapping niches in the field and in designing successful integrated pest management strategies.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10340-022-01572-7,0
645,Environmental constraint of intraguild predation: Inorganic turbidity modulates omnivory in fairy shrimps,"Abstract Omnivory is widespread in food webs, with an important stabilising effect. The strength of omnivorous trophic interactions may change considerably with changes in the local environment. Shallow temporary waters are often characterised by high levels of inorganic turbidity that may directly limit the food uptake of filter‐feeding organisms, but there is little evidence on how it might affect omnivorous species. Anostracans are key species of temporary waters and recent evidence suggests that these organisms are omnivorous consumers of both phyto‐ and zooplankton. Using Branchinecta orientalis as a model species, our aim was to test how turbidity affects the feeding of an omnivorous anostracan. To do this, we used short‐term feeding experiments and stable isotope analyses, with animals collected from soda pans in eastern Austria. In the feeding experiments, algae and zooplankton were offered as food either separately or in combination. The prey type treatments were crossed with turbidity levels in a factorial design. There was a pronounced decrease in the ingested algal biomass with increasing turbidity. Conversely, ingestion rates on zooplankton were less affected by turbidity. Stable isotope analyses from field material supported our experimental results by showing a positive relationship of the trophic position of anostracans and the trophic niche of the communities with turbidity. Our results show that turbidity modulates the intraguild trophic relationship between anostracans and their prey by shifting the diet of anostracans from more herbivorous in transparent to more carnivorous in turbid waters. Thus, inorganic turbidity might also have a community‐shaping role in plankton communities of temporary waters through altering trophic relationships.",https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13416,0
646,Impact of Additive Allee Effect on the Dynamics of an Intraguild Predation Model with Specialist Predator,"Many important factors in ecological communities are related to the interplay between predation and competition. Intraguild predation or IGP is a mixture of predation and competition which is a very basic three-dimensional system in food webs where two species are related to predator–prey relationship and are also competing for a shared prey. On the other hand, Allee effect is also a very important ecological factor which causes significant changes to the system dynamics. In this work, we consider a intraguild predation model in which predator is specialist, the growth of shared prey population is subjected to additive Allee effect and there is Holling-Type III functional response between IG prey and IG predator. We analyze the impact of Allee effect on the global dynamics of the system with the prior knowledge of the dynamics of the model without Allee effect. Our theoretical and numerical analyses suggest that: (1) Trivial equilibrium point is always locally asymptotically stable and it may be globally stable also. Hence, all the populations may go to extinction depending upon initial conditions; (2) Bistability is observed between unique interior equilibrium point and trivial equilibrium point or between boundary equilibrium point and trivial equilibrium point; (3) Multiple interior equilibrium points exist under certain parameters range. We also provide here a comprehensive study of bifurcation analysis by considering Allee effect as one of the bifurcation parameters. We observed that Allee effect can generate all possible bifurcations such as transcritical bifurcation, saddle-node bifurcation, Hopf bifurcation, Bogdanov–Taken bifurcation and Bautin bifurcation. Finally, we compared our model with the IGP model without Allee effect for better understanding the impact of Allee effect on the system dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1142/s0218127420502399,0
647,Asymmetrical intraguild predation between natural enemies of the citrus mealybug,"Abstract The ability of a predator to discriminate against parasitized prey determines the extent of asymmetrical intraguild predation, which is often crucial for the outcome of biological control. A nagyrus nr. pseudococci ( G irault) ( H ymenoptera: E ncyrtidae), a parasitoid of the citrus mealybug, P lanococcus citri ( R isso) ( H emiptera: P seudococcidae), suffers from intraguild predation by coccinellids occurring in the same habitat. The level of intraguild predation on A . nr. pseudococci by N ephus includens ( K irsch) ( C oleoptera: C occinellidae) at different immature stages has been investigated with and without simultaneous offer of extraguild prey. Larvae of A . nr. pseudococci appeared to face increased intraguild predation at early developmental stages, whereas mummification provided adequate protection against the predatory coccinellid. Different predation levels on unparasitized vs. parasitized hosts at various developmental stages in choice assays indicated that N . includens preferences might be determined not solely by palatability of the prey but also by its ability to protect itself.",https://doi.org/10.1111/eea.12175,0
648,Foraging behaviour of the parasitoid <i>Eretmocerus eremicus</i> under intraguild predation risk by <i>Macrolophus pygmaeus</i>,"Abstract BACKGROUND Intraguild predation ( IGP ), predation between species that use a common resource, can affect the populations of a pest, of the pest's natural enemy ( IG prey) and of the predator of the pest's natural enemy ( IG predator). In this study, we determined whether the parasitoid Eretmocerus eremicus (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) ( IG prey), modifies its foraging behaviour under the risk of IGP by Macrolophus pygmaeus (Hemiptera: Miridae) ( IG predator). Parasitoid behaviour was analysed using two bioassays (choice and no‐choice) with the following treatments: (i) control, tomato leaf infested with whitefly nymphs; and (ii) PEP , tomato leaf infested with whitefly nymphs and previously exposed to the IG predator; and (iii) PP , tomato leaf infested with whitefly nymphs, with both, the IG predator and the IG prey present. RESULTS In both bioassays, we found that E. eremicus did not significantly modify the number of ovipositions, time of residence, duration of oviposition or behavioural sequence. However, in the no‐choice bioassay, the number of attacks was higher and their duration shorter in the PEP treatment than in the control. CONCLUSION Our results indicate that the parasitoid may detect IGP risk to a certain extent, but it did not significantly modify its foraging behaviour, suggesting that simultaneous release of the two natural enemies can be successfully employed. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry",https://doi.org/10.1002/ps.3938,0
649,Reciprocal Intraguild Predation between<i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>(American Alligator) and Elasmobranchii in the Southeastern United States,"The food habits and predatory interactions of Alligator mississippiensis (American Alligator) have been thoroughly studied within populations inhabiting inland freshwater ecosystems; however, it is increasingly evident that coastal populations habitually forage in estuarine and nearshore marine ecosystems inhabited by other top predators. While few studies have been performed, data reported thus far from marine-foraging populations indicate individuals chiefly consume small-bodied prey such as crustaceans, fish, and wading birds. Nonetheless, capture and consumption of large-bodied marine prey such as multiple species of sea turtles and a single species of Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays) have been documented. Here, we examine evidence regarding reciprocal intraguild predation between American Alligators and elasmobranchs. We provide the first evidence of American Alligator depredation of 4 Elasmobranchii species and review putative evidence for Elasmobranchii depredation of American Alligators. We discuss the ecological significance of these interactions, draw comparisons to similar interactions experienced by other crocodilians, and recommend further avenues for research on the subject.",https://doi.org/10.1656/058.016.0306,0
650,Influence of density on intraguild predation of aquatic Hemiptera (Heteroptera): implications in biological control of mosquito,"The water bugs &lt;em&gt;Diplonychus rusticus&lt;/em&gt; (Fabricius) (Heteroptera: Belostomatidae) and &lt;em&gt;Anisops bouvieri&lt;/em&gt; (Kirkaldy) (Heteroptera: Notonectidae) co-occur in wetlands sharing mosquito larvae as prey. As a consequence, an asymmetrical intraguild predation (IGP) involving D. rusticus as IG predator and &lt;em&gt;A. bouvieri&lt;/em&gt; as IG prey can be possible, the outcome of which may vary with the relative density of interacting species. Based on this proposition density dependent effects on the IG prey and shared prey mortality were assessed in the laboratory using varying numbers of IG predator and shared prey (IV instar &lt;em&gt;Culex quinquefasciatus&lt;/em&gt; larva). In contrast to single predator system, mosquito larvae were proportionately less vulnerable to predation in IGP, at low density of shared prey. An increase in density of mosquito decreased the mortality of IG prey (&lt;em&gt;A. bouvieri&lt;/em&gt;), but the mean mortality of the IG prey increased with the density of IG predator, in IGP system. Increase in density of mosquito and &lt;em&gt;D. rusticus&lt;/em&gt; enhanced risk to predation of mosquito while reducing the mortality of &lt;em&gt;A. bouvieri&lt;/em&gt;. Interaction between &lt;em&gt;D.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;rusticus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A. bouvieri&lt;/em&gt; as a part of IGP system provides a possible reason of coexistence of mosquito immature along with predators in wetlands. Biological regulation of mosquitoes may be affected, if appropriate predator numbers are not available in the habitats.",https://doi.org/10.4081/jear.2014.1977,0
651,Behavioral interactions between terrestrial salamanders and spiders: competition or intraguild predation?,"Several studies suggest that small terrestrial salamanders are important regulators of leaf litter arthropod communities, and likely contribute to ecosystem processes such as decomposition and nutrient cycling. Despite the recognition that salamanders have the potential to strongly affect ecosystem function through both direct and indirect pathways, little is known regarding the nature of interactions between small vertebrates and the large, predatory arthropods with which they share both microhabitat and prey. Our study was designed to explore interactions between Eastern Red-backed Salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, and spiders in the genus Wadotes in an eastern North American temperate forest ecosystem. We were particularly interested in teasing apart behaviors such as territoriality and intraguild predation in an attempt to determine specifically which interaction is most likely responsible for the observed negative relationship between salamander and spider abundance at our field site. Field data indicate that P. cinereus and large syntopic spiders exhibit negative spatial associations in the microhabitat beneath cover objects, a possible indication of interspecific territoriality. In our laboratory experiments, resident salamanders displayed agonistic postures similarly toward both intruding conspecifics and spiders, suggesting that salamanders may perceive large intruding spiders as competitors. Finally, we observed no injuries to individual P. cinereus or adult spiders even though occasional chases and bites by both were recorded during the behavioral trials. We found no evidence that adults or juveniles of P. cinereus were envenomated by adult Wadotes spp., and there were no instances of intraguild predation in this study. Multiple lines of evidence from this study, and others, suggest that the primary interaction between individuals of P. cinereus and large spiders is competitive in nature rather than predatory. We suggest that the cost associated with intraguild predation on salamanders with noxious skin secretions may preclude them from being preyed upon by spiders.",https://doi.org/10.1080/03949370.2017.1370615,0
652,Intraguild predation is increased in areas of low prey diversity in a generalist predator community,"Niche differentiation and intraguild predation (IGP) can allow ecologically similar species to coexist, although it is unclear which coexistence mechanism predominates in consumer communities. Until now, a limited ability to quantify diets from metabarcoding data has precluded the use of sequencing data to determine the relative importance of these mechanisms. Here, we pair a recent metabarcoding quantification approach with stable isotope analysis to examine diet composition in a wolf spider community. We compare the prevalence of resource partitioning and IGP in these spiders and test whether factors that influence foraging performance, including individual identity, morphology, prey community and environmental conditions, can explain variation in diet composition and IGP. Extensive IGP is likely the primary coexistence mechanism in this community, and other factors to which foraging variation is often attributed do not explain diet composition and IGP here. Rather, IGP increases as prey diversity decreases. Foragers are driven to IGP where resource niches are limited. We highlight the need to examine how drivers of predator-prey interaction strengths translate into foraging in natural systems.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13901,0
653,Pulsed supplies of small fish facilitate time-limited intraguild predation in salmon-stocked streams,"Pulsed supplies of prey generally increase predator food intake. However, it is unclear whether this holds true when predators and pulsed prey are in the same guild (i.e. intraguild (IG) predators and prey). IG prey may increase IG-predator food intake through predation, but they may decrease food intake through competition. To test these hypotheses, we compared the food intake of white-spotted charr (Salvelinus leucomaenis) (IG predator) in streams that were stocked or unstocked with masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) fry (IG prey) in streams in Hokkaido, Japan. One day after stocking, mean stomach content weight of charr was six times higher than in unstocked streams due to fry consumption. In particular, large charr showed intense piscivory. However, predation on fry was rare after about three weeks. Some factors that could explain this time-limited IG predation include the growth and decreasing abundance of fry over time and the acquisition of predator-avoidance behaviour. In days other than the first-day post-stocking, food intake by charr did not differ between stocked and unstocked streams. No effects of interspecific competition on charr food intake were observed.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.220127,0
654,Food web structure and intraguild predation affect ecosystem functioning in an established plankton model,"Abstract Understanding how marine microbial food webs and their ecosystem functions are changing is crucial for projections of the future ocean. Often, simplified food web models are employed and their solutions are only evaluated against available observations of plankton biomass. With such an approach, it remains unclear how different underlying trophic interactions affect interpretations of plankton dynamics and functioning. Here, we quantitatively compare four hypothetical food webs to data from an existing mesocosm experiment using a refined version of the Minimum Microbial Food Web model. Food web representations range from separated food chains to complex food webs featuring additional trophic links including intraguild predation (IGP). Optimization against observations and taking into account model complexity ensures a fair comparison of the different food webs. Although the different optimized model food webs capture the observations similarly well, projected ecosystem functions differ depending on the underlying food web structure and the presence or absence of IGP. Mesh‐like food webs dominated by the microbial loop yield higher recycling and net primary production (NPP) than models dominated by the classical diatom‐copepod food chain. A high degree of microzooplankton IGP increases NPP and organic matter recycling, but decreases trophic transfer efficiency (TTE) to copepods. Copepod production, the trophic role of copepods, and TTE are more sensitive to initial biomass changes in chain‐like than in complex food webs. Measurements resolving trophic interactions, in particular those quantifying IGP, remain essential to reduce model uncertainty and allow sound conclusions for ecosystem functioning in plankton ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.12039,0
655,Direct and indirect effect of cannibalism and intraguild predation in the two sibling <i>Harmonia</i> ladybird beetles,"Abstract In this study, we focused on the direct (i.e., predation) and indirect (i.e., potential threat from coexisting with a larger individual) effects of cannibalism and intraguild predation (IGP) during larval stages of two sibling ladybird beetles. These effects play an important role in the coexistence of the generalist–common Harmonia axyridis and specialist–rare H. yedoensis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). Direct predation effect of cannibalism and IGP was asymmetric in the two sibling ladybird beetles; the fourth instar larvae of H . axyridis were better intraguild predators than cannibals, while the reverse was true in the larvae of H. yedoensis . Neither cannibalism nor IGP significantly affected female body weight in either species. Larval H . axyridis surviving exposure to cannibalism or IGP had a reduced number of ovarioles as adults, whereas adult H. yedoensis ovarioles were not affected. For the indirect effects, longer developmental times in males and females and a lower total number of ovarioles in females were detected in H . axyridis . In H. yedoensis , shorter developmental time of males, lighter adult weight and fewer total ovarioles in females were observed. Olfactometer choice experiments clarified that the fourth instar larvae of H . axyridis avoided the first instar conspecific larvae, while those of H. yedoensis were attracted to the odors from H . axyridis and conspecifics. Thus, H . axyridis has an avoidance mechanism only for cannibalism but not for IGP , whereas H. yedoensis does not have any avoidance mechanism. These different behaviors in the direct and indirect effects of cannibalism and IGP observed in the laboratory may play important roles in the coexistence of generalist–common H . axyridis and specialist–rare H. yedoensis in natural conditions, compensating for the large handicap of H. yedoensis at reproductive interference from H . axyridis .",https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.6326,0
656,Effects of intraguild predation and interspecific competititon among biological control agents in augmentative biological control in greenhouses.,"Two natural enemy species are frequently released simultaneously to control one pest species in augmentative biological control in greenhouses. Intraguild predation (IGP) and interspecific competition between natural enemies might affect the biological control. IGP occurs between two parasitoids, between one parasitoid and one predator, and between two predators. Although unidirectional IGP has been found in many studies about IGP between natural enemies used in the biological control of greenhouse pests, no significant effects of IGP on biological control have been recognized. On tomatoes in greenhouses, Liriomyza trifolii is usually controlled by the combined release of Dacnusa sibirica and Diglyphus isaea. Trialeurodes vaporariorum, another pest of greenhouse tomatoes, can be controlled by the combined use of Encarsia formosa and Eretmocerus eremicus. Simulation models incorporating IGP or interspecific competition between these parasitoid species have been constructed for evaluating biological control using two parasitoid species. These simulation models suggested no significant negative effects of IGP or interspecific interactions between two parasitoids on biological control.",,0
657,Seasonal and spatial variability of Atlanto-Iberian pelagic fish diet with estimates of intraguild predation,"The diets of 3 of the most abundant coastal pelagic fish species in the eastern Atlantic (sardine, anchovy and Atlantic chub mackerel) were investigated, including seasonal, geographical and ontogenetic variability of the diets. We also estimated the impact of cannibalism and intraguild predation on egg mortality, and a different method to evaluate egg mortality is proposed taking the spatial overlap of predators and eggs into account. Diet overlap occurred between the 3 pelagic species, which derive most of their dietary carbon from mesozooplankton prey. However, calanoid copepods were mostly important for anchovy and sardine, whereas the diet of the Atlantic chub mackerel also included crustacean eggs, nauplii, small copepodites and larger prey such as decapods. Sardine was the main predator of fish eggs (90% of all identified eggs), followed by Atlantic chub mackerel (8%) and anchovy (2%). Cannibalism by anchovies and sardines on their eggs was low (&lt;10% of spawned eggs) for all areas and seasons. The impact of sardine predation on anchovy egg mortality was high (71% of the anchovy eggs spawned per day during the spring off northwestern Iberia) and may explain why anchovy abundance has only peaked in recent years, when sardine abundance was at its lowest level, highlighting the importance of taking an ecosystem approach to fisheries management into account. However, species-specific data of gastric evacuation rates and feeding durations are needed to obtain more accurate estimates of the impact of cannibalism and intraguild predation on egg mortality.",https://doi.org/10.3354/meps14011,0
658,Intraguild Predation between Chrysoperla carnea (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) and Hippodamia variegata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) at Various Extraguild Prey Densities and Arena Complexities,"Intraguild predation (IGP) is a ubiquitous, important and common interaction that occurs in aphidophagous guilds. The effects of extraguild prey (EGP, i.e., aphids) density, predator life stage combinations and duration of the interaction on the level, asymmetry and direction of intraguild predation between lacewing Chrysoperla carnea and ladybird Hippodamia variegata were examined in simple laboratory arena and more complex microcosm environment. Three initial densities of 50, 150 and 400 Aphis fabae third instar nymphs and a control without aphids were provided to six combinations of predator life stages (2nd and 3rd larval instars of lacewing and 3rd and 4th instars and adult females of ladybird). The remaining aphid density and occurrence of IGP were checked after 24, 48 and 72 h. The IGP intensity (IGP level, IL) was similar in the simple arena (reaching 0.6 between larvae in absence of EGP and 0.3 between lacewing larvae and ladybird females) and microcosm environment (0.3 without EGP). In both environments, increasing EGP density lowered IL according to negative exponential relationship. IGP was asymmetric (general average asymmetry was 0.82 in simple arena and 0.93 in microcosm, the difference was not significant) and mostly in favour of larvae of C. carnea, except in the combination of 2nd larvae of C. carnea with the 4th larvae and adults of H. variegata. The direction of IGP, but not other characteristics, partially changed during the duration of the experiment. The incidence of IGP interactions among aphid predators under real conditions and its consequences on aphid biological control are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.3390/insects11050288,0
659,"Interaction between hunting strategy, habitat type and stratum drive intraguild predation and cannibalism","Intraguild predation (IGP) is a common interaction between generalist predators when they competitively exploit similar resources and prey on each other. Theoretical models predict limitations for intraguild predator coexistence unless some mechanisms, such as the utilization of alternative prey (i.e. trophic niche partitioning) and cannibalism, increase the relative intraspecific clustering and interspecific segregation. As hunting strategies determine trophic niches of predators and their own vulnerability to predation, the hunting strategies may also determine the relative importance of cannibalism, predation, and exploitative competition and consequently the intensity of IGP. The importance of hunting strategies on the potential outcome of IGP and how habitat properties modify the interaction between hunting strategies remain poorly understood. Using published data on spider prey of spider predators, we first investigated how predation of a top‐predator on a mesopredator is determined by the functional distance between both predators to understand how predation and exploitation are distributed in spider communities. Subsequently, we investigated the predation among spiders with particular hunting strategies to understand which strategies interact most frequently. We also investigated whether the interaction between hunting strategies was influenced by habitat type (forest, open (semi)natural habitat, agroecosystem) or by habitat stratum (ground versus vegetation). The hunting strategies of top‐predators and mesopredators interacted to determine the relative capture proportions of conspecifics and hetero‐specifics. This interaction was further modified by habitat type and stratum. Two mechanisms can reinforce coexistence in highly diverse spider communities. First, top‐predators preyed most frequently on functionally distinct mesopredators, which indicates the overall intensity of IGP may be relaxed by a balanced distribution between exploitative competition and predation. Second, cannibalism was common for top‐predators with a hunting strategy of frequently preying on functionally similar mesopredators. Cannibalism may lead to self‐limitation of top‐predator populations and may thereby facilitate coexistence between two predator species.",https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.08355,0
660,"Competition and intraguild predation between the braconid parasitoid<i>Bracon hylobii</i>and the entomopathogenic nematode<i>Heterorhabditis downesi</i>, natural enemies of the large pine weevil,<i>Hylobius abietis</i>","Abstract In biological control programmes introduced natural enemies compete with indigenous enemies for hosts and may also engage in intraguild predation when two species competing for the same prey attack and consume one another. The large pine weevil, Hylobius abietis L. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is an important pest of coniferous reforestation in Europe. Among its natural enemies, the parasitoid Bracon hylobii Ratz. (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and entomopathogenic nematodes have potential as biological control agents. Both parasitoid and nematodes target the weevil larvae and, hence, there is potential for competition or intraguild predation. In this study, we examine the interaction of B. hylobii with the nematode Heterorhabditis downesi Stock, Griffin and Burnell (Nematode: Heterorhabditidae), testing the susceptibility of larvae, pupae and adults of B. hylobii to H. downesi and whether female parasitoids discriminate between nematode-infected and uninfected weevils for oviposition. In choice tests, when weevils were exposed to nematodes 1–7 days previously, no B. hylobii oviposited on nematode-infected weevil larvae. Up to 24 h, healthy weevils were twice as likely as nematode-infected ones to be used for oviposition. Bracon hylobii females did not adjust clutch size; nematode-infected hosts were either rejected or the parasitoid laid a full clutch of eggs on them. When nematodes were applied to the parasitoid feeding on weevil larvae, the nematodes parasitized the parasitoid larvae, there was a reduction in cocoon formation and fewer cocoons eclosed. Eclosion rate was not reduced when nematodes were applied to fully formed cocoons, but nearly all of the emerging adults were killed by nematodes.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007485308006287,0
661,Intraguild predation of <i>Geocoris punctipes</i> on <i>Eretmocerus eremicus</i> and its influence on the control of the whitefly <i>Trialeurodes vaporariorum</i>,"Geocoris punctipes (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae) and Eretmocerus eremicus (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) are whitefly natural enemies. Previously, under laboratory conditions, we showed that G. punctipes engages in intraguild predation (IGP), the attack of one natural enemy by another, on E. eremicus. However, it is unknown whether this IGP interaction takes place under more complex scenarios, such as semi-field conditions. Even more importantly, the effect of this interaction on the density of the prey population requires investigation. Therefore, the present study aimed to establish whether this IGP takes place under semi-field conditions and to determine whether the predation rate of G. punctipes on the whitefly decreases when IGP takes place.Molecular analysis showed that, under semi-field conditions, G. punctipes performed IGP on E. eremicus. However, although IGP did take place, the predation rate by G. punctipes on the whitefly was nevertheless higher when both natural enemies were present together than when the predator was present alone.While IGP of G. punctipes on E. eremicus does occur under semi-field conditions, it does not adversely affect whitefly control.

662,Leaf pubescence mediates intraguild predation between predatory mites,"Plant morphological traits such as leaf pubescence may affect herbivores and their natural enemies at the individual, population and community levels. Leaf pubescence has been repeatedly shown to mediate predator-herbivore interactions whereas the influence of leaf pubescence on predator–predator interactions such as intraguild predation (IGP) has seldom been investigated. Using a three-pronged approach we assessed the influence of leaf pubescence on the predatory mites Kampimodromus aberrans and Euseius finlandicus. Both predators occur on broad-leaved trees in Europe. Euseius finlandicus is mostly found on trees with glabrous leaves whereas K. aberrans mainly occurs on trees with pubescent leaves. We hypothesized that leaf pubescence mediates IGP between K. aberrans and E. finlandicus and thereby determines their dominance and proportional abundance. A field survey on apple revealed that the abundance of K. aberrans and E. finlandicus is negatively correlated, with the former predominating on cultivars with strongly pubescent leaves and the latter predominating on cultivars with little pubescent or glabrous leaves. Microhabitat choice tests showed that K. aberrans preferentially resides on pubescent leaves whereas E. finlandicus preferentially resides on glabrous leaves. The effects of leaf pubescence on survival and development of immature IG predators and IG prey were reversed for K. aberrans and E. finlandicus. In the presence of the IG predator E. finlandicus, immature K. aberrans had higher survival probabilities on pubescent leaves than on glabrous ones. In contrast, the survival chances of immature E. finlandicus were higher on glabrous leaves than on pubescent ones when the IG predator K. aberrans was present. Artificial leaf pubescence enhanced IG prey capture by immature K. aberrans and prolonged their longevity but impaired IG prey capture by immature E. finlandicus and shortened their longevity. We conclude that leaf pubescence mediates IGP strength and symmetry and discuss the implications to natural and biological control.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15895.x,0
663,Intraguild predation and cannibalism among Dicyphini: <i>Dicyphus cerastii</i> vs. two commercialized species,"Abstract Dicyphine mirids are one of the most important groups of predators on tomato. In the Mediterranean region, several species in the genera Dicyphus , Macrolophus , and Nesidiocoris (Hemiptera: Miridae, Bryocorinae, Dicyphini) colonize protected horticultural crops. In Portugal, Nesidiocoris tenuis (Reuter) is increasingly abundant in the mirid species complex of tomato crops and appears to be displacing the native Dicyphus cerastii Wagner. In order to know whether intraguild predation (IGP) can explain the decreasing abundance of D. cerastii , we evaluated predatory interactions between adult females and first instars of D. cerastii vs. N. tenuis but also D. cerastii vs. Macrolophus pygmaeus (Rambur), as this species is also naturally present in horticultural crops in Portugal. Cannibalistic interactions were also tested for the same three species. All experiments were performed under laboratory conditions, in Petri dish arenas, in the presence or absence of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) eggs as alternative prey. Predation on both heterospecific and conspecific nymphs occurred only in the absence of alternative food. Intraguild predation was mutual and symmetrical between D. cerastii and M. pygmaeus . However, IGP was asymmetrical between D. cerastii and N. tenuis , favouring the first. Cannibalism was not significantly different among these mirid species. Our results show that D. cerastii has a greater capacity to feed on intraguild prey than N. tenuis . Therefore, IGP on small nymphs does not explain the abundance shift between D. cerastii and N. tenuis .",https://doi.org/10.1111/eea.12943,0
664,Seasonal Patterns of Intraguild Predation and Size Variation among Larval Salamanders in Ephemeral Ponds,"Predation among potential competitors, or intraguild predation (IGP), is dependent on size disparities between competing predators and prey and strongly influences the ecology of larval amphibians in ephemeral ponds. Although intraguild prey are hypothesized to exhibit faster growth rates than intraguild predators and, therefore, outgrow predation risk through time, intraguild predation also is associated with significant increases in predator growth rates that are hypothesized to increase the potential for future predation. Given these conflicting hypotheses, how predation among amphibian larvae early in development should influence size disparities and ontogenetic shifts in predation risk is unclear. To clarify the effects of intraguild predation on predator and prey growth, we quantified size variation among larval salamanders (Ambystomatidae) in forested ephemeral ponds while concurrently monitoring seasonal patterns of intraguild predation through gut content analyses. Intraguild predation had no discernible effect on either interspecific size disparities between intraguild predators and prey, or intraspecific size variation within predator populations, and factors of larval density, tadpole density, and pond area were more important than larval size variation in predicting IGP. Our results do not support previous assertions regarding the consequences of intraguild predation for predator–prey size disparities, because top predators not actively engaging in IGP appeared to maintain growth rates equivalent to successful conspecific IG predators, and the frequency of intraguild predation did not significantly change during larval ontogeny. The lack of consistent increases or decreases in predator–prey size disparities suggests that intraguild prey may not experience predictable ontogenetic shifts in intraguild predation risk.",https://doi.org/10.1670/15-029,0

However, the nature and consequence of trophic interactions between upper-trophic-level predators have received considerably less attention. This is especially the case in marine systems due to the inherent challenges of studying highly mobile marine species. Here we describe the first documentation of asymmetrical intraguild predation by a pinniped predator on a mid-sized predatory shark. The report is based on direct observations in South African waters, in which free-swimming blue sharks Prionace glauca were captured and partially consumed by Cape fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus. These observations are important not just for understanding the interactions between these two species but more broadly for their implications in understanding the trophic ecology of pinnipeds, many populations of which have increased while numerous shark populations have declined.",https://doi.org/10.2989/1814232x.2015.1013058,0
666,Intraguild predation between Harmonia axyridis and the hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus,"Whereas Harmonia axyridis has frequently been reported as an intraguild predator of other Coccinellidae, little is known about its interactions with other aphidophagous predators, including syrphids. This study investigated the incidence, direction and magnitude of intraguild predation (IGP) between H. axyridis and Episyrphus balteatus in Petri dish arenas with leaf disks on agar. The interactions were examined between larvae, pupae and adults, both in the absence and presence of Acyrthosiphon pisum as an extraguild prey. _x000D_
IGP between H. axyridis and E. balteatus was asymmetric, with the coccinellid in the majority of cases being the IG predator and the syrphid the IG prey. In the absence of extraguild prey, first instars of E. balteatus were most sensitive to IGP, as they were killed by all stages of H. axyridis. Second and third instars of the syrphid were only killed by older larvae and adults of the coccinellid. Pupae of either species were not attacked. In the presence of extraguild prey, the frequency of IGP was substantially reduced. Further research using larger arenas is needed to get a more reliable view on the interactions between these predators.",,0
667,"Intraguild predation by shore crabs affects mortality, behavior, growth, and densities of California horn snails","Abstract The California horn snail, Cerithideopsis californica , and the shore crabs, Pachygrapsus crassipes and Hemigrapsus oregonensis , compete for epibenthic microalgae, but the crabs also eat snails. Such intraguild predation is common in nature, despite models predicting instability. Using a series of manipulations and field surveys, we examined intraguild predation from several angles, including the effects of stage‐dependent predation along with direct consumptive and nonconsumptive predator effects on intraguild prey. In the laboratory, we found that crabs fed on macroalgae, snail eggs, and snails, and the size of consumed snails increased with predator crab size. In field experiments, snails grew less in the presence of crabs partially because snails behaved differently and were buried in the sediment (nonconsumptive effects). Consistent with these results, crab and snail abundances were negatively correlated in three field surveys conducted at three different spatial scales in estuaries of California, Baja California, and Baja California Sur: (1) among 61 sites spanning multiple habitat types in three estuaries, (2) among the habitats of 13 estuaries, and (3) among 34 tidal creek sites in one estuary. These results indicate that shore crabs are intraguild predators on California horn snails that affect snail populations via predation and by influencing snail behavior and performance.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1262,0
668,"Influence of competition and intraguild predation between two candidate biocontrol parasitoids on their potential impact against Harrisia cactus mealybug, Hypogeococcus sp. (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae)","Abstract When two or more parasitoid species, particularly candidates for biocontrol, share the same target in the same temporal window, a complex of behaviors can occur among them. We studied the type of interactions (competition and intraguild predation) that existed between the nymphal parasitoids Anagyrus cachamai and A. lapachosus (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), two candidate neoclassical biocontrol agents against the Puerto Rican cactus pest mealybug, Hypogeococcus sp. (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae). The surrogate native congener host in Argentina, the cactus mealybug Hypogeococcus sp., was studied to predict which species should be released; in the case that both should be released, in which order, and their potential impact on host suppression. In the laboratory we conducted experiments where different densities of the host mealybug were exposed to naive females of A. cachamai and A. lapachosus sequentially in both directions. Experiments were analyzed by combining a series of competitive behavioral and functional response models. A fully Bayesian approach was used to select the best explaining models and calculate their parameters. Intraguild predation existed between A. cachamai , the species that had the greatest ability to exploit the resource, and A. lapachosus , the strongest species in the interference competition. The role that intraguild predation played in suppression of Hypogeococcus sp. indicated that a multiple release strategy for the two biocontrol agents would produce better control than a single release; as for the release order, A. lapachosus should be released first.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92565-6,0
669,Intraguild Predation and Competition Mediate Stage-Structured Interactions between Wood Frog (Rana sylvatica) and Upland Chorus Frog (Pseudacris feriarum) Larvae,"Although anuran larvae with generalist feeding morphology have traditionally been treated as lower-level consumers, emerging studies indicate that the larvae of many species are intraguild predators of other anurans. We conducted two experiments to examine priority effects of the Wood Frog (Rana sylvatica) on the Upland Chorus Frog (Pseudacris feriarum). Wood frogs hatch before upland chorus frogs and could potentially function both as intraguild predators and competitors of the latter. In a laboratory experiment, R. sylvatica did not prey on P. feriarum hatchlings that were greater than 1-day old. In a mesocosm experiment in which food level and the density of R. sylvatica hatchlings were manipulated, R. sylvatica engaged in stage-structured intraguild predation on egg masses of P. feriarum. The number of P. feriarum embryos surviving to hatching was inversely related to the initial density of R. sylvatica, but was independent of food level. Growth rates of P. feriarum hatchlings were inversely related to R. sylvatica density, suggesting strong interspecific competition. Collectively, these results illustrate that the density of an intraguild predator may mediate the strength of both stage-specific intraguild predation and interspecific competition. Our findings suggest that food webs in many seasonal pond communities are more complex than previously thought and need to be revised to incorporate intraguild predation by anurans.",https://doi.org/10.1643/0045-8511(2007)7[131:ipacms]2.0.co;2,0
670,When the aggressiveness degree modifies the intraguild predation magnitude,"In agroecosystems, intraguild predation (IGP) is an ecological interaction that can reduce the effectiveness of biological control programs. Since aggressiveness is correlated with a higher attack rate, it is suspected to influence IGP occurrence. To understand the consequences of increased aggressiveness on the IGP, we used two artificially selected lines of the generalist predator, Nabis americoferus (one aggressive and one docile). We hypothesized that IGP is positively correlated to aggressiveness. Individuals of N. americoferus were tested individually with an intraguild prey (IGPrey), Orius insidiosus, and in the absence or presence of an extraguild prey (XGPrey), third instars of Lygus lineolaris. Firstly, the attack rate of N. americoferus on O. insidiosus was recorded for 15 min and then the IGP after a period of 24 h. We found that aggressive individuals performed a higher attack rate and IGP than docile ones even with the presence of XGPrey. Whereas docile individuals did not display a strong IGP in the absence of XGPrey, it increased significantly when they were introduced. Our results suggest that IGP is positively correlated to a high aggressiveness. Additionally, it seems that docile individuals are more prone to adjust their behavior according to environmental conditions. Finally, the implications of aggressiveness degree for the predator–prey dynamic is discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2023.105385,0
671,Effect of Age-Dependent Parasitism in Eggs of Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) on Intraguild Predation Between Nabis pseudoferus (Hemiptera: Nabidae) and Trichogramma brassicae (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae),"The tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), is a destructive pest of tomato that can cause up to 100% yield loss. The predatory bug Nabis pseudoferus (Remane) (Hemiptera: Nabidae) and the parasitoid Trichogramma brassicae (Bezdenko) (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) are natural enemies of this pest. Since the interaction between predators and parasitoids in different trophic levels including intraguild predation (IGP) can decrease or increase the efficiency of natural enemies, the effects of age-dependent parasitism of host eggs on IGP between these two species were investigated under laboratory conditions. In no-choice and choice preference tests, the predatory bug was exposed to 40 parasitized and nonparasitized eggs of different ages (24, 48, and 72 h old). Investigation of switching behavior was conducted using various combinations of tomato leafminer eggs (30:90, 45:75, 60:60, 75:45, and 90:30 nonparasitized:parasitized eggs) using eggs of different ages (24, 48, and 72 h old). In no-choice tests, the highest feeding rate of the predatory bug was 39.21 ± 0.36 eggs on 24-h-old nonparasitized eggs and the lowest feeding rate was 1.4 ± 0.80 eggs on 72-h-old parasitized eggs. In choice tests, comparison of the Manly's β indices indicated that the predatory bug preferred to feed on nonparasitized eggs with 48- and 72-h-old eggs, but there was no significant preference for the 24-h-old eggs. Results of switching test showed that the linear regression between Manly's β index and different ratios of nonparasitized eggs to parasitized and nonparasitized eggs was not significant in 72-h-old eggs. However, this regression was significant with 24- and 48-h-old eggs and the predator's preference was dependent upon the ratio of nonparasitized and parasitized tomato leafminer eggs. Results of the current study showed that the increasing age of parasitized egg decreased intensity of IGP between N. pseudoferus and T. brassicae.",https://doi.org/10.1093/jisesa/iez040,0
672,"Intraguild predation among the predatory mites<i>Amblyseius eharai</i>,<i>Amblyseius cucumeris</i>and<i>Amblyseius barkeri</i>","Predator species with the same prey interact not only by competition for food and space but also by intraguild predation (IGP). The impact of IGP on introduced phytoseiid mites and native species in the context of biological control is a matter of considerable debate. Amblyseius eharai is the dominant native citrus species in central China, while Amblyseius cucumeris and Amblyseius barkeri are candidates for importation. All three species can feed on the spider mite Panonychus citri, which is the main pest in citrus. This study investigated, in the laboratory, possible IGP among these species in the absence and presence of P. citri, respectively. IGP in different densities of shared prey and intraguild (IG) prey was also studied. All three species consumed heterospecific larvae and eggs but not adults, and the IGP rate of larvae was significantly higher than that of eggs in the absence of shared prey. Additionally, the IGP rate of each group was reduced dramatically in the presence of both shared and IG prey when compared to the absence of shared prey. This occurs most likely because the three species prefer to feed on their natural prey P. citri, rather than on IG prey. Our results showed that A. eharai seems to be a more voracious IG predator than A. cucumeris. A. eharai was much more prone to IGP than A. barkeri.",https://doi.org/10.1080/09583157.2013.849658,0
673,Intraguild predation among generalist predators in winter wheat,"Modern annual arable crops are susceptible to outbreaks of pests due mainly to the uniform habitats that agricultural fields represent. Cereals are particularly prone to infestations of aphids, which may damage the crop directly through herbivory, or indirectly by acting as vectors of disease. These insects, however, have a large range of invertebrate natural enemies, which under certain circumstances, can maintain infestations below economically damaging levels. Greater habitat complexity at landscape and farm scale usually leads to more diverse assemblages of natural enemies at the field scale, but such diversity less often translates to a higher risk for pests. When higher natural enemy diversity is associated with lower levels of pest control, intraguild predation (IGP) is often cited as one of the primary antagonsitic mechanisms. IGP occurs where predators not only compete for the same resource, but also partake in a trophic interaction with one another. Controlled experiments suggest that the niche proximity of predators relative to each other and their shared prey may help predict the outcome of multiple- predator interactions. The primary aim of this thesis was to assess levels of IGP amongst generalist invertebrate predators and to elucidate their spatial patterns, in fields of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum), an important cereal crop in North-West Europe. The chief objective was to establish the regulatory abilities of these predators in the control of aphids. Post-mortem gut content analysis using PCR was used to establish the intensity of IGP by two polyphagous predators, the carabid beetles Pterostichus melanrius and P. madidus, on a number of insectivorous linyphiid spiders and their shared aphid prey. Each of the spiders tested was found to suffer IGP. Predation rates were adjusted using data from controlled feeding trials and resampled using Monte Carlo models to test the hypothesis that predation was density-dependent. In one experiment, the web-occupying linyphiid Tenuiphantes tenuis was consumed by up to a third of P. melanarius. Predation rates by carabids on the linyphiid Bathyphantes gracilis were consistently lower than expected. B. gracilis also relies principally on its web to capture prey, but builds these webs significantly higher in the wheat stem than T. tenuis. Preferences for intraguild prey species more likely to hunt aphids on the ground, the tetragnathid spider Pachygnatha degeeri, and the linyphiids Erigone spp. (E. atra and E. dentipalpis, were less consistent than those species more dependent on their webs to hunt aphids and other prey. While many factors may contribute to the outcomes of multi-predator interactions, these findings broadly supported the hypothesis that niche proximity of intraguild predators is positively related to levels of disruption due to intraguild interactions.",,0
674,Stability and bifurcation analysis of a tri-trophic food chain model with intraguild predation,"The dynamics of a three-component model for food web with intraguild predation is considered. The model is based on the collection of ordinary differential equations that describe the interactions among prey, intermediate predator and top predator. First, the model without self-limitation of the predators is studied. Boundedness of the system and existence of non-negative solutions are established. The local stability analysis of the equilibria is carried out to examine the behavior of the system. The possibility of Hopf bifurcation around non-negative equilibria with consumption rates as bifurcation parameters is studied. Center manifold theorem and the normal form theory are applied to obtain the formulas for determining the direction of Hopf bifurcation and the stability of bifurcating periodic solutions. Numerical simulations support the analytical findings, which show that the extinction of one of the predators can occur under certain restrictions on the predation rate of the top predator. Subsequently, numerical analysis of the model with self-limitation of the predators is carried out. Simulations reveal that the system with intraspecific competition in the predator populations can reproduce coexistence between the three species in resource-rich environment.",https://doi.org/10.1142/s1793524522500735,0
675,Egg Predation by Phytoseiid Predatory Mites: Is There Intraguild Predation Towards Predatory Bug Eggs?,"Abstract Phytoseiid predatory mites are efficient biocontrol agents of important thrips pests, such as the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande (Thysanoptera: Thripidae). Until recently, it was believed that first instars, and to a lesser extent second instars, were the most vulnerable developmental stages of thrips to be attacked by phytoseiids. However, recent evidence showed that some phytoseiids can detect and prey upon thrips eggs inserted in the leaf tissue. As phytoseiid predatory mites often co-occur with other beneficial insects, such as mirid and anthocorid predatory bugs which also insert their eggs inside leaf material, this raises the question whether phytoseiid predatory mites may also feed on predatory bug eggs. Here we first tested the potential of Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot, Transeius montdorensis Schicha, and Amblydromalus limonicus Garman and McGregor (Acari: Phytoseiidae) to kill eggs of F. occidentalis in leaf tissue. Secondly, we tested whether those phytoseiids were capable of killing eggs of Orius laevigatus Fieber (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), Macrolophus pygmaeus Rambur and Nesidiocoris tenuis (Reuter) (Hemiptera: Miridae), three biocontrol agents that also insert their eggs inside plant tissue. Our results showed that A. swirskii and A. limonicus could kill thrips eggs, whereas T. montdorensis could not. Furthermore, we show that the presence of phytoseiid predatory mites does not affect the hatch rate of predatory bugs that insert their eggs inside leaves.",https://doi.org/10.1093/jee/toac092,0
676,Trait adaptation enhances species coexistence and reduces bistability in an intraguild predation module,"Disentangling how species coexist in an intraguild predation (IGP) module is a great step toward understanding biodiversity conservation in complex natural food webs. Trait variation enabling individual species to adjust to ambient conditions may facilitate coexistence. However, it is still unclear how coadaptation of all species within the IGP module, constrained by complex trophic interactions and trade-offs among species-specific traits, interactively affects species coexistence and population dynamics. We developed an adaptive IGP model allowing prey and predator species to mutually adjust their species-specific defensive and offensive strategies to each other. We investigated species persistence, the temporal variation of population dynamics, and the occurrence of bistability in IGP models without and with trait adaptation along a gradient of enrichment represented by carrying capacity of the basal prey for different widths and speeds of trait adaptation within each species. Results showed that trait adaptation within multiple species greatly enhanced the coexistence of all three species in the module. A larger width of trait adaptation facilitated species coexistence independent of the speed of trait adaptation at lower enrichment levels, while a sufficiently large and fast trait adaptation promoted species coexistence at higher enrichment levels. Within the oscillating regime, increasing the speed of trait adaptation reduced the temporal variability of biomasses of all species. Finally, species coadaptation strongly reduced the presence of bistability and promoted the attractor with all three species coexisting. These findings resolve the contradiction between the widespread occurrence of IGP in nature and the theoretical predictions that IGP should only occur under restricted conditions and lead to unstable population dynamics, which broadens the mechanisms presumably underlying the maintenance of IGP modules in nature. Generally, this study demonstrates a decisive role of mutual adaptation among complex trophic interactions, for enhancing interspecific diversity and stabilizing food web dynamics, arising, for example, from intraspecific diversity.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9749,0
677,Intraguild predation may explain an amphipod replacement: evidence from laboratory populations,"In a laboratory experiment that permitted both observations of the behaviour of individuals and the monitoring of small populations, the role of ‘intraguild predation’ in the elimination of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus duebeni celticus by the introduced G. pulex was examined. Over 18 weeks, deaths in single and mixed species replicates were monitored. Rates of ‘mortality’ (deaths not due to cannibalism or predation) did not differ between the species. Gammarus d. celticus, however, was more cannibalistic than G. pulex and, in both species, males were more often cannibalized than females. In mixed species replicates, the mean proportions of animals preyed upon did not differ among replicates with differing starting proportions of the two species, nor was there a difference between the sexes in numbers preyed upon. G. pulex, however, preyed more frequently on G. d. celticus than vice versa, and this became more pronounced over time. In 87% of mixed species replicates, G. pulex eliminated G. d. celticus. The results support the proposition that intraguild predation may be the primary mechanism whereby G. pulex rapidly replaces G. d. celticus in freshwater. Integrating behavioural observations with population level monitoring may thus link pattern and process in behaviour and ecology.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0952836999009802,0
678,The enemy of my enemy is my friend: intraguild predation between invaders and natives facilitates coexistence with shared invasive prey,"Understanding and predicting the outcomes of biological invasions is challenging where multiple invader and native species interact. We hypothesize that antagonistic interactions between invaders and natives could divert their impact on subsequent invasive species, thus facilitating coexistence. From field data, we found that, when existing together in freshwater sites, the native amphipod Gammarus duebeni celticus and a previous invader G. pulex appear to facilitate the establishment of a second invader, their shared prey Crangonyx pseudogracilis. Indeed, the latter species was rarely found at sites where each Gammarus species was present on its own. Experiments indicated that this may be the result of G. d. celticus and G. pulex engaging in more intraguild predation (IGP) than cannibalism; when the 'enemy' of either Gammarus species was present, that is, the other Gammarus species, C. pseudogracilis significantly more often escaped predation. Thus, the presence of mutual enemies and the stronger inter- than intraspecific interactions they engage in can facilitate other invaders. With some invasive species such as C. pseudogracilis having no known detrimental effects on native species, and indeed having some positive ecological effects, we also conclude that some invasions could promote biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2014.0398,0

Cyrtorhinus lividipennis Reuter and Tytthus chinensis Stål (Hemiptera: Miridae) are important natural enemies of brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens Stål (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), the most destructive rice pest in Asia. Comparative functional responses of both sexes of the two mirids at different development stages were estimated and the direction, symmetry, as well as intensity of intraguild predation (IGP) were studied in the laboratory. Prey preferences of the two mirid species and the influence of alternative prey on functional responses were also evaluated. The mirids exhibited reciprocal IGP in addition to consuming eggs of BPH. All predator–prey combinations exhibited a type II functional response. Females and fourth instar nymphs of C. lividipennis showed greater voracity for eggs of BPH than of T. chinensis. The two mirids were more voracious to intraguild prey than to extraguild prey. Alternative prey released the functional responses of C. lividipennis to both intra- and extraguild prey. In contrast, alternative prey had no effect on the functional response of T. chinensis. RIGP was symmetrical in the absence of extraguild prey. And in the presence of extraguild prey that was common in the field, resulted in different responses by the mirids.",https://doi.org/10.1080/09583157.2016.1194370,0
680,Competitive Plant-Mediated and Intraguild Predation Interactions of the Invasive Spodoptera frugiperda and Resident Stemborers Busseola fusca and Chilo partellus in Maize Cropping Systems in Kenya,"Following its recent invasion of African countries, fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), now co-exists with resident stemborers such as Busseola fusca (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Chilo partellus (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) causing severe damage to maize crops. Due to niche overlap, interspecific interactions occur among the three species, but the mechanisms and degree remain unclear. In this study, we assessed plant-mediated intraspecific and interspecific interactions, predation in laboratory and semi-field settings, and larval field occurrence of S. frugiperda and the two stemborer species. Larval feeding assays to evaluate competitive plant-mediated interactions demonstrated that initial S. frugiperda feeding negatively affected subsequent stemborer larval feeding and survival, suggesting induction of herbivore-induced mechanisms by S. frugiperda, which deters establishment and survival of competing species. Predation assays showed that, at different developmental larval stages, second−sixth instars of S. frugiperda preyed on larvae of both B. fusca and C. partellus. Predation rates of S. frugiperda on stemborers was significantly higher than cannibalism of S. frugiperda and its conspecifics (p < 0.001). Cannibalism of S. frugiperda in the presence of stemborers was significantly lower than in the presence of conspecifics (p = 0.04). Field surveys showed a significantly higher number of S. frugiperda larvae than stemborers across three altitudinally different agroecological zones (p < 0.001). In conclusion, this study showed that the invasive S. frugiperda exhibited a clear competitive advantage over resident stemborers within maize cropping systems in Kenya. Our findings reveal some of the possible mechanisms employed by S. frugiperda to outcompete resident stemborers and provide crucial information for developing pest management strategies for these lepidopteran pests.",https://doi.org/10.3390/insects13090790,0
681,"Size-Dependent Intraguild Predation, Cannibalism, and Resource Allocation Determine the Outcome of Species Coexistence","AbstractIntraguild predation (IGP), a system in which species compete for resources and prey on each other, is more common than existing theory predicts. In theory, an IG predator and its prey can coexist if the IG predator is a weaker competitor for a shared resource and the predator directly benefits from consuming the prey. However, many species that are IG predators also consume members of their own species (cannibalism). Here, we ask whether cannibalism can help resolve the paradox of IGP systems. Our approach differs from previous work on IGP and cannibalism by explicitly considering the size dependence of predatory interactions and how the benefits of predation are allocated to survival, growth, and fecundity of the predator or cannibal. Our results show that cannibalism facilitates coexistence under conditions that are opposite of those predicted by standard IGP theory: species can coexist when the cannibal is a better competitor on the shared resources, directly benefits little from consuming conspecifics, and allocates resources from predation more toward growth and fecundity over survival. Because the effects of IGP and cannibalism are opposite, when an IGP predator is also a cannibal, coexistence between the IGP predator and its prey is not possible and instead depends on the operation of other coexistence mechanisms (e.g., resource partitioning). These results point to the importance of understanding the relative rates of IGP and cannibalism as well as the resource allocation strategy of the IG predator in determining the likelihood of species coexistence.",https://doi.org/10.1086/723600,0
682,Effects of predator novelty on intraguild predation communities with adaptive prey defense,"Abstract Understanding coexistence within community modules such as intraguild predation (IGP), where an omnivore both preys on and competes with an intermediate consumer for a shared resource, has provided insight into the mechanisms that promote the persistence of complex food webs. Adaptive, predator-specific defense has been shown theoretically to enhance coexistence of IGP communities when employed by shared prey. Yet to date, all such theory has assumed that prey have an accurate perception of predation risk and appropriate antipredator responses, assumptions that may not be justified when considering a novel predator. We therefore consider the effects of an introduced predator on IGP coexistence, describing two invasion scenarios: suboptimal defense, whereby a similar invader elicits an ineffective antipredator response; and naïveté toward an unfamiliar invader, for which prey fail to accurately estimate predation risk. We examine predictions for native predator persistence across gradients of enrichment and defense costs. The model predicts that predator novelty can weaken the effect of adaptive defense, causing exclusion of native predators that would persist in the absence of novelty and inducing unstable dynamics in previously stable regions of parameter space. Coexistence is predicted to be more sensitive to the effects of suboptimal defense than to naïveté, and differentially leads to the exclusion of native predators in highly productive environments and when defense costs are low. Moderate novelty of the omnivore can increase resource density via a trophic cascade, while consumer novelty can either lead to omnivore exclusion or facilitate three-species coexistence by providing a subsidy to the otherwise excluded native omnivore. Our analyses suggest that models of adaptive defense are sensitive to assumptions regarding predator–prey eco-evolutionary experience and that predator novelty has significant implications for food web dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12080-022-00534-0,0
683,Diet type and prey preference of predators affect intraguild predation between Amblyseius andersoni and Neoseiulus barkeri,"Amblyseius andersoni and Neoseiulus barkeri, two species of phytoseiid mites that are widely used for the control of small sucking pests, were found to co-occur on Chinese wolfberry in Inner Mongolia. We investigated the possibility of intraguild predation (IGP) between A. andersoni and N. barkeri to explore the interactions and coexistence of these two species. Predation and oviposition of the two predators on heterospecific juveniles were measured and compared with Tetranychus truncatus or Typha pollen as food, or without alternative food. The mortality rate of N. barkeri juveniles was not affected by the diet treatment, but that of A. andersoni juveniles was reduced by the presence of spider mites. The presence of spider mites also increased oviposition by A. andersoni but not by N. barkeri, and the presence of pollen had no influence on the oviposition of the two predators. Thus, according to the IGP criteria for gaining benefits from predation on heterospecific juveniles, it was concluded that IGP between A. andersoni and N. barkeri occurred, with A. andersoni as intraguild predator and N. barkeri as intraguild prey when spider mites were present. In a further choice test in which heterospecific juveniles and T. truncatus juveniles were provided for each predator, female A. andersoni preferred to prey on N. barkeri rather than on spider mites, whereas female N. barkeri preferred to feed on spider mites rather than on A. andersoni. These findings indicate that the higher preference of N. barkeri on T. truncatus might result in its lower predation on the other predator species compared with A. andersoni and, thus, increased the possibility of the coexistence of the two predator species. Therefore, the occurrence of IGP between A. andersoni and N. barkeri appears to be influenced by the availability and type of the diet and the prey preference of the predators.",https://doi.org/10.11158/saa.28.8.12,0
684,Cannibalism and intraguild predation between endemic and introduced coccidophagous lady beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae),"Abstract The Chilocorini lady beetles Tenuisvalvae notata (Mulsant) and Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Mulsant are important biological control agents being able to share their habitat and compete for their preferred prey, mealybugs. Whereas T. notata is native to South America, C. montrouzieri is an Australian species introduced in Brazil in a biological control program of mealybugs. This work investigated the cannibalism and intraguild predation between these species in the absence of prey. To test for intraguild predation, one individual larva (instars 1–4) from each species was confined for 24 h with another larva of the same instar or the next instar, in a total of 10 combinations. In addition, we measured predation of T. notata adults upon eggs, larvae, pre‐pupae and pupa of C. montrouzieri , and vice versa. Cannibalism within the species was also tested across adults, larvae and eggs. Results showed asymmetric interactions in favour of C. montrouzieri , which acted as intraguild predator more than 80% of the time when paired with larvae of T. notata either of the same or different instar. In addition, C. montrouzieri adults preyed more upon larvae and eggs of T. notata than the contrary. There was no intraguild predation upon pre‐pupae and pupae. Cannibalism was high upon eggs and first instar larvae of T. notata (89.5% and 65%) and C. montrouzieri (100% and 55%), respectively. Therefore, the exotic C. montrouzieri outcompeted the native T. notata and could become a threat to this endemic species in areas of simultaneous occurrence and under prey scarcity. Thus, the interactions between these lady beetles could affect the success of biological control of mealybugs.",https://doi.org/10.1111/aen.12589,0
685,Influence of intraguild predation between<i>Episyrphus balteatus</i>and<i>Hippodamia variegata</i>on their prey,"Intraguild predation (IGP) is an interaction that frequently occurs in natural enemy communities, especially aphidophagous predators. This research investigated IGP intensity between Episyrphus balteatus De Geer (Diptera: Syrphidae), with Hippodamia variegata Goeze (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). Five predator combinations including second and third larvae of H. variegata and third instar larvae of E. balteatus plus control treatment (totally six treatments) were tested. The effect of IGP on cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae) population density was investigated on sweet pepper seedlings under laboratory microcosms. In most combinations, the third instar larvae of E. balteatus alone reduced an A. gossypii population more efficiently than ladybird larvae and their combinations. Furthermore, IGP between third instar of E. balteatus and second larvae of H. variegata was asymmetrical; second instar H. variegata larvae were always the intraguild prey for third instar E. balteatus. The obtained result showed that outcome of IGP interaction on cotton aphid density was non-additive.",https://doi.org/10.1080/03235408.2013.804249,0
686,Symbiont-conferred immunity interacts with effects of parasitoid genotype and intraguild predation to affect aphid immunity in a clone-specific fashion,"Host-parasite interactions represent complex co-evolving systems in which genetic and associated phenotypic variation within a species can significantly affect selective pressures on traits, such as host immunity, in the other. While often modelled as a two-species interaction between host and parasite, some systems are more complex due to effects of host enemies, intraguild predation, and endosymbionts, all of which affect host immunity. However, it remains unclear how these factors, combined with genetic variation in the host and the parasitoid, affect host immunity. We address this question in an important agricultural pest system, the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, which shows significant intraspecific variability in immunity to the parasitoid wasp Aphidius ervi. In a complex experiment, we use a quantitative genetic design in the parasitoid, two ecologically different aphid lineages and the aphid lion Chrysoperla carnea as an intraguild predator to unravel the complex interdependencies. We demonstrate that aphid immunity as a key trait of this complex host-parasite system is affected by intraspecific genetic variation in the parasitoid and the aphid, the interaction of intraspecific genetic variation with intraguild predation, and differences in defensive endosymbionts between aphid lineages. Further, aphid lineages differ in their altruistic behaviour whereby infested aphids move away from the clonal colony to facilitate predation. Our findings provide new insights into the influence of endosymbiosis and genetic variability in an important host-parasitoid system which is influenced by natural enemies of the parasitoid and the aphid, including its endosymbiont communities. We show that endosymbiosis can mediate or influence the evolutionary arms race between aphids and their natural enemies. The outcome of these complex interactions between species has significant implications for understanding the evolution of multitrophic systems, including eco-agricultural settings.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12862-022-01991-1,0
687,Global dynamics of a reaction-diffusion system with intraguild predation and internal storage,"This paper presents a reaction-diffusion system modeling interactions of the intraguild predator and prey in an unstirred chemostat, in which the predator can also compete with its prey for one single nutrient resource that can be stored within individuals. Under suitable conditions, we first show that there are at least three steady-state solutions for the full system, a trivial steady-state solution with neither species present, and two semitrivial steady-state solutions with just one of the species. Then we establish that coexistence of the intraguild predator and prey can occur if both of the semitrivial steady-state solutions are invasible by the missing species. Comparing with the system without predation, our numerical simulations show that the introduction of predation in an ecosystem can enhance the coexistence of species. Our mathematical arguments also work for the linear food chain model (top-down predation), in which the top-down predator only feeds on the prey but does not compete for nutrient resource with the prey. In our numerical studies, we also do a comparison of intraguild predation and top-down predation.",https://doi.org/10.3934/dcdsb.2019194,0
688,An experimental framework for quantifying the degree of intraguild predation in omnivorous food webs in the field,"Abstract Intraguild predation (IGP) is common in natural and human‐managed systems and plays a critical role in food web dynamics. Although studies have documented the occurrence of IGP across a wide range of predator taxa, quantitative understanding regarding the degree/intensity of IGP remains lacking. I propose an experimental framework combining controlled feeding trials and stable isotope analysis to quantify the degree of IGP in an omnivorous food web in the field consisting of a top predator, a mesopredator, and a shared prey. The degree of IGP is defined as the proportion (in number) of mesopredators consumed in the total diet (shared prey + mesopredator) of top predators. Feeding trials along with stable isotope analysis are used to construct a standard curve of the relationship between the diet composition of top predator and its nitrogen isotope signatures. The nitrogen isotope signatures of field‐collected top predator individuals are then analyzed and interpolated to the standard curve to estimate the degree of IGP in the field. The proposed framework leverages the strengths of different experimental approaches to study trophic interactions, providing a practical tool for quantifying IGP in a more accurate (controlled feeding trials and standard IGP curve) and realistic (stable isotope analysis of field samples) fashion. The current framework can be further extended to food webs involving more complex interactions (e.g., multiple shared prey) and complemented with other approaches (e.g., molecular gut content analysis) to capture a more complete picture of IGP dynamics in the field.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jzo.13050,0

Generalist predator interactions, such as intraguild predation (IGP) and competition, can alleviate predation pressure and weaken top–down control that predators have on lower trophic levels. Centipedes (Chilopoda) and carabid beetles (Coleoptera) are common deciduous forest floor generalist predators that may interact by competing for resources beneath rocks and logs on the forest floor, especially during dry periods when prey become confined to such microhabitats. We used laboratory and field studies to determine whether the carabid beetle, Pterostichus stygicus (Say), and the centipede, Scolopocryptops sexspinosus (Say) co-occur under artificial cover. Additionally, a laboratory mesocosm experiment was used to examine competitive interactions in intra- and interspecific trials. There was significant negative co-occurrence of beetles and centipedes beneath cover objects in the field and laboratory. Pairings of S. sexspinosus and P. stygicus within mesocosms resulted in high mortality of P. stygicus, and reciprocal but asymmetric IGP. Centipedes maintained weight within solitary, intra- and interspecific mesocosm treatments, however, beetles lost mass in all treatments. Scolopocryptops sexspinosus responded more favorably to intra- and interspecific competition than did P. stygicus. Analysis of the leaf litter mesofauna indicated that these predators consumed similar prey in laboratory mesocosms. Our results suggest that species with very different trophic morphology have the potential to compete for shared microhabitat and prey.",https://doi.org/10.1093/aesa/saz034,0
692,"Aphid alarm pheromone alters larval behaviour of the predatory gall midge, <i>Aphidoletes aphidimyza</i> and decreases intraguild predation by anthocorid bug, <i>Orius laevigatus</i>","Abstract Intraguild predation is the killing and consuming of a heterospecific competitor that uses similar resources as the prey, and also benefit from preying on each other. We investigated the foraging behaviour of the gallmidge, Aphidoletes aphidimyza , a predator of aphids used for biological control that is also the intraguild prey for most other aphid natural enemies. We focus on how aphid alarm pheromone can alter the behaviour of the gallmidge, and predation by the anthocorid bug Orius laevigatus ( O. laevigatus ). We hypothesised that gallmidges would respond to the presence of ( E )-β-farnesene (EBF) by leaving the host plant. Since feeding by Aphidoletes gallmidge larvae does not induce EBF emission by aphids, this emission indicates the presence of an intraguild predator. We found that gallmidge larvae reduced their foraging activities and left the plant earlier when exposed to EBF, particularly when aphids were also present. Contrastingly, gallmidge females did not change the time visiting plants when exposed to EBF, but lay more eggs on plants that had a higher aphid density. Lastly, EBF reduced the number of attacks of the intraguild predator, O. laevigatus , on gallmidge larvae, potentially because more gallmidges stopped aphid feeding and moved off the plant at which point O. laevigatus predated on aphids. Our work highlights the importance of understanding how intraguild predation can influence the behaviour of potential biological control agents and the impact on pest control services when other natural enemies are also present.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007485321000122,0
693,Impact of<i>Cheiracanthium pelasgicum</i>(Araneae: Miturgidae) and<i>Chrysoperla carnea</i>(Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) intraguild predation on the potential control of cotton pest<i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>(Lepidoptera: Noctuidae),"Antagonist interactions such as intraguild predation (IGP) or cannibalism among predatory arthropods can reduce the impact of these invertebrates on pest limitation in agroecosystems. Here, the effects of IGP between two major natural enemies of cotton pests, the cursorial spider Cheiracanthium pelasgicum (C.L. Koch) and the common green lacewing Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens), were studied under laboratory conditions. First, a feeding preference test was carried out to determine the degree of C. pelasgicum preference for lacewing larvae, using second-instar Helicoverpa armigera larvae as alternative prey. In a second bioassay, the effects of predator interactions on potential predation of H. armigera larvae were analysed using three treatment combinations (plus a control with no predator): (1) spider alone, (2) lacewing larvae alone, (3) spider + lacewing larvae. Potential predation by C. pelasgicum on lacewing eggs was also studied. C. pelasgicum showed no significant preference for either of the two species, indicating that this spider may impact negatively on the green lacewing population. Findings revealed no additive effects and an antagonist interaction between C. pelasgicum and green lacewing larvae, which adversely affected H. armigera suppression; both predators displayed lower predation rates when kept together than either predator alone. However, presence of lacewing larvae and subsequent unidirectional IGP did not affect the predation capacity of C. pelasgicum. Finally, predation rates of C. pelasgicum on lacewing eggs were very low (mean 2.35 ± 0.71 eggs, 24 h after offering) indicating that the impact of C. pelasgicum on lacewing populations may be limited.",https://doi.org/10.1080/09583157.2013.855167,0
694,Pattern of seasonal variation in rates of predation between spider families is temporally stable in a food web with widespread intraguild predation,"Intraguild predation (IGP)-predation between generalist predators (IGPredator and IGPrey) that potentially compete for a shared prey resource-is a common interaction module in terrestrial food webs. Understanding temporal variation in webs with widespread IGP is relevant to testing food web theory. We investigated temporal constancy in the structure of such a system: the spider-focused food web of the forest floor. Multiplex PCR was used to detect prey DNA in 3,300 adult spiders collected from the floor of a deciduous forest during spring, summer, and fall over four years. Because only spiders were defined as consumers, the web was tripartite, with 11 consumer nodes (spider families) and 22 resource nodes: 11 non-spider arthropod taxa (order- or family-level) and the 11 spider families. Most (99%) spider-spider predation was on spider IGPrey, and ~90% of these interactions were restricted to spider families within the same broadly defined foraging mode (cursorial or web-spinning spiders). Bootstrapped-derived confidence intervals (BCI's) for two indices of web structure, restricted connectance and interaction evenness, overlapped broadly across years and seasons. A third index, % IGPrey (% IGPrey among all prey of spiders), was similar across years (~50%) but varied seasonally, with a summer rate (65%) ~1.8x higher than spring and fall. This seasonal pattern was consistent across years. Our results suggest that extensive spider predation on spider IGPrey that exhibits consistent seasonal variation in frequency, and that occurs primarily within two broadly defined spider-spider interaction pathways, must be incorporated into models of the dynamics of forest-floor food webs.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0293176,0
695,Chaos emergence and dissipation in a three-species food web model with intraguild predation and cooperative hunting,"&lt;abstract&gt;&lt;p&gt;We explore the dynamics of a three-species Lotka-Volterra model incorporating intraguild (IG) predation. The model encompasses interactions between a basal prey, intraguild prey and omnivorous top/intraguild predator. These interactions are characterized by linear functional responses, while considering intraspecific competition and cooperative hunting dynamics. The study involves a comprehensive stability of different steady states and bifurcation analysis. Bifurcation structures unveil shifts in equilibrium stability and the emergence of new equilibrium states. Investigation into dynamics around the coexistence equilibrium highlights diverse behaviors, including stable coexistence, oscillations and chaos. Furthermore, exploration of species' densities under parameter variations uncovers distinct patterns, ranging from stability to chaos. Incorporating the concept of hunting cooperation among IG predators and IG prey can lead to the emergence or suppression of chaotic oscillations, respectively. Additionally, we observe that lower consumption rate of IG predator and cooperation of IG predator helps the system to keep in a stable state position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/abstract&gt;",https://doi.org/10.3934/math.2024051,0
696,Intraguild predation in Harmonia axyridis and its effects on native coccinellids,"During the 1990s, over a period of just a few years, the multi-colored Asian lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) invaded the entire area of northern Europe. In parallel with this invasion, a decline in native coccinellid species was recorded in Belgium, Britain, and Switzerland, affecting mainly one common species: the two-spot ladybird, Adalia bipunctata L. An impressive trait of H. axyridis, that could explain both its high invasiveness and the decline of native coccinellids, is its predation behaviour. Intraguild predation is a trophic interaction between species that share the same prey – in this case, aphids. In order to determine the precise impact of this predation on the native coccinellid species, the predation behaviour of H. axyridis larvae was observed in Petri dishes and on plants. The resistance of H. axyridis to predation was also studied by exposing it without dorsal spines to native predator larvae, in order to test whether or not the dorsal spines are a physical defence against intraguild predation. In addition to these laboratory experiments, an original method was developed and used to track predation under field conditions. This method is based on the gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) detection of exogenous alkaloids in H. axyridis, especially alkaloids from native coccinellids likely to be subject to intraguild predation. My results show that, in the absence of aphids, H. axyridis consumes both A. bipunctata eggs and all larval instars in Petri dishes. On plants, depending to aphid density, this interaction can change with regards to larvae but not eggs. In addition to intraguild predation, competitive exclusion can occur because of quite aggressive behaviour towards competitors. Dorsal spines significantly reduce the number of bites inflicted, and thereby complement the other defense mechanisms of H. axyridis that enable it to remain dominant in competition for food resources. In semi-natural conditions, predation on the native coccinellids Adalia spp., Calvia spp., Coccinella septempunctata L. and Propylea quatuordecimpunctata (L.) was detected. The number of sites where this predation was observed suggests that this interaction is frequent. It was also observed that an H. axyridis larva can ingest several native coccinellid species, confirming its status as a predator of coccinellids. We can therefore conclude that intraguild predation by H. axyridis leads, as does resource competition, to a decline in native coccinellids./Introduite pour la lutte biologique dans les annees 90, la Coccinelle asiatique, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas), a envahi en quelques annees toute l’Europe du Nord. Parallelement a cette invasion, un declin de plusieurs especes de coccinelles indigenes dont la tres commune Coccinelle a deux points, Adalia bipunctata L., a ete observe dans differents biotopes en Belgique, en Angleterre ainsi qu’en Suisse. Un des traits remarquables de la Coccinelle asiatique est son comportement de predateur intraguilde qui pourrait expliquer a la fois ce declin mais aussi en partie son caractere hautement invasif. La predation intraguilde est une interaction trophique entre des especes qui se nourrissent d’une meme proie, dans ce cas-ci les pucerons. Afin de mieux connaitre l’impact de cette predation sur les coccinelles indigenes, le comportement de predation des larves d’H. axyridis a ete decrit en boites de Petri et sur plantes. Sa resistance a la predation a egalement ete etudiee en exposant des larves depourvues d’epines dorsales a un predateur indigene, dans le but de tester le role de ces epines en tant que defense physique a l’egard d’un predateur intraguilde. En plus de ces experiences de laboratoire, une methode originale a ete developpee et utilisee pour suivre cette predation en conditions semi-naturelles. Elle se base sur la detection, en GC-MS, des alcaloides exogenes chez H. axyridis et en particulier des alcaloides produits par d'autres especes de coccinelles susceptibles de subir une predation intraguilde. Mes resultats montrent qu'en l'absence de pucerons, H. axyridis a un comportement de predation vis-a-vis des œufs et de tous les stades larvaires d’A. bipunctata. La presence de pucerons, suivant leur densite, peut modifier cette interaction a l’egard des larves indigenes mais pas des œufs. En plus de la predation intraguilde, une competition par exclusion peut etre aussi suspectee et expliquee par le comportement tres agressif d’H. axyridis a l’egard de ses concurrents. Quant aux epines dorsales, elles permettent de reduire significativement le nombre de morsures et completent ainsi les autres lignes de defense utilisees par H. axyridis pour s’imposer dans des ressources deja exploitees par d’autres predateurs. En conditions semi-naturelles, cette predation a l’egard des coccinelles indigenes a ete confirmee vis-a-vis d’Adalia spp., Calvia spp., Coccinella septempunctata L. et Propylea quatuordecimpunctata (L.). Vu le nombre de sites ou cette predation a ete detectee, elle peut etre consideree comme une interaction frequente. De plus, une meme larve de coccinelle asiatique peut ingerer plusieurs especes de coccinelles indigenes confirmant indeniablement son statut de predateur de coccinelles. Ainsi, nous pouvons conclure que la predation intraguilde par H. axyridis sur les coccinelles indigenes participe tres certainement au declin de celles-ci et ceci tres probablement au meme titre que des phenomenes de competition pour les ressources.",,0
697,Intraguild predation of lynxes on foxes: evidence of interference competition?,"There is a growing focus among ecologists on the importance of predatory interactions between competing species, but because of its mixed character. it is difficult to pinpoint the possible, competitive component of the interaction. We tested degree of prey consumption in intraguild predation of Eurasian lynxes on red foxes against assumed 'pure' predation. i.e, roe deer and mountain hares. The proportion of uneaten fox carcasses was highly significantly larger than the proportion of both other prey species, indicating that interference competition may play a role in the intraguild predation of lynxes on red foxes.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1999.tb00540.x,0
698,Spider mites avoid caterpillar traces to prevent intraguild predation,"The phytophagous spider mites Tetranychus kanzawai and Tetranychus urticae can be as small as < 0.5 mm; thus, they are often incidentally consumed along with food plant leaves by voracious lepidopteran larvae (hereafter, 'caterpillars'). Therefore, the ability to avoid such intraguild predation should confer a selective advantage to mites. We experimentally demonstrated that adult females of both mite species avoided settling on food plant leaves with traces of all tested caterpillar species (Bombyx mori, Papilio xuthus, Spodoptera litura and Theretra oldenlandiae). We examined additional interactions using B. mori and T. kanzawai and found that B. mori trace avoidance by T. kanzawai lasted for more than 48 h. Tetranychus kanzawai also avoided B. mori traces on plant stems, along which mites access leaves. Moreover, T. kanzawai avoided acetone extracts of B. mori traces applied to filter paper, indicating that chemical substances of caterpillar traces are responsible for the avoidance. This study is the first demonstration of a repellent effect of herbivore trace chemicals on heterospecific herbivores. Although spider mites have developed resistance against many synthetic pesticides, these results predict that natural compounds simulating caterpillar traces may repel spider mites from agricultural crops.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-28861-0,0
699,Intraguild predation of Atlantic mackerel on early life stages of anchovy and sardine,"Event Abstract Back to Event Intraguild predation of Atlantic mackerel on early life stages of anchovy and sardine Eneko Bachiller1*, Elsa Cuende1, Paula Alvarez1, Almudena Fontán1, Naiara Rodriguez-Ezpeleta1 and Unai Cotano1 1 AZTI Foundation, Marine Ecosystem Functioning Area, Spain Intraguild predation between small pelagic fish as regulation mechanism of early life stage survival (e.g. top-down control) may have a significant effect on inter-annual variations in fish abundance and recruitment variability. For instance, although traditionally linked to physical (e.g. transport, retention) processes, survival of anchovy early life stages in the main spawning grounds (i.e. French continental shelf in spring) of the Bay of Biscay is partly regulated by small pelagic fish predation. Visual identification of adult fish stomach contents may underestimate early life stage mortality due to predation; indeed, preliminary genetic based prey identification suggests new potential predators such as mackerel larvae potentially feeding on anchovy and sardine eggs in the shelf break, where they could have been transported by advection. However, the role of different life stages of mackerel as potential predators and the relevance of their co-occurrence in the anchovy and sardine main spawning and nursery areas for early life stages survival and recruitment, remain unclear. This study combines both microscope and genetic based prey identification to provide more accurate estimates of anchovy and sardine early life stage mortality of due to predation by mackerel larvae and adults. In addition, egg and larvae transport is considered as a potential factor that may regulate the effects of the intraguild predation, increasing or decreasing the prey-predator encounter rates. This study provides new insights into the trophic interactions in the Bay of Biscay, which is critical to inform advanced multispecies ecosystem models.

700,Impact of intraspecific and intraguild predation on predator invasion and coexistence. Can exotic ladybeetles displace native species,"Exotic predators are more likely to replace related native species when these species not only compete for similar prey species, but also predate on the offspring of the native predators. In several groups of arthropods, however, this intraguild predation (IGP) is not only mutual, but also co-occurs with intraspecific predation (ISP or cannibalism). These different processes may have counteracting effects on species invasion and coexistence. In this study, we derived simple rules that describe under which combinations of IGP and ISP a predator species is able to invade into a stable predator-prey system, and under which conditions an invasion will results in displacement or in coexistence. This theory is then applied to species pairs of exotic and native lady beetles, to test if differences in IGP and ISP may play a role in the establishment of introduced exotic ladybeetles species (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) such as Harmonia axyridis in Europe and Coccinella septempunctata in North America. For an accurate estimation of the key processes we cannot rely on specific experimental data only, but take allometric relationships into account as well. For ladybeetles, IGP and ISP seem to be determined largely by size differences of the interacting larvae, thereby giving an overall advantage to the larger species. On the other hand, larger species generally have higher food requirements, which may give them a disadvantage in resource competition. The estimated levels of IGP, ISP and competitive ability of the interacting species can not fully explain the invasion by the two exotic ladybeetles species. _________________ Impact of Intraspecific and Intraguild Predation on Predator Invasion and Coexistence Second International Symposium on Biological Control of Arthropods 39 INTRODUCTION In recent years the invasive nature of two ladybeetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) has drawn considerable attention in the scientific literature. The originally Eurasian Coccinella septempunctata L. established and spread through the whole of North-America in the 70s and 80s (Alyokhin and Sewell 2004; Elliott et al. 1996). Later, in the mid 90s, the originally Asian Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) became established in various parts of North-America and more recently in some parts of Western Europe as well (Adriaens et al. 2003). Simultaneous with their establishment in new habitats a population decline of native species was observed. The establishment of C. septempunctata in arable fields in North America was followed by a dramatic decline of several native ladybeetles (including Adalia bipunctata L.) in these fields (Alyokhin and Sewell 2004; Elliott et al. 1996; Evans 2004; Wheeler and Hoebeke 1995). C. septempunctata also became the dominant ladybeetle species in apple orchards, pushing A. bipunctata to a second position (Brown 2003; Brown and Miller 1998). The later establishment of H. axyridis in orchards resulted in a local decline of especially this other exotic C. septempunctata (Brown 2003), but this pattern is not yet apparent in arable fields (Nault and Kennedy 2003). In none of the cases the exotic species has resulted in the exclusion of native species. Resource competition for aphid prey is a possible explanation for the decline in native species following the establishment of the exotic one (Evans 2004). However, no evidence is yet provided that the exotic species are better resource competitors than the native ones. Intraguild predation (IGP) between the exotic and native ladybeetles is regarded as the most likely reason for the spread of the exotic species and the subsequent reduction of native or earlier-established species (Yasuda and Ohnuma 1999). Lab studies indeed show that the IGP by the exotic species on native species is generally bigger than the reverse predation (Snyder et al. 2004; Yasuda et al. 2004), and that IGP between the two exotic species is in favour of H. axyridis (Yasuda and Ohnuma 1999). A complicating factor is that these predators not only feed on the juveniles of other predator species, but also on those from their own species. This cannibalism or Intraspecific Predation (ISP) may partly reduce the effect of IGP on population dominance. In this study we therefore start with reviewing the theory on the combined impact of IGP and ISP on population dynamics. Then we show how the strength of the different interand intraspecific interaction may be calculated, and use these values to derive predictions on invasibility and species coexistence. In the second part we include resource competition in our theory. How will the various coccinelids differ in competitive ability, and how will this alter our conclusions. Finally, we will discuss the realism of our simplifying assumptions, indicate how spatial and temporal avoidance, resource partitioning and metapopulation dynamics may affect our conclusions.",,0
701,Cannibalism and intraguild predation of phytoseiid mites Neoseiulus barkeri and Neoseiulus cucumeris,"Phytoseiid mites Neoseiulus barkeri and N.cucumeris are the generalists mainly preying on spider mites and thrips,and widely used in agricultural bio-control.In this paper,the cannibalism and intraguild predation of N.barkeri and N.cucumeris and the female aggressiveness on larvae(quantified as attack probability) in intraguild predation were studied,aimed to elucidate the interrelationships between these two species of predatory mite to reasonably establish a combination of different natural enemies in biological control.The results showed that the phytoseiid mites consumed more con-and heterospecific larvae,lesser protonymphs,and seldom con-and heterospecific eggs.The adult females of the two species mites exhibited higher predation rates on heterospecific larvae and protonymphs than on conspecific larvae and protonymphs,suggesting that the two species of mites preferentially engaged in intraguild predation in absence of other food sources.The predation rate of N.barkeri on heterospecific larvae and protonymphs was higher than that of N.cucumeri.Moreover,N.barkeri was more aggressive to heterospecific larvae than N.cucumeri in intraguild predation.Therefore,N.barkeri was most probably a potential intraguild predator of N.cucumeris,whereas N.cucumeri was a potential intraguild prey when the intraguild predation occurred between N.barkeri and N.cucumeris.",,0
702,Direct Effect of Cannibalism and Intraguild Predation in Menochilus sexmaculatus (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae),"Menochilus sexmaculatus F. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is a generalist predator with potential as a biological control candidate for suppressing many insect pests, including the cotton mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae). However, the potential control capacity of M. sexmaculatus on P. solenopsis may depend not only on its fitness and predatory efficacy, but also on the consequences of both conspecific and heterospecific interactions with other individuals that share the same resource. This study investigated the aggressiveness and vulnerability of different life stages of M. sexmaculatus when encountering various stages of M. sexmaculatus or Harmonia axyridis (Pallas). The results showed that M. sexmaculatus could act as predator and/or prey with the presence of conspecific and heterospecific ladybird beetles. The success of predation is affected by the ladybird beetle life stage and, in most cases, young stages of the ladybird beetles were most susceptible to relatively older life stages of ladybird beetles. Predation between M. sexmaculatus/H. axyridis larvae of the same developmental stage was always asymmetric, favoring H. axyridis. Moreover, M. sexmaculatus exhibited intensive aggressiveness toward their own species over heterospecific individuals, but was more vulnerable to H. axyridis than to M. sexmaculatus individuals. Overall, H. axyridis could negatively affect the population densities of M. sexmaculatus by its high aggressiveness and low vulnerability. However, because our study was conducted in an oversimplified and confined area, more research should be conducted under more realistic conditions to explore the impacts of H. axyridis on the population dynamics of M. sexmaculatus.",https://doi.org/10.18474/jes23-08,0

While in some cases release of multiple species may provide a better control, in other cases species may interact with each other with possible negative outcome on biological control program. In this study, intraguild predation was assessed among three phytoseiid species, Amblyseius swirskii (Athias-Henriot), Neoseiulus barkeri (Hughes) and Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot under laboratory conditions in either absence or presence of Tetranychus urticae Koch and/or pollen. Adult females of all three predator species exhibited higher predation rate on larvae than on the other immature stages. Phytoseiulus persimilis did not feed on the nymphal stages of the other two phytoseiid species, while A. swirskii and N. barkeri fed on all juvenile stages of the two others. Females of A. swirskii consumed more phytoseiid larvae than did the other two species. However, the predation of females of the three species on immature stages decreased significantly when prey/food was added to experimental units. Our results suggest that the three species, A. swirskii, N. barkeri and P. persimilis are potentially prone to intraguild interactions with each other, and A. swirskii is the strongest intraguild predator. The results of this study may be helpful in selecting effective biological control strategies against spider mites.",https://doi.org/10.11158/saa.21.4.4,0
704,Slow-Release Sachets of Neoseiulus cucumeris Predatory Mites Reduce Intraguild Predation by Dalotia coriaria in Greenhouse Biological Control Systems,"Intraguild predation of Neoseiulus cucumeris Oudemans (Phytoseiidae) by soil-dwelling predators, Dalotia coriaria Kraatz (Staphylinidae) may limit the utility of open rearing systems in greenhouse thrips management programs. We determined the rate of D. coriaria invasion of N. cucumeris breeder material presented in piles or sachets, bran piles (without mites), and sawdust piles. We also observed mite dispersal from breeder piles and sachets when D. coriaria were not present. Dalotia coriaria invaded breeder and bran piles at higher rates than sawdust piles and sachets. Furthermore, proportions of N. cucumeris in sachets were six- to eight-fold higher compared with breeder piles. When D. coriaria were absent, N. cucumeris dispersed from breeder piles and sachets for up to seven weeks. In earlier weeks, more N. cucumeris dispersed from breeder piles compared with sachets, and in later weeks more N. cucumeris dispersed from sachets compared with breeder piles. Sachets protected N. cucumeris from intraguild predation by D. coriaria resulting in higher populations of mites. Therefore, sachets should be used in greenhouse biocontrol programs that also release D. coriaria. Furthermore, breeder piles that provide ""quick-releases"" or sachets that provide ""slow-releases"" of mites should be considered when incorporating N. cucumeris into greenhouse thrips management programs.",https://doi.org/10.3390/insects6020489,0
705,Coexistence of top predators in headwater streams : pathways of intraguild predation between Pacific Giant salamander larvae and cutthroat trout,"approved: Deanna H. Olson I Stanley V. Gregory The coexistence of multiple predators may have important consequences for the structure and function of communities. Interactions between predators may strongly affect their combined direct and indirect effects on prey populations and lower trophic levels. Predators often have size-structured populations, which may result in intraguild predation characterized by complex trophic and behavioral interactions. Coexistence of multiple predators may strongly depend on antipredator defenses of small size classes that reduce their vulnerability to predation. In Pacific Northwest forested ecosystems, Pacific giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) and coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki clarki) are the top predators in many perennial headwater streams. Dicamptodon and cutthroat have size-structured populations with roughly corresponding size classes, and interactions between these species appear consistent with intraguild predation. My research objective was to determine the mechanisms contributing to the coexistence of Dicamptodon larvae with cutthroat trout in headwater streams, and Redacted for privacy the effects of this coexistence on factors related to Dicamptodon fitness. First, I tested for two general types of antipredator defenses of young-of-year Dicamptodon larvae against trout. Larvae were palatable to trout during initial and repeated offerings, which suggests that they may survive few encounters with trout. However, larvae increased refuge use in response to non-visual, chemical cues from trout, which likely reduces the probability of encounters with trout and contributes to their coexistence. Second, I measured the effects of cutthroat trout on Dicamptodon fitness parameters in a field experiment. Dicamptodon survival, growth, and behavior (activity level) did not differ between trout-present and troutabsent poois, although these results were compromised by unexplained gains or losses of larvae from most pools. Antipredator behaviors may promote coexistence of Dicamptodon and cutthroat trout, and may contribute to a complex series of behavioral and trophic interactions affecting lower trophic levels within headwater stream communities. ©Copyright by David E.

706,"Larval Cannibalism and Intraguild Predation Between the Introduced Green Lacewing,<i>Chrysoperla carnea</i>, and the Indigenous Trash-Carrying Green Lacewing,<i>Mallada desjardinsi</i>(Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), as a Case Study of Potential Nontarget Effect Assessment","To study the potential competitive risk of the introduced Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) on the indigenous trash-carrying chrysopid Mallada desjardinsi (Navás), we studied the occurrence of cannibalism and intraguild predation (IGP) at different prey densities. In C. carnea, 100% cannibalism was observed in the absence of aphids. In M. desjardinsi, cannibalism was also observed, but absence of cannibalism occurred at 35% in pairs of second- + third-instar larvae and at 70% in pairs of third- + third-instar larvae. In pairs of M. desjardinsi larvae whose trash package had been artificially removed, all third-instar larvae ate second-instar larvae. The trash package may play a role in the reduced mortality of younger larvae by cannibalism. IGP occurred in all pairs. In the absence of aphids, the interaction was symmetric between second-instar larvae, but asymmetric for second- versus third- and third- versus third-instar larvae, and the interaction was similar when M. desjardinsi larvae with or without trash package were paired with C. carnea larvae. When third-instar larvae of both species were paired, C. carnea larvae ate significantly greater numbers of M. desjardinsi larvae than vice versa. The trash package of M. desjardinsi larvae may thus not play a defensive role against IGP by C. carnea. Increasing the availability of aphids tended to decrease both cannibalism and IGP levels. Nontarget effects such as competitive displacement resulting in loss of potentially beneficial attributes of the indigenous M. desjardinsi by the exotic C. carnea are likely to be negligible under conditions of abundant aphids.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ee/35.5.1298,0
707,High resolution temporal data shows how increasing prey availability reduces early season intraguild predation and pest spread in cereal crops,"Intraguild predation is an extreme form of competition, that depends on resource availability, niche overlap, behaviour and diversity. However, despite modelling and mesocosm experiments, field studies are scarce, and we know nothing of its temporal dynamics within real-world food webs, particularly in the context of biological control. To address this, we added manure to cereal fields to increase decomposer prey, and analysed the diet of over 6000 predators over the entire cropping season during two consecutive years. Our results show that manure increased available prey temporarily and reduced intraguild predation. With this organic fertilization, a reduction in pest spread between tillers within fields correlated with lower intraguild predation, while pest density remained unchanged across treatments, making the net effect on biological control unclear. We hypothesize that the mechanism responsible for why lowering intraguild predation reduces pest spread are changes in predator behaviour, that allow predators to exert more pressure on pests. Conversely, the absence of an effect on pest density may be linked to other effects of fertilization, such as increased pest and plant growth counteracting any increase in predation pressure. The high temporal resolution of our data showed how dynamic IGP is throughout the season, which stresses the importance of studying food webs over time, to generate a mechanistic understanding of biological control.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2024.105549,0

Agistemus exsertus successfully developed and reproduced on con- and heterospecific eggs. Feeding on the natural prey Tetranychus urticae Koch eggs enhanced the development of A. exsertus, resulted in the shortest mean generation time and was the most commensurate food for the oviposition of the predator, as exhibited by the highest predation rate, fecundity and net reproductive rate. Preying interspecifically on eggs of Typhlodromus negevi Swirski and Amitai and the natural prey T. urticae produced higher intrinsic rates of increase and finite rates of increase for the predator in comparison to feed on conspecific eggs. Preying intraspecifically gave the lowest predation rate, fecundity, net reproductive rate and negative value of intrinsic rates of increase.When the predator confined without prey, no eggs was laid by the predator.This difference in the predator response to feed intra and interspecific predation should be considered to enhance the role of the predator in biological control programs.",https://doi.org/10.1556/aphyt.48.2013.2.8,0
709,Pulsed supplies of small fish facilitate short-term intraguild predation in salmon stocked streams,"Abstract Pulsed supplies of prey organisms generally increase predator food intake. However, whether this holds true when predators and pulsed prey are in same guild (i.e., intraguild [IG] predators and prey) is unclear. IG prey may increase IG-predator food intake by providing a food source, but they may decrease food intake through competition. To test these hypotheses, we compared the food intake of white-spotted charr ( Salvelinus leucomaenis ) (IG predator) in streams that were stocked or unstocked with hatchery-reared masu salmon ( Oncorhynchus masou ) fry (IG prey) in streams in Hokkaido, Japan. One day after stocking, masu salmon fry occupied nearly 60% of the stomach contents by wet weight of white-spotted charr in stocked streams, and mean stomach content weight was six-times higher than in unstocked streams. However, predation of white-spotted charr on stocked fry was rare on other days. Acquisition of predator-avoidance behavior by stocked fry and/or a lack of accommodation by white-spotted charr to the sudden emergence of a new prey source (e.g., the charr in study sites were basically insectivorous, and their foraging behavior might have been ineffective for piscivory) may explain this time-limited intraguild predation. In days other than the first day post-stocking, food intake by white-spotted charr did not differ between stocked and unstocked streams. No effects of interspecific competition on white-spotted charr food intake were observed; this may be due to the body-size advantage of white-spotted charr and/or the low density of stocked masu-salmon fry.",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-702103/v1,0
710,Dipteran Prey Vulnerability in Intraguild Predation (IGP) System Involving Heteropteran Predators: Density and Habitat Effects,"(1) Background: The effects of density and the habitat conditions on the prey vulnerability in the Intraguild Predation (IGP) system were evaluated using the water bug D. rusticus as the top predator. (2) Methods: Using two different density levels (low or high) of the dipteran prey (mosquito and chironomid), the IGP system was set with A. bouvieri as the IG prey. (3) Results: The prey vulnerability was reduced in complex habitat conditions, irrespective of the prey and predator density levels and the prey identity. Correspondingly, the IG prey vulnerability was higher in the low shared prey density and complex habitat. The IG prey consumption by the top predator was higher with the mosquito as shared prey than chironomid as shared prey. Observations on the prey consumption indicated that the consumption of both the chironomid and the mosquito prey dwindled with the time for all combinations of the prey density and the habitat conditions. On a comparative scale, the prey clearance rates were higher for mosquitoes in contrast to the chironomid larvae as shared prey. (4) Conclusions: Apparently, a complex set of interactions involving the habitat conditions, top predator and the prey determines mosquito prey vulnerability against the water bug. Such interactions provide evidence for the coexistence of the mosquito larvae along with multiple predators in the wetland ecosystem.",https://doi.org/10.3390/limnolrev23010001,0
711,"Intraguild predation of Phenacoccus manihoti parasitoid Anagyrus lopezi by two mealybug predators, Cryptolaemus montrouzieri and Plesiochrysa ramburi","Abstract Anagyrus lopezi is a specialist parasitoid was introduced to Indonesia in 2014 to control cassava mealybug, Phenacoccus manihoti. Plesiochrysa ramburi and Cryptolaemus montrouzieri are generalist predator insects associated with the mealybug. Intraguild predation is a crucial competition in an insect community. The study objective was to investigate interference of both predators on healthy mealybug (unparasitized) or parasitized mealybug by A. lopezi (mealybug which containing parasitoid larvae 1-, 3-, 8-, and 14-day old). Experiments were carried out in a non-choice test (served only one unparasitized or parasitized mealybug of a specific parasitoid age) and choice test (unparasitized and parasitized mealybug of a specific parasitoid age together) in laboratory under controlled environmental conditions. Both of predators species able to fed on both unparasitized and parasitized mealybugs of three different age (1-, 3-, and 8- day-old), but both predators discriminated against mealybug were parasitized 14-day old (hardened mummies). Interaction between parasitoid of A. lopezi and both predators showed antagonistic interaction type. We recommended A. lopezi should be released in field at the beginning of the time when the population of the mealybug is still low and could be continued with the predators release when the mealybug population is high.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/1230/1/012101,0
712,Phenotypic plasticity in anti-intraguild predator strategies: mite larvae adjust their behaviours according to vulnerability and predation risk,"Interspecific threat-sensitivity allows prey to maximize the net benefit of antipredator strategies by adjusting the type and intensity of their response to the level of predation risk. This is well documented for classical prey-predator interactions but less so for intraguild predation (IGP). We examined threat-sensitivity in antipredator behaviour of larvae in a predatory mite guild sharing spider mites as prey. The guild consisted of the highly vulnerable intraguild (IG) prey and weak IG predator Phytoseiulus persimilis, the moderately vulnerable IG prey and moderate IG predator Neoseiulus californicus and the little vulnerable IG prey and strong IG predator Amblyseius andersoni. We videotaped the behaviour of the IG prey larvae of the three species in presence of either a low- or a high-risk IG predator female or predator absence and analysed time, distance, path shape and interaction parameters of predators and prey. The least vulnerable IG prey A. andersoni was insensitive to differing IGP risks but the moderately vulnerable IG prey N. californicus and the highly vulnerable IG prey P. persimilis responded in a threat-sensitive manner. Predator presence triggered threat-sensitive behavioural changes in one out of ten measured traits in N. californicus larvae but in four traits in P. persimilis larvae. Low-risk IG predator presence induced a typical escape response in P. persimilis larvae, whereas they reduced their activity in the high-risk IG predator presence. We argue that interspecific threat-sensitivity may promote co-existence of IG predators and IG prey and should be common in predator guilds with long co-evolutionary history.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10493-012-9624-z,0
713,Super-predation and intraguild interactions in a multi-predator-one-prey system alter the abundance and behaviour of green peach aphid (Hemiptera: Aphididae),"Abstract The dynamics of interactions amongst natural enemies are central to the investigation of insect pest ecology. Ternary and quaternary interactions between parasitoids and predators in the presence of entomophagous organisms are yet to be comprehensively explored. We investigated the performance of a clone of green peach aphid ( Myzus persicae (Sulzer); Hemiptera: Aphididae), raised on savoy cabbage ( Brassica oleracea Linnaeus; Brassicaceae), under all possible combinations of: I) the parasitoid Aphidius colemani Viereck (Hymenoptera: Braconidae); II) the predator Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae); III) the predator Adalia bipunctata (Linnaeus) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae); and IV) the spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum (Koch) (Araneae: Theridiidae). We demonstrate a considerably differential green peach aphid abundance, polyphenism, and fine-scale spatial distribution in response to the combination, number, and identity of the present enemy species and their interactions. Surprisingly, certain combinations led to thriving green peach aphid populations due to interference between enemies; whereas, other combinations resulted in tangible collective suppression of the population. At the frontier of agroecology and entomology, we provide fresh insights on the effects of conflict and synergy between natural enemies sharing a pest of a cash crop as prey, highlighting the consequences of the presence of a novel synanthropic spider, as a top predator, on pest regulation.",https://doi.org/10.4039/tce.2020.7,0
714,Competition and intraguild egg predation among freshwater snails: re-examining the mechanism of interspecific interactions,"Experimental and field studies suggest that freshwater snail species have negative effects on each other's population growth rates. Because snails share similar diets, these interactions have been interpreted as the result of exploitative competition, but they could also result from intraguild predation. Here we present three experiments aimed at testing the hypothesis that interspecific interactions among three species of freshwater gastropod (Helisoma trivolvis, Physa acuta and Stagnicola elodes) are mediated by intraguild egg predation. Foraging trials, conducted in a laboratory, showed that some snails readily prey on eggs, but the extent of egg predation depended on both the identity of the snail predator and the identity of the egg mass. Of the three species considered, Stagnicola had the largest effect on egg mortality and Physa had no effect on egg mortality. Foraging trials also showed that the eggs of Physa were the most vulnerable to predators and that the eggs of Stagnicola were largely invulnerable. A study conducted in large outdoor mesocosms assessed the occurrence of egg mortality in an environment of more extensive spatial scale and complexity. The results largely mirrored those of the laboratory study, with Stagnicola being the most voracious predator and the eggs of Physa being most vulnerable to predation. The reproductive success of Physa and Stagnicola raised in sympatry and allopatry was assessed in a mesocosm study conducted over three months. Recruitment of both species was depressed in sympatry, but patterns of growth in the survivors suggest contrasting mechanisms of suppression: Physa suppressed Stagnicola via exploitative competition, but Stagnicola suppressed Physa via egg predation. These experiments support the hypothesis that freshwater snail assemblages are structured by strong interspecific interactions and that a rich interplay of egg predation and interspecific competition underlie interactions among the members of this guild.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15883.x,0
715,Size-Dependent Intraguild Reciprocal Predation between Helice Tridens De Haan and H. Japonica Sakai and Yatsuzuka (Decapoda: Grapsidae) as Analyzed in Field Experiments,"Overlap was found between habitats of Helice tridens, primarily an occupant of the upper and lower part of the intertidal areas between MTL (mean tidal level) and MHWS (mean high water spring), and H. japonica, usually restricted to the lower part of the intertidal area of the Shigenobu River Estuary, in southwest Japan. While immature individuals and large-sized adults of H. tridens occurred over the intertidal areas, the young adults of H. tridens were found only in the upper part of the intertidal area. This difference in the pattern of distribution between the young adults and the immature individuals of H. tridens seemed to be derived from interspecific competition or intraguild predation between H. tridens and H. japonica and/or intraspecific interactions within each species. These two species have the same of detritivore and carnivore food habits, and conspecific predation within and/or intraguild reciprocal predation between them were frequently observed in the field. In the present study, we performed field caging experiments to examine the dependence of predation ability on size between the two species. When individuals were |$ \leqq {\rm{7}}{\rm{.0 mm}}$| carapace width (CW), H. japonica had a higher ability to prey on members of H. tridens of the same size than H. tridens had on those of H. japonica. When individuals were |$ \geqq {\rm{8}}{\rm{.0 mm CW}}$|⁠, there was no difference between the two species in terms of predatory ability, and the predation rate itself decreased. Therefore, H. japonica can exclude H. tridens from the lower habitats. However, the large sized individuals of H. tridens may intrude into the lower part of the intertidal area from the upper part. They can be against H. japonica, and can prey on the small sized individuals of H. japonica. However, thick sediment set in the cages increased the survival rate of the small individuals of H. japonica, because burrows dug in the sediment could be refuges for those of H. japonica from the intraguild predation by the large sized individuals of H. tridens. These refuges for the small individuals of H. japonica can be refuges also for those of H. tridens. However, burrows cannot be refuges from intraguild predation between similar-sized individuals of two species of the genus Helice. We can conclude that intraguild predation by H. japonica excluded the immature individuals of H. tridens in the lower habitat and restricted the young adults of H. tridens to the upper habitats in the estuary.",https://doi.org/10.1651/s-2645.1,0
716,Trophic supplements to intraguild predation,"Intraguild predation (IGP) is a dominant community module in terrestrial food webs that occurs when multiple consumers feed both on each other and on a shared prey. This specific form of omnivory is common in terrestrial communities and is of particular interest for conservation biology and biological control given its potential to disrupt management of threatened or pest species. Extensive theory exists to describe the dynamics of three-species IGP, but these models have largely overlooked the potential for other, exterior interactions, to alter the dynamics within the IGP module. We investigated how three forms of feeding outside of the IGP module by intraguild predators (i.e. trophic supplementation) affect the dynamics of the predators (both IG predator and IG prey) and their shared resource. Specifically, we examined how the provision of a constant donor-controlled resource, the availability of an alternative prey species, and predator plant-feeding affect the dynamics of IGP models. All three forms of trophic supplements modified the basic expectations of IGP theory in two important ways, and their effects were similar. First, coexistence was possible without the IG prey being a superior competitor for the original shared resource if the IG prey could effectively exploit one of the types of trophic supplements. However, supplements to the IG predator restricted the potential for coexistence. Second, supplements to the IG prey ameliorated the disruptive effects of the IG predator on the suppression of the shared resource, promoting effective control of the resource in the presence of both predators. Consideration of these three forms of trophic supplementation, all well documented in natural communities, adds substantial realism and predictive power to intraguild predation theory.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.15378.x,0
717,Intraguild predation and coexistence in vertebrate predators,"The abundance of predators and their impact on ecosystem dynamics is a vividly discussed topic in current ecology. In my studies, incorporating field observations, field experiments and theoretical modeling, I explored the importance of predators and predation in a low arctic tundra ecosystem in northern Norway. This involved observing the abundance and spatial activity of predators (raptors and small mustelids); manipulating the abundance of predators (spiders and birds) in an arthropod community; and exploring the theoretical consequences of intraguild predation on the coexistence among predators.The results show that predation is important both in the arthropod assemblage and, depending on the productivity of the community, in the vertebrate assemblage. In arthropod communities predators are at least as abundant as their prey, whereas in the vertebrate part of ecosystem, predators are substantially less abundant than their prey. Still, in both cases predators had strong impact on their prey, influencing the abundance of prey and the species composition of prey assemblages. The impact of predation cascaded to the plant community both in the reticulate and complex arthropod food web and in the linear food chain-like vertebrate community. In the vertebrate-based community we could even observe the long time scale effect on plant community composition.Within the predator community, exploitation competition and intraguild predation were the structuring forces. As the arthropod communities consist of predators with different sizes, intraguild predation is an energetically important interaction for top predators. As a consequence, they reduce the abundance of intermediate predators and the impact of intermediate predators on other prey groups. Moreover, being supported by intermediate predators, top predators can have stronger impact themselves on other prey groups.In vertebrate communities, intraguild predation seems to be unimportant as energetic link, instead it manifests as an extreme version of interference competition. Therefore intraguild predation reduces the likelihood of coexistence, as it is due limited prey diversity and intense exploitative competition already precarious in the low arctic tundra.In conclusion, predators have strong impact on their prey, especially in the more productive parts of the low arctic tundra. This applies even to the food webs with complex and reticulate structure, and these effects carry through the community both in the short time scale of population growth and on the long time scale of population generations.",,0

Neoseiulus barkeri (Hughes) and Scolothrips takahashii (Priesner) are important natural enemies of citrus red mite Panonychus citri (McGregor). However, little was known about their interactions and how the availability of extraguild (EG) prey P. citri modulated their interactions. In this study, we determined incidences of cannibalism and intraguild predation of these two predators when different densities of extraguild prey P. citri were available. Our results showed that incidences of both cannibalism and IGP and were significantly reduced in the presence of the extraguild prey. The intraguild predation between N. barkeri and S. takahashii was bidirectional, but N. barkeri was a predominant intraguild predator over S. takahashii. The S. takahashii fed on immobile N. barkeri egg, and N. barkeri fed on inactive prepupa and pupa of S. takahashii, but the conspecifics seldom did. Our results indicated that the interactions of predators decreased significantly when prey was available. The predatory mite N. barkeri was a stronger interspecific competitor. The results of this study may be useful in developing effective biological control strategies against P. citri.",https://doi.org/10.11158/saa.25.5.1,0
719,Theoretical perspectives on the dynamics of communities with intraguild predation,"Intraguild predation is a widespread interaction between species and can strongly influence communities composition. It occurs when two consumers which share a common resource, and hence compete, also engage into predation. The consumer which can prey on its competitor is often referred to as the intraguild predator while the other is called intraguild prey. In this work we investigate some theoretical aspects about these interactions. First we analyse an experiment with predatory mites which was carried to test patterns of exclusion along a productivity gradient, predicted by theory. Although this experiment was carefully designed to test the theoretical assertions, their results do not agree with theory. Through a very simple model for intraguild predation which serves as a representation of that system, we show that: if the short-term dynamics is taken into account rather than only equilibrium states, in which the usual theory is based, and we consider that populations that attain levels very close to zero are extinct, experimental results meet theory. Then we study questions concerning the influence of different life stages of individuals on the dynamics of intraguild predation. We introduce a model with stage structure in both consumers and consider predation occurring only from adults of the intraguild predator on juveniles of the intraguild prey. This stage dependent interaction was believed to have great effects on the dynamics, once predation pressure on the intraguild prey is reduced, and has been proposed as one feature that could promote coexistence. We check the outcomes of the system along a productivity gradient and show that stage structure do not induce great qualitative changes on the dynamics and the more likely resulting dynamics continues being the extinction of one of the consumers. Predation between consumers can also be reciprocal and this phenomenon is ubiquitous in many systems. In the last part of this work we study a model for reciprocal intraguild predation in a stage structured system. Increasing the attack rates of that consumer which was initially the intraguild prey on the intraguild predator we find that a reciprocal intraguild predation system has a great potential for alternative states in which each consumer can persist isolated with resource, initial conditions determining what consumer will persist.",,0
720,Reciprocal intraguild predation between Neoseiulus barkeri and Amblyseius swirskii (Mesostigmata: Phytoseiidae): Does experience affect anti-intraguild predation behaviors?,"In order to increase their inclusive fitness, animals predominantly probe their changing environment for predation cues to adopt appropriate antipredator strategies and decrease the costs of defensive behavior. Intraguild predation (IGP) occurs when a predator kills and consumes individuals of another predator which is its competitor for a shared prey. IGP is prevalent among predatory mites of the family Phytoseiidae which are used as biological control agents of agricultural pests worldwide. Phytoseiid mite mothers usually display antipredator behaviors to avoid or reduce IGP risk of their juveniles. When facing a novel IGP risk, experience may enable the mothers to display more efficient antipredator responses. We studied the effect of experience on reciprocal antipredator behaviors of an indigenous predatory phytoseiid mite, i.e., Neoseiulus barkeri Hughes, and an exotic one, i.e., Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot, as biological control candidates for integrated pest management strategies in Iran. First, we determined the occurrence of IGP and mutual risk of the predators within the guild; IGP occurred reciprocally and A. swirskii was the stronger IG predator. Second, in choice situations between a patch with only shared prey and a patch with shared prey plus IGP risk cues, we scrutinized patch choice, oviposition site selection and ability to counterattack by females of each species that had either experienced the IGP risk or not. The experience did not affect patch choice and oviposition behaviors of the species whereas it elicited an increase in their predation on IG predator juveniles. We suggest that the presence of IG predator juveniles and cues may not significantly modify the distribution of the IG prey species. The reinforced counterattack behavior in experienced females showed that both species were able to tune their antipredator behavior after exposure to IG predators. Consequences of the antipredator behaviors in experienced IG prey females on distribution and possibilities of the coexistence of the study species are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.22073/pja.v7i1.33806,0
721,Intraguild Predation Model with Stage Structure and Cannibalism in Prey Population,"This paper concerns an intraguild predator model with stage structure and cannibalism in the prey population, where the prey population is divided into two stages, namely, a juvenile stage, and an adult stage. We investigated the dynamics of this model. We obtained the quilibrium points, the conditions of existence, and the condition for stability using the Jacobian matrix and Routh Hurwitz criterion. We use numerical simulation to illustrate the dynamics of the model over time. Furthermore, we illustrate the effects of the maturation rate on the adult prey population and the carrying capacity of the basal resources on the existence and stability region of the model. We also analysed the transcritical bifurcation with the maturation rate selected as the primary bifurcation parameter. We demonstrate herein that each equilibriumpoint undergoes stability switching of the equilibria with the change of maturation rate either from stable to unstable to stable, or unstable to stable to unstable. The obtained result indicates that a large maturation rate can lead to a system where the prey population can escape from predation yet negatively impacts the survival rate of basal resources in the ecosystem. Whereas, an intermediate maturation rate indicates that the species could co-exist whereby theoretically, it can ensure that the optimal predator population exists in the ecosystem. This is in parallel able to stabilise the effect of overpopulation of predators with competition factor. An ecosystem with all species coexists could ensure a healthy ecological interaction for a sustainable environment.",https://doi.org/10.11113/matematika.v38.n2.1410,0
722,Intraguild Predation Under Allochthonous Aquatic Input in Tropical Rainforest,"Allochthonous resources are donor controllers that can affect trophic interactions in recipient food webs. For instance, tri-trophic interactions could experience destabilization in the absence of those resources. In a riparian rainforest, we found that intraguild predation between top predators and mesopredators depended on the input of allochthonous resources. In the exclusion of emergent aquatic insects, spiders experienced strong predation pressure by birds and bats. Consequently, spider density and richness decreased enormously. However, spider density and richness did not decrease when emergent aquatic insects were present, showing the important subsidy that those allochthonous resources provided and their role in food web stability.

We present a two-patch model. We assume that on one patch two species compete for a common resource, and on the other patch one species can capture the other one for the maintenance. We also assume IGP individuals are able to migrate between the two patches and the migration process acts on a fast time scale in comparison with demography, predation and competition processes.

724,Spider mites avoid caterpillar traces to prevent intraguild predation,"Abstract The phytophagous spider mites Tetranychus kanzawai and Tetranychus urticae can be as small as &lt;0.5 mm; thus, they are often incidentally consumed along with food plant leaves by voracious lepidopteran larvae (hereafter, ‘caterpillars’). Therefore, the ability to avoid such intraguild predation should confer a selective advantage to mites. We experimentally demonstrated that adult females of both mite species avoided settling on food plant leaves with traces of all tested caterpillar species ( Bombyx mori , Papilio xuthus , Spodoptera litura and Theretra oldenlandiae ). We examined additional interactions using B. mori and T. kanzawai and found that B. mori trace avoidance by T. kanzawai lasted for more than 48 h. Tetranychus kanzawai also avoided B. mori traces on plant stems, along which mites access leaves. Moreover, T. kanzawai avoided acetone extracts of B. mori traces applied to filter paper, indicating that chemical substances of caterpillar traces are responsible for the avoidance. This study is the first demonstration of a repellent effect of herbivore trace chemicals on heterospecific herbivores. Although spider mites have developed resistance against many synthetic pesticides, these results predict that natural compounds simulating caterpillar traces may repel spider mites from agricultural crops.",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2086743/v1,0
725,Modeling and analysis of a three-species food web with facilitated and intraguild predation,"Biotic interactions are known to shape natural community assemblages and biodiversity. Positive interactions such as facilitation have recently received attention in ecological food webs. Mechanistic models have improved our understanding of these complex food web interactions. Here, focus is given to a three-species food web system with a beach dune natural community in mind. In the last decade, there has been a series of studies investigating intraguild predation between two major loggerhead sea turtle nest predators, North American raccoons and Atlantic ghost crabs. Studies have also highlighted that ghost crab predation assists raccoons in finding nests (i.e., facilitated predation). However, the combined effects of these two intraguild interactions and their consequences on nests have not been examined explicitly. The aims of this study were to (i) develop a three-species, ordinary differential equation model (ii) implement a sensitivity analysis to understand the influence of facilitation and other factors in driving species richness and abundance and (iii) characterize the dynamic interactions between intraguild predators and their effects on a shared resource. Interactions between ghost crabs and sea turtle eggs and facilitation can yield a wide variety of species abundance responses and were influential factors in the model. I found that high secondary sea turtle egg depredation and low facilitated predation by raccoons led to three species co-existence regions in the model. Controlling for nest predators at higher abundance levels showed that ghost crabs had a larger negative effect on sea turtle egg abundance responses when compared to raccoons. This suggests that interactions between sea turtle eggs and ghost crabs appear to be important and potential sea turtle nest management implications are discussed such as the use of ghost crab exclusion devices.",,0
726,When an insecticide affects the adaptive value of intraguild predation by an invader,"Abstract Biological invasions can generate major ecological disturbances, such as changes in species diversity and structure of communities. It is believed that the multicolored Asian ladybeetle, Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Col, Coccinellidae), recognized as one of the most invasive insects in the world, has reduced native coccinellids populations in several areas and is considered as a threat for biodiversity at large. A significant trait, favoring its invasiveness and its dominance over indigenous ladybeetles, is intraguild predation (IGP). IGP has advantageous adaptive value for individuals, removing competitors, potential predators and providing an alternative nutritive resource, when main resources are scarce. Previous research demonstrated that this invasive ladybeetle is highly susceptible to the reduced-risk insecticide novaluron, a chitin synthesis inhibitor, whereas the North American indigenous competitor, Coleomegilla maculata DeGeer (Col, Coccinellidae), is not. Our study explores the adaptive value of IGP for each of the two coccinellids after preying on each other’s larvae, previously treated with insecticide. Our first hypothesis is that the invasive ladybeetle, susceptible to the insecticide, should lose the adaptive value of IGP, while the native predator not. Our second hypothesis is that the adaptive value of IGP for the invasive predator will be recovered over time, as a result of neutralisation of the insecticide by the intraguild prey (native species). The results support both hypotheses, and show that an insecticide can completely remove the adaptive value of IGP for the invader, while it does not change for the indigenous ladybeetle. Moreover, the study demonstrates that if the intraguild prey (non-susceptible to the insecticide) undergoes molt after being exposed to the insecticide, the adaptive value for the intraguild predator is restored.",https://doi.org/10.1101/349852,0
727,Intraguild predation between Harmonia axyridis and the hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus,"Whereas Harmonia axyridis has frequently been reported as an intraguild predator of other Coccinellidae, little is known about its interactions with other aphidophagous predators, including syrphids. This study investigated the incidence, direction and magnitude of intraguild predation (IGP) between H. axyridis and Episyrphus balteatus in Petri dish arenas with leaf disks on agar. The interactions were examined between larvae, pupae and adults, both in the absence and presence of Acyrthosiphon pisum as an extraguild prey. _x000D_
IGP between H. axyridis and E. balteatus was asymmetric, with the coccinellid in the majority of cases being the IG predator and the syrphid the IG prey. In the absence of extraguild prey, first instars of E. balteatus were most sensitive to IGP, as they were killed by all stages of H. axyridis. Second and third instars of the syrphid were only killed by older larvae and adults of the coccinellid. Pupae of either species were not attacked. In the presence of extraguild prey, the frequency of IGP was substantially reduced. Further research using larger arenas is needed to get a more reliable view on the interactions between these predators.",,0
728,Spider mites avoid caterpillar traces to prevent intraguild predation,"The phytophagous spider mites Tetranychus kanzawai and Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae) can be as small as &lt; 0.5 mm; thus, they are often incidentally consumed along with food plant leaves by voracious lepidopteran larvae (hereafter, ‘caterpillars’; Shirotsuka and Yano, 2012). Therefore, the ability to avoid such intraguild predation should confer a selective advantage to mites. We experimentally demonstrated that adult females of both mite species avoided settling on food plant leaves with traces of all tested caterpillar species (Bombyx mori, Papilio xuthus, Spodoptera litura, and Theretra oldenlandiae). We examined additional interactions using B. mori and T. kanzawai and found that B. mori trace avoidance by T. kanzawai lasted for more than 48 h. Tetranychus kanzawai also avoided B. mori traces on plant stems, along which mites access leaves. Moreover, T. kanzawai avoided acetone extracts of B. mori traces applied to filter paper, indicating that chemical substances of caterpillar traces are responsible for the avoidance. This study is the first demonstration of a repellent effect of herbivore trace chemicals on heterospecific herbivores. Although spider mites have developed resistance against many synthetic pesticides (Attia et al., 2013; Van Leeuwen et al., 2010), this study showed the potential of using natural compounds simulating caterpillar traces in repelling spider mites from agricultural crops.",https://doi.org/10.11646/zoosymposia.22.1.184,0
729,Evidence of Intraguild Predation in a Snake Assemblage: Bigger Seems Better,"Intraguild predation can play a significant role in structuring species composition with intraguild prey under both competitive and predatory pressure from intraguild predators. How intraguild prey are able to persist at sites with their predators is a complex issue with empirical evidence not always supporting theoretical models, indicating a need for more in situ research. A prominent grassland predator in the south central region of Pennsylvania, Coluber constrictor constrictor (Northern Black Racer), co-occurs with potential prey snakes including Lampropeltis triangulum (Eastern Milksnake) and Thamnophis sirtalis sirtalis (Eastern Gartersnake). Starting in 2008, this 7-year study examined how intraguild predation may differentially influence the body size and demographic traits of prey species in south-central Pennsylvania at sites with and without Northern Black Racers. The body size of adult Eastern Milksnakes was unaffected by the presence of racers. Eastern Milksnakes were more abundant, but with fewer juveniles, at racer-present sites. Adult female Eastern Gartersnakes were larger in body size, and adult males were less frequently encountered, in racer-present sites. These results indicate that intraguild predation in a snake community may affect the body size and demographic traits of prey species differentially, likely through predatory exclusion. However, the exact mechanisms behind our findings, and the resulting dynamics of snake diversity, are unclear and require further analyses.",https://doi.org/10.1656/045.028.0302,0
730,Biological control of cereal aphids in wheat: Implications of alternative foods and intraguild predation,"The overall objective of this proposal is to understand how realistic strategies for incorporating alternative foods into wheat fields affect the intraguild (IG) interactions of omnivorous and carnivorous predators and their efficacy as biological control agents. Cereal aphids are a primary pest of wheat throughout much of the world. Naturally occurring predator communities consume large quantities of cereal aphids in wheat, and are partitioned into aphid specialists and omnivores. Within wheat fields, the relative abilities of omnivorous and carnivorous predators to reduce cereal aphids depend heavily on the availability, distribution and type of alternative foods (alternative prey, sugar, and pollen), and on the intensity and direction of IG predation events within this community. A series of eight synergistic experiments, carefully crafted to accomplish objectives while accounting for regional production practices, will be conducted to explore how cover crops (US, where large fields preclude effective use of field margins) and field margins (IS, where cover crops are not feasible) as sources of alternative foods affect the IG interactions of predators and their efficacy as biological control agents. These objectives are: 1. Determine the mechanisms whereby the availability of alternative prey and plant-provided resources affect pest suppression by omnivorous and carnivorous generalist predators; 2. Characterize the intensity of IGP within generalist predator communities of wheat systems and assess the impact of these interactions on cereal aphid predation; and 3. Evaluate how spatial patterns in the availability of non-prey resources and IGP affect predation on cereal aphids by generalist predator communities. To accomplish these goals, novel tools, including molecular and biochemical gut content analysis and geospatial analysis, will be coupled with traditional techniques used to monitor and manipulate insect populations and predator efficacy. Our approach will manipulate key alternative foods and IG prey to determine how these individual interactions contribute to the ability of predators to suppress cereal aphids within systems where cover crop and field margin management strategies are evaluated in production scale plots. Using these strategies, the proposed project will not only provide cost-effective and realistic solutions for pest management issues faced by IS and US producers, but also will provide a better understanding of how spatial dispersion, IG predation, and the availability of alternative foods contribute to biological control by omnivores and carnivores within agroecosystems. By reducing the reliance of wheat producers on insecticides, this proposal will address the BARD priorities of increasing the efficiency of agricultural production and protecting plants against biotic sources of stress in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner.",https://doi.org/10.32747/2014.7699858.bard,0
731,"Intraguild predation and conservation of endangered seabirds. modelling, theory and nonstandard approximations","Seabirds breeding on islands are vulnerable to introduced predators, such as rats and cats, and the removal of such predators is generally viewed as a priority for seabird conservation and restoration. However, multiple invasive mammal species interacting may generate unexpected outcomes following the removal (eradication) of one species. Generally these indirect interactions are not well understood or demonstrated. We propose and study a prey (seabird)-mesopredator (rat)-superpredator (cat) model, taking into account the juvenile stages in the prey population, in order to direct conservation management for seabird conservation [4,5]. We give a more biologically realistic di_erential system than those studied before [2,3], in particular for long-lived seabird species. We present a theoretical study and show existence and uniqueness of a positive solution as well as a qualitative study of the equilibria that may appear [5]. Because standard numerical methods, usually implemented in scienti_c softwares, like Scilab or Matlab, can fail to give the right biological approximations [1,5], we propose a reliable algorithm that preserves most of the qualitative properties of the continuous system, using the theory of nonstandard _nite di_erence methods. We illustrate our approach with Barau's Petrel, an endemic seabird from Reunion Island. (Resume d'auteur)",,0
732,Influence of Alternative Prey on the Functional Response of a Predator in Two Contexts: With and without Intraguild Predation,"In biological control, joint releases of predators and parasitoids are standard. However, intraguild predation (IGP) can occur when a predator attacks a parasitoid, potentially affecting pest control dynamics. In addition to the focal prey (FP), Trialeurodes vaporariorum, the intraguild predator (IG-predator) Geocoris punctipes can consume the parasitoid Eretmocerus eremicus (IG-prey). In this IGP context with multiple prey, an alternative prey (AP), like the aphid Myzus persicae, may influence interactions. Theory predicts that, in simple interactions, a predator’s functional response (FR) to the FP changes with the presence of an AP. However, whether this holds in an IGP context is unknown. In this study, we empirically tested that prediction. Our results show that without IGP, G. punctipes exhibits a generalized FR with and without AP. Nevertheless, with IGP, the predator exhibited a Type II FR at low and high AP densities, increasing pressure on the FP and potentially favoring short-term biological control strategies. However, when 25 AP were offered, the predator’s response shifted, underscoring the importance of monitoring AP densities to prevent potential disruptions in FP control. In both contexts, the increase in AP produced a handling time increase and a decrease in consumption rate. These results indicate that the theoretical prediction of the effect of AP on the FR is met only under specific conditions, and the complexity of multitrophic interactions must be considered.",https://doi.org/10.3390/insects15050315,0
733,Effects of Basal-Resource Augmentation on Intraguild Predation and Decomposition in a Soil Food Web,"Intraguild predation (IGP) is a ubiquitous omnivory module that can be a bottom-up and top-down force in community structuring. A two-year experiment was completed at The Morton Arboretum in Lisle, IL to answer, how does artificial basal resource enhancement change soil microarthropod community structure and role of IGP as a community-structuring force, and how do these changes affect microbial activity? Two hundred 1 m2-plots received one of three levels of detrital enhancement intended to increase the abundance of saprophytic fungi. A large increase in abundance of small-sized fungivore prey observed both at the end of year 1 and year 2. The mite family Parasitidae, a large predator, increased in abundance in response to fungivores at the end of year 1. At the end of year 2, the increase large predator abundance was more pronounced. Path analyses revealed IGP was the most influential structuring force in the Low-level enhancement group at the end of year 1. In year 2, IGP was observed in all treatment groups and was the only significant interaction in Low-level treatment plots. A proxy for microbial activity, cotton strip tensile strength loss (CSTL), was highest in High-level enhancement plots than any other treatment, followed by Low-level enhancement plots. A path analysis revealed that fungivores in communities receiving Low-levels of enhancement had a negative effect on CSTL. This suggests strong inhibition of microbial activity resulting from a combined effect of lesser microbial growth from Low enhancement plus intraguild predation that reduced predation on the fungivore common resource.",,0
734,Potency of Intraguild Predation to Disrupt the Optimum Functions of Predatory Arthropods: An Ecological Perspective,"Some empirical studies have revealed the ecological consequence of interspecific relationships among predatory arthropods that is the disruption of natural functions of indigenous species of predators on their preys, i.e. phytophagous arthropods. In relation to many efforts on the utilization of introduced species of natural enemies, particularly predatory arthropods, the effects oflntraguild Predation (IGP) on key predators should be considered carefully to optimize their potency. In addition, understanding the impact of biological traits of each species of predatory arthropods on their ability to adapt from being predated by other species might be important to predict their composition and possibilities for being exist in ecosystem.",https://doi.org/10.22146/jpti.12075,0
735,Predator life history affects persistence times of predators and consumers in an intraguild predation system,"Size-dependent differences between individuals in size-structured organisms have fundamental effect on population and community dynamics. Intraguild predation (IGP) is one specifically interesting constellation that often arises when two size-structured populations interact. Ontogenetic bottlenecks that determine population size-structure are affected by both population intrinsic as well as population extrinsic factors, and are therefore context-dependent. Surprisingly, size-structured IGP systems have mainly been investigated theoretically and especially long-term empirical studies are widely lacking. In this thesis I investigate empirically how habitat complexity, interaction strength, and stage-specific resource availabilities affect population processes and their effects on the dynamics of a size-structured IGP system. I conducted multi-generation experiments in a size-structured IGP system, with the Least Killifish (Heterandria formosa) as IG prey and the Common Guppy (Poecilia reticulata) as IG predator. With no alternative resource next to the shared resource, IG predator and IG prey could not coexist. Weak interactions only increased IG prey and IG predator persistence times and observed exclusion patterns depended on habitat complexity. An alternative resource for either the juvenile IG predator or the juvenile IG prey on the other hand promoted coexistence. However, this coexistence was context-dependent. Ontogenetic bottlenecks played a central role in the dynamics of the size-structured IGP system in general. In the final study I show that an ontogenetic bottleneck can, through changes in stage-specific resource availabilities, be affected in a way that leads to increased trophic transfer efficiency with potential effects on higher trophic levels.Overall, the results emphasize importance of the broader context in which size-structured communities are embedded. Especially, when managing natural communities it is important to account for the combined effects of size-structure, stage-specific resource availabilities, and habitat structure. Specifically, when managing species that connect habitats or ecosystems all life-stages’ environmental conditions must be consider in order to ensure strong predictive power of tools used for ecosystem management planning.",,0
736,Effects of Temperature and Extraguild Prey Density on Intraguild Predation of Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis,"The ladybirds Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis are important biocontrol agents for the small walnut aphid Chromaphis juglandicola, a key walnut pest. C. juglandicola outbreaks occur in walnut orchards, and walnut yields have declined. Intraguild predation (IGP) is prevalent among natural enemies that coexist in shared habitats and prey upon the same extraguild prey. We designed laboratory experiments to evaluate the potential for IGP between these two ladybirds at different temperatures and extraguild (EG) prey densities, and the ability of IGP to control EG prey under different conditions. We measured IGP rates in first instar larvae, female adults, and male adults (both starved for 24 h) in the vulnerable immature life stages of two ladybird eggs. Intraguild (IG) prey (H. axyridis eggs or C. septempunctata eggs) and EG prey (C. juglandicola) consumption were tallied after 24 h. Temperature and EG prey density influenced IGP rates, with temperature contributing the most to the variance. IGP increased with increasing temperature (15–35 °C), with both factors interactively influencing the EG prey consumption rate and exhibiting highly significant effects. EG prey consumption increased with temperature and density. This research provides theoretical support for the rational use of H. axyridis and C. septempunctata in the joint biological control of C. juglandicola",https://doi.org/10.3390/insects16010062,0
737,Intraguild predation among snails drives human schistosome amplification despite susceptible host regulation,"Competitors and predators of hosts have the potential to alter transmission dynamics within host-parasite systems. Biocontrol aims to harness these effects to mitigate diseases of human or agricultural importance, but without a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of how hosts and non-hosts interact over time these attempts may backfire. We investigated the role that two resource competitors that have been employed in biocontrol, Melanoides tuberculata and Physa acuta, play in the Biomphalaria glabrata-Schistosoma mansoni system. We created experimental communities with differing compositions in mesocosms and tracked resource availability, host snail abundance, size, reproduction, and parasite production over 16 weeks. We found that Melanoides acted as a typical, albeit weak, resource competitor of Biomphalaria, reducing host body size and per capita cercarial production but with no appreciable influence on host abundance. Physa, however, reduced host abundance but increased resource availability and cercarial production, which represents biocontrol failure and is inconsistent with solely acting as a resource competitor. In follow-up experiments, we determined that Physa is a voracious consumer of host eggs. We then built a model representing this intraguild predation effect, which was able to explain these initially counterintuitive results. These divergent results from two putative resource competitors of host snails underscore the importance of establishing the mechanisms through which hosts, non-hosts, and parasites interact, especially for anticipating the potential outcomes of biocontrol interventions.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.17.629011,0
738,Relevance of diet diversification in the coexistence between Orius laevigatus and Amblyseius swirskii: prey switching and intraguild predation,"Abstract Omnivores obtain resources from more than one trophic level, choosing food based on quantity and quality. They usually engage in intraguild predation (IGP) when prey is scarce. Orius laevigatus is an example of omnivore that becomes superior predator of the predatory mite Amblyseius swirskii when released in a combined system under low levels of the preferred prey, the thrips Frankliniella occidentalis . Here, we test two genetically enhanced O. laevigatus strains for bigger size and better fitness feeding on pollen (BIG30 and 2POL-11, respectively), hence with a wider dietary diversification, to elucidate the potential effects on prey preference and IGP on the predatory mite, in comparison with a commercial population of O. laevigatus . To do that, predation rates were registered on adult phytoseiids solely or in a choice situation at different availability ratios of adult thrips under laboratory conditions. The effect of pollen as supplemental food on IGP and prey preference was examined, too. We found that our two enhanced lines killed up to 9% less predatory mites and fed preferably on adult thrips, compared to the commercial population. While BIG30 showed a significantly higher total predation rate, killing up to 150% more adult thrips, 2POL-11 is defined as an efficient user of resources, switching between different prey and pollen showing low IGP. Pollen supplementation had a significant effect on reducing IGP, but only for 2POL-11 the influence on prey preference was significant. The theory of intraguild predation and the impact of prey switching on food webs and biological control strategies are also discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10340-024-01762-5,0
739,Modeling effects of habitat structure on intraguild predation frequency and spatial coexistence between jaguars and ocelots,"Abstract Species within the same ecological guild exhibit niche attributes that vary in association with their diet, spatial occupancy, and temporal activity to reduce competition. In the case of the tropical felid community, many species exhibit substantial overlap in these niche dimensions. Consequently, jaguars (Panthera onca) will sometimes kill the smaller ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) competitor in a phenomenon called intraguild predation (IGP), which is a major structuring force in tropical forests. We developed a spatially explicit agent-based model to understand IGP with the expectation that ocelots employ spatial avoidance strategies using available forest canopy as the more arboreal species. We parameterized model agents with realistic behaviors to replicate the real-world environment. Jaguar and ocelot agents were allowed to move, hunt, and reproduce with varying numbers, heights, and canopy thickness of trees as we recorded IGP events and ocelot canopy occupancy. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to demonstrate how the number and height of trees significantly affected IGP occurrence. In accordance with our hypothesis, we found that the main contributor mediating coexistence between the two species was spatial avoidance of jaguars by ocelots by using available canopy refuges. Our modeling approach has broad application to different environments with similar intraguild interactions to predict the importance of forest structure and can inform policy directed toward forest management and habitat conservation.",https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arad080,0
740,Impact of egg-quality and its laying pattern on the fate of egg-cannibalism and intraguild predation in ladybirds,"We investigated the impact of egg-quality and its laying pattern on the incidence of cannibalism and intraguild predation in ladybirds. We manipulated quality by using two species of ladybirds’ eggs and the pattern of egg-laying by arranging the eggs singly or in cluster and using second, third and fourth instar larva of two ladybird species, Coccinella septempunctata L. and Menochilus sexmaculatus (Fabricius), as predators. We found that second instars of both ladybird species indulged in egg-cannibalism, whereas third and fourth instars were potential intraguild predators and consumed heterospecific eggs. On the other hand, linearly arranged and clustered eggs of M. sexmaculatus were least protected by higher instars of C. septempunctata, while clustered eggs of C. septempunctata got a refuge from M. sexmaculatus higher stage larvae due to aposematism in eggs. It is concluded that C. septempunctata was an intraguild predator of eggs of M. sexmaculatus in starved conditions, and the egg-quality and pattern of egg-laying can affect the fate of egg-cannibalism and intraguild predation.",https://doi.org/10.22271/j.ento.2022.v10.i5d.9069,0
741,An Experimental Framework for Determining the Degree of Intraguild Predation in a Three-Species Omnivorous Food Web in the Field,"Abstract Intraguild predation (IGP) is common in natural and human-managed systems and plays a critical role in food web dynamics. Previous studies have documented the occurrence of IGP across a wide range of predator taxa, yet there is still a lack of quantitative understanding regarding the degree/intensity of IGP in these systems. Here, I propose an experimental framework combining controlled feeding trials and stable isotope analysis to determine the degree of IGP in a three-species omnivorous food web (shared prey + mesopredator + top predator) in the field. The degree of IGP is defined herein as the proportion (in number) of mesopredator consumed in the total diet (shared prey + mesopredator) of top predator. The feeding trials are used to construct a standard curve for the degree of IGP in the focal system, to which the stable isotope signatures of field samples are compared to estimate the degree of IGP in the field. The proposed framework leverages the strengths of different experimental approaches to studying trophic interactions, providing a useful tool for quantifying IGP in a more accurate (controlled feeding trials and standard IGP curve) and realistic (stable isotope analysis of field samples) fashion. If proven successful, the current framework can be extended to food webs involving more complex interactions (e.g., cannibalism and multiple shared prey) and further complemented with other approaches (e.g., molecular gut content analysis) to capture a more complete picture of IGP dynamics in the field.",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1268955/v1,0
742,Kit foxes demonstrate adaptive compromise characteristics under intraguild predation pressure by coyotes in the Great Basin desert,"Abstract Coyotes ( Canis latrans ) are believed to contribute to declining kit fox ( Vulpes macrotis ) numbers in the Great Basin desert through intraguild predation. Intraguild prey have been shown to exhibit adaptive compromise, whereby an animal increases selection for risky, but food-rich areas during times of food stress (i.e. winter). We evaluated the habitat selection of kit foxes in the Great Basin desert to elucidate if they demonstrated adaptive compromise as a method of coexisting with coyotes. We created 2nd order resource selection functions to analyze kit fox habitat selection associated with coyote relative probability of use (RPU), prey abundance, and type of soil substrate. In the summer, we found that kit fox selection for areas of relatively more abundant prey was not significant, and there was a small positive selection for coyote RPU. In the winter, we found a positive relationship between kit fox selection and prey abundance as well as a stronger selection for coyote RPU. These findings do follow the pattern of adaptive compromise. We also found kit foxes selected for silty and sandy soils, which are conducive to den construction, as they use dens seasonally for breeding but also year-round for multiple uses, including refugia from predators and extreme heat. Soil substrate appeared to be an important factor impacting kit fox habitat selection.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-61692-1,0

Feeding trials along with stable isotope analysis are used to construct a standard curve of the relationship between top predator’s diet and shift in its nitrogen isotope signatures. The nitrogen isotope signatures of field-sampled top predator individuals are then analyzed and interpolated to the curve to estimate the degree of IGP in the field. The proposed framework leverages the strengths of different experimental approaches to studying trophic interactions, providing a tool for quantifying IGP in a more accurate (controlled feeding trials and standard IGP curve) and realistic (stable isotope analysis of field samples) fashion.

744,Three-Prey Switching Behavior of Two Generalist Predators with Asymmetric Intraguild Predation: A Coyote-Fox-Two Rodents System,"Living species interact with each other in complex food webs, mostly via predation, a phenomenon that prompted many modeling research studies. Previous work has addressed one predator and multi-prey systems. Especially, plasticity of the predator's feeding behavior in the presence of several prey, called switching, has been taken into account in some models. The present work focuses on the extension of these latter models incorporating several predators. For this purpose, we incorporate intraguild predation (a prey and a predator sharing the same prey), a well-known multi-predator effect. This model work is emphasized by a concrete application on a system in North America composed of coyote as top predator and red fox as intermediate predator and two rodent species, meadow vole and deer mouse, as prey. Both predators are generalist opportunistic. The proposed model is described by ordinary differential equations and multi-prey Holling type III functional responses. We explore the dynamics of this system in three ecological contexts marked by different densities of the species: rural, rural during outbreaks of voles (this species is known to peak and cycle regularly) and finally in urban areas. In the latter situation food resources for predators alternative to rodents are more abundant compared to rural areas. In the different studied contexts, the simulations showed a convergence to the coexistence of all the species in the long time. The interesting phenomenon of 3-prey switching is observed.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4651514,0
745,"Supplementary material from ""Temporal shifts in intraguild predation pressure between beluga whales and Greenland halibut in a changing Arctic""","Asymmetrical intraguild predation (AIGP), which combines both predation and competition between predator species, is pervasive in nature with relative strengths varying by prey availability. But with species redistributions associated with climate change, the response by endemic predators within an AIGP context to changing biotic–abiotic conditions over time (i.e. seasonal and decadal) has yet to be quantified. Furthermore, little is known on AIGP dynamics in ecosystems undergoing rapid directional change such as the Arctic. Here, we investigate the flexibility of AIGP among two predators in the same trophic guild: beluga ( Delphinapterus leucas ) and Greenland halibut ( Reinhardtius hippoglossoides ), by season and over 30-years in Cumberland Sound—a system where forage fish capelin ( Mallotus villosus ) have recently become more available. Using stable isotopes, we illustrate different predator responses to temporal shifts in forage fish availability. On a seasonal cycle, beluga consumed less Greenland halibut and increased consumption of forage fish during summer, contrasting a constant consumption rate of forage fish by Greenland halibut year-round leading to decreased AIGP pressure between predators. Over a decadal scale (1982–2012), annual consumption of forage fish by beluga increased with a concomitant decline in the consumption of Greenland halibut, thereby indicating decreased AIGP pressure between predators in concordance with increased forage fish availability. The long-term changes of AIGP pressure between endemic predators illustrated here highlights climate-driven environmental alterations to interspecific intraguild interactions in the Arctic.",https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3917944.v2,0
746,Intraguild predation between two predatory mites Neoseiulus cucumeris Oudemans (Phytoseiidae) and Blattisocius dentriticus Berlese (Blattisociidae),"Different species not only can compete with each other for food and space but also prey on competitors. Intraguild predation is where individuals prey on other competing species. Nevertheless, intraguild predation may cause adverse influence between biocontrol agents targeting the same pest. The generalist predator Blattisocius dentriticus recently invaded and excluded our culture of Neoseiulus cucumeris. Additionally, the presence of B. dentriticus females’ cues has prolonged the development time and consumption of N. cucumeris males (Gu et al., 2022). Therefore, the potential for intraguild predation between the two predatory mites, N. cucumeris and B. dentriticus, was investigated. Laboratory experiments were conducted using a no-choice test and a population test in the presence of their shared prey, Tyrophagus putrescentiae Schrank. Like other phytoseiid species, intraguild predation between N. cucumeris and B. dentriticus is mutual though they are asymmetric in size. Blattisocius dentriticus was larger than N. cucumeris, based on their dorsal shield lengths of the same sex and life stage, and superior than N. cucumeris in intraguild predation. In the no-choice test, B. dentriticus adults consumed N. cucumeris at all life stages, while N. cucumeris adults (i.e. females) preyed only on immature B. dentriticus. Body size was found to be a major factor affecting the direction of intraguild predation: intraguild predators were larger than intraguild prey they consumed. In the population experiment, B. dentriticus eliminated N. cucumeris despite the different starting populations of the two species. Our laboratory study suggests that B. dentriticus may adversely impact N. cucumeris through direct (i.e. intraguild predation) and indirect interactions.",https://doi.org/10.11646/zoosymposia.22.1.71,0
747,Open Access: Intraguild predation between Pristionchus pacificus and Caenorhabditis elegans: a complex interaction with the potential for aggressive behaviour,"The related nematodes Pristionchus pacificus and Caenorhabditis elegans both eat bacteria for nutrition and are therefore competitors when they exploit the same bacterial resource. In addition to competing with each other, P. pacificus is a predator of C. elegans larval prey. These two relationships together form intraguild predation, which is the killing and sometimes eating of potential competitors. In killing C. elegans, the intraguild predator P. pacificus may achieve dual benefits of immediate nutrition and reduced competition for bacteria. Recent studies of P. pacificus have characterized many aspects of its predatory biting behaviour as well as underlying molecular and genetic mechanisms. However, little has been explored regarding the potentially competitive aspect of P. pacificus biting C. elegans. Moreover, aggression may also be implicated if P. pacificus intentionally bites C. elegans with the goal of reducing competition for bacteria.

749,Beluga-Halibut-Si-Data from Temporal shifts in intraguild predation pressure between beluga whales and Greenland halibut in a changing Arctic,"Asymmetrical intraguild predation (AIGP), which combines both predation and competition between predator species, is pervasive in nature with relative strengths varying by prey availability. But with species redistributions associated with climate change, the response by endemic predators within an AIGP context to changing biotic–abiotic conditions over time (i.e. seasonal and decadal) has yet to be quantified. Furthermore, little is known on AIGP dynamics in ecosystems undergoing rapid directional change such as the Arctic. Here, we investigate the flexibility of AIGP among two predators in the same trophic guild: beluga (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) and Greenland halibut (<i>Reinhardtius hippoglossoides</i>), by season and over 30-years in Cumberland Sound—a system where forage fish capelin (<i>Mallotus villosus</i>) have recently become more available. Using stable isotopes, we illustrate different predator responses to temporal shifts in forage fish availability. On a seasonal cycle, beluga consumed less Greenland halibut and increased consumption of forage fish during summer, contrasting a constant consumption rate of forage fish by Greenland halibut year-round leading to decreased AIGP pressure between predators. Over a decadal scale (1982–2012), annual consumption of forage fish by beluga increased with a concomitant decline in the consumption of Greenland halibut, thereby indicating decreased AIGP pressure between predators in concordance with increased forage fish availability. The long-term changes of AIGP pressure between endemic predators illustrated here highlights climate-driven environmental alterations to interspecific intraguild interactions in the Arctic.",https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5555152.v1,0
750,Fitness consequences of intraguild predation between <i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i> (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and <i>Ostrinia furnacalis</i> (Lepidoptera: Crambidae),"Abstract The introduction of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), into Thailand has significantly altered the dynamics of maize pests. It has overshadowed Ostrinia furnacalis (Guenée) (Asian corn borer) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), previously the most severe maize insect in Thailand. This transition is postulated to stem from the superior intraguild predation (IGP) capabilities of S. frugiperda. To validate this supposition, we assessed the co-distribution patterns and damage locales of both pests within maize fields and analyzed the IGP’s repercussions on their larval growth, survival, and fecundity. Our findings demonstrate that: (i) incidence of O. furnacalis in maize fields is markedly reduced following the introduction of S. frugiperda; (ii) abundance of S. frugiperda and O. furnacalis is negatively correlated in field; (iii) interspecific interactions affect the spatial distributions of S. frugiperda and O. furnacalis on shared plants; (iv) S. frugiperda has lower generation time and higher fecundity; and (v) IGP amplifies the growth rate of S. frugiperda and elevates mortality in O. furnacalis. Moreover, in response to the competitive pressure exerted by S. frugiperda, O. furnacalis exhibited expedited molting and growth without a commensurate increase in size. Our data suggest IGP proficiency underpins S. frugiperda’s dominance in Thai maize fields. We propose a niche differentiation on spatiotemporal distribution facilitating the coexistence of S. frugiperda and O. furnacalis. The impact of S. frugiperda on pest management strategies is discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1093/jee/toad240,0
751,"Influence Of Competition And Intraguild Predation Between Two Candidate Biocontrol Parasitoids On Their Potential Impact Against Harrisia Cactus Mealybug, Hypogeococcus sp. (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae)","Abstract When two or more parasitoid species, particularly candidates for biocontrol, share the same target in the same temporal window, a complex of behaviors can occur among them. We studied the type of interactions (competition and intraguild predation) that existed between the nymphal parasitoids Anagyrus cachamai and A. lapachosus (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), two candidate neoclassical biocontrol agents against the Puerto Rican cactus pest mealybug, Hypogeococcus sp. (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae). The surrogate native congener host in Argentina, the cactus mealybug Hypogeococcus sp., was studied to predict which species should be released; in the case that both should be released, in which order, and their potential impact on host suppression. In the laboratory we conducted experiments where different densities of the host mealybug were exposed to naive females of A. cachamai and A. lapachosus sequentially in both directions. Experiments were analyzed by combining a series of competitive behavioral and functional response models. A fully Bayesian approach was used to select the best explaining models and calculate their parameters. Intraguild predation existed between A. cachamai , the species that had the greatest ability to exploit the resource, and A. lapachosus , the strongest species in the interference competition. The role that intraguild predation played in suppression of Hypogeococcus sp. indicated that a multiple release strategy for the two biocontrol agents would produce better control than a single release; as for the release order, A. lapachosus should be released first.",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-480439/v1,0
752,Symbiont-conferred immunity interacts with the effects of parasitoid genotype and intraguild predation to shape pea aphid immunity in a clone-specific fashion,"Abstract Host-parasite interactions represent complex co-evolving systems in which genetic variation within a species can significantly affect selective pressure on traits in the other (for example via inter-species indirect genetic effects). While often viewed as a two-species interaction between host and parasite species, some systems are more complex due to the involvement of symbionts in the host that influence its immunity, enemies of the host, and the parasite through intraguild predation. However, it remains unclear what the joint effects of intraguild predation, defensive endosymbiosis, within-species genetic variation and indirect genetic effects on host immunity are. We have addressed this question in an important agricultural pest system, the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum , which shows significant intraspecific variability in immunity to the parasitoid wasp Aphidius ervi due to immunity conferring endosymbiotic bacteria. In a complex experiment involving a quantitative genetic design of the parasitoid, two ecologically different aphid lineages and the aphid lion Chrysoperla carnea as an intraguild predator, we demonstrate that aphid immunity is affected by intraspecific genetic variation in the parasitoid and the aphid, as well as by associated differences in the defensive endosymbiont communities. Using 16s rRNA sequencing, we identified secondary symbionts that differed between the lineages. We further show that aphid lineages differ in their altruistic behaviour once parasitised whereby infested aphids move away from the clonal colony to facilitate predation. The outcome of these complex between-species interactions not only shape important host-parasite systems but have also implications for understanding the evolution of multitrophic interactions, and aphid biocontrol.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.01.442267,0

754,"Cannibalism and intraguild predation involved in the intra- and inter-specific interactions of the invasive fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and lepidopteran maize stemborers","Abstract Intra- and interspecific competitions play important role in determing spread and survival/death (cannibalism or intraguild predation) of organisms which share the same resource. However, the trends of relation between cannibalism and intraguild predation, and the costs and benefits of such behaviours are difficult to establish within insect communities and a little is known about how such behaviours are affected by invasive species. The present study was aimed at assessing the interactions between larvae of fall armyworm ( Spodoptera frugiperda ) and maize stemborers ( Busseola fusca , Sesamia calamistis and Chilo partellus ) in relation to cannibalism and intraguild predation when they are subjected to utilize the same resource. Experiments involving treatments with either single species of S. frugiperda or any of the stemborers or pairwise species combinations were conducted under laboratory conditions. The experimental insect larvae were reared on maize leaves and monitored until the last developmental stage where larval survival, mortality, and cannibalism and/or intraguild predation were recorded. Results of the intra-specific interaction indicated that S. frugiperda exhibited cannibalism to a larger degree than the stemborers species, especially at the late instars stages. The higher cannibalism trait in S. frugiperda turned however to competitive advantage as it led to a higher degree of intraguild predation when they cohabit with other stemborer species. Overall, interaction with S. frugiperda is thus detrimental for the stemborer species and may be an important factor to explain the invasive success of the pest. Such knowledge is essential in designing successful integrated pest management strategies.",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1306705/v1,0

756,The effects of intransitive competition on coexistence,"Abstract Coexistence theory has been developed with an almost exclusive focus on interactions between two species, often ignoring more complex and indirect interactions, such as intransitive loops, that can emerge in competition networks. In fact, intransitive competition has typically been studied in isolation from other pairwise stabilising processes, and thus little is known about how intransitivity interacts with more traditional drivers of species coexistence such as niche partitioning. To integrate intransitivity into traditional coexistence theory, we developed a metric of growth rate when rare, , to identify and quantify the impact of intransitive competition against a backdrop of pairwise stabilising niche differences. Using this index with simulations of community dynamics, we demonstrate that intransitive loops can both stabilise or destabilise species coexistence, but the strength and importance of intransitive interactions are significantly affected by the length and the topology of these loops. We conclude by showing how can be used to evaluate effects of intransitivity in empirical studies. Our results emphasise the need to integrate complex mechanisms emerging from diverse interactions into our understanding of species coexistence.",https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12775,0
757,Everything you always wanted to know about intransitive competition but were afraid to ask,"Abstract Over 40 years after the introduction of the concept into ecology, intransitive (i.e. non‐hierarchical) competition remains overlooked by ecological theory, despite theoretical work showing it could be a major driver of species coexistence. This special feature presents six studies, including models, reviews, experimental studies and large‐scale observational studies. Collectively, these studies help to (i) link intransitive competition with short‐ and long‐term coexistence and with other ecological patterns, (ii) evaluate the conditions under which intransitivity is more common and (iii) determine how best to quantify the degree of intransitivity. The studies in this special feature show the generality of intransitive competition in nature, explore interactions between intransitivity and other coexistence mechanisms, and illustrate the effect of environmental conditions (drought, shade, fertility) on intransitivity and coexistence. They also show which metrics best quantify intransitivity and highlight the importance of adopting a more continuous view of competition as varying from strongly transitive to strongly intransitive. The studies also examine relationships between intransitivity and functional diversity and explore the evolution of intransitivity over time. Synthesis . The studies presented here advance the field by integrating intransitive competition into species coexistence and general ecological theory. We also highlight important research gaps that will hopefully inspire the next generation of studies in this topic.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12972,0
758,"Intransitive competition is common across five major taxonomic groups and is driven by productivity, competitive rank and functional traits","Abstract Competition can be fully hierarchical or intransitive, and this degree of hierarchy is driven by multiple factors, including environmental conditions, the functional traits of the species involved or the topology of competition networks. Studies simultaneously analysing these drivers of competition hierarchy are rare. Additionally, organisms compete either directly or via interference competition for resources or space, within a local neighbourhood or across the habitat. Therefore, the drivers of competition could change accordingly and depend on the taxa studied. We performed the first multi‐taxon study on pairwise competition across major taxonomic groups, including experiments with vascular plants, mosses, saprobic fungi, aquatic protists and soil bacteria. We evaluated how general is competition intransitivity from the pairwise competition matrix including all species and also for each possible three‐species combination (triplets). We then examined which species were likely to engage in competitive loops and the effects of environmental conditions, competitive rank and functional traits on intransitive competition. We found some degree of competition intransitivity in all taxa studied, with 38% to 5% of triplets being intransitive. Variance in competitive rank between species and more fertile conditions strongly reduced intransitivity, with triplets composed of species differing widely in their competitive ranks much less likely to be intransitive. Including functional traits of the species involved more than doubled the variation explained compared to models including competitive rank only. Both trait means and variance within triplets affected the odds of them being intransitive. However, the traits responsible and the direction of trait effects varied widely between taxa, suggesting that traits can have a wide variety of effects on competition. Synthesis . We evaluated the drivers of competition across multiple taxa and showed that productivity and competitive rank are fundamental drivers of intransitivity. We also showed that not only the functional traits of each species, but also those of the accompanying species, determine competition intransitivity. Intransitive competition is common across multiple taxa but can dampen under fertile conditions or for those species with large variance in their competitive abilities. This provides a first step towards predicting the prevalence of intransitive competition in natural communities.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12959,0

760,Rock-Paper-Scissor Dynamics and Intransitive Competition link Ecology and Evolution,"Rock-paper-scissors (RPS) dynamics have been shown to affect the evolutionary relationships within populations. These processes are analogous to the ways in which intransitive competition modifies ecological outcomes and the co-existence between species within communities. Here we explore the similarities between rock-paper-scissor dynamics and intransitive competition and how this link opens new avenues of research into eco-evolutionary processes. Intransitivity can drive the stable coexistence of phenotypes within species, as well as the diversity of species within communities. In addition, the links between these dynamics highlight possible feedback mechanisms that might operate across these evolutionary and ecological scales. Using simulations, we show that greater intraspecific intransitivity within a population can lead greater levels of intransitivity at the community-level, with direct implications for community diversity and stability. As such, RPS dynamics and intransitivity can serve as an ideal conceptual framework to understand the feedback mechanisms that drive diversity across evolutionary and ecological scales.",https://doi.org/10.22541/au.166359782.20667033/v1,0
761,Habitat loss alters effects of intransitive higher-order competition on biodiversity: a new metapopulation framework,"Recent studies have suggested that intransitive competition, as opposed to hierarchical competition, allows more species to coexist. Furthermore, it is recognized that the prevalent paradigm, which assumes that species interactions are exclusively pairwise, may be insufficient. More importantly, whether and how habitat loss, a key driver of biodiversity loss, can alter these complex competition structures (and therefore species coexistence) remain unclear. We thus present a new, simple yet comprehensive metapopulation framework that can account for any competition pattern and more complex higher-order interactions (HOIs) among species. We find that competitive intransitivity increases community diversity and that HOIs generally enhance this effect. Essentially, intransitivity promotes species richness by preventing the dominance of a few species, unlike the hierarchical competition, while HOIs facilitate species coexistence through stabilizing community fluctuations. However, variation in species’ vital rates and habitat loss can weaken or even reverse such higher-order effects, as their interaction can lead to a more rapid decline in competitive intransitivity under HOIs. Thus, it is essential to correctly identify the most appropriate interaction model for a given system before models are used to inform conservation efforts. Overall, our simple model framework provides a more parsimonious explanation for biodiversity maintenance than the existing theory.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2020.1571,0
762,Structures of intransitive competition network affect functional attributes of plant community under nitrogen enrichment,"Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is a potential danger factor for grassland ecology, and will cause unpredictable consequences to plant communities. However, how plant species interactions response to N enrichment and then affect ecological functions are not fully known. We investigated how intransitive competition network was related to the functional attributes of plant community under a 13-years N-deposition experiment. Results showed that intransitive competition network was not a single structure, but a complexly interwoven structure of various simple structures. Nested work was more common, accounting for 76.96%, and gained new species at a higher colonization rate than short network did. The network had a long-term mechanism to maintain the small-scale Alpha diversity, and a significant lag effect on the large-scale Gamma diversity. Under the conditions of N ≥ 2 g N·m-2·year-1, without mowing and under high fertilization frequency, the increase of network complexity significantly decreased plot biomass gradually. The relationship between biomass and network complexity is quadratic curves, also between abundancy and the complexity, but with the opposite bending directions, which indicated that biomass and abundance were complementary to each other, which may be a mechanism of maintaining the relative balance of species competition. In addition, the decrease of species asynchronism changing with the increase of N-enrichment gradually destroyed ecosystem stability. However, at medium N enrichment, intransitive network counteracted the negative effects of N enrichment and maintained or even improved the biomass ecosystem stability. Our results suggested that intransitive competition network is an internal mechanism of self-restoration of a grassland ecosystem. Under nitrogen enrichment conditions, competitive networks complexity is reduced, leading to a reduction in species diversity. These analyses emphasize the important role of intransitive network structure to stabilize grassland ecosystem. In order to achieve sustainable development of grassland, it is indispensable to control nitrogen addition rate.",https://doi.org/10.22541/au.163913495.54051840/v1,0

This exceptional find provides for the first time direct evidence of a vertebrate three-level food chain in the fossil record with the simultaneous preservation of three trophic levels. Our analysis shows that small-sized Lower Permian xenacanthid sharks of the genus Triodus preyed on larval piscivorous amphibians. The recorded trophic interaction can be explained by the adaptation of certain xenacanthids to fully freshwater environments and the fact that in these same environments, large temnospondyls occupied the niche of modern crocodiles. This unique faunal association has not been documented after the Permian and Triassic. Therefore, this Palaeozoic three-level food chain provides strong and independent support for changes in aquatic trophic chain structures through time.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2007.1170,0
765,Predator Interference across Trophic Chains,"Conflict between ratio—dependent views of trophic interactions finds its simplest resolution in the comparison of steady—state responses of trophic chain to increases in primary productivity. We analyze data on trophic abundances of lake ecosystems with a general trophic—chain model that is intermediate between prey dependence and ratio dependence, and can describe either of the two extremes, depending on parameter values. We estimate, for all trophic levels, the set of interference coefficients that predicts the observed statistical relationship between biomasses of adjacent trophic levels. This constitutes a test of two competing theories, since the model we use is a prey—dependent model if all interference coefficients are °0, and a ratio—dependent model if they are °1. The results show that the observed relationships among trophic levels in lake ecosystems are compatible with a ratio—dependent parameterization of this model, with interference distributed relatively evenly across trophic chains, and are incompatible with a pure prey dependent parameterization. We suggest that approximate ratio dependence applied uniformly across trophic chains is a more plausible description of lake ecosystems than either pure prey dependence (non—interference) or ""concentrated interference"" (prey dependence at some trophic levels and partial interference in others).",https://doi.org/10.2307/1940937,0
766,Experimental evidence for a behavior-mediated trophic cascade in a terrestrial food chain,"Predators of herbivorous animals can affect plant populations by altering herbivore density, behavior, or both. To test whether the indirect effect of predators on plants arises from density or behavioral responses in a herbivore population, we experimentally examined the dynamics of terrestrial food chains comprised of old field plants, leaf-chewing grasshoppers, and spider predators in Northeast Connecticut. To separate the effects of predators on herbivore density from the effects on herbivore behavior, we created two classes of spiders: ( i ) risk spiders that had their feeding mouth parts glued to render them incapable of killing prey and ( ii ) predator spiders that remained unmanipulated. We found that the effect of predators on plants resulted from predator-induced changes in herbivore behavior (shifts in activity time and diet selection) rather than from predator-induced changes in grasshopper density. Neither predator nor risk spiders had a significant effect on grasshopper density relative to a control. This demonstrates that the behavioral response of prey to predators can have a strong impact on the dynamics of terrestrial food chains. The results make a compelling case to examine behavioral as well as density effects in theoretical and empirical research on food chain dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.20.10735,0

768,Microplastic Vector Effects: Are Fish at Risk When Exposed via the Trophic Chain?,"In aquatic organisms, trophic transfer is a relevant exposure route for microplastics (MPs). Despite their relevance, effect studies on fish exposed via trophic chains are currently very scarce. MPs are known to contain many chemicals that could be transferred to organisms and induce deleterious effects. However, there is currently no consensus on whether MPs represent a significant exposure pathway to chemicals in contaminated habitats. Here, we exposed three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to polyethylene MPs via prey ingestion, in a one-month experiment. MPs were either pristine or spiked with chlorpyrifos (CPF), and a CPF control was included to§ compare vector effects of MPs and natural prey. Following exposure, we assessed AChE activity and fish behavior (feeding, locomotion, environment exploration and reaction to the introduction of a novel object). No effect was observed in fish exposed to pristine MPs. CPF accumulation was observed in fish exposed to CPF-spiked MPs (MP-CPF), confirming the vector potential of MPs. However, CPF accumulation was more important in fish exposed to CPF via prey. In fish exposed to MP-CPF, we observed significant AChE inhibition and hyperactivity, which could result in increased vulnerability to predation. CPF organ distribution differed between groups, suggesting that chemical exposure via MPs could alter organ distribution of chemicals. This can result in a change in the organs most at risk, likely increasing intestine exposure.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2020.00090,0

Mean concentrations of Zn, Pb, Cd, Ni, and Cu in soil were 55, 52, 44, 23, and 10 % of the permitted values, respectively. The concentrations of potentially toxic trace elements in soil samples were higher compared to their levels in grass, except for Cd which was the other way around. Higher concentration of Cd in grass than in soil may be attributable to direct deposition of metal particulates emitted from motor vehicles on grass, rather than soil along the road. As far as other metals (Pb, Ni, Cu, Zn) are concerned, concentration in soil was higher than in grass, however, lower than in the fauna. In the investigated meadow, both grass cover and the collected soil fauna accumulated cadmium in largest amounts and incorporated the studied metals in the following order: Cd > Zn > Cu > Ni > Pb. All considered elements showed greater concentrations (nearly tenfold higher for cadmium) in fauna than grasses.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5595-4,0
770,[Trophic chains in soil].,"Trophic links of soil animals are extensively diverse but also flexible. Moreover, feeding activity of large soil saprotrophs often cascades into a range of ecosystem-level consequences via the ecological engineering. Better knowledge on the main sources of energy utilized by soil animals is needed for understanding functional structure of soil animal communities and their participation in the global carbon cycling. Using published and original data, we consider the relative importance of dead organic matter and saprotrophic microorganisms as a basal energy source in the detritus-based food chains, the feeding of endogeic macrofauna on the stabilized soil organic matter, and the role of recent photosynthate in the energy budget of soil communities. Soil food webs are spatially and functionally compartmentalized, though the separation of food chains into bacteria- and fungi-based channels seems to be an over-simplification. The regulation of the litter decomposition rates via top-down trophic interactions across more than one trophic level is only partly supported by experimental data, but mobile litter-dwelling predators play a crucial role in integrating local food webs within and across neighboring ecosystems.",,0
771,Toxicity of CeO<sub>2</sub>nanoparticles on a freshwater experimental trophic chain: A study in environmentally relevant conditions through the use of mesocosms,"The toxicity of CeO2 NPs on an experimental freshwater ecosystem was studied in mesocosm, with a focus being placed on the higher trophic level, i.e. the carnivorous amphibian species Pleurodeles waltl. The system comprised species at three trophic levels: (i) bacteria, fungi and diatoms, (ii) Chironomus riparius larvae as primary consumers and (iii) Pleurodeles larvae as secondary consumers. NP contamination consisted of repeated additions of CeO2 NPs over 4 weeks, to obtain a final concentration of 1 mg/L. NPs were found to settle and accumulate in the sediment. No effects were observed on litter decomposition or associated fungal biomass. Changes in bacterial communities were observed from the third week of NP contamination. Morphological changes in CeO2 NPs were observed at the end of the experiment. No toxicity was recorded in chironomids, despite substantial NP accumulation (265.8 ± 14.1 mg Ce/kg). Mortality (35.3 ± 6.8%) and a mean Ce concentration of 13.5 ± 3.9 mg/kg were reported for Pleurodeles. Parallel experiments were performed on Pleurodeles to determine toxicity pathways: no toxicity was observed by direct or dietary exposures, although Ce concentrations almost reached 100 mg/kg. In view of these results, various toxicity mechanisms are proposed and discussed. The toxicity observed on Pleurodeles in mesocosm may be indirect, due to microorganism's interaction with CeO2 NPs, or NP dissolution could have occurred in mesocosm due to the structural complexity of the biological environment, resulting in toxicity to Pleurodeles. This study strongly supports the importance of ecotoxicological assessment of NPs under environmentally relevant conditions, using complex biological systems.",https://doi.org/10.3109/17435390.2015.1053422,0
772,Trophic Interactions in Temperate Lake Ecosystems: A Test of Food Chain Theory,"In a comparative study covering 11 temperate lake ecosystems of Iow to intermediate productivity, we tested the predictions of the food chain model developed by L. Oksanen et al. The pelagic habitat of the most unproductive lakes lacked secondary carnivores (piscivores), whereas secondary carnivores inhabited the more productive lakes in agreement with the assumption that food chain length is limited by the productivity of the system. The observed relationships between planktivores (primary carnivores), zooplankton (herbivores), and phytoplankton (primary producers) were in agreement with the predictions of the Oksanen et al. model for three- and four-trophic-link systems. Piscivore relationships were significant only when the biomass of piscivorous perch only was used as the independent variable (piscivorous perch amounted to ≥97% of total piscivore biomass in five out of six four-link systems). The results suggest that gross patterns of food web dynamics in temperate lakes may be collapsed into food chain dynamics. However, as the higher trophic levels of most lakes were dominated by the same two species, an alternative hypothesis is that the simplicity of the food webs studied allowed food chain dynamics to approximate food web dynamics. The food chain model tested gave accurate predictions of trophic-level relationships within the rather narrow productivity range studied. However, previous data suggest that, due to size-structured interactions, secondary carnivores (piscivores) play a minor role in highly productive systems, a circumstance that may explain the postulated increase in mortality rate of zooplankton with increasing productivity. The observed increase in number of trophic levels with productivity does not necessarily imply a causal relationship between productivity and food chain length, as lake productivity is also correlated with structural complexity (in thc form of submerged vegetation and an oxygenated hypollmnion). Habitat heterogeneity may thus influence food chain length, and in general it is likely that food chain length will depend on more than one environmental variable.",https://doi.org/10.1086/285403,0
773,"Links in the trophic chain: modeling functional relationships between in situ oceanography, krill, and blue whale distribution under different oceanographic regimes","The response of marine predators to global climate change and shifting ocean conditions is tightly linked with their environment and prey. Environmental data are frequently used as proxies for prey availability in marine predator distribution models, as the ephemeral nature of prey makes sampling difficult. For this reason, the functional, ecological links between environment, prey, and predator are rarely described or explicitly tested. We used 3 years of vessel-based whale survey data paired with oceanographic sampling and hydroacoustic backscatter to model trophic relationships between water column structure, krill availability, and blue whale Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda distribution in New Zealand’s South Taranaki Bight region under typical (2014 and 2017) and warm (2016) austral summer oceanographic regimes. The warm regime was characterized by a shallower mixed layer, and a stronger, thicker, and warmer thermocline. Boosted regression tree models showed that krill metrics predicted blue whale distribution (typical regime = 36% versus warm regime = 64% cross-validated deviance explained) better than oceanography (typical regime = 19% versus warm regime = 31% cross-validated deviance explained). However, oceanographic features that predicted more krill aggregations (typical regime) and higher krill density (warm regime) aligned closely with the features that predicted higher probability of blue whale presence in each regime. Therefore, this study confirms that environmental drivers of prey availability can serve as suitable proxies for blue whale distribution. Considering changing ocean conditions that may influence the distribution of marine predators, these findings emphasize the need for models based on functional relationships, and calibrated across a broad range of conditions, to inform effective conservation management.",https://doi.org/10.3354/meps13339,0
774,Resistance of seagrass habitats to ocean acidification via altered interactions in a tri-trophic chain,"Despite the wide knowledge about prevalent effects of ocean acidification on single species, the consequences on species interactions that may promote or prevent habitat shifts are still poorly understood. Using natural CO2 vents, we investigated changes in a key tri-trophic chain embedded within all its natural complexity in seagrass systems. We found that seagrass habitats remain stable at vents despite the changes in their tri-trophic components. Under high pCO2, the feeding of a key herbivore (sea urchin) on a less palatable seagrass and its associated epiphytes decreased, whereas the feeding on higher-palatable green algae increased. We also observed a doubled density of a predatory wrasse under acidified conditions. Bottom-up CO2 effects interact with top-down control by predators to maintain the abundance of sea urchin populations under ambient and acidified conditions. The weakened urchin herbivory on a seagrass that was subjected to an intense fish herbivory at vents compensates the overall herbivory pressure on the habitat-forming seagrass. Overall plasticity of the studied system components may contribute to prevent habitat loss and to stabilize the system under acidified conditions. Thus, preserving the network of species interactions in seagrass ecosystems may help to minimize the impacts of ocean acidification in near-future oceans.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61753-1,0

The present project couples 2 models, a pelagic and a benthic one, to synthesise both these approaches to this ecosystem. This model shows that in spite of net carbon production being more than 10-fold lower than phytoplankton production benthic suspension feeders partly control the phytoplankton dynamics in the Bay. Computation of the nitrogen fluxes reveals the role of the benthic trophic chain in nutrient recycling. It is possible to show that an increase in nitrogen loading in the Bay would have limited consequences on the ecosystem, with the excess nitrogen being transferred to shelf waters without entering the trophic chain. The problem of toxic bloom events that can affect benthic suspension feeders, and consequently the total ecosystem, will have to be thoroughly studied.

776,Bioaccumulation and Trophic Magnification of Short- and Medium-Chain Chlorinated Paraffins in Food Webs from Lake Ontario and Lake Michigan,"Chlorinated paraffins (CPs) are complex mixtures of chlorinated alkanes used in a myriad of industrial applications as flame retardant plasticizers and additives. In this study, the distribution and bioaccumulation/biomagnification of short-chain CPs (C10-C13, SCCPs) and medium-chain CPs (C14-C17, MCCPs) were investigated in samples collected between 1999 and 2004 from Lake Ontario and northern Lake Michigan. Total (sigma) SCCPs and sigmaMCCPs concentrations in water from Lake Ontario were 1190 pg/L and 0.9 pg/L (data from 2004 only), respectively. CPs were also detected in invertebrates and fish from both lakes. SCCP predominated in organisms from Lake Michigan with the highest mean concentrations found in lake trout [Salvelinus namaycush, 123 +/- 35 ng/g wet weight (ww)]. In Lake Ontario, MCCPs predominated in most species with the highest levels detected in slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus, 108 ng/g ww) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax, 109 ng/g ww). Bioaccumulation and biomagnification of CPs was evaluated on an isomer basis (i.e., C10H17Cl5, C10H16Cl6, etc). Log bioaccumulation factors for lake trout (lipid based) ranged from 4.1 to 7.0 for SCCPs and 6.3 to 6.8 for MCCPs. SCCPs and MCCPs were found to biomagnify between prey and predators from both lakes with highest values observed for Diporeia-sculpin (Lake Ontario, C15Cl9 = 43; Lake Michigan, C10Cl5 = 26). Trophic magnification factors for the invertebrates-forage fish-lake trout food webs ranged from 0.41 to 2.4 for SCCPs and from 0.06 to 0.36 for MCCPs. Given the prominence of CPs, particularly in lake waters and in lower food web organisms, further investigation is needed to evaluate the magnitude of their distribution and accumulation/magnification in the Great Lakes environment.",https://doi.org/10.1021/es703184s,0
777,"Light, nutrients, and food-chain length constrain planktonic energy transfer efficiency across multiple trophic levels","The efficiency of energy transfer through food chains [food chain efficiency (FCE)] is an important ecosystem function. It has been hypothesized that FCE across multiple trophic levels is constrained by the efficiency at which herbivores use plant energy, which depends on plant nutritional quality. Furthermore, the number of trophic levels may also constrain FCE, because herbivores are less efficient in using plant production when they are constrained by carnivores. These hypotheses have not been tested experimentally in food chains with 3 or more trophic levels. In a field experiment manipulating light, nutrients, and food-chain length, we show that FCE is constrained by algal food quality and food-chain length. FCE across 3 trophic levels (phytoplankton to carnivorous fish) was highest under low light and high nutrients, where algal quality was best as indicated by taxonomic composition and nutrient stoichiometry. In 3-level systems, FCE was constrained by the efficiency at which both herbivores and carnivores converted food into production; a strong nutrient effect on carnivore efficiency suggests a carryover effect of algal quality across 3 trophic levels. Energy transfer efficiency from algae to herbivores was also higher in 2-level systems (without carnivores) than in 3-level systems. Our results support the hypothesis that FCE is strongly constrained by light, nutrients, and food-chain length and suggest that carryover effects across multiple trophic levels are important. Because many environmental perturbations affect light, nutrients, and food-chain length, and many ecological services are mediated by FCE, it will be important to apply these findings to various ecosystem types.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0805566105,0
778,Trophic Transfer of Au Nanoparticles from Soil along a Simulated Terrestrial Food Chain.,"To determine if nanoparticles (NPs) could be transferred from soil media to invertebrates and then to secondary consumers, we examined the trophic transfer of Au NPs along a simulated terrestrial food chain. Earthworms (Eisenia fetida) were exposed to Au NPs in artificial soil media and fed to juvenile bullfrogs (Rana catesbeina). Earthworm Au concentrations were continuously monitored so that the cumulative dose to bullfrogs could be accurately estimated throughout the experiment. We exposed a second group of bullfrogs to equivalent doses of Au NPs by oral gavage to compare the bioavailability of NPs through direct exposure to trophic exposure. We observed accumulation of Au in liver, kidney, spleen, muscle, stomach, and intestine in both treatment groups. Tissue concentrations decreased on average of approximately 100-fold with each trophic-step. The total assimilated dose averaged only 0.09% of the administered dose for direct exposure (oral gavage), but 0.12% for the trophic exposure. The results suggest that manufactured NPs present in soil may be taken up into food chains and transferred to higher order consumers. They also suggest that Au NPs may be more bioavailable through trophic exposure than direct exposure and that trophic transfer may influence the biodistribution of particles once absorbed.",https://doi.org/10.1021/es3025325,0
779,Abiotic Controls of Trophic Cascades in a Simple Grassland Food Chain,"I experimentally examined the relative importance of a top predator in a three trophic level food chain in which the abiotic conditions were varied. Food chains consisting of plants, grasshoppers and wolf spiders were established in field cages placed over natural prairie. Grasshopper resource intake was manipulated by altering the abiotic environment (i.e., shading during peak grasshopper feeding times to reduce temperature and radiation), and thus the time they had available for feeding. Grasshoppers in control (unshaded) food chains compensated for spider predation by increased per capita survival and food consumption by those remaining. In this scenario, plant biomass was unaffected by the presence of spiders (i.e., no trophic cascade). However, when the grasshoppers were shaded for the morning hours, reducing their time available for feeding, spiders reduced grasshopper density, and the abundance of plants increased relative to when spiders were absent (i.e., a trophic cascade). This experiment showed that by simply altering the abiotic environment such that grasshopper foraging ability changed, profound differences in the impacts of top predators resulted.",https://doi.org/10.2307/3545939,0
780,Particle-Size Dependent Accumulation and Trophic Transfer of Cerium Oxide through a Terrestrial Food Chain,"The accumulation and trophic transfer of nanoparticle (NP) or bulk CeO2 through a terrestrial food chain was evaluated. Zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.) was planted in soil with 0 or 1228 μg/g bulk or NP CeO2. After 28 d, zucchini tissue Ce content was determined by ICP-MS. Leaf tissue from each treatment was used to feed crickets (Acheta domesticus). After 14 d, crickets were analyzed for Ce content or were fed to wolf spiders (family Lycosidae). NP CeO2 significantly suppressed flower mass relative to control and bulk treatments. The Ce content of zucchini was significantly greater when exposure was in the NP form. The flowers, leaves, stems, and roots of zucchini exposed to bulk CeO2 contained 93.3, 707, 331, and 119,000 ng/g, respectively; NP-exposed plants contained 153, 1510, 479, and 567 000 ng/g, respectively. Crickets fed NP CeO2-exposed zucchini leaves contained significantly more Ce (33.6 ng/g) than did control or bulk-exposed insects (15.0-15.2 ng/g). Feces from control, bulk, and NP-exposed crickets contained Ce at 248, 393, and 1010 ng/g, respectively. Spiders that consumed crickets from control or bulk treatments contained nonquantifiable Ce; NP-exposed spiders contained Ce at 5.49 ng/g. These findings show that NP CeO2 accumulates in zucchini at greater levels than equivalent bulk materials and that this greater NP intake results in trophic transfer and possible food chain contamination.",https://doi.org/10.1021/es503792f,0
781,"Bioaccumulation and Trophic Transfer of Short Chain Chlorinated Paraffins in a Marine Food Web from Liaodong Bay, North China","Short chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) are under the evaluation for inclusion into the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants. However, information on their bioconcentration and biomagnification in marine ecosystems is unavailable, limiting the evaluation of their ecological risks. In this study, seawater, sediment, zooplankton, invertebrates, and fishes collected from Liaodong Bay, Bohai Sea, North China were analyzed to investigate the residual level, congener group profile, bioaccumulation, and trophic transfer of SCCPs in a marine food web. The total concentrations of SCCPs ranged from 4.1 to 13.1 ng L(-1) in seawater, 65 to 541 ng g(-1) (dw) in sediment, and 86 to 4400 ng g(-1) (ww) in organisms. Correspondence analysis indicated the relative enrichment of C10Cl5 and C11Cl5 formula groups in most aquatic organisms. Both the logarithm bioaccumulation factors (log BAFs: 4.1-6.7) and biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs: 0.1-7.3) of individual congeners implied the bioaccumulation of SCCPs. The trophic magnification factor (TMF) of ∑SCCPs was determined to be 2.38 in the zooplankton-shrimp-fish food web, indicating biomagnification potential of SCCPs in the marine ecosystem.

Email: nfisher@notes.cc.sunysb.edu ABSTRACT: There is increasing recognition of the importance of dietary pathways in determining metal body burdens in marine organisms. With a simple kinetic model that requires information about the ingestion rate of an animal and the assimilation efficiency (AE) and efflux rate constant (ke) of a metal following dietary exposure, it is possible to quantitatively predict the trophic transfer and biomagnification potential of a metal between trophic levels. In this study, we used radiotracers to examine the trophic transfer of 7 metals (Am, Cd, Co, Cs, Mn, Se, and Zn) in a 4-step marine food chain from phytoplankton (Isochrysis galbana) to crustacean zooplankton (Artemia salina) to juvenile sea bream (Sparus auratus) and finally to piscivorous sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). AEs generally were highest for Cs (63–84%) and Se (60–77%), and lowest for Am (<10%) for all animals; differences in AEs for the other metals were comparatively small for all animals. There was no consistent pattern among the metal kes; however, kes for any given metal tended to decrease with increasing trophic level. At each trophic step, we calculated the trophic transfer factor (TTF), defined mathematically as the ratio of metal concentration in predatory animals to metal concentration in prey organisms at steady state, and found that this ratio consistently approached or exceeded 1 for only Cs, suggesting that Cs biomagnifies at every trophic step from phytoplankton to fish. TTF values were always <1 for Am, Cd, Mn, and Co, suggesting that these metals are not expected to biomagnify in marine food chains. Se and Zn did not consistently display TTF values >1 at every trophic level, but values were close enough to unity to suggest the possibility of biomagnification under certain environmental regimes.

783,MOVEMENT OF CADMIUM AND LEAD IN ANTHROPOGENICALLY FORMED TROPHIC CHAINS OF A PASTURE TYPE,"ABSTRACT: An investigation on the movement of Lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) in a trophic chain in 2 villages (industrial_x000D_

The contents of the 2 heavy metals in the soil, food and in different organs of young kids, so as their transfer in the 3 trophic levels (using different static and dynamic methods of recalculation) have been established. The authors show, that it is expedient to determine quantitatively the chemical heterogeneity at the heterotrophic levels applying two criteria: along with the dynamic criterion “Clarc of concentration”(Cc), used up to know, to include also “Factor of bioaccumulation” (FB), which shows the real value of accumulation or dispersal of the chemical element according to its content in soil or at the trophic level of the autotrophic organisms. The increased Cc of lead /4,72/ and cadmium /49,14/ in soil is not the reason for the concentration in the nutrition chain at the level of the autotrophic organisms and at the level of the organisms phytophages /kids/. The studies of the FB show that the technogenically high Clarc of lead and cadmium in the ecotope is the reason for some changes in the metabolism, enabling the dispersal of lead along the trophic chain, the_x000D_

784,Distribution and Trophic Transfer of Short-Chain Chlorinated Paraffins in an Aquatic Ecosystem Receiving Effluents from a Sewage Treatment Plant,"Short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) are an extremely complex group of industrial chemicals and found to be potential persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and thus have attracted extensive concern worldwide. In this study, influent, effluent, and sludge were collected from a large sewage treatment plant (STP) in Beijing, China. Water, sediment, and aquatic species were also collected from a recipient lake that receives effluents discharged from the STP. These samples were then analyzed to investigate the effect of STP effluent on distribution and trophic transfer of SCCPs in the local aquatic ecosystem. Concentrations of total SCCPs (ΣSCCPs) in lake water and surface sediments were found in the range 162–176 ng/L and 1.1–8.7 μg/g (dry weight, dw), respectively. Vertical concentration profiles of sediment cores showed ΣSCCPs decreased exponentially with increasing depth. Specific congener composition analysis in sediment layers indicated possible in situ biodegradation might be occurring. High bioaccumulation of SCCPs was observed in the sampled aquatic species. The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) generally increased with the number of chlorines in the SCCP congeners. A significantly positive correlation between lipid-normalized ΣSCCPs concentration and trophic levels (R2 = 0.65, p < 0.05) indicate that SCCPs can biomagnify through the food chain in the effluent-receiving aquatic ecosystem.",https://doi.org/10.1021/es200895b,0
785,Trophic Transfer of Antibiotic Resistance Genes in a Soil Detritus Food Chain,"The presence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are causing substantial global public concern; however, the dispersal of ARGs in the food chain is poorly understood. Here, we experimented with a soil collembolan ( Folsomia candida)-predatory mite ( Hypoaspis aculeifer) model food chain to study trophic transfer of ARGs in a manure-contaminated soil ecosystem. Our results showed that manure amendment of soil could significantly increase ARGs in the soil collembolan microbiome. With the ARGs in the prey collembolan microbiome increasing, an increase in ARGs in the predatory mite microbiome was also observed, especially for three high abundant ARGs ( blaSHV, fosX and aph6ia). Three unique ARGs were transferred into the microbiome of the predatory mite from manure amended soil via the prey collembolan ( aac(6' )-lb(akaaacA4), yidY_mdtL and tolC). Manure amendment altered the composition and structure and reduced the diversity of the microbiomes of the prey collembolan and the predatory mite. We further reveal that bacterial communities and mobile genetic elements were two important drivers for the trophic transfer of ARGs, not just for ARGs distribution in the samples. These findings suggest that the importance of food chain transmission of ARGs for the dispersal of resistance genes in soil ecosystems may be underestimated.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b00214,0
786,The return of the trophic chain: Fundamental vs. realized interactions in a simple arthropod food web,"Abstract The mathematical theory describing small assemblages of interacting species (community modules or motifs) has significantly improved our understanding of the emergent properties of ecological communities. It is not clear whether all interactions accounted for in such models will be realized in real communities. Here, we use community modules to experimentally explore whether the number of trophic links among species scales with community complexity (i.e. by adding species known to feed on each other from pairwise trials) in a simple mite community present in avocado orchards ( Persea americana ). By varying the presence of each of two predators ( Euseius stipulatus and Neoseiulus californicus ), one herbivore as shared prey ( Oligonychus perseae ) and pollen of Carpobrotus edulis as an alternative food resource, we mimicked communities with simple trophic chains, intraguild predation and/or apparent competition. We then assessed predation rates and the conversion of food into offspring in those communities. We found that increasing the number of potential interactions did not result in more complex realized community modules. Instead, all species effectively fed upon a single food item, hence all community modules actually corresponded to one or two linear trophic chains. Therefore, trophic links assumed to occur when species are assembled in pairs do not necessarily occur when other components of the community are present. Consequently, food web structure may be much less complex than predicted by theory.

As a sorbent we used zeolite of Sokirnitsa deposit (village Sokirnitsa, Khust district Transcarpathian region) of fraction 1.0 – 4.0 mm. Investigations were made at the Lviv research station of Institute of fisheries NAAS (Lviv oblast, Horodok region, Velykyi Lyubin). The sorption properties of natural Transcarpathian clinoptilolite towards Lead and Cadmium at dynamic conditions have been studied. The paper represents research results aimed at estimating effectiveness of removing of Lead and Cadmium ions from hydroecosystems using natural mineral–zeolite. The dynamics of heavy metals content at phytoplankton and muscular tissue of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix Valenciennes, 1844) was studied. Measurements were perfomed in pond № 24 (12) area 0.14 hectares which is fed by waters of the river Vereshchytsia. The pond depth is 1 – 1.5 meters. Results of investigations worked out statistically combining the groups. Considerable lowering of ions content of both metals in water was determined. The lowering of cadmium content in muscular tissue of Silver carp was much noticeable than the content of Lead. Results of such investigations are rather actual and perspective and will help to reduce the content of some toxicants in water medium. Improvement of water ecosystems after use of natural sorbents will guarantee ecologically safe products of fish culture and will increase the efficiency of the branch.",https://doi.org/10.15421/nvlvet6714,0
788,"Evaluating the trophic transfer of cadmium, polonium, and methylmercury in an estuarine food chain","Abstract We examined the transfer of Cd, methylmercury (MeHg), and Po in an estuarine food chain (from phytoplankton to zooplankton [ Daphnia pulex ] to killifish [ Fundulus heteroclitus ] and, finally, to juvenile striped bass [ Morone saxatilis ]) to better understand both the extent to which these elements may biomagnify and the underlying mechanisms governing this biomagnification. Among the phytoplankton examined ( Cyclotella meneghiniana and Chlamdomonas reinhardtii ), metal uptake was rapid, and volume concentration factors for all metals reached values between 10 4 and 10 5. The resulting assimilation efficiencies (AEs) of ingested metals in all animals were highest for MeHg, with values greater than 76%. The AEs of Cd were 21 to 33% in D. pulex , 1 to 16% in F. heteroclitus , and 38 to 56% in M. saxatilis. Polonium AEs were 69 to 87% in D. pulex , 25 to 41% in F. heteroclitus , and 9 to 21% in M. saxatilis. Loss rate constants ( k e ) of metals in D. pulex ranged from 0.04/d for MeHg to 0.39/d for Po; metal k e values for F. heteroclitus ranged from 0.01 to 0.02/d. Using a kinetic model, we showed that the trophic transfer factor, defined as the ratio of metal concentration in predatory animals to metal concentration in prey organisms, was greater than unity for all three metals in D. pulex feeding on phytoplankton, suggesting that these metals may be biomagnified at this trophic step. In killifish feeding on D. pulex , the trophic transfer factor was consistently greater than one for MeHg, consistently less than one for Cd, and from 0.1 to 1.4 for Po, suggesting that both MeHg and Po have the potential to biomagnify at this trophic step.",https://doi.org/10.1897/07-318.1,0
789,Trophic interactions in open systems: Effects of predators and nutrients on stream food chains,"Theory and empirical work on food chains has focused primarily on closed, equilibrial environments. We tested the combined effects of secondary consumers (fish) and limiting nutrients (nitrogen) on intermediate trophic levels in an open stream environment, where flow redistributes organisms and materials among patches of streambed habitat. Fish reduced the biomass of the dominant herbivore (baetid mayflies) within habitat patches both by direct predation and by causing increased emigration from the patches. The resulting decrease in herbivory caused an increase in the growth and biomass of primary producers (algae) in areas containing fish. Independent of the effect of fish, algal growth and biomass was increased by augmenting the nutrient supply to patches. Nutrient‐enriched areas (with high algal biomass) also supported greater populations of herbivores because they either grew faster in these areas or emigrated less frequently from them. Controlling influences on trophic structure came from both the top and the bottom of the food chain, and these influences were not conditional upon one another. Trophic structure in this system was determined by a mix of behavioral and trophic interactions between the major taxa, most of which were specific to open systems and not predicted by conventional theory.",https://doi.org/10.4319/lo.1999.44.5.1187,0
790,"[Predators, resources, and trophic chains in the regulation of plankton population and biomass in oligothrophic lakes].","The relative strength of ""top-down"" versus ""bottom-up"" control of plankton community structure and biomass in two small oligotrophic lakes (with and without fish), located near the Polar circle (Russia), has been investigated for two years, 1996 and 1997. The comparative analyses of zooplankton biomass and species abundance showed strong negative effect of fish, stickeback (Pungitius pungitius L.), on the zooplankton community species, size structure and biomass of particular prey species but no effect on the biomass of the whole trophic level. An intensive predation in Verkhneye lake has lead to: 1) sixfold decline in biomass of large cladoceran Holopedium gibberum comparing to the lake lacking predator, 2) shift in the size mode in zooplankton community and the replacement of the typical large grazers by small species--Bosmina longirostris and rotifers. Their abundance and biomass even increased, demonstrating the stimulating effect of fish on the ""inefficient"" and unprofitable prey organisms. The analysis of contributions of different factors into the cladoceran's birth rate changes was applied to demonstrate the relative impact of predators and resources on zooplankton abundance. An occasional introduction of the stickleback to Vodoprovodnoye lake (the reference lake in 1996) in summer 1997 lead to drastic canges in this ecosystem: devastating decrease of zooplankton biomass and complete elimination of five previously dominant grazer species. The abundance of edible phytoplankton was slightly higher in the lake with fish in 1996 and considerably higher in the lake where fish has appeared in 1997 showing the prevailing ""top-down"" control of phytoplankton in oligotrophic ecosystem. The reasons of trophic cascade appearance in oligotrophic lakes are also discussed.",,0

While trophic cascades can be particularly strong on rocky reefs, the majority of studies are restricted to sea urchin herbivores despite the presence of numerous other grazers. The present study examines the potential for predation by small fishes on New Zealand rocky reefs to suppress small invertebrate grazers (epifauna) living on brown seaweeds, with cascading effects on host seaweeds and their epiphytic algae. A trophic cascade was identified in experiments run in outdoor mesocosms. When epifaunal densities were reduced either artificially or by fish predation, seaweeds were more fouled, but less damaged, than where epifaunal populations flourished. These experimental findings were not fully consistent with patterns observed at field sites with varying fish densities. Variation in epifaunal taxonomic structure and seaweed palatability potentially dampened the cascading effect of fish predation on epifauna. Trophic cascades with non-urchin herbivores warrant further study, with a combination of laboratory and field work necessary to understand systems in which herbivores are difficult to manipulate.

792,"Mercury Content in the Trophic Chain of the Tanew River, Poland, Ecosystem","Mercury (Hg) is a highly toxic metal posing a hazard to water ecosystems. This investigation was aimed at determining Hg content in the Tanew River, Poland, and subsequent transfer to fish inhabiting this lake. The area studied included approximately a 50-km distance of the river, with 5 sampling locations selected. Samples of water and bottom sediments were collected from 10 sites along the river-bank zone for each location. At the same location, fish were caught and samples of coastal water plants were collected. Fish that were caught included the following species: chub (Leuciscus cephalus), pike (Esox lucius), ide (Leuciscus idus), and roach (Rutilus rutilus). Dominanting species of water plants included reed-mace (Typha angustifolia), rigid hornwort (Ceratophyllum demersum), and water knotweed (Polygonum amphibium). Mercury content in samples of water, bottom sediments, water plants, and fish tissues (muscles and gills) were determined by using a Mercury/MA-2000 system (NIC, Japan). The average Hg content in the waters of Tanew ranged between 1 and 5 microg/L, and in the bottom sediments ranged between 17 and 214 microg/kg dry weight, which are characteristic values for typical unpolluted areas. The highest Hg contamination of waters and bottom sediments was found where the Tanew estuary enters the San River. Mercury levels in fish from the Tanew delta appeared to be higher compared to other sampling sites. Data indicated that even if water environment is contaminated with Hg to a limited extent, fish accumulate this metal at higher levels, probably due to a bioaccumulation or bioconcentration factor.",https://doi.org/10.1080/15287394.2010.491774,0
793,Trophic Magnification of Short-Chain Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in a Terrestrial Food Chain from the Tibetan Plateau,"While there is a lack of information about the trophic transfer of short-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in the terrestrial ecosystem, this study focused on the occurrence and trophic transfer of both legacy and short-chain PFASs in a terrestrial food chain composed of the plants, plateau pikas, and eagles of the Tibetan Plateau. Total PFAS concentrations were in the range of 0.130–1.507, 0.406–1.085, 0.601–8.293, and 5.021–76.482 ng/g dw in soils, plants, pika muscles, and eagle muscles, respectively, among which perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) were predominant in all sample types. Levels of PFASs in eagle feathers were significantly correlated with those in eagle muscles (r = 0.73), implying feathers could be used as an indicator of exposure of raptors to PFASs. Trophic magnification factors of PFOS (5.75), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (2.43), C10–C12 perfluorocarboxylic acids (1.84–4.65), PFBA (5.11), and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (5.96) along the plant–pika–eagle food chain were all significantly greater than 1. The short-chain PFASs may be biomagnified in air-breathing animals because of the nonvolatility of their charged forms and recalcitrance (not biotransformed). The results suggest that the ecological risks of these short-chain substitutions warrant further investigation.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.1c01009,0
794,"Extreme events, trophic chain reactions, and shifts in phenotypic selection","Demographic consequences of rapid environmental change and extreme climatic events (ECEs) can cascade across trophic levels with evolutionary implications that have rarely been explored. Here, we show how an ECE in high Arctic Svalbard triggered a trophic chain reaction, directly or indirectly affecting the demography of both overwintering and migratory vertebrates, ultimately inducing a shift in density-dependent phenotypic selection in migratory geese. A record-breaking rain-on-snow event and ice-locked pastures led to reindeer mass starvation and a population crash, followed by a period of low mortality and population recovery. This caused lagged, long-lasting reductions in reindeer carrion numbers and resultant low abundances of Arctic foxes, a scavenger on reindeer and predator of migratory birds. The associated decrease in Arctic fox predation of goose offspring allowed for a rapid increase in barnacle goose densities. As expected according to r- and K-selection theory, the goose body condition (affecting reproduction and post-fledging survival) maximising Malthusian fitness increased with this shift in population density. Thus, the winter ECE acting on reindeer and their scavenger, the Arctic fox, indirectly selected for higher body condition in migratory geese. This high Arctic study provides rare empirical evidence of links between ECEs, community dynamics and evolution, with implications for our understanding of indirect eco-evolutionary impacts of global change.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-41940-6,0
795,Water quality implications from three decades of phosphorus loads and trophic dynamics in the Yahara chain of lakes,"Trophic responses to phosphorus (P) loads spanning 29–33 years were assessed for the eutrophic Yahara chain of lakes: Mendota (area = 39.6 km2, mean depth = 12.7 m, flushing rate = 0.23 yr-1); Monona (13.7 km2, 8.3 m, 1.3 yr-1); Waubesa (8.5 km2, 4.7 m, 4.3 yr-1); and Kegonsa (13.0 km2, 5.1 m, 3.0 yr-1). During extended drought periods with low P loads, summer (Jul–Aug) total P (TP) concentrations declined substantially in all 4 lakes, with Mendota achieving mesotrophic conditions (<0.024 mg L-1). In years when P loads were high due to major runoff events, summer TP in the lakes was high (especially in shallower Waubesa and Kegonsa); in some summers dissolved inorganic P was elevated, indicating algae growth was not P limited. Summer TP returned to normal levels following both low and high load years, signifying the lakes were responsive to P load changes. The proportion of P input loads passed via a lake's outlet to the next lake downstream increased as flushing rates increased. Because Monona, Waubesa, and Kegonsa received 60, 83, and 76% of their surface water P load from the respective upstream lake's outlet, reducing P loads in Mendota's large watershed was predicted to produce significant water quality benefits downstream. Modeling indicated a significant grazing effect of Daphnia on summer TP and Secchi transparency readings for Mendota and Monona. Finally, using drought loads as targets, our study established P loading reductions needed to improve water quality in all 4 Yahara lakes.",https://doi.org/10.5268/iw-4.1.680,0
796,Bioaccumulation of organochlorine pesticides in the trophic chain alga-freshwater fish,"The study was carried out on the alga Chlorella vulgaris and young specimens of crucian carp Carassius carassius. The algae and fish were exposed to a pesticide gamametox powder containing 0.6% of lindane and 3% of methoxychlor. Gas chromatography method was used to determine the content of these two active substances in the material. Based on the mean lindane and methoxychlor contents it was revealed that they were bioaccumulated at different levels of the trophic chain. Their accumulation was higher in fish than in algae, which were the source of their food. Their concentration in the muscles of crucian carp was higher when absorbed from food (i.e. Chlorella vulgaris cells), than directly from water. A similar situation was observed in relation to lindane content in the liver. In the brain, however, the concentration of both pesticides was diversioned or similar. The highest concentrations were revealed in the brain of crucian carp, slightly lower in the liver and the lowest in the muscles, i.e. edible parts of fish, irrespective of the way of absorption.",https://doi.org/10.3750/aip2002.32.1.04,0
797,Habitat area and edges affect the length of trophic chains in a fragmented forest,"The food chain length represents how much energy reaches different trophic levels in food webs. Environmental changes derived from human activities have the potential to affect chain length. We explore how habitat area and edges affect chain length through: (1) a bottom-up effect of abundance ('pyramid hypothesis'); (2) the truncation of the highest trophic level ('trophic-rank hypothesis'); and (3) changes in species connectivity patterns ('connectivity hypothesis'). We built plant-leaf miner-parasitoid food webs in 19 remnants of a fragmented Chaco forest from central Argentina. On each remnant, we constructed food webs from different locations at the forest interior and edges. For each food web, we registered the abundance of species, the species richness of each trophic level, estimated the connectivity of their networks, and the average food chain length. We used structural equation models to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of habitat area and edge/interior location on food chain length mediated by species richness, abundance and connectivity. We found no direct effects of habitat area on chain length but chains were longer at forest edges than at their interior. The three mechanisms were supported by our results, although they showed different strengths. First, we found that the interior favours a bottom-up abundance effect from herbivores to parasitoids that positively affected chain length; second, we found that the forest area positively affects plant richness, which has a strong effect on the number of resources used by consumers, with a positive effect on chain length. Third, the remnant area and interior position favoured plant richness with a negative effect on the abundance of parasitoids, which had a positive effect on chain length. In general, the strongest effects on chain length were detected through changes in abundance rather than species richness although abundance was less affected by habitat fragmentation. We evaluated for the first time the effects of human-driven habitat fragmentation on the length of trophic chains in highly diverse plant-herbivore-parasitoid networks. Despite the loss of species, small habitat fragments and edges embedded in the agricultural matrix can support interaction networks, making them conservation targets in managed landscapes.El largo de cadenas tróficas representa cuanta energía alcanza diferentes niveles tróficos en redes tróficas. Los cambios ambientales producto de las actividades humanas tienen el potencial de afectar el largo de las cadenas tróficas. Exploramos como el área de hábitat y los bordes afectan el largo de cadenas tróficas a través de: (1) un efecto ascendente de la abundancia (‘hipótesis pirámide’); (2) el truncamiento del nivel trófico superior (‘hipótesis de ranking trófico’); y (3) cambios en los patrones de conectividad (‘hipótesis de conectividad’). Construimos redes tróficas entre plantas-minadores de hoja-parasitoides en 19 remanentes de bosque Chaqueño serrano altamente fragmentado en el centro de Argentina. Para cada remanente construimos redes tróficas en distintas ubicaciones en el borde e interior del bosque. Para cada red trófica registramos la abundancia media de las especies, la riqueza de cada nivel trófico, estimamos la conectividad de las redes y el largo de cadenas tróficas promedio. Utilizamos modelos de ecuaciones estructurales para evaluar los efectos directos e indirectos del área y la ubicación borde/interior sobre el largo de cadenas tróficas mediado por la riqueza de especies, la abundancia y la conectividad. No encontramos efectos directos del área de hábitat sobre el largo de cadenas, pero las cadenas fueron más largas en los bordes que en el interior. Los tres mecanismos propuestos fueron apoyados por los resultados, pero mostraron distinta fuerza. Primero, encontramos que el interior de los bosques favorece los efectos ascendentes de la abundancia desde los herbívoros a los parasitoides lo que afectó positivamente al largo de las cadenas; segundo, encontramos que el área de bosque afectó positivamente a la riqueza de especies, lo que tuvo un efecto positivo en el largo de cadenas. Tercero, el área de bosque remanente y la ubicación en el interior favorecieron la riqueza de plantas, influyendo negativamente en la abundancia de parasitoides lo que tuvo un efecto positivo en el largo de cadenas. En general, los efectos más fuertes sobre el largo de cadenas se detectaron a través de cambios en la abundancia más que en la riqueza, aunque la abundancia fue menos afectada por la fragmentación del hábitat que la riqueza de especies. En este estudio evaluamos por primera vez los efectos de la fragmentación del hábitat por causas humanas sobre el largo de cadenas tróficas en redes tróficas altamente diversas de plantas, herbívoros y parasitoides. A pesar de la pérdida de especies, los fragmentos pequeños y los bordes de bosque inmersos en una matriz agrícola pueden sostener redes de interacciones, convirtiéndolos en objetivos de conservación en paisajes manejados.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13998,0
798,Trophic Transfer and Transformation of CeO<sub>2</sub> Nanoparticles along a Terrestrial Food Chain: Influence of Exposure Routes,"The trophic transfer and transformation of CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) through a simulated terrestrial food chain were investigated using a radiotracer technique and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). Radioactive 141CeO2 NPs were applied to head lettuce (Lactuca sativa), treated via root exposure in its potting soil (5.5 or 11 mg/plant) for 30 days or foliar exposure (7.2 mg/plant, with half of the leaves treated and the other half not) for 7 days. Subsequently, two groups of land snails (Achatina fulica) were exposed to 141Ce via either a direct (i.e., feeding on the lettuce leaves with 141Ce-contaminated surfaces) or an indirect/trophic (i.e., feeding on the lettuce leaves with systemically distributed 141Ce) route. To evaluate the influence of exposure routes, the Ce contents of the lettuce, snail tissues, and feces were determined by radioactivity measurements. The results show that both assimilation efficiencies (AEs) and food ingestion rates of Ce are greater for the trophic (indirect) exposure. The low AEs indicate that the CeO2 NPs ingested by snails were mostly excreted subsequently, and those that remained in the body were mainly concentrated in the digestive gland. XANES analysis shows that >85% of Ce was reduced to Ce(III) in the digestive gland under direct exposure, whereas Ce in the rest of the food chain (including feces) was largely in its original oxidized (IV) state. This study suggests that CeO2 NPs present in the environment may be taken up by producers and transferred to consumers along food chains and trophic transfer may affect food safety.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b00596,0
799,The interacting effects of temperature and food chain length on trophic abundance and ecosystem function,"1. While much is known about the independent effects of trophic structure and temperature on density and ecosystem processes, less is known about the interaction(s) between the two. 2. We manipulated the temperature of laboratory-based bacteria-protist communities that contained communities with one, two, or three trophic levels, and recorded species' densities and bacterial decomposition. 3. Temperature, food chain length and their interaction produced significant responses in microbial density and bacterial decomposition. Prey and resource density expressed different patterns of temperature dependency during different phases of population dynamics. The addition of a predator altered the temperature-density relationship of prey, from a unimodal trend to a negative one. Bacterial decomposition was greatest in the presence of consumers at higher temperatures. 4. These results are qualitatively consistent with a recent model of direct and indirect temperature effects on resource-consumer population dynamics. Results highlight and reinforce the importance of indirect effects of temperature mediated through trophic interactions. Understanding and predicting the consequences of environmental change will require that indirect effects, trophic structure, and individual species' tolerances be incorporated into theory and models.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01662.x,0
800,Microplastic vector effects: are fish at risk when exposed via the trophic chain?,"Abstract In aquatic organisms, trophic transfer is a relevant exposure route for microplastics (MPs). Despite their relevance, effect studies on fish exposed via trophic chains are currently very scarce. MPs are known to contain many chemicals that could be transferred to organisms and induce deleterious effects. However, there is currently no consensus on whether MPs represent a significant exposure pathway to chemicals in contaminated habitats. Here, we exposed three-spined sticklebacks ( Gasterosteus aculeatus ) to polyethylene MPs via prey ingestion, in a one-month experiment. MPs were either pristine or spiked with chlorpyrifos (CPF), and a CPF control was included to compare vector effects of MPs and natural prey. Following exposure, we assessed AChE activity and fish behavior (feeding, locomotion, environment exploration and reaction to the introduction of a novel object). No effect was observed in fish exposed to pristine MPs. CPF accumulation was observed in fish exposed to CPF-spiked MPs (MP-CPF), confirming the vector potential of MPs. However, CPF accumulation was more important in fish exposed to CPF via prey. In fish exposed to MP-CPF, we observed significant AChE inhibition and hyperactivity, which could result in increased vulnerability to predation. CPF organ distribution differed between groups, suggesting that chemical exposure via MPs could alter organ distribution of chemicals. This can result in a change in the organs most at risk, likely increasing intestine exposure.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.17.879478,0
801,"THE EFFECT OF CAYUNIS, EC FUNGICIDE ON VARIOUS LINKS OF THE TROPHIC CHAIN IN A MODEL EXPERIMENT","Currently, there is an ongoing process of development of the next-generation pesticides, which use for the purposes of agriculture has negative implications for the environment. Their hazard potential is attributable to two factors: high biological activity and their application method involving their dispersion in the environment. It necessitates the investigation of the effect of pesticides on aquatic organisms, which includes changes in their habitat, disruptions of their vital functions, especially at the early stages of their ontogeny, accumulation in their tissues, and movement along the trophic chain. Toxicological assessment of the fungicide Cayunis, EC effect has been conducted on the aquatic organisms of various taxonomic groups: microalgae (Scenedesmus guadricauda (Turpin) Brébisson, 1835), macrophytes (Elodea canadensis Michaux, 1803), molluscs ( Planorbarius corneus (Linnaeus, 1758)), embryos and fry of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814)). Over the course of the experiment, the conditions for intoxication were identified, and the toxicometric characteristics of the aquatic organisms belonging to various trophic levels were estimated. Using an experimental approach, the threshold and no observed effect concentrations of the preparative form of Cayunis, EC pesticide have been identified for each test subject. This study made it possible to compare the sensitivity of each investigated test subject to the fungicide. Among the studied test subjects, round goby fry has proved to be the most sensitive to the effect of Cayunis, EC fungicide.",https://doi.org/10.47921/2619-1024_2023_6_1_7,0
802,"Short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) in a freshwater food web from Dianshan Lake: Occurrence level, congener pattern and trophic transfer","Short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) are new group of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) listed in the Stockholm Convention. The Yangtze River Delta is among the industrially most developed areas in China, supporting a large production and consumption of chlorinated paraffins (CPs). Despite this, there is very limited data on the environmental exposure of SCCPs from the region. This study analyzed SCCPs in 14 wild aquatic organisms from Dianshan Lake, Shanghai, China. The concentrations of total SCCPs ranged from 10 to 1300μgg-1 lipid weight, with significantly higher levels (p<0.05) in benthic (benthic fish and invertebrates) than in non-benthic species (pelagic and mesopelagic fish). The abundance of C10 congeners was much higher in the benthic species compared to in the non-benthic species. The calculated trophic magnification factors (TMFs) of SCCP congeners varied from 1.19 (C10H12Cl10) to 1.57 (C13H20Cl8). The TMFs were significantly correlated (p<0.01) with carbon-chain length in a positive linear relationship and with Log Kow in a parabolic curve relationship. Considering the high concentrations of SCCPs in wild aquatic organisms and the trophic magnification observed in the freshwater food web, further studies should be undertaken to assess the environmental fate of SCCPs and the public health risk in the Yangtze River Delta.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.10.026,0
803,The return of the trophic chain: fundamental vs realized interactions in a simple arthropod food web,"Abstract The mathematical theory describing small assemblages of interacting species (community modules or motifs) has proved to be essential in understanding the emergent properties of ecological communities. These models use differential equations to study pairwise interactions between species. However, as community modules become more complex, it is not certain that all potential interactions will be effectively realized. Here, we use community modules to experimentally explore whether the number of trophic links among species scales with community complexity (i.e., by adding species known to feed on each other from pair-wise trials). To investigate this question, we used a simple mite community present in avocado orchards ( Persea americana ), composed of two predators ( Euseius stipulatus and Neoseiulus californicus ), one herbivore as shared prey ( Oligonychus perseae ), and pollen of Carpobrotus edulis as an alternative food resource. These configurations enabled the potential for (intraguild) predation and (apparent) competition to be expressed. Using a series of controls, we assessed whether the presence of one species affected the survival of another, or its conversion of food into offspring). We found that increasing the number of potential interactions did not result in more complex realized community modules. Instead, all communities were reduced to one or two linear trophic chains. Our results show that trophic links assumed to occur when species are assembled in pairs do not necessarily occur when other components of the community are present. Consequently, food-web structure may be unrealistic in theoretical community modules that are parameterized based on pair-wise interactions observed when alternative prey is absent. This further suggests the need for empirical research to work in concert with theoretical approaches to develop more realistic and predictive food-web models.",https://doi.org/10.1101/324178,0
804,Habitat complexity does not influence prey consumption in an experimental three-level trophic chain,"ABSTRACT Habitat complexity influences species diversity and regulates trophic interactions, mostly by increasing resource partitioning within habitats and providing refuge for prey. The influence of habitat complexity on more than two trophic levels is not well understood, mainly because behavioral modifications of prey and predator may influence the outcome of trophic interactions. Thus, we conducted a two-factor experiment with a three-level trophic chain: a piscivorous fish [Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus (Spix &amp; Agassiz 1829)], an invertivorous fish (Moenkhausia forestii Benine, Mariguela &amp; C. de Oliveira, 2009) and an aquatic macroinvertebrate (Chironomidae larvae). We measured prey consumption in low, intermediate and high habitat complexity, provided by submerged macrophyte densities, in the presence and the absence of the piscivore, intending to test the hypothesis that higher habitat complexities decrease predators foraging success in different trophic levels. We calculated the percentage of consumed prey in all treatment combinations. There was no significant effect of habitat complexity on prey consumption for neither the piscivorous nor the invertivorous fish, but a positive correlation was found between the percentages of consumed prey by both the piscivore and the invertivore. Observed modifications in the foraging behavior of the piscivore may have resulted in similar prey consumptions in low and high macrophyte densities. Moreover, more active M. forestii could have suffered a higher predation pressure by H. unitaeniatus, resulting in the positive correlation found. We conclude that behavior patterns in different habitat complexities possibly influenced predation rates in the three experimental trophic levels.",https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-4766e2018028,0
805,Trophic transfer of organochlorine pesticides through food-chain in coastal marine ecosystem,"The present study was designed to characterize the bioaccumulation of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in marine organisms (zooplankton, oyster, crab, and goby) on different trophic level. In the present study, sedentary bivalve (oyster) showed strong correlations in OCPs levels with surface sediment in the study area. This indicates the two compartments can be used as alternative for pollution monitoring of OCPs even in narrow scale in space. Bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of OCPs was strongly associated with their hydrophobicity (i.e., KOW). HCHs with log KOW < 5 did not show any enrichment through food-chain. However, log BAF values of OCPs with log KOW > 5 positioned over the 1:1 lines of log BAF and log KOW of the top predator, indicating the greater fugacities in the higher trophic level and thus the occurrence of biomagnification via ingestion. Based on trophic transfer factors (TTF), more hydrophobic OCPs with log KOW > 5 were enriched by several to several ten times in the highest trophic level relative to the lowest trophic level. This finding can be used in the establishment of marine environmental water quality criteria by considering biomagnification factors (TTF in this study) of OCPs.

807,Complex trophic interactions in freshwater benthic food chains,"Complex trophic interactions play an important role in structuring benthic communities in lakes and streams. In this review of freshwater, benthic food chains, a variety of different types of complex interactions were identified, including trophic cascades, interaction modifications and indirect commensalisms. The strength of these interactions varied greatly among studies, depending on habitat complexity, the type and intensity of environmental stresses, the ways in which prey defended themselves from predators, and the degree of trophic omnivory in the food chain. Areas that deserve further study include the effect of trophic omnivory on interaction strength and indirect effects of piscivores in benthic communities. Future studies should include whole-system, long-term manipulations to deepen our understanding of the role of complex interactions in freshwater communities.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-0348-8880-6_3,0
808,Habitat loss causes long transients in small trophic chains,"Abstract Transients in ecology are extremely important since they determine how equilibria are approached. The debate on the dynamic stability of ecosystems has been largely focused on equilibrium states. However, since ecosystems are constantly changing due to climate conditions or to perturbations such as the climate crisis or anthropogenic actions (habitat destruction, deforestation, or defaunation), it is important to study how dynamics can proceed till equilibria. In this contribution we investigate dynamics and transient phenomena in small food chains using mathematical models. We are interested in the impact of habitat loss in ecosystems with vegetation undergoing facilitation. We provide a thorough dynamical study of a small food chain system given by three trophic levels: vegetation, herbivores, and predators. The dynamics of the vegetation alone suffers a saddle-node bifurcation, causing extremely long transients. The addition of a herbivore introduces a remarkable number of new phenomena. Specifically, we show that, apart from the saddle node involving the extinction of the full system, a transcritical and a supercritical Hopf-Andronov bifurcation allow for the coexistence of vegetation and herbivores via non-oscillatory and oscillatory dynamics, respectively. Furthermore, a global transition given by a heteroclinic bifurcation is also shown to cause a full extinction. The addition of a predator species to the previous systems introduces further complexity and dynamics, also allowing for the coupling of different transient phenomena such as ghost transients and transient oscillations after the heteroclinic bifurcation. Our study shows how the increase of ecological complexity via addition of new trophic levels and their associated nonlinear interactions may modify dynamics, bifurcations, and transient phenomena.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.15.098863,0

In the laboratory we studied trophic uptake and transfer of phytoplankton-DMSP through simple planktonic food chains using 2 experimental approaches: (1) A direct approach measured the ingestion and retention of phytoplankton-DMSP by the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Gyrodinium dominans. Overall, DMSP content of G. dominans estimated by the direct approach was highly variable, likely because of the low G. dominans biomass relative to phytoplankton in the samples. (2) An indirect approach, in which the omnivorous copepod Acartia tonsa was allowed to prey on a mixture of phytoplankton and G. dominans. Using this indirect approach, A. tonsa retained a high concentration of G. dominans biomass in its guts. Combined with other feeding parameters, the copepod gut contents were used to derive the DMSP content of G. dominans. When fed on Phaeocystis globosa, G. dominans retained 1.64 x 10-4 nmol DMSP cell-1, or 44% of the grazed DMSP. When fed on Isochrysis galbana, the protozoan retained 6.87 x 10-5 nmol DMSP cell-1, or 32% of the grazed DMSP. A. tonsa selectively preyed on G. dominans when offered a mixture of G. dominans and phytoplankton, deriving 63 to 84% of their dietary DMSP from the protozoan. Our study suggests that protozoans are an important trophic linkage to transfer phytoplankton-DMSP up food chains, and that the effectiveness of this linkage is dependent on the species composition of both the phytoplankton and the higher trophic levels.

810,"Extreme events, trophic chain reactions, and shifts in phenotypic selection","Abstract The demographic effects of rapid environmental change and extreme climatic events (ECEs) can cascade across trophic levels, while the potential evolutionary implications have rarely been explored empirically. Here, we show how an ECE in high Arctic Svalbard triggered a trophic chain reaction, affecting overwintering and migratory vertebrates, which eventually induced a shift in density-dependent phenotypic selection in barnacle geese. A record-breaking rain-on-snow event and ice-locked pastures led to reindeer mass starvation and a population crash, followed by a period of low mortality and population recovery. This caused lagged, long-lasting reductions in reindeer carrion numbers and resultant low abundances of the Arctic fox, a scavenger on reindeer and predator of migratory birds. The associated shift in gosling predation rates by Arctic foxes allowed for a rapid increase in barnacle goose population density. As expected from r- and K-selection theory, we show that the goose body condition maximising Malthusian fitness increased with this shift in population density. Thus, the ECE acting directly on the overwintering community indirectly led to selection for larger geese. This high Arctic case study provides rare empirical evidence of links between ECEs, community dynamics and evolution, with implications for how we understand the indirect eco-evolutionary impacts of global change.",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1465066/v1,0
811,"Species functional traits, trophic control and the ecosystem consequences of adaptive foraging in the middle of food chains","An ecosystem is often defined simply as a community of organisms interacting with each other and their biophysical environment. This definition arose from early conceptions of how the natural world is organized and is elegant in its simplicity because it captures the basic elements of a functioning system (Tansley 1935; Leopold 1939; Lindeman 1942). But those trying to develop a synthetic, empirical understanding of how ecosystems function and how they will respond to environmental change are abundantly aware that there is much inherent complexity implied by this seemingly simple definition. To cope with this complexity, ecologists have traditionally abstracted one part of the definition and elaborated the other. For example, ecosystem ecologists have long assumed that interacting organisms can be simply assigned to different compartments (e.g., producer, primary and secondary consumer, decomposer) and focused on environmental and biophysical aspects that dictate the transformation and flow of materials and energy among various compartments (Lindeman 1942; Odum 1969; Likens et al. 1970). In contrast, community ecologists have downplayed the biophysical aspects of materials and energy transfer and focused on organismal populations (Shelford 1913; Elton 1927; Hutchinson 1957; Paine 1966; MacArthur 1972), their diversity and the myriad interactions (e.g., predation, competition, facilitation) that determine their distribution and abundance (Reiners 1986; DeAngelis 1992).",https://doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511736551.022,0

813,The trophic transfer via a picoplankton-flagellate-copepod food chain during a picocyanobacterial bloom in Lake Biwa trab:4,"We examined whether or not the production of autotrophic picoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria (collectively, picoplankton) is funnelled up food web via a picoplankton-nanoflagellate-copepod food chain during a picocyanobacterial bloom in Lake Biwa. The experiment was carried out in late summer when the abundance of picocyanobacteria was of its seasonal maximum (7x10 5 cells ml -1 ) and copepods (Eodiaptomus japonicus) dominated the mesozooplankton assemblage. The grazing rates of a mesozooplankton assemblage on nanoflagellates and picoplankton were determined from changes in apparent growth rates of nanoflagellates and picoplankton with increasing mesozooplankton biomass in incubation bottles. Results indicated that the mesozooplankton assemblage consumed nanoflagellates but not picoplankton directly. Dilution culture experiments revealed that the production of picoplankton was mostly consumed by protozoan grazers in the cell-size fraction of <20 μm (nanoflagellates). Carbon flux estimates indicated that of total carbon channelled from picoplankton to nanoflagellates (630 mg Cm -2 day -1 ), only 2 % was passed to mesozooplankton. The carbon from nanoflagellates accounted for <5 % of the total carbon consumption by mesozooplankton. Thus, the picoplankton-nanoflagellate-mesozooplankton trophic link was extremely inefficient and contributed little to the production of mesozooplankton dominated by copepods during a picocyanobacterial bloom in Lake Biwa.",https://doi.org/10.1127/archiv-hydrobiol/137/1996/145,0
814,Trophic Magnification of Short- and Medium-Chain Chlorinated Paraffins in Terrestrial Food Webs and Their Bioamplification in Insects and Amphibians during Metamorphosis,"Studies on the biomagnification of short- and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs and MCCPs) in terrestrial ecosystems and their bioamplification during metamorphosis in insects and amphibians are scarce. Therefore, this study sought to characterize the occurrence and trophic dynamics of SCCPs and MCCPs in an insect-dominated terrestrial food web in an e-waste recycling site in South China. Median ∑SCCPs and ∑MCCPs concentrations in the organisms ranged from 2200 to 34 000 ng/g lipid weight and from 990 to 19 000 ng/g lipid weight, respectively. The homologue profiles of CPs in the predators were distinct from those in insects, presenting more short chain-high chlorinated congeners (C10–12Cl8–10). The trophic magnification factors (TMFs) of ∑SCCPs and ∑MCCPs were 2.08 and 2.45, respectively, indicating biomagnification in the terrestrial food web. A significant positive relationship between the TMFs and octanol-air partition coefficients was observed. TMFs were also positively correlated with chlorination degree but did not correlate with carbon chain length. Nonlinear correlations between metamorphosis-associated bioamplification and the octanol–water partition coefficients of SCCPs and MCCPs were observed for insects, whereas negative linear correlations were observed for amphibians, which suggested species-specific alterations to the chemicals during metamorphosis.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c03096,0
815,A triple trophic boost: How carbon emissions indirectly change a marine food chain,"The pervasive enrichment of CO2 in our oceans is a well-documented stressor to marine life. Yet, there is little understanding about how CO2 affects species indirectly in naturally complex communities. Using natural CO2 vents, we investigated the indirect effects of CO2 enrichment through a marine food chain. We show how CO2 boosted the biomass of three trophic levels: from the primary producers (algae), through to their grazers (gastropods), and finally through to their predators (fish). We also found that consumption by both grazers and predators intensified under CO2 enrichment, but, ultimately, this top-down control failed to compensate for the boosted biomass of both primary producers and herbivores (bottom-up control). Our study suggests that indirect effects can buffer the ubiquitous and direct, negative effects of CO2 enrichment by allowing the upward propagation of resources through the food chain. Maintaining the natural complexity of food webs in our ocean communities could, therefore, help minimize the future impacts of CO2 enrichment.",https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14536,0
816,Parental and trophic transfer of nanoscale plastic debris in an assembled aquatic food chain as a function of particle size,"The existing limitations in analytical techniques for characterization and quantification of nanoscale plastic debris (NPD) in organisms hinder understanding of the parental and trophic transfer of NPD in organisms. Herein, we used iron oxide-doped polystyrene (PS) NPD (Fe-PS-NPD) of 270 nm and Europium (Eu)-doped PS-NPD (Eu-PS-NPD) of 640 nm to circumvent these limitations and to evaluate the influence of particle size on the trophic transfer of NPD along an algae-daphnids food chain and on the reproduction of daphnids fed with NPD-exposed algae. We used Fe and Eu as proxies for the Fe-PS-NPD and Eu-Ps-NPD, respectively. The algae cells (Pseudokirchinella subcapitata) were exposed to 4.8 × 1010 particles/L of Fe-PS-NPD or Eu-PS-NPD for 72 h. A high percentage (>60%) of the NPD was associated with algal cells. Only a small fraction (<11%) of the NPD, however, was transferred to daphnids fed for 21 days on the NPD-exposed algae. The uptake and trophic transfer of the 270 nm Fe-PS-NPD were higher than those for the 640 nm Eu-PS-NPD, indicating that smaller NPD are more likely to transfer along food chains. After exposure to Fe-PS-NPD, the time to first brood was prolonged and the number of neonates per adult significantly decreased compared to the control without any exposure and compared to daphnids exposed to the Eu-Ps-NPD. The offspring of daphnids exposed to Eu-PS-NPD through algae, showed a traceable concentration of Eu, suggesting that NPD are transferred from parents to offspring. We conclude that NPD can be transferred in food chains and caused reproductive toxicity as a function of NPD size. Studies with prolonged exposure and weathered NPD are endeavored to increase environmental realism of the impacts determined.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.116066,0
817,Mercury and Selenium in Stranded Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins and Implications for Their Trophic Transfer in Food Chains,"As top predators in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) of China, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) are bioindicators for examining regional trends of environmental contaminants in the PRE. We examined samples from stranded S. chinensis in the PRE, collected since 2004, to study the distribution and fate of total mercury (THg), methylmercury (MeHg) and selenium (Se) in the major tissues, in individuals at different ages and their prey fishes from the PRE. This study also investigated the potential protective effects of Se against the toxicities of accumulated THg. Dolphin livers contained the highest concentrations of THg (32.34±58.98 µg g−1 dw) and Se (15.16±3.66 µg g−1 dw), which were significantly different from those found in kidneys and muscles, whereas the highest residue of MeHg (1.02±1.11 µg g−1 dw) was found in dolphin muscles. Concentrations of both THg and MeHg in the liver, kidney and muscle of dolphins showed a significantly positive correlation with age. The biomagnification factors (BMFs) of inorganic mercury (Hginorg) in dolphin livers (350×) and MeHg in muscles (18.7×) through the prey fishes were the highest among all three dolphin tissues, whereas the BMFs of Se were much lower in all dolphin tissues. The lower proportion of MeHg in THg and higher Se/THg ratios in tissues were demonstrated. Our studies suggested that S. chinensis might have the potential to detoxify Hg via the demethylation of MeHg and the formation of tiemannite (HgSe) in the liver and kidney. The lower threshold of hepatic THg concentrations for the equimolar accumulation of Se and Hg in S. chinensis suggests that this species has a greater sensitivity to THg concentrations than is found in striped dolphins and Dall's porpoises.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0110336,0

819,Longer Food Chains in Pelagic Ecosystems: Trophic Energetics of Animal Body Size and Metabolic Efficiency,"Factors constraining the structure of food webs can be investigated by comparing classes of ecosystems. We find that pelagic ecosystems, those based on one-celled primary producers, have longer food chains than terrestrial ecosystems. Yet pelagic ecosystems have lower primary productivity, contrary to the hypothesis that greater energy flows permit higher trophic levels. We hypothesize that longer food chain length in pelagic ecosystems, compared with terrestrial ecosystems, is associated with smaller pelagic animal body size permitting more rapid trophic energy transfer. Assuming negative allometric dependence of biomass production rate on body mass at each trophic level, the lowest three pelagic animal trophic levels are estimated to add biomass more rapidly than their terrestrial counterparts by factors of 12, 4.8, and 2.6. Pelagic animals consequently transport primary production to a fifth trophic level 50-190 times more rapidly than animals in terrestrial webs. This difference overcomes the approximately fivefold slower pelagic basal productivity, energetically explaining longer pelagic food chains. In addition, ectotherms, dominant at lower pelagic animal trophic levels, have high metabolic efficiency, also favoring higher rates of trophic energy transfer in pelagic ecosystems. These two animal trophic flow mechanisms imply longer pelagic food chains, reestablishing an important role for energetics in food web structure.",https://doi.org/10.1086/686880,0

Traditionally, theoretical ecologists have used resource-dependent functional responses to explain the modification of food chains exposed to bottom-up perturbations. These models predict alternating positive, negative and zero responses at each trophic level. More recently, ratio-dependent functional response models that predict proportional increases at each level have challenged this paradigm. The present study tested the predictions of the 2 hypotheses empirically by comparing the relative biomasses of 4 trophic levels of an estuarine seagrass food chain in relatively undisturbed, low-nutrient catchments and ‘developed’ catchments subjected to a prolonged period of nutrient enrichment. We found that nutrient-enriched sites had significantly greater biomass of both epiphytic algae and grazing invertebrates; however, the bottom-up forcing of nutrients was attenuated at higher trophic levels (occupied by juvenile and piscivorous fish), with no significant effect of catchment development. This disconnect in the upward cascade of energy may be due to a number of possible reasons including high levels of diversity and omnivory, trophic subsidy within the system or the strength or nature of perturbations. Although the predictions of both hypotheses failed to hold across all trophic groups, ratio dependence was prevalent at the lower levels of the food chain, which has implications for catchment management.

821,Dissolution of Silver Nanoparticles in Stratified Estuarine Mesocosms and Silver Accumulation in a Simple Planktonic Freshwater Trophic Chain,"The increasing presence of nanomaterials in consumer products has led the scientific community to study the environmental fate of these contaminants of emerging concern. Silver nanoparticles, used mainly for their antibacterial properties, are among the most common nanomaterials. Understanding their transformations and interactions with living organisms, especially under environmentally relevant conditions that can modify metal bioavailability, is a crucial step in the study of their impacts on aquatic ecosystems. In the present study, citrate-coated silver nanoparticles (20 nm; 10 µg/L) were added to the surface freshwater layer of mesocosms simulating a stratified estuary. The investigation by dialysis of the nanoparticle dissolution showed that a large amount of total silver was found in the freshwater layer (and a very low amount in the seawater layer) and that 5–15% was in the form of dissolved silver. These results indicate that the halocline, separating fresh water from seawater, acted as a strong density barrier limiting the sedimentation of the nanoparticles. A simple trophic chain, composed of the freshwater alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the invertebrate Daphnia magna, was used to determine silver bioavailability. This study suggests that citrate-coated silver nanoparticles do not significantly contribute to Ag accumulation by algae but may do so for invertebrates.",https://doi.org/10.3390/environments9020020,0

The lakes are located in the sparsely populated area of eastern Sikhote-Alin including the Sikhote-Alin biosphere nature reserve. The content of Fe, Mn, Ni, and Pb has a tendency to decrease along the trophic chain that is conditioned by prevalence of their suspended forms over dissolved ones in the water and decreasing of the surface : weight ratio with size of living organisms.

823,Polystyrene microplastics alter the trophic transfer and biotoxicity of fluoxetine in an aquatic food chain,"Microplastics (MPs) and fluoxetine are ubiquitous emerging pollutants in aquatic environments that may interact with each other due to the carrier effects of MPs, posing unpredictable risks to non-target organisms. However, limited studies have focused on the carrier effects of MPs in the aquatic food chain. This study evaluated the influences of polystyrene MPs on the trophic transfer and biotoxicity of fluoxetine in a simple food chain composed of brine shrimp (Artemia nauplii) and zebrafish (Danio rerio). The findings revealed that carrier effects of MPs enhanced the accumulation of waterborne fluoxetine in brine shrimp, but suppressed that in zebrafish due to the distinct retention times. The accumulated fluoxetine in shrimp was further transferred to fish through the food chain, which was alleviated by MPs due to their cleaning effects. In addition, the specific neurotransmission biotoxicity in fish induced by fluoxetine was mitigated by MPs, whilst the oxidative damage, apoptosis, and immune responses in zebrafish were reversely enhanced by MPs due to the stimulating effect. These findings highlight the alleviating effects of MPs on the trophic transfer and specific biotoxicity of fluoxetine in the food chain, providing new insights into the carrier effects of MPs in aquatic environments in the context of increasing global MP pollution. The ubiquitous microplastics in aquatic environments have attracted rapidly increasing attention due to their potential threats to aquatic organisms, particularly on their carrier effects. However, the knowledge regarding the carrier effects is still poorly understood in the food chain. Herein, we investigated the influences of microplastics on the trophic transfer of co-existing fluoxetine in the food chain. The results revealed that the carrier effects of microplastics alleviated the trophic transfer of fluoxetine in the food chain and the specific biotoxicity through cleaning effect. This finding provides new insights into the potential risks of microplastics under the increasing global microplastic pollution.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134179,0
824,Alleviative Effects of C<sub>60</sub> on the Trophic Transfer of Cadmium along the Food Chain in Aquatic Environment,"C60 could enhance the accumulation of pollutants in organisms, but their effects on higher trophic levels remain unknown. In the present study, the transfer of C60 from Daphnia magna to zebrafish (Danio rerio) and its effects on Cd transfer were investigated. The results showed that C60 could be transferred from D. magna to zebrafish through dietary exposure and accumulate mainly in the intestines, but biomagnification was not observed. The presence of C60 promoted accumulation of Cd in D. magna. However, it decreased Cd burden in the higher trophic level (zebrafish), displaying an alleviative effect on the trophic transfer of Cd along the food chain. To explore the underlying mechanisms, the release of Cd from D. magna in digestive fluids and changes in zebrafish digestive physiology were further investigated. The results showed that C60 did not inhibit Cd release from D. magna, but stimulated the digestive tracts of zebrafish to excrete Cd earlier and in a greater amount, which consequently lowered assimilation efficiency of Cd in zebrafish. Overall, the present study showed the trophic transfer of C60 in the aquatic food chain and revealed the effects of C60 on trophic transfer of Cd along the food chain in aquatic environment.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b01636,0
825,Nematodes as Important Source for Omega-3 Long-Chain Fatty Acids in the Soil Food Web and the Impact in Nutrition for Higher Trophic Levels,"PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids) content of food sources, in particular 3 long-chain PUFA with three or more double bonds, are considered essential for growth, reproduction, and neural development of higher animals. Surprisingly, and in contrast to aquatic ecosystems, 3 long-chain PUFA seem not widely available in terrestrial food webs. Far-reaching ideas indeed proclaim aquatic ecosystems as the principal source of these long-chain PUFA in the whole biosphere, including inhabitants of terrestrial ecosystems. Interestingly, de novo synthesis of 3 long-chain PUFA, which requires the presence of Δ12 (fat-2) and 3 (fat-1) desaturases absent in vertebrates, has been observed in nematodes, such as Caenorhabditis elegans. This raises the question if nematodes or other soil invertebrates present an important trophic link offering substantial supply in these valuable nutritional compounds in terrestrial food webs. This work followed the dietary routing of fatty acids of different C. elegans strains, including mutants defective in the PUFA biosynthesis, to two omnivorous Collembola species, Folsomia candida and Protaphorura fimata. The laboratory approach comprised microcosms offering binary links under various feeding conditions and analyzed growth, fecundity and dietary preference of consumers. Collembola did not prefer individual C. elegans strains as food source but they clearly reflected the PUFA-richness or -poorness of their nematode prey in their neutral lipid fraction. Moreover, Collembola did benefit from 3 long-chain PUFA rich diet, as shown by significant weight gain and increased number of laid eggs. Interestingly, the comparatively high PUFA-content of Collembola's phospholipid fraction remained unchanged, even in response to almost PUFA-depleted nematode prey, suggesting that these Collembola species also possess the metabolic capability to de novo synthesize PUFA, including 3 long-chain forms. These findings broaden the basis of long-chain PUFA sources in terrestrial food webs and question the impact of aquatic ecosystems as principal source.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2018.00096,0

Growing awareness on this issue has led to an increase in studies on the effects of microplastics on freshwater organisms, although there are still few investigations on possible transfer of this contaminant along water trophic chains from producers to primary consumers. In this study, aquatic herbivorous larvae of the moth Cataclysta lemnata were fed on microplastic-free (control) and contaminated (MPs treatment) Lemna minuta fronds. For treatments, Lemna fronds were grown in mineral water enriched with fluorescent microparticles of poly(styrene-co-methyl methacrylate) (MPs, 100 mg/L) and then fed to the larvae as a food source. Microplastics effects on larvae were tested at 0, 7, 14 and 21 days of exposure, corresponding to sensitive phases of the insect life cycle. Contaminant impact was assessed based on some parameters such as viability, larva body size/weight, feeding alterations and regularity of the insect life cycle. Using scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy, the presence of microplastics in the larvae was verified. The finding of fluorescent microplastics in both the intestinal lumen and excrement samples showed that larvae ingested contaminated Lemna fronds. In addition, larvae fed contaminated fronds were strongly affected by the presence of microplastic contaminant over time, showing high mortality (90 %) and total inability to complete the life cycle after 21 days by failing to reach the winged adult phase. In control tests, survival rates were higher than in treatments, and 50 % of the larvae managed to pupate and emerge as moths, reaching the adult phase. The results show that there was a trophic transfer of microplastics from producer to primary consumer along a freshwater food chain, generating negative effects on the life cycle of this aquatic herbivore.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164459,0
828,Chaos Control of a Delayed Tri-Trophic Food Chain Model with Fear and Its Carry Over Effects,"One of the main objectives of theoretical ecologists involves finding mechanisms to control the chaos in ecological models to maintain positive densities of the species. Numerous researchers have suggested that, apart from the direct killing in the prey–predator relationship, there are some indirect effects, such as fear of predation. Induced fear can lead to slowing down the growth rate of the prey species, and this non-chemical strategy can be carried over to successive seasons or upcoming generations. In this work, we explore the impact of fear due to predation and its carry-over effect (COE) in a delayed tri-trophic food chain model, whereas the Holling type-II functional response is used to determine the interference among the species. The proposed model is an asymmetric interaction food chain model since the species in this model only kills other species. The growth rate of prey and middle predators is affected due to the respective fear of predation by middle and special predators. The non-delayed model considered in this paper generalizes the models developed by Hastings–Powell and Panday et al. The gestation delay in the special predator’s growth term is incorporated into the proposed model. We determined the essential conditions for the existence of ecologically feasible equilibrium points and their local and global stability. Furthermore, we developed the conditions for the occurrence of the Hopf bifurcation around an interior equilibrium to seek periodic behaviors of delayed and non-delayed models. Numerical examples were performed to justify the proposed theoretical findings and to show the impacts of fear and its COE parameters on the system dynamics through phase portraits, the time series of solutions, and bifurcation diagrams. We discovered that the chaotic behavior of the food chain model can be controlled by using the fear effect and its COE parameters. The dynamics of the delayed food chain model with the fear effect and its COEs are further explored in our findings. Our theoretical findings clearly provide a mechanism to protect and control species populations in ecological systems. It is also essential for developing optimized harvesting strategies in fisheries and pest management in agriculture.",https://doi.org/10.3390/sym15020484,0
829,Top of the food chains: an ecological network of the marine Paja Formation biota from the Early Cretaceous of Colombia reveals the highest trophic levels ever estimated,"Abstract The Mesozoic Marine Revolution restructured the world’s ocean biodiversity into the complex marine ecosystems of today. This revolution began during the Triassic but the origin of this complexity is poorly understood due to a lack of detailed ecosystem reconstructions throughout time. We present the first site-specific ecological network for a marine Mesozoic fauna based on the Early Cretaceous Paja Formation biota of Colombia that preserves numerous, large-bodied, predatory marine reptiles. The trophic food-web was quantitatively reconstructed based on inferred trophic interactions of marine producers, consumers, and large apex predators. Compared to well-studied Caribbean reef ecosystem networks, the Paja biota network is missing a great proportion of benthic invertebrates and fishes, despite its rich higher trophic levels. We hypothesize that the ammonites from the Paja biota either mirrored the diversity represented by some fishes today or established a novel trophic unit with no living analogue. Recalibrating the Paja biota network to trophic analogues in the Caribbean, such as sea turtles, estimates that the largest Paja marine reptile hyper-apex predators occupied trophic levels a full tier higher than any extant marine apex predator. The Paja biota network is a starting point to tracing the evolution of marine ecosystems across the Mesozoic Marine Revolution.",https://doi.org/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlad092,0
830,You are what your host eats: The trophic structure and food chain length of a symbiont community are coupled with the plastic diet of the host ant,"Abstract Food chain length provides key information on the flow of nutrients and energy in ecosystems. Variation in food chain length has primarily been explained by environmental drivers such as ecosystem size and productivity. Most insights are obtained from theory or aquatic systems, but the importance of these drivers remains largely untested in terrestrial systems. We exploited red wood ant nests markedly differing in size as natural experiments to quantify the drivers of trophic structure and food chain length of their symbiont arthropod communities. Using stable isotopes, we explored the variation in the trophic positions of four symbiont species with the trophic position of the top predator as a proxy for food chain length of the symbiont community. Nest size did not affect food chain length, nor trophic distance between the symbionts. Instead, food chain length and the trophic positions of the symbionts were strongly affected by the host's foraging decisions. When the host diet shifted from predominantly herbivorous to more predacious, the trophic position of the symbionts and food chain length strongly increased. We show for the first time that a food web can be structured by biotic interactions with an engineering species rather than by abiotic environmental variables.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13994,0
831,Stability and bifurcation analysis of a tri-trophic food chain model with intraguild predation,"The dynamics of a three-component model for food web with intraguild predation is considered. The model is based on the collection of ordinary differential equations that describe the interactions among prey, intermediate predator and top predator. First, the model without self-limitation of the predators is studied. Boundedness of the system and existence of non-negative solutions are established. The local stability analysis of the equilibria is carried out to examine the behavior of the system. The possibility of Hopf bifurcation around non-negative equilibria with consumption rates as bifurcation parameters is studied. Center manifold theorem and the normal form theory are applied to obtain the formulas for determining the direction of Hopf bifurcation and the stability of bifurcating periodic solutions. Numerical simulations support the analytical findings, which show that the extinction of one of the predators can occur under certain restrictions on the predation rate of the top predator. Subsequently, numerical analysis of the model with self-limitation of the predators is carried out. Simulations reveal that the system with intraspecific competition in the predator populations can reproduce coexistence between the three species in resource-rich environment.",https://doi.org/10.1142/s1793524522500735,0
832,"Coexistence, Energy, and Trophic Cascade in a Three-Level Food Chain Integrating Body Sizes","Predation is a biological interaction that influences demographic patterns by modifying community structure. In the current ecological crisis, there is a need to better understand the conditions of coexistence between predators, prey and their resources. The body size is considered a key feature to explain community-scale phenomena, energetic, and evolutionary constraints. This raises the question of how species body size directly or indirectly affects the demographic patterns that enable coexistence. Considering the above, we conducted a theoretical study that implements a Rosenzweig-MacArthur type model, which represents a three-level chain that integrates body sizes and includes a Holling type I functional response. In this model, we characterize coexistence through body size-dependent net reproductive rates. Our results suggest that the body sizes of consumer species strongly affect the size-density relations and energy requirements. We obtain the negative relationship between body size and density of intermediate consumers and discuss the energy equivalence rule. Furthermore, larger predators have a more significant impact on the intensity of the trophic cascade than smaller predators. Finally, we discuss potential extensions and applications of our modeling approach.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.821176,0
833,Higher reproductive performance of a piscivorous avian predator feeding on lower trophic-level diets on ponds with shorter food chains,"Abstract Variation in food-chain length may influence a predator’s trophic position. In aquatic food webs, the energy value of prey typically increases with its trophic rank; hence a higher trophic-level diet is often assumed to indicate better habitat quality. We related the body and health condition of pre-fledged Red-necked Grebes Podiceps grisegena to their dietary trophic level (estimated using stable nitrogen isotope signals of feathers) in two managed pond habitats with contrasting prey availability due to different fish population structures. Ponds stocked with young, small common carp Cyprinus carpio provided abundant fish and non-fish (insects and amphibians) resources for chicks. In ponds stocked with large carp, which also supported populations of small predatory fish, the breeding success of grebes was comparatively poor, because carp exceeded the size suitable for chicks and adversely affected non-fish prey. Pre-fledged grebes were in better condition (greater body mass, lower heterophil/lymphocyte ratio) in the food-rich small-fish ponds than in the food-poor ponds dominated by large fish. Values for δ 15 N suggested shorter food chains and a lower trophic-level diet for grebes in the food-rich ponds. Bayesian carbon and nitrogen isotope mixing models demonstrated the dietary prominence of small fish, both carp and predatory species. Between-habitat differences in food-chain length and grebe trophic position resulted from the higher trophic rank of small predatory fish in the food-poor ponds compared to the omnivorous carp in the food-rich ponds. Our results suggest that in aquatic food webs, feeding at higher trophic levels by strongly size-limited generalist avian predators can be associated with overall food scarcity due to the impact of fish, and thus trophic status cannot be used uncritically as a proxy for aquatic habitat quality.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10336-021-01910-z,0
834,Detrital food chain as a possible mechanism to support the trophic structure of the planktonic community in the photic zone of a tropical reservoir,"espanolEn la zona fotica de los ecosistemas acuaticos, donde coexisten diferentes componentes de la comunidad con diferentes estrategias para acceder a uno o diferentes recursos, el espectro de biomasa puede describir las transferencias alimenticias y sus eficiencias. El proposito de este trabajo es describir el espectro de biomasa y la eficiencia de transferencia, desde los productores primarios hasta los principales depredadores de la red trofica, en la zona fotica del embalse de Riogrande II. Los datos utilizados en el modelo del espectro de biomasa se tomaron de varias investigaciones realizadas en este embalse entre 2010 y 2013. El analisis de los resultados de la pendiente del espectro de biomasa, de las eficiencias de transferencias, y de los indices omnivoria, sugieren que la mayoria de la produccion primaria en la zona fotica del embalse Riogrande II es escasamente utilizada directamente por los consumidores primarios, y parece que los flujos de masa detriticos son una forma indirecta de canalizar esta produccion hacia el zooplankton. De acuerdo con esto, las eficiencias optimas en la transferencia de masa entre productores y consumidores reflejadas por la pendiente del espectro de biomasa (cercana a -1), no se deben necesariamente a la cadena de pastoreo, sino que pueden ser el resultado del acoplamiento entre varias rutas alimenticias (detritica y pastoreo) que comienzan con la produccion primaria EnglishIn the photic zone of aquatic ecosystems, where different communities coexist showing different strategies to access one or different resources, the biomass spectra can describe the food transfers and their efficiencies. The purpose of this work is to describe the biomass spectrum and the transfer efficiency, from the primary producers to the top predators of the trophic network, in the photic zone of the Riogrande II reservoir. Data used in the model of the biomass spectrum were taken from several studies carried out between 2010 and 2013 in the reservoir. The analysis of the slope of a biomass spectrum, of the transfer efficiencies, and the omnivory indexes, suggest that most primary production in the photic zone of the Riogrande II reservoir is not directly used by primary consumers, and it appears that detritic mass flows are an indirect way of channeling this production towards zooplankton. Accordingly, the optimal efficiencies in mass transfer between producers and consumers reflected by the slope of the biomass spectrum (close to -1), are not necessarily linked to the grazing chains, but may be the result of the coupling between several food routes (detritic and grazing) that start with primary production",https://doi.org/10.23818/limn.39.33,0
835,Stable isotopes reveal that bottom-up omnivory drives food chain length and trophic position in eutrophic coastal ecosystems,"Abstract In coastal marine food webs, food chain length and the distribution of trophic levels mediate the impacts of emerging threats such as overfishing, pollution, and climate change, through their effect on essential properties such as productivity, connectivity, and energy transfer efficiency. These two components of food web structure are therefore an essential element of ecosystem-based management; however, what drives them remains poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that high primary production drives lower trophic levels and shorter food chain length in coastal regions. Here, we evaluate this hypothesis on the British Columbia (BC) coast as this coastal marine ecosystem is comprised of regions with contrasting levels of primary production. We measured nitrogen stable isotopes from zooplankton, micronekton, and nekton collected from four of the main water bodies of southern BC during a survey completed in August of 2019. We used Sentinel-3 satellite data to determine overall production in each region across a 5-year climatology and during the 2019 season. Results showed that primary production varied significantly between the four regions and that increases in phytoplankton biomass were driven by increases in microphytoplankton. Nitrogen isotope data demonstrated a significant inverse relationship between a region’s primary production and both total food chain length and trophic level in species sampled in multiple regions, but no change in the trophic structure of the zooplankton community across regions. Changes in species’ trophic levels were therefore driven by shifts in the level of zooplanktivory. These results support a model of bottom-up omnivory driving coastal food web structure, where levels of primary production, specifically biomass of microphytoplankton, determine food chain length and the distribution of trophic levels. High microphytoplankton biomass supports a large biomass of large grazing zooplankton, which drive increases in omnivorous feeding behaviour among the micronekton and nekton.",https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsac171,0
836,Trophic Transfer of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes at the Base of the Food Chain and Toxicological Response,"The potential for trophic transfer of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) was assessed using the green algae Tetraselmis suecica and the blue mussel Mytilus edulis in a series of laboratory experiments. Swanee River Natural Organic Matter (SRNOM)-dispersed SWCNTs were introduced into growing algal cultures. Light microscopical observations, confirmed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy, showed that SWCNT agglomerates adhered to the external algal cell walls and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) results suggested internalization. A direct effect of SWCNT exposure on the algae was a significant decrease in growth, expressed as chlorophyll a concentration and cell viability. Mussels, fed with algae in the presence of SWCNTs, led to significantly increased pseudofaeces production, indicating selective feeding. Nevertheless, histological sections of the mussel digestive gland following exposure showed evidence of SWCNT-containing algae. Furthermore, DNA damage and oxidative stress biomarker responses in the mussel haemocytes and gill tissue were significantly altered from baseline values and were consistent with previously observed responses to SWCNT exposure. In conclusion, the observed SWCNT-algal interaction demonstrated the potential for SWCNT entrance at the base of the food chain, which may facilitate their trophic transfer with potential consequences for human exposure and health.",https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12244363,0
837,Predicted impacts of global change on bottom-up trophic interactions in the plant-ungulate-wolf food chain in boreal forests,"Global warming has been accelerating as atmospheric CO2 has risen. The mean annual temperature in boreal forests has increased by 1.5 °C or more, which has profound impacts on plants and wildlife. This overview explores available literature, identifies current knowledge gaps, highlights hypotheses about the cascading effects of global warming in a boreal forest food chain, and suggests future research directions. Our climate-driven bottom-up trophic interaction hypotheses explore climate change effects on boreal plants via five mechanisms: nutrient dilution, water stress, wildfires, snow depth, and phenology shifts. Ungulates may experience longer foraging time and reduced biomass due to less nutritious food resources. As a result, carnivores might benefit from increased stationary prey encounter and vulnerable individuals, but also need to cope with decreased prey biomass and increased energetic expenditure in hunting. We recommend increasing research efforts on nutrient dilution of northern plants, range shifts in northern herbivores that might lead to competition among them, and overall impacts of climate change on wolves.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e00253,0
838,The effect of copper stress on inter-trophic relationships in a model tri-trophic food chain.,"Soil fertility and management are paramount in ensuring food security for the growing populations. The use of agri-chemical and products containing heavy metals inadvertently threaten both food security and the surrounding ecosystems from contamination, loss of productivity or ecosystem service. In the present study a series of experiments on the toxic and adaptive responses of wheat plants to copper-induced stress were conducted to establish the effects of different levels of Cu (0 – 200 mg kg -1) on growth, nutrient levels and the total plant proteins of wheat seedlings (Triticum aestivum) using pot experiments. A tri-trophic food chain soil → plant → herbivore → predator was established as plants were infested with grain aphids (Sitobion avenae) which were subsequently fed to predatory ladybirds (Adalia bipunctata). Multiple measurements were conducted which deduced that Cu was taken up from soil into the plant tissues accumulating in the shoot and ear. The rate of growth and flag leaf length were affected by levels of Cu in the soil but total plant mass and ear weights were not. Wheat shoots and ears were analysed for N (crude protein) P, K and it was found that the levels of Cu in soils affected the levels of protein in both the shoot and the ear while the levels of P and K remained unaffected. Total populations of aphid and aphid fecundity appeared to be unaffected by the Cu stress-induced plants and no significant relationships between levels of N in plant tissues or flag leaf length were found. Ladybirds also appeared to be unaffected by the levels of Cu in soils as consumption rate or change in mass between the treatments was not significant. While the present study does not support a critical threshold for Cu levels in agricultural soils it can conclude that biological control methods are unaffected by levels of Cu in the soil.",,0
839,"Across-trophic variation of potassium, calcium and magnesium stoichiometric traits in a parasitism food chain across temperate and subtropical biomes","Potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) are three macro-elements essential for plants and animals. The ratios K : Mg or K : (Ca + Mg) are viewed as indices of physiological status in livestock animals. In plants, Ca, Mg and K concentrations can vary with climate in terrestrial ecosystems. Here, with a widespread tree species (Chinese cork oak, Quercus variabilis Blume) and an acorn predator (the weevil Curculio davidi Fairmaire), we investigate how K, Ca and Mg vary in soils, plant tissues (leaves and acorns) and a consumer (herbivore insects) with climatic variables induced by latitude (LAT) across the temperate–subtropical areas of eastern China. Concentrations of K, Ca and Mg in soils, leaves, acorns and weevil larvae showed different degrees of variation across the study area, but only Mg concentration increased significantly with rising LAT across all four trophic levels, albeit with varying slopes. With rising mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP), soil Ca significantly decreased, as did leaf and acorn K concentrations, whereas all four tropic levels showed significant decreases in Mg content with both MAT and MAP (P &lt; 0.05–0.001). Leaf and acorn Ca : Mg showed significant relationships with LAT and MAT (P &lt; 0.05–0.01). The K : (Mg + Ca) ratio in soils and weevil larvae increased linearly with MAP (P &lt; 0.05), and acorn K : (Mg + Ca) ratio varied in a concave manner (P &lt; 0.001). Our results suggest that variations of Ca, Mg and K in plant tissues and weevil larva across a study area of 20° LAT range were largely driven by climatic factors, and that Mg concentration changes in all four trophic levels with climate (and LAT) largely drive changes in soil, plant and consumer ratios between Mg, Ca and/or K. These results provide information on possible effects of climate change on nutrient dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1071/cp15090,0
840,"Uptake and trophic changes in polybrominated diphenyl ethers in the benthic marine food chain in southwestern British Columbia, Canada","We examined the physical and geochemical effects of sediment on the uptake of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) into marine sediment feeders and their transfer to higher trophic fauna. Sediment PBDEs increased with % total organic carbon (%TOC), organic carbon (OC) flux and grain size (%fines). Tissue PBDE variance was best explained ( R 2 = 0.70) by sediment acid volatile sulfides (AVS), PBDEs, and organic lability and input, with the highest values near wastewater outfalls. Dry weight tissue/sediment PBDEs declined with increasing sediment PBDEs, resulting in tissue dilution (ratio &lt;1) at &gt;10 000 pg/g in harbours. Ratios also decreased with increasing %fines, resulting in regional differences. These patterns imply that high levels of fines and high sediment concentrations make PBDEs less bioavailable. Dry weight PBDEs increased &gt;100× between background deposit feeders and predators (polychaetes, crabs, bottom fish, seal), but lipid normalized PBDEs barely increased (&lt;1.3%), suggesting remarkably high uptake in low-lipid sediment feeders, and that PBDEs don’t accumulate at higher trophic levels, but lipid content does. Filter feeders had lower lipid-normalized PBDEs than deposit feeders, highlighting the importance of food resources in higher trophic fauna for bioaccumulation. The most profound congener change occurred with sediment uptake, with nona/deca-BDEs declining and tetra-hexa-BDEs increasing. Harbour sediment feeders had more deca-BDEs than other samples, suggesting PBDEs mostly pass unmodifed through them. Deca-BDEs persist patchily in all tissues, reflecting variable dependence on sediment/pelagic food.",https://doi.org/10.1139/facets-2018-0021,0
841,Influence of predator pursuit and prey evasion on synchrony in the metacommunity of a three-trophic-food chain,"Spatial synchrony can increase the risk of regional extinction and hence,shrink metapopu- lation persistence.Coupled patch model,based on a within-patch three trophic food chains model,is adopted to investigate the impact of predator pursuit and prey evasion on the spatial synchrony in the metacommunity framework.As populations occur in the context of larger communities,moving from a metapopulation to a metacommunity model framework is a natural extension.Considering a metacom- munity can modify the conclusion that prey evasion decreases the degree of metapopulation synchrony. We obtain a counter-intuitive result that the evasion of basal species in three trophic food chains does not protect itself,but enhances the degree of synchrony for all species and then increases the risk of extinction of each metapopulation.These results indicate that species interactions need to be considered when the effect of conservation measures on population synchrony,and ultimately persistence,is addressed.",,0
842,Trophic food chain transfer of radiocaesium from reindeer meat to the blowfly Calliphora vicina and the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis,"The role of insects in the transfer of radionuclides has received little attention, despite their key role in nutrient cycling within ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the trophic food chain transfer of radiocaesium (137Cs) from reindeer meat to the blowfly Calliphora vicina (Robineau-Desvoidy) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) and further from blowfly pupae to the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis (Walker) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae). Radiocaesium was transferred to blowfly larvae during their feeding stage, with the highest whole-organism to food source concentration ratios (CRwo-fs) being found in actively feeding third instar blowfly larvae, with CRwo-fs in the range of 0.68-0.90. CRwo-fs in blowfly larvae at later developmental stages (i.e., post-feeding stage, prepupal stage, pupal stage, and adult stage) were significantly lower, with CRwo-fs in adult flies in the range of 0.07-0.10. Modelling of the data indicated that >70 % of the radiocaesium present in third instar feeding stage larvae was removed exponentially with excreta prior to pupariation. Furthermore, on average 49 % of the radiocaesium activity concentration assimilated in the metamorphing blowfly pupa was retained in the pupal case after the adult blowfly had emerged. When blowfly pupae were parasitised by parasitoid wasps, a greater proportion of radiocaesium was retained in the parasitised pupal case, with only 2-3 % of the activity concentration in the meat being found in the wasps, providing further evidence to support that radiocaesium is biodiluted in insect food chains. Our results indicate that carcass decomposition driven by insects directly affects the fate of radiocaesium retained in vertebrate carcasses and we discuss these findings in connection to radiocaesium cycling and dispersion in terrestrial ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161558,0
843,Untangling the role of tri-trophic food chain model in sustaining quokka population,"The introduction of predators like red fox and dingoes in the 1930s took a big toll on the quokka population. This paper is mainly concerned with designing conservation policies for quokka population (an endangered species). For this purpose, we designed a reaction–diffusion tri-tropic food chain model consisting quokka and its two predators, red fox and dingoes. We have shown the global existence, non-negativity and uniform boundedness for the designed spatiotemporal model. Existence and stability analysis of the equilibrium points for the model is done. We applied the prevalent idea of basic reproduction number with its origin from epidemiology to the food chain model, to deduce a condition for extinction and persistence of predator population. Natural systems exhibit an amazing diversity of structures in both living and non-living systems. We found that in the presence of diffusion, the model has the potential of exhibiting Turing instability generating beautiful patterns. Numerical results reveal that quokka tends to avoid places resided by dingoes. Our research aims at finding a solution for the current quokka extinction problem by showing the effect of presence of alternative food for dingoes and prohibiting the external factor causing death of quokka population.",https://doi.org/10.1142/s1793524521500534,0
844,Effect of Organic Matter on the Trophic Transfer of Silver Nanoparticles in an Aquatic Food Chain,"The behavior and toxicity of nanoparticles (NPs) could be affected significantly by the ubiquitous natural organic matter (NOM) in aquatic environments. However, the influence of NOM on NPs along the food chain remains largely unknown. This study constructed bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli) –protozoa Tetrahymena thermophila (T. thermophila) to evaluate the influence of three typical NOM on the bioaccumulation, trophic transfer and toxicity of Ag NPs. Results demonstrated that NOM could reduce the toxicity of Ag NPs to E. coli and T. thermophila by different influence mechanisms (e.g., reduce Ag NPs accumulation or complex with Ag+) which related to the type of NOM and organisms. Moreover, Ag NPs can be transferred and biomagnified to T. thermophila via trophic transfer. Three kinds of NOM could significantly increase the TTF value of Ag NPs ranged from 1.34 to 2.87, which may be ascribed to NOM reducing the capacity for T. thermophila to excrete Ag as NOM could significantly change the form of Ag. These findings provide a novel insight into the impact of NOM on the ecological risk posed by Ag NPs through the food chain and emphasize the need to further understand the interactions between NPs and NOM in various ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4009605,0
845,A trophic chain as indicator of agricultural practice change in maize,"Earlier work had remarked on leafhopper Zyginidia scutellaris early colonization of maize stands and the correlation of their abundance with cumulative numbers of generalist predators, mainly Orius spp., in maize fields; and highlighted the potential use of these species as indicators of agricultural change in maize systems.

846,Food chain without giants: modelling the trophic impact of bowhead whaling on little auk populations in the Atlantic Arctic,"In the Atlantic Arctic, bowhead whales ( Balaena mysticetus ) were nearly exterminated by European whalers between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. The collapse of the East Greenland–Svalbard–Barents Sea population, from an estimated 50 000 to a few hundred individuals, drastically reduced predation on mesozooplankton. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this event strongly favoured the demography of the little auk ( Alle alle ), a zooplanktivorous feeder competitor of bowhead whales and the most abundant seabird in the Arctic. To estimate the effect of bowhead whaling on little auk abundance, we modelled the trophic niche overlap between the two species using deterministic simulations of mesozooplankton spatial distribution. We estimated that bowhead whaling could have led to a 70% increase in northeast Atlantic Arctic little auk populations, from 2.8 to 4.8 million breeding pairs. While corresponding to a major population increase, this is far less than predicted by previous studies. Our study illustrates how a trophic shift can result from the near extirpation of a marine megafauna species, and the methodological framework we developed opens up new opportunities for marine trophic modelling.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2024.1183,0
847,Fertilization impacts microbiomes along the grassland trophic chain,"Abstract Agricultural grasslands are often managed intensively, influencing soil properties and microbial communities. This can result in significant community changes and challenges to health and function at different levels along the trophic chain. This study investigates how fertilization affects microbial communities in grassland ecosystems in multiple connected trophic compartments. Shifts in microbial composition occurred in response to fertilization with effects being host-dependent and changes being more pronounced in belowground compartments. Strong interactions between trophic levels facilitated transmission of bacterial genera from soil and roots to higher trophic levels. Pig slurry- derived microbes were found in all compartments, but their low prevalence suggests an indirect effect of fertilisation, primarily due to changes in nutrient availability. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering both individual compartments and trophic interactions in ecosystems to fully understand the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on environmental and human health.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.06.627205,0
848,Polychlorinated Biphenyls Transfer along the Trophic Chain in Hydroecosystems of Armenia,"Background Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) belong to the group of wide-spread organic compounds characterized by high toxicity, persistence and ability of long-range transfer. During the long years of PCBs use in industry world-wide, their huge amounts penetrated into environment and were involved in xenobiotics circulation in different media. Once penetrating the environment PCBs bioaccumulate and circulate in different matrices penetrating organisms of animals and humans through the tropic chains. Aims Studies were performed to reveal the actual state of PCB-related pollution and PCB transfer in hydroecosystems of the Republic of Armenia. Methods Revealing, identification and quantitative determination of individual PCBs were performed with the help of capillary gas-chromatography using the internal standard method on the electron-capture detector. Samples were taken from Sevan Lake (water, biomedia, bottom sediment) and different regions of Armenia (soil). Results Analyses of environmental samples demonstrated that PCBs were revealed in 100% cases. Average PCBs content in water from Sevan Lake made 0.727 mcg/L, while the maximum level was 6.831 mcg/L. In biomedia the average level of PCBs was 0.530 mcg/g and the maximum content was 0.743 mcg/g. In bottom sediment PCBs amounted to 1360.521 mcg/kg; maximum: 2166.052 mcg/kg. In soil samples PCB average value made 101.942 mcg/kg; maximum: 434.980 mcg/kg. Conclusion Research results indicated that PCBs were found in all studied matrices; moreover, PCBs content in bottom sediment and soil samples was a few dozens higher than in biomedia and water samples. This is consistent with their bioaccumulation and transformation features. The process of PCBs accumulation in hydroecosystems occurs mostly intensive. Depositing in bottom sediment, PCB residues are involved into the substances turnover by detritophages. Different hydrobionts accumulate PCB from the water environment. .",https://doi.org/10.1289/isee.2013.p-1-22-19,0
849,Autochthonous and allochthonous organic matter in trophic chain of lake ecosystems,"This work presents analysis of mass–balance model simulating biotic flows of energy in pelagial of the large lakes of Russia (Ladoga, Onego, and Baikal) and small lake in northern part of the Karelia. The model had been developed on the basis of software package Stella and intended to predict an annual production of phytoplankton, bacterio plankton and consumers (non predatory and predatory zooplankton, planktivorous and piscivorous fishes). The input (independent) abiotic parameters of the model were latitude, mean lake depth, total phosphorus content and water color. The model analyzed an involvement of the autochthonous and allochthonous organic matter in the total energy flow through trophic chain. It was underlined that bacteria are important component of the planktonic community linking the dissolved organic matter (DOM) with organisms of the trophic chain. In high humic and oligotrophic boreal lakes the plankton respiration exceeds the primary production, therefore allochthonous DOM transformed to bacterial production replaces photosynthetic production in consumer feeding. The efficiency of bacterial growth (the ratio of bacterial production to consumed energy) depends on the ratio between autochthonous and allochthonous DOM. It had been shown that efficiency of bacterial growth in lakes with high primary production was higher than in oligotrophic waters with dominated allochthonous DOM. The author discussed different–type organic matter contribution to hydrobiont production depending on total phosphorus and humic matter content. Bacterioplankton consuming allochthonous DOM is additional energy source for zooplankton. For prediction of the total biological productivity it was recommended to take into account also production of heterotrophic bacterioplankton which is involved in utilization of allochthonous DOM.",https://doi.org/10.31610/trudyzin/2017.321.2.115,0

851,"Trophic transfer of PFAS potentially threatens vulnerable Saunders's gull (Larus saundersi) via the food chain in the coastal wetlands of the Yellow Sea, China","Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been extensively documented as posing significant health risks to human populations. However, there is a lack of research of their impact on endangered species, which significantly affects the effectiveness of conservation efforts and maintenance of these populations. In this study, we examined the levels of PFAS pollution in adults and juveniles of the vulnerable Saunders’s gull ( Larus saundersi ), along with their various food sources using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and Ecopath model. Long-chain PFAS, predominantly composed of perfluorooctanoic acid (accounting for 51.4% of the total), were identified as the main pollutants in the gull, its food, and the environment. Saunders’s gulls showed significant bioaccumulation and magnification of PFAS, with contamination levels significantly above those recorded in other species. Mean PFAS levels between juveniles (904.26 ng/g wet weight) and adults (407.40 ng/g wet weight) revealed a significant disparity, indicating that PFAS pollution may severely threaten these birds. Among the food sources analyzed, bivalves and polychaetes emerged as the primary contributors to PFAS contamination in Saunders’s gulls, with high transfer efficiency. The fundamental cause of PFAS pollution in benthic organisms and the gulls appears to be baseline environmental pollution, which was highly consistent across all examined pollutant types. Moreover, chemical plants close to breeding areas may cause severe environmental pollution, threatening organisms at various trophic levels through the food web. We suggest enhancing the pollution monitoring of important biological habitats for timely prediction and early warning of chemical risks. Additionally, ecological restoration of key habitats should be strengthened to ensure the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2024.1467022,0

853,Habitat complexity does not influence prey consumption in an experimental three-level trophic chain,"ABSTRACT Habitat complexity influences species diversity and regulates trophic interactions, mostly by increasing resource partitioning within habitats and providing refuge for prey. The influence of habitat complexity on more than two trophic levels is not well understood, mainly because behavioral modifications of prey and predator may influence the outcome of trophic interactions. Thus, we conducted a two-factor experiment with a three-level trophic chain: a piscivorous fish [Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus (Spix &amp; Agassiz 1829)], an invertivorous fish (Moenkhausia forestii Benine, Mariguela &amp; C. de Oliveira, 2009) and an aquatic macroinvertebrate (Chironomidae larvae). We measured prey consumption in low, intermediate and high habitat complexity, provided by submerged macrophyte densities, in the presence and the absence of the piscivore, intending to test the hypothesis that higher habitat complexities decrease predators foraging success in different trophic levels. We calculated the percentage of consumed prey in all treatment combinations. There was no significant effect of habitat complexity on prey consumption for neither the piscivorous nor the invertivorous fish, but a positive correlation was found between the percentages of consumed prey by both the piscivore and the invertivore. Observed modifications in the foraging behavior of the piscivore may have resulted in similar prey consumptions in low and high macrophyte densities. Moreover, more active M. forestii could have suffered a higher predation pressure by H. unitaeniatus, resulting in the positive correlation found. We conclude that behavior patterns in different habitat complexities possibly influenced predation rates in the three experimental trophic levels.",https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6832358,0
854,Trophic Chain Organochlorine Pesticide Contamination in a Highly Productive Upwelling Area in Southeastern Brazil,"Organochlorine pesticides (OCP) are legacy anthropogenic compounds known to persist for several years in the environment. The continuous use of some OCP, such as DDT, after restrictions in developing countries are cause of concern, due to their deleterious effects to marine life and humans. Studies assessing OCP contamination in coastal environments are still scarce in South America and there is a need to understand the impacts from trophic chain accumulation of these pollutants in marine life. In this study, we have assessed OCP levels in muscle and liver and estimated the biomagnification factor in several upwelling system trophic chain members, including fish, squid, and marine mammal from Southeastern Brazil. DDT degradation product DDE was the OCP detected in the highest concentrations in Franciscana dolphins (Pontoporia blainvillei), 86.4 ng·g−1 wet weight, and fish muscle and liver. In general, higher OCP levels were found in liver than in muscle, except for croaker. Biomagnification factors (BMF) of OCP in the top predator P. blainvillei and the carnivorous cutlass fish (Trichiurus lepturus) were on average between 0.2 and 1.8. Continued OCP monitoring in this region is warranted to better understand the distribution and fate of these compounds over time, with the goal to establish strategies for the conservation of local dolphin species and to assess human health risks from local coastal region populations.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20146343,0
855,Trophic Transfer of Perfluoroalkyl Acids in a Periphyton-Mayfly-Zebrafish Food Chain,"Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous contaminants in freshwater ecosystems. Many PFAS are incorporated into food webs, with potential effects on ecological and human health. However, PFAS incorporation into the base of aquatic food webs remains poorly understood. The goal of this study was to quantify the uptake and trophic transfer of both legacy and current use PFAS compounds using a simulated freshwater food chain in a lab setting. Natural periphytic biofilms were placed into trays containing equimolar binary aqueous PFAS mixtures at environmentally relevant concentrations for five days. Following the initial exposure period, newly hatched mayfly larvae were introduced into each tray to feed on periphyton for most of their larval development. The mature larvae were then fed to zebrafish. All water and biota samples contained detectable levels of the tested PFAS. All PFAS were more concentrated in periphyton than in water, and four of six PFAS were further concentrated in mayfly larvae relative to periphyton. PFDA was the most accumulative in all biota. PFAS concentrations in zebrafish were significantly correlated with those in larval mayflies. Assimilation efficiencies in zebrafish were high (&gt;70%) for all compounds. Bioaccumulation of PFAS in periphyton and mayflies was positively correlated with log KOW and number of carbons.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.04.09.647996,0
856,Changes in contaminant distributions with trophic level in a marine food chain study,"A laboratory study was designed to investigate the transfer of chlorinated organic contaminants from sediments to marine biota in a simplified marine food chain. Sediments collected from the Passaic River, NJ, which contained high concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), PCBs and chlorinated pesticides, were used as the contamination source. Polychaete worms (Nereis virens) were exposed to Passaic River sediment for 70 days to allow steady-state concentrations to be achieved and then these organisms were fed to a crustacean, the American lobster (Homarus americanus). Contaminant distributions were altered significantly as they passed from sediments to polychaetes and then to the lobster. PCDDs and PCDFs containing four or five chlorines were accumulated by the polychaetes and lobster; however, the highly chlorinated congeners were not accumulated. PCB patterns in lobsters indicated that these organisms metabolized many PCB congeners. Coplanar PCBs did not appear to be metabolized and therefore became enriched relative to total PCB levels in the lobsters. Lobsters also greatly altered the ratios of chlordane and DDT series compounds relative to those in the sediments and polychaetes.",,0
857,Trophic Transfer of Metal Nanoparticles in an Aquatic Food Chain Diminishes Their Toxicity Disparities,"Engineered nanoparticles (ENP) threaten aquatic ecosystems as they are increasingly released into the aquatic environment, which is the sink for most contaminants, throughout their life cycle. How the food web responds to ENPs or how they shape the food web remains unclear. Here, we report the environmental behavior and toxicity of four ENPs in an aquatic food chain, focusing on their uptake, depuration, and trophic transfer efficiency. While no bioaccumulation or biomagnification was observed, the properties and biotransformation of the ENPs significantly influenced their uptake and depuration rates in the Eubranchipus vernalis-Oryzias latipes food chain. We also highlight the impact of particle properties and exposure pathways on toxicity, revealing that oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial damage, contributing to cellular dysfunction in various tissues. Sulfidation and surface coating accumulation strongly diminish and converge the ENP toxicity to O. latipes in terms of ENP property disparity. For the first time, these findings suggest that the food chain strongly modulates aquatic toxicity based on the accumulation and transformation of different ENP components, which may shed light on the understanding of the environmental fate of ENPs.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c13148,0
858,Trophic transfer of mercury in marine food chains from the offshore waters of Changshan Archipelago,"Introduction Mercury (Hg) and its organic forms can accumulate in marine organisms, undergoing biomagnification as they transfer through food chains. However, the factors affecting such Hg biomagnification are not fully understood. Methods This study analyzed the biomagnification of total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in marine food chains represented by invertebrates and fish from the offshore waters of Changshan Archipelago, grouped into continuous trophic level (TL) ranges based on nitrogen stable isotopic analysis. Results Concentrations of THg and MeHg ranged from 4.8 ng/g to 115.4 ng/g and 1.8 ng/g to 47.3 ng/g in invertebrates, and from 3.7 ng/g to 102.1 ng/g and 0.5 ng/g to 67.6 ng/g in fish, with TL ranges for invertebrates and fish of 1.27–2.70 and 1.97–3.60, respectively. Hg concentration increased with increasing TLs in both fish and invertebrates. Combined with nitrogen stable isotopic analysis, trophic magnification factors (TMF) were 1.51 and 1.16 for THg and MeHg in fish, and 1.95 and 1.71 for THg and MeHg in invertebrates, respectively, indicating the biomagnification of THg and MeHg in the study area. Further analysis of Hg biomagnification showed higher TMF values of Hg in both invertebrate and fish groups with higher δ 13 C values, suggesting that food sources influenced Hg biomagnification in marine organisms. Discussion Food sources with lower δ 13 C values might reduce biomagnification efficiency of both THg and MeHg within marine fauna. These results aided understanding of Hg biomagnification in marine food chains and provided a reference for developing ways to harness Hg pollution.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2025.1566875,0
859,Eco-evolutionary feedback as a driver of periodic state shifts in tri-trophic food chains,"Abstract Eco-evolutionary feedback can result in periodic shifts with long intervals between alternative community states. Simulations using a linear food chain model, namely the resource-prey-predator system with prey evolution have shown such an ecologically unfeasible pattern of long-term dynamics. The alternative community states are characterized by stable internal equilibria and fast synchronized perturbations at the lower two trophic levels. This trait-mediated community shift was governed by the evolution of the anti-predator trait of prey and is referred to as “eco-evolutionary oscillation (EEO)”. The observed EEO was interpreted to be because of the interaction between community ecological dynamics and trait evolution. We further examined the effects of genetic variation on the trait-performance relationship on the global stability of the community. The rapid evolutionary rate with high genetic variance and the strong relationship between trait values and predator avoidance tended to stabilize eco-evolutionary dynamics and cause the EEO to vanish.",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1782620/v1,0
860,Per- and Polyfluorinated Alkyl Substances in an Urban Terrestrial Ecosystem and Trophic Magnification with a Food Chain Approach,"Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) were analysed in a high number of terrestrial samples of soil, earthworm, bird eggs and liver from mammals in an urban area in Norway from 2013 to 2020. PFOS and the long chained PFCA were the most dominating compounds in all samples, proving their ubiquitous distribution. PFOS data from the urban area were significantly higher than data from background areas which indicate that some of the species can be suitable as bioindicators for PFAS in an urban environment. Biomagnification calculations with a food chain approach for TMF and simple predator-prey BMF calculations revealed that PFOS, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFDoDA, PFTrDA, PFTeDA, and 8:2 FTS had TMF and BMF values above 1, indicating their potential to biomagnifying in terrestrial ecosystems.None of the avian species exceeded the proposed predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) for bird eggs of 1000 ng/g for PFOS, but earthworm and fieldfare egg had average concentrations above the Canadian and European thresholds in diet for avian wildlife and predators. For earthworms, 18 % of the samples exceeded the European threshold (33 ng/g ww) in prey for predators and for fieldfare eggs, 35 % of the samples were above the same threshold. None of the soil samples exceeded a proposed PNEC for soil living organisms of 373 ng/g dw.Free ranging urban rats were analysed for PFAS for the first time, evidencing a high potential for PFAS exposure and subsequently the high abundance of PFAS sources throughout the urban terrestrial environment. Efforts to identify, reduce and remediate urban PFAS emissions need to be intensified, to both protect the environmental and human health in urban settings.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4604701,0
861,Toxic effects of lead on the biochemical parameters of the hyacinth weevils neochetina eichornae through the trophic levels of food chain,"Abstract Lead accumulation as determined by Atomic Absorbtion Spectroscopy was found to be higher in the roots than in the aerial parts of the aquatic plant Eichhornia crassipes Mart (Solms). However, Pb accumulation in the leaves of the Eichhornia plants had more significant effects with respect to eco‐toxicological studies. The hyacinth weevils Neochetina eichhornae feeding on lead treated plants bioaccumulated about 5–10% of Pb through the trophic levels of food chain. Studies on the biochemical changes in these insects revealed a drastic decline in the protein content with an increase in the free amino acid pool. The higher activity of alanine and aspartate amino‐transferases implied their role in metal stress conditions. This study demonstrated the biotransfer of a toxic metal Pb from the aquatic environment to the insects via the trophic levels of food chain ‐ a unique model system for ecotoxicological studies.",https://doi.org/10.1080/10934529509376312,0

863,Application of marine organisms at multi-trophic level to study the integrated biological responses induced by microplastics through food-chain,"Microplastics (MPs, smaller than 5 mm) are ubiquitous and difficult to be degraded in environment. It is more easily to be ingested by the organism and cause a series of harms through the food chain. Based on the survey of MPs distribution in the intertidal zone along our coast and the development of fast MPs detection methods by using Hyperspectral image recognition, we use a typical marine food chain (microalgae-mussels-crabs) to investigate the trophic transfer and the relative toxic effects by environmental MPs. The polyethylene particles (10-45 &amp;#956;m) was selected as representative MPs to investigate the induced biological effects in microalgae, marine mussels and crabs, and the potential mechanisms under different exposure scenarios, including both water-born and trophic transfer exposure. The results showed that the algae could absorb on the surface of MPs, which not only damaged algal cells, but also changed surface characteristics of MPs to affect the feeding of mussels. In addition, MPs could be ingested and accumulated in the consumers with significant exposure concentration dependence and tissue specificity. Biomarkers from different levels in mussels and crabs showed that MPs could induce the increased ingestion rate, decreased lysosomal membrane stability, the changes of the activity of antioxidative responses. In addition, MPs indeed caused more serious stress responses in organisms at higher levels in food chain through the trophic transfer under the mechanism to balance the antioxidant defenses and metabolism system. To our best knowledge, this research is the first study to focus on trophic transfer induced biological responses by MPs in marine organisms. It provides an important research model and scientific basis for the future exploration of eco-toxic effect of environmental MPs.",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-4928,0

865,Trophic Transfer of Nanoplastics and Di(2-Ethylhexyl) Phthalate by a Food Chain (Chlorella Pyrenoidosa-Daphnia Magna-Micropterus Salmoides) Induced Disturbance of Lipid Metabolism in Fish,"Nanoplastics and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) are ubiquitous emerging contaminants that are transferred among organisms through food chain in the ecosystem. This study examined the trophic transfer of polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) and DEHP in a food chain including Chlorella pyrenoidosa, Daphnia magna and Micropterus salmoides (algae-crustacean-fish) and evaluated the associated lipid metabolism at a higher trophic level in fish. Our results showed that the PSNPs and DEHP accumulated in C. pyrenoidosa or D. magna were transferred to the M. salmoides by the food chain, of which the PSNPs and DEHP were not biomagnified, while the PSNPs were trophically amplified through trophic transfer. It suggested that more PSNPs were accumulated by higher level consumers in long food chains. Additionally, the trophic transfer of PSNPs and DEHP resulted in antioxidant response and histopathological damage in M. salmoides. Moreover, the lipid biochemical parameters and lipid metabolism related genes (fasn, hsl, cpt1a, atgl, apob, fabp1, lpl, cetp) of M. salmoides were significantly affected, which indicated disturbance of lipid metabolism. This study offers great insight into the transfer of contaminants by trophic transfer and their negative effects on organisms at higher trophic levels, which cause human exposure to MNPs and organic contaminants in the ecosystem.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4510710,0
866,Competition Between Butyrate Fermenters and Chain-Elongating Bacteria Limits the Efficiency of Medium-Chain Carboxylate Production,"Medium-chain carboxylates such as n-caproate and n-caprylate are valuable chemicals, which can be produced from renewable feedstock by anaerobic fermentation and lactate-based microbial chain elongation. Acidogenic microbiota involved in lactate-based chain elongation and their interplay with lactic acid bacteria have not been characterized in detail yet. Here, the metabolic and community dynamics were studied in a continuous bioreactor with xylan and lactate as sole carbon sources. Four succession stages were observed during 148 days of operation. After an adaptation period of 36 days, a relatively stable period of 28 days (stage I) was reached with n-butyrate, n-caproate and n-caprylate productivities of 7.2, 8.2 and 1.8 gCOD L-1 d-1, respectively. After a transition period, the process changed to another period (stage II), during which 46% more n-butyrate, 51% less n-caproate and 67% less n-caprylate were produced. Co-occurrence networks of species based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequences and correlations with process parameters were analyzed to infer ecological interactions and potential metabolic functions. Diverse functions including hydrolysis of xylan, primary fermentation of xylose to acids (e.g., to acetate by Syntrophococcus, to n-butyrate by Lachnospiraceae, and to lactate by Lactobacillus) and chain-elongation with lactate (by Ruminiclostridium 5 and Pseudoramibacter) were inferred from the metabolic network. In stage I, the sub-network characterized by strongest positive correlations was mainly related to the production of n-caproate and n-caprylate. Lactic acid bacteria of the genus Olsenella co-occurred with potentially chain-elongating bacteria of the genus Pseudoramibacter, and their abundance was positively correlated with n-caproate and n-caprylate concentrations. A new sub-network appeared in stage II, which was mainly related to n-butyrate production and revealed a network of different lactic acid bacteria (Bifidobacterium) and potential n-butyrate producers (Clostridium sensu stricto 12). The synergy effects between lactate-producing and lactate-consuming bacteria constitute a division of labor cooperation of mutual benefit. Besides cooperation, competition between different taxa determined the bacterial community assembly over the four succession stages in this resource-limited system. During long-term reactor operation under constant conditions, chain-elongating bacteria were outcompeted by butyrate-producing bacteria, leading to the increase of n-butyrate yield at the cost of medium-chain carboxylate yields in this closed model system.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00336,0
867,Species partitioning in a temperate mountain chain: Segregation by habitat vs. interspecific competition,"Abstract Disentangling the relative influence of the environment and biotic interactions in determining species coexistence patterns is a major challenge in ecology. The zonation occurring along elevation gradients, or at bioclimatic contact zones, offers a good opportunity to improve such understanding because the small scale at which the partitioning occurs facilitates inference based on experiments and ecological modelling. We studied the influence of abiotic gradients, habitat types, and interspecific competition in determining the spatial turnover between two pipit and two bunting species in NW Spain. We explored two independent lines of evidence to draw inference about the relative importance of environment and biotic interactions in driving range partitioning along elevation, latitude, and longitude. We combined occurrence data with environmental data to develop joint species distribution models (JSDM), in order to attribute co‐occurrence (or exclusion) to shared (or divergent) environmental responses and to interactions (attraction or exclusion). In the same region, we tested for interference competition by means of playback experiments in the contact zone. The JSDMs highlighted different responses for the two species pairs, although we did not find direct evidence of interspecific aggressiveness in our playback experiments. In pipits, partitioning was explained by divergent climate and habitat requirements and also by the negative correlations between species not explained by the environment. This significant residual correlation may reflect forms of competition others than direct interference, although we could not completely exclude the influence of unmeasured environmental predictors. When bunting species co‐occurred, it was because of shared habitat preferences, and a possible limitation to dispersal might cause their partitioning. Our results indicate that no single mechanism dominates in driving the distribution of our study species, but rather distributions are determined by the combination of many small forces including biotic and abiotic determinants of niche, whose relative strengths varied among species.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.2883,0
868,Duplex Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Reveals Competition Between <i>Erwinia amylovora</i> and <i>E. pyrifoliae</i> on Pear Blossoms,"Erwinia amylovora and E. pyrifoliae are the causative agents of fire blight and Asian pear blight, respectively. The pathogens are closely related, with overlapping host ranges. Data are unavailable on the current distribution of E. pyrifoliae and on the interaction between the two species when they are present together on the same host. In this study, a duplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol was developed to monitor the population dynamics of E. amylovora and E. pyrifoliae on the surface of Bartlett pear blossoms. Bacterial cells washed from blossoms were used directly as the PCR template without DNA extraction. Primers and a probe based on the E. amylovora levansucrase gene detected all E. amylovora strains. All E. pyrifoliae strains, including the Japanese Erwinia strains previously described as E. amylovora, were detected with a primer and probe combination based on the E. pyrifoliae hrpW gene. Disease development and severity were not significantly different in blossoms inoculated with individual Erwinia species or with a mixture of the two species. However, E. amylovora grew to greater population sizes than did E. pyrifoliae in both single species inoculations and in mixtures, suggesting that E. amylovora has a greater competitive fitness on Bartlett pear blossoms than E. pyrifoliae.",https://doi.org/10.1094/phyto-98-6-0673,0
869,Competition between protons and cadmium ions in the planktonic food chain leading to the phantom midge Chaoborus,"Cadmium concentrations in the phantom midge Chaoborus can be related to those of the free Cd ion, Cd2+, in lakewater provided that the competitive influence of H+ on Cd uptake sites is considered. Because this predator takes up its Cd from plankton, competition between H+ and Cd2+ ions could take place at several levels in the food chain to which this insect belongs. To identify at which trophic levels this occurs, we first measured H+-Cd−1 competition in the gut of a given Chaoborus species (Chaoborus americanus) by exposing it to constant Cd concentrations in water and food but at various ambient pH levels (4.5, 5.5, 6.5). There was no difference in the efficiency with which this predator assimilated Cd at the various pHs, suggesting that H+ swallowed by Chaoborus do not compete with Cd at uptake sites in its gut. pH-sensitive dyes showed that C. americanus is able to maintain its gut pH between 6.5 and 8.0, even when the pH of ambient water varies beyond this range (4.5-9.0). We then determined whether H+-Cd2+ competition is likely to take place on the prey of Chaoborus by measuring the importance of water as a Cd source for the calanoid copepod Diaptomus minutus. Copepods fed with Cd-rich green algae and exposed to either a high [Cd2+] (5 nmol L−1) or a low [Cd2+] (1.6 nmol L−1) accumulated a majority of their Cd from water, suggesting that H+ and Cd2+ ions are likely to compete at Cd uptake sites on these crustaceans. Last, we measured Cd accumulation by this copepod at various pHs. Copepods held at pH 4.8 accumulated less Cd than those at pH 5.5, suggesting that H+-Cd2+ competition occurs in this animal. A bioaccumulation model designed to take into account H+-Cd2+ competition was parameterized using our data for Cd accumulation by copepods at pH 4.8 and 5.5 and then used to predict measured responses at pH 6.4.",https://doi.org/10.4319/lo.2006.51.2.1013,0

Here, using a precise polyethylene derivative with the biphenyl moiety tethered on every ninth carbon ( P9,b), we demonstrated that an SCLCP could form a crystal (Cr) phase in addition to an Sm phase. Two opposing interrelations of main- and side-chains determined the molecular packings. While the side-chain inclined to be perpendicular to the main-chain in the Sm phase, they paralleled and coassembled in the Cr phase with an orthorhombic structure. The Sm phase of P9,b was new in SCLCPs. Within the mesogen sublayers, the biphenyls were tilted and had a type of two-dimensional positional order, making this Sm phase ordering higher than that of smectic C. The Sm phase was metastable and kinetically grew faster below its isotropic temperature. However, it could not convert to the stable Cr phase unless it transitioned into the melting state. Fantastically, P9,b rendered the lamellar crystal in the Cr phase. The lenticular lamellae resembled that found in linear polyethylene crystallized at low undercooling. Importantly, albeit having the large anisotropic pendants situated regularly in the backbone, P9,b could follow the principle of chain-folding crystallization. Download figure Download PowerPoint Introduction Typically, biological and synthetic materials are composed of different constituents that are integrated either chemically or physically, wherein the inherent competing interactions regulate the structures and dynamics, and thus, the eventual utilities.1 When calamitic mesogens are tethered to linear-chain molecules as pendants, the resultant side-chain liquid-crystalline polymers (SCLCPs) encounter two antagonistic interactions.2,3 Namely, the linear main-chain tends to be a three-dimensional (3D) random coil with maximal entropy; on the other hand, the mesogenic side-chains favor the anisotropic array with liquid-crystalline (LC) orders. The balance of these two aspects could lead to different LC phases, such as the nematic and smectic (Sm). Numerous SCLCPs are evidenced by having flexible spacers inserted between the calamitic mesogen and the backbone.2–4 Thus, parallel packing of the mesogens, which are usually aromatic, could occur, accompanied by the nanosegregation between the main- and side-chains, resulting in smectic layered structures with the aliphatic main-chains confined by the mesogen sublayers.5 It is noteworthy that SCLCP is not simply the ""backbone + mesogens."" After being grafted with side-chains, the main-chain, such as linear polyethylene (PE), likely to be flexible in its archetype, would have its physical properties changed conspicuously.6–9 Having been synthesized from vinyl monomers, the conventional SCLCPs have their mesogenic side-chains on every second carbon of the backbone. With such a high grafting density, the backbone is inevitably extended due to the remarkable steric hindrance arising from the densely arrayed side-chains.10–12 The chain conformation is dependent mainly on the grafting density.13–15 Advanced polymer chemistry endows the accurate placement of the branching points along the backbone; namely, one could precisely adjust the spacing between the two adjacent side-chains, and thus, the grafting density.16–25 Enlarged side-chain spacing would enable the recovery of at least part of the backbone flexibility of SCLCPs, thereby affording more possibilities of hierarchical self-organization.18,19,23,26–30 It has been demonstrated that, in addition to the coil conformation, when side-chain spacing is large enough, the backbones could even fold to form crystalline packing.23,26,28,29 Recently, we found that precisely placing mesogenic side-chain on every seventh carbon rather than every second carbon along the PE backbone, the SCLCP could present a crystal structure with an order much higher than smectic LCs.31 An important issue is the ability to control which ordered structures are probably selected in the transition pathways for the SCLCP with precise side-chain spacing and which packing mechanism would play a dominant role at the molecular level. Herein, we report that the competition between LC and lamellar crystals could happen in a precise PE derivative containing a side-chain of calamitic mesogen, denoted as P9,b in this study (Figure 1a). The biphenyl side-chain with a butoxy tail, which had a strong tendency to form smectic packing, was situated on every ninth carbon. Two contradictory interrelations of the main- and side-chains could be envisioned for P9,b: the side-chain was apt to (1) perpendicular and (2) parallel to the main-chain (Figures 1b and 1c).5,12 In P9,b, the roughly perpendicular conformation was associated with a new smectic LC phase (Sm), which had an order higher than the typical smectic C. In contrast, the parallel conformation led to a crystal (Cr) phase with an orthorhombic structure. Commensuration of the side-chain spacing and the mesogen length could be crucial for the synergistic array of main- and side-chains in the Cr phase, albeit metastable Sm phase could not convert to the Cr phase directly (Figure 1d) due to the thoroughly different side-chain orientations with respect to the backbone. The existence of Sm and Cr were controlled by transition kinetics (Figure 1e), and they were dependent on varying self-assembly mechanisms. Unprecedentedly, although from a chemical aspect, P9,b is a polymer belonging to SCLCP, it could grow lamellar crystals with lenticular shape, extending over a long period (LP; ∼20 nm), and showed crystallization characteristics of chain-folding.

Download figure Download PowerPoint Experimental Methods We employed acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization, followed by backbone hydrogenation to synthesize P9,b.17 The synthetic route ( Supporting Information Scheme S1) details and molecular characterization are provided in the Supporting Information. Owing to the condensation polymerization mechanism of ADMET, the crude polymer had a broad range of molecular weight (MW) distribution. To eliminate the effect of low MW species on the phase transition of P9,b, we performed MW fractionation by preparative gel permeation chromatography. We employed gel permeation chromatography, calibrated with polystyrene standards, to measure the number-average MW of the fractionated P9,b as 2.1 × 104 g mol−1 and a polydispersity of 1.48. Phase transition behavior of P9,b was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC; TA Q1000 with a mechanical refrigerator, New Castle, DE). To identify the Sm and Cr structures of P9,b, various diffraction experiments were conducted. One-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and grazing-incidence (GI) X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the samples were recorded by the Ganesha system (SAXSLAB, Boston, MA) equipped with a semiconductor detector (Pilatus 300 K; DECTRIS, Baden-Daettwil, Switzerland), using Cu Kα radiation as the X-ray source (Genix3D Cu ULD; Xenocs, Grenoble, France). To obtain a well-oriented thin-film sample for the GI-XRD experiment, a drop of 20 mg/mL toluene solution of P9,b was spin-cast onto the substrate of a silicon wafer. Electron diffraction (ED) was performed using a JEOL JEM-F200 transmission electron microscope (TEM; Tokyo, Japan). Single crystals of P9,b were first grown on a carbon-coated surface of a mica sheet and then transferred to the TEM copper grid. To inspect the crystalline lamellar morphology of P9,b, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was performed using the Ganesha system. We made direct observation of P9,b thin films spin-cast on a silicon wafer substrate using atomic force microscopy (AFM; Dimension Icon, Bruker Nano, Billerica, MA) at room temperature. PeakForce tapping mode was applied in the AFM experiments using SCANASYST-AIR probes (tip radius: ∼2 nm; spring 205 constant: ∼0.4 N/m; frequency: ∼70 kHz). The samples' textures and their temperature variations were examined using a polarized optical microscope (POM; Nikon LV100N, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Linkam THMSE600 hot stage. We calculated the relative electron-density distribution of the Sm phase based on the Fourier transform of the XRD data obtained experimentally. To simulate the molecular packing in the Cr phase, molecular mechanics simulation was performed using Materials Studio software package 8.0 (Accelrys Software Inc., San Diego, CA). A more detailed description of the experiments, calculation, and simulation could be found in the Supporting Information. Results and Discussion Phase transition behavior Phase transitions of P9,b were investigated by DSC. Figure 2a presents the DSC cooling and subsequent heating traces recorded at various scanning rates. Upon cooling, two nearby exothermic peaks, denoted as I and II, were observed, with peak II being the major one. Correspondingly, two endotherms (II′ and I′) could be identified during heating. The large (II′) peak occurred at 86 °C, with latent heat nearly identical to peak II. On the other hand, careful examination unveiled a broad and weak endothermic process (I′) ranging from 95 to 110 °C, which became more apparent as the heating rate was reduced. The phase transition of P9,b appeared enantiotropic; we assumed that the degree of ordering increased from I to II. However, while the onsets of II and II′ were relatively close to each other, the transition I occurred at the temperature remarkably lower than that of I′, namely, undercooling, indeed existed. Usually, the enantiotropic transition of LC polymers that happens in a cooling process follows an isotropic-LC-crystal sequence, wherein the first step has little undercooling because the transition between isotropic melt and LC is close to equilibrium.32 However, as indicated above, P9,b exhibited a different transition behavior. Furthermore, when the sample was heated slowly (i.e., at 2.5 °C/min), an exothermic process right after peak II′ was sensed, as indicated by the inset in Figure 2a, which resulted in the latent heat of I′ larger than that of I, suggesting recrystallization had occurred. Figure 2 | (a) DSC cooling and subsequent heating traces of P9,b recorded at different scan rates. The inset shows the enlarged DSC traces of the exothermic process during heating at 2.5 °C/min, wherein the dashed line indicates the baseline. (b) 1D XRD profiles recorded at room temperature of P9,b samples with different thermal treatments. (c and d) POM images were recorded after the samples were transferred from 120 to 80 and 90 °C, respectively. For (d), the isothermal time was 5 h. Download figure Download PowerPoint We inferred from the DSC results that the two transitions, I and II, would be independent and associated with two distinct self-assembly structures. To test the hypothesis, 1D XRD experiments were carried out for the P9,b samples with varying thermal histories at room temperature. The samples were subjected to either quenching or normal cooling from the isotropic melt state, which presented a strong and broad peak centered at q (= 4πsinθ/λ) of 14.22 nm−1 (d = 0.44 nm) and a relatively sharp one at q of 15.75 nm−1 (d = 0.40 nm), respectively (Figure 2b). In the low-angle region, a set of layer diffractions were detected with the first-order one at q = 2.28 nm−1, evidencing a layer period of 2.75 nm (Figure 2b). This indicated that the quenched or typically cooled P9,b formed the Sm phase. Conversely, a completely different diffraction profile was attained after P9,b was annealed above the peak temperature of II′ (86 °C). Figure 2b shows that the 90 °C-annealed sample presented multiple diffractions in both the low- and high-angle regions, signifying the Cr phase. The Sm and Cr phases of P9,b could also be evidenced using POM. Figures 2c and 2d depict the POM images obtained after P9,b, transferred from isotropic melt to 80 and 90 °C, respectively. Fan-shaped texture appeared immediately at 80 °C (Figure 2c). In contrast, during isothermal crystallization at 90 °C, spherulite-like crystals with strong birefringence grew gradually and eventually impinged together (Figure 2d and Supporting Information Figure S1). Both Sm and Cr textures could retain upon cooling down to room temperature. Under the POM, the birefringence of Sm disappeared when the temperature exceeded 86 °C ( Supporting Information Figure S2). For Cr, the birefringence started to fade away upon heating to ∼100 °C and vanished eventually at 110 °C ( Supporting Information Figure S3). The experimental results indicate that the peak temperature of II′ at 86 °C should be taken as the isotropic temperature (Ti) of the Sm phase. On the other hand, the temperature of the endotherm I′ is, in fact, the melting temperature (Tm) of the Cr phase. Above Ti, the Cr could grow without Sm interference. However, when the melted P9,b was cooled below Ti, Sm developed much faster than the Cr. Because the Ti was lower than Tm, the Sm phase was metastable compared with the Cr phase (Figure 1d). Nevertheless, the Sm phase did not relax spontaneously in the Cr phase at temperatures below Ti, evidenced by the XRD and POM results obtained at room temperature. These phase transition features of P9,b could be delineated using free energy diagrams and growth rate versus temperature, as shown in Figures 1d and 1e, respectively. We considered that the competition of Sm and Cr phases existing in P9,b was controlled by the transition kinetics. Phase structure identification We sought to further understand the unique phase behavior of P9,b by performing 2D XRD experiments to elucidate the molecular packing in the Sm and Cr phases. Shearing the sample at 95 °C, followed by quenching to room temperature, produced a highly oriented film of the Sm phase. With an X-ray incident beam oriented perpendicular to the shear direction, the 2D XRD pattern (Figure 3a and Supporting Information Figure S4) showed layer diffractions on the meridian (the shear direction) and high-angle diffraction of 0.40 nm on the equator. Interestingly, a large peak at 0.44 nm was tightly associated with the side-chain packing appearance in the quadrants, implying that the mesogens were tilted away from the layer normal. We presumed that the tilting manner was similar to that of the smectic I or crystal K phase identified in small molecules.33,34 Thus, the two diffractions at 0.44 and 0.40 nm could be indexed as (110) and (020), respectively, of a monoclinic unit cell with the c-axis along the side-chain. In this case, the tilt was toward the longer edge of the mesogen-packing array, and the monoclinic lattice parameters of the Sm could be determined to be a = 0.61 nm, b = 0.80 nm, c = 3.18 nm, and β = 120°. Note that the value of asinβ equaled 0.53 nm, which was identical to the parameter a determinant for the conventional crystal E phase of biphenyl mesogen,35 implying that there might exist a herringbone array in the Sm of P9,b. In this context, the Sm phase possessed an order higher than smectic C, with only short-range positional order within the layer. Nevertheless, we were aware that the diffraction at 0.44 nm was rather broad, reflecting that the correlation length along the (110) plane normal was not as long, and therefore, the P9,b molecules should still stay in the LC state. Figure 3 | 2D XRD patterns of sheared P9,b recorded at (a) 85 and (b) 95 °C upon heating. (c) GI-XRD pattern of P9,b thin film on the silicon wafer substrate after isothermal crystallization at 90 °C. The dashed arrow indicates the direction perpendicular to the substrate. (d) [001] zone ED pattern of a lamellar single crystal of P9,b. The inset shows the lamellar single crystal in the selected area of ED. Download figure Download PowerPoint We heated the oriented Sm sample stepwise and in situ recorded the 2D XRD patterns (Figures 3a and 3b and Supporting Information Figure S5). To ensure the high quality of diffraction pattern, at each selected temperature, the exposure time was 60 min. The Sm structure was retained until 85 °C (Figure 3a), afterward a ring pattern XRD showed up (Figure 3b). The ring pattern's integral intensity profile was identical to the powder XRD pattern of the Cr shown in Figure 2b. It was astonishing that during the stepwise heating, the original orientation (i.e., the layer normal parallel to the shear direction) of the Sm structure was completely lost. This outcome affirmed that the Sm and Cr of P9,b did not correlate with each other in terms of molecular packing. Furthermore, the thermal 2D XRD experiments confirmed that temperatures below Ti prolonged annealing, thereby hindering the Sm transfer to Cr. Since the Cr phase grew reluctantly, the shear-induced orientation would relax during the isothermal crystallization above Ti, so it was challenging to align the Cr phase mechanically. Fortunately, we found that thin-film crystallization, which could present the 1D confinement effect,36 could lead to flat-on lamellae of P9,b stacked on the solid substrate, suitable for GI-XRD measurement. The thin films were spin-cast on the silicon wafer surface, followed by isothermal melt crystallization. Figure 3c depicts the GI-XRD result obtained from the P9,b crystals grown at 90 °C. The diffraction geometry indicated an orthorhombic structure (Figure 3c and Supporting Information Table S1). Assuming the c-axis of the Cr structure was perpendicular to the substrate, the low-angle diffractions on the layer lines could be well indexed (Figure 3c). The three-strong high-angle diffractions observed in 1D XRD (Figures 2b and 3b) were the (211), (310), and (020) diffraction, respectively. In this case, the orthorhombic lattice of a Cr with a = 1.50 nm, b = 0.81 nm, and c = 2.19 nm was identified. The structure determination was confirmed by the selected area, ED, from a lamellar single crystal, as depicted in Figure 3d. With the electron beam perpendicular to the lamellar basal surface, the [001] zone diffraction showed apparent reciprocal lattice of (hk0) plane, with the parameters of a and b identical to the GI-XRD result. Molecular packing schemes The Sm and Cr phases of P9,b might have dramatically different molecular packings. As mentioned earlier, we presumed that they were associated with the various interrelations of main- and side-chains. For the Sm structure with a layer period thickness of 2.75 nm, we calculated the electron-density distribution along the smectic layer normal using the layer diffractions observed in XRD, which showed clearly a nanosegregation structure (Figure 4a and Supporting Information Figure S6). It is conceivable that the parallel packing of biphenyl moieties would result in the densest region, which could contribute to the major peak shown in the electron-density distribution. We noticed that the length of ∼0.9 nm of the 30°-tilted rod-like mesogen projected on the smectic layer normal (Figure 4b), and this dimension could be found as the bottom width of the major electron density peak indicated in Figure 4a. This coincidence suggested an interdigitated packing of the mesogens in the Sm of P9,b, as schematically shown in Figure 4b. The lower electron density regions on both sides of the major peak should be associated with the rest of the components of P9,b, wherein a minor electron density peak was observed. We considered that the minor peak corresponded to the location of the main-chains, including the ester groups. In this case, it could be concluded that the nanosegregation between the main- and side-chains led to the main-chains being highly compressed in a narrow space with ∼1 nm or even smaller thickness. Figure 4 | (a) 1D electron-density distribution along the smectic layer normal and (b) schematic of interdigitated and titled side-chain packing of P9,b in the Sm phase. To seek clarity, only the two methylene units on the backbone, which are adjacent to the side-chain, are shown in (b). (c and d) Molecular packing in the orthorhombic unit cell of the Cr phase viewed along b- and c-axes, respectively. In (d), the (110) and (1 1 ¯ 0) planes are indicated, showing the intersection angle of 56°. Color codes in (b–d): yellow, main-chain; red, oxygen; grey, spacer and tail; blue, biphenyl. Download figure Download PowerPoint Notably, the P9,b backbone possessed eight methylene units between the two adjacent side-chains (Figure 1a). To adapt to the confined space and submit to the biphenyl packing based on π–π interaction, the methylene segment had to be curled, and the P9,b main-chain became an oblate random coil. In this circumstance, the main-chain and biphenyl tended to be orthogonal with each other (Figure 1b). Compared with conventional SCLCPs based on vinyl monomer, P9,b possessed the seven more methylene units inserted in the backbone, which would demand more space. Tilting and interdigitation of the mesogens could provide an enlarged interfacial area for each side-chain, aiding the main-chain to be accommodated without overcrowding. Compared with the Sm phase, the chain conformation changed thoroughly when the P9,b molecules crystallized. We noticed that P9,b presented an XRD pattern with the same geometry and extinction rule as another precise side-chain LC PE ( P7, m; Supporting Information Figure S7a) we reported recently, which had a side-chain on every seventh carbon and contained methoxybiphenyl rather than butyloxybiphenyl as the mesogenic moiety.31 With the regular grafting structure, P7, m could form a crystalline phase based on coassembly of the main- and side-chains, presenting the 3D positional order. According to the XRD results, P9,b should have the same structure. We proposed that the main- and side-chains are parallel in the Cr structure. As shown in Figure 1c, P9,b could adopt a parallel conformation, realized by properly rotating the ester group and the flexible spacer on the side-chains. This spatial arrangement of the main- and side-chains led to the building block of the crystal structure. It is worth mentioning that the extended length of the repeating unit on the backbone matched well with the mesogen length, both of which were ∼1 nm. This commensuration could facilitate the main- and side-chains to search for a way of close packing. Based on density measurement, we determined that the unit cell of the Cr of P9,b contained four repeating units. As the c-axis of 2.19 nm approached the extended backbone length of two repeating units (2.26 nm), two chains could be seen in the unit cell. With the aid of molecular simulation, the possible molecular packing of P9,b in the Cr structure with the symmetry of Pnn2 was described (Figures 4c and 4d). The simulated XRD profile agreed quite well with the experimental data ( Supporting Information Figure S7b). Interestingly, it is apparent that in the crystal lattice, two biphenyl groups could form a ""pair"" based on π–π interaction. Meanwhile, the PE backbone threaded through the vacancy surrounded by four biphenyl ""pairs"" and paralleled with the biphenyl (Figure 4d). Apparently, such a packing scheme did not maximize the π–π interaction; nevertheless, it was compensated by lowering the energy when the PE backbone assumed nearly all-trans conformation. Due to the ester linkages, spacers, and tail groups could have a certain degree of rotational freedom, the Cr phase had some intrinsic disorders and should be better viewed as a soft crystal. Lamellar crystal morphology and crystallization behavior From a chemistry perspective, P9,b is a typical SCLCP. Of particular interest is what the crystal habits of P9,b will show up. The thin-film morphology was inspected using AFM. For comparison, we also examined the thin film of Sm phase on the silicon wafer substrate. After the spin-cast film was quenched from melting state to 80 °C, the AFM result showed that the substrate was covered by irregular entities, many of which were belt-like with a width of ∼50 nm (Figure 5a). GI-XRD experiment approved that these entities were the Sm domains of which the layer normal was inclined to be approximately perpendicular to the substrate ( Supporting Information Figure S8). Unexpectedly, thin-film crystallization of P9,b could result in a well-defined lamellar morphology. The crystallization temperature (Tc) was selected to be higher than Ti because below Ti, Sm grew so fast that it disturbed and even suppressed the crystallization of P9,b. AFM experiments unveiled the flat-on lamellae with lenticular shape (Figures 5b and 5c and Supporting Information Figure S9).37–40 The lamellar stack could be induced by screw dislocation. The ED and the corresponding TEM results indicated that the short and long axes of the lenticular lamella were along the a- and b-axes of the orthorhombic lattice, respectively (Figure 3d and the inset). Compared with that grown at 90 °C, the lamellae showed a larger axial ratio of b/a when the Tc was increased to 94 °C (Figures 5b and 5c). In some areas, the (110) planes could be identified at the lamellar growth tip (Figure 5d).40 This observation was highly reminiscent of linear PE single crystals, which were lenticular-shaped, grown from the melt state at low undercooling.37,39,40 Therefore, despite P9,b having a chemical structure",https://doi.org/10.31635/ccschem.021.202000614,0
871,MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF THREE SPECIES FOOD CHAIN WITH INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION AND HARVESTING ON PREDATOR,"This research develops a mathematical model of three species of food chains between prey, predator, and top predator by adding intraspecific competition and harvesting factors. Interaction between prey with predator and interaction between predator with top predator uses the functional response type II. Model formation begins with creating a diagram food chain of three species compartments. Then a nonlinear differential equation system is formed based on the compartment diagram. Based on this system four equilibrium points are obtained. Analysis of local stability at the equilibrium points by linearization shows that there is one unstable equilibrium point and three asymptotic stable local equilibrium points. Numerical simulations at equilibrium points show the same results as the results of the analysis. Then numerical simulations on several parameter variations show that intraspecific competition has little effect on population changes in predator and top predator.

872,The Optimal Competition Resolution Rule for a Controlled Binary Chain,"Исследуется динамическая система типа бинарной цепочки Буслаева. Система содержит $N$ контуров. На каждом контуре имеются две ячейки и одна частица. Для каждого контура имеется по одной общей точке, называмой узлом, с каждым из двух соседних контуров. В детерминированном варианте системы в любой дискретный момент времени каждая частица перемещается в другую ячейку, если нет задержки. Задержки обусловлены тем, что две частицы не могут проходить через узел одновременно. Если две частицы стремятся пересечь один и тот же узел, то перемещается только одна частица в соответствии с заданным правилом разрешения конкуренции. В стохастическом варианте частица стремится переместиться, если система находится в состоянии, соответствующем состоянию детерминированной системы, в котором частица перемещается. Эта попытка реализуется в соответствующей системе с вероятностью $1-\varepsilon,$ где $\varepsilon$~--- малая величина. Получено правило разрешения конкуренции, называемое правилом длинного кластера. Это правило переводит систему в такое состояние, что все частицы перемещаются без задержек в настоящий момент и в будущем (состояние свободного движения), причем система попадает в состояние движения за минимальное возможное время. Среднее число $v_i$ перемещений частицы $i$-го контура в единицу времени называется средней скоростью этой частицы, $i=1,\dots,N.$ В предположении, что $N=3,$ для стохастического варианта системы получены следующие результаты. Для правила длинного кластера получена следующая формула для средней скорости частиц: $v_1=v_2=v_3=1-2\varepsilon+o(\varepsilon)$ $(\varepsilon\to 0).$ Для левоприоритетного правила, в соответствии с которым при конкуренции приоритет имеет частица контура с меньшим номером, для средней скорости частиц получена следующая формула: $v_1=v_2=v_3=\frac{6}{7}+o(\sqrt{\varepsilon}).$",https://doi.org/10.46698/n5870-2157-0771-b,0
873,Essays on Supply Chains Facing Competition from Gray Markets,"Author(s): Iravani, Foad | Advisor(s): Ahmadi, Reza | Abstract: This dissertation comprises of three chapters. The first chapter describes the development and implementation of a hierarchical framework for organizing the process for producing tax software at a leading tax software company in the United States.Every year, companies that produce commercial tax preparation software struggle with thousands of state and federal changes to tax laws and forms. Three competitors dominate the market with its short selling season, and release delays slash profits. Tax authorities issue updates August-December, and all changes must be processed and incorporated before year end. Systematic resource allocation and process management are crucial yet problematic due to the volume and complexity of changes, brief production timeframe, and feedback loops for bug resolution. A leading tax software provider asked us to formulate systematic approaches for managing process flow and staffing development stages with the goal of releasing the new version on time at minimum cost. To that end, we develop deterministic models in chapter 1 that partition tax forms into dedicated groups and determine staffing levels. Partitioning tax forms into groups simplifies workflow management and staffing decisions. To provide a range of resource configurations, we develop two modeling approaches. Numerical experiments show that our models capture the salient features of the process and that our heuristics perform well. Implementing our models reduced company overtime hours by 31% and total resource costs by 13%.The second and third chapters of the dissertation focus on supply chains that face competition from gray markets. Manufacturers in many industries have been challenged with the resale of their products in unauthorized distribution channels. Also known as parallel importation, gray markets are primarily driven by price differentials. When manufacturers release their products in different markets, they choose the price in each market based on consumer purchase power, sensitivity to price changes, and the overall economic conditions. This practice of price discrimination enables manufacturers to take advantage of differences between markets and maximize profit. However, price discrimination can potentially lead to the emergence of gray markets. Gray marketers buy products in the markets with lower prices and import them to markets with higher prices to sell below manufacturer price, thereby undermining the pricing structure of manufacturers and damaging brand value. The rapid growth and implications of gray markets have made it imperative for companies react to the diversion of their products to gray markets properly and take gray markets into consideration when making important strategic decisions.Chapter 2 analyzes the impact of parallel importation on a price-setting manufacturer that serves two markets with uncertain demand and characterizes the appropriate policy that the manufacturer should adopt against parallel importation. We show that adjusting prices is more effective in controlling gray market activity than reducing product availability, and that parallel importation forces the manufacturer to reduce the price gap while demand uncertainty forces the manufacturer to lower prices. We illustrate that ignoring demand uncertainty can take a significant toll on the manufacturer's profit. Furthermore, we explore the impact of market conditions (such as market base, price sensitivity, and demand uncertainty) and product characteristics (such as fashion vs. commodity) on the manufacturer's policy. We also provide managerial insights about the value of strategic decision-making by comparing the optimal policy to the uniform pricing policy that has been adopted by some companies.Chapter 3 extends the Stackelberg game to analyze the role of providing service as a non-price mechanism in coping with parallel importation in a deterministic setting. We observe that the price and service competition leads to a Prisoner's Dilemma equilibrium: both players would be better off if the parallel importer does not offer service.We show that parallel importation forces the manufacturer to provide more service in both markets. Although the manufacturer achieves higher profits with providing service, the price gap may be higher or lower than when no service is provided. We find that a little service can go a long way; even if the contribution of service to total revenue in the absence of gray markets is not very large, the manufacturer can significantly increase total profits by providing service when facing gray market activities. Also, when consumers become indifferent between the manufacturer and the parallel importer, the manufacturer uses the service mechanism to differentiate herself from the parallel importer. However, when the parallel importer free rides on manufacturer service, the manufacturer provides lower service. We also consider the manufacturer's service policy towards customers who buy the product from the gray market, and show that the manufacturer may achieve higher profit by allowing more parallel imports and charging gray market customers a service fee.",,0

876,Personnel Shortage or Competition in the Labor Market among Retail Chains,"В статье рассмотрен актуальный вопрос дефицита трудовых ресурсов в сфере торговли. В основу исследования положены результаты экспертной оценки условий труда, предлагаемых соискателям вакансий в четырех крупных федеральных торговых сетей города Екатеринбурга. Результаты получены опытным путем, в качестве эксперимента по трудоустройству тайного кандидата. Выявлено, что на уровень текучести кадров в торговых сетях и остроту ситуации с подбором персонала влияет в значительной мере субъективная оценка соискателей работодателя, нежели равный уровень заработной платы, а также деформация условий труда. Результаты исследования могут быть полезны при проведении кадровой политики, а также формировании эффективной системы управления и удержания трудовых ресурсов торговых сетей. The article deals with the topical issue of the shortage of labor resources in the field of trade. The study is based on the results of an expert assessment of the proposed working conditions for job seekers of four large federal retail chains in the city of Yekaterinburg. The results were obtained empirically, as an experiment on the employment of a secret candidate. It was revealed that the level of staff turnover in retail chains and the acuteness of the situation with the selection of personnel are largely influenced by the subjective assessment of the applicants for the employer, rather than the equal level of wages, as well as the deformation of working conditions.

Each player of supply chain is aware not only of his own influence on the market demand, but of the fact that the quantities of all other players have an influence, too. Market demand and manufactures supply respond each other within the supply chain. A Cournot-Nash equilibrium of supply chain is reached if all players take the quantities of all the other players as given and optimize their own quantities with respect to these quantities.

879,Considering Recycling Investment Strategies Under Internal and External Competition in the Remanufacturing Supply Chain,"A vertical supply chain consisting of an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and a downstream retailer, faces internal competition between new and remanufactured products, along with external competition from a third party remanufacturer (3PR). These competitive forces not only affect the sales of different product types but also directly impact the recycling of used products, which in turn affects the production and sales of remanufactured products. Against this backdrop, this article investigates the impact of separate and cooperative recycling investments by the OEM and retailer on profits and the environment, by considering different Vertical structure (i.e., OEM as Stackelberg leader, retailer as Stackelberg leader, and Vertical Nash). Our findings indicate that cooperative investment is optimal when either the OEM or retailer is the Stackelberg leader, but neither party is willing to invest in recycling when they are in Vertical Nash. When the OEM is the Stackelberg leader, the environmental impact of the cooperative investment model always falls between the other two models' environmental impacts. Comparatively, when the retailer is the Stackelberg leader or in Vertical Nash, the environmental impact is the same across investment models. Further experiments reveal that the OEM, acting as the Stackelberg leader, and implementing the cooperative investment strategy, yields better economic and environmental benefits, but the sales prices of both new and remanufactured products are higher in this case. Our study provides some important managerial implications that can be utilized as strategic guidance for the remanufacturing industry.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4471656,0

882,"COST OF MUTUALISM: COMPETITION, TREE MORPHOLOGY, AND POLLEN PRODUCTION IN LIMBER PINE CLUSTERS","All aspects of a mutualism may not be optimal for the participating species. We examined possible consequences to limber pine (Pinus flexilis) from competition within reproductive multi-genet tree clusters, which come from multi-seed caches stored by Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana). Limber pine occurs in three different tree growth forms. We predicted that genets within the tree-cluster growth form would have both reduced radial growth rates and lower pollen-cone whorl production relative to single-trunk and multi-trunk growth forms. We tested these predictions with three populations in the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains (USA), using ANCOVA models. Genets in clusters had reduced diameters, but similar heights and lower pollen-cone whorl production relative to same-aged genets in the other growth forms. Because seeds stored in clusters represent potential direct fitness loss to parent trees in comparison to seeds stored singly, nutcracker caching behavior may be suboptimal for limber pine at late life-history stages, thus generating a ""cost of mutualism.""",https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[0324:comctm]2.0.co;2,0
883,The fundamental role of competition in the ecology and evolution of mutualisms,"Abstract Mutualisms are interspecific interactions that yield reciprocal benefits. Here, by adopting a consumer–resource perspective, we show how considering competition is necessary in order to understand the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of mutualism. We first review the ways in which competition shapes the ecology of mutualisms, using a graphical framework based on resource flows rather than net effects to highlight the opportunities for competition. We then describe the known mechanisms of competition and show how it is a critical driver of the evolutionary dynamics, persistence, and diversification of mutualism. We argue that empirical and theoretical research on the ecology and evolution of mutualisms will jointly progress by addressing four key points: (i) the existence and shape of physiological trade‐offs among cooperation, competition, and other life‐history and functional traits; (ii) the capacity for individuals to express conditional responses to variation in their mutualistic and competitive environment; (iii) the existence of heritable variation for mutualistic and competitive traits and their potentially conditional expression; and (iv) the structure of the network of consumer–resource interactions in which individuals are embedded.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2012.06552.x,0
884,Mutualism can mediate competition and promote coexistence,"Abstract Mutualistic interactions are not believed to promote coexistence of competitors because mutualisms produce positive feedbacks on abundances whereas coexistence requires negative feedbacks. Here we show that a mutualism between an anemonefish ( Amphiprion ) and its sea anemone host mediates the effect of asymmetrical competition for space between the anemonefish and another damselfish ( Dascyllus ) in a manner that fosters their coexistence. Amphiprion stimulates increases in host area, the shared resource, but social interactions cap the number of anemonefish to two adults per host. Space generated by the mutualism becomes differentially available to Dascyllus because the effectiveness of an anemonefish in excluding its competitor declines with increases in the area it defends. This alters Amphiprion 's ratio of per capita intra‐ to interspecific effects and thus facilitates coexistence of the fishes. This mechanism may be prevalent in nature, adding another major pathway by which mutualism can enhance diversity.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1461-0248.2003.00514.x,0

Available data for a wide variety of ecosystems are nearly all consistent with the predicted quantitative relationships among nitrogen flow rates and nitrogen fractions in plants, decomposers, and nonliving organic matter.

887,From competition to facilitation and mutualism: a general theory of the niche,"Abstract Niche Theory is a central framework in ecology based on the recognition that most interactions between organisms are indirect, mediated by the biotic and abiotic dynamical environment these organisms live in. Despite its potential generality, the theory still mostly focuses on how resource–consumer dynamics mediate competition in ecological communities. However, it is being increasingly recognized that positive interactions between organisms also play an important role in driving the structure and functioning of ecological communities, from plants to microbes. In this paper, we present a unified theory of the niche that applies to both positive and negative interactions between organisms, mediated by one or two environmental factors. We show that classical concepts such as niche differences and fundamental and realized niches can naturally be expanded to facilitative and mutualistic interactions. In addition, we introduce and formalize new general niche concepts that appear exclusively in the presence of positive interactions: (1) the Allee niche, a region of environmental conditions for which a species can persist but not invade from low densities and (2) niche facilitation, when the presence of a species expands the set of environmental conditions under which a second species can invade and/or persist. To show the broad applicability of this theory, we illustrate these concepts using a diverse set of theoretical examples, from bacteria feeding on an inhibiting substrate, to nitrogen‐fixing plants and the indirect mutualism between a plant and a carnivore species. In sum, our work shows how Niche Theory provides a natural framework for positive interactions in ecology, bringing a unified perspective and new conceptual tools to study ecological systems where these positive interactions occur.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecm.1458,0
888,Competition Mediating the Outcome of a Mutualism: Protective Services of Ants as a Limiting Resource for Membracids,"Although competition for mutualists is known to be an influential force in plant-animal interactions, its importance in animal-animal associations is largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that phloem-feeding membracids (Publilia modesta) compete intraspecifically for the protective services of an ant mutualist (Formica altipetens). By experimentally increasing membracid densities in the field, we observed three negative effects due to competition for ants: (1) a 45%-59% reduction in the number of ants tending membracid aggregations, (2) a 63% increase in the abundance of a predatory salticid spider (Pellenes sp.), and (3) a 59% reduction in the mean number of membracid nymphs per plant. In total, the loss of protective services due to competition for mutualists translated into a 92% decrease in the production of newly eclosed membracid adults. These findings provide the first experimental demonstration that animal species compete for mutualists. In addition, our work indicates that mutualisms can be strongly influenced by the local biotic neighborhoods in which they occur and thus may be far more variable than previously thought.",https://doi.org/10.1086/285256,0
889,Mutualism supports biodiversity when the direct competition is weak,"A key question of theoretical ecology is which properties of ecosystems favour their stability and help maintaining biodiversity. This question recently reconsidered mutualistic systems, generating intense controversy about the role of mutualistic interactions and their network architecture. Here we show analytically and verify with simulations that reducing the effective interspecific competition and the propagation of perturbations positively influences structural stability against environmental perturbations, enhancing persistence. Noteworthy, mutualism reduces the effective interspecific competition only when the direct interspecific competition is weaker than a critical value. This critical competition is in almost all cases larger in pollinator networks than in random networks with the same connectance. Highly connected mutualistic networks reduce the propagation of environmental perturbations, a mechanism reminiscent of MacArthur's proposal that ecosystem complexity enhances stability. Our analytic framework rationalizes previous contradictory results, and it gives valuable insight on the complex relationship between mutualism and biodiversity.",https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14326,0
890,Coupled Oscillations in Food Webs: Balancing Competition and Mutualism in Simple Ecological Models,"As in other oscillating systems, oscillations of consumer resource pairs in ecological systems may be coupled such that complex behavior results. The form of that coupling may determine the nature and extent of this behavior. Two biologically significant forms of coupling are here investigated: first, where consumers consume each other's resources (CR coupling, representing competition between the two consumers), and second, where the resources are in competition with one another (RR coupling, potentially representing indirect mutualism between the two consumers). Interestingly, CR coupling leads to in‐phase synchrony of the oscillations, whereas RR coupling leads to antiphase synchrony. With either form of coupling, if the coupling remains weak, synchronous behavior is generated in the two systems. At strong levels of coupling, when the two forms act simultaneously, a balance between competition and mutualism is generated, which is manifest differently at different levels of resource coupling.",https://doi.org/10.1086/420776,0

892,Antibiotics create a shift from mutualism to competition in human gut communities with a longer-lasting impact on fungi than bacteria,"Abstract Background Antibiotic treatment has a well-established detrimental effect on the gut bacterial composition, but effects on the fungal community are less clear. Bacteria in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract may limit fungal colonization and invasion. Antibiotic drugs targeting bacteria are therefore seen as an important risk factor for fungal infections and induced allergies. However, antibiotic effects on gut bacterial-fungal interactions, including disruption and resilience of fungal community compositions, were not investigated in humans. We analysed stool samples collected from 14 healthy human participants over 3 months following a 6-day antibiotic administration. We integrated data from shotgun metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, and fungal ITS2 sequencing. Results While the bacterial community recovered mostly over 3 months post treatment, the fungal community was shifted from mutualism at baseline to competition. Half of the bacterial-fungal interactions present before drug intervention had disappeared 3 months later. During treatment, fungal abundances were associated with the expression of bacterial genes with functions for cell growth and repair. By extending the metagenomic species approach, we revealed bacterial strains inhibiting the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans . We demonstrated in vitro how C . albicans pathogenicity and host cell damage might be controlled naturally in the human gut by bacterial metabolites such as propionate or 5-dodecenoate. Conclusions We demonstrated that antibacterial drugs have long-term influence on the human gut mycobiome. While bacterial communities recovered mostly 30-days post antibacterial treatment, the fungal community was shifted from mutualism towards competition.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-020-00899-6,0
893,Competition as a mechanism structuring mutualisms,"Summary Hutchinsonian niche theory posits that organisms have fundamental abiotic resource requirements from which they are limited by competition. Organisms also have fundamental biotic requirements, such as mutualists, for which they also might compete. We test this idea with a widespread ant–plant mutualism. Ant‐mediated seed dispersal (myrmecochory) in eastern North America involves a few ant species that can effectively disperse the seeds of many plant species. This imbalance suggests that ant‐dispersed plants (myrmecochores) might compete for ant dispersers. We hypothesized that, because larger seeds are more attractive to ants, myrmecochores might segregate the timing of seed release by size to relieve competition. Comparative literature analysis across plant species reveals that myrmecochore seed size increases with the fruiting season in a staggered pattern so that small‐ and large‐seeded co‐occurring species do not release seeds at the same time – a pattern not observed in plants using other dispersal modes. We then presented foraging ants with small and large seeds in field trials throughout the fruiting season to test whether the observed temporal segregation in myrmecochore seed size is consistent with plant competition for ant dispersers. Our results show that dispersal rates for smaller seeds increase across the growing season, but only in the absence of large seeds. Our combined literature and field data suggest that myrmecochores stagger fruiting by seed size so that small seeds are set earlier to avoid competition for dispersal mutualists with larger seeds. Synthesis . Ecological interactions are often treated as either positive or negative, but our data blur this distinction by revealing that a positive interaction (mutualism) might be structured by a negative interaction (competition). Moreover, the recognition of biotic resources as critical niche requirements blurs the classic dichotomy between the fundamental (abiotic) versus realized (biotic limited) niche.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12203,0
894,The joint influence of competition and mutualism on the biodiversity of mutualistic ecosystems,"In the past years, there have been many advances -but also many debates- around mutualistic communities, whose structural features appear to facilitate mutually beneficial interactions and increase biodiversity, under some given population dynamics. However, most approaches neglect the structure of inter-species competition by adopting a mean-field perspective that does not deal with competitive interactions properly. Here, we build up a multilayer network that naturally accounts for mutualism and competition and show, through a dynamical population model and numerical simulations, that there is an intricate relation between competition and mutualism. Specifically, the multilayer structure is coupled to a dynamical model in which the intra-guild competitive terms are weighted by the abundance of shared mutualistic relations. We find that mutualism does not have the same consequences on the evolution of specialist and generalist species, and that there is a non-trivial profile of biodiversity in the parameter space of competition and mutualism. Our findings emphasize how the simultaneous consideration of positive and negative interactions derived from the real networks is key to understand the delicate trade-off between topology and biodiversity in ecosystems and call for the need to incorporate more realistic interaction patterns when modeling the structural and dynamical stability of mutualistic systems.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-27498-8,0
895,Aerobic and facultative anaerobic Klebsiella pneumoniae strains establish mutual competition and jointly promote Musca domestica development,"Introduction The gut microenvironment in housefly harbors a rich and diverse microbial community which plays a crucial role in larval development. However, little is known about the impact of specific symbiotic bacteria on larval development as well as the composition of the indigenous gut microbiota of housefly. Methods In the present study, two novel strains were isolated from housefly larval gut, i.e., Klebsiella pneumoniae KX (aerobe) and K. pneumoniae KY (facultative anaerobe). Moreover, the bacteriophages KXP/KYP specific for strains KX and KY were used to analyse the effects of K. pneumoniae on larval development. Results Our results showed that dietary supplementation with K. pneumoniae KX and KY individually promoted housefly larval growth. However, no significant synergistic effect was observed when the two bacterial strains were administered in combination. In addition, using high-throughput sequencing, it was demonstrated that the abundance of Klebsiella increased whereas that of Provincia, Serratia and Morganella decreased when housefly larvae received supplementation with K. pneumoniae KX, KY or the KX-KY mixture. Moreover, when used combined, K. pneumoniae KX/KY inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas and Providencia. When the abundance of both bacterial strains simultaneously increased, a balance in total bacterial abundance was reached. Discussion Thus, it can be assumed that strains K. pneumoniae KX and KY maintain an equilibrium to facilitate their development in housefly gut, by establishing competition but also cooperation with each other to maintain the constant composition of gut bacteria in housefly larvae. Thus, our findings highlight the essential role of K. pneumoniae in regulating the composition of the gut microbiota in insects.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1102065,0
896,Interference Competition and High Temperatures Reduce the Virulence of Fig Wasps and Stabilize a Fig-Wasp Mutualism,"Fig trees are pollinated by fig wasps, which also oviposit in female flowers. The wasp larvae gall and eat developing seeds. Although fig trees benefit from allowing wasps to oviposit, because the wasp offspring disperse pollen, figs must prevent wasps from ovipositing in all flowers, or seed production would cease, and the mutualism would go extinct. In Ficus racemosa, we find that syconia (‘figs’) that have few foundresses (ovipositing wasps) are underexploited in the summer (few seeds, few galls, many empty ovules) and are overexploited in the winter (few seeds, many galls, few empty ovules). Conversely, syconia with many foundresses produce intermediate numbers of galls and seeds, regardless of season. We use experiments to explain these patterns, and thus, to explain how this mutualism is maintained. In the hot summer, wasps suffer short lifespans and therefore fail to oviposit in many flowers. In contrast, cooler temperatures in the winter permit longer wasp lifespans, which in turn allows most flowers to be exploited by the wasps. However, even in winter, only in syconia that happen to have few foundresses are most flowers turned into galls. In syconia with higher numbers of foundresses, interference competition reduces foundress lifespans, which reduces the proportion of flowers that are galled. We further show that syconia encourage the entry of multiple foundresses by delaying ostiole closure. Taken together, these factors allow fig trees to reduce galling in the wasp-benign winter and boost galling (and pollination) in the wasp-stressing summer. Interference competition has been shown to reduce virulence in pathogenic bacteria. Our results show that interference also maintains cooperation in a classic, cooperative symbiosis, thus linking theories of virulence and mutualism. More generally, our results reveal how frequency-dependent population regulation can occur in the fig-wasp mutualism, and how a host species can ‘set the rules of the game’ to ensure mutualistic behavior in its symbionts.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007802,0
897,Evolution of parental care driven by mutual reinforcement of parental food provisioning and sibling competition,"In mammals, altricial birds and some invertebrates, parents care for their offspring by providing them with food and protection until independence. Although parental food provisioning is often essential for offspring survival and growth, very little is known about the conditions favouring the evolutionary innovation of this key component of care. Here, we develop a mathematical model for the evolution of parental food provisioning. We find that this evolutionary innovation is favoured when the efficiency of parental food provisioning is high relative to the efficiency of offspring self-feeding and/or parental guarding. We also explore the coevolution between food provisioning and other components of parental care, as well as offspring behaviour. We find that the evolution of food provisioning prompts evolutionary changes in other components of care by allowing parents to choose safer nest sites, and that it promotes the evolution of sibling competition, which in turn further drives the evolution of parental food provisioning. This mutual reinforcement of parental care and sibling competition suggests that evolution of parental food provisioning should show a unidirectional trend from no parental food provisioning to full parental food provisioning.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2010.1171,0
898,Apparent Competition or Apparent Mutualism? Shared Predation When Populations Cycle,"We use simple mathematical models to explore the indirect interactions between two prey species that share a predator when all three species undergo population cycles. The results are compared to analogous findings for systems that reach a stable equilibrium point. It is common for removal of one prey from a cycling system to result in a decrease in the mean density of the remaining prey species, contrary to the usual logic of apparent competition. Even when apparent competition between prey exists, its magnitude is usually reduced by population cycles. This effect occurs when the predator has a concave-down relationship between prey abundance and its own per capita growth rate. Such relationships can occur because of a saturating functional or numerical response. We investigate how prey density dependence and the shape of the predator's functional and numerical responses affect the sign and magnitude of this indirect interaction between prey species. There may also be (+, −) interactions between prey that differ significantly in their susceptibility to the common predator.",https://doi.org/10.2307/176875,0

Apparent mutualism results when multiple prey species reduce predation risk for each other by altering a predator's functional response. Short-term apparent competition occurs when multiple prey species increase predation risks for each other through the numerical response, i.e. increasing the predator's birth rate, or aggregative response, i.e. attracting a higher density of predators. Our objectives in this study were to determine the aggregative response and 2-prey functional response of a predator and to examine indirect effects over a range of prey densities. We used the clam Macoma balthica and juvenile blue crabs Callinectes sapidus as prey for adult blue crabs. In laboratory experiments, we determined the single-prey functional responses of the crabs to each prey species and the 2-prey functional response. We combined the 2-prey functional response with the known blue crab aggregative response to clams to estimate field predation rates. Our model predicts that at low prey densities, clams and juvenile blue crabs exhibit apparent mutualism, whereas at high clam densities, this relation switches to short-term apparent competition. These unexpected results highlight the need to incorporate multiple aspects of predation at multiple scales when considering indirect effects.

900,Carbon allocation and competition maintain variation in plant root mutualisms,"Abstract Plants engage in multiple root symbioses that offer varying degrees of benefit. We asked how variation in partner quality persists using a resource‐ratio model of population growth. We considered the plant's ability to preferentially allocate carbon to mutualists and competition for plant carbon between mutualist and nonmutualist symbionts. We treated carbon as two nutritionally interchangeable, but temporally separated, resources—carbon allocated indiscriminately for the construction of the symbiosis, and carbon preferentially allocated to the mutualist after symbiosis establishment and assessment. This approach demonstrated that coexistence of mutualists and nonmutualists is possible when fidelity of the plant to the mutualist and the cost of mutualism mediate resource competition. Furthermore, it allowed us to trace symbiont population dynamics given varying degrees of carbon allocation. Specifically, coexistence occurs at intermediate levels of preferential allocation. Our findings are consistent with previous empirical studies as well the application of biological market theory to plantroot symbioses.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.4118,0
901,Apparent competition or apparent mutualism? An analysis of the influence of rose bush strip management on aphid population in wheat field,"Abstract: Apparent competition, mediated by a shared predator, plays a key role in conservation biological control. Appropriate agroecosystems management may favour this type of indirect interaction. In that context, our aim was to test the effect of rose bush [ Rosa rugosa (Thunb.)] strips on the building up of aphid populations and of their natural enemies in adjacent cereal habitats. Several aphid species are currently found on Rosa sp. including Metopolophium dirhodum (Walker) for which it is a primary host. Aphid predators and parasitoids may build their populations on the aphid population present on Rosa sp. and later on migrate to wheat field during the cereal aphid infestation. Moreover, the flowers of the rose bushes may provide a source of nectar and pollen to these natural enemies. Our experiment was conducted in three rose margin wheat plots with a strip of rose bushes of R. rugosa and three control plots. Plots were compared during 2 years (2003 and 2004). Aphid, parasitoid and predator densities were recorded from May to the harvest of wheat on rose bushes and in wheat. In 2003, the aphid densities were moderate but in 2004, the population of aphid was very high. Even if predator and parasitoids arrived earlier in rose margin field than in control ones, the presence of rose bushes did not influence the aphid population within the field. Metopolophium dirhodum did not seem to migrate from the rose bushes to wheat. The level of parasitism was weak in rose bushes and the natural enemy population was not different in rose margin wheat and in control plots. The causes of the lack of efficiency of this type of management are discussed as well as the high aphid population in wheat in 2004.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01157.x,0
902,Interference Competition for Mutualism between Ant Species Mediates Ant-Mealybug Associations,"Ant-hemipteran mutualism has been well documented, and many studies have reported the interference competition between ant species for the mutualism. However, little is known on how this interference competition impacts the reciprocally beneficial association. Previous studies demonstrated that the invasive mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis (Tinsley) has established close mutual relationship with the ghost ant Tapinoma melanocephalum (Fabricius). The sympatric ants, Paratrechina longicornis (Latreille) and Tetramorium bicarinatum (Nylander) were frequently observed to compete for nutrient honeydew produced by P. solenopsis with T. melanocephalum. Herein, we investigated the effects of interference competition between the ant species on the ant-mealybug interactions. Phenacoccus solenopsis benefited from the tending by T. melanocephalum and P. longicornis. Interference competition between T. melanocephalum and P. longicornis interrupted the mutualism, suppressed the trailing activity of both species, but negligibly influenced the parasitism of Aenasius bambawalei Hayat, a solitary endoparasitoid of P. solenopsis. Harmonia axyridis, a predator of P. solenopsis, showed a significant avoidance when encountering with T. melanocephalum or P. longicornis, but not T. bicarinatum. Ant workers showed higher aggressiveness and lower exploratory activity when T. melanocephalum encountered P. longicornis. However, competition between T. melanocephalum and T. bicarinatum seldom influenced the trailing and exploratory activity of T. melanocephalum. It is concluded that interference competition for mutualism between ant species can mediate ant-mealybug associations and the fitness of mealybug colony. Our results also demonstrate that the effects of interference competition between ant species on ant-mealybug mutualism are varied among ant species.",https://doi.org/10.3390/insects11020091,0
903,Competition hierarchies among ants and predation by birds jointly determine the strength of multi-species ant-aphid mutualisms,"Protection mutualisms often involve multiple species of protector that vary in quality as mutualists. Because protectors may compete for access to mutualists, concordance between competitive ability and degree of benefit will determine the overall strength of multi-species mutualisms. We compared the abilities of two similarly sized congener ants as competitors for, and mutualists of pine-feeding aphids, and how insectivorous birds affected each ant–aphid mutualism. Formica planipilis and F. podzolica were indistinguishable in forager abundance, but the former was 13-fold more abundant at competition baits and provided 11-fold more benefits to aphids. These results highlight how, in a single environment, a great ecological distance can exist between two congener ants of similar size. Insectivorous birds disrupted the two mutualisms to a similar extent, reducing aphid and ant abundance by 91% and 39% respectively. Nevertheless, birds had an important influence on the relative benefits of the two ants to aphids: where F. planipilis consistently benefited aphids, F. podzolica only did so in the absence of birds. Consequently, the presence of insectivorous birds and ant species identity jointly determined whether ant–aphid mutualisms occurred in pine canopies and the strength of such interactions. Our study highlights the inter-relatedness of competition, predation and mutualism, and how competition can serve to strengthen mutualism by filtering inferior mutualists.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.18163.x,0
904,"ECOLOGY OF ROCKY SUBTIDAL COMMUNITIES: THE ROLE OF MODIOLUS MODIOLUS (L) AND THE INFLUENCE OF DISTURBANCE, COMPETITION, AND MUTUALISM","This study presents an analysis of physical and biological processes regulating the structure of rocky subtidal communities off coastal New Hampshire and southern Maine, USA, with emphasis on the ecology of the horse mussel Modiolus modiolus (L.). Quantitative sampling and multivariate analysis revealed 3 communities: (1) Modiolus community; (2) 30 m community of species with highest densities outside mussel beds; (3) 8-18 m community of species with maximal densities outside mussel beds. Controlled field experiments, a natural grazing experiment, and long-term photographic monitoring (5 yrs) enabled patterns of Modiolus community structure to be related to the processes maintaining them. Bivalve, ophiuroid, and echinoid prey outside, but not inside, Modiolus beds were consumed by fish, crab, and lobster predators demonstrating that Modiolus beds provide a refuge from predation. The sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis was the most significant agent of biological disturbance; urchin aggregations overgrazed the 8 m benthos causing radical changes in species composition, dominance, species richness, and diversity outside mussel beds. Infaunal assemblages within Modiolus beds changed the least because mussel bed structure damped the impact of overgrazing. At exposed offshore sites, dense populations of Modiolus modiolus occurred at intermediate depths (11-18 m) but not at shallow depths (4-8 m) dominated by kelp (Laminaria digitata, Laminaria saccharina). Experiments indicated that chronic storm-generated disturbance caused massive dislodgement of mussels competitively overgrown by kelp, and could account for the scarcity of Modiolus at shallow depths. The hypothesis that by grazing kelp off mussels urchins decrease the risk of mussel dislodgement was tested by an urchin removal experiment. The removal of urchins from mussel beds led to exponential kelp recruitment, resulting in a 30-fold increase of mussel mortality (via kelp-induced dislodgement), compared to control beds with urchins. The Modiolus-Strongylocentrotus interaction is mutualistic, as mussels provide a refuge from predation for urchins. Thus, coexistence of kelp and mussel competitors is facilitated by mutualism. Patch recolonization experiments showed that kelps dominated all algal turf patches and 47% of mussel patches within 7 months. In contrast, Modiolus did not recover from simulated dislodgement disturbance, suggesting that the ability of kelps to bounce back from disturbance enhances their competitive superiority.",,0
905,Coexistence of coinvading species with mutualism and competition,"Abstract All interactions between multiple species invading together (coinvasion) must be accounted for to predict species coexistence patterns across space. Mutualisms, particularly, are known to influence species' population dynamics and their invasive ability (e.g., mycorrhizal fungi with partner plants). Yet, while modeling coinvasion, their role in mediating coexistence is overlooked. Here, we build a spatially explicit model of coinvasion of two competing plant species with a shared fungal mutualist to study how mutualism and competition interact to shape the local and regional coexistence of competitors. We observe four main results. First, mutualist presence generates regional coexistence between competitors even when local coexistence between them is impossible. Second, increasing partner mutualist dispersal leads to abrupt changes in competitor coexistence outcomes. Third, differences in mutualist partner dependence and competitive ability interact to produce a variety of local and regional coexistence outcomes. Fourth, asymmetry in the dispersal ability arising from dependence‐dispersal trade‐offs leads to greater exclusion of species less dependent on mutualist partners for growth. In toto, incorporating mutualism‐specific trait trade‐offs and dispersal asymmetries into coinvasion models offers new insights into regional coexistence and invasive species distributions.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.70039,0
906,The joint influence of competition and mutualism on the biodiversity of mutualistic ecosystems,"Relations among species in ecosystems can be represented by complex networks where both negative (competition) and positive (mutualism) interactions are concurrently present.

However, current approaches neglect the structure of inter-species competition by adopting a mean-field perspective that does not deal with competitive interactions properly. Here, we introduce a framework based on the concept of multilayer networks, which naturally accounts for both mutualism and competition.

This leads to a non-trivial profile of biodiversity in the parameter space of competition and mutualism. Our findings emphasize how the simultaneous consideration of positive and negative interactions can contribute to our understanding of the delicate trade-offs between topology and biodiversity in ecosystems and call for a reconsideration of previous findings in theoretical ecology, as they may affect the structural and dynamical stability of mutualistic systems.",,0

908,"Interactions between ammonia and nitrite oxidizing bacteria in co-cultures: Is there evidence for mutualism, commensalism, or competition?","Nitrification is a two-step environmental microbial process in the nitrogen cycle in which ammonia is oxidized to nitrate. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea oxidize ammonia to nitrite and nitrite is oxidized to nitrate by nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. These microorganisms, which likely act in concert in a microbial community, play critical roles in the movement of inorganic N in soils, sediments and waters and are essential to the balance of the nitrogen cycle. Anthropogenic activity has altered the balance of the nitrogen cycle through agriculture practices and organic waste byproducts. Through their influence on available N for plant growth, nitrifying microorganisms influence plant productivity for food and fiber production and the associated carbon sequestration. N Fertilizer production, primarily as ammonia, requires large inputs of natural gas and hydrogen. In croplands fertilized with ammonia-based fertilizers, nitrifiers contribute to the mobilization of this N by producing nitrate (NO3-), wasting the energy used in the production and application of ammonia-based fertilizer. The resulting nitrate is readily leached from these soils, oxidized to gaseous N oxides (greenhouse gases), and denitrified to N2 (which is no longer available as a plant N source). Still, ammonia oxidizers are beneficial in the treatment of wastewater and they also show potential to contribute to microbial bioremediation strategies for clean up of environments contaminated with chlorinated hydrocarbons. Mitigation of the negative effects and exploitation of the beneficial effects of nitrifiers will be facilitated by a systems-level understanding of the interactions of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria with the environment and with each other.",https://doi.org/10.2172/1375758,0
909,"Mutualism Destabilizes Communities, but Competition Pays the Price","Abstract A classic result in theoretical ecology states that an increase in the proportion of mutualistic interactions in unstructured ecological communities leads to a loss of stability to external perturbations. However, the fate and composition of the species that constitute an unstable ecology community following such perturbations remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we use an individual-based model to study the population dynamics of unstructured communities following external perturbations to population numbers. We find that while mutualistic interactions do indeed destabilize communities, the entire community is rarely wiped out following a perturbation. Instead, only a subset of the ecological community is driven to extinction, and the species that go extinct are more likely to be those engaged in a greater number of competitive interactions. Thus, the resultant community formed after a perturbation has a higher proportion of mutualistic interactions than the original community. We show that this result can be explained by studying the dynamics of the species engaged in the highest number of competitive interactions: After an external perturbation, those species that compete with such a ‘top competitor’ are more likely to go extinct than expected by chance alone, whereas those that are engaged in mutualistic interactions with such a species are less likely to go extinct than expected by chance alone. Our results provide a potential explanation for the ubiquity of mutualistic interactions in nature despite the known negative effects of mutualism on community stability.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.26.573354,0

912,When Does Mutualism Offer a Competitive Advantage? A Game-Theoretic Analysis of Host-Host Competition in Mutualism,"Abstract Plants due to their non-motile nature rely heavily on mutualistic interactions to obtain resources and carry out services. One key mutualism is the plant-microbial mutualism in which a plant trades away carbon to a microbial partner for nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous. Plants show much variation in the use of this partnership from the individual level to entire lineages depending upon ecological, evolutionary, and environmental context. We sought to determine how this context dependency could result in the promotion, exclusion, or coexistence of the microbial mutualism by seeing if and when the partnership provided a competitive advantage to the plant. To that end, we created a simple 2 × 2 evolutionary game in which plants could either be a mutualist and pair with a microbe or a non-mutualist and forgo the partnership. This model included nutrients freely available to the plant, nutrients obtained only through mutualism with microbes, the cost of producing roots, the cost of trade with microbes, and the size of the local competitive neighborhood. Not surprisingly, we found that mutualism could offer a competitive advantage if its net benefit was positive. Coexistence between strategies is possible though due to competition between mutualists over the microbially obtained nutrient. In addition, the greater the size of the local competitive neighborhood, the greater the region of coexistence but only at the expense of mutualist fixation (non-mutualist fixation was unaffected). Our model, though simple, shows that plants can gain a competitive advantage from using a mutualism depending upon the context and points to basic experiments that can be done to verify the results.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.13.452216,0
913,Competition within species determines the value of a mutualism between species,"Abstract Social interactions within species, and mutualisms between species are both well characterised, but their influence on each other is poorly understood. We determined how interactions among burying beetles Nicrophorus vespilloides influence the value of their interactions with the mite Poecilochirus carabi. Beetles transport these mites to carrion, upon which both species breed. We show that mites help beetles win intraspecific contests for this scarce resource: mites raise beetle body temperature, which enhances beetle competitive prowess. However, mites confer this benefit only upon smaller beetles, which are otherwise doomed by their size to lose contests for carrion. Larger beetles need no assistance to win a carcass and lose reproductive success when breeding alongside mites. We conclude that social interactions within species explain whether interactions with another species are mutualistic or parasitic.

We experimentally tested how competition and mutualism affected trait and plasticity evolution of pairwise communities of genetically modified brewer’s yeast. We quantified evolutionary changes in growth rate, resource use efficiency (RUE), and their plasticity in strains evolving alone, with a competitor, and with a mutualist. Compared to their ancestors, strains evolving alone had lower RUE and RUE plasticity. There was also an evolutionary tradeoff between changes in growth rate and RUE in strains evolving alone, suggesting selection for increased growth rate at the cost of efficiency. Strains evolving with a competitive partner had higher growth rates, slightly lower RUE, and a stronger tradeoff between growth rate and efficiency. In contrast, mutualism had opposite effects on trait evolution. Strains evolving with a mutualist had slightly lower growth rates, higher RUE, and a weak evolutionary tradeoff between growth rate and RUE. Despite their different effects on trait evolution, competition and mutualism had little effect on plasticity evolution for either trait, suggesting that abiotic factors could be more important than biotic factors in generating selection for plasticity.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0311674,0
915,GLOBAL BIFURCATIONS INDUCED BY LOCAL CHANGES IN HIERARCHICALLY ORGANIZED SYSTEMS: COMPETITION AND MUTUALISM,"We consider a hierarchically organized system which is divided into weakly coupled sub-systems. To each sub-system is associated a single global variable. We show that the dynamics of the hierarchically organized system can be described by sets of local equations describing the internal behavior of the sub-systems and also by a set of dynamical equations describing the global behavior of the whole system. These last equations depend upon the global variables and also upon intra-sub-systems equilibrium measures. We study how a sudden change inside one of the sub-systems is able to perturbate the stability of the solutions of the global equations, i.e. to induce a sudden change in the global behavior. We apply this general method to an ecological example of a coupled set of interacting species which can either compete or be in symbiosis. We show that a change in the average individual behavior of the animals can modify the competition between two species. Computer simulations are realized. Two competing species whose one was extincting can coexist after a change in the average individual behavior of the extincting species animals and can even become in symbiosis. This article shows that the whole evolution of the ecosystem cannot be considered only from a global point of view but, as a set of coupled processes of evolution at the individual, population and ecosystem levels of the hierarchical system.",https://doi.org/10.1080/03081079108935150,0
916,Faculty Opinions recommendation of The joint influence of competition and mutualism on the biodiversity of mutualistic ecosystems.,"In the past years, there have been many advances -but also many debates-around mutualistic communities, whose structural features appear to facilitate mutually beneficial interactions and increase biodiversity, under some given population dynamics.However, most approaches neglect the structure of inter-species competition by adopting a mean-field perspective that does not deal with competitive interactions properly.Here, we build up a multilayer network that naturally accounts for mutualism and competition and show, through a dynamical population model and numerical simulations, that there is an intricate relation between competition and mutualism.Specifically, the multilayer structure is coupled to a dynamical model in which the intra-guild competitive terms are weighted by the abundance of shared mutualistic relations.We find that mutualism does not have the same consequences on the evolution of specialist and generalist species, and that there is a non-trivial profile of biodiversity in the parameter space of competition and mutualism.Our findings emphasize how the simultaneous consideration of positive and negative interactions derived from the real networks is key to understand the delicate trade-off between topology and biodiversity in ecosystems and call for the need to incorporate more realistic interaction patterns when modeling the structural and dynamical stability of mutualistic systems.",https://doi.org/10.3410/f.733464729.793547270,0

918,"Sustained beneficial infections: priority effects, competition, and specialization drive patterns of association in intracellular mutualisms","Intracellular symbioses provide a useful system for exploring evolutionary and ecological forces that shape mutualistic partnerships. Within- and among-host competitiveness driven by different strategies that symbionts adopt as they transfer materials to the host across a sub-cellular membrane might explain patterns of host:symbiont association observed in natural systems. We tested the hypothesis that different translocation strategies employed by symbionts affect their ability to occupy host habitats using two distinct modeling approaches. The first involved constructing a deterministic, Lotka-Volterra-type model with two symbiont species competing for access to a single host. The model recovered expected behaviors of co-occupancy/coinfection as well as competitive exclusion. However, a specialization coefficient allowed advantages to accrue to one of the symbionts and permitted otherwise inferior competitors to displace superior competitors. The second approach involved developing and implementing a detailed, highly configurable, and realstic agent-based model (ABM), facilitating experimentation of multiple symbiont strategies in competition simultaneously. The ABM emphasizes bidirectional movement of materials between symbiont and host (e.g., photosynthate from algae to heterotrophic host). Competitive interactions between symbionts based on simple strategies led to exclusion of the inferior symbiont or co-occupancy of the host. As in the first model, inferior competitors could overtake superior competitors when “affinity” terms (i.e., specialization) were included in the model. Both models lay bare the importance of coevolutionary specialization as a selectively advantageous strategy, and they offer a new conceptual framework for interpreting the dynamic patterns observed in extant host and mutualist associations by challenging the idea of “host control” of outcomes, and identifying specific points where coevolutionary specialization might accrue.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2023.1221012,0
919,Data from: Density-dependent indirect effects: apparent mutualism and apparent competition coexist in a two-prey system,"A predator consuming multiple prey species usually causes indirect effects. Apparent mutualism results when multiple prey species reduce predation risk for each other by altering a predator’s functional response. Short-term apparent competition occurs when multiple prey species increase predation risks for each other through the numerical response, i.e. increasing the predator’s birth rate, or aggregative response, i.e. attracting a higher density of predators. Our objectives in this study were to determine the aggregative response and 2-prey functional response of a predator and to examine indirect effects over a range of prey densities. We used the clam Macoma balthica and juvenile blue crabs Callinectes sapidus as prey for adult blue crabs. In laboratory experiments, we determined the single-prey functional responses of the crabs to each prey species and the 2-prey functional response. We combined the 2-prey functional response with the known blue crab aggregative response to clams to estimate field predation rates. Our model predicts that at low prey densities, clams and juvenile blue crabs exhibit apparent mutual- ism, whereas at high clam densities, this relation switches to short-term apparent competition. These unexpected results highlight the need to incorporate multiple aspects of predation at multiple scales when considering indirect effects.",https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12780455,0
920,Host Age Structure Defines Interactions with Pathogens: Grandparent Effect under Collaboration and Virulent Mutualism under Competition,"Abstract Background Symbiotic relationships are ubiquitous in the biosphere. Inter-species symbiosis is impacted by intra-specific distinctions, in particular, those defined by the age structure of a population. Older individuals compete with younger individuals for resources despite being less likely to reproduce, diminishing the fitness of the population. Conversely, however, older individuals can support the reproduction of younger individuals, increasing the population fitness. Parasitic relationships are commonly age structured, typically, more adversely affecting older hosts. Results We employ mathematical modeling to explore the differential effects of collaborative or competitive host age structures on host-parasite relationships. A classical epidemiological compartment model is constructed with three disease states: susceptible, infected, and recovered. Each of these three states is partitioned into two compartments representing young, potentially reproductive, and old, post-reproductive, hosts, yielding 6 compartments in total. In order to describe competition and collaboration between old and young compartments, we model the reproductive success to depend on the fraction of young individuals in the population. Collaborative populations with relatively greater numbers of post-reproductive hosts enjoy greater reproductive success whereas in purely competitive populations, increase of the post-reproductive subpopulation reduces reproductive success. However, in competitive populations, virulent pathogens preferentially targeting old individuals can increase the population fitness. Conclusions We demonstrate that, in collaborative host populations, pathogens strictly impacting older, post-reproductive individuals can reduce population fitness even more than pathogens that directly impact younger, potentially reproductive individuals. In purely competitive populations, the reverse is observed, and we demonstrate that endemic, virulent pathogens can oxymoronically form a mutualistic relationship with the host, increasing the fitness of the host population. Applications to endangered species conservation and invasive species containment are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.16.504183,0

922,A Gain-of-Function Polymorphism Controlling Complex Traits and Fitness in Nature,"Identification of the causal genes that control complex trait variation remains challenging, limiting our appreciation of the evolutionary processes that influence polymorphisms in nature. We cloned a quantitative trait locus that controls plant defensive chemistry, damage by insect herbivores, survival, and reproduction in the natural environments where this polymorphism evolved. These ecological effects are driven by duplications in the BCMA (branched-chain methionine allocation) loci controlling this variation and by two selectively favored amino acid changes in the glucosinolate-biosynthetic cytochrome P450 proteins that they encode. These changes cause a gain of novel enzyme function, modulated by allelic differences in catalytic rate and gene copy number. Ecological interactions in diverse environments likely contribute to the widespread polymorphism of this biochemical function.",https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1221636,0
923,Resource competition and plant traits: a response to Craine <i>et al</i>. 2005,"Summary Resource competition theory incorporates the mechanisms that underlie consumer–resource interactions and the trade‐offs that constrain these mechanisms. Contrary to assertions by Craine, the concept of R* as the measure of resource reduction and the predictor of resource competition has not changed since it was proposed more than two decades ago. Resource reduction, as summarized in R*, is readily observed. Soil concentrations of nitrate and water are decreased by plant uptake, and are lowered to different levels by different species. Tests have shown R* theory to correctly predict competitive outcomes for a variety of organisms and ecosystems. Consumer‐resource mechanisms are a building block for theories that incorporate other trade‐offs faced by plants, such as those between competitive ability and dispersal. Numerous plant traits interactively determine R* in a manner predictable from trait‐based resource competition theory. The same traits shown by comparative research to be associated with plant dominance in low‐nutrient habitats give lower R* values, greater predicted competitive ability and greater predicted abundances in nutrient‐limited habitats. Plant ecology needs closer links between analytical theory, observations and experiments. Simple verbal theories can generate novel ideas but the logical implications of such scenarios are best explored using the rigorous logic of mathematics. Predictions of theory can then be tested via experiments and comparative studies.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2007.01201.x,0
924,Emergent Shapes of Trait-Based Competition Functions from Resource-Based Models: A Gaussian Is Not Normal in Plant Communities,"In community ecology, it is widely assumed that organisms with similar traits compete more intensely with one another for resources. This assumption is often encoded into theory and empirical tests via a unimodal competition function, which predicts that per capita competitive effect declines with separation in traits. Yet it remains unknown how well this function represents the true effect of traits on competitive outcomes, especially for long-lived plant communities, where lifetime fitness is difficult to estimate. Here, we evaluate the shape of competition functions embedded in two resource-based (RB) models, wherein plants compete for shared, essential resources. In the first RB model individuals compete for two essential nutrients, and in the second they compete for light in a size-based successional setting. We compared the shapes of the competition functions that emerged from interactions within these RB models to the unimodal function and others shapes commonly applied. In few instances did the trait-based competition function emerging from the RB model even vaguely resemble any of the shapes previously used. The mismatch between these two approaches suggests that theory derived using fixed competition functions based on trait separation may not apply well to plant systems, where individuals compete for shared resources. The more promising path will be to model depletion of resources by populations in relation to their traits, with its consequences for fitness landscapes and competitive exclusion.",https://doi.org/10.1086/714868,0

Parasitic phorid flies limit competitive-dominant ant activity, potentially meditating competitive interactions between ant species, changing competitive hierarchies, or affecting ant communities. I considered interactions between phorids (Pseudacteon sp.), their ant host (Azteca instabilis F. Smith), and co-occurring ant species in coffee agro-ecosystems testing whether phorids (1) limit A. instabilis recruitment activity, (2) affect competitive interaction between ant species, and (3) are associated with other species' resource access and therefore have the potential to change competitive hierarchies. I monitored recruitment of A. instabilis and other ants to baits over 90 min on canopy trees with or without phorids. A. instabilis were one-half as abundant with phorids. Other species gained access to baits 12 times more often and were only able to take over baits when phorids were present. Furthermore, many more species (13 versus 2) gained access to resources when phorids were present. These results indicate that phorids mediate competitive interactions between ant species and may influence ant communities by affecting resource availability.

927,Variation in resource competition traits among <i>Microcystis</i> strains is affected by their microbiomes,"Abstract Freshwater harmful algal blooms are often dominated by Microcystis , a phylogenetically cohesive group of cyanobacteria marked by extensive genetic and physiological diversity. We have previously shown that this genetic diversity and the presence of a microbiome of heterotrophic bacteria influences competitive interactions with eukaryotic phytoplankton. In this study, we sought to explain these observations by characterizing Monod equation parameters for resource usage (maximum growth rate μ max , half‐saturation value for growth K s, and quota) as a function of N and P levels for four strains (NIES‐843, PCC 9701, PCC 7806 [WT], and PCC 7806 Δ mcyB ) in presence and absence of a microbiome derived from Microcystis isolated from Lake Erie. Results indicated limited differences in maximum growth rates but more pronounced differences in half‐saturation values among Microcystis strains. The largest impact of the microbiome was reducing the minimal nitrogen concentration sustaining growth and reducing half saturation values, with variable results depending on the Microcystis strain. Microcystis strains also differed from each other in their N and P quotas and the extent to which microbiome presence affected them. Our data highlight the importance of the microbiome in altering Microcystis ‐intrinsic traits, strain competitive hierarchies, and thus bloom dynamics. As quota, μ max , and K s are commonly used in models for harmful algal blooms, our data suggest that model improvement may be possible by incorporating genotype dependencies of resource‐use parameters.",https://doi.org/10.1002/mlf2.12094,0
928,Trait adaptation enhances species coexistence and reduces bistability in an intraguild predation module,"Disentangling how species coexist in an intraguild predation (IGP) module is a great step toward understanding biodiversity conservation in complex natural food webs. Trait variation enabling individual species to adjust to ambient conditions may facilitate coexistence. However, it is still unclear how coadaptation of all species within the IGP module, constrained by complex trophic interactions and trade-offs among species-specific traits, interactively affects species coexistence and population dynamics. We developed an adaptive IGP model allowing prey and predator species to mutually adjust their species-specific defensive and offensive strategies to each other. We investigated species persistence, the temporal variation of population dynamics, and the occurrence of bistability in IGP models without and with trait adaptation along a gradient of enrichment represented by carrying capacity of the basal prey for different widths and speeds of trait adaptation within each species. Results showed that trait adaptation within multiple species greatly enhanced the coexistence of all three species in the module. A larger width of trait adaptation facilitated species coexistence independent of the speed of trait adaptation at lower enrichment levels, while a sufficiently large and fast trait adaptation promoted species coexistence at higher enrichment levels. Within the oscillating regime, increasing the speed of trait adaptation reduced the temporal variability of biomasses of all species. Finally, species coadaptation strongly reduced the presence of bistability and promoted the attractor with all three species coexisting. These findings resolve the contradiction between the widespread occurrence of IGP in nature and the theoretical predictions that IGP should only occur under restricted conditions and lead to unstable population dynamics, which broadens the mechanisms presumably underlying the maintenance of IGP modules in nature. Generally, this study demonstrates a decisive role of mutual adaptation among complex trophic interactions, for enhancing interspecific diversity and stabilizing food web dynamics, arising, for example, from intraspecific diversity.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9749,0
929,"Intransitive competition is common across five major taxonomic groups and is driven by productivity, competitive rank and functional traits","Abstract Competition can be fully hierarchical or intransitive, and this degree of hierarchy is driven by multiple factors, including environmental conditions, the functional traits of the species involved or the topology of competition networks. Studies simultaneously analysing these drivers of competition hierarchy are rare. Additionally, organisms compete either directly or via interference competition for resources or space, within a local neighbourhood or across the habitat. Therefore, the drivers of competition could change accordingly and depend on the taxa studied. We performed the first multi‐taxon study on pairwise competition across major taxonomic groups, including experiments with vascular plants, mosses, saprobic fungi, aquatic protists and soil bacteria. We evaluated how general is competition intransitivity from the pairwise competition matrix including all species and also for each possible three‐species combination (triplets). We then examined which species were likely to engage in competitive loops and the effects of environmental conditions, competitive rank and functional traits on intransitive competition. We found some degree of competition intransitivity in all taxa studied, with 38% to 5% of triplets being intransitive. Variance in competitive rank between species and more fertile conditions strongly reduced intransitivity, with triplets composed of species differing widely in their competitive ranks much less likely to be intransitive. Including functional traits of the species involved more than doubled the variation explained compared to models including competitive rank only. Both trait means and variance within triplets affected the odds of them being intransitive. However, the traits responsible and the direction of trait effects varied widely between taxa, suggesting that traits can have a wide variety of effects on competition. Synthesis . We evaluated the drivers of competition across multiple taxa and showed that productivity and competitive rank are fundamental drivers of intransitivity. We also showed that not only the functional traits of each species, but also those of the accompanying species, determine competition intransitivity. Intransitive competition is common across multiple taxa but can dampen under fertile conditions or for those species with large variance in their competitive abilities. This provides a first step towards predicting the prevalence of intransitive competition in natural communities.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12959,0
930,"Species functional traits, trophic control and the ecosystem consequences of adaptive foraging in the middle of food chains","An ecosystem is often defined simply as a community of organisms interacting with each other and their biophysical environment. This definition arose from early conceptions of how the natural world is organized and is elegant in its simplicity because it captures the basic elements of a functioning system (Tansley 1935; Leopold 1939; Lindeman 1942). But those trying to develop a synthetic, empirical understanding of how ecosystems function and how they will respond to environmental change are abundantly aware that there is much inherent complexity implied by this seemingly simple definition. To cope with this complexity, ecologists have traditionally abstracted one part of the definition and elaborated the other. For example, ecosystem ecologists have long assumed that interacting organisms can be simply assigned to different compartments (e.g., producer, primary and secondary consumer, decomposer) and focused on environmental and biophysical aspects that dictate the transformation and flow of materials and energy among various compartments (Lindeman 1942; Odum 1969; Likens et al. 1970). In contrast, community ecologists have downplayed the biophysical aspects of materials and energy transfer and focused on organismal populations (Shelford 1913; Elton 1927; Hutchinson 1957; Paine 1966; MacArthur 1972), their diversity and the myriad interactions (e.g., predation, competition, facilitation) that determine their distribution and abundance (Reiners 1986; DeAngelis 1992).",https://doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511736551.022,0
931,"Across-trophic variation of potassium, calcium and magnesium stoichiometric traits in a parasitism food chain across temperate and subtropical biomes","Potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) are three macro-elements essential for plants and animals. The ratios K : Mg or K : (Ca + Mg) are viewed as indices of physiological status in livestock animals. In plants, Ca, Mg and K concentrations can vary with climate in terrestrial ecosystems. Here, with a widespread tree species (Chinese cork oak, Quercus variabilis Blume) and an acorn predator (the weevil Curculio davidi Fairmaire), we investigate how K, Ca and Mg vary in soils, plant tissues (leaves and acorns) and a consumer (herbivore insects) with climatic variables induced by latitude (LAT) across the temperate–subtropical areas of eastern China. Concentrations of K, Ca and Mg in soils, leaves, acorns and weevil larvae showed different degrees of variation across the study area, but only Mg concentration increased significantly with rising LAT across all four trophic levels, albeit with varying slopes. With rising mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP), soil Ca significantly decreased, as did leaf and acorn K concentrations, whereas all four tropic levels showed significant decreases in Mg content with both MAT and MAP (P &lt; 0.05–0.001). Leaf and acorn Ca : Mg showed significant relationships with LAT and MAT (P &lt; 0.05–0.01). The K : (Mg + Ca) ratio in soils and weevil larvae increased linearly with MAP (P &lt; 0.05), and acorn K : (Mg + Ca) ratio varied in a concave manner (P &lt; 0.001). Our results suggest that variations of Ca, Mg and K in plant tissues and weevil larva across a study area of 20° LAT range were largely driven by climatic factors, and that Mg concentration changes in all four trophic levels with climate (and LAT) largely drive changes in soil, plant and consumer ratios between Mg, Ca and/or K. These results provide information on possible effects of climate change on nutrient dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1071/cp15090,0

In contrast, mutualism had opposite effects on trait evolution. Strains evolving with a mutualist had slightly lower growth rates, higher RUE, and a weak evolutionary tradeoff between growth rate and RUE. Despite their different effects on trait evolution, competition and mutualism had little effect on plasticity evolution for either trait, suggesting that abiotic factors could be more important than biotic factors in generating selection for plasticity.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0311674,0
933,Evolution of a unique <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> chloroquine-resistance phenotype in association with <i>pfcrt</i> polymorphism in Papua New Guinea and South America,"The mechanistic basis for chloroquine resistance (CQR) in Plasmodium falciparum recently has been linked to the polymorphic gene pfcrt . Alleles associated with CQR in natural parasite isolates harbor threonine (T), as opposed to lysine (K) at amino acid 76. P. falciparum CQR strains of African and Southeast Asian origin carry pfcrt alleles encoding an amino acid haplotype of CVIET (residues 72–76), whereas most South American CQR strains studied carry an allele encoding an SVMNT haplotype; chloroquine-sensitive strains from malarious regions around the world carry a CVMNK haplotype. Upon investigating the origin of pfcrt alleles in Papua New Guinean (PNG) P. falciparum we found either the chloroquine-sensitive-associated CVMNK or CQR-associated SVMNT haplotypes previously seen in Brazilian isolates. Remarkably we did not find the CVIET haplotype observed in CQR strains from Southeast Asian regions more proximal to PNG. Further we found a previously undescribed CQR phenotype to be associated with the SVMNT haplotype from PNG and South America. This CQR phenotype is significantly less responsive to verapamil chemosensitization compared with the effect associated with the CVIET haplotype. Consistent with this, we observed that verapamil treatment of P. falciparum isolates carrying pfcrt SVMNT is associated with an attenuated increase in digestive vacuole pH relative to CVIET pfcrt -carrying isolates. These data suggest a key role for pH-dependent changes in hematin receptor concentration in the P. falciparum CQR mechanism. Our findings also suggest that P. falciparum CQR has arisen through multiple evolutionary pathways associated with pfcrt K76T.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.221440898,0

Parasitic phorid flies limit competitive-dominant ant activity, potentially meditating competitive interactions between ant species, changing competitive hierarchies, or affecting ant communities. I considered interactions between phorids (Pseudacteon sp.), their ant host (Azteca instabilis F. Smith), and co-occurring ant species in coffee agro-ecosystems testing whether phorids (1) limit A. instabilis recruitment activity, (2) affect competitive interaction between ant species, and (3) are associated with other species' resource access and therefore have the potential to change competitive hierarchies. I monitored recruitment of A. instabilis and other ants to baits over 90 min on canopy trees with or without phorids. A. instabilis were one-half as abundant with phorids. Other species gained access to baits 12 times more often and were only able to take over baits when phorids were present. Furthermore, many more species (13 versus 2) gained access to resources when phorids were present. These results indicate that phorids mediate competitive interactions between ant species and may influence ant communities by affecting resource availability. Considering that phorids limit A. instabilis attacks on herbivores and that ant species differ in effects on arthropod communities, phorids may have strong community-level effects in coffee agro-ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ee/34.5.1089,0
936,"Modification speed alters stability of ecological higher-order
  interaction networks","Higher-order interactions (HOIs) have the potential to greatly increase our understanding of ecological interaction networks beyond what is possible with established models that usually consider only pairwise interactions between organisms. While equilibrium values of such HOI-based models have been studied, the dynamics of these models and the stability of their equilibria remain underexplored. Here we present a novel investigation on the effect of the onset speed of a higher-order interaction. In particular, we study the stability of the equilibrium of all configurations of a three-species interaction network, including transitive as well as intransitive ones. We show that the HOI onset speed has a dramatic effect on the evolution and stability of the ecological network, with significant structural changes compared to commonly used HOI extensions or pairwise networks. Changes in the HOI onset speed from fast to slow can reverse the stability of the interaction network. The evolution of the system also affects the equilibrium that will be reached, influenced by the HOI onset speed. This implies that the HOI onset speed is an important determinant in the dynamics of ecological systems, and including it in models of ecological networks can improve our understanding thereof.",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2408.14209,0
