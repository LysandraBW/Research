The contribution of trait-mediated indirect effects to the net effects of a predator,"Many prey modify traits in response to predation risk and this modification of traits can influence the prey's resource acquisition rate. A predator thus can have a “nonlethal” impact on prey that can lead to indirect effects on other community members. Such indirect interactions are termed trait-mediated indirect interactions because they arise from a predator's influence on prey traits, rather than prey density. Because such nonlethal predator effects are immediate, can influence the entire prey population, and can occur over the entire prey lifetime, we argue that nonlethal predator effects are likely to contribute strongly to the net indirect effects of predators (i.e., nonlethal effects may be comparable in magnitude to those resulting from killing prey). This prediction was supported by an experiment in which the indirect effects of a larval dragonfly ( Anax sp.) predator on large bullfrog tadpoles ( Rana catesbeiana ), through nonlethal effects on competing small bullfrog tadpoles, were large relative to indirect effects caused by density reduction of the small tadpoles (the lethal effect). Treatments in which lethal and nonlethal effects of Anax were manipulated independently indicated that this result was robust for a large range of different combinations of lethal and nonlethal effects. Because many, if not most, prey modify traits in response to predators, our results suggest that the magnitude of interaction coefficients between two species may often be dynamically related to changes in other community members, and that many indirect effects previously attributed to the lethal effects of predators may instead be due to shifts in traits of surviving prey.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.071061998,0
HABITAT COMPLEXITY DISRUPTS PREDATOR–PREY INTERACTIONS BUT NOT THE TROPHIC CASCADE ON OYSTER REEFS,"Despite recognition of the significance of both food web interactions and habitat complexity in community dynamics, current ecological theory rarely couples these two processes. Experimental manipulations of the abundance of the two predators in an oyster-reef trophic cascade, and the structural complexity provided by reefs of living oysters, demonstrated that enhanced habitat complexity weakened the strengths of trophic interactions. The system of tri-trophic interactions included oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau) as the top predator that consumed the mud crab (Panopeus herbstii), which preys upon juvenile oysters (Crassostrea virginica). On reefs of low complexity, toadfish controlled mud crab abundances and indirectly determined the level of mortality of juvenile oysters. The indirect effects of toadfish on oysters emerged through their influence on how intensely mud crabs preyed on oysters. Augmentation of habitat complexity by substituting vertically oriented, living oysters for the flat shells of dead oysters disrupted both of the direct trophic linkages but did not alter the magnitude of the indirect effect of toadfish on juvenile oysters. This paradox can be understood by partitioning the mechanisms by which toadfish influence mud crabs and ultimately juvenile oysters. Trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs; i.e., predator-avoidance behavior in mud crabs) accounted for 95.6–98.2% of toadfish indirect benefits to oyster survival and, consequently, were a much greater contributor than density-mediated indirect interactions (DMIIs; i.e., the reduction in crab abundance by toadfish). Avoidance behavior was unaffected by modification in habitat complexity. Complex reefs increased total oyster survival because added habitat complexity reduced mud crab predation on oysters. Additionally, the magnitude of this effect was much greater than the increase in oyster mortality as a result of complex reefs disrupting toadfish predation on mud crabs. This experimental demonstration of how habitat complexity modifies trophic interactions in a temperate reef community has fundamental implications for our understanding of species interaction webs and community structure. The influence of habitat complexity on the strength of a trophic cascade generally may depend upon whether physical complexity provides actual and perceived refuges for component predator–prey pairs.",https://doi.org/10.1890/03-0067,0
Do plant‐ and soil‐mediated legacy effects impact future biotic interactions?,"Summary Biotic interactions of plants can have legacy effects mediated by changes in plant traits and soil characteristics. Legacy effects are defined as effects that persist after the causal biotic interaction ceases, because plant traits and soil characteristics are plastic and modifications may be maintained for long time periods. To date, studies on biotic interactions of plants with above‐ and below‐ground organisms and their plant‐mediated interactions have mainly focused on short‐term effects in the continuous presence of interacting organisms. Little is known about how long the changes in plant traits and soil characteristics persist after the biotic interaction ceases and indirectly affect future biotic interactions and community assembly. Further, since some organisms switch between above‐ and below‐ground compartments during ontogeny, impacts on soil‐dwelling larval stages can have direct legacy effects on their above‐ground adult stages and vice versa. Elucidating legacy effects of biotic interactions above and below the ground will provide a deeper insight into a better understanding of the importance of plant trait‐ and soil characteristic‐mediated indirect interactions in shaping community assembly, biodiversity and ecosystem function.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12456,0
HOW DEPENDENT ARE SPECIES-PAIR INTERACTION STRENGTHS ON OTHER SPECIES IN THE FOOD WEB?,"In ecological theory species interaction strengths are typically described by constants or functions that depend on the densities of the two interacting species. However, if species' traits (phenotypes) are plastic, then modifications in these traits (induced by the presence of another species) could affect interaction strengths of the focal species with a number of other species in the system. The magnitudes of such higher-order effects on interaction strengths have not been reported and are not straightforward to measure. We present a methodology to quantify changes in consumer–resource interaction coefficients (a metric of interaction strength) due to effects of predators on consumer (i.e., the prey of the predator) phenotype (e.g., nonlethal or trait-mediated effects). Application of this method to studies in diverse systems indicates that predators can strongly reduce consumer– resource interaction coefficients, often in the range of 20–80%. We use analytic and simulation models to show that effects on interaction coefficients of this magnitude can lead to trait-mediated effects that contribute more strongly than density-mediated effects to the net effects of predators on consumers and their resources, and even qualitatively change model predictions. Our results strengthen previous claims that trait-mediated effects strongly influence species interactions and suggest that recent calls to quantify interaction strengths must be broadened to include examination of the variation in interaction strengths due to their dependence on densities of other species (most notably predators) in food webs.",https://doi.org/10.1890/03-0662,0
A twin approach to unraveling epigenetics,"The regulation of gene expression plays a pivotal role in complex phenotypes, and epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation are essential to this process. The availability of next-generation sequencing technologies allows us to study epigenetic variation at an unprecedented level of resolution. Even so, our understanding of the underlying sources of epigenetic variability remains limited. Twin studies have played an essential role in estimating phenotypic heritability, and these now offer an opportunity to study epigenetic variation as a dynamic quantitative trait. High monozygotic twin discordance rates for common diseases suggest that unexplained environmental or epigenetic factors could be involved. Recent genome-wide epigenetic studies in disease-discordant monozygotic twins emphasize the power of this design to successfully identify epigenetic changes associated with complex traits. We describe how large-scale epigenetic studies of twins can improve our understanding of how genetic, environmental and stochastic factors impact upon epigenetics, and how such studies can provide a comprehensive understanding of how epigenetic variation affects complex traits.

We describe how large-scale epigenetic studies of twins can improve our understanding of how genetic, environmental and stochastic factors impact upon epigenetics, and how such studies can provide a comprehensive understanding of how epigenetic variation affects complex traits. The term epigenetics was originally introduced to describe how interactions between genetics and environment can give rise to phenotypes during development [1Waddington C.H. The epigenotype.Endeavour. 1942; 1: 18-20Crossref Google Scholar]. Epigenetics today more specifically defines cellular modifications that can be heritable, but appear unrelated to DNA sequence changes, and can be modified by environmental stimuli [2Holliday R. Epigenetics: an overview.Dev. Genet. 1994; 15: 453-457Crossref Google Scholar, 3Russo V.E.A. et al.Epigenetic Mechanisms of Gene Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1996Google Scholar]. At present, epigenetic mechanisms typically comprise DNA methylation and histone modifications, but also include many other mechanisms such as ATP-based chromatin-remodeling complexes, Polycomb–Trithorax protein complexes, non-coding RNA mediated gene-silencing, and potentially prions, transcription-factor binding, and other mechanisms involved in generating and maintaining heritable chromatin structure and attachment to the nuclear matrix. Epigenetic mechanisms play an essential functional role in complex organisms as regulators of transcription. Central to epigenetic regulation is the modulation of chromatin structure, whereby the majority of epigenetic processes impact upon chromatin organization and maintenance. Next-generation sequencing technologies have been developed to assay epigenetic changes (Box 1) in high-throughput approaches, and high-resolution genome-wide epigenetic profiles promise a more complete understanding of the functional impact of epigenetics. Of these processes, DNA methylation is the mechanism that has been studied in the greatest depth, and we therefore focus predominantly on this mechanism in this review.Box 1Next-generation sequencing technologies applied to epigeneticsThe availability of next-generation sequencing technologies has recently allowed the survey of genome-wide epigenetic variation at high resolution [8Bock C. et al.Quantitative comparison of genome-wide DNA methylation mapping technologies.Nat.

We describe some of these approaches briefly below. In addition, single-molecule sequencing technologies (e.g. [106Flusberg B.A. et al.Direct detection of DNA methylation during single-molecule, real-time sequencing.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar]) will probably reveal an even more complex and diverse layer of epigenetic mechanisms and modifications.DNA methylation(i)Bisulfite sequencing (Bi-seq) and reduced-representation Bi-seq (RRBS). These methods are based on bisulfite conversion of the DNA followed by sequencing. During bisulfite conversion, unmethylated cytosines are converted to uracils, whereas methylated cytosines remain unchanged, therefore complete bisulfite conversion is crucial to identifying correctly the unmethylated fraction of the genome. Bisulfite treatment cannot distinguish between methylated cytosines and 5-hydroxymethylated cytosines. Bisulfite-sequencing approaches survey DNA methylation across the entire genome (Bi-seq) or in a fraction of the genome (RRBS), which tends to be enriched for clusters of CpG dinucleotides.(ii)Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq), methylated DNA capture by affinity purification sequencing (MeCAP-seq), and methylated DNA binding domain sequencing (MBD-seq). These techniques are based on extraction of the methylated sections of the genome by antibody or protein binding, followed by immunoprecipitation and sequencing. In some of these technologies the CpG density of a DNA fragment will affect precipitation, but algorithms that take this into account have been developed [9Down T.A. et al.A Bayesian deconvolution strategy for immunoprecipitation-based DNA methylome analysis.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar]. One advantage of the MeDIP-seq approach is the option to design antibodies specific to methylated cytosines, thereby allowing the separate detection of methylated cytosines and 5-hydroxymethylated cytosines.(iii)Methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme sequencing (MRE-seq). This approach detects typically unmethylated DNA and involves DNA digestion with methyl-sensitive restriction enzymes, such as HpaII, Hin6I and AciI, to select unmethylated DNA restriction enzyme cut-sites, followed by sequencing.Histone modificationChromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is the standard approach used to detect histone-tail modifications.Non-coding RNAsLong non-coding RNAs can be detected using RNA-sequencing studies by selecting RNA transcripts that are not translated and are absent from protein databases, although the absence of protein products needs to be experimentally verified.

Epigenetic mechanisms are present in many taxa, but DNA methylation has been most extensively studied in mammals where it appears to be restricted to the cytosine base, and especially in the context of CpG dinucleotides. CpG dinucleotides are cytosine–phosphate–guanine sequences that typically cluster in genomic regions referred to as CpG islands (CGI), which are often located in gene promoters and exhibit low levels of DNA methylation. However, DNA methylation in mammals can also occur outside the CpG context, and this has been reported for example in embryonic stem cells [4Ramsahoye B.H. et al.Non-CpG methylation is prevalent in embryonic stem cells and may be mediated by DNA methyltransferase 3a.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5237-5242Crossref Scopus (439) Google Scholar]. Furthermore, although cytosine is typically methylated to 5-methylcytosine it can also be converted to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, which could also play an important epigenetic role [5Kriaucionis S. Heintz N. The nuclear DNA base 5-hydroxymethylcytosine is present in Purkinje neurons and the brain.Science. 2009; 324: 929-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar]. In mammals, DNA methylation is mediated by DNA methyltransferases that are responsible for de novo methylation and the maintenance of methylation patterns during replication [6Goll M.G. Bestor T.H. Eukaryotic cytosine methyltransferases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 481-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar], and also by DNA demethylases that remain largely unknown. There are several assays for genome-wide evaluation of DNA methylation patterns (Box 1), and methylation cross-technology comparisons have shown high concordance between different sequence-based methods [7Harris R.A. et al.Comparison of sequencing-based methods to profile DNA methylation and identification of monoallelic epigenetic modifications.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar] and slightly lower concordance between sequenced-based and microarray-based methods [8Bock C. et al.Quantitative comparison of genome-wide DNA methylation mapping technologies.Nat.

Phenotypic plasticity and the epigenetics of human disease.Nature. 2007; 447: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar]. Overall, patterns of negative correlation between promoter methylation and gene expression have been observed across multiple organisms and tissues [20Ball M.P. et al.Targeted and genome-scale strategies reveal gene-body methylation signatures in human cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 21Eckhardt F. et al.DNA methylation profiling of human chromosomes 6, 20 and 22.Nat.

Genet. 2009; 41: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar]. Furthermore, such negative correlations are more striking in CGI shores, defined as regions up to 2 kb outside of CGI borders, suggesting a functional role for these genomic regions in tissue differentiation and disease [27Irizarry R.A. et al.The human colon cancer methylome shows similar hypo- and hypermethylation at conserved tissue-specific CpG island shores.Nat.

Genet. 2009; 41: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar]. In addition, in genomic imprinting only one parent-of-origin copy of the gene is expressed, and the other is silenced via differential DNA methylation. For example, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at the human H19 locus control imprinting and gene expression at the maternally imprinted and transcriptionally-silenced insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2) locus and at the paternally imprinted and silenced H19 region [29Murrell A. et al.An association between variants in the IGF2 gene and Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome: interaction between genotype and epigenotype.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 247-255Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 30Murrell A. et al.Interaction between differentially methylated regions partitions the imprinted genes Igf2 and H19 into parent-specific chromatin loops.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar]. DNA methylation is also strongly correlated with other epigenetic changes, especially histone modifications, implicating shared mechanisms of epigenetic regulation and downstream effects [13Fuks F. DNA methylation and histone modifications: teaming up to silence genes.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 25Cedar H. Bergman Y.

Genet. 2011; 12: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar]. The possibility that transcriptionally silent chromatin could be a target for de novo DNA methylation has also been suggested (see [32Bird A. DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic memory.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar]). Altogether, multiple factors including DNA sequence, DNA methylation, histone modifications, and other epigenetic and transcriptional activity factors contribute to chromatin regulation, which in turn modulates transcription and affects mammalian development and disease (Figure 1). Studies of twins have been crucial to disentangling the contribution of genetic factors to numerous complex traits. Twin studies in epigenetics have the potential to address two important questions. First, to what extent are epigenetic changes heritable and how much variation is there in epigenetic heritability across the genome? Comparisons within and between twin-pairs can help to determine the extent of epigenetic heritability and stability. Second, do epigenetic factors contribute to complex phenotypes? Monozygotic (MZ) twins are traditionally regarded as genetically identical, therefore any phenotypic differences within MZ twin pairs are classically attributed to environmental factors. However, epigenetic variants can also associate with phenotypic differences, and the identification and interpretation of such associations is currently an important area of research. Epigenetic studies of disease-discordant MZ twins, who are completely matched for genetics, age, sex, cohort effects, maternal influences and common environment, and are closely matched for other environmental factors, should be considerably more powerful in detecting disease-related epigenetic differences than epigenetic studies of unrelated disease cases and controls with different life-histories. In the following sections we consider the value of twin studies in epigenetics and discuss recent findings highlighting the possibility that epigenetic variation can be transmitted through generations and impact upon common diseases. Heritability is the proportion of the phenotypic variance in the population that is attributed to genetic variation. Heritability estimates are traditionally obtained by comparing the extent of similarity between relatives in classical twin studies, twin-adoption studies, sib/half-sib studies, and transgenerational family studies. Each has weaknesses, but for most traits twin studies are generally regarded as the most reliable because they are unbiased by age effects and offer the ability to separate common environment from genetic effects [33MacGregor A.J. et al.Twins. Novel uses to study complex traits and genetic diseases.Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 131-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 34Visscher P.M. et al.Heritability in the genomics era – concepts and misconceptions.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar]. In twins, heritability estimates compare concordance rates or intra-class correlations in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins (Box 2). Twin comparisons of genome-wide epigenetic profiles can determine whether particular regions of the genome have higher epigenetic heritability estimates. In such regions, DNA methylation would appear to be influenced by genetic variation and DNA methylation variants would be relatively stable and could associate with genetic variants.Box 2Estimating genetic heritability using twin studiesHeritability refers to the proportion of the phenotypic variance in the population that is attributed to genetic variation, where genetic variants are represented either by additive genetic values (for narrow-sense heritability estimates, h2) or total genetic values (for broad-sense heritability estimates, H2). Twin heritability estimates usually refer to the narrow-sense heritability (h2), which is the proportion of the total phenotypic variance in the population that is attributable to additive genetic effects. Twin estimates of heritability compare phenotypic similarities in MZ and DZ twins, because MZ twins are genetically identical and share 100% of their germline sequence variation, whereas DZ twins are not genetically identical and share only on average 50% of germline sequence variants. In addition, MZ and DZ twins share the same uterus and birth date, and are exposed to very similar environmental factors in early development. In twins, h2 is typically calculated as twice the difference between MZ and DZ correlations,h2=2(rMZ−rDZ)where rMZ and rDZ are the correlations of the trait in MZ and DZ twins respectively. The advantage of the classical twin study is that it is possible to estimate and distinguish between the contributions of genetic, shared environmental, and unique environmental components to the phenotype. Heritability estimates are population-specific and, unless environmental factors remain constant, environment-specific. Interpreting heritability estimates should avoid common misconceptions [34Visscher P.M. et al.Heritability in the genomics era – concepts and misconceptions.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar]; for example, a large estimate of heritability does not necessarily r",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2010.12.005,0
