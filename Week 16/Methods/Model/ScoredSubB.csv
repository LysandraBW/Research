Phenotype Analysis of Human Cytochrome P450 2C9 Polymorphism Using a Panel of Fluorine-Substituted Benzo[h]quinolines as Inhibitors of Tolbutamide Hydroxylation,"To investigate the inhibitory effect of aza-polycyclic aromatic compounds on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 activity and analyze the fluorine-substitution effects on the CYP2C9 inhibition, benzo[h]quinoline (BhQ) and its fluorinated derivatives, 3-F-, 5-F-, 6-F-, 9-F-, 10-F-, 3,6-diF-, 5,6-diF-, 7,10-diF-BhQ, were subjected to analysis of their inhibitory effects on recombinant human CYP2C9.1-catalyzed tolbutamide hydroxylation. Although the inhibitory activity of BhQ itself on tolbutamide hydroxylation was not very strong (IC50 = 157 μ M), the inhibitory activities of BhQ derivatives on tolbutamide hydroxylation varied with the substituted fluorine positions. Their inhibitory activities decreased in the following order; (BhQ) > 7,10-diF ≥ 3,6-diF, 9-F ≥ 10-F > 6-F ≥ 5-F, 3-F ≥ 5,6-diF-BhQ. Moreover, the fluorine-substitution effect on the inhibition of tolbutamide hydroxylation catalyzed by wild-type CYP2C9 (CYP2C9.1) was different from the effects on the hydroxylation catalyzed by its polymorphic isozymes CYP2C9.2 and CYP2C9.3. The inhibitory activities of BhQs on tolbutamide hydroxylation by CYP2C9.2 decreased in the following order; 5-F ≥ 10-F, 9-F ≥ (BhQ) ≥ 7,10-diF > 6-F ≥ 5,6-diF, 3,6-diF > 3-F-BhQ, and those on the hydroxylation by CYP2C9.3 decreased in the follwing order; 7,10-diF, 10-F, (BhQ) ≥ 9-F, 5-F > 3-F ≥ 5,6-diF, 6-F, 3,6-diF-BhQ. The results thus showed that the position-specific substitution by fluorine atom(s) altered the CYP2C9 inhibition by BhQ derivatives in different manners depending on the polymorphic isozymes involved. These results suggest that inhibitory profiles obtained with fluorine-substituted analogs of the key inhibitor molecule may be useful as a new tool for phenotyping the polymorphic CYP isoforms.",https://doi.org/10.1248/jhs.52.821,0
Relationship Between Undergraduates’ Emotional Intelligence and Self-handicapping: With Personality Traits as the Mediator,"Objective: To investigate the relationship between undergraduates’ emotional intelligence, personality traits and self-handicapping. Methods: 1094 undergraduates were tested with Self-handicapping Questionnaires、Emotional Intelligence Scale and NEO-FFI. Results: ①Undergraduates’ self-handicapping was negatively correlated with emotional intelligence(P0.001). Personality traits played a role of absolute mediator in the relationship between undergraduates’ emotional intelligence and self-handicapping. Emotional intelligence affected self-handicapping indirectly by intermediary function of neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness. ② Undergraduates’ self -handicapping was positively correlated with neuroticism and negatively correlated with agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion as well as openness to experience (P0.001); neuroticism was the most powerful predictor (β=0.416). Conclusion: Personality traits play a role of mediator in the relationship between undergraduates’ emotional intelligence and self-handicapping.; different personality traits have different predictive effects on self-handicapping.",,0
Relationship between personality traits and emotional schema with loneliness in Iranian people with gender dysphoria: the mediating role of mindfulness,"Gender dysphoria affects people's social and psychological adjustment. One dimension of social incompatibility in people with gender dysphoria is the feeling of isolation and loneliness. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between personality traits and emotional schema with feelings of loneliness in Iranian people with gender dysphoria and the mediating role of mindfulness. Participants included 105 individuals with gender dysphoria who were asked to complete the UCLA Loneliness Scale-third version, Hexaco Personality Questionnaire, Leahy Emotional Schema Scale and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale. The results showed that emotionality, extraversion, and emotional schema have a significant relationship with loneliness (p < .05). Higher correlation has been found between loneliness and extraversion (r = –0.51). The direct effect of emotional schema (β = 0.17; p = .044) and mindfulness (β = −0.36; p < .001) on loneliness were significant. Furthermore, the mindfulness factor indirectly related extraversion and emotional schemas to loneliness. Thus, emotionality, extraversion and emotional schema probably reduce, directly and indirectly, the loneliness of people with gender dysphoria through the mindfulness as a mediating factor. It can be concluded that in clinical practice, therapeutic interventions based on mindfulness and schema-oriented can possibly reduce the feeling of loneliness of people with gender dysphoria.",https://doi.org/10.1080/14681994.2022.2139822,0

Polymorphism in PLIN Gene Intron 5 and its Association with Carcass and Fatness Traits in Chicken,"The genetic polymorphisms in perilipin(PLIN) gene were detected by PCR-RFLP method in five Shandong local chickens and one breeding strain including Jining Bairi chicken,Wenshang Luhua chicken et al,the correlations between the SNP loci and the carcass and fatness traits were analyzed.As a result,an G→T mutation of Pst Ⅰ restricton site at 2224 bp in PLIN gene was firstly identified in the six populations.Two genotypes(A1A1 and A1A2) were detected,and the allele A1 was predominant in all the six experimental populations.The statistical analysis showed that the 2224 bp polymorphism locus was not association with carcass and fatness traits(P0.05).The chickens with A1A1 genotype had higher carcass and fatness trait means than chickens with A1A2 genotype,but no significant difference was found between them(P0.05).The results of this research showed that the 2224 bp polymorphism locus in chicken PLIN wasn't an effective marker for carcass and fatness traits in chickens.",,0
The effect of A163G polymorphism in the osteoprotegerin gene on osteoporosis related traits in Slovak postmenopausal women,"Osteoprotegerin (OPG) plays an important role in the osteoclast differentiation as an effective inhibitor of osteoclast maturation and activation. We examined a potential effect of A163G single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of the OPG gene on femoral neck (FN-BMD) and lumbar spine BMD (LS-BMD), as well as circulating alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin (ALP, OC; formation markers), beta-CrossLaps (CTx; resorption marker) in Slovak postmenopausal women. In addition, fractures of spine, radius and femur were examined.Altogether 284 women (62.28 ± 8.40 years) were selected according to strict inclusion criteria. The polymorphism was detected by PCR-RFLP method. Genotype frequencies were tested using the chi-square test. The differences of quantitative variables between the genotypes were analyzed by covariance analysis (GLM procedure) after correction of the measurements for age and BMI. Fracture incidence in association with OPG genotype was evaluated by Binary Logistic Regression with the genotype, age, and BMI as covariates. The frequencies of genotypes were 76.8 %, 21.1 %, and 2.1 % for AA, AG, and GG, respectively. Statistically significant associations of OPG genotypes with FN-BMD (p < 0.01) and LS-BMD (p < 0.05) were observed. The GG genotype was associated with higher BMD values likewise decreased CTx concentration (p < 0.05) in compared with the other genotypes, which indicates that the allele G has a protective effect on bone. These associations were not followed by the effect of OPG on fracture incidence. Our results suggest that OPG/A163G polymorphism could contribute to the genetic regulation of BMD or bone turnover markers in Slovak population and thus could increase or decreased osteoporosis risk.",https://doi.org/10.1127/anthranz/2015/0494,0

Relationship of FASN Gene Polymorphism in Growth Performance and Wool Traits of Awassi Sheep,"Abstract The study was conducted in the sheep farm of the Al-Fayhaa station in the Jableh sub-district / Al-Musaib project (55 km south of Baghdad), as well as the Biotechnology Laboratory in the College of Agricultural Engineering Sciences / University of Baghdad for the period from 5/1/2022 to 30/10/2022. With the aim of detecting, the polymorphism in the FASN gene and its relationship to growth and wool production, as well as the Polymorphism distribution and allele frequency in 52 Awassi sheep and its lambs, three polymorphism appeared in this variant (G&gt;A SNP), which are GG, GA, and AA, and their percentage were 63.46, 32.69 and 3.85%, and the differences between them were highly significant (P≤0.01) with a frequency of 0.70 and 0.30 for alleles G and A, respectively. The results of the statistical analysis showed that the body weight of lambs at birth was significantly (P≤0.05) affected by the difference in the FASN gene polymorphism (G&gt;A SNP), and reached a maximum for lambs produced from mothers with a heterozygous genotype GA (4.22 kg) and then the mutant genotype AA (4.21 kg), The rate of weight gain between birth and weaning was also significantly affected by this variant of the FASN gene for wild-type GG (14.68 kg). It appeared that there was a significant variation (P≤0.05) in the fiber diameter of wool according to the FASN gene polymorphism (G&gt;A SNP). We can conclude by studying the genetic features in the FASN gene that they can be adopted in developing strategies for genetic improvement of sheep, and the application of the study to a larger sample and several sites and extracting the interaction between two SNPs would give more accurate results and determine the best method for managing and improving sheep flocks.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/1214/1/012032,0
FSHR gene polymorphism and its association to reproductive traits in Friesian Holstein cattle,"Abstract Follicle Stimulating Hormone Receptor (FSHR) is a receptor for FSH, a hormone that stimulates reproductive cells in both male and female animals. Polymorphisms in the FSHR gene may impair cattle reproduction performance, reducing reproductive efficiency. This study aims to look into FSHR genetic variation and how it affects reproductive performance in Friesian Holstein (FH) dairy cattle. A total of 26 blood samples were collected from female FH for DNA analysis, followed by data collection on reproductive traits such as postpartum mating (PPM; days), calving interval (CI; months), and services per conception (SC). Alu I was used as an enzyme restriction in PCR-RFLP to determine the FSHR genotype. The results show three genotypes: CG (highest frequency), CC, and GG, with Hardy-Weinberg analysis indicating that the population is in equilibrium. All reported reproductive traits showed no significant association with FSHR genotypes. Although not statistically significant, the GG genotype performs better in PPM and CI. Meanwhile, the CC genotype has the lowest SC among the genotypes. It is concluded that the FSHR gene may be used as a genetic marker in the reproduction performance of FH dairy cattle.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/1341/1/012023,0
Staying ‘In Sync’ with Others During COVID-19: Positivity Resonance Mediates Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Links between Trait Resilience and Mental Health,"Shared positive emotions involving caring and synchrony—termed “positivity resonance”—are associated with mental health (Major et al., 2018). We hypothesized that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, individual differences in trait resilience would be linked with better overall mental health in part because those higher in trait resilience experience more positivity resonance. We surveyed respondents nationally in April and May of 2020 (total N = 1,059), during pervasive stay-at-home orders. Participants completed self-reports of trait resilience and mental health and used the Day Reconstruction Method to describe their social and emotional experiences. Structural equation models showed positivity resonance to mediate the links between trait resilience and mental health outcomes. Subsequent analyses showed these mediating effects to be independent of overall positive emotion and social interaction quantity (amongst nationwide adults). These results indicate that high-quality social connection played a uniquely important role in maintaining mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.",https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/z934e,0
THE COEVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS OF ANTAGONISTIC INTERACTIONS MEDIATED BY QUANTITATIVE TRAITS WITH EVOLVING VARIANCES,"Quantitative traits frequently mediate coevolutionary interactions between predator and prey or parasite and host. Previous efforts to understand and predict the coevolutionary dynamics of these interactions have generally assumed that standing genetic variation is fixed or absent altogether. We develop a genetically explicit model of coevolution that bridges the gap between these approaches by allowing genetic variation itself to evolve. Analysis of this model shows that the evolution of genetic variance has important consequences for the dynamics and outcome of coevolution. Of particular importance is our demonstration that coevolutionary cycles can emerge in the absence of stabilizing selection, an outcome not possible in previous models of coevolution mediated by quantitative traits. Whether coevolutionary cycles evolve depends upon the strength of selection, the number of loci, and the rate of mutation in each of the interacting species. Our results also generate novel predictions for the expected sign and magnitude of linkage disequilibria in each species.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2005.tb00918.x,0
EVALUATION OF ASSOCIATIONS OF THE POLYMORPHISM IN THE PLACENTA-SPECIFIC PROMOTER 1.1 OF THE CYP19 GENE IN BLACK AND WHITE AND JERSEY CATTLE WITH MILK PRODUCTION TRAITS,"The relationship between the SNP of the cytochrome P450 gene (CYP19-PvuII) and milk production traits of Black-and-White and Jersey cattle were analysed. A total of 437 cows were included in the study. A PCR-RFLP was used to genotype. The frequencies of genotypes and alleles for the Black-and-White cows were as follows: 0.8985 AA, 0.0977 AB, 0.0038 BB, and 0.9474 CYP19, 0.0526 CYP19. In the Jersey, all cows were genotyped as CYP19 (no polymorphism). There weren’t any associations between CYP19-PvuII polymorphism and milk production traits of the investigated cows.",,0
Comparing Genotyping‐by‐Sequencing and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Chip Genotyping for Quantitative Trait Loci Mapping in Wheat,"ABSTRACT Array‐ or chip‐based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are widely used in genomic studies because of their abundance in a genome and lower cost per data point than older marker technologies. Genotyping‐by‐sequencing (GBS), a relatively newer approach of genotyping, suggests equal appeal because of its lesser cost per data point and the avoidance of ascertainment bias during genotyping. In this study, we compared the results from quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, marker distribution on linkage maps, genome size, recombination sites covered by the markers, and cost per polymorphic marker, as well as the methodology and workflow between the Illumina Infinium 9000 SNP‐chip genotyping with GBS. Results indicate that while GBS offers similar genome coverage at almost one‐fourth the cost of SNP chip, the SNP‐chip method is less demanding of computational skills and resources. Eight and nine QTL were detected in the GBS and SNP‐chip datasets, respectively, with one QTL common between the systems. Additionally, imputation accuracy of the GBS dataset was examined by introducing missing values randomly and imputing the missing alleles using a probabilistic principal components algorithm. Imputation results suggest recovery of the missing alleles with reasonable accuracy in datasets with low (up to 40%) amount of missing data is possible and can provide acceptable accuracy in gene mapping. Overall, the comparative results indicate that both approaches provide good genome coverage and similar mapping results. The choice of the genotyping platform is decided by the nature of the study and available resources.",https://doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2015.06.0389,0

EFFECT OF NEDD4L GENE FIVE COMMON POLYMORPHISMS ON HYPERTENSION-RELATED PHENOTYPES IN HAN CHINESE HYPERTENSION PATIENTS,"<h3>Objectives</h3> Hypertension is a complex disorder; part is due to genetic determinants. Mounting evidence has suggested that NEDD4L plays a pivotal role in maintaining Na<sup>+</sup> balance, extracellular fluid volume and long term blood pressure control. We therefore regarded NEDD4L as a hypertension-susceptibility gene and genotyped its 5 common intronic polymorphisms to assess their association with hypertension-related phenotypes including Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> in serum, and plasma renin activity (PRA). <h3>Methods</h3> A total of 1537 individuals were recruited and they were of Han Chinese descent including 669 patients with essential hypertension, 658 normal individuals and 210 patients with primary aldosteronism. The medical records were collected from Shanghai Ruijin Hospital containing the serum and urinary electrolytes and PRA and generally they were city-dwellers. DNA was extracted from whole blood and genotyping was carried out by allele discrimination method. Data were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis Test, single-locus and haplotype analyses by SAS programme and SimHap software. <h3>Results</h3> The serum sodium concentration between normal and hypertensive patients was statistically different p&lt;0.0001) and it was statistically different between control and patients with primary aldosteronism as well p&lt;0.0001). The five studied polymorphisms met Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the population (p&gt;0.05). Single-locus analysis suggested that rs10503020 was associated with serum Na<sup>+</sup> concentration and PRA (p=0.034 and 0.043, respectively) under additive model in essential hypertension patients. But in normal group, Na<sup>+</sup> concentration was not related with the SNP rs10503020 under the add model. Patients with rs10503020 C allele had higher levels of PRA than those with TT genotypes (CC+CT: 3.57 vsTT: 2.96 ng/ml/h) and were more sensitive to postural change (p=0.147). Moreover, in hypertensive group, rs4149601 was associated with plasma aldosterone concentration in the additive model (p=0.032). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Although both cases9 serum Na<sup>+</sup> concentration was significantly different between control and case, only in hypertensive group was it associated with rs10503020. Our results demonstrated that rs10503020 of NEDD4L gene might influence sodium re-absorption in kidney and plasma rennin activity to some extent in hypertensive people in Han Chinese.",https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2012-302920a.148,0
The link between social comparison orientation and domain-specific risk-taking: exploring the mediating role of two dimensions of trait competitiveness,"Introduction Our recent research has demonstrated that social comparison orientation of ability (SCO-ability) is an antecedent of trait competitiveness (TC), and TC mediates the relation between SCO-ability and domain-specific risk-taking. TC is a multi-dimensional trait, therefore we sought to expand on prior research by examining whether SCO-ability predicted two distinct dimensions of TC: hypercompetitive orientation (HCO) and self-development competitive orientation (SDCO). Methods We investigated how these different dimensions of TC mediated the relation between SCO-ability and both overall and domain-specific risk-taking in two correlational studies of 622 college students (313 males, mean age = 22.10, SD = 2.35) and 717 adult workers (368 males, mean age = 27.92, SD = 5.11). Results We found that SCO-ability positively predicted HCO. Together, SCO-ability and HCO predicted overall risk-taking and risk-taking in the recreational and ethical domains in both samples. HCO mediated the relation between SCO-ability and both overall risk-taking and risk-taking in the recreational and ethical domains. Additionally, SCO-ability positively predicted SDCO. SCO-ability and SDCO mainly predicted risk-taking in the recreational domain in both studies. SDCO mediated the relation between SCO-ability and risk-taking only in the recreational domain. Discussion Collectively, the findings above advance our understanding of the relation between competition and risk-taking by using differentiated measures of TC (HCO and SDCO). Our findings suggest that HCO is more strongly related to risk-taking than SDCO, thereby refining the possible role of SCO-ability and TC in predicting overall risk-taking and domain-specific risk-taking.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1340009,0
Investigation of the Mediator Role of Career Adapt-abilities in the Relationship Between Big Five Factor Personality Traits and Career Distress,"Career distress is an important construct for understanding career development in young adults. Revealing the variables associated with this construct has the potential to contribute to the reduction and prevention of career distress.

The association of prolactin gene polymorphism with egg production traits in Alabio and Mojosari ducks,"Prolactin (PRL) affects egg production in duck as it induces broodiness and promotes follicles development. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between polymorphism of PRL gene and egg production traits in Alabio and Mojosari Ducks. Genomic DNA were isolated from 111 blood samples (51 Alabio and 60 Mojosari). PCR and sequencing were performed to identify poly-morphisms and genotype of the animals. Data recording of the ducks including body weight at 16 weeks of age and at first egg, average weight of three first eggs laid and egg number laid up to 3, 6 and 12 months production were collected. Data were analyzed using independent sample t-Test. As a result, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were detected in intron 4. Both SNP C-5796A and SNP T-5817C were found to have association with egg number laid up to three months (P&lt;0,005). The CA/TC genotype had higher egg number than CC/TT. These suggested that SNP C-5796A and SNP T-5817C could be potential markers for marker assisted selection to increase egg number in duck.",https://doi.org/10.14710/jitaa.47.3.184-191,0
202 ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BMP4 GENE POLYMORPHISM AND OVUM PICK-UP IN VITRO PRODUCTION TRAITS IN BRAZILIAN Gyr COWS,"In Bos taurus taurus, previous studies have reported an association between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in BMP4 gene and the blastocyst rate in cows evaluated for in vitro embryo production efficacy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the degree of association between a polymorphism in the BMP4 gene and characteristics related to in vitro embryo production as well as pregnancies thereof in Bos taurus indicus cattle (Gyr breed). Data from 212 ovum pick-up in vitro (OPU-IPV) sessions were collected of 50 Gyr cows in the Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. The OPU-IVP procedures were performed and associated with marker SNP. The OPU-IVP traits were number and proportion of viable cumulus-oocyte complexes, number and proportion of cleaved embryos at Day 4 of culture, number and ratio of transferable embryos at Day 7 of culture, number and proportion of pregnancies at Day 30 after transfer, and number and proportion of pregnancies at Day 60 after transfer. DNA was extracted from hair follicles. BMP4 polymorphism, the segment of the BMP4 gene (exon 2, SNP rs109778173) was amplified by PCR with a specific primer. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was used for genotyping. HinfI restriction enzyme that recognises and cleaves the sequence 5′ G? ANTC 3′ was used. The samples were submitted to capillary electrophoresis Fragment Analyzer™ (Advanced Analytical Technologies Inc., Ames, IA) for allelic discrimination by size and polymorphism identification. Genotypic frequency, allele frequency, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium probability, gene homozygosity, gene heterozygosity, effective allele number, and polymorphism information content were statistically analysed in the software PowerMarker v.3.25 (North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA). The association between DNA marker and the OPU-IVP traits and pregnancy rates was make by analysis of variance of repeated data PROC GLIMMIX of SAS 2009 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The domain of the protein coding of BMP4 gene is located in exon 2. A fragment of the sequence of DNA in exon 2 was amplified, where the mutation SNP rs109778173 was identified (G &gt; T) in Gyr cows using PCR-RFLP and capillary electrophoresis methods. Three genotypes were identified (GG, TT, and GT) with genotypic frequencies of 0.64, 0.32, and 0.04 respectively; allelic frequency and Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. The polymorphism was significantly associated with the number of viable oocyte complexes, ratio of viable oocyte complex, and ratio of pregnancies at 30 days (P &gt; 0.01). The GT genotype affects negatively the number and proportion of viable cumulus-oocyte complexes and the proportion of pregnancies at Day 30 after transfer. This finding is an indication of a genetic effect of these characteristics.",https://doi.org/10.1071/rdv27n1ab202,0

The Effects of Personality Traits on Junior High School Students' Peer Relationships: The Mediating Role of Interpersonal Emotion Regulation,"To explore the relationship between personality traits, interpersonal emotion regulation and peer relationships. A total of 731 junior high school students were enrolled in the study, and were measured and analyzed using the Five-Factor Personality Questionnaire for Middle School Students, the Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and the Adolescent Peer Relationship Scale. (1) Positive personality traits, use of interpersonal emotion regulation strategies, and peer relationships were significantly better among junior high school boys than girls (P < 0.001), and junior high school students with higher grades were more likely to be in a positive state in terms of personality traits, to use more interpersonal emotion regulation strategies, and to have better peer relationships; (2) Personality traits were significantly negatively correlated with poor peer relationships (r = -0.35, P < 0.01), and significantly positively correlated with interpersonal emotion regulation (r = 0.61, P < 0.01), interpersonal emotion regulation was significantly negatively correlated with poor peer relationships (r = -0.41, P < 0.01); (3) the results of the mediation analysis showed that interpersonal emotion regulation partially mediated the relationship between personality traits and peer relationships after controlling for gender and grade ranking. Personality traits not only directly affect junior high school students' peer relationships, but also indirectly affect the quality of peer relationships through interpersonal emotion regulation.",https://doi.org/10.23977/appep.2024.050219,0
"Influence of Pranic Agriculture on Morphological Traits, Chlorophyll Content and Genetic Polymorphism of Ridge Gourd (Luffa acutangula L. Roxb.) Assessed by RAPD Marker Analysis","Pranic agriculture is a newly emerging concept of sustainable and eco-friendly agriculture. Pranic agriculture techniques are applied to plants before sowing and at the time of plant development to improve growth and yield. The present study aimed to understand the influence of pranic agriculture on growth, yield, and genetic polymorphism of ridge gourd. An increase in root length by 38%, stem girth by 8%, and the number of days taken for the premier harvest was advanced and found to be significant (p&lt;.05) in pranic treated plots against the control. Chlorophyll content was 26% higher (p&lt;.05) in pranic treated plants when compared to control. To find out the probable effects of pranic agriculture at molecular levels, RAPD marker analysis was carried out and average polymorphism up to 47% was observed between pranic and control treatments. Thus, pranic treatment was found to be very effective in increasing the overall growth and yield of ridge gourd. Further, in-depth studies are warranted about molecular mechanisms that are bringing changes in the plants after pranic treatment.",https://doi.org/10.17503/agrivita.v42i3.2715,0

Methods A total of 96 controls and 345 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical College and Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University were enrolled in our study. The patients with type 2 diabetes were divided into 3 groups based on the level of fasting blood glucose and 2 h postprandial blood glucose. DNA samples were extracted by the modified sodium iodide extraction method for the nested PCR amplification of target fragments followed by sequencing to determine the 11β-HSD1 5′ end-2940 polymorphic loci rs846910-G / A genotype. Allele and genotype distribution frequencies were compared among different groups. Results GG genotype was common in the rs846910-G / A, however AA genotype was rare. The AA, AG, GG genotype frequencies in isolated fasting hyperglycemia (IFH) were 5.0%, 16.0% and 84.0%, respectively. The AA, AG, GG genotype frequencies in isolated postprandial hyperglycemia (IPH) were 4.0%, 16.6% and 80.0%, respectively. The AA, AG, GG genotype frequencies in combinedhyperglycemia (CH) were 4.7%, 15.8% and 79.2%, respectively. The AA, AG, GG genotype frequencies in control group were 5.9%, 32.9% and 61.2%, respectively. These frequences were significantly different among the four groups (P0.05), but no statistically significant difference between the three different clinical phenotypes (P0.05). The G allele was common in the rs846910-A / G, however the A allele was rare. The A and G alleles frequencies in IFH were 85.2% and 14.8%, respectively. The A and G alleles frequencies in IPH were 83.5% and 16.5%, respectively. The A and G alleles frequencies in CH were 85.4% and 14.6%, respectively. The A and G alleles frequencies in the control group were 75.9% and 24.1%, respectively. They were significantly different among the four groups (P0.05), but no statistically significant difference between the three different clinical phenotypes (P0.05). Conclusion Genetic variations in the 11β-HSD1 is associated with T2DM, but it is not associated with clinical phenotypes.",,0
Self-compassion as a mediator of the association between autistic traits and depressive/anxious symptomatology,"Self-compassion refers to the extension of kindness to oneself when faced with inadequacies, shortcomings or failures. This study examined the mediating role of self-compassion in the relationship between autistic traits and depressive/anxious symptomatology in the general population. Participants included 164 university students (69 males and 95 females) ranging in age from 18 to 51 years (mean = 23.16, standard deviation = 7.81). Participants completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient, the Self-Compassion Scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. A series of multiple mediation analyses was conducted using the bootstrapping method, and it was found that Total Self-Compassion and the two subscales of Compassionate Self-Responding and Uncompassionate Self-Responding partially mediated the relationship between autistic traits and anxious/depressive symptoms. The indirect effect of self-compassion accounted for 41.9% of the variance in the relationship between autistic traits and depressive symptoms and 50% of the variance in the relationship between autistic traits and anxiety symptoms. It was also further found that the correlation between autistic traits and self-compassion was significantly stronger in males than females. Although preliminary, the current findings suggest that self-compassion could potentially serve as a target for clinical intervention in individuals with elevated autistic traits who experience anxiety and/or depression. Lay Abstract In this study, we asked 164 undergraduate students to complete an online questionnaire. The questionnaire measured the students’ levels of autistic traits, self-compassion, and experience of anxiety and depression. We were interested in knowing if self-compassion (defined as the extension of kindness to oneself when faced with challenges) had any influence on the relationship between autistic traits and experiences of anxiety and depression. The results of the study indicated that self-compassion may be an important factor influencing the relationship between autistic traits and mental health, with higher levels of self-compassion being related to more positive mental health outcomes. Although the findings should be considered preliminary in nature, they do suggest that self-compassion could potentially be a target for clinical intervention in people with elevated autistic traits and experience anxiety and/or depression.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1362361320966853,0
"Genetics of complex traits: prediction of phenotype, identification of causal polymorphisms and genetic architecture","Complex or quantitative traits are important in medicine, agriculture and evolution, yet, until recently, few of the polymorphisms that cause variation in these traits were known. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), based on the ability to assay thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have revolutionized our understanding of the genetics of complex traits. We advocate the analysis of GWAS data by a statistical method that fits all SNP effects simultaneously, assuming that these effects are drawn from a prior distribution. We illustrate how this method can be used to predict future phenotypes, to map and identify the causal mutations, and to study the genetic architecture of complex traits. The genetic architecture of complex traits is even more complex than previously thought: in almost every trait studied there are thousands of polymorphisms that explain genetic variation. Methods of predicting future phenotypes, collectively known as genomic selection or genomic prediction, have been widely adopted in livestock and crop breeding, leading to increased rates of genetic improvement.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2016.0569,0
Marital offence-specific forgiveness as mediator in the relationships between personality traits and marital satisfaction among older couples: Perspectives on Lars Tornstam's theory of gerotranscendence,"Abstract As a result of the gerotranscendence process, marital satisfaction becomes especially important in old age. At the same time, researchers emphasise that the effect of seniors’ personality on their marital satisfaction depends on many mediators. The analysis of literature suggests that one such variable might be forgiveness. Thus, the aim of the present research was to investigate whether forgiveness mediates the relationship between personality traits and marital satisfaction in late adulthood. The study involved 315 participants aged 60–75. Three psychological methods were used: (a) the Marital Satisfaction Questionnaire for Older Persons; (b) the NEO-Five Factor Inventory; and (c) the Marital Offence-Specific Forgiveness Scale. The analyses that have been undertaken revealed a number of significant associations. Neuroticism was positively related to resentment-avoidance and negatively to benevolence and marital satisfaction, whereas extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness were negatively correlated with resentment and positively with benevolence and satisfaction. The results also showed that both dimensions of dyadic forgiveness mediated the relationships between personality traits and marital satisfaction in ageing persons. They suggest that forgiveness of a spouse, when enhanced, could work as a buffer against the negative impact of neuroticism on marital happiness, as well as allowing the transfer of positive aspects of extraverted, agreeable and conscientious tendencies into marriage. Practical implications of the study for counselling older adults are recommended.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0144686x21000465,0
&lt;em&gt;SFTPC&lt;/em&gt; genetic polymorphisms are associated with tuberculosis susceptibility and clinical phenotype in a Western Chinese Han population,"Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most common infectious diseases globally. The surfactant protein C (SFTPC), which is involved in innate immunity and surfactant function in the lung, may contribute toward the progression of TB. The aim of the present study was to preliminarily investigate the possible association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SFTPC gene with TB susceptibility and clinical phenotypes in a Western Chinese Han population. The improved multiplex ligation detection reaction method was used to genotype 6 SNPs in SFTPC, in 900 patients with TB and 1,534 healthy control subjects. It was found that the A allele for rs1124 and the C allele for rs8192313 were associated with increased susceptibility to TB, P=0.024 and P=0.045, respectively. However, these two P-values were not significant following Bonferroni correction. In all samples, the haplotype [CGA], representing three SFTPC variants, was revealed to increase the risk of TB (P=0.001 and P=0.005, following Bonferroni correction). Furthermore, patients with the AA genotype for rs1124 and with the CC genotype for rs8192313 were associated with higher levels of C-reactive protein (P=0.001 and P=0.005, respectively). The results of the present study indicated that the SFTPC SNPs may increase the susceptibility to TB and the immune response of the host to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and may potentially be novel biomarkers for the pathogenesis of TB.",https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2020.9230,0
Trait‐mediated community assembly during experimental grassland restoration is altered by planting year rainfall,"Abstract Ecological restoration outcomes are highly variable, undermining efforts to recover biodiversity and ecosystem functions. One poorly understood source of variability is ‘year effects’—interannual variation in environmental conditions during the first year of restoration that alter successional trajectories of plant communities. There have been few experimental tests disentangling planting years from other differences among restoration projects (e.g. edaphic conditions, restoration approach), particularly those resolving mechanisms for year effects such as planting‐year rainfall. Moreover, past year effect studies focused almost exclusively on species‐level consequences. Therefore, the extent to which year effects influence the traits of communities is unknown. To address these gaps and provide a mechanistic test of how precipitation contributes to year effects, we conducted an experiment where we manipulated rainfall (drought, average and high levels) during the first growing season, replicated across three establishment year treatments to disentangle the effects of precipitation from other drivers of year effects. In each establishment year, we seeded the same species mix to initiate grassland restoration. We then surveyed plant community compositions annually for 5 years to quantify trait responses of restored communities to planting year rainfall. We found that variation in planting‐year precipitation altered community assembly trajectories by influencing community‐weighted mean (CWM) trait composition, and these effects persisted for at least 5 years. Over time, CWM specific leaf area and CWM seed mass decreased and CWM plant height increased. The effect of age on CWM plant height was stronger in plots that received mean and high watering treatments compared to drought treatments. This effect was also observed for CWM seed mass, albeit weaker. We also found some evidence for planting year effects unrelated to planting‐year rainfall for the three CWM traits, illustrating how interannually varying environmental conditions besides rainfall can generate persistent year effect on plant communities through their traits. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide evidence for planting year rainfall interacting with community assembly to alter the functional trait composition of restored grasslands. This suggests that interannual variation in rainfall during establishment is an important source of divergent biodiversity and functional outcomes in restored grasslands.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.14430,0
The effect of ethical leadership on service recovery performance: A moderated mediation model of organizational virtuousness and trait mindfulness,"In the present study, we first examined the relationship between ethical leadership and frontline employees’ (FLEs’) service recovery performance (SRP) and then tested the mediating role of organizational virtuousness in the relationship between ethical leadership and SRP in service contexts. Finally, we examined the moderating effect of FLE trait mindfulness on the direct relationship between ethical leadership and organizational virtuousness, as well as the indirect relationship between ethical leadership and SRP, via organizational virtuousness. Three-waved survey data collected from 273 supervisor-employee dyads in different service sector organizations supported our hypothesized relationships. In addition to important theoretical implications, the study carries useful practical implications, particularly for managers who are concerned about improving SRP in the service contexts.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1036099,0
[Correlation analysis between clinical phenotypes of keloids and polymorphism of p53 gene codon 72].,"To observe the effect of gene expression of p53 and the polymorphism of p53 gene codon 72 on clinical phenotype of keloids.The tissue and blood samples were taken from 35 patients with keloids, 19 males and 16 females, and the course of disease was from 4 months to 8 years. Meanwhile, autologous peripheral blood was collected for genotype analysis. According to the observing scope, the tissue samples of the keloids were divided into 2 groups: the central group involving the central part of the keloids (the central area within two-thirds of the radius) and the peripheral group involving the peripheral part of the keloids (the peripheral area within one-third of the radius). According to the largest diameter of the keloids, the two groups were divided into 3 subgroups: the small size group with 5 patients (< 1 cm), the medium size group with 21 patients (1-3 cm) and the large size group with 9 patients (> 3 cm). DNA of the tissue and blood samples were extracted, and the PCR followed by DNA sequencing was used to detect the polymorphism of p53 gene codon 72. The expression change of P53 was detected by immunohistochemical staining. The fibroblast apoptosis in keloid tissues was detected by TUNEL method.The genetic genotype of p53 gene codon 72 in keloids included Arg/Arg in 7 cases, Pro/Arg in 21 cases, Pro/ Pro in 7 cases. The significant correlation was found between genotype and clinical phenotype (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemical staining revealed that P53 was detectable in peripheral and central groups of small-medium size keloids and central groups keloids, and detectable in few cells in peripheral groups of large size keloids. The absorbency value was 3 439.359 8 +/- 538.527 5 in Arg/Arg genotype, 3 273.186 2 +/- 375.213 9 in Arg/Pro genotype, 1 691.372 9 +/- 98.989 3 in Pro/Pro genotype. There were significant differences among the three genotypes (P < 0.05). The fibroblast apoptosis was detected by TUNEL, and the apoptotic cells were evenly distributed. The apoptosis index was 31.000 0 +/- 3.266 0 in peripheral group of large size keloids, 42.300 0 +/- 4.354 8 in peripheral group of medium size keloids, 44.600 0 +/- 5.253 6 in peripheral group of small size keloids. There were significant differences among the three groups (P < 0.05).There is close relationship between the clinical phenotype of keloids and the expression of P53. The polymorphism variation of p53 gene codon 72 is beneficial for apoptosis of fibroblasts in keloids.",,0
No association between serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms and personality traits,"Human family and twin studies have established considerable heritable components in personality traits as assessed by self-report questionnaires. Recently, an association between a functional polymorphism in the upstream regulatory region of the serotonin transporter gene and neuroticism-related personality traits was reported. Two different serotonin transporter polymorphisms including the previously associated variant were genotyped in two samples of healthy Swedish subjects (n = 127 and n = 178, respectively) assessed with the Karolinska Scales of Personality (KSP) inventory. No statistically significant association between serotonin transporter polymorphisms and any of the eight neuroticism-related KSP scales was found. Thus, the previously reported association between serotonin transporter alleles and neuroticism-related personality traits could not be replicated in the present study. Am. J. Med. Genet.

BowSaw: inferring higher-order trait interactions associated with complex biological phenotypes,"Abstract Machine learning is helping the interpretation of biological complexity by enabling the inference and classification of cellular, organismal and ecological phenotypes based on large datasets, e.g. from genomic, transcriptomic and metagenomic analyses. A number of available algorithms can help search these datasets to uncover patterns associated with specific traits, including disease-related attributes. While, in many instances, treating an algorithm as a black box is sufficient, it is interesting to pursue an enhanced understanding of how system variables end up contributing to a specific output, as an avenue towards new mechanistic insight. Here we address this challenge through a suite of algorithms, named BowSaw, which takes advantage of the structure of a trained random forest algorithm to identify combinations of variables (“rules”) frequently used for classification. We first apply BowSaw to a simulated dataset, and show that the algorithm can accurately recover the sets of variables used to generate the phenotypes through complex Boolean rules, even under challenging noise levels. We next apply our method to data from the integrative Human Microbiome Project and find previously unreported high-order combinations of microbial taxa putatively associated with Crohn’s disease. By leveraging the structure of trees within a random forest, BowSaw provides a new way of using decision trees to generate testable biological hypotheses.",https://doi.org/10.1101/839357,0

Prion protein gene polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease: one modulatory trait of cognitive decline?,"Although its main biological function is still unknown, the prion protein is involved in normal synaptic function.1Interestingly, the presence of a valine (V), replacing a methionine (M) at codon 129 of the prion protein gene (PRNP), has been associated with poor performance in cognitive tests in a large cohort of aged, non-demented, French people.2 Accordingly, this polymorphic gene represents a suitable candidate for an association with Alzheimer's disease, a dementing disorder characterised by neuronal degeneration and synaptic loss. To assess whether the PRNP V/M codon129 polymorphism—alone or in combination with polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein (APO)E3 and interleukin (IL)-1α4 genes, already shown to be associated with Alzheimer's disease—affects the occurrence or clinical features of the disease, we performed a case-control study in a cohort of Italian patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease and age matched healthy controls.

Venous blood was collected from 212 Italian patients (130 women, 82 men; mean (SD) age at disease onset 68.3 (8.0) years) affected by clinically probable Alzheimer's disease, according to McKhann's criteria. Patients were also divided into those with early disease onset (⩽65 years; 72 patients; mean (SD) age at disease onset 57.0 (7.5) years), and those with a late onset (>65 years; 140 patients; mean (SD) age …",https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp.71.2.279,0
Two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter of the ovine myostatin gene (<i><scp>MSTN</scp></i>) and their effect on growth and carcass muscle traits in <scp>N</scp>ew <scp>Z</scp>ealand <scp>R</scp>omney sheep,"Myostatin is a negative regulator of muscle growth and development in mammals, and variation in ovine myostatin gene (MSTN) has been demonstrated to be associated with variation in the muscularity of sheep. Polymerase chain reaction-single-stranded conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) was used to look for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 304-bp amplicon from the promoter region of ovine MSTN. Sequence analyses revealed two previously identified SNPs (c.-2449G/C and c. -2379T/C) that resulted in three haplotypes (H1 (c.[-2449G; -2379C]), H2 (c.[-2449C; -2379C]) and H3 (c.[-2449G; -2379T]). The effect of these SNPs on growth and carcass traits was investigated in 357 NZ Romney lambs. General linear mixed-effect models revealed that sheep with the genotype c.-2449GC had a higher loin meat yield (p = 0.032) and proportion loin yield (p = 0.028), than those with the genotype c.-2449GG. The genotype c.-2379CC was associated with an increase in three weight traits: birthweight (p = 0.003), tailing weight (p = 0.009) and weaning weight (p = 0.028), when compared with the genotype c.-2379TC, but it was not found to have an association with growth rate. This suggests that c.-2379T/C has an effect that originates at, or before birth. Haplotype H3 was associated with a decrease in birthweight (p = 0.002), tailing weight (p = 0.003) and weaning weight (p = 0.011). Haplotype H2 was associated with increased loin yield (p = 0.012) and proportion loin yield (p = 0.002). The SNPs may have value as genetic markers for improved Romney breeding.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jbg.12171,0
AB0173 ALLELIC POLYMORPHISM OF PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE GENES AS A BASIS FOR THE FORMATION OF PHENOTYPES OF JUVENILE IDIOPATHIC ARTHRITIS,"Background: The pathological process of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) largely depends on pro-inflammatory cytokines, the polymorphism of the alleles of some genes of which we have the opportunity to study. No studies have been conducted on the dependence of certain features of the pathological process of JIA on the polymorphism of the IL-6(G-174C) and TNF(G308A) genes. Objectives: To reveal the dependence of JIA phenotypes and its course on genetic polymorphism of alleles IL-6 and TNF. Methods: Polymorphism of the IL-6 and TNF genes was studied by PCR-method using allele-specific primers 44 patients 1-17 y.o. (24f, 20m) with JIA. The level of IL-6 and TNFα in the serum was determined using ECLIA and CLIA methods. Results: There were 73% cases with an unfavorable course of the disease (UCD) of the patients with the CC allele of the IL-6 gene, for most patients average activity was JADAS27 13.5±1.6. oJIA (50%) &amp; uveitis (30%) were the most frequent among subgroups. The level of serum IL6 was 74.1±69.5 pg/ml, TNFα 27.4±17.3 pg/ml (ratio IL6/TNFα=4.3±2.1). Among patients with GC IL6 70% female, 79% with UCD. More often pJIA (36%, including all RF+) and eJIA (35%) were noted with the largest frequency of inclusion of the hip joints (33%), spine (35%), detection of secondary osteoporosis (43%). The metabolic changes were registered on the ECG in 82% cases. The serum IL-6 level was 11.35±2.95 pg/ml, TNF 241.75 pg/ml (IL-6/TNFα=0.047, p&lt;0.05 vs CC allele). Children with GG IL-6 (wild allele) with a more favorable course of the JIA (31%, less than in the CC and GC groups (p&lt;0.05), only 8% had the highest disease activity), the largest number of patients with sJIA (25%) was registered in this group. The detection of HLA B27 was significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) than in other alleles, while 60% cases were ANA+ (more than in the group GC, p&lt;0.05). The highest level of serum IL6 (35.3±18.9 pg/ml) &amp; the highest average number of mutations in folate metabolism genes (4±0.51) were revealed in this group. The wild allele GG prevailed (n=32) among the TNF gene alleles, sex ratio 1:1, UCD in 70%. The number of active joints, ESR, CRP, ANA-positivity (50%), HLA B27+ (53%) were unsignificantly higher than in GA TNF allele, while serum IL6 level (22.8±9.8 pg/ml) &amp; TNFα (12.3±4.1 pg/ml) were lower. In patients with the GA TNF gene allele, an UCD (73%), eJIA (36%) were noted slightly more often. By such parameters as the patient’s gender, the presence of uveitis, damage to the hip joints, the type of synovitis, metabolic changes on the ECG, indicators were observed comparable with the wild allele group. IL6 level was 48.3±39.2 pg/ml, TNFα 636.5±420.1 pg/ml, IL6/TNFα=0.07±0.06 (vs 1.9±0.5 in GG group, p&lt;0.05). The genotype of two wild alleles TNF GG with IL6 GG expectedly showed the smallest proportion of the UCD (33%, p &lt;0.05), the most frequency of ANA-positivity (71%), with no uveitis and RF+pJIA in this group. All cases of RF+pJIA had TNF GA and IL6 GC. oJIA prevailed (57%) in the TNF GG&amp;IL6 CC group, there was not a single case of sJIA, and the AJ number was the smallest (2.86±0,5). The largest group was TNF GG &amp; IL6 GC (n=14). 91% of cases had UCD, AJ=6.6±2.4, damage to the hip joints in 40%, ESR 23.7±6.7 mm/h, CRP 14.5±5.4 mg/l, metabolic changes on the ECG in 100%, but ANA+ only at 13%. In general, there was no correlation between the cytokine content in the blood serum during of active disease in the examined children with features of allelic polymorphism of these genes. Conclusion: Depending on the allele polymorphism of the IL-6 and TNF genes, certain phenotypes of the JIA course may be distinguished. Thus, revealing the polymorphism of these alleles in patients at the onset of the disease, we can predict to some extent its course and take this into account when choosing treatment tactics.

"Association of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;PIT-1&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; gene polymorphism with birth weight, milk and reproduction traits in Isfahan Holstein cows (Brief Report)","Abstract. Pit-1 (POU1F1) is a member of the POU-domain family of genes that play important regulatory roles in developmental processes (DYBUS et al. 2004). Pit-1, an approximate 33-kilodalton protein (291 amino acid), was first associated with a critical role in the transcriptional regulation of growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) genes (DYBUS et al. 2003). Molecular basis of this polymorphism was the silent mutation (G→A) located within exon 6 of the Pit-1 gene (DIERKES et al. 1998). Pit-1 gene considered as a candidate marker for milk production due to regulation of expression of bGH and the prolactin genes which are essential for mammary gland development and milk yield (DYBUS et al. 2004).",https://doi.org/10.5194/aab-52-445-2009,0
Obesity phenotype in relation to gene polymorphism among samples of Egyptian children and their mothers,"Obesity is complex heterogeneous disease controlled by genes, environmental factors, and their interaction. Genetic factors account for 40-90% of the body mass index variations. Body mass index (BMI) of children correlates more closely with maternal than paternal BMI. So, this studu was aimed to investigate the role of leptin receptor LEPR Gln223Arg, the uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2 G 866 A) and insulin receptor gene (INSR exon 17) polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of obesity. A cross-sectional study executed on 130 children and their obese mothers; classified into 2 groups according to their BMI. The 2 groups were evaluated regarding the anthropometry. Restriction fragment length analysis for LEPR Gln223Arg, UCP2 -866 G/A and INSR exon 17 polymorphisms were applied. It was reported that increased risk of obesity was found in LEPR AG + AA genotype and the A allele. Significant statistical difference was detected only in female children. Concerning UCP2, the AG followed by the GG genotype was the most frequent in all groups and the G allele was the mostly present in obese mothers and obese male children but with no statistical significance. There was difference in the INSR genotype and alleles between groups, but this difference was not statistically significant. This study concluded that the LEPR Gln223Arg, UCP2 G 866 A and INSR exon 17 polymorphisms are related to obesity in Egyptian population. Further researches on larger population are recommended to ascertain the implications of LEPR, UCP2 and INSR polymorphisms in obesity.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gendis.2017.12.004,0
<i>MC4R</i>gene polymorphism and its association with meat traits of Karachai sheep grown in Russian Federation,"This paper presents the results on the study of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) gene polymorphisms in sheep of the Karachai breed. AA, AG, and GG genotypes were determined to have allele frequencies of 47%, 37%, and 16%, respectively, indicating that allele A and the homozygous AA genotype occurred the most frequently. Analysis of the meat productivity of sheep, with respect to the MC4R genotype, showed a higher slaughter yield in sheep with the AA genotype compared to those with either the GG or AG genotypes. The variability at these loci provides a basis for controlling the meat productivity of sheep in the Karachai sheep population; therefore, this polymorphism should be monitored and melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) gene selection considered in pedigree farms.",https://doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2021.1883624,0
Psychopathic Traits and Victimization: What Mechanisms Mediate the Relationship?,"Psychopathy has been linked to a host of negative outcomes including victimization; yet, the mechanisms that may explain this relationship have not been identified. Using data from the Pathways to Desistance study, a longitudinal study of adolescents adjudicted for serious offenses ( N = 1,354) who had been adjudicated in either Maricopa County, AZ, or Philadelphia County, PA, we examine several mechanisms that may mediate the relationship between psychopathy and violent victimization. A 1 SD increase in psychopathy increases the risk of victimization by about 9.3%, net of control variables. Psychopathy is linked to violent victimization through its significant influences on engagement in risky behaviors, moral disengagement, motivations to succeed, and expectations for the future. These findings are striking given that they identify factors such as cognition and engagement in risky behavior that may be suitable targets for change in prevention or intervention efforts.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0093854820919915,0
"Polymorphisms, Chromosomal Rearrangements, and Mutator Phenotype Development during Experimental Evolution of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG","Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG is a lactic acid bacterium widely marketed by the food industry. Its genomic analysis led to the identification of a gene cluster encoding mucus-binding SpaCBA pili, which is located in a genomic island enriched in insertion sequence (IS) elements. In the present study, we analyzed by genome-wide resequencing the genomic integrity of L. rhamnosus GG in four distinct evolutionary experiments conducted for approximately 1,000 generations under conditions of no stress or salt, bile, and repetitive-shearing stress. Under both stress-free and salt-induced stress conditions, the GG population (excluding the mutator lineage in the stress-free series [see below]) accumulated only a few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and no frequent chromosomal rearrangements. In contrast, in the presence of bile salts or repetitive shearing stress, some IS elements were found to be activated, resulting in the deletion of large chromosomal segments that include the spaCBA-srtC1 pilus gene cluster. Remarkably, a high number of SNPs were found in three strains obtained after 900 generations of stress-free growth. Detailed analysis showed that these three strains derived from a founder mutant with an altered DNA polymerase subunit that resulted in a mutator phenotype. The present work confirms the stability of the pilus production phenotype in L. rhamnosus GG under stress-free conditions, highlights the possible evolutionary scenarios that may occur when this probiotic strain is extensively cultured, and identifies external factors that affect the chromosomal integrity of GG. The results provide mechanistic insights into the stability of GG in regard to its extensive use in probiotic and other functional food products.Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG is a widely marketed probiotic strain that has been used in numerous clinical studies to assess its health-promoting properties. Hence, the stability of the probiotic functions of L. rhamnosus GG is of importance, and here we studied the impact of external stresses on the genomic integrity of L. rhamnosus GG. We studied three different stresses that are relevant for understanding its robustness and integrity under both ex vivo conditions, i.e., industrial manufacturing conditions, and in vivo conditions, i.e., intestinal tract-associated stress. Overall, our findings contribute to predicting the genomic stability of L. rhamnosus GG and its ecological performance.",https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.00255-16,0
CRS-PCR polymorphisms of the GHR gene and its relationship with milk production traits in Chinese Holstein cows,"Abstract Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of exon 8 of the GHR gene were detected in Chinese Holstein cows by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The results showed that exon 8 of the GHR gene digested by Tas I could be divided into two kinds of alleles and three kinds of genotypes. The frequencies of allele A and T were 0.6339 and 0.3661, respectively. The frequencies of genotypes AA, AT and TT were 0.459, 0.350 and 0.191, respectively. Sequencing showed one single nucleotide mutation T→A at 4962 bp of the gene in genotype TT when compared with genotype AA, and this mutation resulted in an amino acid change of phenylalanine (TTT)→tyrosine (TAT). The result of χ 2 testing indicated that the genotypic frequency of the GHR gene digested by Tas I did not fit with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in this population ( P &lt;0.05). The least-square mean of the fat percentage of this population was higher for genotype TT than for genotype AA ( P &lt;0.05).",https://doi.org/10.1017/s1479236209990283,0
Genetic structure of milk protein polymorphisms and effects on milk production traits in a local dairy cattle,"Summary The milk protein genetic structure of the Reggiana dairy local cattle with remarkable milk quality properties was analysed and compared with the structure of Italian Friesian and Italian Brown cattle. A total of 1138 individual milk samples from the three breeds were typed by isoelectrofocusing. Polymorphism was found at the α s1 ‐casein ( CSN1S1 ), β ‐casein ( CSN2 ), κ ‐casein ( CSN3 ), and β ‐lactoglobulin ( LGB ) loci. High frequencies were observed for some casein alleles in Reggiana ( CSN1S1*C, 25%; CSN2*B : 28%) with considerable differences to those observed in a survey carried out 30 years before. A great variation among breeds was observed for casein haplotype frequencies and high linkage disequilibrium was detected at the three polymorphic casein loci CSN1S1‐CSN2‐CSN3. The prevalent haplotypes were CA 2 B (23%; Reggiana), BA 2 A (48%; Italian Friesian) and BA 2 B (51%; Italian Brown). Higher G ST values between breeds were observed when haplotype frequencies were considered instead of gene frequencies. In the Reggiana cattle, the occurrence of two casein alleles at a rather high frequency ( CSN1S1*C, CSN2*B ) allowed to estimate the effects of rare casein haplotypes on milk traits. The CA 2 B haplotype was associated with a significantly higher milk protein and fat content and a significantly higher protein per cent was found also for the BA 1 B haplotype.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0388.2003.00443.x,0
CRISPR/Cas-Mediated Genome Editing for Improvement of Plant Traits,"Crop development has always been a major area of research for plant breeders. The present stress conditions can bring changes in the plant physiology and metabolism which thereby affect the yield and other possible traits. So far, the conventional methods of breeding were the only option, but now new innovations have made ways for efficient modifications in plant genomes in a shorter time period comparatively. The present scenario of plant research is focused on the development of sustainable, better, and efficient crop system. Considering this, many genome editing techniques have developed like ZFNs, TALENS, CRISPR/Cas, etc. The recently developed CRISPR/Cas system of plant genome editing is a technique used to obtain desired traits and minimizing the barriers in the field of genome editing. Different characteristics of plant in terms of its growth, yield, quality, etc., are well modified using CRISPR/Cas. This chapter focuses on the recent researches done and how CRISPR is well utilized for improvement in plant traits.",https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003331759-15,0
"Association analysis of polymorphisms in SLK, ARHGEF9, WWC2, GAB3, and FSHR genes with reproductive traits in different sheep breeds","The aim was to investigate the relationship between polymorphisms of gene mutation loci and reproductive traits in local sheep breeds (Duolang Sheep) and introduced sheep breeds (Suffolk, Hu Sheep) in Xinjiang to provide new molecular markers for the selection and breeding of high fecundity sheep. The expression pattern of typing successful genes in sheep tissues was investigated by RT-qPCR technology, providing primary data for subsequent verification of gene function. The 26 mutation loci of WWC2, ARHGEF9, SLK, GAB3, and FSHR genes were typed using KASP. Association analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0, and the typing results showed that five genes with six loci, WWC2 (g.14962207 C&amp;gt;T), ARHGEF9 (g.48271079 C&amp;gt;A), SLK (g.27107842 T&amp;gt;C, g.27108855 G&amp;gt;A), GAB3 (g.86134602 G&amp;gt;A), and FSHR (g.80789180 T&amp;gt;G) were successfully typed. The results of the association analyses showed that WWC2 (g.14962207 C&amp;gt;T), SLK (g.27108855 G&amp;gt;A), ARHGEF9 (g.48271079 C&amp;gt;A), and FSHR (g.80789180 T&amp;gt;G) caused significant or extremely significant effects on the litter size in Duolang, Suffolk and Hu Sheep populations. The expression distribution pattern of the five genes in 12 sheep reproduction-related tissues was examined by RT-qPCR. The results showed that the expression of the SLK gene in the uterus, the FSHR gene in the ovary, and the ARHGEF9 gene in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis-related tissues were significantly higher than in the tissues of other parts of the sheep. WWC2 and GAB3 genes were highly expressed both in reproductive organs and visceral tissues. In summary, the WWC2 (g.14962207 C&amp;gt;T), SLK (g.27108855 G&amp;gt;A), ARHGEF9 (g.48271079 C&amp;gt;A), and FSHR (g.80789180 T&amp;gt;G) loci can be used as potential molecular markers for detecting differences in reproductive performance in sheep. Due to variations in typing results, the SLK (g.27107842 T&amp;gt;C) and GAB3 (g.86134602 G&amp;gt;A) loci need further validation.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2024.1371872,0
<i><scp>PNPLA3</scp></i> polymorphisms (rs738409) and non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease risk and related phenotypes: a meta‐analysis,"Abstract Background and Aim One single‐nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP s) rs738409 in the patatin‐like phospholipase domain‐containing 3 gene ( PNPLA3 ) has been implicated in susceptibility to non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) across different populations. One meta‐analysis confirmed this association, but within it, only two A sian studies were included. This meta‐analysis aimed to investigate the association in Asian population. Methods All eligible case‐control studies were identified by searching through PubMed and Chinese language databases ( CNKI and WanFang) up to J uly 1, 2014. Pooled estimates (odds ratio [OR] and standardized mean difference) were used to assess the strength of associations in fixed or random‐effects models. Results A total of 12 studies with 4495 cases and 7431 controls were included. SNP rs738409 G allele was confirmed as a risk factor for NAFLD ( G allele vs C allele: OR = 1.92, 95% confidence interval [95% CI ]: 1.54‐2.39). In addition, based on studies with certain clinical measurements data, G allele carriers were more likely to have higher level of serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) (standard mean difference [ SMD ] = 7.03, 95% CI : 2.47‐11.60), and higher fibrosis score ( SMD = 0.39, 95% CI : 0.18‐0.60). Conclusion This study provided evidence of SNP rs738409 G allele as a strong risk factor of NAFLD susceptibility and higher level of serum ALT in A sian population.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.12889,0
Bioinformatics analysis and genetic polymorphisms in genomic region of the bovine <i>SH2B2</i> gene and their associations with molecular breeding for body size traits in qinchuan beef cattle,"Abstract The Src homology 2 B 2 (SH2B2) gene regulate energy balance and body weight at least partially by enhancing Janus kinase-2 (JAK2)-mediated cytokine signaling, including leptin and/or GH signaling. Leptin is an adipose hormone that controls body weight. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the association between body measurement traits and SH2B2 gene polymorphisms as responsible mutations. For this purpose, we selected four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SH2B2 gene, including two in intron 5 (g.20545A&amp;gt;G, and g.20570G&amp;gt;A, one synonymous SNP g.20693T&amp;gt;C, in exon 6 and one in intron 8 (g.24070C&amp;gt;A, and genotyped them in Qinchuan cattle. SNPs in sample populations were in medium polymorphism level (0.250&amp;lt;PIC&amp;lt;0.500). Association study indicated that the g.20570G&amp;gt;A, g.20693T&amp;gt;C, and g.24070C&amp;gt;A, significantly (P &amp;lt; 0.05) associated with body length (BL) and chest circumference (CC) in Qinchuan cattle. In addition, H4H3 and H5H5 diplotype had highly significantly (P &amp;lt; 0.01) greater body length (BL), rump length (RL), and chest circumference (CC) than H4H2. Our investigation will not only extend the spectrum of genetic variation of bovine SH2B2 gene, but also provide useful information for the marker assisted selection in beef cattle breeding program.",https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20192113,0
Trait-Mediated Indirect Effects in Larval Anurans: Reversing Competition with the Threat of Predation,"Ecologists recently have been focusing on the role that trait-mediated indirect effects can have on community structure and composition. To date, this work has primarily focused on the effects of predator-induced behavioral plasticity on communities. However, predator-induced morphological plasticity, which has been documented in many taxa, might also lead to trait-mediated indirect effects. Here, I examined how predators altered the behavior and morphology of larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and leopard frogs (R. pipiens) and how these phenotypic changes altered the outcome of competition between the two species. Competition in the absence of caged predators was asymmetric; when reared separately, leopard frogs grew more than wood frogs, but when competing (without predators), wood frogs grew faster than leopard frogs. The presence of caged predators reversed the outcome of competition between the two anuran prey. In the presence of larval dragonflies (Anax spp.) or caged mudminnows (Umbra limi), leopard frogs grew faster than wood frogs while total tadpole biomass production remained unchanged. Thus, there was a predator-mediated indirect effect. Because predators alter both the behavior and morphology of larval anurans and both of these traits are known to affect resource consumption and growth, both are potential mechanisms to explain the change in competitive outcome. Changes in behavior were not related to changes in growth, but changes in morphology (specifically mouth width and tail length) were related to changes in growth. When competitors were added (without predators), wood frogs increased their mouth width by 10% and their tail length by 3%, while leopard frogs increased their mouth width by 5% and did not change their tail length. The greater increase in mouth width for wood frogs should increase their forage intake, since tadpoles feed by scraping periphyton; the importance of a 3% longer tail in competitive ability is unknown. The presence of the predator threat (via chemical cues from the caged predators) reduced both the mouth width and tail length in the two prey species to pre-competition levels. This response corresponded with the reduced competitive ability of the wood frogs. This work demonstrates that both competitors and predators can alter prey morphology and suggests that changes in morphology can cause trait-mediated indirect effects.",https://doi.org/10.2307/177114,0

Polymorphism in the interleukin-10 gene is associated with overactive bladder phenotype associated with HTLV-1 infection,"Abstract INTRODUCTION Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated inflammatory diseases are not well understood; however, their clinical manifestations may be influenced by the host genetic background. METHODS We genotyped 298 individuals with HTLV-1 and 380 controls for interleukin-10 (IL10) gene variants-rs3024496, rs1800871, rs1800896-and used logistic regression analysis to determine their association with clinical phenotypes. RESULTS No association with HTLV-1 infection was observed. However, allele A of rs1800896 (1082bp upstream) was associated with protection against neurological impairment, specifically overactive bladder (OR=0.447, 95% CI 0.28-0.70, p=0.001).

Characterization of Porcine Leptin Receptor Polymorphisms and Their Association with Reproduction and Production Traits,"Fatness in pigs is of prime economic importance due to market incentives for production of lean pork and elevated fatness increasing the feed costs. Leptin (LEP) action, mediated through its specific receptors (LEPR), was reported to be involved in the regulation of fatness via feed intake, energy expenditure, and whole-body energy balance in pigs. In this study, we have designed 17 primer sets based on the human and mouse LEPR sequences and successfully amplified coding regions of 15 porcine LEPR exon fragments by polymerase chain reactions (PCR). Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of Intron 2, Exons 2, 6, and 18 were found in Landrace, Yorkshire, and Duroc by mutagenetically separated-PCR (MS-PCR) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP). Chi-square statistics was used to calculate homogeneity of genotypic frequencies of 4 gene polymorphisms for three breeds of animals. Effects of Intron 2, Exon 2, and Exon 18 polymorphisms on the reproduction trait such as litter sizes of sows were evident (p < 0.05) in Duroc and Yorkshire. There was no (p > 0.05) significant influence on the production trait of average daily gain due to four candidate gene polymorphisms in three porcine breeds. However, effects of Exon 6 and 18 polymorphisms on the production trait of backfat thickness were significant (p < 0.05) in Landrace and Yorkshire, respectively. Effects of Exon 18 polymorphisms on feed efficiency were also evident (p < 0.05) in Duroc.",https://doi.org/10.1081/abio-120037903,0
Association between &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;IGF1/Tas&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;I polymorphism and milk traits of Polish Holstein Friesian cows,"Abstract. The study was carried out on 658 Polish Holstein Friesian cows. A transversion of A→C in the P1 promoter region of bovine IGF1 gene at position 977 bp upstream from the start codon in exon 1 was identified using ACRS-PCR method. Reverse primer introduced an artificial TasI restriction site. Three genotypes (AA, AC, CC) were found in the analysed herd of dairy cows occurred with a frequency of 0.766, 0.213 and 0.021, respectively. In the presented study, the statistically significant differences between individuals of different IGF1/TasI genotypes were found in milk, fat and protein yield. In the 2nd and 3rd lactations, the cows carrying the CC genotype produced more milk than the AA individuals (P≤0.05). In the case of protein and fat yield, similar tendencies were observed.",https://doi.org/10.5194/aab-54-10-2011,0
"Neuroticism, Trait Fear of Missing Out, and Phubbing: The Mediating Role of State Fear of Missing Out and Problematic Instagram Use","One of the relatively new negative consequences of smartphone use is ""phubbing"" (snubbing someone while an individual checks their smartphone in the middle of a real-life conversation). The purpose of the present study was to investigate the direct and indirect associations of neuroticism, trait anxiety, and trait fear of missing out with phubbing via state fear of missing out and problematic Instagram use. A total of 423 adolescents and emerging adults aged between 14 and 21 years (53% female) participated in the study. Findings indicated that females had significantly higher scores of phubbing, fear of missing out, problematic Instagram use, trait anxiety, and neuroticism. Path analysis showed that trait fear of missing out and neuroticism were indirectly associated with phubbing via state fear of missing out and problematic Instagram use. State fear of missing out was directly and indirectly associated with phubbing via problematic Instagram use. The present study is the first to demonstrate empirical evidence for the relationship between different dimensions of fear of missing out, problematic Instagram use, and phubbing.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-018-9959-8,0
Polymorphisms of SORBS1 Gene and Their Correlation with Milk Fat Traits of Cattleyak,"This study aimed to find the SNPs in the SORBS1 gene of cattleyak, analyze the relationship between its polymorphisms and the milk fat traits, and find potential molecular markers for the milk fat traits of cattleyak. The polymorphism of the SORBS1 gene in 350 cattleyak from Hongyuan County (Sichuan, China) were detected by PCR and DNA sequencing, and the correlation between these SNPs and the milk production traits of cattleyak was analyzed. The results showed that there were nine SNPs in the CDS and their adjacent non-coding regions of the SORBS1 gene, and all SNPs have three genotypes. The correlation analysis found that the genotypes with superior milk fat traits in the other eight alleles were homozygous genotypes with a high genotype frequency except the g.96284 G > A (c.3090 G > A) (p < 0.05). However, at locus g.96284 G > A, the milk fat percentage, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) of the GA genotype were significantly higher than that of GG and AA genotypes (p < 0.05). Among these SNPs, three SNPs (g.6256 C > T (c.298 C > T), g.24791 A > G (c.706 A > G) and g.29121 A > G (c.979 A > G)) caused the amino acids change. The genotypes of the three SNPs consist of three haplotypes and four diplotypes. The amino acid mutation degree of diplotype H1-H1 (CCAAAA) was the highest, and its milk fat percentage, MUFAs, PUFAs and SFAs were also the highest (p < 0.05). Taken together, we found nine SNPs in the SORBS1 gene that are closely related to the milk fat traits of cattleyak. Moreover, the mutation of amino acids caused by SNPs had positive effects on the milk fat traits of cattleyak. H1-H1 is the dominant diplotype which significantly related to the milk fat traits of cattleyak. This study provides a new molecular marker and theoretical basis for screening the milk fat traits of cattleyak.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11123461,0
Correlation between Polymorphisms of SIRT1 Gene and Carcass Traits in Beef Cattle,"In th is study, we took SIRT1 as a candidate gene, using PCR-SSCP and sequencing techniques to analyze genetic variation of 129 beef cattle including LZ, LXZ, QC, XZ cattle and XXZ cattle. The results showed that 5genotypes AA, AB, AD, BD and DD and four SNPs(Gen Bank Access NO: NM_001192980.1: g.-382 AG,-306TC,-274 G C,-271 G C) were found. Correlation analysis on different genotypes and slaughter performance indicated that in five cattle population, slaughter rate of AD and BD genotype was significantly higher than that of AB genotype(P 0.05), carcass weight of BD genotype was significantly greater than that of AA type( P 0.05), ribeye of BD genotype was significantly greater than that of AB, AD and DD type( P0.05), bone weight and meat percentage of BD genotype was significantly greater than that of AB and AD type( P 0.05), backfat of the AA genotype was the most thick in 5 genotypes and significantly greater than that of AB, AD, BD and DD type( P0.05), and meat percentage of BD genotype was significantly higher than that of AB, AD and DD genotype( P 0.05). Our data suggest that the SNPs of SIRT1 gene affect on the slaughter traits of LZ, LXZ, QC, XZ and XXZ cattle, and SIRT1 could be a candidate gene to direct beef cattle breeding.",,0
Opposing macroevolutionary and trait‐mediated patterns of threat and naturalisation in flowering plants,"Abstract Due to expanding global trade and movement of people, new plant species are establishing in exotic ranges at increasing rates while the number of native species facing extinction from multiple threats grows. Yet, how species losses and gains globally may, together, be linked to traits and macroevolutionary processes is poorly understood. Here, we show that, adjusting for diversification rate and clade age, the proportion of threatened species across flowering plant families is negatively related to the proportion of naturalised species per family. Moreover, naturalisation is positively associated with range size, short generation time, autonomous seed production and interspecific hybridisation, but negatively with age and diversification, whereas threat is negatively associated with range size and hybridisation, and positively with biotic pollination, age and diversification rate. That we find such a pronounced signature of naturalisation and threat across plant families suggests that both trait syndromes have coexisted over deep evolutionary time and counter to intuition, that neither strategy is necessarily superior to the other over long evolutionary timespans.",https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13740,0
The relationship between personality and bullying among primary school children: the mediation role of trait emotion intelligence and empathy,"Several studies have shown that personality traits are a benchmark in research field of bullying prevention, while others have highlighted that the socio-emotional skills are important to prevent a wide range of maladjusted behaviors, suggesting that the investment in their developing may mediate the effects of personality dispositions. The present study aims to clarify if socio-emotional attitudes can mediate the relationships between personality traits and bullying. Five sequential mediation models are tested using the Big Five personality traits as focal predictors, bullying as the outcome, and trait emotional intelligence and empathy as causally chained mediators, involving 199 primary school children (8-10 years) through the Bullying Prevalence Questionnaire, the Big Five Questionnaire for children, the Emotional Intelligence Index and the Empathy-Teen Conflict Survey. Data showed that openness, conscientiousness, and agreeableness were inversely related to bullying, and that the causal chain of TEI-empathy negatively and completely mediated the relationship between emotional instability and bullying and negatively and partially mediated the relationship between openness and bullying. These results suggest that TEI and empathy mediate the relationship between personality traits and bullying, reducing the risk of being involved in bullying perpetration.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2022.100359,0
Survey of the relationship between polymorphisms within the <i>BMPR1B</i> gene and sheep reproductive traits,"The BMPRIB gene is one of the main genes that can be used as a molecular genetic marker for the early selection of highly productive ewes. It is well-documented that the p.Q249R (g.746A > G) is the first mutation in the kinase domain of the BMPR1B gene that is highly related to increased ovulation rate and litter size. It is likely that the presence of the p.Q249R mutation in the sheep population is one of the factors contributing to the outstanding productivity of the sheep. Moreover, in recent years, researchers have been explored other polymorphisms in the BMPR1B gene with respect to reproductive traits in sheep. Therefore, we carried out the current study to evaluate the association between polymorphisms in this gene and sheep litter size from all appropriate studies. As a result, among 41 polymorphisms in the ovine BMPRIB gene, eight variants, including p.Q249R (g.746A > G), g.29362047T > C, g.29427689G > A, BMPR1B-2 (ss:1960972599), g.29382337G > A, g.29382340G > A, rs1092293287 (10 bp insertion/deletion) and g.29380965A > G were found to be associated with litter size in sheep. This systematic analysis presents the most current data evidence for BMPRIB polymorphisms, highlighting the need for further large-scale studies to determine more important variants.",https://doi.org/10.1080/10495398.2021.1979023,0
Herbivory of a biocontrol agent on a native plant causes an indirect trait‐mediated non‐target effect on a native insect,"Abstract Identifying food web linkages between biocontrol agents of invasive plants and native species is crucial for predicting indirect non‐target effects. Biocontrol insects can integrate into food webs within recipient habitats and influence native insects through apparent competition (altering shared natural enemies) or density‐mediated exploitation competition (changing density of native plants). However, whether and how trait‐mediated exploitation competition (modifying native plant chemicals and volatiles profiles) can produce indirect non‐target effects remains largely overlooked, despite plant phenotypic responses to insect herbivory being common and widely documented. The flea beetle Agasicles hygrophila was introduced into China for management of alligator weed Alternanthera philoxeroides, but it also attacks the native congener sessile joyweed Alternanthera sessilis, which may cause indirect non‐target effects on the native tortoise beetle Cassida piperata that also feeds on sessile joyweed. Here, we examined the relationships among abundances of the flea beetle and tortoise beetle, and coverage of sessile joyweed in the field. Then, we investigated the impact of flea beetle herbivory on tortoise beetle development and oviposition, as well as on sessile joyweed primary metabolites and leaf volatiles. Tortoise beetle abundance was not related to sessile joyweed coverage, but they were less abundant on plants with more flea beetles in the field survey, and produced fewer offspring on plants with more prior flea beetle damage in the field cage experiment. Tortoise beetle development was inhibited by prior flea beetle herbivory in bioassays in enemy‐free conditions and they preferred to oviposit on sessile joyweed that had experienced little or no flea beetle damage. Flea beetle herbivory decreased sessile joyweed foliar glucose and protein, and substantially changed its leaf volatile blend. Synthesis. Our results show that the flea beetle has major indirect non‐target effects on the tortoise beetle through trait‐mediated exploitation competition, rather than apparent competition or density‐mediated exploitation competition. Our results demonstrate a new example for indirect non‐target effects of biocontrol agents. Furthermore, our results indicate that minor brief negative impacts of biocontrol agents on non‐target plants might propagate to higher trophic levels and such negative impacts can strengthen with increasing intensity of the direct non‐target effect.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13676,0
"Impact of Genetic Polymorphisms of SLC2A2, SLC2A5, and KHK on Metabolic Phenotypes in Hypertensive Individuals","In the past few decades, consumption of added sugars has increased dramatically. Studies have linked high sugar intake with increased risk for a number of diseases. Importantly, fructose, a component of sugar, has been linked with the development of features of metabolic syndrome. This study determined if single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in fructose transport (solute carrier family 2 facilitated glucose transporter, member 2 (SLC2A2) and solute carrier family 2 facilitated glucose/fructose transporter, member 5 (SLC2A5)) and metabolism (ketohexokinase (KHK)) affect inter-individual variability in metabolic phenotypes, such as increased serum uric acid levels.The influence of SLC2A2, SLC2A5, and KHK SNPs on metabolic phenotypes was tested in 237 European Americans and 167 African Americans from the Pharmacogenomic Evaluation and Antihypertensive Responses (PEAR) study. Using baseline untreated fasting data, associations were considered significant if p≤0.005. These SNPs were then evaluated for potential replication (p≤0.05) using data from the Genetic Epidemiology of Responses to Antihypertensives (GERA) studies.SLC2A5 rs5438 was associated with an increase in serum uric acid in European American males. However, we were unable to replicate the association in GERA. The minor allele of SLC2A2 rs8192675 showed an association with lower high-density lipoproteins in European Americans (A/A: 51.0 mg/dL, A/G: 47.0 mg/dL, G/G: 41.5 mg/dL, p = 0.0034) in PEAR. The association between rs8192675 and lower high-density lipoproteins was replicated in the combined European American GERA study samples (A/A: 47.6 mg/dL, A/G: 48.6 mg/dL, G/G: 41.9 mg/dL, p = 0.0315).The association between SLC2A2 rs8192675 and high-density lipoproteins suggests the polymorphism may play a role in influencing high-density lipoproteins and thus metabolic risk of cardiovascular disease.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052062,0
ASSOCIATION OF GHRELIN GENE POLYMORPHISMS AND EXPRESSION LEVELS WITH SOME BIOCHEMICAL TRAITS IN BROILER CHICKENS,"This study was conducted to investigate the association of Ghrelin gene polymorphisms and expression levels with some biochemical traits of broiler chickens. Two hundred broiler chicks Ross308, one-day old were wing-tagged and reared under optimal conditions. Blood samples were collected individually from all birds on 21 and 35 days of age. Proventriculus was collected at 35 days of age from thirty birds of each of groups sorted according to growth rate for high, moderate and low to measure ghrelin gene expression by real-time RT-PCR. The serum traits of glucose, uric acid, cholesterol, triglyceride, high density lipoproteins (HDL), low density lipoproteins LDL, total protein, albumin, globulin, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were not influenced by ghrelin gene polymorphisms. While significant (P &lt; 0.01) differences were recorded among the three chicken groups with high, moderate and low ghrelin expression in serum glucose, uric acid, total protein, albumin, cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL, AST, ALT and ALP concentrations at 21 and 35 days of age which increased with increasing ghrelin gene expression. The PCR- RFLP technique revealed no significant differences between GG and LL genotypes of ghrelin gene in all biochemical traits at 21 and 35 days of age, whereas ghrelin gene expression had a significant effect on serum glucose, uric acid, total protein, albumin, cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL, AST,ALT and ALP.",https://doi.org/10.36103/ijas.v49i5.49,0
PCR-RFLP Analysis of Insulin-Like Growth Factor 2 Gene Polymorphisms in Two Commercial Broiler Chicken Strains (Cobb 500 and Hubbard F-15) and Their Associations with Performance Traits.,"The present research aimed to study the polymorphisms of the chicken insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) in two commercial broiler breeds (Cobb 500 and Hubbard F-15). In total, 300 avian blood samples were obtained. The genomic DNA was isolated using a fast salt-extraction technique. Moreover, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify 1146 bp fragments of the gene. The amplified fragments were subjected to restriction enzyme digestion using the HinfI endonuclease enzyme, and the digested products were separated on a 2% agarose gel. The findings indicated that there were two alleles T and C for the target locus, with frequencies of 73.3% and 26.7%, respectively. Three distinct genotype variations, TT, TC, and CC, were found, with genotype frequencies of 59.1%, 28.4%, and 12.5%, respectively. A test based on actual and anticipated frequencies of various genotypic variances of the IGF2 gene revealed that the divergence from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was not significant (",https://doi.org/10.22092/ari.2022.359894.2504,0
Association of complement factor H Y402H polymorphism with phenotype of neovascular age related macular degeneration in Israel.,"The Tyr402His variant of complement factor H (CFH) is associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in several populations. Our aim was to evaluate if this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with AMD in the Israeli population and see if it underlies heterogeneity in clinical manifestation and responses to photodynamic therapy (PDT), which characterize neovascular AMD (NVAMD).Genotyping for the Tyr402His variant was performed in 240 NVAMD patients (78.1+/-7 age range) and 118 controls (70.8+/-8.2 age range). Genotyping was correlated with clinical characteristics and treatment parameters in sequential 131 NVAMD patients who underwent PDT.TheTyr402His coding allele was associated with NVAMD in the Israeli population: odds ratio (OR)=1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.3-2.6; p=0.0002. Homozygosity for this variant was associated with an OR of 3.4 (95% CI: 1.7-6.8) for having AMD. There was no association among this SNP and age of onset of NVAMD, gender, neovascular lesion size, initial or final visual acuity, and number of PDT sessions required.In accordance with findings from the majority of previous study populations, the Tyr402His variant of CFH is associated with NVAMD in Israel. However, heterogeneity in clinical manifestations of NVAMD and in its response to PDT is not underlined by this CFH variant and may be accounted for by other genetic and environmental factors.",,0
Association Study of a Serotonin Receptor 2A Gene -1438A/G Polymorphism and Anxiety-Related Traits,"Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the -1438A/G polymorphism of serotonin receptor 2A (5HTR2A) and anxiety-related traits in Korean adolescent females. Methods A total of 174 Korean adolescent females were tested for the -1438A/G polymorphism of 5HTR2A using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. Anxiety-related traits were evaluated using the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) and the trait form of the Spielberg State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (T-STAI). Results There was no difference between the genotypes with respect to scores pertaining to anxiety-related traits. Although the G allele carriers (GG or AG genotype) scored lower on the psychological subscale of the ASI (4.76Â±3.00 vs 5.98Â±4.00, p=0.038), this difference was not significant after Bonferroni correction. Conclusion These findings suggest that the -1438A/G polymorphism of 5HTR2A might not be associated with anxiety sensitivity or trait anxiety.

Beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor haplotype/polymorphisms and asthma susceptibility and clinical phenotype in a Chinese Han population,"Association and linkage studies of beta₂-adrenergic receptor (beta₂AR) polymorphisms in relation to the expression of asthmatic phenotypes and immune regulatory mechanisms have shown inconsistent results. This study was designed to analyze the relationship of particular combinations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or haplotypes of the beta₂AR gene with bronchial asthma, bronchodilator response, and total IgE. By direct DNA sequencing, five SNPs (in positions -47, -20, 46, 79, and 252) of beta₂AR gene were determined and combined with haplotypes in 201 asthmatic patients and 276 normal controls recruited from the Chinese Han population. Significantly higher bronchodilator response was observed in patients with homozygotic genotype 46A/A (13.40 ± 3.48%), compared with those with homo-46G/G (7.25 ± 3.11%) and heterozygotes 46A/G (7.39 ± 3.14%), respectively (p < 0.0001). There was also a significant difference in bronchodilator response when beta₂AR haplotypes were analyzed (p = 0.003). From two common SNPs at positions 46A/G and 79C/G, we had determined three haplotypes that constructed six haplotype pairs. Comparison of the mean delta forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁) values for the six haplotype pairs showed significant difference. Subjects homozygous for 46A/79C (Arg16/Gln27) had the highest deltaFEV₁ (13.40 ± 3.48%) and those with 46G/79C (Gly16/Gln27) homozygote had the lowest (6.43 ± 0.55%). The two SNP haplotype pairs were significantly associated with delta FEV₁ (p < 0.0001). Significantly higher total IgE levels were found in patients with homozygotic carriers of 79C genotypes (p = 0.022) and homozygotic haplotype -47 T/-20 T/46 A/79 C/252 G (p < 0.0001). These results indicate that the manifestation of asthma might be affected by either an individual beta₂AR SNPs or beta₂AR haplotype.",https://doi.org/10.2500/aap.2010.31.3371,0
Fibrinogen and clot-related phenotypes determined by fibrinogen polymorphisms: Independent and IL-6-interactive associations,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) induces the expression of fibrinogen, and polymorphic variation within the fibrinogen genes is believed to alter the magnitude of this expression. The identification of the functional relevance of individual fibrinogen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has been hindered by the high linkage disequilibrium (LD) reported in the European fibrinogen gene locus. This study investigated two novel and 12 known fibrinogen SNPs of potential functional relevance, in 2010 Tswana individuals known to have low LD. We aimed to identify functional polymorphisms that contribute to clot-related phenotypes and total and γ' fibrinogen concentrations independently and through their interaction with IL-6, by taking advantage of the high fibrinogen and IL-6 concentrations and the low LD reported in black South Africans. Fibrinogen was significantly associated with IL-6, thereby mediating associations of IL-6 with clot formation and structure, although attenuating the association of IL-6 with clot lysis time. None of the common European fibrinogen haplotypes was present in this study population. Putative functional fibrinogen SNPs FGB–rs7439150, rs1800789 (–1420G/A) and rs1800787 (–148C/T) were significantly associated with fibrinogen concentration and altered clot properties, with several associations significantly influenced by IL-6 concentrations. The impact of harbouring several minor fibrinogen SNP alleles on the association of IL-6 and fibrinogen concentration was cumulative, with possession of each additional minor allele showing a stronger relationship of IL-6 with fibrinogen. This was also reflected in differences in clot properties, suggesting potential clinical relevance. Therefore, when investigating the effect of fibrinogen genetics on fibrinogen concentrations and CVD outcome, the possible interactions with modulating factors and the fact that SNP effects seem to be additive should be taken into account.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0187712,0
Association of FABP3 and LEPR gene polymorphisms with the drip loss trait of pork,"Drip loss is a major parameter for the quality of pork which affects the economic perspective of premium-meat in the world’s pork industry. It is clear that the fatty acid binding protein3 (FABP3) gene is related to oxidation and glucose utilization in muscles whereas the leptin receptors (LEPR) gene is related to energy balance, and both genes affect pork quality. The objective of this study was to analyze the genetic polymorphisms of FABP3 and LEPR genes associated with the drip loss trait of pork. Longissimus dorsi muscle samples were taken from a total of 1,114 commercial pigs including purebred Duroc and [(Duroc × Large White) × Landrace] × Duroc. DNA was extracted by the Chelex® method. Drip loss was measured by the bag method based on gravitational technique. The FABP3 and LEPR genes were genotyped by the PCR-RFLP technique. It was found that the FABP3 gene showed significant association with the drip loss trait. The genotypes GC and CC of [(Duroc × Large White) × Landrace] × Duroc had the lowest drip loss. The LEPR gene was also associated with the drip loss trait. The animals of genotype TT had the lowest drip loss in Duroc but the genotype AA had the lowest drip loss in [(Duroc × Large White) × Landrace] × Duroc. Furthermore, the interaction between FABP3 and LEPR significantly affected drip loss. The animals with genotypes GGTT, GCTT and CCTT had the lowest drip loss in Duroc whereas the animals with genotypes GCAA, CCAA, GGAA, CCTT, GCTT, and CCTA had the lowest drip loss in [(Duroc × Large White) × Landrace] × Duroc. These results indicated the importance of FABP3 and LEPR genes to be used for the marker-assisted selection for the improvement of pork quality.",,0
Association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms and milk production traits in buffalo,"The aim of this study was to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in buffaloes associated with milk yield and content, in addition to somatic cell scores based on the cross-species transferability of SNPs from cattle to buffalo.A total of 15,745 SNPs were analyzed, of which 1562 showed 1% significance and 4742 with 5% significance, which were associated for all traits studied.After application of Bonferroni's correction for multiple tests of the traits analyzed, we found 2 significant SNPs placed on cattle chromosomes BTA15 and BTA20, which are homologous to buffalo chromosomes BBU16 and BBU19, respectively.In this genome association study, we found several significant SNPs affecting buffalo milk production and quality.Furthermore, the use of the high-density bovine BeadChip was suitable for genomic analysis in buffaloes.Although extensive chromosome arm homology was described between cattle and buffalo, the exact chromosomal position of SNP ©FUNPEC-RP www.funpecrp.com.brGenetics and Molecular Research 13 (4): 10256-10268 (2014) GWAS for milk production traits in buffalo markers associated with these economically important traits in buffalo can be determined only through buffalo genome sequencing.",https://doi.org/10.4238/2014.december.4.20,0
DNA sequence polymorphisms within the bovine guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gs subunit alpha (Gsα)-encoding (GNAS) genomic imprinting domain are associated with performance traits,"Abstract Background Genes which are epigenetically regulated via genomic imprinting can be potential targets for artificial selection during animal breeding. Indeed, imprinted loci have been shown to underlie some important quantitative traits in domestic mammals, most notably muscle mass and fat deposition. In this candidate gene study, we have identified novel associations between six validated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning a 97.6 kb region within the bovine guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gs subunit alpha gene ( GNAS ) domain on bovine chromosome 13 and genetic merit for a range of performance traits in 848 progeny-tested Holstein-Friesian sires. The mammalian GNAS domain consists of a number of reciprocally-imprinted, alternatively-spliced genes which can play a major role in growth, development and disease in mice and humans. Based on the current annotation of the bovine GNAS domain, four of the SNPs analysed ( rs43101491, rs43101493, rs43101485 and rs43101486 ) were located upstream of the GNAS gene, while one SNP ( rs41694646 ) was located in the second intron of the GNAS gene. The final SNP ( rs41694656 ) was located in the first exon of transcripts encoding the putative bovine neuroendocrine-specific protein NESP55, resulting in an aspartic acid-to-asparagine amino acid substitution at amino acid position 192. Results SNP genotype-phenotype association analyses indicate that the single intronic GNAS SNP ( rs41694646 ) is associated ( P ≤ 0.05) with a range of performance traits including milk yield, milk protein yield, the content of fat and protein in milk, culled cow carcass weight and progeny carcass conformation, measures of animal body size, direct calving difficulty ( i.e. difficulty in calving due to the size of the calf) and gestation length. Association ( P ≤ 0.01) with direct calving difficulty ( i.e. due to calf size) and maternal calving difficulty ( i.e. due to the maternal pelvic width size) was also observed at the rs43101491 SNP. Following adjustment for multiple-testing, significant association ( q ≤ 0.05) remained between the rs41694646 SNP and four traits (animal stature, body depth, direct calving difficulty and milk yield) only. Notably, the single SNP in the bovine NESP55 gene ( rs41694656 ) was associated ( P ≤ 0.01) with somatic cell count--an often-cited indicator of resistance to mastitis and overall health status of the mammary system--and previous studies have demonstrated that the chromosomal region to where the GNAS domain maps underlies an important quantitative trait locus for this trait. This association, however, was not significant after adjustment for multiple testing. The three remaining SNPs assayed were not associated with any of the performance traits analysed in this study. Analysis of all pairwise linkage disequilibrium ( r 2 ) values suggests that most allele substitution effects for the assayed SNPs observed are independent. Finally, the polymorphic coding SNP in the putative bovine NESP55 gene was used to test the imprinting status of this gene across a range of foetal bovine tissues. Conclusions Previous studies in other mammalian species have shown that DNA sequence variation within the imprinted GNAS gene cluster contributes to several physiological and metabolic disorders, including obesity in humans and mice. Similarly, the results presented here indicate an important role for the imprinted GNAS cluster in underlying complex performance traits in cattle such as animal growth, calving, fertility and health. These findings suggest that GNAS domain-associated polymorphisms may serve as important genetic markers for future livestock breeding programs and support previous studies that candidate imprinted loci may act as molecular targets for the genetic improvement of agricultural populations. In addition, we present new evidence that the bovine NESP55 gene is epigenetically regulated as a maternally expressed imprinted gene in placental and intestinal tissues from 8-10 week old bovine foetuses.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2156-12-4,0
"Higher-order effects, continuous species interactions, and trait evolution shape microbial spatial dynamics","Abstract The assembly and maintenance of microbial diversity in natural communities, despite the abundance of toxin-based antagonistic interactions, presents major challenges for biological understanding. A common framework for investigating such antagonistic interactions involve cyclic dominance games with pairwise interactions. The incorporation of higher-order interactions in such models permits increased levels of microbial diversity, especially in communities where antibiotic producing, sensitive, and resistant strains co-exist. However, most such models involve a small number of discrete species, assume a notion of pure cyclic dominance, and focus on low mutation rate regimes, none of which well represents the highly interlinked, quickly evolving, and continuous nature of microbial phenotypic space. Here, we present an alternative vision of spatial dynamics for microbial communities based on antagonistic interactions—one in which a large number of species interact in continuous phenotypic space, are capable of rapid mutation, and engage in both direct and higher-order interactions mediated by production of and resistance to antibiotics. Focusing on toxin production, vulnerability, and inhibition among species, we observe highly divergent patterns of diversity and spatial community dynamics. We find that species interaction constraints (rather than mobility) best predict spatiotemporal disturbance regimes, whereas community formation time, mobility, and mutation size best explain patterns of diversity. We also report an intriguing relationship among community formation time, spatial disturbance regimes, and diversity dynamics. This relationship, which suggests that both higher-order interactions and rapid evolution are critical for the origin and maintenance of microbial diversity, has broad-ranging links to the maintenance of diversity in other systems. Significance Statement Persistently diverse microbial communities are one of biology’s great puzzles. Using a novel continuous trait space modeling framework that accommodates high mutation rates, elevated species richness, and direct and higher-order antagonistic species interactions, we find that two parameters characterizing mutation size and mobility best explain patterns of microbial diversity. Moreover, community formation time (the duration of the transient phase in community assembly) provides an unexpectedly clear guide to the diversity profiles of the resulting communities. These discoveries showcase how complex, antagonistic interactions mediated by the production of, inhibition of, and vulnerability to toxins (antibiotics) can shape microbial communities, allowing for extraordinarily high levels of diversity and temporal persistence.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.02.429382,0
Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms of Quail Melanocortin-3 Receptor(MC3R) Gene and Its Association Analysis with Growth and Slaughter Traits,"In present study,Shaweimate meat-type quails were used to analyze MC3R gene polymorphism by PCR-SSCP.The results indicated that there were 3 mutation sites:T46C、G73A and T62A,respectively in the quail population.The three mutations produced 6 genotypes of AA,BB,CC,AB,AC and BC;the frequency of A,B,C alleles for MC3R gene in laying quails was 0.429,0.335and 0.236.The statistics analysis results showed that the effect of the MC3R polymorphism on body weight of 2,3 and 5 weeks age was significant(P0.05).In addition,it had significant effects on weight before slaughtering and eviscerated weight(P0.05),and extremely significant effects on semi-eviscerated weight(P0.01).The results indicated that MC3R gene maybe the major gene or linked gene of body weight and slaughter traits in quails.",,0
Polymorphisms in the serotonin receptor gene HTR2A modulate disease severity and susceptibility for anxiety disorders but not depression and are associated with specific personality traits,"Serotonin (5HT) is a neurotransmitter which plays an eminent role in complex physiologic functions such as sleep, appetite, thermoregulation, pain perception, hormone secretion and sexual behaviour. Genetic studies could show an involvement of serotonin metabolism in human neuropsychiatric disorders and suggest a participation in etiopathogenesis of anxiety, depression and schizophrenia. We analyzed a sample of 150 caucasian patients suffering from anxiety disorders and 496 healthy controls, matched for age, sex and ethnicity. All patients were not related and had been treated in our anxiety outpatient department for agoraphobia, social or specific phobia (diagnosed according to ICD–10). Additionally each patient underwent tests for personality traits (TPQ, EPQ-RK). An association study candidate gene approach was used with 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the gene coding for the serotonin receptor–2A (HTR2A). We find evidence, that polymorphisms within the HTR2A-gene are associated with both higher occurence and severity of panic disorders. Additionally certain nucleotide polymorphisms show associations with psychometric test results of the personality traits psychoticism and reward dependence. Interestingly, the aforementioned genetic associations were not present in a population of 800 patients suffering from unipolar depression, suggesting an particular effect for anxiety-patients.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2005-918859,0
Attachment and Externalizing Behavior: Mediation through Dysfunctional Emotion Regulation and Callous-Unemotional Traits,"The aim of the current study was to investigate whether the association between parental attachment and externalizing behavior is parallelly mediated by dysfunctional emotion regulation and callous-unemotional traits. The community sample included 296 adolescents (Mage = 14.90, SDage = 1.31), who completed the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment, the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits, the Regulation of Emotions Questionnaire, and the Youth Self-Report Child Behavior Checklist. A mediation analysis revealed both direct and indirect effects. Secure attachment representations were negatively associated with internal- and external dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies and callous-unemotional traits, which in turn were positively associated with externalizing behavior problems. The current study expands previous research by simultaneously investigating familial and cognitive factors that foster externalizing behavior problems. An attachment-based perspective offers new possibilities for theory expansion, research directions, and the development of interventions.",https://doi.org/10.3233/dev-200291,0
Sensory-Processing Sensitivity and Pathways to Depression and Aggression: The Mediating Role of Trait Emotional Intelligence and Decision-Making Style—A Pilot Study,"While the link between sensory-processing sensitivity (SPS) and internalizing symptoms has been well-established, a link to externalizing problems is still to be explored. This study aimed to further examine the relation between SPS and behavioral problems by testing the potential mediating roles of trait emotional intelligence (TEI) and decision-making styles. Pathway analyses were conducted on data from 268 community sample participants (Mage = 25.81, SD = 2.41, 61.2% females). Results indicated gender differences in the pathway level outcomes of SPS, as well as potential partial mediators in men and women. SPS both directly and via the mediating effects of the well-being factor (TEI) and avoidant decision-making influenced depression, regardless of gender. Direct effects on aggression were, however, obtained only in the male sample. Indirect effects of SPS on aggression were found in spontaneous decision-making for men and in the self-control and sociability factors of TEI for women. Directions for future research were discussed.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182413202,0
Big Five personality traits and food waste reduction behaviors: the mediating roles of environmental concern and knowledge,"Purpose This study examines the influencing mechanism of Big Five personality traits on food reduct, reuse and recycle behaviors (3R) of young consumers through the mediating role of environmental concern and knowledge. Design/methodology/approach Data collected from a survey of 727 Generation Z consumers in Vietnam were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings The results of the study confirm the influence of Big Five personality traits on environmental concern and knowledge, and environmental concern and knowledge also have a positive impact on 3R. The mediating roles of environmental concern and knowledge are confirmed by the data of the research model. Based on the research results, the author makes some implications for managers in promoting food waste reduction behaviors of Generation Z. Research limitations/implications The direct relationship between the Big Five personality traits and food waste reduction behaviors was not confirmed in the research model. Practical implications Managers need to develop appropriate training and guidance at schools, at work and at home; need to promote through vivid media channels that Generation Z consumers often use, such as Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok…; and need to provide specific instructions on how to reduce, how to reuse and how to recycle. Originality/value First, it is the first study to examine the relationship between the Big Five personality traits and food waste reduction behaviors. Second, this is one of the few studies that examined the impact of the Big Five personality traits on environmental concern and environmental knowledge. Third, this is one of the first studies to comprehensively consider food waste reduction behaviors, especially in Generation Z.",https://doi.org/10.1108/meq-10-2024-0440,0
HLA polymorphisms in African Americans with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy: Allelic profiles distinguish patients with different clinical phenotypes and myositis autoantibodies,"To investigate possible associations of HLA polymorphisms with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) in African Americans, and to compare this with HLA associations in European American IIM patients with IIM.Molecular genetic analyses of HLA-A, B, Cw, DRB1, and DQA1 polymorphisms were performed in a large population of African American patients with IIM (n = 262) in whom the major clinical and autoantibody subgroups were represented. These data were compared with similar information previously obtained from European American patients with IIM (n = 571).In contrast to European American patients with IIM, African American patients with IIM, in particular those with polymyositis, had no strong disease associations with HLA alleles of the 8.1 ancestral haplotype; however, African Americans with dermatomyositis or with anti-Jo-1 autoantibodies shared the risk factor HLA-DRB1*0301 with European Americans. We detected novel HLA risk factors in African American patients with myositis overlap (DRB1*08) and in African American patients producing anti-signal recognition particle (DQA1*0102) and anti-Mi-2 autoantibodies (DRB1*0302). DRB1*0302 and the European American-, anti-Mi-2-associated risk factor DRB1*0701 were found to share a 4-amino-acid sequence motif, which was predicted by comparative homology analyses to have identical 3-dimensional orientations within the peptide-binding groove.These data demonstrate that North American IIM patients from different ethnic groups have both shared and distinct immunogenetic susceptibility factors, depending on the clinical phenotype. These findings, obtained from the largest cohort of North American minority patients with IIM studied to date, add additional support to the hypothesis that the myositis syndromes comprise multiple, distinct disease entities, perhaps arising from divergent pathogenic mechanisms and/or different gene-environment interactions.",https://doi.org/10.1002/art.22205,0
NOD2 Polymorphisms May Direct a Crohn Disease Phenotype in Patients With Very Early-Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"NOD2/CARD15 was the first susceptibility gene recognized for adult-onset Crohn’s (or Crohn) disease (CD). Recessive inheritance of NOD2 polymorphisms has been implicated as a mechanistic driver of pediatric-onset CD. In patients with very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD), however, the clinical relevance of NOD2 polymorphisms has not been fully established. Ten VEO-IBD patients with NOD2 polymorphisms ( NOD2 +) were compared to 16 VEO-IBD patients without genetic variants in NOD2 or any other VEO-IBD susceptibility genes ( NOD2 −). The majority of NOD2 + patients exhibited a CD-like phenotype (90%), linear growth impairment (90%), and arthropathy (60%), all of which were significantly more common than in the NOD2 − group ( P = 0.037, P = 0.004, P = 0.026, respectively). We propose that the presence of NOD2 polymorphisms in patients with VEO-IBD might confer a CD-like phenotype, linear growth impairment, and arthropathy. These findings should be validated in larger cohorts and may guide precision medicine for patients with VEO-IBD in the future.",https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0000000000003846,0
Personality Traits and Positive Resources of Workers for Sustainable Development: Is Emotional Intelligence a Mediator for Optimism and Hope?,"The 21st century is characterized by unpredictable and changing environments that require individuals and organizations to adapt to these challenges and prepare for continuous transitions in the work environment. Optimism and hope are positive resources that are key factors in navigating this post-modern work scenario. Emotional intelligence can be considered as another important variable in this context and furthermore, research has shown it can be increased through specific training. The aim of the present study is to examine the contribution of emotional intelligence in mediating the relationship between personality traits and both optimism and hope. The Big Five Questionnaire (BFQ), the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue-SF), the Life Orientation Test Revised (LOT-R), and the Hope Scale (HS) were administered to 201 Italian workers. Correlations among variables were calculated and mediation analyses were performed. The results showed that the relationships between personality traits and both optimism and hope are mediated by emotional intelligence. In particular, the contribution of emotional stability, agreeableness, and extraversion on optimism was mediated by emotional intelligence; the contribution of extraversion, emotional stability, and conscientiousness on hope was mediated by emotional intelligence. These results open new possibilities for research and interventions to enhance the personal resources of workers in the fluid scenario of the 21st century by promoting optimism and hope that are facilitated by emotional intelligence in the perspective of enhancing psychological aspects of sustainability and sustainable development.",https://doi.org/10.3390/su10103422,0
Microparticle‐associated nucleic acids mediate trait dominance in cancer,"Drug resistance is a major cause of cancer treatment failure, with multidrug resistance (MDR) being the most serious, whereby cancer cells display cross-resistance to structurally and functionally unrelated drugs. MDR is caused by overexpression of the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1). These transporters act to maintain sublethal intracellular drug concentrations within the cancer cell, making the population treatment unresponsive. Recently, we discovered a novel nongenetic basis to MDR whereby microparticles (MPs) transfer P-gp intercellularly from MDR donor cells to drug-sensitive recipient cells. MPs isolated from MDR leukemia and breast cancer cells were cocultured with their drug-sensitive counterparts. P-gp transfer was assessed by direct immunolabeling, and acquired transcripts and regulatory microRNAs by quantitative real-time PCR. We show that MDR MPs incorporate nucleic acids; MPs change recipient cells' transcriptional environment to reflect donor MDR phenotype, and distinct pathways exist among cancers of different origin that may be dependent on donor cells' ABCB1 overexpression. We demonstrate that this pathway exists for both hematological and nonhematological malignancies. By conferring MDR and ""retemplating"" the transcriptional landscape of recipient cells, MPs provide a novel pathway, having implications in the dissemination and acquisition of deleterious traits in clinical oncology.",https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.11-186817,0
Are Psychopathy Traits Related to the Use of Artificial Intelligence Tools? The Mediating Effect of Self-Control,"Introduction: Artificial Intelligence tools are nowadays highly accessible to the general population. They can be used for many purposes, from solving doubts to create fake content. Despite these tools are becoming increasingly prevalent, nothing is known about psychological features related to the use of Artificial Intelligence.Objective: To analyse if psychopathy traits are related to Artificial Intelligence use and whether this hypothetical relation is mediated by low levels of self-control.Method: This was a cross-sectional study involving 1761 participants with a mean age of 20.3 years (SD = 2.76). Psychopathy traits were measured using the PCL-R and the use of artificial intelligence tools was reported by a questionnaire ad hoc.Results: According to Pearson correlations, the use of artificial intelligence tools was more prevalent among participants scoring high in psychopathy traits and low in self-control. Mediation analyses showed that psychopathy traits predicted more use of artificial intelligence, the use of these tools to do academic works instead of the student and to create fake content. Moreover, self-control mediated the link between psychopathy traits and Artificial Intelligence use.Discussion: Currently, institutions are discussing the need of regulating Artificial Intelligence. These findings provide empirical information to create evidence-based regulations on the topic.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4715935,0

Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated Transformation of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveumis and Screening of Mutants with Special Traits,"In this study,Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.niveumis FO-11-06 was successfully transformed mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens,and T-DNA insertion mutants were further screened.The effects of pH and cultivation media on genetic transformation were studied under the condition of 25 ℃,1×106 spores/mL,A.tumefaciens(AGL1) OD600=0.15,200 μmol/L of acetosyringone and 48 h of co-cultivation in the presence of induction medium.The results showed that the transformants could be obtained in specific pH value range from 5.1 to 5.8 and the transformation efficiency reached the highest level at pH 5.3,with about 553 transformants per 106 spores.It also revealed that transformation efficiency was higher on cellophane(551 transformants per 106 spores) and NC millipore filter(549 transformants per 106 spores) compared to filter paper.Hygromycin resistance and PCR assay of the transformants showed that the T-DNA had been successfully integrated into the genome of F.oxysporum f.sp.niveumis FO-11-06.Forty six mutants with specific traits were identified from 1 989 transformants by assay of colony growth,colony color,and conidia output.The transformation system and mutants provided a basis for the study of development,pathogenicity mechanism and functional gene of the fungus.",,0
Do NeuroD Gene Polymorphisms Predict the Risk of Heroin Dependence or Mediate the Association between Personality Traits and Heroin Dependence?,"Objective:Heroin dependence (HD) affects brain development and is known to be heritable. The NeuroD gene encodes a neuroge nic differentiation factor, and its expression is essential for the development of the central nervous system. In this genetic case-control study, we aimed to investigate whether NeuroD gene polymorphisms associate with the occurrence of HD and the specific personality traits of patients with HD. Methods: 1107 unrelated participants (584 patients with HD and 523 controls) were recruited to the study The patients with HD were classified into six clinical subgroups based on their gender, duration, and age of onset to reduce heterogeneity. In total, 539 subjects completed the personality trait assessments. Results: We found a weak association between the NeuroD 1 rs16867467 locus and HD (p=0.048); this weak association was found only in the male (p=0.039) and late onset (p=0.047) HD subgroups. These findings could not be confirmed after haplotype analysis and Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons. Patients with HD had higher novelty seeking (NS) and harm avoidance (HA) scores than healthy subjects. However, none of the polymorphisms in the NeuroD gene affected the NS and HA scores in both patients and healthy subjects (p>0.05). A negative correlation was found between age and novelty seeking scores in both groups, suggesting novelty seeking personality trait as a risk factor for early-onset HD. Conclusion:This study suggests that the NeuroD gene may neither contribute to the risk of HD nor mediate the relationship between specific personality traits and HD.",https://doi.org/10.4172/neuropsychiatry.1000307,0
Analysis on Associations of Myopalladin Gene Polymorphisms with Carcass Traits in Pigs,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) were detected by RT-PCR amplification and sequencing on the EST(GenBank accession No.BM445313)which was expressed in porcine muscle.Two new SNPs were found and located in the 3′UTR region of Myopalladin gene by homologous comparative analysis in the non-redundant sequence database of NCBI through BLAST search.One of the SNPs was genotyped by RFLP with restriction enzyme Csp6I and used for association analysis with carcass traits in the SCAU-LL F2 pig resource population.The results showed that the average carcass lean meat percentage of CT and CC genotype were 46% and 45% respectively,and the average carcass skin fat percentage of the two genotype were 42% and 44% respectively,these differences were significant(P0.05).Therefore,it could be seen that porcine Myopalladin genotypes had significant influence on carcass traits,and might be considered as a potential genetic marker for selection.",,0
Polymorphism in Intron-I of Myostatin gene and its association with estimated breeding values of growth traits in Baluchi sheep (Ovis aries),"GDF8 gene is associated with skeletal muscle mass in farm animals. The association of GDF8 gene polymorphism with growth traits including birth weight, weaning weight, 6 months weight, 9 months weight and yearling weight in 112 individuals of superabundant sheep in Iran (Baluchi) was investigated. Polymerase chain reaction - single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) method was employed in screening for genetic variation. Three unique SSCP patterns (P1, P2 and P3) for intron1 region of GDF8 gene were observed. Breeding values of growth traits were estimated by using the best linear unbiased prediction based on an animal model with a relationship matrix. Studied growth traits were examined for association analysis. Our findings suggested that the P1 genotype has the highest body weight and the highest additive estimated breeding value for the weaning weight trait. Hence, the intron1 region of GDF8 variants could serve as a genetic marker for Baluchi sheep breeding and genetics. The other traits showed no relationship to the genotypes examined.",,0
The Association of ACTN3 Rs1815739 Polymorphism with Various Malocclusion Phenotype,"A functional polymorphism on the 16th exon of the alpha-actinin-3 gene has an effect on the protein structure and cellular signaling and therefore on muscle contraction. In this study, we aimed to analyze the alpha-actinin-3 rs1815739 polymorphism in 3-dimensional malocclusions and different craniofacial skeletal patterns.Forty-nine volunteering subjects enrolled for the study. Genotyping of alpha-actinin-3 rs1815739 polymorphism was per- formed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Pre-orthodontic cephalometric radiographs were traced using NemoTech ceph- alometric tracing software. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows was utilized to carry out statistical analysis. P < .05 was considered to be statistically significant.The respective numbers and the percentages of alpha-actinin-3 rs1815739 polymorphisms for RR, RX, and XX genotypes were 39 (79.6%), 4 (8.2%), and 6 (12.2%), respectively.

Personality Traits for a Social Mediator Robot Encouraging Elderly Self-Disclosure on Loss Experiences,"To prevent elderly people from being socially isolated, encouraging their self-disclosure takes an important role. We discuss a use case of social robots in which they are deployed as mediators for humans that intermediate remote communication between elderly people and their family members or friends. The goal of this article is to present a design guideline for such social mediator robots based on results obtained from two studies in which a total of 741 elderly people participated. In study 1, we explored topics in dialogues and found that a social mediator robot could well encourage the self-disclosure of the elderly people, particularly in topics of which they usually feel resistance in talking to others (e.g., loss experiences). Thus, we confirmed the feasibility of the social mediator robot. Study 2 pursued the effective personality traits of the social mediator robot. We re-investigated a well-studied research question of matching robot personality to the user. The results provided more detailed knowledge as to similarity-attraction/repulsion than had been reported previously.

Trait Anxiety and Social Media Fatigue: Fear of Missing Out as a Mediator,"Interdisciplinary literature indicates different correlates of social media fatigue (hereinafter: SMF). Some studies show that high levels of anxiety may induce lowered Internet use and lead social media users to withdraw from Internet activities. Since the relationship between anxiety and social media use is complex, it is important to investigate mediating factors that may indirectly contribute to or exacerbate this association. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to verify whether fear of missing out (hereinafter: FoMO) is a potential factor accounting for why anxiety is associated with SMF.The research was conducted on a group of 264 adolescents and adults (85% women). The mean age of the respondents was M = 23.76 with SD = 5.98 (range = 14-50 years). The data were collected via online social networking among college students, their family members and friends. The participants answered the Trait Anxiety Scale (TAS), Social Media Fatigue Scale (SMFS), Fear of Missing Out Scale (FoMO), and Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R).The outcomes showed that respondents with higher levels of trait anxiety report more intense cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and overall online fatigue. Concurrently, individuals who experience FoMO on the Internet declare being tired of social media use. Moreover, FoMO mediates the association between trait anxiety and all three dimensions of SMF, and its overall result.The present research increases our understanding of the possible role of apprehension related to missing out on the anxiety and fatigue connected to engagement in social media. It is possible to assess that trait anxiety might induce higher SMF when individuals experience a general apprehension that others are doing or having things that they do not.",https://doi.org/10.2147/prbm.s319379,0
Novel single nucleotide polymorphism in intron 4 of TGF-Î²3 gene and itâsassociation with production trait in Isfahan native fowl,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β3) belong to the large family multifunctional growth factors that have prominent role in growth and development and homeostasis tissues. The object of this study was to recognition of single nucleotide polymorphism at fourth intron of TGF-β3 gene and studies its association with breeding value of some production trait in Isfahan native fowl. The traits were included12-week body weight, age at first egg, egg number and average egg weight. Breeding value of these traits were used to study relationship between new mutations and traits. One hundred and forty blood samples were collected from randomly chosen pedigree herd of Isfahan native hens and the DNA extraction was conducted. Amplification conducted by PCR reaction after designing primers. The PCR products were sequenced. Markers were detected by align and compare sequenced PCR product with the sequence obtained from gene bank (accession number X60091).

Identification of a potential functional single nucleotide polymorphism for fatness and growth traits in the 3′-untranslated region of the PCSK1 gene in chickens1,"Prohormone convertase 1/3 is a serine endoprotease belonging to the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family that is encoded by the () gene, and its major function is the processing and bioactivation of the proproteins of many kinds of neuroendocrine hormones, including insulin, cholecystokinin, and adrenocorticotropic hormone. The results of our previous genomewide association study indicated that the gene might be an important candidate gene for fatness traits in chickens. The objectives of this study were to investigate the tissue expression profiles of gene and to identify functional variants associated with fatness and growth traits in the chicken. The results indicated that mRNA was widely expressed in various tissues, especially neuroendocrine and intestinal tissues. Of these 2 tissue types, mRNA expression in lean males was significantly higher than in fat males. A SNP in the 3' untranslated region of (c.*900G > A) was identified. Association analysis in the Arbor Acres commercial broiler population and Northeast Agricultural University broiler lines divergently selected for abdominal fat content (NEAUHLF) population showed that the SNP c.*900G > A was associated with abdominal fat weight, abdominal fat percentage, BW, metatarsus length, and metatarsal circumference. In the 5th to 19th generation (G to G) of NEAUHLF, the allele frequency of c.*900G > A changed along with selection for abdominal fat content. At G, allele G of c.*900G > A was predominate in the lean line, whereas allele A was predominate in the fat line. Functional analysis demonstrated that allele A of c.*900G > A reduced mRNA stability and consequently downregulated gene expression. These results suggested that c.*900G > A was a functional SNP for fatness and growth traits in the chicken. The results of this study provide basic molecular information for the role of gene in avian growth and development, especially obesity.",https://doi.org/10.2527/jas2017.1706,0
Associations between autistic-like traits and polymorphisms in NFKBIL1,"The immune system has been suggested to be associated with neuropsychiatric disorders; for example, elevated levels of cytokines and the inflammation-related transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) have been reported in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The aim of this study was to investigate possible associations between autistic-like traits (ALTs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NFKB1 (encoding a subunit of the NF-κB protein complex) and NF-κB inhibitor-like protein 1 (NFKBIL1).The study was conducted in a cohort from the general population: The Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS, n = 12 319, 9-12 years old). The subjects were assessed by the Autism-Tics, ADHD, and Other Comorbidities Inventory. Five SNPs within the two genes were genotyped (NFKBIL1: rs2857605, rs2239707, rs2230365 and rs2071592; NFKB1: rs4648022).We found significant associations for two SNPs in NFKBIL1: rs2239707 showed a significant distribution of genotype frequencies in the case-control analysis both for all individuals combined and in boys only, and rs2230365 was significantly associated with the ALTs-module language impairment in boys only. Furthermore, we found nominal association in the case-control study for rs2230365, replicating earlier association between this SNP and ASD in an independent genome-wide association study.The shown associations between polymorphisms in NFKBIL1 and ALTs are supporting an influence of the immune system on neuropsychiatric symptoms.",https://doi.org/10.1017/neu.2019.18,0
Coping as a mediator in the relationship between Trait emotional intelligence and adolescent stress,"Adolescents are the drivers of social change and transformation in any community. Their ability to deal with stressors will determine their well-being and ability to contribute to society. Thus, the present study assessed the relationship between trait emotional intelligence (Trait EI), coping styles, and adolescent stress. In particular, it investigated the role of coping styles as a mediator between Trait EI and adolescent stress. Three hundred fifty-seven adolescents studying in schools in Delhi participated in the study. The study revealed a significant association between Trait EI, coping styles, and adolescent stress. Furthermore, the mediation analysis revealed that the relationship between Trait EI and adolescent stress was partially mediated by emotion-oriented coping style. Task and avoidance-oriented coping did not act as mediators. The current findings have implications for psychologists, school counsellors, and mental health researchers involved in building stress management programs to nurture life skills among adolescents.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02673843.2023.2292070,0

Borderline personality traits mediate the relationship between negative life events and nonsuicidal self-injury in a clinical sample with youth depression,"Abstract Background Borderline personality traits play a significant role in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), particularly in depressed youths. NSSI is also highly correlated with negative life events. This research aimed to explore the connections between negative life events, borderline personality traits, and NSSI. Methods The study included 338 depressed youth aged 13 to 25 years. Self-reported measures and clinical interviews were utilized to evaluate the depressive symptoms, borderline personality traits, negative life events, and NSSI behaviours of these participants. Identifying variables linked to NSSI was the aim of our analysis, and we also conducted a mediation analysis to look into the influence of borderline traits on the connection between negative life events and NSSI. Results Of the 338 depressed youth, approximately 59.47% (201/338) displayed NSSI, which was associated with greater clinical severity. Borderline traits had an independent influence on NSSI and it partially explained the connection between negative life events and NSSI, even when accounting for depression symptoms. Depressed youth who were more vulnerable to NSSI behaviours often experienced negative life events such as interpersonal relationships, academic pressure, being punished, and loss. Conclusions Our research suggests that depressed youth who experience more negative life events are more likely to experience NSSI, and negative life events indirectly influence nonsuicidal self-injury through borderline personality traits. Implementing interventions focused on mitigating borderline symptoms could be a promising therapeutic approach for addressing NSSI in young people.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-024-05821-0,0

GLP-1R gene polymorphisms and metabolic traits during childhood and adolescence: The EPOCH study,"Abstract Aims/Hypothesis This is the first study to examine the association between variants of the glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor gene (GLP-1R) and metabolic characteristics among youth. We explored separate associations of three GLP-1R polymorphisms (rs10305420, rs6923761, and rs1042044) with BMI trajectories and markers of glucose-insulin homeostasis. Methods Mixed models examined associations between GLP-1R polymorphisms and trajectories of BMI. Linear models examined associations of GLP-1R polymorphisms with glucose and insulin concentrations across OGTT, insulin sensitivity (HOMA2-IR), insulin secretion (insulinogenic index and HOMA2-%B), and beta cell function (oral disposition index). Results Rs10305420 and rs6923761, but not rs1042044, were associated with growth and metabolic characteristics in early life. Rs6923761 genotype GG was associated with faster BMI growth velocity, when compared to carriers of the minor allele (difference in velocity [95% CI]: 0.16 kg/m2/year [0.07, 0.24] at age 10), which led to significantly higher average BMI by age 16 (average difference [95% CI]: 1.29 kg/m2 [0.22, 2.37]). Rs10305420 CC and rs6923761 GG genotypes had higher HOMA2-IR (β[95% CI]: 1.19%[1.06, 1.32] and 1.13%[1.01, 1.26], respectively) compared to minor allele carriers. Rs10305420 CC had higher HOMA2-%B (β[95% CI]: 1.09%[1.01, 1.17]), and higher stimulated insulin secretion at 30-minutes (β[95% CI]: 27.62 uIU/mL [3.00, 25.24]) and 120-minutes (β[95% CI]: 18.94 uIU/mL [1.04, 36.84), when compared to carriers of the minor allele. Conclusions GLP-1R polymorphisms were associated with faster BMI growth across development, and lower estimated insulin sensitivity and higher compensatory insulin secretion during adolescence. GLP-1R polymorphisms should be considered in future pediatric studies of genetic susceptibility for obesity and diabetes.",https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgae880,0

Novel polymorphisms of the PRKAG2 gene and their association with body measurement and meat quality traits in Qinchuan cattle,"Body measurement and meat quality traits play important roles in the evaluation of productivity and economy in cattle, which are influenced by genes and environmental factors.PRKAG2, which encodes the γ2 regulatory subunit of AMPK, is associated with key metabolic pathways in muscle.We detected bovine PRKAG2 gene polymorphisms and analyzed their associations with body measurement and meat quality traits of cattle.DNA samples were taken from 578 Qinchuan cattle aged 18-24 months.DNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, and timeof-flight mass spectrometry were used to detect PRKAG2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).Sequence analysis revealed three SNPs in exon 3 (g.95925G>A,g.95973G>C, and g.95992A>G) and ©FUNPEC-RP www.funpecrp.com.brGenetics and Molecular Research 14 (2): 3669-3679 (2015) one g.96058T>Cmutation in intron 3. g.95973G>C, g.95992A>G, and g.96058T>C each showed 3 genotypes: GG, GC, and CC; AA, AG, and GG; and TT, TC, and CC, respectively.In contrast, g.95925G>Aonly showed 2 genotypes, GG and GA.Analysis showed that g.95925G>A had no effects on body measurement and meat quality traits, whereas the other 3 polymorphisms were significantly associated with some of the body measurement and meat quality traits in the Qinchuan cattle population.It is inferred that the PRKAG2 gene can be used for markerassisted selection to improve the body measurement and meat quality traits in the Qinchuan cattle population.",https://doi.org/10.4238/2015.april.17.16,0
The polymorphisms of MyoD1 gene in Manych Merino sheep and its influence on body conformation traits,"Candidate genes associated with meat productivity often affect the performance of myostatin and muscle development in general. The MyoD1 gene is a member of the myogenic regulatory factor (MRF) family and plays a key role in the differentiation of skeletal muscle cells in vertebrates. We investigated the structure of the MyoD1 gene. The effect of polymorphisms on meat production was studied in the Russian sheep breed Manych Merino. To detect alleles, we used NimbleGen sequencing technology (Roche, USA). In the Manych Merino breed, we found 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with substitutions, all in the second exon, namely, c.244C&gt;T, c.246G&gt;T, c.253G&gt;T, c.259G&gt;C, c.261C&gt;T, c.269C&gt;G, c.274C&gt;A, c.276C&gt;G, c.277C&gt;A, c.279C&gt;T, c.281C&gt;A, c.287C&gt;A, c.325T&gt;C, and c.483C&gt;T. All of these SNPs, except from c.325T&gt;C, were detected here for the first time. The Manych Merino breed had 13 substitutions that were present as homozygous type. Only SNP c.325T&gt;C occurred as the wild type of homozygotes and heterozygotes in the ratio 2:1. We found that SNP c.325T&gt;C was associated with some vital body parameters, including parameters of height and croup measurement. Thus, the determination of allelic variants of the MyoD1 gene may be used in marker assisted genetic selection schemes.",https://doi.org/10.12681/jhvms.15476,0
