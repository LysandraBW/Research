"Quantitative Trait Loci for Flowering, Plant and Ear Height, and Kernel Traits in Maize","The inheritance of quantitative traits is not well understood. A study was conducted to determine the number and chromosomal locations of quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling male anthesis date; plant and ear height; kernel weight; and kernel protein, oil, and starch concentration in maize ( Zea mays L.). Two hundred S 1 lines were derived from a single F 1 plant from a cross of Illinois High Oil (IHO) by lllinois Low Oil (Early Maturity) [ILO(EM)]. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was performed to determine RFLP genotypes of the 200 S 1 families at 80 polymorphic loci spaced on average 24 centimorgans throughout the genome. The 200 S 1 families were measured for phenotypic traits in replicated field trials during 1992 and 1993. Analysis of variance detected significant ( P &lt; 0.05) associations between several RFLP loci and each phenotypic trait. A total of 16 marker loci clustered in eight chromosomal regions were significantly associated with male anthesis date, 18 marker loci clustered in II regions were significantly associated with plant height, 14 marker loci clustered in nine regions were significantly associated with ear height, 27 marker loci clustered in II regions were associated with kernel weight, 16 marker loci clustered in eight regions were associated with protein concentration, 31 marker loci clustered in II regions were associated with oil concentration, and 28 marker loci clustered in 13 regions were associated with starch concentration. A number of QTL were detected in chromosomal regions where known gene loci of biological relevance are located.",https://doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1995.0011183x003500060004x,1
Root phenotypes of young wheat plants grown in controlled environments show inconsistent correlation with mature root traits in the field,"Abstract Using a field to lab approach, mature deep-rooting traits in wheat were correlated to root phenotypes measured on young plants from controlled conditions. Mature deep-rooting root traits of 20 wheat genotypes at maturity were established via coring in three field trials across 2 years. Field traits were correlated to phenotypes expressed by the 20 genotypes after growth in four commonly used lab screens: (i) soil tubes for root emergence, elongation, length, and branching at four ages to 34 days after sowing (DAS); (ii) paper pouches 7 DAS and (iii) agar chambers for primary root (PR) number and angles at 8 DAS; and (iv) soil baskets for PR and nodal root (NR) number and angle at 42 DAS. Correlations between lab and field root traits (r2=0.45–0.73) were highly inconsistent, with many traits uncorrelated and no one lab phenotype correlating similarly across three field experiments. Phenotypes most positively associated with deep field roots were: longest PR and NR axiles from the soil tube screen at 20 DAS; and narrow PR angle and wide NR angle from soil baskets at 42 DAS. Paper and agar PR angles were positively and significantly correlated to each other, but only wide outer PRs in the paper screen correlated positively to shallower field root traits. NR phenotypes in soil baskets were not predicted by PR phenotypes in any screen, suggesting independent developmental controls and value in measuring both root types in lab screens. Strong temporal and edaphic effects on mature root traits, and a lack of understanding of root trait changes during plant development, are major challenges in creating controlled-environment root screens for mature root traits in the field.",https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eraa201,1
Breed differences and genetic parameters for body composition traits in beef cattle,"The recent scientific literature was reviewed to summarize breed differences and genetic parameters for carcass traits in beef cattle. Heritability estimates were generally moderate to large, suggesting good potential for accurate genetic selection for a given individual carcass characteristic. However, effectiveness of multiple-trait selection for some trait combinations could be slowed by genetic antagonisms between traits, suggesting the use of terminal breeding systems with complementary sire and dam genetic types. Individual and maternal heterosis estimates from age-constant analyses were numerically positive for most carcass traits, although estimates from weight-constant analyses were generally nonsignificant. Potential contributions to improved carcass composition from crossbreeding would primarily result from genetic complementarity rather than heterosis. Considerable variation exists between breeds for body composition, and breed rankings vary across different traits. Studies have consistently indicated reduced meat tenderness for Bos indicus compared with Bos taurus breeds. Some differences in breed rankings for marbling vs tenderness were noted. If the U.S. beef industry shifts toward a more value-based marketing system, some genetic concerns will include 1) an apparent antagonistic relationship between marbling and cutability across breeds and within some breeds, 2) inconsistency of beef tenderness, particularly in Bos indicus cattle, 3) the effect of increased leanness on female reproductive performance, and 4) the extent to which terminal breeding systems can be used.",https://doi.org/10.2527/1994.72102745x,1
"Adjustments and coordination of hydraulic, leaf and stem traits along a water availability gradient","Trait variability in space and time allows plants to adjust to changing environmental conditions. However, we know little about how this variability is distributed and coordinated at different organizational levels. For six dominant tree species in northeastern Spain (three Fagaceae and three Pinaceae) we quantified the inter- and intraspecific variability of a set of traits along a water availability gradient. We measured leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf nitrogen (N) concentration, carbon isotope composition in leaves (δ13 C), stem wood density, the Huber value (Hv, the ratio of cross-sectional sapwood area to leaf area), sapwood-specific and leaf-specific stem hydraulic conductivity, vulnerability to xylem embolism (P50 ) and the turgor loss point (Ptlp ). Differences between families explained the largest amount of variability for most traits, although intraspecific variability was also relevant. Species occupying wetter sites showed higher N, P50 and Ptlp, and lower LMA, δ13 C and Hv. However, when trait relationships with water availability were assessed within species they held only for Hv and Ptlp. Overall, our results indicate that intraspecific adjustments along the water availability gradient relied primarily on changes in resource allocation between sapwood and leaf area and in leaf water relations.",https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.15684,1
Quantitative Trait Linkage Analysis of Lipid-Related Traits in Familial Type 2 Diabetes,"Macrovascular disease is a major complication of type 2 diabetes. Epidemiological data suggest that the risk of macrovascular complications may predate the onset of hyperglycemia. Hypertriglyceridemia, low levels of HDL cholesterol, and an atherogenic profile characterize the insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome that is also prevalent among nondiabetic members of familial type 2 diabetic kindreds. To identify the genes for lipid-related traits, we first performed a 10-cM genome scan using 440 markers in 379 members of 19 multiplex families ascertained for two diabetic siblings (screening study). We then extended findings for three regions with initial logarithm of odds (LOD) scores &amp;gt;1.5 to an additional 23 families, for a total of 576 genotyped individuals (extended study). We found heritabilities for all lipid measures in the range of 0.31 to 0.52, similar to those reported by others in unselected families. However, we found the strongest evidence for linkage of triglyceride levels to chromosome 19q13.2, very close to the ApoC2/ApoE/ApoC1/ApoC4 gene cluster (LOD 2.56) in the screening study; the LOD increased to 3.16 in the extended study. Triglyceride-to-HDL cholesterol ratios showed slightly lower LOD scores (2.73, extended family) in this same location. Other regions with LOD scores &amp;gt;2.0 included HDL linkage to chromosome 1q21-q23, where susceptibility loci for both familial type 2 diabetes and familial combined hyperlipidemia have been mapped, and to chromosome 2q in the region of the NIDDM1 locus. Neither region showed stronger evidence for linkage in the extended studies, however. Our results suggest that genes in or near the ApoE/ApoC2/ApoC1/ApoC4 cluster on 19q13.2 may contribute to the commonly observed hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL seen in diabetic family members and their offspring, and thus may be a candidate locus for the insulin resistance syndrome.",https://doi.org/10.2337/diabetes.51.2.528,1
"Age, Comorbidities, and AIDS Predict a Frailty Phenotype in Men Who Have Sex With Men","Background.Adults aging with HIV infection are at risk for age-related comorbidities and syndromes, such as frailty. The objective of this study was to evaluate the expression and predictors of the frailty phenotype (FP) among HIV-infected (HIV+) and HIV-uninfected (HIV−) men who have sex with men.",https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glt148,1
Field evidence of trait‐mediated indirect interactions in a rocky intertidal food web,"Studies on the implications of food web interactions to community structure have often focused on density‐mediated interactions between predators and their prey. This approach emphasizes the importance of predator regulation of prey density via consumption (i.e. lethal effects), which, in turn, leads to cascading effects on the prey’s resources. A more recent and contrasting view emphasizes the importance of non‐lethal predator effects on prey traits (e.g. behaviour, morphology), or trait‐mediated interactions. On rocky intertidal shores in New England, green crab ( Carcinus maenas ) predation is thought to be important to patterns of algal abundance and diversity by regulating the density of herbivorous snails ( Littorina littorea ). We found, however, that risk cues from green crabs can dramatically suppress snail grazing, with large effects on fucoid algal communities. Our results suggest that predator‐induced changes in prey behaviour may be an important and under‐appreciated component of food web interactions and community dynamics on rocky intertidal shores.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1461-0248.2002.00304.x,1
Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for quality traits related to protein and starch in wheat,"Quality traits in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were studied by quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, a set of 131 lines derived from Chuan 35050 × Shannong 483 cross (ChSh). Grains from RILs were assayed for 21 quality traits related to protein and starch. A total of 35 putative QTLs for 19 traits with a single QTL explaining 7.99–40.52% of phenotypic variations were detected on 10 chromosomes, 1D, 2A, 2D, 3B, 3D, 5A, 6A, 6B, 6D, and 7B. The additive effects of 30 QTLs were positive, contributed by Chuan 35050, the remaining 5 QTLs were negative with the additive effect contributed by Shannong 483. For protein traits, 15 QTLs were obtained and most of them were located on chromosomes 1D, 3B and 6D, while 20 QTLs for starch traits were detected and most of them were located on chromosomes 3D, 6B and 7B. Only 7 QTLs for protein and starch traits were co-located in three regions on chromosomes 1D, 2A and 2D. These protein and starch trait QTLs showed a distinct distribution pattern in certain regions and chromosomes. Twenty-two QTLs were clustered in 6 regions of 5 chromosomes. Two QTL clusters for protein traits were located on chromosomes 1D and 3B, respectively, three clusters for starch traits on chromosomes 3D, 6B and 7B, and one cluster including protein and starch traits on chromosome 1D.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnsc.2007.12.013,1
Altered imprinted gene methylation and expression in completely ES cell-derived mouse fetuses: association with aberrant phenotypes,"In vitro manipulation of preimplantation mammalian embryos can influence differentiation and growth at later stages of development. In the mouse, culture of embryonic stem (ES) cells affects their totipotency and may give rise to fetal abnormalities. To investigate whether this is associated with epigenetic alterations in imprinted genes, we analysed two maternally expressed genes (Igf2r, H19) and two paternally expressed genes (Igf2, U2af1-rs1) in ES cells and in completely ES cell-derived fetuses. Altered allelic methylation patterns were detected in all four genes, and these were consistently associated with allelic changes in gene expression. All the methylation changes that had arisen in the ES cells persisted on in vivo differentiation to fetal stages. Alterations included loss of methylation with biallelic expression of U2af1-rs1, maternal methylation and predominantly maternal expression of Igf2, and biallelic methylation and expression of Igf2r. In many of the ES fetuses, the levels of H19 expression were strongly reduced, and this biallelic repression was associated with biallellic methylation of the H19 upstream region. Surprisingly, biallelic H19 repression was not associated with equal levels of Igf2 expression from both parental chromosomes, but rather with a strong activation of the maternal Igf2 allele. ES fetuses derived from two of the four ES lines appeared developmentally compromised, with polyhydramnios, poor mandible development and interstitial bleeding and, in chimeric fetuses, the degree of chimerism correlated with increased fetal mass. Our study establishes a model for how early embryonic epigenetic alterations in imprinted genes persist to later developmental stages, and are associated with aberrant phenotypes.",https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.125.12.2273,1
Trait bandwidth and stages of job performance: Assessing differential effects for conscientiousness and its subtraits.,"This study examined relationships with job performance at different stages of employee tenure for a broad personality measure (conscientiousness) and 2 more narrow subtraits (order and achievement). Conscientiousness exhibited a consistent relationship with performance for employees in both the transition stage (newly hired employees) and the maintenance stage (veteran employees). In contrast, the more narrow subtraits exhibited differential relationships. Order correlated more strongly with performance in the transition stage, whereas achievement correlated more strongly in the maintenance stage. In the respective samples, order and achievement also provided incremental validity beyond conscientiousness.",https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.84.6.959,1
"Influence of Bulk and Nanoparticles Titanium Foliar Application on some Agronomic Traits, Seed Gluten and Starch Contents of Wheat Subjected to Water Deficit Stress","Titanium (Ti) is a very interesting chemical element, especially physiologically. Although Ti is not toxic for animals and humans, its effects on plants show remarkable concentration dependence. Whereas for plants, it shows beneficial effects on various physiological parameters at low doses. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of bulk and nanoparticles titanium foliar. Application on some agronomic traits, seed gluten and starch contents of wheat under water deficit stress conditions during 2010-2011 growing seasons. The experimental design was randomized in complete blocks arranged in split-split plots with four replications. The factors included normal irrigation, water deficit stress (irrigation withholding at two growing stages of stem elongation and flowering), two growing stages for water deficit stress induction and titanium applications, five titanium concentrations, sources including control of titanium oxide (bulk), and three concentrations of 0.01%, 0.02%, and 0.03% of titanium dioxide nanoparticles. Plant height, ear weight, ear number, seed number, 1000-seed weight, final yield, biomass, harvest index, gluten, and starch contents were assayed. The results showed that water deficit stress caused significant decrease in plant growth, yield and yield components. In addition, among the different titanium treatments, titanium dioxide nanoparticles at 0.02% increased almost all agronomic traits including gluten and starch content. Thus, the application of titanium dioxide nanoparticles under conditions of water deficit stress is recommended.",https://doi.org/10.15835/nbha4119093,1
Personality development from 12 to 18 years of age: changes in mean levels and structure of traits,"The Estonian NEO‐FFI was administered to 2650 Estonian adolescents (1420 girls and 1230 boys) aged from 12 to 18 years and attending 6th, 8th, 10th, or 12th grade at secondary schools all over Estonia. Although the mean levels of personality traits of Estonian adolescents were quite similar to the respective scores of Estonian adults, there was a developmental gap in Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Three of the five personality dispositions demonstrated a modest cross‐sectional change in the mean level of the trait scores: the level of Openness increased and the levels of Agreeableness and Conscientiousness decreased between 12 and 18 years of age. Although the five‐factor structure of personality was already recognizable in the sample of 12‐year‐old children, it demonstrated only an approximate congruence with the adult structure, suggesting that not all children of that age have developed abilities required for observing one's own personality dispositions and for giving reliable self‐reports on the basis of these observations. The self‐reported personality trait structure matures and becomes sufficiently differentiated around age 14–15 and grows to be practically indistinguishable from adult personality by the age of 16. Personality of adolescents becomes more differentiated with age: along with the growth of mental capacities the correlations among the personality traits and intelligence become smaller.

New alleles in calpastatin gene are associated with meat quality traits in pigs1,"Suggestive QTL affecting raw firmness scores and average Instron force, tenderness, juiciness, and chewiness on cooked meat were mapped to pig chromosome 2 using a three-generation intercross between Berkshire and Yorkshire pigs. Based on its function and location, the calpastatin (CAST) gene was considered to be a good candidate for the observed effects. Several missense and silent mutations were identified in CAST and haplotypes covering most of the coding region were constructed and used for association analyses with meat quality traits. Results demonstrated that one CAST haplotype was significantly associated with lower Instron force and cooking loss and higher juiciness and, therefore, this haplotype is associated with higher eating quality. Some of the sequence variation identified may be associated with differences in phosphorylation of CAST by adenosine cyclic 3′, 5′-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase and may in turn explain the meat quality phenotypic differences. The beneficial haplotype was present in all the commercial breeds tested and may provide significant improvements for the pig industry and consumers because it can be used in marker-assisted selection to produce naturally tender and juicy pork without additional processing steps.",https://doi.org/10.2527/2004.82102829x,1
Phenotype of arylsulfatase A-deficient mice: Relationship to human metachromatic leukodystrophy,"Metachromatic leukodystrophy is a lysosomal sphingolipid storage disorder caused by the deficiency of arylsulfatase A. The disease is characterized by progressive demyelination, causing various neurologic symptoms. Since no naturally occurring animal model of the disease is available, we have generated arylsulfatase A-deficient mice. Deficient animals store the sphingolipid cerebroside-3-sulfate in various neuronal and nonneuronal tissues. The storage pattern is comparable to that of affected humans, but gross defects of white matter were not observed up to the age of 2 years. A reduction of axonal cross-sectional area and an astrogliosis were observed in 1-year-old mice; activation of microglia started at 1 year and was generalized at 2 years. Purkinje cell dendrites show an altered morphology. In the acoustic ganglion numbers of neurons and myelinated fibers are severely decreased, which is accompanied by a loss of brainstem auditory-evoked potentials. Neurologic examination reveals significant impairment of neuromotor coordination.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.93.25.14821,0
Parkinson Phenotype in Aged PINK1-Deficient Mice Is Accompanied by Progressive Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Absence of Neurodegeneration,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is an adult-onset movement disorder of largely unknown etiology. We have previously shown that loss-of-function mutations of the mitochondrial protein kinase PINK1 (PTEN induced putative kinase 1) cause the recessive PARK6 variant of PD.Now we generated a PINK1 deficient mouse and observed several novel phenotypes: A progressive reduction of weight and of locomotor activity selectively for spontaneous movements occurred at old age. As in PD, abnormal dopamine levels in the aged nigrostriatal projection accompanied the reduced movements. Possibly in line with the PARK6 syndrome but in contrast to sporadic PD, a reduced lifespan, dysfunction of brainstem and sympathetic nerves, visible aggregates of alpha-synuclein within Lewy bodies or nigrostriatal neurodegeneration were not present in aged PINK1-deficient mice. However, we demonstrate PINK1 mutant mice to exhibit a progressive reduction in mitochondrial preprotein import correlating with defects of core mitochondrial functions like ATP-generation and respiration. In contrast to the strong effect of PINK1 on mitochondrial dynamics in Drosophila melanogaster and in spite of reduced expression of fission factor Mtp18, we show reduced fission and increased aggregation of mitochondria only under stress in PINK1-deficient mouse neurons.Thus, aging Pink1(-/-) mice show increasing mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in impaired neural activity similar to PD, in absence of overt neuronal death.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005777,0
Reduction of ER stress via a chemical chaperone prevents disease phenotypes in a mouse model of primary open angle glaucoma,"An investigation by the University Health Network recently found that portions of the RT-PCR gels shown in Figure 1, B (PGK-1 panel) and C (FGFR1 panel), are duplicated in this publication and in a subsequent publication (1).The samples were labeled differently in the panels, and the marker was shifted in Figure 1B.The corresponding author has indicated that other data from the initial screen of these samples support the conclusions made in the paper; however, the original data for the RT-PCR gels shown in Figure 1 are no longer available.The JCI's policies prohibit data manipulation and data duplication.Therefore, the JCI is retracting this article.No issues have been raised in regard to any of the other data in this manuscript.",https://doi.org/10.1172/jci82799,0
HykGene: a hybrid approach for selecting marker genes for phenotype classification using microarray gene expression data,Motivation: Recent studies have shown that microarray gene expression data are useful for phenotype classification of many diseases. A major problem in this classification is that the number of features (genes) greatly exceeds the number of instances (tissue samples). It has been shown that selecting a small set of informative genes can lead to improved classification accuracy. Many approaches have been proposed for this gene selection problem. Most of the previous gene ranking methods typically select 50–200 top-ranked genes and these genes are often highly correlated. Our goal is to select a small set of non-redundant marker genes that are most relevant for the classification task.,https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bti192,0
Correlations Between Species Traits and Allozyme Diversity: Implications for Conservation Biology,"Abstract One goal of conservation biology is to preserve the evolutionary potential of species by maintaining natural levels of genetic diversity. Knowledge of the levels and distribution of genetic variation thus becomes a prerequisite for the establishment of effective and efficient conservation practices (Beardmore 1983; Frankel 1983; Allendorf and Leary 1986). Without such knowledge, the efforts of conservation biologists, no matter how well meaning, may not be effective (Asins and Carbonell 1987). For conservation purposes, information can best be obtained by empirically determining the level and distribution of genetic variation for morphometric and physiological traits, allozyme loci, and DNA sequences. However, since few endangered species have been studied, and since the resources for such studies are frequently limited, we must often rely on previously accumulated knowledge to make educated guesses pertaining to the genetic diversity of these species.",https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780195064292.003.0005,0
Epigenetics and inheritance of phenotype variation in livestock,"Epigenetic inheritance plays a crucial role in many biological processes, such as gene expression in early embryo development, imprinting and the silencing of transposons. It has recently been established that epigenetic effects can be inherited from one generation to the next. Here, we review examples of epigenetic mechanisms governing animal phenotype and behaviour, and we discuss the importance of these findings in respect to animal studies, and livestock in general. Epigenetic parameters orchestrating transgenerational effects, as well as heritable disorders, and the often-overlooked areas of livestock immunity and stress, are also discussed. We highlight the importance of nutrition and how it is linked to epigenetic alteration. Finally, we describe how our understanding of epigenetics is underpinning the latest cancer research and how this can be translated into directed efforts to improve animal health and welfare.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13072-016-0081-5,0
"A longitudinal study of the effects of pessimism, trait anxiety, and life stress on depressive symptoms in middle-aged women.","The relative contributions of life stress, menopausal status, and pessimism and trait anxiety during the presence and absence of stress on increases in depressive symptoms across 3 years were examined in a sample of 460 premenopausal women, aged 42-50, who had few depressive symptoms at study entry. Multivariate analyses showed that after statistical adjustments for initial depressive symptoms and education, depressive symptoms at follow-up were higher among women (a) who reported stressful events, especially of a chronic nature, (b) who scored highly on trait anxiety, and (c) who were pessimistic and subsequently experienced a stressful ongoing problem. Change in menopausal status was not related to symptoms. The study confirms that midlife stress and both optimism and trait anxiety are important predictors of depressive symptoms during midlife.",https://doi.org/10.1037//0882-7974.11.2.207,0
Inhibition of GSK3β-mediated BACE1 expression reduces Alzheimer-associated phenotypes,"Deposition of amyloid β protein (Aβ) to form neuritic plaques in the brain is the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Aβ is generated from sequential cleavages of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the β- and γ-secretases, and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the β-secretase essential for Aβ generation. Previous studies have indicated that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) may play a role in APP processing by modulating γ-secretase activity, thereby facilitating Aβ production. There are two highly conserved isoforms of GSK3: GSK3α and GSK3β. We now report that specific inhibition of GSK3β, but not GSK3α, reduced BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP and Aβ production by decreasing BACE1 gene transcription and expression. The regulation of BACE1 gene expression by GSK3β was dependent on NF-κB signaling. Inhibition of GSK3 signaling markedly reduced Aβ deposition and neuritic plaque formation, and rescued memory deficits in the double transgenic AD model mice. These data provide evidence for regulation of BACE1 expression and AD pathogenesis by GSK3β and that inhibition of GSK3 signaling can reduce Aβ neuropathology and alleviate memory deficits in AD model mice. Our study suggests that interventions that specifically target the β-isoform of GSK3 may be a safe and effective approach for treating AD.",https://doi.org/10.1172/jci64516,0
CLC‐3 deficiency leads to phenotypes similar to human neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis,"Abstract Background : CLC‐3 is a member of the CLC chloride channel family and is widely expressed in mammalian tissues. To determine the physiological role of CLC‐3, we generated CLC‐3‐deficient mice ( Clcn3 –/– ) by targeted gene disruption. Results : Together with developmental retardation and higher mortality, the Clcn3 –/– mice showed neurological manifestations such as blindness, motor coordination deficit, and spontaneous hyperlocomotion. In histological analysis, the Clcn3 –/– mice showed a pattern of progressive degeneration of the retina, hippocampus and ileal mucosa, which resembled the phenotype observed in cathepsin D knockout mice. The defect of cathepsin D results in a lysosomal accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin containing the mitochondrial F1F0 ATPase subunit c. In immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis, we found that the subunit c was heavily accumulated in the lysosome of Clcn3 –/– mice. Furthermore, we detected an elevation in the endosomal pH of the Clcn3 –/– mice. Conclusions : These results indicated that the neurodegeneration observed in the Clcn3 –/– mice was caused by an abnormality in the machinery which degrades the cellular protein and was associated with the phenotype of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). The elevated endosomal pH could be an important factor in the pathogenesis of NCL.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2443.2002.00539.x,0
Ecological and evolutionary determinants of a key plant functional trait: wood density and its community‐wide variation across latitude and elevation,"Wood density is an important trait in trees indicative of their life history and mechanical and physiological strategies. The following examines the evolutionary ecology of wood density using a large database for seed plants. In particular, we focused on the geographic and phylogenetic variation in wood density for both gymnosperms and angiosperms. A phylogenetic supertree was constructed for over 4600 taxa, allowing for comprehensive analyses of divergences across the seed plant phylogeny. Community‐wide means and variances for wood densities were quantified for 171 standardized forest communities. Wood density was generally highly conserved across the entire seed plant phylogeny, yet large divergences were found within the rosid clade. Geographic and community variation in wood density, however, was significantly lower in temperate and high elevation communities, dominated by gymnosperms, than in tropical lowland communities, dominated by angiosperms, suggesting an increase in trait and, to some extent, clade filtering with latitude and elevation. Together, our results support the notion that both biotic and abiotic forces have been important in the evolution of wood density as well as in controlling the observed trait mean and variance across geographic gradients.",https://doi.org/10.3732/ajb.94.3.451,0
Correlation between disease phenotype and genetic heterogeneity in rheumatoid arthritis.,"RA is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by variations in clinical manifestations, disease course, and probably response to therapeutic interventions. We have addressed the question whether genetically and potentially etiologically more homogeneous subgroups of RA patients can be defined based upon the expression of the RA-linked sequence motif in the third hypervariable region of the HLA-DRB1 gene. Genetic comparison of patients classified upon clinical manifestation and disease course demonstrated that patients with mild disease were genetically distinct from those progressing to severe and destructive disease. Specifically, rheumatoid factor (RF) negative patients preferentially expressed RA-linked HLA-DRB1 alleles with an arginine substitution in position 71, whereas the alleles with a lysine substitution in position 71 accumulated in RF+ patients. RF- patients were further subdivided based on clinical markers (time of onset of erosive disease and requirement for aggressive therapy). Clinical heterogeneity correlated with genetic heterogeneity. Patients with early erosive disease and patients requiring aggressive therapy frequently typed HLA-DRB1*04+. Patients with late erosive/nonerosive disease or a benign disease course manageable with nonaggressive treatment preferentially expressed HLA-DRB1*01 or lacked an RA-linked haplotype. These data indicate that the heterogeneity of RA reflects genetic differences. Sequence variations within the disease-linked sequence motif, as well as polymorphisms surrounding the candidate genetic element, affect pattern, course, and treatment response of RA. Amino acid position 71 in the HLA-DRB1 gene has a unique role, the understanding of which may provide important clues to disease etiology.",https://doi.org/10.1172/jci117900,0
Characterization of Putative Stem Cell Phenotype in Human Limbal Epithelia,"This study evaluated proposed molecular markers related to stem cell (SC) properties with the intention of characterizing a putative SC phenotype in human limbal epithelia. Human corneal and limbal tissues were cut in the vertical and horizontal meridians for histology, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and immunostaining. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) and in situ hybridization were used to evaluate gene expression. TEM showed that the limbal basal cells were small primitive cells. Immunostaining disclosed that p63, ABCG2 and integrin α9 were primarily expressed by the basal epithelial cells of limbus. Antibodies against integrin β1, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), K19, enolase‐α, and CD71 stained the basal cells of the limbus more brightly than the suprabasal epithelia. Integrin α6, nestin, E‐cadherin and connexin 43 did not stain the limbal basal cells, but the suprabasal epithelia of the cornea and limbus showed strong immunoreactivity. K3 and involucrin stained only corneal and limbal superficial cells. RT‐PCR showed higher levels of p63, ABCG2 and integrin α9 mRNA, but lower levels of K3, K12 and connexin 43 expressed in the limbal epithelia than the corneal epithelia. In situ hybridization showed that p63 transcripts were located in basal layer of the limbal epithelium. This work suggests that the basal epithelial cells of the limbus are p63, ABCG2 and integrin α9 positive, and nestin, E‐cadherin, connexin 43, involucrin, K3, and K12 negative, with relatively higher expression of integrin β1, EGFR, K19, and enolase‐α. This putative SC phenotype may facilitate the identification and isolation of limbal epithelial SCs.",https://doi.org/10.1634/stemcells.22-3-355,0
"Chronotype: a review of the advances, limits and applicability of the main instruments used in the literature to assess human phenotype","The study of circadian typology differences has increased in the last few years. As a result, new instruments have been developed to estimate the individual circadian phase of temporal human behavior, also referred as chronotype. The current review was conducted to evaluate the differences among the questionnaires most frequently used to assess chronotype: the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), the Composite Scale of Morningness (CSM), and the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ). Each instrument evaluates a different aspect of chronotype. MEQ is considered to evaluate the phase preferences of individual behavior over a 24-hour day, while MCTQ measures the phase of sleep positions for both free and work days. CSM is similar to MEQ, but is more sensitive to measure shift work. The concept of chronotype has been used to refer to phase positions or phase preferences in the literature reviewed. Most of the time this is a consequence of different interpretations: it is not clear whether phase preferences are a direct manifestation of the individual's internal clock or a result of external cues, e.g., social interaction (including the alarm clock). Also, phase preferences are not uniform throughout life. Therefore, a single assessment, not taking age into consideration, will not accurately describe the sample. We suggest that MCTQ is the best instrument for investigators dealing with desynchronization and as an instrument for sleep phase. Conversely, if the goal is to assess characteristics that change under specific situations - chronotype -, the MEQ should be used.",https://doi.org/10.1590/s2237-60892013000100002,0
Studies of familial type III hyperlipoproteinemia using as a genetic marker the apoE phenotype E2/2,"Clinical symptoms, lipoprotein patterns, and apoE phenotypes were determined in 17 individuals with type 111 hyperlipoproteinemia (type 111 HLP) and in their relatives and spouses.The apoE phenotype E2/2 occurred in 15 type 111 HLP probands (88%) and the apoE phenotype E4/2 was found in 2 probands.In each of the families studied, the apoE phenotype inheritance was compatible with a model we previously proposed in which apoE is determined at a single genetic locus with three common alleles.The apoE phenotypes E4/4, E3/3, and E2/2 represent homozygosity for the apoE alleles €4, €3, and €2, respectively, whereas the apoE phenotypes E4/3, E3/2, and E4/2 represent heterozygosity for the apoE alleles c4/e3, <3/e2, and ~4/c2, respectively.Plasma lipids in 69 relatives of type 111 HLP probands were analyzed by apoE phenotype and revealed no significant differences between phenotypes in the levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, or HDL cholesterol.However, there were differences between the apoE phenotypes in LDL cholesterol levels (P = 0.01) and in the ratio of VLDL cholesterol/total triglyceride (ratio) (P < 0.01).Relatives with the apoE phenotype E2/2 had the Abbreviations: type 111 HLP, type 111 hyperlipoproteinemia; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0022-2275(20)38060-3,0
Transformation of Astrocytes to a Neuroprotective Phenotype by Microglia via P2Y1 Receptor Downregulation,"Microglia and astrocytes become reactive following traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the coordination of this reactivity and its relation to pathophysiology are unclear. Here, we show that microglia transform astrocytes into a neuroprotective phenotype via downregulation of the P2Y1 purinergic receptor. TBI initially caused microglial activation in the injury core, followed by reactive astrogliosis in the peri-injured region and formation of a neuroprotective astrocyte scar. Equivalent changes to astrocytes were observed in vitro after injury. This change in astrocyte phenotype resulted from P2Y1 receptor downregulation, mediated by microglia-derived cytokines. In mice, astrocyte-specific P2Y1 receptor overexpression (Astro-P2Y1OE) counteracted scar formation, while astrocyte-specific P2Y1 receptor knockdown (Astro-P2Y1KD) facilitated scar formation, suggesting critical roles of P2Y1 receptors in the transformation. Astro-P2Y1OE and Astro-P2Y1KD mice showed increased and reduced neuronal damage, respectively. Altogether, our findings indicate that microglia-astrocyte interaction, involving a purinergic signal, is essential for the formation of neuroprotective astrocytes.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2017.04.047,0
The CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizer Phenotype May Be Associated With Risperidone Adverse Drug Reactions and Discontinuation,"Article AbstractObjective: The cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme metabolizes risperidone. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers have no CYP2D6 activity (7% of whites and 1%-2% of other races). This study tested whether the CYP2D6 poor metabolizer phenotype was associated with adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and discontinuation due to ADRs. Method: Adult inpatients and outpatients were recruited from July 2000 to March 2003 including (1) 325 who were stabilized on risperidone therapy and classified as either expressing moderate-to-marked ADRs (22%, 73/325) or not (78%, 252/325) and (2) 212 who discontinued risperidone and were classified as discontinued due to ADRs (38%, 81/212) or for other reasons (62%, 131/212). Genetic tests were performed by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction and/or by the AmpliChip CYP450 microarray system for up to 34 separate CYP2D6 alleles. Two logistic regression models with dependent variables (moderate-to-marked ADRs while taking risperidone and risperidone discontinuation due to ADRs) were evaluated with respect to the CYP2D6 phenotype. Results: The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the CYP2D6 poor metabolizer phenotype in the univariate analyses and after correcting for clinical variables were (1) OR = 3.1 (CI = 1.4 to 7.0) and 3.4 (CI = 1.5 to 8.0) for moderate-to-marked ADRs on risperidone and (2) OR = 3.0 (CI = 0.85 to 10.6) and 6.0 (CI = 1.4 to 25.4) for discontinuation due to ADRs. Conclusions: The CYP2D6 poor metabolizer phenotype appears to be associated with risperidone ADRs and discontinuation due to ADRs; however, this finding requires further study in larger patient populations. The CYP3A5 and p-glycoprotein exon 21 and 26 genotypes were not significantly associated with risperidone response.",https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.v66n0103,0
Autosomal dominant cerebellar phenotypes,"The dominantly inherited ataxias comprise a series of clinical phenotypes that include ataxia, dysarthria, dysmetria, and intention tremor resulting from the involvement of the cerebellum and its afferent and efferent pathways. These inherited ataxias occur commonly throughout the world and represent an area of intense neurologic research. Although the clinical manifestations and neuropathologic findings of cerebellar disease are predominant, there may be characteristic changes in the basal ganglia, brainstem, spinal cord, optic nerves, retina, and peripheral nerve. In large families with dominantly inherited disease, there are many gradations, from pure cerebellar manifestations to mixed cerebellar and brainstem disorders, cerebellar and basal ganglia syndromes, and spinal cord or peripheral nerve disease. Rarely, dementia may be present as well. The clinical picture may be consistent within a family with dominantly inherited ataxia, but on occasion there is a characteristic syndrome in the majority of affected family members and an entirely different phenotype in one or several members. For these reasons, I suggested in 1990 [1] that for the autosomal dominant phenotypes, the genotype would be required to settle the issue of disease assignment and classification.

Neurologists have written extensively as to the appropriateness of various classifications and have debated, often passionately at meetings, the uniqueness and placement of newly evaluated families with inherited cerebellar disease. Categories of disease abound, therein satisfying the needs of selective investigators to be either unifiers or splitters, often based on quite arbitrary factors [1]. Scholarly, yet divergent, classifications of dominantly inherited syndromes have been formulated by Greenfield, [2] Konigsmark and Weiner, [3] Harding, [4] and the World Federation of Neurology Study Group on Cerebellar Ataxias (unpublished, 1993). Harding [4] separates the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) into type I and type II, in which ataxia is combined to a varying degree with pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs …",https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.45.1.1,0
Development of the short version of the spielberger state—trait anxiety inventory,"The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) has been widely used to measure the state and trait components of anxiety. We sought to develop a short, yet reliable and valid form of these scales for use in circumstances where the full‐form is not feasible. We abbreviated the scales using item response theory analyses to retain the items that could discriminate the best among participants. One sample (N = 922) completed the state scale, a second sample (N = 2227) completed the trait scale, while a third sample (N = 250) completed the short forms. Our participants completed the Hungarian version of STAI alongside other measures to observe external validity. We calculated cut-off scores for the state (>9.5,) and trait (>13.5) scales. A total of 19.5% and 20.1% of the respondents reached the cut-off scores. The five-item short forms of STAI had sound psychometric properties that are comparable to those obtained on the full-form. The external validity of the scales is also demonstrated. We report detailed descriptive statistics that could be used in further studies as standards. The short scales are reliable measures that could be used in clinical screening and behavioural research; especially where practical considerations preclude the use of a longer questionnaire.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113223,0
Nitrogen fixation island and rhizosphere competence traits in the genome of root-associated <i>Pseudomonas stutzeri</i> A1501,"The capacity to fix nitrogen is widely distributed in phyla of Bacteria and Archaea but has long been considered to be absent from the Pseudomonas genus. We report here the complete genome sequencing of nitrogen-fixing root-associated Pseudomonas stutzeri A1501. The genome consists of a single circular chromosome with 4,567,418 bp. Comparative genomics revealed that, among 4,146 protein-encoding genes, 1,977 have orthologs in each of the five other Pseudomonas representative species sequenced to date. The genome contains genes involved in broad utilization of carbon sources, nitrogen fixation, denitrification, degradation of aromatic compounds, biosynthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate, multiple pathways of protection against environmental stress, and other functions that presumably give A1501 an advantage in root colonization. Genetic information on synthesis, maturation, and functioning of nitrogenase is clustered in a 49-kb island, suggesting that this property was acquired by lateral gene transfer. New genes required for the nitrogen fixation process have been identified within the nif island. The genome sequence offers the genetic basis for further study of the evolution of the nitrogen fixation property and identification of rhizosphere competence traits required in the interaction with host plants; moreover, it opens up new perspectives for wider application of root-associated diazotrophs in sustainable agriculture.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0801093105,0
Genome Screen for Asthma and Related Phenotypes in the French EGEA Study,"A genome-wide search was conducted in 107 nuclear families with at least two siblings with asthma, as part of the French EGEA study. A two-stage analysis strategy was applied to the 107 families divided into two independent subsets of 46 and 61 families, where all regions detected in the first set of families were tested for replication in the second set. In addition, all regions reported by published genome scans in different populations were examined in the total sample. A total of 254 markers were typed in the first set of families and 70% of them in the second set. Linkage was investigated by model-free methods for asthma and four asthma-related phenotypes: bronchial responsiveness (BR), skin test response, total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, and eosinophil count. The two-stage analysis led to the detection of three regions: 11p13 for IgE, 12q24 for eosinophils, and 17q12–21 for asthma and skin tests. Among the regions reported by published genome screens, seven were found in the 107 French EGEA families: three being already detected by the two-stage analysis, 11p13 (p = 0.005), 12q24 (p = 0.0008), and 17q12–21 (p = 0.001), and four additional ones, 1p31 (p = 0.005) for asthma, 11q13 (p = 0.006) for IgE, 13q31 (p = 0.001) for eosinophils, and 19q13 (p = 0.02) for BR.",https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm.162.5.2002113,0
Plant root and mycorrhizal fungal traits for understanding soil aggregation,"Soil aggregation is a key ecosystem process resulting in the formation and stabilization of soil structure, consisting of soil aggregates and the resulting matrix of pore spaces. As such, it significantly alters the environment of plant roots and microbes in a multitude of ways; thus, soil structure provides the basic setting in which mycorrhizas operate and have evolved. Not surprisingly, soil aggregation is important for root growth and for a wide range of soil features and ecosystem process rates, such as carbon storage and resistance to erosion (e.g. Jastrow et al., 1998; Six et al., 2006). The aggregation of soil is a complex process, regulated by a range of abiotic factors (e.g. texture) and mediated by plants and multiple biota groups and their interactions; in spite of this complexity, plant roots and their mycorrhizal symbionts are consistently found to be a crucial force in driving soil aggregation (Six et al., 2004; Rillig & Mummey, 2006; Leifheit et al., 2014). Plant and mycorrhizal fungal species, respectively, differ in their contribution to soil aggregation (Reid & Goss, 1981; Angers & Caron, 1998; Eviner & Chapin, 2002; Rillig et al., 2002; Piotrowski et al., 2004; Six et al., 2004; Duchicela et al., 2012; Graf & Frei, 2013; Pérès et al., 2013), but from previous studies it has not yet become clear what specific root (and mycorrrhizal) traits contribute to this effect. This is likely because studies typically focus on only a limited suite of physiological and architectural characteristics, and the general research focus has traditionally been more on management practices and physico-chemical factors. Therefore, we lack a mechanistic understanding of the role of organisms in soil aggregation. To this end, we argue for a shift from a classical species-based comparative approach, or the mere consideration of summary variables (e.g. root length) to a systematic trait-based approach. Summarizing ecological characteristics of species by means of traits has become an essential tool in plant ecology (Westoby & Wright, 2006), and is increasingly proposed for root–fungal associations (e.g. van der Heijden & Scheublin, 2007; Chagnon et al., 2013; Aguilar-Trigueros et al., 2014). We believe trait-approaches are a promising tool to achieve progress in our mechanistic understanding of soil aggregation from an organismic perspective, to enhance our predictive ability regarding effects of plant and fungal diversity, and to ultimately provide informed recommendations for, for example, agricultural management and environmental restoration. With such data we can then ultimately address questions such as: how can plant and mycorrhizal fungal community data enhance prediction of soil aggregation beyond the consideration of state variables such as soil type, climate and management? Is soil aggregation an intermediate driver of plant and mycorrhizal fungal community processes and thus also an integral part of plant–soil feedbacks? And, on the applied side, can we enhance ecosystem restoration by designing tailor-made mycorrhizal fungal inocula and seed mixes specifically optimized for complementarity in the ability to enhance soil aggregation? In addition to general advantages, we see specific benefits of a trait-based approach applied to the understanding of mycorrhizal and plant contributions to soil aggregation: (1) it will allow testing for the extent of root and mycorrhizal fungal functional complementarity with regard to soil aggregation, and thus whether soil aggregation is another example of an ecosystem process that positively relates to biodiversity like other more well-studied processes such as primary productivity. This is very likely true because soil aggregation is the result of multiple interlocking component processes such as aggregate formation and stabilization (both of microaggregates and macroaggregates) which might be driven by different sets of traits represented in different species. Additionally, soil aggregation may be stimulated through diversity-fueled overyielding of fungi and roots through niche complementarity (also see Table 1); (2) if we can convincingly relate soil structure to traits of plant and fungal communities, this will allow predicting which ecosystems are under most risk of deterioration and also guide towards measures to counter this process. Measure: (loge (root or hyphal lengtht0) − loge (root or hyphal lengtht1)) × (t0 − t1)−1 Rationale: these three traits represent the growth ability of hyphae or roots to encounter building materials of aggregates in soil (primary particles, organic matter particles) and then form macroaggregatesa Proxy: (number of branches) × (root or hyphal length)−1; root or hyphal branching number and angle; alternatively: directly measure ability to engulf an object Rationale: these three traits measure the capability of hyphae or roots to stabilize aggregates depending on their tearing-resistance (i.e. ability to hold material together without breaking apart) and enmeshment potentialb Proxy: average distance between hyphae and associated root surface Rationale: larger distance between root and hyphae allows for increased probability of contact of aggregate building materials with either hyphae or rootsc Proxy: (entry points of hyphae or hyphal density close to root) × (root surface area)−1 Rationale: greater proximity of hyphae and roots increases probability of synergistic/combined effects of roots and hyphae (e.g. cementing agents, entangling) contributing to the stability of engulfed aggregatesc Measure: (surface charge of roots or hyphae) × (root or hyphal length)−1 Rationale: quantity and quality of secreted exudates determine the degree of particles adhering to roots or hyphae and agglutination of particles and aggregatesd Proxy: root water uptake or hyphal water transport (out of root-exclusion compartments) Rationale: these three traits evaluate directly and indirectly the fungal or root impact on soil rewetting capability affecting soil stabilitye Proxy: root or hyphal density in relation to soil porosity Rationale: enmeshment of soil by roots or hyphae lead to soil compression supporting initial aggregate formationf Proxy: stability of artificial aggregates (= soil particles + extracted root or hyphal exudates) Rationale: exudates stabilize aggregates by filling up intra-aggregate pore necks and cracksg Measure: (observation of particles moved by roots or hyphae) × (time unit)−1 Rationale: ability of roots or hyphae to bring soil particles together by moving them, leading to potential aggregation Measure: (root or hyphal growth (length and branching)) × (time unit after disturbance)−1 Rationale: these three traits represent aspects of root or hyphal longevity, resistance and resilience against biotic and abiotic disturbance affecting the potential aggregate stability mediated by root or hyphaeh An approach such as advocated here must begin with a selection of candidate traits related to soil aggregation. Of some traits we already know that they relate to soil aggregation propensity: using correlational approaches (path analysis) to exploit existing environmental gradients in landscapes, coarse-level indicators such as root biomass (or often root length) and mycorrhizal fungal hyphal length in soil have been identified as significant determinants (e.g. Miller & Jastrow, 1990; Rillig & Mummey, 2006). Thus, clearly productivity-related characteristics like root and hyphal density are traits to be considered. However, when such measures of root and hyphal abundance were compared to soil aggregation at a finer scale, for example in small field plots (e.g. Rillig et al., 2002) or pot experiments (e.g. Piotrowski et al., 2004), there was generally a low match, prompting the consideration of more specific physiological or architectural traits. In order to select these specific traits, we have first divided soil aggregation into the component processes soil aggregate formation and the stabilization of existing aggregates, and then considered measurable plant and fungal traits that are likely to be variable, and may mechanistically relate to either or both of these processes. For a full list see Table 1, and later we will further explain why these traits were selected and which difficulties may be encountered. Regarding aggregate formation and stabilization, even though these processes will occur simultaneously in ecosystems, these may be executed by different organisms expressing different traits. We define soil aggregate formation as the initial binding together of particles, whereas soil stabilization is the process that renders the aggregate increasingly resistant to the application of disintegrating forces, such as water penetrating into pores. If an aggregate is nonstable it will disintegrate; it has become clear that formation, stabilization and disintegration occur in a dynamic fashion in soils (e.g. Six et al., 2004). For the formation of soil aggregates, we consider traits to be important that are related to the likelihood to encounter soil particles (e.g. fineness of roots and hyphae, their extent and spatial distribution) and to bring soil material together (ability to move, entangle and engulf). In addition, exuded materials from roots and hyphae should play an important role in the initial formation of aggregates (Six et al., 2004). For stabilization of existing aggregates, traits related to persistence are hypothesized to be more important, such as tensile strength or longevity of roots and hyphae. The ability to render surfaces hydrophobic could also be important, as well as the release of cementing agents (Oades & Waters, 1991). We emphasize that these are hypotheses at this stage; only controlled experiments employing a range of plant and fungal species will reveal which of these traits are in fact of explanatory value at all, and for which component process. We realize that some of these traits will be relatively easy to measure, and have also been proposed as general functional traits (see Van der Heijden & Scheublin, 2007); others will be quite a challenge, and for some we propose proxy traits that will be easier to capture (Table 1). Clearly, much innovation is still possible once this research effort is under way. Another challenging aspect of linking single trait values to strains/species is trait variability (e.g. Cordlandwehr et al., 2013), which can be caused either by genetic variability at the species level or by phenotypic plasticity within the same genotype. Intraspecific diversity can have a profound influence on trait expression in mycorrhizal fungi (Johnson et al., 2012; Angelard et al., 2014) as well as in plants (e.g. Kichenin et al., 2013). Nevertheless, it remains yet to be seen if root and mycorrhizal fungal traits are more variable than other plant traits. Apart from this challenge, investigating this very plasticity could yield further insights; for example, some root traits have been proposed as highly relevant response traits in ecological studies due to their high plasticity (Ryser, 2006; Valverde-Barrantes et al., 2013), and if these include traits responsible for soil aggregation we might better understand under which circumstances plants are more likely to contribute to soil aggregation. For much of what we propose here, dedicated experiments are necessary, for example, for the separation of formation and stabilization of aggregates, or for comparing different root systems or fungal isolates under otherwise identical conditions. Nevertheless, several other approaches are possible to make inroads. For example, some trait data are already available because they have been collected for other purposes. Nevertheless, at present, plant trait databases (e.g. TRY, Kattge et al., 2011) are relatively poor in terms of coverage of root traits, in particular root traits that would be important in our specific context (Table 1). So far, comparable mycorrhizal fungal trait databases do not yet exist. Thus one important research focus should be the collection of root and mycorrhizal fungal traits for a number of species and linking these with experimentally measured soil aggregation, ideally dissected into component processes. These could be complemented by observational approaches, consisting of measuring community-average root traits in the field, which are linked to soil aggregation (here it would not be possible to distinguish formation and stabilization). Such data could also be particularly valuable for verifying predictions derived from knowledge of species-level data. Using traits can increase our fundamental understanding of the intricate relationship between plants, symbiotic fungi, and their immediate environment which is the soil aggregate. However, knowledge of root and mycorrhizal fungal traits could also have great applied significance. Such data could give rise to innovations such as tailored seed mixes (or fungal inoculum mixes) for grassland restoration which maximize trait coverage in terms of soil aggregation within the available plant species pool, as well as setting priorities for conservation efforts through predicting which ecosystems are most prone to degradation in light of invasive species and imminent global change. Likewise, better information on plant traits could be used to foster crop breeding for sustainable agriculture, or for agroecosystem management to enhance soil stability (e.g. by selecting cover crops also for complementary trait values).",https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.13045,0
Anatomical traits associated with absorption and mycorrhizal colonization are linked to root branch order in twenty‐three Chinese temperate tree species,"* Different portions of tree root systems play distinct functional roles, yet precisely how to distinguish roots of different functions within the branching fine-root system is unclear. * Here, anatomy and mycorrhizal colonization was examined by branch order in 23 Chinese temperate tree species of both angiosperms and gymnosperms forming ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular-mycorrhizal associations. * Different branch orders showed marked differences in anatomy. First-order roots exhibited primary development with an intact cortex, a high mycorrhizal colonization rate and a low stele proportion, thus serving absorptive functions. Second and third orders had both primary and secondary development. Fourth and higher orders showed mostly secondary development with no cortex or mycorrhizal colonization, and thus have limited role in absorption. Based on anatomical traits, it was estimated that c. 75% of the fine-root length was absorptive, and 68% was mycorrhizal, averaged across species. * These results showed that: order predicted differences in root anatomy in a relatively consistent manner across species; anatomical traits associated with absorption and mycorrhizal colonization occurred mainly in the first three orders; the single diameter class approach may have overestimated absorptive root length by 25% in temperate forests.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2008.02573.x,0

Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Modulates Cytosolic Redox Status and Contractile Phenotype in Adult Cardiomyocytes,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS)–mediated cell injury contributes to the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease and myocardial dysfunction. Protection against ROS requires maintenance of endogenous thiol pools, most importantly, reduced glutathione (GSH), by NADPH. In cardiomyocytes, GSH resides in two separate cellular compartments: the mitochondria and cytosol. Although mitochondrial GSH is maintained largely by transhydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase, the mechanisms responsible for sustaining cytosolic GSH remain unclear. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) functions as the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, responsible for the generation of NADPH in a reaction coupled to the de novo production of cellular ribose. We hypothesized that G6PD is required to maintain cytosolic GSH levels and protect against ROS injury in cardiomyocytes. We found that in adult cardiomyocytes, G6PD activity is rapidly increased in response to cellular oxidative stress, with translocation of G6PD to the cell membrane. Furthermore, inhibition of G6PD depletes cytosolic GSH levels and subsequently results in cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction through dysregulation of calcium homeostasis. Cardiomyocyte dysfunction was reversed through treatment with either a thiol-repleting agent (L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid) or antioxidant treatment (Eukarion-134), but not with exogenous ribose. Finally, in a murine model of G6PD deficiency, we demonstrate the development of in vivo adverse structural remodeling and impaired contractile function over time. We, therefore, conclude that G6PD is a critical cytosolic antioxidant enzyme, essential for maintenance of cytosolic redox status in adult cardiomyocytes. Deficiency of G6PD may contribute to cardiac dysfunction through increased susceptibility to free radical injury and impairment of intracellular calcium transport.

Patterns and traits of the endemic plants of Greece,"Greece is characterized by high plant diversity (5800 species) and endemism (15.6%). This study attempts a first overall assessment of the taxonomy, distribution, traits and conservation status of the Greek endemic plants. The endemic species belong to 56 families and 242 genera. Most of the endemic plants have a narrow geographical and altitudinal distribution range. The southern floristic regions are richer in endemic species. The species area relationships for endemics (EARs) for island and continental floristic regions explain over 50% of the variation in number of species and are characterized by steep curves. Analysis of the distributional pattern of the endemics by similarity coefficients offers useful insights into the palaeogeography and biogeography of Greece. The endemic species occur at all altitudes, but the altitudinal distribution shows a predominance of local endemics at 0–600 m in the island regions and in higher zones in the continental regions. The life form spectra show a predominance of hemicryptophytes and chamaephytes. This trait seems indicative of their habitat and adaptive strategy and may be related to speciation processes. The overview of the conservation status of the Greek endemics indicates that over 40% of the taxa are threatened or near threatened.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.2010.01025.x,0
Bone marrow‐derived stromal cell line expressing osteoblastic phenotype in vitro and osteogenic capacity in vivo,"Abstract Marrow stroma has been shown to have osteogenic potential. Here we report the characterization of a unique stromal cell line derived from mouse bone marrow (MBA‐15), which expresses osteoblastic phenotype in vitro and forms bone in vivo. More than 70% of cells in culture were histochemically positive for alkaline phosphatase. The enzyme levels were enhanced threefold when cultures were treated with dexamethasone. Gel electrophoresis of [ 3 H]‐proline‐labeled cultures showed that MBA‐15 cells produced only type I collagen. These cells were responsive to PTH, as indicated by a 50‐fold increase in intracellular cAMP. Prostaglandin E 2, but not calcitonin, stimulated cAMP up to 70‐fold. When cultures were grown to confluence and fed daily with ascorbic acid and β‐glycerophosphate, the cells formed a Von Kossa positive, thick extracellular matrix, shown to contain hydroxyapatite crystals. MBA‐15 cells produced mineralized bone when implanted in diffusion chambers. These results indicate that the MBA‐15 cell line possesses osteoblastic features in vitro and osteogenic capacity in vivo.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.1041400102,0
A <i>PERIOD3</i> variant causes a circadian phenotype and is associated with a seasonal mood trait,"Significance It has long been thought that sleep and mood are intimately connected in humans, but at present there are no known molecular links. We identified rare variants in the PERIOD3 gene in persons with both altered sleep behavior and features of seasonal affective disorder. We show that these variants recapitulate circadian and mood phenotypes in mouse models. Although we were not able to test mood in fruit flies, we did uncover a sleep trait similar to that seen in humans in flies carrying the human variants. Our molecular studies reveal that the variants led to less stable PER3 protein and reduced the stabilizing effect of PER3 on PER1/PER2, providing a mechanistic explanation for the circadian trait.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1600039113,0
What is being assessed and why it matters: The impact of transient error on trait research.,"Temporal instability can reflect either true psychological change or transient measurement error, and it is important that trait psychologists be able to distinguish one from the other. The authors report results from large retest studies of Big Five, trait affectivity, and personality disorder measures across time frames (2 months and 2 weeks) over which these constructs should show little or no true change. On average, nearly 25% of the variance in the measures was a product of transient error rather than true change; however, the proportion of error varied widely-but consistently-across measures. In addition, a reexamination of long-term longitudinal data demonstrated that ignoring transient error can lead to inaccurate conclusions. Most notably, a substantial portion of the observed instability in the Big Five and trait affectivity is due to transient error; thus, these traits are even more stable than commonly thought. The present data further suggest that previous reports of differential stability between the Big Five and trait affectivity are due, in part, to differential levels of transient error in measures of these constructs.",https://doi.org/10.1037/a0015618,0
Selectivity in Mammalian Extinction Risk and Threat Types: a New Measure of Phylogenetic Signal Strength in Binary Traits,"The strength of phylogenetic signal in extinction risk can give insight into the mechanisms behind species' declines. Nevertheless, no existing measure of phylogenetic pattern in a binary trait, such as extinction-risk status, measures signal strength in a way that can be compared among data sets. We developed a new measure for phylogenetic signal of binary traits, D, which simulations show gives robust results with data sets of more than 50 species, even when the proportion of threatened species is low. We applied D to the red-list status of British birds and the world's mammals and found that the threat status for both groups exhibited moderately strong phylogenetic clumping. We also tested the hypothesis that the phylogenetic pattern of species threatened by harvesting will be more strongly clumped than for those species threatened by either habitat loss or invasive species because the life-history traits mediating the effects of harvesting show strong evolutionary pattern. For mammals, our results supported our hypothesis; there was significant but weaker phylogenetic signal in the risk caused by the other two drivers (habitat loss and invasive species). We conclude that D is likely to be a useful measure of the strength of phylogenetic pattern in many binary traits.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01455.x,0
The use of measured genotype information in the analysis of quantitative phenotypes in man,"Summary Improved laboratory methods allow one to investigate the contribution of measured allelic variability at a locus physiologically involved in determining the expression of a quantitative trait. We present statistical methods that incorporate measured genotype information into the analysis of a quantitative phenotype that allows one simultaneously to detect and estimate the effects of a measured single locus and residual polygenic effects. Likelihoods are presented for the joint distribution of the quantitative phenotype and a measured genotype that are appropriate when the data are collected as a sample of unrelated individuals or as a sample of nuclear families. Application of this method to the analysis of serum cholesterol levels and the concentration of the group specific component (Gc) are presented. The analysis of the contribution of the common Gc polymorphism to the determination of quantitative variability in Gc using smaples of related and unrelated individuals presents, for the first time, the simultaneous estimation of the frequencies and the effects of the genotypes at a measured locus, and the contribution of residual unmeasured polygenes to phenotypic variability.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1986.tb01037.x,0
Frailty in Older Adults: Evidence for a Phenotype,"Background. Frailty is considered highly prevalent in old age and to confer high risk for falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality. Frailty has been considered synonymous with disability, comorbidity, and other characteristics, but it is recognized that it may have a biologic basis and be a distinct clinical syndrome. A standardized definition has not yet been established.",https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/56.3.m146,0
Expression and imprinting of MAGEL2 suggest a role in Prader-Willi syndrome and the homologous murine imprinting phenotype,"Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by the loss of expression of imprinted genes in chromosome 15q11–q13. Affected individuals exhibit neonatal hypotonia, developmental delay and childhood-onset obesity. Necdin, a protein implicated in the terminal differentiation of neurons, is the only PWS candidate gene to reduce viability when disrupted in a mouse model. In this study, we have characterized MAGEL2 (also known as NDNL1), a gene with 51% amino acid sequence similarity to necdin and located 41 kb distal to NDN in the PWS deletion region. MAGEL2 is expressed predominantly in brain, the primary tissue affected in PWS and in several fetal tissues as shown by northern blot analysis. MAGEL2 is imprinted with monoallelic expression in control brain, and paternal-only expression in the central nervous system as demonstrated by its lack of expression in brain from a PWS-affected individual. The orthologous mouse gene (Magel2) is located within 150 kb of Ndn, is imprinted with paternal-only expression and is expressed predominantly in late developmental stages and adult brain as shown by northern blotting, RT–PCR and whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization. Magel2 distribution partially overlaps that of Ndn, with strong expression being detected in the central nervous system in mid-gestation mouse embryos by in situ hybridization. We hypothesize that, although loss of necdin expression may be important in the neonatal presentation of PWS, loss of MAGEL2 may be critical to abnormalities in brain development and dysmorphic features in individuals with PWS.",https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/9.12.1813,0
Worm Phenotype Ontology: Integrating phenotype data within and beyond the C. elegans community,"Abstract Background Caenorhabditis elegans gene-based phenotype information dates back to the 1970's, beginning with Sydney Brenner and the characterization of behavioral and morphological mutant alleles via classical genetics in order to understand nervous system function. Since then C. elegans has become an important genetic model system for the study of basic biological and biomedical principles, largely through the use of phenotype analysis. Because of the growth of C. elegans as a genetically tractable model organism and the development of large-scale analyses, there has been a significant increase of phenotype data that needs to be managed and made accessible to the research community. To do so, a standardized vocabulary is necessary to integrate phenotype data from diverse sources, permit integration with other data types and render the data in a computable form. Results We describe a hierarchically structured, controlled vocabulary of terms that can be used to standardize phenotype descriptions in C. elegans, namely the Worm Phenotype Ontology (WPO). The WPO is currently comprised of 1,880 phenotype terms, 74% of which have been used in the annotation of phenotypes associated with greater than 18,000 C. elegans genes. The scope of the WPO is not exclusively limited to C. elegans biology, rather it is devised to also incorporate phenotypes observed in related nematode species. We have enriched the value of the WPO by integrating it with other ontologies, thereby increasing the accessibility of worm phenotypes to non-nematode biologists. We are actively developing the WPO to continue to fulfill the evolving needs of the scientific community and hope to engage researchers in this crucial endeavor. Conclusions We provide a phenotype ontology (WPO) that will help to facilitate data retrieval, and cross-species comparisons within the nematode community. In the larger scientific community, the WPO will permit data integration, and interoperability across the different Model Organism Databases (MODs) and other biological databases. This standardized phenotype ontology will therefore allow for more complex data queries and enhance bioinformatic analyses.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-12-32,0
Familial Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorders: Clinical Phenotype and Evidence of Disease Anticipation,"Chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMDs) have sporadic occurrence. However, familial clustering is reported. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and the clinical phenotype of familial CMDs, and to study the anticipation of disease onset in successive generations.Among 458 patients with apparently sporadic CMDs, an interview-based investigation of family history was performed to identify familial cases. The clinical phenotype of familial CMDs was compared with that of sporadic CMDs. Anticipation was studied evaluating age at diagnosis and telomere length in successive generations.Among 458 patients with apparently sporadic CMDs, the prevalence of familial cases was 7.6% (35 pedigrees; 75 patients). Kolmogorov-Smirnov and two-tailed Fisher's exact tests did not demonstrate significant differences in clinical presentation between patients with familial and sporadic CMDs. Within 544 person-years of follow-up, patients with familial CMDs developed similar complications and disease evolutions as those with sporadic CMDs. The comparison of second-generation and first-generation patients showed a significantly younger age at diagnosis (Wilcoxon matched-pair test, P = .001) and a significantly higher age-dependent hazard of CMD onset (Nelson-Aalen method, P < .001) in patients of the second generation. A significant shortening of telomere length was highlighted in offspring compared with parent (P = .043).This study indicates that a thorough investigation of family history should be part of the initial work-up of patients with CMDs. Patients with familial CMDs show the same clinical features and suffer the same complications as patients with sporadic disease. Age distribution between parent and offspring and telomere length shortening provide evidence of disease anticipation.",https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2007.12.6896,0
Mapping quantitative trait loci using four-way crosses,"Summary In plant species, typical gene mapping strategies use populations initiated from crosses between two inbred lines. However, schemes including more than two parents could be used. In this paper, a new approach is introduced which uses a four-way cross population derived from four inbred lines. The four-way cross design for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) provides tests for QTL segregation in four lines simultaneously in one experiment. Therefore, it is a more economical strategy than oneusing line crosses between only two lines. The new strategy also increases the probability of detecting QTLs if they segregate in one line cross but not in the other. A multiple linear regression analysis is used for QTL detection. It is proven that the expected residual variance from the regression analysis differs from the pure environmental variance. Correction for the bias is proposed and verified by computer simulations.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0016672300034066,0
Autistic traits in obsessive-compulsive disorder,"AbstractIn contrast to other non-psychotic psychiatric populations, subjects with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are more prone to have personality disorder from cluster A (the odd and eccentric cluster). The present study aims at further investigating the relationship between these and other personality traits in OCD subjects and their relation to high functioning autism (HFA) and Asperger disorder. Sixty-four subjects with OCD were included. Personality traits were assessed with the Karolinska Scales of Personality (KSP), and personality disorders with DSM-adapted questionnaires. In addition, autistic traits were assessed in 29 videotaped subjects, by 3 independent raters. Twenty percent of the subjects with OCD were identified as also having autistic traits. These subjects scored higher on KSP scales measuring muscular tension, psychasthenia, and inhibition of aggression and lower on socialization as compared with OCD subjects without autistic traits. Additionally, subjects with autistic traits fulfilled criteria for anxious personality disorders and paranoid personality disorders significantly more often than subjects without autistic traits. We propose that OCD is often related to HFA and Asperger disorder. Self-report questionnaires may be useful in establishing the diagnosis. However, those with the most obvious autistic features seem to be less able to identify these traits in themselves.KeywordsAutistic Disorder Empathy Obsessive-COMPULSIVE Disorder Personality Personality Disorder",https://doi.org/10.1080/08039480152036047,0
Molecular Phenotyping of Retinal Ganglion Cells,"Classifying all of the ganglion cells in the mammalian retina has long been a goal of anatomists, physiologists, and cell biologists. The rabbit retinal ganglion cell layer was phenotyped using intrinsic small molecule signals (aspartate, glutamate, glycine, glutamine, GABA, and taurine) and glutamate receptor-gated 1-amino-4-guanidobutane excitation signals as the clustering dimensions for formal classification. Intrinsic signals alone yielded 7 ganglion cell superclasses and 1 amacrine cell superclass; the addition of excitation signals ultimately resolved 14 natural ganglion cell classes and 3 amacrine cell classes. Ganglion cells comprise two-thirds to three-quarters of the cells in the ganglion cell layer and exhibited distinct metabolic, coupling, and excitation phenotypes, as well as characteristic sizes, population fractions, and patterns. Metabolic signatures (mixtures of glutamate, aspartate, glutamine, and GABA) chemically discriminated ganglion from amacrine cells. Coupling signatures reflected heterologous coupling states across ganglion cells: (1) uncoupled, (2) coupled to GABAergic amacrine cells, and (3) coupled to glycinergic amacrine cells. Excitation signatures reflected differential channel permeation rates across classes after AMPA activation. Extraction of unique size and patterning features from the data sets further validated the robustness of the classification. Because the classifications were explicitly blinded to structure, this is strong evidence that molecular phenotype classes are natural classes. Correspondences of molecular phenotype classes to functional classes were inferred from size, coupling, encounter, and physiological attributes. Ganglion cell classes display markedly different ionotropic drives, which may partly explain the physiological brisk–sluggish spectrum of ganglion cell spiking patterns.",https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.22-02-00413.2002,0
"Multipotential Nestin-Positive Stem Cells Isolated From Adult Pancreatic Islets Differentiate Ex Vivo Into Pancreatic Endocrine, Exocrine, and Hepatic Phenotypes","The endocrine cells of the rat pancreatic islets of Langerhans, including insulin-producing beta-cells, turn over every 40-50 days by processes of apoptosis and the proliferation and differentiation of new islet cells (neogenesis) from progenitor epithelial cells located in the pancreatic ducts. However, the administration to rats of islet trophic factors such as glucose or glucagon-like peptide 1 for 48 h results in a doubling of islet cell mass, suggesting that islet progenitor cells may reside within the islets themselves. Here we show that rat and human pancreatic islets contain a heretofore unrecognized distinct population of cells that express the neural stem cell-specific marker nestin. Nestin-positive cells within pancreatic islets express neither the hormones insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, or pancreatic polypeptide nor the markers of vascular endothelium or neurons, such as collagen IV and galanin. Focal regions of nestin-positive cells are also identified in large, small, and centrolobular ducts of the rat pancreas. Nestin-positive cells in the islets and in pancreatic ducts are distinct from ductal epithelium because they do not express the ductal marker cytokeratin 19 (CK19). After their isolation, these nestin-positive cells have an unusually extended proliferative capacity when cultured in vitro (approximately 8 months), can be cloned repeatedly, and appear to be multipotential. Upon confluence, they are able to differentiate into cells that express liver and exocrine pancreas markers, such as alpha-fetoprotein and pancreatic amylase, and display a ductal/endocrine phenotype with expression of CK19, neural-specific cell adhesion molecule, insulin, glucagon, and the pancreas/duodenum specific homeodomain transcription factor, IDX-1. We propose that these nestin-positive islet-derived progenitor (NIP) cells are a distinct population of cells that reside within pancreatic islets and may participate in the neogenesis of islet endocrine cells. The NIP cells that also reside in the pancreatic ducts may be contributors to the established location of islet progenitor cells. The identification of NIP cells within the pancreatic islets themselves suggest possibilities for treatment of diabetes, whereby NIP cells isolated from pancreas biopsies could be expanded ex vivo and transplanted into the donor/recipient.",https://doi.org/10.2337/diabetes.50.3.521,0
Divergent phenotypes in Gaucher disease implicate the role of modifiers,"Gaucher disease is classified into neuronopathic and non-neuronopathic forms with wide phenotypic variation among patients sharing the same genotype. While homozygosity for the common L444P allele usually correlates with the neuronopathic forms, how a defined genotype leads to a phenotype remains unknown.The genetic and epigenetic factors causing phenotypic differences were approached by a clinical association study in 32 children homozygous for the point mutation L444P. Direct sequencing and Southern blots were utilised to establish the genotype and exclude recombinant alleles. Glucocerebrosidase activity was measured in lymphoblast and fibroblast cell lines.Residual enzyme activity was highly variable and did not correlate with the observed clinical course. There was also a wide spectrum of phenotypes. Average age at diagnosis was 15 months, and slowed saccadic eye movements were the most prevalent finding. The most severe systemic complications and highest mortality occurred in splenectomised patients before the advent of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). On ERT, as morbidity and mortality decreased, developmental and language deficits emerged as a major issue. Some trends related to ethnic background were observed.The wide clinical spectrum observed in the L444P homozygotes implicates the contribution of genetic modifiers in defining the phenotype in Gaucher disease.",https://doi.org/10.1136/jmg.2004.028019,0
Phytoplankton defence mechanisms: traits and trade‐offs,"In aquatic ecosystems, unicellular algae form the basis of the food webs. Theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that one of the mechanisms that maintain high diversity of phytoplankton is through predation and the consequent evolution of defence mechanisms. Proposed defence mechanisms in phytoplankton are diverse and include physiological (e.g. toxicity, bioluminescence), morphological (e.g. silica shell, colony formation), and behavioural (e.g. escape response) traits. However, the function of many of the proposed defence mechanisms remains elusive, and the costs and benefits (trade-offs) are often unquantified or undocumented. Here, we provide an overview of suggested phytoplankton defensive traits and review their experimental support. Wherever possible we quantify the trade-offs from experimental evidence and theoretical considerations. In many instances, experimental evidence suggests that defences are costless. However, we argue that (i) some costs materialize only under natural conditions, for example, sinking losses, or dependency on the availability of specific nutrients, and (ii) other costs become evident only under resource-deficient conditions where a rivalry for limiting resources between growth and defence occurs. Based on these findings, we suggest two strategies for quantifying the costs of defence mechanisms in phytoplankton: (i) for the evaluation of defence costs that are realized under natural conditions, a mechanistic understanding of the hypothesized component processes is required; and (ii) the magnitude of the costs (i.e. growth reduction) must be assessed under conditions of resource limitation.",https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12395,0
THE EVOLUTIONARILY STABLE PHENOTYPE DISTRIBUTION IN A RANDOM ENVIRONMENT,"In an unpredictably changing environment, phenotypic variability may evolve as a ""bet‐hedging"" strategy. We examine here two models for evolutionarily stable phenotype distributions resulting from stabilizing selection with a randomly fluctuating optimum. Both models include overlapping generations, either survival of adults or a dormant propagule pool. In the first model (mixed‐strategies model) we assume that individuals can produce offspring with a distribution of phenotypes, in which case, the evolutionarily stable population always consists of a single genotype. We show that there is a unique evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) distribution that does not depend on the amount of generational overlap, and that the ESS distribution generically is discrete rather than continuous; that is, there are distinct classes of offspring rather than a continuous distribution of offspring phenotypes. If the probability of extreme fluctuations in the optimum is sufficiently small, then the ESS distribution is monomorphic: a single type fitted to the mean environment. At higher levels of variability, the ESS distribution is polymorphic, and we find stability conditions for dimorphic distributions. For an exponential or similarly broad‐tailed distribution of the optimum phenotype, the ESS consists of an infinite number of distinct phenotypes. In the second model we assume that an individual produces offspring with a single, genetically determined phenotype (pure‐strategies model). The ESS population then contains multiple genotypes when the environmental variance is sufficiently high. However the phenotype distributions are similar to those in the mixed‐strategies model: discrete, with an increasing number of distinct phenotypes as the environmental variance increases.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1995.tb02246.x,0
The mouse homeodomain protein Phox2 regulates <i>Ncam</i> promoter activity in concert with Cux/CDP and is a putative determinant of neurotransmitter phenotype,"ABSTRACT Transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding the cell adhesion receptor NCAM (neural cell adhesion molecule), a putative effector molecule of a variety of morphogenetic events, is likely to involve important regulators of morphogenesis. Here we identify two mouse homeodomain proteins that bind to an upstream regulatory element in the Ncam promoter: Cux, related to Drosophila cut and human CDP, and Phox2, a novel protein with a homeodomain related to that of the Drosophila paired gene. In transient transfection experiments, Cux was found to be a strong inhibitor of Ncam promoter activity, and this inhibition could be relieved by simultaneously overexpressing Phox2. These results suggest that the Ncam gene might be a direct target of homeodomain proteins and provide a striking example of regulatory cross-talk between homeodomain proteins of different classes. Whereas the expression pattern of Cux/CDP includes many NCAM-negative sites, Phox2 expression was restricted to cells also expressing Ncam or their progenitors. The localisation data thus strongly reinforce the notion that Phox2 plays a role in transcriptional activation of Ncam in Phox2-positive cell types. In the peripheral nervous system, Phox2 was strongly expressed in all ganglia of the autonomic nervous system and more weakly in some cranial sensory ganglia, but not in the sensory ganglia of the trunk. Phox2 transcripts were detected in the primordia of sympathetic ganglia as soon as they form. Phox2 expression in the brain was confined to spatially restricted domains in the hindbrain, which correspond to the noradrenergic and adrenergic nuclei once they are identifiable. All Phox2-expressing components of the peripheral nervous system are at least transiently adrenergic or noradrenergic. In the developing brain, Phox2 was expressed at all known locations of (nor)adrenergic neurones and of their precursors. These results suggest that Phox2, in addition to regulating the NCAM gene, may be part of the regulatory cascade that controls the differentiation of neurons towards this neurotransmitter phenotype.",https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.119.3.881,0
Specification of a Dopaminergic Phenotype from Adult Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells,"Dopamine (DA) neurons derived from stem cells are a valuable source for cell replacement therapy in Parkinson disease, to study the molecular mechanisms of DA neuron development, and for screening pharmaceutical compounds that target DA disorders. Compared with other stem cells, MSCs derived from the adult human bone marrow (BM) have significant advantages and greater potential for immediate clinical application. We report the identification of in vitro conditions for inducing adult human MSCs into DA cells. Using a cocktail that includes sonic hedgehog and fibroblast growth factors, human BM-derived MSCs were induced in vitro to become DA cells in 12 days. Based on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression, the efficiency of induction was determined to be approximately 67%. The cells develop a neuronal morphology expressing the neuronal markers NeuN and beta III tubulin, but not glial markers, glial fibrillary acidic protein and Olig2. As the cells acquire a postmitotic neuronal fate, they downregulate cell cycle activator proteins cyclin B, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Molecular characterization revealed the expression of DA-specific genes such as TH, Pitx3, Nurr1, DA transporter, and vesicular monoamine transporter 2. The induced MSCs also synthesize and secrete DA in a depolarization-independent manner. The latter observation is consistent with the low expression of voltage gated Na(+) and Ca(2+) channels in the induced MSCs and suggests that the cells are at an immature stage of development likely representing DA neuronal progenitors. Taken together, the results demonstrate the ability of adult human BM-derived MSCs to form DA cells in vitro.",https://doi.org/10.1634/stemcells.2007-0212,0
Quantifying the effects of temperature on mosquito and parasite traits that determine the transmission potential of human malaria,"Malaria transmission is known to be strongly impacted by temperature. The current understanding of how temperature affects mosquito and parasite life history traits derives from a limited number of empirical studies. These studies, some dating back to the early part of last century, are often poorly controlled, have limited replication, explore a narrow range of temperatures, and use a mixture of parasite and mosquito species. Here, we use a single pairing of the Asian mosquito vector, An. stephensi and the human malaria parasite, P. falciparum to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the thermal performance curves of a range of mosquito and parasite traits relevant to transmission. We show that biting rate, adult mortality rate, parasite development rate, and vector competence are temperature sensitive. Importantly, we find qualitative and quantitative differences to the assumed temperature-dependent relationships. To explore the overall implications of temperature for transmission, we first use a standard model of relative vectorial capacity. This approach suggests a temperature optimum for transmission of 29°C, with minimum and maximum temperatures of 12°C and 38°C, respectively. However, the robustness of the vectorial capacity approach is challenged by the fact that the empirical data violate several of the model's simplifying assumptions. Accordingly, we present an alternative model of relative force of infection that better captures the observed biology of the vector–parasite interaction. This model suggests a temperature optimum for transmission of 26°C, with a minimum and maximum of 17°C and 35°C, respectively. The differences between the models lead to potentially divergent predictions for the potential impacts of current and future climate change on malaria transmission. The study provides a framework for more detailed, system-specific studies that are essential to develop an improved understanding on the effects of temperature on malaria transmission.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2003489,0
A comparison of self-esteem lability and low trait self-esteem as vulnerability factors for depression.,"Self-esteem lability (SEL), defined as daily event-related variability in state self-esteem, and low trait self-esteem (TSE) were assessed among 205 male and female undergraduates who were currently depressed (CD), previously depressed (PD), and never depressed (ND). SEL scores were derived for the effect of positive, negative, and combined events on state self-esteem over 30 days. Consistent with psychodynamic and cognitive theories, SEL was found to be a better index of depression proneness than TSE. PD Ss showed higher lability on all SEL scores than ND controls but did not differ from controls on TSE. Ss were reassessed 5 months later, and new cases showed higher premorbid SEL than ND controls but did not differ from controls on premorbid TSE. SEL at Time 1 was found to increase risk for depression at Time 2 among Ss reporting high life stress at Time 2. Theoretical and methodological implications are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1037//0022-3514.66.1.166,0
"Mutant p53 DNA clones from human colon carcinomas cooperate with ras in transforming primary rat cells: a comparison of the ""hot spot"" mutant phenotypes.","The majority of the p53 genes derived from human colorectal carcinomas contain point mutations. A significant number of these mutations occur in or around amino acids 143, 175, 273, or 281. Experiments presented here demonstrate for the first time that p53 DNA clones containing any one of these mutations cooperate with the activated ras oncogene to transform primary rat embryo cells in culture. These transformed cells produce elevated levels of the human p53 protein, which has extended half-lives (1.5-7 h), as compared to the wild-type human p53 protein (20-30 min). The p53 mutant with an alteration at residue 175 (p53-175H) binds tightly to the cellular heat shock protein, hsc70. In contrast, the p53 mutants possessing mutations at either residue 273 or 281 (p53-273H/281G) do not bind detectably to this heat shock protein and generally are less efficient at forming transformed foci in culture. The transformed cell lines are tumorigenic in nude mice. Thus, two classes of p53 mutant proteins can be distinguished: p53-175H, which cooperates with ras efficiently and binds to hsc70, and p53-273H/281G, which has a reduced efficiency of transformed foci formation and does not bind hsc70. This demonstrates that complex formation between mutant p53 and hsc70 is not required for p53-mediated transformation, but rather it facilitates this function, perhaps by ensuring sequestration of the endogenous wild-type p53 protein. The positive effect on cell proliferation by these mutant p53 proteins is consistent with a role for activated p53 mutants in the genesis of colorectal carcinomas.",,0
"Personality Traits, Risk Perception, and Protective Behaviors of Arab Residents of Qatar During the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, people in Qatar-similar to most countries globally-were instructed by health authorities to adopt protective behaviors to avoid infection. One of these behaviors is social distancing, which is influenced by diverse variables. Using data from an online survey with 405 responses, this study performed multiple regression analysis to explore effects of personality, risk perception, and personal hygiene practices on social distancing among residents of Qatar. The results showed that 87.3% of participants reported that they preferred to stay at home and not go outside unless necessary, 60.3% said that they maintain an adequate distance when communicating with others, 68.6% reported that they do not allow relatives and friends to visit them at home, 73.5% believed that COVID-19 is a dangerous disease, and 95.8% reported that they embrace personal hygiene practices and washing hands. Furthermore, multiple regression analysis showed that conscientiousness, neuroticism, risk perception, and personal hygiene practices predicted social distancing, with moderate effect sizes. Gender differences were also found in social distancing practices, indicating that women reported higher engagement in social distancing practices than men. These results highlighted the importance of individual differences in reacting to the COVID-19 pandemic and provide important information about the predictors of social distancing practices.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00352-7,0
Cellular senescence and the senescent secretory phenotype in age-related chronic diseases,"Purpose of review Possible mechanisms in cellular senescence and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that drive and promote chronic inflammation in multiple age-related chronic diseases are considered. Recent findings A series of studies about the SASP indicate that senescent cells may be involved in the development of chronic inflammatory diseases associated with aging. Summary Aging is a complex biological process accompanied by a state of chronic, low-grade, 'sterile' inflammation, which is a major contributor to the development of many age-related chronic disorders including atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, cancers, and others. It appears that cellular senescence plays a role in causing inflammation through the SASP. A better understanding of the contribution of senescent cells to the pathologies of chronic inflammatory disorders could have potentially profound diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",https://doi.org/10.1097/mco.0000000000000065,0
Infra-Red Thermography as a High-Throughput Tool for Field Phenotyping,"The improvements in crop production needed to meet the increasing food demand in the 21st Century will rely on improved crop management and better crop varieties. In the last decade our ability to use genetics and genomics in crop science has been revolutionised, but these advances have not been matched by our ability to phenotype crops. As rapid and effective phenotyping is the basis of any large genetic study, there is an urgent need to utilise the recent advances in crop scale imaging to develop robust high-throughput phenotyping. This review discusses the use and adaptation of infra-red thermography (IRT) on crops as a phenotyping resource for both biotic and abiotic stresses. In particular, it addresses the complications caused by external factors such as environmental fluctuations and the difficulties caused by mixed pixels in the interpretation of IRT data and their effects on sensitivity and reproducibility for the detection of different stresses. Further, it highlights the improvements needed in using this technique for quantification of genetic variation and its integration with multiple sensor technology for development as a high-throughput and precise phenotyping approach for future crop breeding.",https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy4030397,0
Segmental repetition of neuronal phenotype sets in the chick embryo hindbrain,ABSTRACT The neurons within the segmented hindbrain of the early chick embryo have been mapped with the neuronal tracers HRP and fluorescent lysinated dextran. We have categorised neurons according to their axonal pathways and have then compared rhombomeres with respect to the number and class of neurons present. The results indicate that most rhombomeres are similar in that they contain the same set of basic neuronal types but differ in that particular neuronal types are more abundant in some rhombomeres than others. The data support the concept that the hindbrain develops according to ‘variations on a segmental theme’ rather than ‘each segment is unique’. Many of the cell types occupy distinct mediolateral domains that are probably established by both the differential migration of some neuronal classes and the spatial segregation of distinct precursors. The caudal rhombomeres 7 and 8 are exceptional in that they do not have the full set of basic neuronal types and also contain two additional medial cell types that are not present rostrally. The mechanisms that may generate the regional diversity apparent in the more mature hindbrain are discussed.,https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.118.1.151,0
"Two novel, severe asthma phenotypes identified during childhood using a clustering approach","Unsupervised cluster analysis has already been used to identify severe phenotypes of childhood asthma, but without taking into account inflammatory markers. The aim of this study was to define independent homogeneous phenotypic clusters of severe asthma in a cohort of asthmatic children. Cluster analysis was applied to 19 variables from 315 children enrolled in the Trousseau Asthma Program in Paris, France. Three independent clusters of asthma were identified. Cluster 1, asthma with severe exacerbations and multiple allergies: 103 children had more sensitisations to inhaled allergens and food allergens, more blood eosinophils and basophils, more uncontrolled asthma despite high doses of inhaled corticosteroid and more hospitalisations for exacerbation. Cluster 2, severe asthma with bronchial obstruction: 72 children were significantly older, had the highest body mass index, a lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s, more pronounced blood neutrophils and significantly higher levels of all classes of immunoglobulin (Ig), except IgE. Cluster 3, mild asthma: 140 children did not show statistically significant features. These results could lead to improved management of severe asthma in children by optimising treatment strategies, i.e. anti-allergic drugs, such as anti-IgE for children with the allergic phenotype, and anti-neutrophil drugs, such as macrolides for those with the obstructive phenotype.",https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00123411,0
Haemochromatosis in patients with β‐thalassaemia trait,"Severe iron overload has been reported in patients with the β‐thalassaemia trait. Studies performed before the discovery of the haemochromatosis gene ( HFE ) have yielded conflicting results: some suggest that iron overload might arise from the interaction of the β‐thalassaemia trait with heterozygosity for haemochromatosis, some with homozygosity for haemochromatosis and others that it was unrelated to haemochromatosis. We have studied the clinical phenotype, iron indices and HFE genotypes of 22 unrelated patients with the β‐thalassaemia trait and haemochromatosis, the inheritance of chromosome 6p and 1q haplotypes in families of non‐homozygous C282Y probands and serum measures of iron status in relatives heterozygous for C282Y with or without the β‐thalassaemia trait. We demonstrate that the β‐thalassaemia trait aggravates the clinical picture of C282Y homozygotes, favouring higher rates of iron accumulation and the development of severe iron‐related complications. We suggest that the coexistence of the β‐thalassaemia trait might also increase the risk of iron overload in patients with HFE genotypes at a mild risk of haemochromatosis. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that the association of the β‐thalassaemia trait with a single C282Y or H63D allele might lead to iron overload and suggest that other non‐ HFE ‐related inherited factors are present in haemochromatosis patients with incomplete HFE genotypes.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2141.2000.02436.x,0
"Phenotype, development, and biological function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells","CD11b+Gr-1+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are an important population of innate regulatory cells mainly comprising monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) with a phenotype of CD11b+Ly6G−Ly6Chigh and granulocytic MDSCs (G-MDSCs) with a phenotype of CD11b+Ly6G+Ly6Clow in mice. They play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of cancers, chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, and transplantation. Various extracellular factors such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin (IL)-6, interferon gamma (IFNγ), IL-1β, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Hsp72, IL-13, C5a, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) can induce MDSC differentiation, whereas IL-4 and all-trans-retinoic acid can inhibit this process. For the intracellular signals, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family members, C/EBPβ and cyclooxigenase-2 (COX-2) promote MDSC function, whereas interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF-8) and Smad3 downregulate MDSC activity. The immunosuppressive function of MDSCs is mediated through various effector molecules, primarily cellular metabolism-related molecules such as nitric oxide (NO), arginase, reactive oxygen species (ROS), transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), IL-10, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), carbon monoxide (CO), and PGE2. In this article, we will summarize the molecules involved in the induction and function of MDSCs as well as the regulatory pathways of MDSCs.",https://doi.org/10.1080/2162402x.2015.1004983,0
Individual Human Phenotypes in Metabolic Space and Time,"Differences between individual phenotypes are due both to differences in genotype and to exposure to different environmental factors. A fundamental contribution to the definition of the individual phenotype for clinical and therapeutic applications would come from a deeper understanding of the metabolic phenotype. The existence of unique individual metabolic phenotypes has been hypothesized, but the experimental evidence has been only recently collected. Analysis of individual phenotypes over the timescale of years shows that the metabolic phenotypes are largely invariant. The present work also supports the idea that the individual metabolic phenotype can also be considered a metagenomic entity that is strongly affected by both gut microbiome and host metabolic phenotype, the latter defined by both genetic and environmental contributions.",https://doi.org/10.1021/pr900344m,0
Molecular Portraits of Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Identify Clinical and Treatment Response Phenotypes,"Highlights•Deep phenotyping and RNA-seq of early rheumatoid arthritis individuals pre-treatment•Synovial plasma cell gene expression predicts future progressive joint damage on X-ray•Blood interferon gene signature associates with synovial B and plasma cell infiltration•Interactive website enables RNA-seq and clinical data to be fully exploredSummaryThere is a current imperative to unravel the hierarchy of molecular pathways that drive the transition of early to established disease in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Herein, we report a comprehensive RNA sequencing analysis of the molecular pathways that drive early RA progression in the disease tissue (synovium), comparing matched peripheral blood RNA-seq in a large cohort of early treatment-naive patients, namely, the Pathobiology of Early Arthritis Cohort (PEAC). We developed a data exploration website (https://peac.hpc.qmul.ac.uk/) to dissect gene signatures across synovial and blood compartments, integrated with deep phenotypic profiling. We identified transcriptional subgroups in synovium linked to three distinct pathotypes: fibroblastic pauci-immune pathotype, macrophage-rich diffuse-myeloid pathotype, and a lympho-myeloid pathotype characterized by infiltration of lymphocytes and myeloid cells. This is suggestive of divergent pathogenic pathways or activation disease states. Pro-myeloid inflammatory synovial gene signatures correlated with clinical response to initial drug therapy, whereas plasma cell genes identified a poor prognosis subgroup with progressive structural damage.Graphical abstract",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.07.091,0
Investigating genotype–phenotype relationships in Rett syndrome using an international data set,"Background: Rett syndrome is an uncommon neurodevelopmental disorder with an incidence of 1:9,000 live female births. The principal genetic cause was first reported in 1999 when the association with mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (or MECP2) gene was identified. This study uses data from a large international database, InterRett, to examine genotype–phenotype relationships and compares these with previous findings in a population-based cohort.",https://doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000304752.50773.ec,0
A Genome-Wide Association Study of Schizophrenia Using Brain Activation as a Quantitative Phenotype,"Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are increasingly used to identify risk genes for complex illnesses including schizophrenia. These studies may require thousands of subjects to obtain sufficient power. We present an alternative strategy with increased statistical power over a case-control study that uses brain imaging as a quantitative trait (QT) in the context of a GWAS in schizophrenia. Methods: Sixty-four subjects with chronic schizophrenia and 74 matched controls were recruited from the Functional Biomedical Informatics Research Network (FBIRN) consortium. Subjects were genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap300 BeadArray and were scanned while performing a Sternberg Item Recognition Paradigm in which they learned and then recognized target sets of digits in an functional magnetic resonance imaging protocol. The QT was the mean blood oxygen level–dependent signal in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during the probe condition for a memory load of 3 items. Results: Three genes or chromosomal regions were identified by having 2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) each significant at P < 10−6 for the interaction between the imaging QT and the diagnosis (ROBO1-ROBO2, TNIK, and CTXN3-SLC12A2). Three other genes had a significant SNP at <10−6 (POU3F2, TRAF, and GPC1). Together, these 6 genes/regions identified pathways involved in neurodevelopment and response to stress. Conclusion: Combining imaging and genetic data from a GWAS identified genes related to forebrain development and stress response, already implicated in schizophrenic dysfunction, as affecting prefrontal efficiency. Although the identified genes require confirmation in an independent sample, our approach is a screening method over the whole genome to identify novel SNPs related to risk for schizophrenia.",https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbn155,0
A review of approaches to identifying patient phenotype cohorts using electronic health records,"To summarize literature describing approaches aimed at automatically identifying patients with a common phenotype.We performed a review of studies describing systems or reporting techniques developed for identifying cohorts of patients with specific phenotypes. Every full text article published in (1) Journal of American Medical Informatics Association, (2) Journal of Biomedical Informatics, (3) Proceedings of the Annual American Medical Informatics Association Symposium, and (4) Proceedings of Clinical Research Informatics Conference within the past 3 years was assessed for inclusion in the review. Only articles using automated techniques were included.Ninety-seven articles met our inclusion criteria. Forty-six used natural language processing (NLP)-based techniques, 24 described rule-based systems, 41 used statistical analyses, data mining, or machine learning techniques, while 22 described hybrid systems. Nine articles described the architecture of large-scale systems developed for determining cohort eligibility of patients.We observe that there is a rise in the number of studies associated with cohort identification using electronic medical records. Statistical analyses or machine learning, followed by NLP techniques, are gaining popularity over the years in comparison with rule-based systems.There are a variety of approaches for classifying patients into a particular phenotype. Different techniques and data sources are used, and good performance is reported on datasets at respective institutions. However, no system makes comprehensive use of electronic medical records addressing all of their known weaknesses.",https://doi.org/10.1136/amiajnl-2013-001935,0
Refining the complex rheumatoid arthritis phenotype based on specificity of the HLA–DRB1 shared epitope for antibodies to citrullinated proteins,"Abstract Objective The main genetic risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the HLA region, has been known for 25 years. Previous research has demonstrated, within the RA population, an association between HLA–DRB1 alleles carrying the shared epitope (SE) and antibodies directed against cyclic citrullinated peptides (anti‐CCP antibodies). We undertook this study to make the first comparison of SE allele frequencies in the healthy population with those in RA patients who do or do not harbor anti‐CCP antibodies. Methods HLA–DRB1 typing was performed in 408 RA patients from the Leiden Early Arthritis Clinic (the Leiden EAC; a Dutch population‐based inception cohort in which disease course was followed up over time), in 423 healthy Dutch controls, and in 720 affected members of 341 US multiplex (sibpair) families of Caucasian origin from the North American RA Consortium (NARAC) with well‐established disease and fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for RA. The presence of anti‐CCP antibodies was determined by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. Results For the Leiden EAC, the odds ratio (OR) describing the association of 2 copies of the SE allele with anti‐CCP positivity (using no copies of the SE allele in the healthy control group as the referent) was 11.79 ( P &lt; 0.0001), while the OR for 1 SE allele was 4.37 ( P &lt; 0.0001). No association with the SE was observed in the Dutch anti‐CCP–negative RA patients. For the NARAC families, linkage and association analysis revealed the SE to be associated only with anti‐CCP–positive disease and not with anti‐CCP–negative disease. Stratified analyses indicated that anti‐CCP antibodies primarily mediated association of the SE with joint damage or disease persistence. Conclusion HLA–DRB1 alleles encoding the SE are specific for disease characterized by antibodies to citrullinated peptides, indicating that these alleles do not associate with RA as such, but rather with a particular phenotype.",https://doi.org/10.1002/art.21385,0

Tissue tolerance: an essential but elusive trait for salt-tolerant crops,"For a plant to persist in saline soil, osmotic adjustment of all plant cells is essential. The more salt-tolerant species accumulate Na+ and Cl- to concentrations in leaves and roots that are similar to the external solution, thus allowing energy-efficient osmotic adjustment. Adverse effects of Na+ and Cl- on metabolism must be avoided, resulting in a situation known as 'tissue tolerance'. The strategy of sequestering Na+ and Cl- in vacuoles and keeping concentrations low in the cytoplasm is an important contributor to tissue tolerance. Although there are clear differences between species in the ability to accommodate these ions in their leaves, it remains unknown whether there is genetic variation in this ability within a species. This viewpoint considers the concept of tissue tolerance, and how to measure it. Four conclusions are drawn: (1) osmotic adjustment is inseparable from the trait of tissue tolerance; (2) energy-efficient osmotic adjustment should involve ions and only minimal organic solutes; (3) screening methods should focus on measuring tolerance, not injury; and (4) high-throughput protocols that avoid the need for control plants and multiple Na+ or Cl- measurements should be developed. We present guidelines to identify useful genetic variation in tissue tolerance that can be harnessed for plant breeding of salt tolerance.",https://doi.org/10.1071/fp16187,0

We analyzed pathways targeted by microRNAs over-expressed in clinical oligometastasis samples and identified suppression of cellular adhesion, invasion, and motility pathways in association with the oligometastatic phenotype. We identified miR-127-5p, miR-544a, and miR-655-3p encoded in the 14q32 microRNA cluster as co-regulators of multiple metastatic pathways through repression of shared target genes. These microRNAs suppressed cellular adhesion and invasion and inhibited metastasis development in an animal model of breast cancer lung colonization. Target genes, including TGFBR2 and ROCK2, were key mediators of these effects. Understanding the role of microRNAs expressed in oligometastases may lead to improved identification of and interventions for patients with curable metastatic disease, as well as an improved understanding of the molecular basis of this unique clinical entity.",https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.2920,0
The use of electronic health records for psychiatric phenotyping and genomics,"The widespread adoption of electronic health record (EHRs) in healthcare systems has created a vast and continuously growing resource of clinical data and provides new opportunities for population-based research. In particular, the linking of EHRs to biospecimens and genomic data in biobanks may help address what has become a rate-limiting study for genetic research: the need for large sample sizes. The principal roadblock to capitalizing on these resources is the need to establish the validity of phenotypes extracted from the EHR. For psychiatric genetic research, this represents a particular challenge given that diagnosis is based on patient reports and clinician observations that may not be well-captured in billing codes or narrative records. This review addresses the opportunities and pitfalls in EHR-based phenotyping with a focus on their application to psychiatric genetic research. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that diagnostic algorithms with high positive predictive value can be derived from EHRs, especially when structured data are supplemented by text mining approaches. Such algorithms enable semi-automated phenotyping for large-scale case-control studies. In addition, the scale and scope of EHR databases have been used successfully to identify phenotypic subgroups and derive algorithms for longitudinal risk prediction. EHR-based genomics are particularly well-suited to rapid look-up replication of putative risk genes, studies of pleiotropy (phenomewide association studies or PheWAS), investigations of genetic networks and overlap across the phenome, and pharmacogenomic research. EHR phenotyping has been relatively under-utilized in psychiatric genomic research but may become a key component of efforts to advance precision psychiatry.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ajmg.b.32548,0
"Phenotypes in phylogeography: Species’ traits, environmental variation, and vertebrate diversification","Almost 30 y ago, the field of intraspecific phylogeography laid the foundation for spatially explicit and genealogically informed studies of population divergence. With new methods and markers, the focus in phylogeography shifted to previously unrecognized geographic genetic variation, thus reducing the attention paid to phenotypic variation in those same diverging lineages. Although phenotypic differences among lineages once provided the main data for studies of evolutionary change, the mechanisms shaping phenotypic differentiation and their integration with intraspecific genetic structure have been underexplored in phylogeographic studies. However, phenotypes are targets of selection and play important roles in species performance, recognition, and diversification. Here, we focus on three questions. First, how can phenotypes elucidate mechanisms underlying concordant or idiosyncratic responses of vertebrate species evolving in shared landscapes? Second, what mechanisms underlie the concordance or discordance of phenotypic and phylogeographic differentiation? Third, how can phylogeography contribute to our understanding of functional phenotypic evolution? We demonstrate that the integration of phenotypic data extends the reach of phylogeography to explain the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. Finally, we stress the importance of natural history collections as sources of high-quality phenotypic data that span temporal and spatial axes.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1602237113,0
"Genetic analysis of quantitative phenotypes in AD and MCI: imaging, cognition and biomarkers","The Genetics Core of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), formally established in 2009, aims to provide resources and facilitate research related to genetic predictors of multidimensional Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related phenotypes. Here, we provide a systematic review of genetic studies published between 2009 and 2012 where either ADNI APOE genotype or genome-wide association study (GWAS) data were used. We review and synthesize ADNI genetic associations with disease status or quantitative disease endophenotypes including structural and functional neuroimaging, fluid biomarker assays, and cognitive performance. We also discuss the diverse analytical strategies used in these studies, including univariate and multivariate analysis, meta-analysis, pathway analysis, and interaction and network analysis. Finally, we perform pathway and network enrichment analyses of these ADNI genetic associations to highlight key mechanisms that may drive disease onset and trajectory. Major ADNI findings included all the top 10 AD genes and several of these (e.g., APOE, BIN1, CLU, CR1, and PICALM) were corroborated by ADNI imaging, fluid and cognitive phenotypes. ADNI imaging genetics studies discovered novel findings (e.g., FRMD6) that were later replicated on different data sets. Several other genes (e.g., APOC1, FTO, GRIN2B, MAGI2, and TOMM40) were associated with multiple ADNI phenotypes, warranting further investigation on other data sets. The broad availability and wide scope of ADNI genetic and phenotypic data has advanced our understanding of the genetic basis of AD and has nominated novel targets for future studies employing next-generation sequencing and convergent multi-omics approaches, and for clinical drug and biomarker development.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11682-013-9262-z,0
Failed retrograde transport of NGF in a mouse model of Down's syndrome: Reversal of cholinergic neurodegenerative phenotypes following NGF infusion,"Age-related degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) contributes to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome. With aging, the partial trisomy 16 (Ts65Dn) mouse model of Down's syndrome exhibited reductions in BFCN size and number and regressive changes in the hippocampal terminal fields of these neurons with respect to diploid controls. The changes were associated with significantly impaired retrograde transport of nerve growth factor (NGF) from the hippocampus to the basal forebrain. Intracerebroventricular NGF infusion reversed well established abnormalities in BFCN size and number and restored the deficit in cholinergic innervation. The findings are evidence that even BFCNs chronically deprived of endogenous NGF respond to an intervention that compensates for defective retrograde transport. We suggest that age-related cholinergic neurodegeneration may be a treatable disorder of failed retrograde NGF signaling.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.181219298,0
Who's Who with Big-Five: Analyzing and Classifying Personality Traits with Smartphones,"In this paper, we investigate the relationship between behavioral characteristics derived from rich smart phone data and self-reported personality traits. Our data stems from smart phones of a set of 83 individuals collected over a continuous period of 8 months. From the analysis, we show that aggregated features obtained from smart phone usage data can be indicators of the Big-Five personality traits. Additionally, we develop an automatic method to infer the personality type of a user based on cell phone usage using supervised learning. We show that our method performs significantly above chance and up to 75.9% accuracy. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first study on the analysis and classification of personality traits using smartphone data.",https://doi.org/10.1109/iswc.2011.29,0
Modulation of the Osteosarcoma Expression Phenotype by MicroRNAs,"Osteosarcomas are the most common primary malignant tumors of bone and show multiple and complex genomic aberrations. miRNAs are non-coding RNAs capable of regulating gene expression at the post transcriptional level, and miRNAs and their target genes may represent novel therapeutic targets or biomarkers for osteosarcoma. In order to investigate the involvement of miRNAs in osteosarcoma development, global microarray analyses of a panel of 19 human osteosarcoma cell lines was performed.We identified 177 miRNAs that were differentially expressed in osteosarcoma cell lines relative to normal bone. Among these, miR-126/miR-126*, miR-142-3p, miR-150, miR-223, miR-486-5p and members of the miR-1/miR-133a, miR-144/miR-451, miR-195/miR-497 and miR-206/miR-133b clusters were found to be downregulated in osteosarcoma cell lines. All miRNAs in the paralogous clusters miR-17-92, miR-106b-25 and miR-106a-92 were overexpressed. Furthermore, the upregulated miRNAs included miR-9/miR-9*, miR-21*, miR-31/miR-31*, miR-196a/miR-196b, miR-374a and members of the miR-29 and miR-130/301 families. The most interesting inversely correlated miRNA/mRNA pairs in osteosarcoma cell lines included miR-9/TGFBR2 and miR-29/p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K. PTEN mRNA correlated inversely with miR-92a and members of the miR-17 and miR-130/301 families. Expression profiles of selected miRNAs were confirmed in clinical samples. A set of miRNAs, miR-1, miR-18a, miR-18b, miR-19b, miR-31, miR-126, miR-142-3p, miR-133b, miR-144, miR-195, miR-223, miR-451 and miR-497 was identified with an intermediate expression level in osteosarcoma clinical samples compared to osteoblasts and bone, which may reflect the differentiation level of osteosarcoma relative to the undifferentiated osteoblast and fully differentiated normal bone.This study provides an integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA in osteosarcoma, and gives new insight into the complex genetic mechanisms of osteosarcoma development and progression.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0048086,0
Clinical diabetic cardiomyopathy: a two-faced disease with restrictive and dilated phenotypes,"Diabetes mellitus-related cardiomyopathy (DMCMP) was originally described as a dilated phenotype with eccentric left ventricular (LV) remodelling and systolic LV dysfunction. Recently however, clinical studies on DMCMP mainly describe a restrictive phenotype with concentric LV remodelling and diastolic LV dysfunction. Both phenotypes are not successive stages of DMCMP but evolve independently to respectively heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFPEF) or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFREF). Phenotype-specific pathophysiological mechanisms were recently proposed for LV remodelling and dysfunction in HFPEF and HFREF consisting of coronary microvascular endothelial dysfunction in HFPEF and cardiomyocyte cell death in HFREF. A similar preferential involvement of endothelial or cardiomyocyte cell compartments explains DMCMP development into distinct restrictive/HFPEF or dilated/HFREF phenotypes. Diabetes mellitus (DM)-related metabolic derangements such as hyperglycaemia, lipotoxicity, and hyperinsulinaemia favour development of DMCMP with restrictive/HFPEF phenotype, which is more prevalent in obese type 2 DM patients. In contrast, autoimmunity predisposes to a dilated/HFREF phenotype, which manifests itself more in autoimmune-prone type 1 DM patients. Finally, coronary microvascular rarefaction and advanced glycation end-products deposition are relevant to both phenotypes. Diagnosis of DMCMP requires impaired glucose metabolism and exclusion of coronary, valvular, hypertensive, or congenital heart disease and of viral, toxic, familial, or infiltrative cardiomyopathy. In addition, diagnosis of DMCMP with restrictive/HFPEF phenotype requires normal systolic LV function and diastolic LV dysfunction, whereas diagnosis of DMCMP with dilated/HFREF phenotype requires systolic LV dysfunction. Treatment of DMCMP with restrictive/HFPEF phenotype is limited to diuretics and lifestyle modification, whereas DMCMP with dilated/HFREF phenotype is treated in accordance to HF guidelines.",https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehv134,0
Traits in Transition: The Structure of Parent‐Reported Personality Traits from Early Childhood to Early Adulthood,"Abstract The present research was conducted to map the hierarchical structure of youths' personality traits, to identify the foundational level of this structure, and to test whether the meanings of some youth personality dimensions shift with age. We addressed these issues by analyzing personality parent reports describing a cross‐sectional sample of 16,000 children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 3 to 20). These parent reports were made using a broadband measure of youths' personal characteristics, the common‐language C alifornia C hild Q ‐ S et. Analyses of the full sample and comparisons of 16 age groups supported three main conclusions. First, the hierarchical structure of youths' personality traits both resembles and differs from the adult personality hierarchy in important ways. Second, a set of six dimensions—Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, Openness to Experience, and Activity—may constitute the foundational level of the youth personality hierarchy from middle childhood through adolescence. This “Little Six” structure represents a union of the most prominent personality and temperament dimensions. Third, the meanings of some youth personality dimensions (e.g., Activity, Conscientiousness) shift systematically with age. These findings advance our understanding of when and how personality structure develops during the first two decades of life.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jopy.12044,0

Delivering on a promise: integrating species traits to transform descriptive community ecology into a predictive science,"The use of species traits in basic and applied ecology is expanding rapidly because trait-based approaches hold the promise to increase our mechanistic understanding of biological responses. Such understanding could transform descriptive field studies in community ecology into predictive studies. Currently, however, trait-based approaches often fail to reflect species–environment relationships adequately. The difficulties have been perceived mainly as methodological, but we suggest that the problem is more profound and touches on the fundamentals of ecology and evolution. Selection pressures do not act independently on single traits, but rather, on species whose success in a particular environment is controlled by many interacting traits. Therefore, the adaptive value of a particular trait may differ across species, depending on the other traits possessed by the species and the constraints of its body plan. Because of this context-dependence, trait-based approaches should take into account the way combinations of traits interact and are constrained within a species. We present a new framework in which trade-offs and other interactions between biological traits are taken as a starting point from which to develop a better mechanistic understanding of species occurrences. The framework consists of 4 levels: traits, trait interactions, trait combinations, and life-history strategies, in a hierarchy in which each level provides the building blocks for the next. Researchers can contribute knowledge and insights at each level, and their contributions can be verified or falsified using logic, theory, and empirical data. Such an integrated and transparent framework can help fulfill the promise of traits to transform community ecology into a predictive science.",https://doi.org/10.1899/12-092.1,0
"Resilient, overcontrolled, and undercontroleed personality prototypes in childhood: Replicability, predictive power, and the trait-type issue.","In a longitudinal study, Q-sort patterns of German preschool children were analyzed for personality prototypes and related to developmental outcomes up to age 12. Q-factor analyses confirmed 3 prototypic patterns that showed a high continuity and cross-judge consistency; were similar to those found for North American, Dutch, and Icelandic children; and can be interpreted as resilient, overcontrolled, and undercontrolled. Relations reported by R. W. Robins, O. P. John, A. Caspi, T. E. Moffitt, & M. Stouthamer-Loeber (1996) between these 3 patterns and the Big Five were fully replicated. Growth curve analyses showed that the 3 patterns predicted important developmental outcomes in both the social and the cognitive domains. Evidence was found for both traits and types: A continuous dimension of resiliency bifurcates in its lower part into two relatively discrete personality types, overcontrollers and undercontrollers.",https://doi.org/10.1037//0022-3514.77.4.815,0
Abnormal Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex Function in Children With Psychopathic Traits During Reversal Learning,"Children and adults with psychopathic traits and conduct or oppositional defiant disorder demonstrate poor decision making and are impaired in reversal learning. However, the neural basis of this impairment has not previously been investigated. Furthermore, despite high comorbidity of psychopathic traits and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, to our knowledge, no research has attempted to distinguish neural correlates of childhood psychopathic traits and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.To determine the neural regions that underlie the reversal learning impairments in children with psychopathic traits plus conduct or oppositional defiant disorder.Case-control study.Government clinical research institute.Forty-two adolescents aged 10 to 17 years: 14 with psychopathic traits and oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder, 14 with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder only, and 14 healthy controls.Blood oxygenation level-dependent signal as measured via functional magnetic resonance imaging during a probabilistic reversal task.Children with psychopathic traits showed abnormal responses within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 10) during punished reversal errors compared with children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and healthy children (P < .05 corrected for multiple comparisons).To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence of abnormal ventromedial prefrontal cortex responsiveness in children with psychopathic traits and demonstrates this dysfunction was not attributable to comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. These findings suggest that reversal learning impairments in patients with developmental psychopathic traits relate to abnormal processing of reinforcement information.",https://doi.org/10.1001/archpsyc.65.5.586,0

The traits included total number born (TNB), number born alive (NBA), number of stillborn (SB), number of mummified foetuses at birth (MUM) and gestation length (GL) in each of the first three parities. We report the associations of informative QTL and the genes within the QTL for each reproductive trait in different parities. These results provide evidence of gene effects having temporal impacts on reproductive traits in different parities. Many QTL identified in this study are new for pig reproductive traits. Around 48% of total genes located in the identified QTL regions were predicted to be involved in placental functions. The genomic regions containing genes important for foetal developmental (e.g. MEF2C ) and uterine functions (e.g. PLSCR4 ) were associated with TNB and NBA in the first two parities. Similarly, QTL in other foetal developmental (e.g. HNRNPD and AHR ) and placental (e.g. RELL1 and CD96 ) genes were associated with SB and MUM in different parities. The QTL with genes related to utero‐placental blood flow (e.g. VEGFA ) and hematopoiesis (e.g. MAFB ) were associated with GL differences among sows in this population. Pathway analyses using genes within QTL identified some modest underlying biological pathways, which are interesting candidates (e.g. the nucleotide metabolism pathway for SB) for pig reproductive traits in different parities. Further validation studies on large populations are warranted to improve our understanding of the complex genetic architecture for pig reproductive traits.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2052.2011.02213.x,0
"A random walk down university avenue: Life paths, life events, and personality trait change at the transition to university life.","This longitudinal study examined the relation between continuity and change in the Big Five personality traits and life events.Approximately 2,000 German students were tracked from high school to university or to vocational training or work, with 3 assessments over 4 years.Life events were reported retrospectively at the 2nd and 3rd assessment.Latent curve analyses were used to assess change in personality traits, revealing 3 main findings.First, mean-level changes in the Big Five factors over the 4 years were in line with the maturity principle, indicating increasing psychological maturity from adolescence to young adulthood.Second, personality development was characterized by substantive individual differences relating to the life path followed; participants on a more vocationally oriented path showed higher increases in conscientiousness and lower increases in agreeableness than their peers at university.Third, initial level and change in the Big Five factors (especially Neuroticism and Extraversion) were linked to the occurrence of aggregated as well as single positive and negative life events.The analyses suggest that individual differences in personality development are associated with life transitions and individual life experiences.",https://doi.org/10.1037/a0023743,0
