SpaCy Sentence: Additionally, soil aggregation may be stimulated through diversity-fueled overyielding of fungi and roots through niche complementarity (also see Table 1); (2) if we can convincingly relate soil structure to traits of plant and fungal communities, this will allow predicting which ecosystems are under most risk of deterioration and also guide towards measures to counter this process
