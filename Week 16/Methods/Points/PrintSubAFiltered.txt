Expanding Species
Sentence of (Final) Expanded Species: Plant and mycorrhizal fungal species, respectively, differ in their contribution to soil aggregation (Reid & Goss, 1981; Angers & Caron, 1998; Eviner & Chapin, 2002; Rillig et al., 2002; Piotrowski et al., 2004; Six et al., 2004; Duchicela et al., 2012; Graf & Frei, 2013; P√©r√®s et al., 2013), but from previous studies it has not yet become clear what specific root (and mycorrrhizal) traits contribute to this effect.
