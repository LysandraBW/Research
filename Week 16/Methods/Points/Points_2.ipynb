    "# Trait-Mediated Interaction Modification\n",
    "# Empirical:\n",
    "# You could look for words like \"hypothesis\", \"experiment\", \"found\", and \"discovered\". That may point\n",
    "# towards there being an experiment in the paper. There are also words like \"control group\", \"compared\",\n",
    "# \"findings\", \"results\", \"study\", and more.\n",
    "# Qualitative vs. Quantitative:\n",
    "# To infer whether something is quantitative, you could look for numeric tokens and units.\n",
    "# However, you can only do so much with the abstract. Therefore, this is likely not good enough.\n",
    "# Yet, you could still take advantage of words like \"fewer\" and \"increased\" to show that there is a change.\n",
    "# However, this would be more suited for the above category.\n",
    "# Traits:\n",
    "# There is no NLP tool for traits that I can use or create so I think that I could instead use keywords.\n",
    "# For example, \"snail feeding rates\" is a trait. You may be able to spot this by looking for a word like\n",
    "# \"rate\". You'd expand that word to include \"snail feeding rates\". As \"snail\" is a species you can infer\n",
    "# that \"rates\" is a trait. I would be more decisive and use a dependency parser to ensure that the trait\n",
    "# is a property of the species (like before). However, with all the cases that may exist, I think checking\n",
    "# to see whether a species can be found by traveling back and/or forward without finding certain tokens could\n",
    "# work well enough.\n",
    "# 3 Species or More:\n",
    "# This is simple. However, I think using a dictionary and TaxoNerd would be beneficial (for higher accuracy).\n",
    "# To handle the potential differences in tokenization, character offsets should be used.\n",
    "# Standardization:\n",
    "# There is a lot of variance in the scores. To squash this issue, I think that we could assign each sentence\n",
    "# a value from 0 to 1. We would add these values and divide by the number of sentences. This would result in\n",
    "# a number that is also from 0 to 1. However, there are categories that we would like to inspect. So, we must\n",
    "# create an overall score in the interval from [0, 1] while also scoring each category. Well, for each sentence\n",
    "# we could add a point for each category that is observed. The sentence would receive said score divided by the\n",
    "# number of categories. At the end, we add up all the sentence scores and divide by the number of sentences.\n",
    "# The aggregate score for each category would also be divided by the number of sentences."

    "text_1 = \"The use of chemical pesticides in agriculture is a critical threat to the environment. Implementing the use of biological control practices is an increasing worldwide challenge to cope with this matter. The exploitation of trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs), which is an avoidance behaviour of pests when detecting possible risk, is a new and interesting pathway to follow. Ants, which are predators of many insect pests, are commonly active on plants and release several different chemical traces in the substrate, making them potential candidates for TMII-based management approaches. We tested whether semiochemicals released by two Mediterranean ants, Crematogaster scutellaris and Tapinoma nigerrimum, are able to deter the occurrence of a strongly harmful pest of tree crops, the tephritid Ceratitis capitata, which lays eggs within fruits. Using binary choice tests between a plum previously visited by ants and another used as control, we actually observed an avoidance behaviour by females of C. capitata, which results in a lower amount of progeny production, suggesting that flies can detect the chemical compounds released by ants. This study suggests that scents triggering this deterrence effect are conserved across ant subfamilies and encourages improving this research to achieve a new low-impacting control method against agricultural pests.\"\n",

Our investigations reveal that M. carolinensis larvae may act as facultative intraguild predators of bark beetle larvae. Phloem sandwiches were used in four experiments to examine inter- and intraspecific interactions. We discovered that all sizes of M. carolinensis larvae killed bark beetle larvae. Seventy-six percent of the killed bark beetle larvae were consumed by M. carolinensis, including 58% that were entirely ingested. Cannibalism in M. carolinensis occurred in every experimental trial. Based on this evidence, M. carolinensis, and possibly related cerambycid species associated with bark beetles, are facultative intraguild predators of larvae of other phloem inhabiting species. The consequences of this behavior may have important implications for bark beetle population dynamics.\"\n",

Although less is known about trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) in more complex food webs, it has been suggested that such complexity dampens trophic cascades. We examined TMIIs between a predatory crab (Carcinus maenas) and two ecologically important basal resources, fucoid algae (Ascophyllum nodosum) and barnacles (Semibalanus balanoides), which are consumed by herbivorous (Littorina littorea) and carnivorous (Nucella lapillus) snails, respectively. Because crab predation risk suppresses snail feeding rates, we hypothesized that crabs would also shape direct and indirect interactions among the multiple consumers and resources. We found that the magnitude of TMIIs between the crab and each resource depended on the suite of intermediate consumers present in the food web. Carnivorous snails (Nucella) transmitted TMIIs between crabs and barnacles. However, crab–algae TMIIs were transmitted by both herbivorous (Littorina) and carnivorous (Nucella) snails, and these TMIIs were additive. By causing Nucella to consume fewer barnacles, crab predation risk allowed fucoids that had settled on or between barnacles to remain in the community. Hence, positive interactions between barnacles and algae caused crab–algae TMIIs to be strongest when both consumers were present. Studies of TMIIs in more realistic, reticulate food webs will be necessary for a more complete understanding of how predation risk shapes community dynamics.\"\n",
