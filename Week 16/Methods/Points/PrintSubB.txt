Sentence of Species: The aim of this study was to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in buffaloes associated with milk yield and content, in addition to somatic cell scores based on the cross-species transferability of SNPs from cattle to buffalo.A total of 15,745 SNPs were analyzed, of which 1562 showed 1% significance and 4742 with 5% significance, which were associated for all traits studied.After application of Bonferroni's correction for multiple tests of the traits analyzed, we found 2 significant SNPs placed on cattle chromosomes BTA15 and BTA20, which are homologous to buffalo chromosomes BBU16 and BBU19, respectively.In this genome association study, we found several significant SNPs affecting buffalo milk production and quality.Furthermore, the use of the high-density bovine BeadChip was suitable for genomic analysis in buffaloes.Although extensive chromosome arm homology was described between cattle and buffalo, the exact chromosomal position of SNP ©FUNPEC-RP www.funpecrp.com.brGenetics and Molecular Research 13 (4): 10256-10268 (2014) GWAS for milk production traits in buffalo markers associated with these economically important traits in buffalo can be determined only through buffalo genome sequencing.

Sentence of Species: In this study,Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.niveumis FO-11-06 was successfully transformed mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens,and T-DNA insertion mutants were further screened.The effects of pH and cultivation media on genetic transformation were studied under the condition of 25 ℃,1×106 spores/mL,A.tumefaciens(AGL1) OD600=0.15,200 μmol/L of acetosyringone and 48 h of co-cultivation in the presence of induction medium.The results showed that the transformants could be obtained in specific pH value range from 5.1 to 5.8 and the transformation efficiency reached the highest level at pH 5.3,with about 553 transformants per 106 spores.It also revealed that transformation efficiency was higher on cellophane(551 transformants per 106 spores) and NC millipore filter(549 transformants per 106 spores) compared to filter paper.Hygromycin resistance and PCR assay of the transformants showed that the T-DNA had been successfully integrated into the genome of F.oxysporum f.sp.niveumis FO-11-06.Forty six mutants with specific traits were identified from 1 989 transformants by assay of colony growth,colony color,and conidia output.The transformation system and mutants provided a basis for the study of development,pathogenicity mechanism and functional gene of the fungus.
