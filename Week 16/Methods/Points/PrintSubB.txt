In present study,Shaweimate meat-type quails were used to analyze MC3R gene polymorphism by PCR-SSCP.The results indicated that there were 3 mutation sites:T46C、G73A and T62A,respectively in the quail population.The three mutations produced 6 genotypes of AA,BB,CC,AB,AC and BC;the frequency of A,B,C alleles for MC3R gene in laying quails was 0.429,0.335and 0.236.The statistics analysis results showed that the effect of the MC3R polymorphism on body weight of 2,3 and 5 weeks age was significant(P0.05).In addition,it had significant effects on weight before slaughtering and eviscerated weight(P0.05),and extremely significant effects on semi-eviscerated weight(P0.01).The results indicated that MC3R gene maybe the major gene or linked gene of body weight and slaughter traits in quails.

Sentence of Current Species:
The aim of this study was to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in buffaloes associated with milk yield and content, in addition to somatic cell scores based on the cross-species transferability of SNPs from cattle to buffalo.A total of 15,745 SNPs were analyzed, of which 1562 showed 1% significance and 4742 with 5% significance, which were associated for all traits studied.After application of Bonferroni's correction for multiple tests of the traits analyzed, we found 2 significant SNPs placed on cattle chromosomes BTA15 and BTA20, which are homologous to buffalo chromosomes BBU16 and BBU19, respectively.In this genome association study, we found several significant SNPs affecting buffalo milk production and quality.Furthermore, the use of the high-density bovine BeadChip was suitable for genomic analysis in buffaloes.Although extensive chromosome arm homology was described between cattle and buffalo, the exact chromosomal position of SNP ©FUNPEC-RP www.funpecrp.com.brGenetics and Molecular Research 13 (4): 10256-10268 (2014) GWAS for milk production traits in buffalo markers associated with these economically important traits in buffalo can be determined only through buffalo genome sequencing.

The aim of this study was to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in buffaloes associated with milk yield and content, in addition to somatic cell scores based on the cross-species transferability of SNPs from cattle to buffalo.A total of 15,745 SNPs were analyzed, of which 1562 showed 1% significance and 4742 with 5% significance, which were associated for all traits studied.After application of Bonferroni's correction for multiple tests of the traits analyzed, we found 2 significant SNPs placed on cattle chromosomes BTA15 and BTA20, which are homologous to buffalo chromosomes BBU16 and BBU19, respectively.In this genome association study, we found several significant SNPs affecting buffalo milk production and quality.Furthermore, the use of the high-density bovine BeadChip was suitable for genomic analysis in buffaloes.Although extensive chromosome arm homology was described between cattle and buffalo, the exact chromosomal position of SNP ©FUNPEC-RP www.funpecrp.com.brGenetics and Molecular Research 13 (4): 10256-10268 (2014) GWAS for milk production traits in buffalo markers associated with these economically important traits in buffalo can be determined only through buffalo genome sequencing.

The aim of this study was to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in buffaloes associated with milk yield and content, in addition to somatic cell scores based on the cross-species transferability of SNPs from cattle to buffalo.A total of 15,745 SNPs were analyzed, of which 1562 showed 1% significance and 4742 with 5% significance, which were associated for all traits studied.After application of Bonferroni's correction for multiple tests of the traits analyzed, we found 2 significant SNPs placed on cattle chromosomes BTA15 and BTA20, which are homologous to buffalo chromosomes BBU16 and BBU19, respectively.In this genome association study, we found several significant SNPs affecting buffalo milk production and quality.Furthermore, the use of the high-density bovine BeadChip was suitable for genomic analysis in buffaloes.Although extensive chromosome arm homology was described between cattle and buffalo, the exact chromosomal position of SNP ©FUNPEC-RP www.funpecrp.com.brGenetics and Molecular Research 13 (4): 10256-10268 (2014) GWAS for milk production traits in buffalo markers associated with these economically important traits in buffalo can be determined only through buffalo genome sequencing.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) were detected by RT-PCR amplification and sequencing on the EST(GenBank accession No.BM445313)which was expressed in porcine muscle.Two new SNPs were found and located in the 3′UTR region of Myopalladin gene by homologous comparative analysis in the non-redundant sequence database of NCBI through BLAST search.One of the SNPs was genotyped by RFLP with restriction enzyme Csp6I and used for association analysis with carcass traits in the SCAU-LL F2 pig resource population.The results showed that the average carcass lean meat percentage of CT and CC genotype were 46% and 45% respectively,and the average carcass skin fat percentage of the two genotype were 42% and 44% respectively,these differences were significant(P0.05).Therefore,it could be seen that porcine Myopalladin genotypes had significant influence on carcass traits,and might be considered as a potential genetic marker for selection.

In this study,Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.niveumis FO-11-06 was successfully transformed mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens,and T-DNA insertion mutants were further screened.The effects of pH and cultivation media on genetic transformation were studied under the condition of 25 ℃,1×106 spores/mL,A.tumefaciens(AGL1) OD600=0.15,200 μmol/L of acetosyringone and 48 h of co-cultivation in the presence of induction medium.The results showed that the transformants could be obtained in specific pH value range from 5.1 to 5.8 and the transformation efficiency reached the highest level at pH 5.3,with about 553 transformants per 106 spores.It also revealed that transformation efficiency was higher on cellophane(551 transformants per 106 spores) and NC millipore filter(549 transformants per 106 spores) compared to filter paper.Hygromycin resistance and PCR assay of the transformants showed that the T-DNA had been successfully integrated into the genome of F.oxysporum f.sp.niveumis FO-11-06.Forty six mutants with specific traits were identified from 1 989 transformants by assay of colony growth,colony color,and conidia output.The transformation system and mutants provided a basis for the study of development,pathogenicity mechanism and functional gene of the fungus.

Sentence of Current Species:
Rheumatology has pioneered in the study of autoantibodies by showing that they are not only involved in pathogenesis but are also highly useful as diagnostic biomarkers.The diagnostic biomarker aspect of autoimmunity has gained increasing importance in cancer and many of the insights gained in Rheumatology have contributed to understanding the significance of autoantibodies in cancer.Features of autoantibodies in rheumatic disorders: In rheumatic diseases no individual autoantibody-antigen system has sufficient combination of sensitivity and specificity to serve as a useful diagnostic biomarker.Instead, several antigen-antibody systems constructed as profiles of biomarkers are highly effective in distinguishing one disorder from another.In lupus, anti-double strand DNA and anti-Sm distinguishes it from scleroderma, where the profile is anti-DNA topoisomerase 1 and anti-centromere proteins.The autoantigensare cell components involved in universal and basic gene expression pathways, such as Sm in precursor mRNA splicing and DNA topoisomerase 1 in DNA replication and transcription [1].Features of autoantibodies in cancer: Autoantibodies in cancer target intracellular molecules referred to as TAAs (tumor-associated antigens).As in rheumatic disorders, no individual autoantibody-antigen system has sensitivity and specificity to serve as a stand-alone diagnostic marker [2].Most tumors show multiple antibody specificities and with panels of TAAanti-TAAs (analogous toprofiles) the cumulative sensitivity and specificity reaches diagnostic significance.Different tumorigenesis pathways are

Rheumatology has pioneered in the study of autoantibodies by showing that they are not only involved in pathogenesis but are also highly useful as diagnostic biomarkers.The diagnostic biomarker aspect of autoimmunity has gained increasing importance in cancer and many of the insights gained in Rheumatology have contributed to understanding the significance of autoantibodies in cancer.Features of autoantibodies in rheumatic disorders: In rheumatic diseases no individual autoantibody-antigen system has sufficient combination of sensitivity and specificity to serve as a useful diagnostic biomarker.Instead, several antigen-antibody systems constructed as profiles of biomarkers are highly effective in distinguishing one disorder from another.In lupus, anti-double strand DNA and anti-Sm distinguishes it from scleroderma, where the profile is anti-DNA topoisomerase 1 and anti-centromere proteins.The autoantigensare cell components involved in universal and basic gene expression pathways, such as Sm in precursor mRNA splicing and DNA topoisomerase 1 in DNA replication and transcription [1].Features of autoantibodies in cancer: Autoantibodies in cancer target intracellular molecules referred to as TAAs (tumor-associated antigens).As in rheumatic disorders, no individual autoantibody-antigen system has sensitivity and specificity to serve as a stand-alone diagnostic marker [2].Most tumors show multiple antibody specificities and with panels of TAAanti-TAAs (analogous toprofiles) the cumulative sensitivity and specificity reaches diagnostic significance.Different tumorigenesis pathways are
