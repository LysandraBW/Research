Sentence of Current Species:
Post-dispersal seed fates varied significantly among the 6 seed species and 3 patterns were witnessed: large-seeded species with a hard seed coat (i.e. Choerospoadias axillaries and Diospyros kaki var. silvestris) had more seeds removed, cached and then surviving at caches, and they also had fewer seeds predated but a higher proportion of seeds surviving at the source; medium-sized species with higher profitability and thinner seed coat (i.e. Phoebe zhennan and Padus braohypoda) were first harvested and had the lowest probability of seeds surviving either at the source or at caches due to higher predation before or after removal; and small-seeded species with lower profitability (i.e. Elaeocarpus japonicas and Cornus controversa) had the highest probability of seeds surviving at the source but the lowest probability of seeds surviving at caches due to lower predation at the source and lower hoarding at caches.

Current Species: 'systemic lupus erythematosus(SLE' from 26-28
Sentence of Current Species:
Objective:To determine the relationship between IL-10RA gene polymorphism and disease phenotypes in lupus-prone NZB×NZW(B/W)F1 mice.Methods:The susceptibility loci of systemic lupus erythematosus(SLE) were determined by genome-wide quantitative trait locus(QTL) analysis using microsatellite markers.Candidate genes were selected and sequenced.Genotyping of the candidate gene which was polymorphic between NZB and NZW strains was done by PCR-single sequence conformation polymorphism(SSCP) analysis and associations between the genotypes and the SLE phenotypes,such as anti-chromatin antibodies,anti-DNA antibodies,anti-histone antibodies and protrinuria,were investigated using B/W F1×NZB backcross mice.Results:The susceptibility loci for high serum level of IgG anti-chromatin antibodies in B/W F1×NZB backcross mice was tightly linked to IL-10RA gene and derived from NZW strain.Sequence analysis of the IL-10RA coding region showed polymorphism between NZB and NZW mice and the polymorphism included 18 nucleotide transitions in the coding region,7 of which would lead to substitutions of amino acid in the resulting IL-10RA protein.The NZW IL-10RA allele was significantly associated with high serum level of IgG anti-chromatin antibodies,anti-DNA antibodies,anti-histone antibodies and protrinuria in B/W F1×NZB backcross mice.Another lupus-prone mice,MRL,shared the same IL-10RA polymorphism with NZW mice.Conclusion:Our data suggest that the polymorphic NZW IL-10RA allele on chromosome 9 is related to SLE phenotypes in B/W F1×NZB backcross mice,which may contribute to the development of SLE by serving as a susceptibility gene in murine lupus.

Objective:To determine the relationship between IL-10RA gene polymorphism and disease phenotypes in lupus-prone NZB×NZW(B/W)F1 mice.Methods:The susceptibility loci of systemic lupus erythematosus(SLE) were determined by genome-wide quantitative trait locus(QTL) analysis using microsatellite markers.Candidate genes were selected and sequenced.Genotyping of the candidate gene which was polymorphic between NZB and NZW strains was done by PCR-single sequence conformation polymorphism(SSCP) analysis and associations between the genotypes and the SLE phenotypes,such as anti-chromatin antibodies,anti-DNA antibodies,anti-histone antibodies and protrinuria,were investigated using B/W F1×NZB backcross mice.Results:The susceptibility loci for high serum level of IgG anti-chromatin antibodies in B/W F1×NZB backcross mice was tightly linked to IL-10RA gene and derived from NZW strain.Sequence analysis of the IL-10RA coding region showed polymorphism between NZB and NZW mice and the polymorphism included 18 nucleotide transitions in the coding region,7 of which would lead to substitutions of amino acid in the resulting IL-10RA protein.The NZW IL-10RA allele was significantly associated with high serum level of IgG anti-chromatin antibodies,anti-DNA antibodies,anti-histone antibodies and protrinuria in B/W F1×NZB backcross mice.Another lupus-prone mice,MRL,shared the same IL-10RA polymorphism with NZW mice.Conclusion:Our data suggest that the polymorphic NZW IL-10RA allele on chromosome 9 is related to SLE phenotypes in B/W F1×NZB backcross mice,which may contribute to the development of SLE by serving as a susceptibility gene in murine lupus.

Objective:To determine the relationship between IL-10RA gene polymorphism and disease phenotypes in lupus-prone NZB×NZW(B/W)F1 mice.Methods:The susceptibility loci of systemic lupus erythematosus(SLE) were determined by genome-wide quantitative trait locus(QTL) analysis using microsatellite markers.Candidate genes were selected and sequenced.Genotyping of the candidate gene which was polymorphic between NZB and NZW strains was done by PCR-single sequence conformation polymorphism(SSCP) analysis and associations between the genotypes and the SLE phenotypes,such as anti-chromatin antibodies,anti-DNA antibodies,anti-histone antibodies and protrinuria,were investigated using B/W F1×NZB backcross mice.Results:The susceptibility loci for high serum level of IgG anti-chromatin antibodies in B/W F1×NZB backcross mice was tightly linked to IL-10RA gene and derived from NZW strain.Sequence analysis of the IL-10RA coding region showed polymorphism between NZB and NZW mice and the polymorphism included 18 nucleotide transitions in the coding region,7 of which would lead to substitutions of amino acid in the resulting IL-10RA protein.The NZW IL-10RA allele was significantly associated with high serum level of IgG anti-chromatin antibodies,anti-DNA antibodies,anti-histone antibodies and protrinuria in B/W F1×NZB backcross mice.Another lupus-prone mice,MRL,shared the same IL-10RA polymorphism with NZW mice.Conclusion:Our data suggest that the polymorphic NZW IL-10RA allele on chromosome 9 is related to SLE phenotypes in B/W F1×NZB backcross mice,which may contribute to the development of SLE by serving as a susceptibility gene in murine lupus.

Current Species: 'murine lupus' from 265-266
Sentence of Current Species:
Objective:To determine the relationship between IL-10RA gene polymorphism and disease phenotypes in lupus-prone NZB×NZW(B/W)F1 mice.Methods:The susceptibility loci of systemic lupus erythematosus(SLE) were determined by genome-wide quantitative trait locus(QTL) analysis using microsatellite markers.Candidate genes were selected and sequenced.Genotyping of the candidate gene which was polymorphic between NZB and NZW strains was done by PCR-single sequence conformation polymorphism(SSCP) analysis and associations between the genotypes and the SLE phenotypes,such as anti-chromatin antibodies,anti-DNA antibodies,anti-histone antibodies and protrinuria,were investigated using B/W F1×NZB backcross mice.Results:The susceptibility loci for high serum level of IgG anti-chromatin antibodies in B/W F1×NZB backcross mice was tightly linked to IL-10RA gene and derived from NZW strain.Sequence analysis of the IL-10RA coding region showed polymorphism between NZB and NZW mice and the polymorphism included 18 nucleotide transitions in the coding region,7 of which would lead to substitutions of amino acid in the resulting IL-10RA protein.The NZW IL-10RA allele was significantly associated with high serum level of IgG anti-chromatin antibodies,anti-DNA antibodies,anti-histone antibodies and protrinuria in B/W F1×NZB backcross mice.Another lupus-prone mice,MRL,shared the same IL-10RA polymorphism with NZW mice.Conclusion:Our data suggest that the polymorphic NZW IL-10RA allele on chromosome 9 is related to SLE phenotypes in B/W F1×NZB backcross mice,which may contribute to the development of SLE by serving as a susceptibility gene in murine lupus.

Current Species: 'SLE' from 257-257
Sentence of Current Species:
Objective:To determine the relationship between IL-10RA gene polymorphism and disease phenotypes in lupus-prone NZB×NZW(B/W)F1 mice.Methods:The susceptibility loci of systemic lupus erythematosus(SLE) were determined by genome-wide quantitative trait locus(QTL) analysis using microsatellite markers.Candidate genes were selected and sequenced.Genotyping of the candidate gene which was polymorphic between NZB and NZW strains was done by PCR-single sequence conformation polymorphism(SSCP) analysis and associations between the genotypes and the SLE phenotypes,such as anti-chromatin antibodies,anti-DNA antibodies,anti-histone antibodies and protrinuria,were investigated using B/W F1×NZB backcross mice.Results:The susceptibility loci for high serum level of IgG anti-chromatin antibodies in B/W F1×NZB backcross mice was tightly linked to IL-10RA gene and derived from NZW strain.Sequence analysis of the IL-10RA coding region showed polymorphism between NZB and NZW mice and the polymorphism included 18 nucleotide transitions in the coding region,7 of which would lead to substitutions of amino acid in the resulting IL-10RA protein.The NZW IL-10RA allele was significantly associated with high serum level of IgG anti-chromatin antibodies,anti-DNA antibodies,anti-histone antibodies and protrinuria in B/W F1×NZB backcross mice.Another lupus-prone mice,MRL,shared the same IL-10RA polymorphism with NZW mice.Conclusion:Our data suggest that the polymorphic NZW IL-10RA allele on chromosome 9 is related to SLE phenotypes in B/W F1×NZB backcross mice,which may contribute to the development of SLE by serving as a susceptibility gene in murine lupus.
