Global Warming Could Magnify Insect-Driven Apparent Competition Between Native and Introduced Host Plants in Sub-Antarctic Islands,"Pristine sub-Antarctic islands terrestrial ecosystems, including many endemic species, are highly threatened by human-induced cosmopolitan plant invasion. We propose that native plant suppression could be further facilitated by the subsequent invasion by generalist pest species that could exacerbate their competitive exclusion through the process of apparent competition. By comparing the biological parameters of an invasive aphid species, Myzus ascalonicus, on one native (Acaena magellanica) and one invasive (Senecio vulgaris) plant species, we showed that survival and fecundity were higher and development time lower on the native plant species than on the invasive one. Moreover, comparing the effect of a temperature increase on the population dynamics of M. ascalonicus on the two plants, we showed that the relative profitability of the native species is further amplified by warming. Hence, while pest population doubling time is 28% higher on the invasive plant under current temperature, it would become 40% higher with an increase in temperature of 3°C. Consequently, our findings demonstrate that global warming could exacerbate competitive exclusion of native plants by invasive plants in sub-Antarctic islands by its indirect effect on the apparent competition mediated by generalist phytophagous pests.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvab122,693.3333333333334
Diet type and prey preference of predators affect intraguild predation between Amblyseius andersoni and Neoseiulus barkeri,"Amblyseius andersoni and Neoseiulus barkeri, two species of phytoseiid mites that are widely used for the control of small sucking pests, were found to co-occur on Chinese wolfberry in Inner Mongolia. We investigated the possibility of intraguild predation (IGP) between A. andersoni and N. barkeri to explore the interactions and coexistence of these two species. Predation and oviposition of the two predators on heterospecific juveniles were measured and compared with Tetranychus truncatus or Typha pollen as food, or without alternative food. The mortality rate of N. barkeri juveniles was not affected by the diet treatment, but that of A. andersoni juveniles was reduced by the presence of spider mites. The presence of spider mites also increased oviposition by A. andersoni but not by N. barkeri, and the presence of pollen had no influence on the oviposition of the two predators. Thus, according to the IGP criteria for gaining benefits from predation on heterospecific juveniles, it was concluded that IGP between A. andersoni and N. barkeri occurred, with A. andersoni as intraguild predator and N. barkeri as intraguild prey when spider mites were present. In a further choice test in which heterospecific juveniles and T. truncatus juveniles were provided for each predator, female A. andersoni preferred to prey on N. barkeri rather than on spider mites, whereas female N. barkeri preferred to feed on spider mites rather than on A. andersoni. These findings indicate that the higher preference of N. barkeri on T. truncatus might result in its lower predation on the other predator species compared with A. andersoni and, thus, increased the possibility of the coexistence of the two predator species. Therefore, the occurrence of IGP between A. andersoni and N. barkeri appears to be influenced by the availability and type of the diet and the prey preference of the predators.",https://doi.org/10.11158/saa.28.8.12,305.55555555555554
Resource Competition Triggers the Co-Evolution of Long Tongues and Deep Corolla Tubes,"Background It is normally thought that deep corolla tubes evolve when a plant's successful reproduction is contingent on having a corolla tube longer than the tongue of the flower's pollinators, and that pollinators evolve ever-longer tongues because individuals with longer tongues can obtain more nectar from flowers. A recent model shows that, in the presence of pollinators with long and short tongues that experience resource competition, coexisting plant species can diverge in corolla-tube depth, because this increases the proportion of pollen grains that lands on co-specific flowers. Methodology/Principal Findings We have extended the model to study whether resource competition can trigger the co-evolution of tongue length and corolla-tube depth. Starting with two plant and two pollinator species, all of them having the same distribution of tongue length or corolla-tube depth, we show that variability in corolla-tube depth leads to divergence in tongue length, provided that increasing tongue length is not equally costly for both species. Once the two pollinator species differ in tongue length, divergence in corolla-tube depth between the two plant species ensues. Conclusions/Significance Co-evolution between tongue length and corolla-tube depth is a robust outcome of the model, obtained for a wide range of parameter values, but it requires that tongue elongation is substantially easier for one pollinator species than for the other, that pollinators follow a near-optimal foraging strategy, that pollinators experience competition for resources and that plants experience pollination limitation.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002992,205.0
Competitive Plant-Mediated and Intraguild Predation Interactions of the Invasive Spodoptera frugiperda and Resident Stemborers Busseola fusca and Chilo partellus in Maize Cropping Systems in Kenya,"Following its recent invasion of African countries, fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), now co-exists with resident stemborers such as Busseola fusca (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Chilo partellus (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) causing severe damage to maize crops. Due to niche overlap, interspecific interactions occur among the three species, but the mechanisms and degree remain unclear. In this study, we assessed plant-mediated intraspecific and interspecific interactions, predation in laboratory and semi-field settings, and larval field occurrence of S. frugiperda and the two stemborer species. Larval feeding assays to evaluate competitive plant-mediated interactions demonstrated that initial S. frugiperda feeding negatively affected subsequent stemborer larval feeding and survival, suggesting induction of herbivore-induced mechanisms by S. frugiperda, which deters establishment and survival of competing species. Predation assays showed that, at different developmental larval stages, second−sixth instars of S. frugiperda preyed on larvae of both B. fusca and C. partellus. Predation rates of S. frugiperda on stemborers was significantly higher than cannibalism of S. frugiperda and its conspecifics (p < 0.001). Cannibalism of S. frugiperda in the presence of stemborers was significantly lower than in the presence of conspecifics (p = 0.04). Field surveys showed a significantly higher number of S. frugiperda larvae than stemborers across three altitudinally different agroecological zones (p < 0.001). In conclusion, this study showed that the invasive S. frugiperda exhibited a clear competitive advantage over resident stemborers within maize cropping systems in Kenya. Our findings reveal some of the possible mechanisms employed by S. frugiperda to outcompete resident stemborers and provide crucial information for developing pest management strategies for these lepidopteran pests.",https://doi.org/10.3390/insects13090790,143.0
Top predators and habitat complexity alter an intraguild predation module in pond communities,"Summary Predator diversity and habitat complexity frequently influence species interactions at lower trophic levels, yet their joint investigation has been performed infrequently despite the demonstrated importance of each individual factor. We investigated how different top predators and varying habitat complexity influence the function of an intraguild predation module consisting of two larval salamanders, intraguild predator Ambystoma annulatum and intraguild prey A. maculatum . We manipulated predator food webs and habitat complexity in outdoor mesocosms. Top predators significantly influenced body condition and survival of A. annulatum , but habitat complexity had minimal effects on either response. A three‐way interaction among the covariates top predator identity, habitat complexity and A. annulatum survival influenced body condition and survival of A. maculatum via a density‐mediated indirect effect. Different top predator combinations had variable effects in different habitat complexity treatments on intraguild predator ( A. annulatum ) survival that subsequently influenced intraguild prey ( A. maculatum ) body condition and survival. Future work should consider how different top predators influence other food web components, which should vary due to predator attributes and the physical environments in which they co‐occur.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12462,134.28571428571428
Temperature dependency of intraguild predation between native and invasive crabs,"Environmental factors such as temperature can affect the geographical distribution of species directly by exceeding physiological tolerances, or indirectly by altering physiological rates that dictate the sign and strength of species interactions. Although the direct effects of environmental conditions are relatively well studied, the effects of environmentally mediated species interactions have garnered less attention. In this study, we examined the temperature dependency of size-structured intraguild predation (IGP) between native blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus, the IG predator) and invasive green crabs (Carcinus maenas, the IG prey) to evaluate how the effect of temperature on competitive and predatory rates may influence the latitudinal distribution of these species. In outdoor mesocosm experiments, we quantified interactions between blue crabs, green crabs, and shared prey (mussels) at three temperatures reflective of those across their range, using two size classes of blue crab. At low temperatures, green crabs had a competitive advantage and IGP by blue crabs on green crabs was low. At high temperatures, size-matched blue and green crabs were competitively similar, large blue crabs had a competitive advantage, and IGP on green crabs was high. We then used parameter values generated from these experiments (temperature- and size-dependent attack rates and handling times) in a size-structured IGP model in which we varied IGP attack rate, maturation rate of the blue crab from the non-predatory to predatory size class, and resource carrying capacity at each of the three temperatures. In the model, green crabs were likely to competitively exclude blue crabs at low temperature, whereas blue crabs were likely to competitively and consumptively exclude green crabs at higher temperatures, particularly when resource productivities and rates of IGP were high. While many factors may play a role in delimiting species ranges, our results suggest that temperature-dependent interactions can influence local coexistence and are worth considering when developing mechanistic species distribution models and evaluating responses to environmental change.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2157,133.33333333333334
Does nitrogen limitation promote intraguild predation in an aphidophagous ladybird?,"Abstract Reciprocal intraguild predation occurs between the two aphidophagous ladybird beetles Coccinella septempunctata L. and Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). However, its direction is asymmetrical; H. axyridis generally acts as an intraguild predator, and C. septempunctata as an intraguild prey. According to Denno and Fagan's prediction that nitrogen shortages in predators may promote intraguild predation, it was hypothesized that growth of intraguild predator H. axyridis is more limited by nitrogen than that of intraguild prey C. septempunctata , and that H. axyridis growth is enhanced by feeding on C. septempunctata compared to feeding on aphids. To determine nitrogen‐limited growth in H. axyridis , the following two predictions were examined. First, it was predicted that the nitrogen content of H. axyridis would be higher than that of C. septempunctata when both feed on aphids. However, nitrogen content did not differ between the two ladybirds. Second, it was predicted that nitrogen‐use efficiency of H. axyridis would be lower than that of C. septempunctata . However, there was no significant difference between species. These results did not support the hypothesis that growth of H. axyridis is more limited by nitrogen than that of C. septempunctata. In addition, the present study showed that dry mass and nitrogen growth of H. axyridis were not enhanced, but rather decreased, by eating high‐nitrogen C. septempunctata , compared to eating low‐nitrogen aphids. Overall, the present study did not support the hypothesis that nitrogen shortages in predators may promote intraguild predation.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2006.00414.x,113.63636363636364
Variable Virulence and Efficacy of BCG Vaccine Strains in Mice and Correlation With Genome Polymorphisms,"Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG), an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, is the only vaccine available for tuberculosis (TB) control. However, BCG is not an ideal vaccine and has two major limitations: BCG exhibits highly variable effectiveness against the development of TB both in pediatric and adult populations and can cause disseminated BCG disease in immunocompromised individuals. BCG comprises a number of substrains that are genetically distinct. Whether and how these genetic differences affect BCG efficacy remains largely unknown. In this study, we performed comparative analyses of the virulence and efficacy of 13 BCG strains, representing different genetic lineages, in SCID and BALB/c mice. Our results show that BCG strains of the DU2 group IV (BCG-Phipps, BCG-Frappier, BCG-Pasteur, and BCG-Tice) exhibit the highest levels of virulence, and BCG strains of the DU2 group II (BCG-Sweden, BCG-Birkhaug) are among the least virulent group. These distinct levels of virulence may be explained by strain-specific duplications and deletions of genomic DNA. There appears to be a general trend that more virulent BCG strains are also more effective in protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis challenge. Our findings have important implications for current BCG vaccine programs and for future TB vaccine development.

Intraguild Predation of Beneficial Arthropods by Red Imported Fire Ants in Cotton,"The red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta (Buren), is an invasive species in the southern United States and is expanding its range westward to California and eastward up the Atlantic Coast. This voracious predator can reach extremely high densities and have widespread effects once it invades an ecosystem. We conducted a 2-yr sampling study and a series of greenhouse and field experiments to document the impact of red imported fire ants on beneficial insects in cotton. We found that the densities of 12 of 13 natural enemies sampled on cotton plants in 1999, and 8 out of 8 sampled in 2000, were negatively correlated with the densities of foraging fire ant workers. Red imported fire ants reduced the survival of lady beetles (Coccinella septempunctata L., and Hippodamia convergens Guérin-Méneville) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) by 50% and green lacewing larvae (Chrysoperla carnea Stephens) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) by 38% in greenhouse experiments. Fire ants did not, however, reduce the survival of spiders (Oxyopidae, Thomisidae, and Clubionidae). We used a commercially available fire ant bait to suppress fire ant populations in cotton fields during the 2000 growing season and compared the densities of beneficial arthropods in treated versus control fields. Densities of lady beetles, spiders, and big-eyed bugs (Heteroptera: Geocoridae) were significantly higher in fields with suppressed fire ant populations than in fields with relatively large fire ant populations. The effect of fire ants on minute pirate bugs (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) was inconsistent, and populations of damsel bugs (Heteroptera: Nabidae) and hooded beetles (Coleoptera: Anthicidae) were not affected by fire ant suppression. The results of this study suggest that red imported fire ants are major intraguild predators of important beneficial arthropods in cotton.",https://doi.org/10.1603/0046-225x-31.6.1168,71.0
Refuge-mediated apparent competition in a tallgrass prairie?,"The refuge-mediated apparent competition hypothesis (RMACH) posits that a plant species can indirectly reduce growth of competitors, and thus invade, by providing refuge for herbivores of more palatable surrounding plants. If the RMACH applies to Lespedeza cuneata, an invasive legume with dense, chemically defended foliage, I predict (a) more arthropods where the invasive is present, indicating that it provides more suitable habitat, (b) greater herbivory on plants surrounding the invasive than on the invasive itself, indicating it is not a food source, and (c) reduced herbivory on neighboring plants where the invasive has been removed. Removal of L. cuneata from experimental plots produced no overall effect on arthropod abundance; however, Japanese Beetles, a devastating invasive, were twice as abundant in plots with L. cuneata, indicating that Japanese Beetles prefer plots with L. cuneata (prediction a). L. cuneata removal did not significantly affect percent herbivory of potted native plants (“phytometers”) placed in plots to evaluate herbivory, however, L. cuneata phytometers had significantly higher total herbivory than native phytometers. These herbivory analyses do not support predictions (b) and (c): L. cuneata had higher herbivory than native species and there was no effect of L. cuneata removal on herbivory of native species. L. cuneata phytometers were very immature when placed in field plots, potentially before developing chemical defenses to deter herbivores. L. cuneata and Japanese Beetles may interact to mutually facilitate their invasion, whether it is through refuge-mediated apparent competition or another mechanism of invasion.",https://doi.org/10.30707/etd2019.fowler.j,70.76923076923077
"Competition and intraguild predation between the braconid parasitoid<i>Bracon hylobii</i>and the entomopathogenic nematode<i>Heterorhabditis downesi</i>, natural enemies of the large pine weevil,<i>Hylobius abietis</i>","Abstract In biological control programmes introduced natural enemies compete with indigenous enemies for hosts and may also engage in intraguild predation when two species competing for the same prey attack and consume one another. The large pine weevil, Hylobius abietis L. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is an important pest of coniferous reforestation in Europe. Among its natural enemies, the parasitoid Bracon hylobii Ratz. (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and entomopathogenic nematodes have potential as biological control agents. Both parasitoid and nematodes target the weevil larvae and, hence, there is potential for competition or intraguild predation. In this study, we examine the interaction of B. hylobii with the nematode Heterorhabditis downesi Stock, Griffin and Burnell (Nematode: Heterorhabditidae), testing the susceptibility of larvae, pupae and adults of B. hylobii to H. downesi and whether female parasitoids discriminate between nematode-infected and uninfected weevils for oviposition. In choice tests, when weevils were exposed to nematodes 1–7 days previously, no B. hylobii oviposited on nematode-infected weevil larvae. Up to 24 h, healthy weevils were twice as likely as nematode-infected ones to be used for oviposition. Bracon hylobii females did not adjust clutch size; nematode-infected hosts were either rejected or the parasitoid laid a full clutch of eggs on them. When nematodes were applied to the parasitoid feeding on weevil larvae, the nematodes parasitized the parasitoid larvae, there was a reduction in cocoon formation and fewer cocoons eclosed. Eclosion rate was not reduced when nematodes were applied to fully formed cocoons, but nearly all of the emerging adults were killed by nematodes.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007485308006287,61.81818181818182
Competition Between Aquatic Insects and Vertebrates: Interaction Strength and Higher Order Interactions,"Replicated experiments in artificial ponds demonstrated that an assemblage of aquatic insects competed with tadpoles of the frogs Hyla andersonii and Bufo woodhousei fowleri. We independently manipulated the presence or absence of aquatic insects, and the abundance of an anuran competitor (O or 150 Bufo w. fowleri per experimental pond), using a completely crossed design for two—factor variance analysis, and observed the responses of initially similar cohorts of Hyla andersonii tadpoles to neither, either, or both insect and anuran competitors. Insects and Bufo significantly depressed the mean individual mass at metamorphosis of Hyla froglets and the cumulative biomass of anurans leaving the ponds at metamorphosis. Neither insects nor Bufo affected the survival or larval period of Hyla. Insects also significantly reduced the mean mass of Bufo, showing that both anurans responded to competition from insects. The intensity of competition between natural densities of insects and Hyla tadpoles was comparable to the intensity of competition between Bufo and Hyla, as a density of 150 Bufo/1000 L.",https://doi.org/10.2307/1941637,51.666666666666664
Impact of intraspecific and intraguild predation on predator invasion and coexistence. Can exotic ladybeetles displace native species,"Exotic predators are more likely to replace related native species when these species not only compete for similar prey species, but also predate on the offspring of the native predators. In several groups of arthropods, however, this intraguild predation (IGP) is not only mutual, but also co-occurs with intraspecific predation (ISP or cannibalism). These different processes may have counteracting effects on species invasion and coexistence. In this study, we derived simple rules that describe under which combinations of IGP and ISP a predator species is able to invade into a stable predator-prey system, and under which conditions an invasion will results in displacement or in coexistence. This theory is then applied to species pairs of exotic and native lady beetles, to test if differences in IGP and ISP may play a role in the establishment of introduced exotic ladybeetles species (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) such as Harmonia axyridis in Europe and Coccinella septempunctata in North America. For an accurate estimation of the key processes we cannot rely on specific experimental data only, but take allometric relationships into account as well. For ladybeetles, IGP and ISP seem to be determined largely by size differences of the interacting larvae, thereby giving an overall advantage to the larger species. On the other hand, larger species generally have higher food requirements, which may give them a disadvantage in resource competition. The estimated levels of IGP, ISP and competitive ability of the interacting species can not fully explain the invasion by the two exotic ladybeetles species. _________________ Impact of Intraspecific and Intraguild Predation on Predator Invasion and Coexistence Second International Symposium on Biological Control of Arthropods 39 INTRODUCTION In recent years the invasive nature of two ladybeetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) has drawn considerable attention in the scientific literature. The originally Eurasian Coccinella septempunctata L. established and spread through the whole of North-America in the 70s and 80s (Alyokhin and Sewell 2004; Elliott et al. 1996). Later, in the mid 90s, the originally Asian Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) became established in various parts of North-America and more recently in some parts of Western Europe as well (Adriaens et al. 2003). Simultaneous with their establishment in new habitats a population decline of native species was observed. The establishment of C. septempunctata in arable fields in North America was followed by a dramatic decline of several native ladybeetles (including Adalia bipunctata L.) in these fields (Alyokhin and Sewell 2004; Elliott et al. 1996; Evans 2004; Wheeler and Hoebeke 1995). C. septempunctata also became the dominant ladybeetle species in apple orchards, pushing A. bipunctata to a second position (Brown 2003; Brown and Miller 1998). The later establishment of H. axyridis in orchards resulted in a local decline of especially this other exotic C. septempunctata (Brown 2003), but this pattern is not yet apparent in arable fields (Nault and Kennedy 2003). In none of the cases the exotic species has resulted in the exclusion of native species. Resource competition for aphid prey is a possible explanation for the decline in native species following the establishment of the exotic one (Evans 2004). However, no evidence is yet provided that the exotic species are better resource competitors than the native ones. Intraguild predation (IGP) between the exotic and native ladybeetles is regarded as the most likely reason for the spread of the exotic species and the subsequent reduction of native or earlier-established species (Yasuda and Ohnuma 1999). Lab studies indeed show that the IGP by the exotic species on native species is generally bigger than the reverse predation (Snyder et al. 2004; Yasuda et al. 2004), and that IGP between the two exotic species is in favour of H. axyridis (Yasuda and Ohnuma 1999). A complicating factor is that these predators not only feed on the juveniles of other predator species, but also on those from their own species. This cannibalism or Intraspecific Predation (ISP) may partly reduce the effect of IGP on population dominance. In this study we therefore start with reviewing the theory on the combined impact of IGP and ISP on population dynamics. Then we show how the strength of the different interand intraspecific interaction may be calculated, and use these values to derive predictions on invasibility and species coexistence. In the second part we include resource competition in our theory. How will the various coccinelids differ in competitive ability, and how will this alter our conclusions. Finally, we will discuss the realism of our simplifying assumptions, indicate how spatial and temporal avoidance, resource partitioning and metapopulation dynamics may affect our conclusions.",,44.642857142857146
Moving beyond linear food chains: trait-mediated indirect interactions in a rocky intertidal food web,"In simple, linear food chains, top predators can have positive indirect effects on basal resources by causing changes in the traits (e.g. behaviour, feeding rates) of intermediate consumers. Although less is known about trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) in more complex food webs, it has been suggested that such complexity dampens trophic cascades. We examined TMIIs between a predatory crab ( Carcinus maenas ) and two ecologically important basal resources, fucoid algae ( Ascophyllum nodosum ) and barnacles ( Semibalanus balanoides ), which are consumed by herbivorous ( Littorina littorea ) and carnivorous ( Nucella lapillus ) snails, respectively. Because crab predation risk suppresses snail feeding rates, we hypothesized that crabs would also shape direct and indirect interactions among the multiple consumers and resources. We found that the magnitude of TMIIs between the crab and each resource depended on the suite of intermediate consumers present in the food web. Carnivorous snails ( Nucella ) transmitted TMIIs between crabs and barnacles. However, crab–algae TMIIs were transmitted by both herbivorous ( Littorina ) and carnivorous ( Nucella ) snails, and these TMIIs were additive. By causing Nucella to consume fewer barnacles, crab predation risk allowed fucoids that had settled on or between barnacles to remain in the community. Hence, positive interactions between barnacles and algae caused crab–algae TMIIs to be strongest when both consumers were present. Studies of TMIIs in more realistic, reticulate food webs will be necessary for a more complete understanding of how predation risk shapes community dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2016.2590,29.0
Data from: Density-dependent indirect effects: apparent mutualism and apparent competition coexist in a two-prey system,"A predator consuming multiple prey species usually causes indirect effects. Apparent mutualism results when multiple prey species reduce predation risk for each other by altering a predator’s functional response. Short-term apparent competition occurs when multiple prey species increase predation risks for each other through the numerical response, i.e. increasing the predator’s birth rate, or aggregative response, i.e. attracting a higher density of predators. Our objectives in this study were to determine the aggregative response and 2-prey functional response of a predator and to examine indirect effects over a range of prey densities. We used the clam Macoma balthica and juvenile blue crabs Callinectes sapidus as prey for adult blue crabs. In laboratory experiments, we determined the single-prey functional responses of the crabs to each prey species and the 2-prey functional response. We combined the 2-prey functional response with the known blue crab aggregative response to clams to estimate field predation rates. Our model predicts that at low prey densities, clams and juvenile blue crabs exhibit apparent mutual- ism, whereas at high clam densities, this relation switches to short-term apparent competition. These unexpected results highlight the need to incorporate multiple aspects of predation at multiple scales when considering indirect effects.",https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12780455,21.11111111111111
Slow-Release Sachets of Neoseiulus cucumeris Predatory Mites Reduce Intraguild Predation by Dalotia coriaria in Greenhouse Biological Control Systems,"Intraguild predation of Neoseiulus cucumeris Oudemans (Phytoseiidae) by soil-dwelling predators, Dalotia coriaria Kraatz (Staphylinidae) may limit the utility of open rearing systems in greenhouse thrips management programs. We determined the rate of D. coriaria invasion of N. cucumeris breeder material presented in piles or sachets, bran piles (without mites), and sawdust piles. We also observed mite dispersal from breeder piles and sachets when D. coriaria were not present. Dalotia coriaria invaded breeder and bran piles at higher rates than sawdust piles and sachets. Furthermore, proportions of N. cucumeris in sachets were six- to eight-fold higher compared with breeder piles. When D. coriaria were absent, N. cucumeris dispersed from breeder piles and sachets for up to seven weeks. In earlier weeks, more N. cucumeris dispersed from breeder piles compared with sachets, and in later weeks more N. cucumeris dispersed from sachets compared with breeder piles. Sachets protected N. cucumeris from intraguild predation by D. coriaria resulting in higher populations of mites. Therefore, sachets should be used in greenhouse biocontrol programs that also release D. coriaria. Furthermore, breeder piles that provide ""quick-releases"" or sachets that provide ""slow-releases"" of mites should be considered when incorporating N. cucumeris into greenhouse thrips management programs.",https://doi.org/10.3390/insects6020489,21.0
The roles of habitat and intraguild predation by coyotes on the spatial dynamics of kit foxes,"Abstract Intraguild predation (IGP) by a dominant predator can drive the spatial dynamics of a subordinate predator and may explain space‐use patterns that deviate from theoretical predictions that species will use areas that maximize the availability of limited resources (resource availability hypothesis). Intraguild predation may suppress the distribution and abundance of mesopredators, but spatial resource partitioning may facilitate coexistence, with the subordinate carnivore utilizing suboptimal habitats. In arid systems, free‐standing water was historically scarce, limiting the distribution of larger‐bodied predators and offering large areas of refugia for smaller, arid‐adapted species, such as the kit fox ( Vulpes macrotis ). In these systems, the development of artificial water sources may facilitate an increase in the distribution and abundance of larger carnivores (e.g., coyotes [ Canis latrans ]), perhaps to the detriment of kit foxes. We coupled noninvasive genetic sampling and dynamic occupancy models to evaluate the spatial dynamics of kit foxes and their intraguild predators, coyotes, in western Utah, United States. We evaluated the influence of habitat characteristics on coyote occupancy patterns, and then investigated the role of habitat and coyotes on kit fox space use at multiple scales. Coyote occupancy was unrelated to water availability, but was positively related to the proportion of shrubland and woodland cover, a pattern consistent with predictions of the resource availability hypothesis. Supporting predictions of IGP theory, kit fox occupancy was negatively related to shrubland and woodland cover, minimizing overlap with land‐cover types favoring coyote occupancy. Furthermore, kit fox probability of local extinction was positively related to coyote activity. Interestingly, kit fox detection was positively related to coyote activity (i.e., kit fox detection was higher on spatial surveys with greater coyote sign), suggesting that at finer scales, kit foxes utilized riskier habitats to secure sufficient resources. Our results identified two alternative states predicted by IGP theory (i.e., intraguild predator dominated and coexistence of intraguild predator and intraguild prey) in a single system and elucidated the importance of considering dynamic processes and scale when investigating IGP.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1749,19.09090909090909
Facultative Intraguild Predation by Larval Cerambycidae (Coleoptera) on Bark Beetle Larvae (Coleoptera: Scolytidae): Fig. 1.,"Larvae of the Carolina sawyer Monochamus carolinensis (Olivier) (Cerambycidae) and bark beetle larvae (Scolytidae) often simultaneously feed in phloem of recently killed pine trees. Our investigations reveal that M. carolinensis larvae may act as facultative intraguild predators of bark beetle larvae. Phloem sandwiches were used in four experiments to examine inter- and intraspecific interactions. We discovered that all sizes of M. carolinensis larvae killed bark beetle larvae. Seventy-six percent of the killed bark beetle larvae were consumed by M. carolinensis, including 58% that were entirely ingested. Cannibalism in M. carolinensis occurred in every experimental trial. Based on this evidence, M. carolinensis, and possibly related cerambycid species associated with bark beetles, are facultative intraguild predators of larvae of other phloem inhabiting species. The consequences of this behavior may have important implications for bark beetle population dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1603/0046-225x-30.1.17,13.75
Keep Your Eggs Away: Ant Presence Reduces Ceratitis capitata Oviposition Behaviour through Trait-Mediated Indirect Interactions,"Alternative methods to achieve sustainable agricultural production while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, such as biological control, are increasingly needed. The exploitation of trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs), in which pests modify their behavior in response to some cues (e.g., pheromones and other semiochemicals) to avoid predation risk, may be a possible strategy. In this study, we tested the effect of TMIIs of two Mediterranean ant species, Crematogaster scutellaris and Tapinoma nigerrimum, on the oviposition behaviour of Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae), one of the world's most economically damaging pests, which attacks fruits. For each ant species, we performed choice experiments using ant-scented and control plums, counting the time spent by medflies on fruits and the number of pupae emerging from them. Results of both ant species tests showed a significantly shorter time spent by ovipositing medflies on ant-exposed plums and a lower number of pupae, when compared to the control group. Our findings highlighted that the semiochemicals released by ants on plums triggered an avoidance behaviour by medfly females, leading to lower oviposition rates. This study contributes to the understanding of indirect ant-pest interactions in Mediterranean agricultural settings and points out the potential of utilising ant-borne semiochemicals in sustainable IPM strategies.",https://doi.org/10.3390/insects14060532,12.857142857142858
Toxicity of CeO<sub>2</sub>nanoparticles on a freshwater experimental trophic chain: A study in environmentally relevant conditions through the use of mesocosms,"The toxicity of CeO2 NPs on an experimental freshwater ecosystem was studied in mesocosm, with a focus being placed on the higher trophic level, i.e. the carnivorous amphibian species Pleurodeles waltl. The system comprised species at three trophic levels: (i) bacteria, fungi and diatoms, (ii) Chironomus riparius larvae as primary consumers and (iii) Pleurodeles larvae as secondary consumers. NP contamination consisted of repeated additions of CeO2 NPs over 4 weeks, to obtain a final concentration of 1 mg/L. NPs were found to settle and accumulate in the sediment. No effects were observed on litter decomposition or associated fungal biomass. Changes in bacterial communities were observed from the third week of NP contamination. Morphological changes in CeO2 NPs were observed at the end of the experiment. No toxicity was recorded in chironomids, despite substantial NP accumulation (265.8 ± 14.1 mg Ce/kg). Mortality (35.3 ± 6.8%) and a mean Ce concentration of 13.5 ± 3.9 mg/kg were reported for Pleurodeles. Parallel experiments were performed on Pleurodeles to determine toxicity pathways: no toxicity was observed by direct or dietary exposures, although Ce concentrations almost reached 100 mg/kg. In view of these results, various toxicity mechanisms are proposed and discussed. The toxicity observed on Pleurodeles in mesocosm may be indirect, due to microorganism's interaction with CeO2 NPs, or NP dissolution could have occurred in mesocosm due to the structural complexity of the biological environment, resulting in toxicity to Pleurodeles. This study strongly supports the importance of ecotoxicological assessment of NPs under environmentally relevant conditions, using complex biological systems.",https://doi.org/10.3109/17435390.2015.1053422,11.875
The effect of copper stress on inter-trophic relationships in a model tri-trophic food chain.,"Soil fertility and management are paramount in ensuring food security for the growing populations. The use of agri-chemical and products containing heavy metals inadvertently threaten both food security and the surrounding ecosystems from contamination, loss of productivity or ecosystem service. In the present study a series of experiments on the toxic and adaptive responses of wheat plants to copper-induced stress were conducted to establish the effects of different levels of Cu (0 – 200 mg kg -1) on growth, nutrient levels and the total plant proteins of wheat seedlings (Triticum aestivum) using pot experiments. A tri-trophic food chain soil → plant → herbivore → predator was established as plants were infested with grain aphids (Sitobion avenae) which were subsequently fed to predatory ladybirds (Adalia bipunctata). Multiple measurements were conducted which deduced that Cu was taken up from soil into the plant tissues accumulating in the shoot and ear. The rate of growth and flag leaf length were affected by levels of Cu in the soil but total plant mass and ear weights were not. Wheat shoots and ears were analysed for N (crude protein) P, K and it was found that the levels of Cu in soils affected the levels of protein in both the shoot and the ear while the levels of P and K remained unaffected. Total populations of aphid and aphid fecundity appeared to be unaffected by the Cu stress-induced plants and no significant relationships between levels of N in plant tissues or flag leaf length were found. Ladybirds also appeared to be unaffected by the levels of Cu in soils as consumption rate or change in mass between the treatments was not significant. While the present study does not support a critical threshold for Cu levels in agricultural soils it can conclude that biological control methods are unaffected by levels of Cu in the soil.",,3.0
Insect-mediated apparent competition between mammals in a boreal food web,"Significance Despite the growing recognition that indirect interactions within species networks can determine food web dynamics, empirical evidence remains rare. We demonstrate how the impact of insects on forest structure and composition can reverberate across trophic levels by altering apparent competition in a large-mammal food web subjected to timber extraction. Spruce budworm outbreaks initiated a flush in deciduous vegetation that benefited moose, which translated into apparent competition between moose and boreal caribou through wolf predation. Mortality risk of caribou became indirectly related to patterns of insect and human activities, with the ungulate experiencing higher risk when selecting stands severely infested by budworms and subsequently logged. We expose cascading effects of insect–forest interactions on large-mammal relations in human-altered ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2022892118,0.0
Coexistence in diverse communities with higher-order interactions,"Abstract A central assumption in most ecological models is that the interactions in a community operate only between pairs of species. However, the interaction between two species may be fundamentally changed by the presence of others. Although interactions among three or more species, called higher-order interactions, have the potential to modify our theoretical understanding of coexistence, ecologists lack clear expectations for how these interactions shape community structure. Here, we analytically predict and numerically confirm how the variability and strength of higher-order interactions affect species coexistence. We found that, as higher-order interaction strengths become more variable across species, fewer species coexist, echoing the behavior of pairwise models. If inter-specific higher-order interactions become too harmful relative to self-regulation, coexistence was destabilized, but coexistence was also lost when these interactions were too weak and mutualistic effects became prevalent. Last, we showed that more species rich communities structured by higher-order interactions lose species more readily than their species poor counterparts, generalizing classic results for community stability. Our work provides needed theoretical expectation for how higher-order interactions impact species coexistence in diverse communities.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.04.483022,0.0
Coexistence in diverse communities with higher-order interactions,"A central assumption in most ecological models is that the interactions in a community operate only between pairs of species. However, two species may interactively affect the growth of a focal species. Although interactions among three or more species, called higher-order interactions, have the potential to modify our theoretical understanding of coexistence, ecologists lack clear expectations for how these interactions shape community structure. Here we analytically predict and numerically confirm how the variability and strength of higher-order interactions affect species coexistence. We found that as higher-order interaction strengths became more variable across species, fewer species could coexist, echoing the behavior of pairwise models. If interspecific higher-order interactions became too harmful relative to self-regulation, coexistence in diverse communities was destabilized, but coexistence was also lost when these interactions were too weak and mutualistic higher-order effects became prevalent. This behavior depended on the functional form of the interactions as the destabilizing effects of the mutualistic higher-order interactions were ameliorated when their strength saturated with species' densities. Last, we showed that more species-rich communities structured by higher-order interactions lose species more readily than their species-poor counterparts, generalizing classic results for community stability. Our work provides needed theoretical expectations for how higher-order interactions impact species coexistence in diverse communities.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2205063119,0.0
Higher order interactions and species coexistence,"Abstract Higher order interactions (HOIs) have been suggested to stabilize diverse ecological communities. However, their role in maintaining species coexistence from the perspective of modern coexistence theory is not known. Here, using generalized Lotka-Volterra model, we derive a general rule for species coexistence modulated by HOIs. We show that where pairwise species interactions fail to promote species coexistence in regions of extreme fitness differences, negative HOIs that intensify pairwise competition, however, can promote coexistence provided that HOIs strengthen intraspecific competition more than interspecific competition. In contrast, positive HOIs that alleviate pairwise competition can stabilize coexistence across a wide range of fitness differences, irrespective of differences in strength of inter- and intraspecific competition. In addition, we extend our three-species analytical result to multispecies communities and show, using simulations, that multispecies coexistence is possible provided that strength of negative intraspecific HOIs is higher than interspecific HOIs. Our work sheds light on the underlying mechanisms through which HOIs can maintain species diversity.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12080-020-00481-8,0.0
The mechanistic basis for higher-order interactions and non-additivity in competitive communities,"Motivated by both analytical tractability and empirical practicality, community ecologists have long treated the species pair as the fundamental unit of study. This notwithstanding, the challenge of understanding more complex systems has repeatedly generated interest in the role of so-called higher-order interactions (HOIs) imposed by species beyond the focal pair. Here we argue that HOIs - defined as non-additive effects of density on per capita growth - are best interpreted as emergent properties of phenomenological models (e.g. Lotka-Volterra competition) rather than as distinct 'ecological processes' in their own right. Using simulations of consumer-resource models, we explore the mechanisms and system properties that give rise to HOIs in observational data. We demonstrate that HOIs emerge under all but the most restrictive of assumptions, and that incorporating non-additivity into phenomenological models improves the quantitative and qualitative accuracy of model predictions. Notably, we also observe that HOIs derive primarily from mechanisms and system properties that apply equally to single-species or pairwise systems as they do to more diverse communities. Consequently, there exists a strong mandate for further recognition of non-additive effects in both theoretical and empirical research.",https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13211,0.0
Higher Order Interactions in Ecological Communities: What Are They and How Can They be Detected?,"The detection and significance of higher order interactions (HOIs) between species has been a matter of debate and experimentation in community ecology for several decades. HOIs are considered potentially significant because their presence is assumed to mean that the dynamic behavior of a full community of species is unpredictable based on observations of interactions between subsets of the species within the community. Despite such attention, the causal mechanisms that produce HOIs have been inadequately discussed. We discuss three different usages of the term HOIs and provide insight as to why HOIs might be found within a given community. HOIs may be detected for three reasons: inappropriate assumptions made concerning species interactions that influence statistical tests, unmeasured parameters and variables, and interaction modifications (i.e., a functional change in the interaction of two species caused by a third species. This confusion concerning the defining attributes of HOIs has made their detection problematic. While the statistical tests being used in the ecological experiments to detect HOIs are described in detail in most papers, the dynamic models underlying these tests are often not made explicit. Additionally, we demonstrate the equivalency of three different statistical tests: the Case and Bender (1981) test, analysis of variance, and a multiplicative test (Wootton 1994). However, the choice of a response variable (i.e., population densities, population growth rates, per—capita growth rates, etc.) and different data transformations applied to these response variables alter the underlying dynamics model that is being tested. The result is that the statistical test applied does not always perform the intended comparison but instead tests a different and sometimes unjustified or even inappropriate dynamic model. Finally, we review the relationship between indirect effects and HOIs. Whereas some researchers have lumped HOIs and indirect effects, we argue that the two represent completely unique and separate phenomena. Additionally, indirect effects can complicate detection of HOIs, and we review several methods by which to separate the two processes.",https://doi.org/10.2307/1939614,0.0
