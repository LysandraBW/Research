In addition to general advantages, we see specific benefits of a trait-based approach applied to the understanding of mycorrhizal and plant contributions to soil aggregation: (1) it will allow testing for the extent of root and mycorrhizal fungal functional complementarity with regard to soil aggregation, and thus whether soil aggregation is another example of an ecosystem process that positively relates to biodiversity like other more well-studied processes such as primary productivity.

The aggregation of soil is a complex process, regulated by a range of abiotic factors (e.g. texture) and mediated by plants and multiple biota groups and their interactions; in spite of this complexity, plant roots and their mycorrhizal symbionts are consistently found to be a crucial force in driving soil aggregation (Six et al., 2004; Rillig & Mummey, 2006; Leifheit et al., 2014).

In addition to general advantages, we see specific benefits of a trait-based approach applied to the understanding of mycorrhizal and plant contributions to soil aggregation: (1) it will allow testing for the extent of root and mycorrhizal fungal functional complementarity with regard to soil aggregation, and thus whether soil aggregation is another example of an ecosystem process that positively relates to biodiversity like other more well-studied processes such as primary productivity.
