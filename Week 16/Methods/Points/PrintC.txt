Smith), and co-occurring ant species in coffee agro-ecosystems testing whether phorids (1) limit A. instabilis recruitment activity, (2) affect competitive interaction between ant species, and (3) are associated with other species' resource access and therefore have the potential to change competitive hierarchies.
